		BRIEFER MENTION 17 NOTES 17 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 18 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 19 GEORGE SAND .

		The early days of this month are marked by two literary centenaries which will not be al - lowed to pass without appropriate commemora - tion .


Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	was born a hun - dred years ago , on the birthday of our existence as a nation ; and on the day following , in the first year of the
Napoleonic Empire	ORGANIZATION	, a French child was born to whom was given the name of
Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin	PERSON	.

		This name means little to the consciousness of the general reader , and hardly more is meant by the title of
Baronne de Dudevant	ORGANIZATION	, the name which that child was to assume upon the day of her mar - riage at the age of eighteen .

		But the whole world knows the name of
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	, under which , ten years later , this woman published the first of the long series of works of fiction that for more than half a century following were to flow from her facile pen .

		The two cen - tenaries -- American and French -- now at hand might afford the literary moralist occasion for an instructive comparison between our own American romancer and the ' Large-brained woman and large-hearted man ' of Mrs.
Broiwning	PERSON	's characterization , between the spirit of
New England Puritanism	ORGANIZATION	incarnate in the one and the more human gospel of
Rousseau	PERSON	made eloquent for a later age by the other .

		But we disclaim this ambitious task , and essay the simple one of recording a few impressions evoked by the memory of one of the two writers , choosing the Frenchwoman for our subject be - cause she seems less likely than our own Haw - thorne to be recalled to the recollection of the American reader .

		When
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	heard of the death of George Sand in
1876	DATE	, he wrote to his daughter as follows : ' Her death has been much in my mind ; she was the greatest spirit in our
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean world from the time that Goethe departed .

		With all her faults and Frenchism , she was this . '

		So pronounced an opinion from so weighty an authority , certainly gives us food for reflection .

		Some will probably dismiss the dictum as one of those unaccountable vagaries which the great critic occasionally permitted himself , others will hold it lightly as the un - guarded saying of a man not writing for pub - lication , and most will agree that it has in it some element of exaggeration .

		But making all
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, reasonable allowances for its circumstances and its subjective character , it still remains an im - pressive saying , and we must remember also that a year later
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	put himself deliberately on record to much the same effect in one of his carefully-wrought essays in liter - ary criticism .

		This high estimate , moreover , has found sup - port in the words of a long line of George Sand 's contemporaries and successors .

		From writers so different in temper as Mill and
Mazzini	PERSON	came substantially the same tribute to the beauty of her style and the nobility of her thought .


Frederic Myers	PERSON	called her ' the most noteworthy woman , with perhaps one excep - tion , who has appeared in literature since Sappho . '

		And
George Eliot	PERSON	, who is the subject of the possible exception just mentioned , wrote of her as follows : ' I can not read six pages of
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	without feeling that it is given to her to delineate human passion and its re - sults , and some of the moral instincts and their tendencies , with such truthfulness , such nicety of discrimination , such tragic power , and withal such loving humor , that one might live a cen - tury with nothing but one 's own dull faculties , and not know so much as those six will sug - gest . '

		And even Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, as far re - moved from her as the antipodes in his methods and his theories of literary art , accords her ' the highest literar -RCB- ^ instinct -- an art of composi - tion , a propriety and harmony of diction , such as belong only to the masters , ' and is con - strained to predict that in the coming days of the complete triumph of realism , her novels will have for our children 's children the sort of charm that
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's ' Fairy Queen ' has for us .

		Here is an impressive array of witnesses , and their testimony might be multiplied many times over from almost equally significant sources .

		Yet against it we must set the hard fact that
George Sand	PERSON	's novels are in our time demodes , that they are respectfully placed upon the shelf and left there to gather dust , that we do not recur to tlieir pages for a renewal of the emo - tions with which they thrilled our youth , that our younger generation has not read them at all .

		The writer herself did not anticipate a lasting fame . '

		I believe that in fifty years I shall be completely forgotten , ' she said to Flau - bert , ' but my idea has been rather to act upon my contemporaries , if only upon some of them , and to let them participate in my ideals . '

		But it is not easy to believe that a series of Avritings whose influence was so profound upon the world of a half-century past can reall -RRB- ' \ > e forgotten , or can fail to find in every new generation some devoted following .

		It is true that they belong to the literature of the romantic movement , which to us now is only a phase of literary his - tory ; but it is also true that they appeal in lovely and eloquent terms to some of the deep - est of the abiding instincts of human nature .

		With the English-speaking public at large ,
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	has never had a fair chance .

		Her introduction was brought about through the medium of her early novels -- those passionate rhapsodies of revolt which reflected the turmoil of an outraged soul groping blindly for light and peace .

		These books , coupled with strange and distorted reports of their author 's life , out - raged the smug self-righteousness of the mid - Victorian period , and settled the case of George Sand for good .

		The ripe and chastened work of her later years -- which means the whole of her work save only an insignificant fraction -- never got an adequate hearing in
England	LOCATION	, although , ^ we have seen , the nobler English spirits of the time were among her most appre - ciative admirers .

		In
America	LOCATION	, the case was nearly the same , although we are inclined to think that she has been judged with somewhat more of charity upon this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and found a wider acceptance for her gospel of democracy , of the dignity of labor , of passion - ate belief in the essential goodness of human nature , and of the just claims of the individual soul .

		It is a gospel that fits in at many points with the idealism which is the basis of our na - tional character , and could not fail to find a sympathetic hearing .

		Such a hearing it found particularly in the
Concord	LOCATION	circle , where the appearance of ' Consuelo ' was as important an event as the discovery of a new oriental relig - ion , and where a generous welcome was ex - tended to the author and her works .

		Philistin - ism remained blind to this revelation of spirit - ual beauty , but the elect did not fail to perceive that beneath and behind all these early out - pourings of passionate revolt and equally pas - , sionate aspiration there was , to use the fine phrase of Mr.
Myers	PERSON	, ' a certain unity and background of peace . '

		Those of us who have all along shared in that vision do not expect at this late day to send many readers back to a novelist whose work reached its climax of force in the forties and was completed in the seventies .

		There are more than a hundred volumes of
George Sand	PERSON	, and most of them are alread -RCB- ' consigned beyond re -
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL call to oblivion .

		But for a few of them -- the few that give the most typical expression of her faith and her many-sided charm -- we would suggest that they are better worth reading than almost any of the current productions upon which we waste our attention .

		They are worth reading , not merely because they exemplify a period of literary development , but because they still have power to stir the soul and strengthen the better impulses of our nature .

		And by way of a brief selection , we would suggest '
Valen	PERSON	- tine , ' for its lyrical passion and its loving de - scription of nature ; ' Mauprat , ' for its combined tenderness and strength ; ' L'Homme de Neige , ' for the pure and unaffected charm of its narra - tive ; ' La Mare au Diable , ' for its idyllic em - bodiment of rustic life ; ' Le
Marquis de Ville	PERSON	- mer , ' for its masterly study of aristocratic so - ciety , and ' Consuelo ' with ' La
Comtesse de Eudolstadt	ORGANIZATION	' its sequel , for their richly colored delineations of artistic life , their manifold pic - turesque incidents , and the lofty spirit that breathes in their rather shapeless form .

		For a course in George Sand , we confidently recom - mend these seven books , and feel sure that those who take it will be grateful to us for the coun - sel .

		George Sand herself speaks somewhere of ^ the literature of mysteries of iniquity , which men of talent and imagination try to bring into fashion . '

		Well , they have brought it into fash - ion , and most alarmingly , since her death .

		But the thoughts by which she was inspired have not lost their vitality , whatever the transforma - tions of our literary fashion .

		And we can not do better in closing than quote once more from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, who sums up his reflections in these words : ' The immense vibration of George Sand 's voice upon the ear of
Europe	LOCATION	will not soon die away .

		Her passions and her errors have been abundantly talked of .

		She left them behind her , and men 's memory of her will leave them behind also .

		There will remain of her to mankind the sense of benefit and stimulus from the passage upon earth of that large and frank nature , of that large and pure utterance -- the large utterance of the early gods ' COMMUNICA TION .

		HERBERT SPENCER ON HOMER 'S ' ILIAD . '

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		` Passing over its tedious euumeration of details of ■ dresses and arms , of chariots and horses , of blows given and received , filling page after page , -- saying nothing of the boyish practice of repeating descriptive names , such as ■ well-greavod Greel < s , long-haired Achseans , horse-breaking Trojans , and so forth -LRB- epithets which when not relevant to the issue are injurious -RRB- ; passing over , too , the many absurdities , such as giving the genealogy of a horse while in the midst of a battle , and not objecting that the subject - matter appeals continually to brutal passions and the instincts of the savage ; it suflBces to say that to me the ceaseless repetition of battles and speeches is intolerable .

		Even did the ideas presented raise pleasureable feelings , a lack of sufficiently broad contrasts in matter and manner would repel me . '

		Right or wrong , an honest , fresh , unhackneyed criticism should always be made an occasion of new light upon the merits of a great book ; for this result is sure to follow when the criticism is rightly discussed : the outcome must be either to establish more firmly our former admiration , or to modify it as it should be modified .

		But a culti - vated critic will not find it easy to appreciate Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's strictures on Homer , because to do so demands that one shall , for the time at least , assume Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's point of view .

		That Is to say , he must discover how he himself would be impressed by the ' Iliad ' if he had not formed his literary tastes largely upon Homer ; and he must consent to limit himself to an estimate of the essential value of
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's poetic ideas -- the entire content of his story , with its characters , passions , and incidents , -- as distinct from the worth of the poems as archagological records on the one side , and as artistry in words on the other .

		One who has been educated in the old classic curriculum will find it difl -LSB- icult to satisfy himself that no inconsiderable part of his admiration for Homer ,
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	, and
Horace	PERSON	, is due to the simple fact that he has been carefully trained to identify excellence with the practice of these authors .

		He was made to study them admiringly , line by line and word by word ; to account for each peculiarity of each verse as originating in some rule of art or in some principle of philosophy or psychology .

		It may happen that one has found out , in subse - quent years , that some of those rules of art were unfounded or trivial , and that some of those prin - ciples of psychology were delusions ; that the appli - cation of them was often forced , the result of a determination to make out , at all costs , that every word of the text is perfect .

		But , even so , it is not easy to cast off the habit of admiration , created by that prolonged training , sufficiently to become able to answer the question , ' If I had not been trained on Homer , if I had formed my literary standards on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and had then taken up Homer , how fully would he satisfy me ? '

		For centuries most educated English and American writers have accepted the
Bible	LOCATION	as the standard for religion , theology , ethics , and within a certain field for history ; but the classics were the stand - ard for taste .

		Some twenty years ago I heard a white-haired ' professor of Biblical Theology ' assert that , in comparison with
Isaiah	PERSON	and
Paul	PERSON	, Homer seemed to him to be but ` poppycock ' ; and a little earlier than that , I heard an intelli - gent reader of a wide selection of books say , ' When I have been reading
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, all other poets .

		Homer included , seem not to be strong meat , -- just food for babes . '

		The more I have pondered on this question the more difficult I have found it to assure myself that this second quota - THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, tion does not express the real and essential dif - ference between the two poets , as the first one , however inelegantly , measures the actual differ - ence between Homeric and Biblical divinity .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	read Homer only in translation , and so lost all that inheres in perfection of style ; but the points to which he directed attention are those as to which an author suffers least , if at all , in translation .

		Dignity and nobility of action , rationality of plot , complexity of characterization and charm of personality , the tendency to empha - size the noble and to slight the trivial , absence of childish credulity accompanied by hearty faith in the essentially human , discrimination between the human and the divine , a natural and unwarped order , -- in these and like matters a good trans - lation represents an original correctly and with fair adequacy .

		The style is dissipated in transla - tion , and with it vanish those finer touches of char - acterization that are given by the delicacies of style .

		No eulogium , therefore , upon the Homeric style can answer or much minimize objections brought against the contents of the poems when read in the original or in translation .

		So long as the translator has not originated the things assailed , the charge lies against the original Greek .

		If it be assumed that it is a matter of small consequence how unsatisfactory the contents of a poem may be , provided the style is perfect and a charming display of beauty is achieved , it might be worth while to try to learn what Homer under - took to do , what he himself seems to have cared for .

		Did he try to tell a story about the conduct and passions of men , or did he set out to charm his hearers by artistry in words ?

		I confess that I enjoy no such full and clear information about Homer as some critics claim to have obtained , -- Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	, for instance .

		He tells us that Homer is one of those authors ' who begin with the love of expression , and intent to be artists in words , and come through expression to profound thought . '

		How happy the man who knows all this !

		He must , at the least , have proof -LRB- 1 -RRB- that all the Homeric writings were the product of one mind ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the order in which that mind pro- duced his chants is known ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- that he can tell which of them were written as studies in style , and which to express thought .

		But , ignorant as I am , I can only consult the immortal verses to learn what the poet supposed , or perhaps pre - tended , that he was about .

		He asserts -LRB- or should I say ` they ' assert ? -RRB-

		a purpose to let the world know about the wrath of Achilles and its destruc - tive consequences .

		Possibly if he had been more candid he would have entreated his muse to sup - ply some thousands of dactyls and spondees , duly variegated with colors of vowel-play , alliteration , ' PVF , ' and all such elements of the music of speech .

		But so long as he set down In plain words his professed purpose , I can only accept it as the real motive of his work , and must assume that his art was only his charming means of car - rying his message straight and strongly to the bosom of men .

		If the question were as to
Milton	LOCATION	or
Shelley	PERSON	, one could be quite sure -LRB- since they were not humorists -RRB- that they would have felt insulted rather than stimulated to laughter by the suggestion that they cared more for beauty of expression than for the truth expressed .

		Imag - ine
Shelley	PERSON	, returned to earth incognito , and listening to the expounding of his ' Ode to the West Wind , ' with its ' Be thou me , impetuous one !

		Drive my dead thoughts over the universe .

		Like withered leaves , to quicken a new birth ; And by the incantation of this verse .

		Scatter , as from an unextinguished hearth Ashes and leaves , my words among mankind I Be through my lips to unawakened earth The trumpet of a prophecy ! '

		followed by the comment : ' Of course , inasmuch as
Shelley	PERSON	was an artist , he could not have cared much for his ideas -LRB- for which only a Philistine reader would search his poetry -RRB- , but must have valued his work mainly for the profusion and beauty of his images , for the music of the lines , and for the ease with which he mastered the diffi - cult terza rima , etc ' Surely , his orthodox enemies would wish him no worse torment than to .

		be so considered b , y his professed admirers .

		But as to Homer , does anyone , unless it be ' Q. ' know whether he -LRB- or they -RRB- would feel outraged , or moved to ' inextinguishable laughter , ' by such an idea as to the aim of his twenty-four books ?

		Some years ago the charge was made that the subject of the ' Iliad ' was essentially unworthy to be made the theme of a great poem , inasmuch as it was reducible to a quarrel over the posses - sion of a captive woman . '

		Christopher North ' -LRB- if my memory is not at fault , -- I read the papers about forty years ago -RRB- stood forth as the poet 's champion , and argued that a woman is well worth fighting for , and nothing more so .

		I read his defence when just finishing three years of service in the army of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and did not quite accept the proposition that my own soldiering had been for a cause no more noble than ownership of a fair slave ; I wondered also how the English edu - cated classes would rank the motives of Welling - ton at
Waterloo	LOCATION	compared with the reason for which Achilles sulked in his tents .

		But I could not but admire the frankness and candor with which the champion entered the fray .

		He did not dodge the question by sliding off into laudation of style ; he did not dismiss the charge with pity or scorn of a critic so ignorant as to suppose that adequacy and nobility of motive is a topic of liter - ary criticism , -- he met the issue as it had been presented .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's strictures on Homer should be weighed in the same frank manner .

		The call is for the consideration of but three ques - tions .

		Do the Homeric poems contain the things which Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	claims to have detected in them ?

		If they are there , are they blemishes or not ?

		If they are blemishes , how serious are they , when considered in their totality in relation to the entire poems ?

		To discuss these questions is to exhibit real regard for the reputation and influence of the majestic Greek : to laugh at them , to pity a man who can ask them , to substitute for them rhapsodies on the Homeric style , is in very truth to confess judgment , supposing that the defeat can be covered up by shouting .

		A Xe ^ v Observer in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		* It is something of a paradox to say that one finishes Mr.
Lander	PERSON	's large book with a feeling of knowing more about the
Philippines	LOCATION	than ever before , and , considering the extraordi - nary opportunities afforded the traveller , vastly less than he had reason to expect .

		For Mr.
Landor	PERSON	is always in search , primarily , of adventure ; and , having that , is satisfied .

		After seeing almost all the different peoples of the islands , he suggestively styles them ` bewilder - ing tribes ' ; and in this the reader will doubt - less agree with him .

		Of his attainments in one almost essential regard , he himself speaks in the paragraph following : ' In a virgin forest of this kind there is more than plenty to interest and puzzle any botanist , but an average man , like the writer , gets simply bewildered by the incredible variety of trees and the dense mass of them ; by the unaccountable number of orchids and other creeping and para - sitic plants which hang or stick out or sprout everywhere upon the larger trees ; by the astonish - ing toughness of the numberless creepers and fibres which hang from everywhere , -- and all this in the moist , suffocating , used-up air of the dark forest , where sunlight in all its intensity never penetrates , so that it seems incomprehensi - ble how the luxuriant undergrowth can not only exist but flourish as it does .

		It was interesting to watch the strain of the larger trees to force their way up and obtain air .

		Many of them were devoid of branches up to a great height . '

		It will be noted that this describes a forest in tropical
America	LOCATION	quite as accurately as in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, and that the last sentence even contains a fact quite as true of the temperate zone and its forest trees .

		This is typical of the entire book .

		There is an equal failure to discriminate in regard to matters best worth dwelling upon , of which another instance may be found in the account of the visit to the
Cal	LOCATION	- amians , told thus : ' We were confronted by a curious tree which had a large horizontal branch on which were thir - ty-seven vertical cuts .

		Now , according to some authority , these notches denote the age of the man who cut them -- but I think this is not so ; first , because I rather doubt whether the Tagbanouas could mark the time more exactly than by the rainy and dry seasons ; then because these marks did not appear to me as if they had been cut at great inter - vals of time . '

		Three more conjectures are then taken up and disposed of , leaving the reader wondering • The Gem.s of the

		why an observation so profitless should be made at all . -RSB-

		Mr.
Lander	PERSON	's point of view is characteris - tically British in its feeling of superiority to the rest of the world , and not in the least what Americans thinJc of as English in other respects .

		He loves to tell of himself in the most peril - ous predicaments , and as remaining absolutely cool and collected whatever befalls .

		There is always a self-Taunting that one is forced to feel is not waiTanted ; and this is quite as character - istic of his latest as of his earliest work .

		Against defects like these must he placed advantages resulting from the unusual length of the Journey , and the fact that it was taken under government auspices and with every aid that the local authorities of the
United States	LOCATION	could give .

		The account is essentially of a popular nature , with much vagueness of detail .

		Though half the space in the book is felt to be wasted , what remains does give a general impression of the archipelago and of the results of American occupancy there not found else - where ; and this gives the work a real value .

		j \ Ir .

		Landor impresses his readers with a sense of the experimental character of the work the American government is doing in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		There appears to be no desire to profit by the experience of other colonial administrators , not even those of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the closely related countries of
Borneo	LOCATION	and the Malayan peninsula , but rather to solve every problem afresh from the vantage-ground of American democracy ; something which Mr.
Landor	PERSON	can not comprehend , much less sympa - thize with .

		It appears that the American authorities are experimenting with leper col - onies , with stock farms , with schools , with wages , with food for their soldiers , with tribe after tribe of natives , and that success in any one thing seems remote .

		This brings one to the second impression left by the book in regard to American occupancy : that everything is to be done in a rush .

		Relig - ion is left free from experiment in a degree , but in every other respect of the life of such of the Filipinos as have fallen under the flag there is to be immediate and j > ermanent re - form .

		They are to learn the English language as spoken by American school-teachers , and al > andon their o \ vn .

		They are to take up lines of industry in which they are not in the least interested , and become brisk , businesslike , and untropical , straightway .

		Nothing seems more to annov the American who is accustomed 8
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, to getting things done , Mr.
Landor	PERSON	records , than Philippine inertia .

		Yet he notes that he had no difficulty in obtaining men to do the work incidental to his journey , and that he saw men who had refused to work under
Ameri	PERSON	- can direction for five times the ordinary wage cheerfully laboring under ecclesiastical stimu - lus for little or nothing .

		While governors and others in authority , with whom Mr.
Landor	PERSON	conversed , admitted nearly all that he had to say in favor of Brit - ish colonial methods , wherein a few English - men direct the work of many thousands of natives , as in
India	LOCATION	,
Malaya	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	, there was always behind the American admissions a sense of having another , a better , and a more expeditioi ^ way .

		To borrow a figure from geology .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	believes in the evolution - ary , American in the catastrophic theory of rul - ing men of another color .

		Significant , too , is such a statement as this : ' One can not help being struck by the splendid way in which the Spaniards did everything , down to the most minute details , in public works .

		There was no shabbiness about them .

		Everything was made in a practical way , and made to last , -- a great contrast to the American way , which builds everything flimeily and temporarily .

		Where Americans put up bridges of wood , which tumble down with the first rain , and cut down roads with - out metalling them , so that they are soon over - grown with vegetation and impassible with mud , the Spaniards built solid bridges of masonry , Iron or of strong , well-tarred wood on cantilever prin - ciples . '

		To support this generalization , many specific instances are cited ; and in curious contrast to this criticism goes an unbounded respect for the * Americans who are doing something , ' and a contempt equally unbounded for those who find fault at a distance .

		For the men in real authority , Mr.
Landor	PERSON	has nothing but praise ; and he is equally unstinted in his admiration for the fighting qualities of the American sol - dier , whom he saw in action at the taking of the Baoolod fort ?

		.

		Yet he speaks of the unpromising material of which the administra - tive subordinates is made in part , and he reads a really terrific indictment against the intem - perance introduced into the islands by the Americans wherever it has been possible .

		And for our manners to the natives -LRB- the same charge is brought against the English gener - ally -RRB- he has blame in abundance .

		Finally , he sums up in two sentences the general effect of the contact of the Caucasian upon the hopeless mixture of races he has de - lineated , bv saving , ' The more civilized the province , the greater the crime , ' and ' Person - ally my experience was that the less Christian - ized the people the nicer they were . '


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Personality and Teachings of T olsto y. * However one may regard Tolstoy as an in - fluence -- whether he be classified as the great - est moral leader of the century or as an incon - sistent fanatic , whether he stands forth in men - tal vision as ' The Grand Mujik ' or as a mere poseur , -- there is interest among all readers in the personality and romantic environment of the man .

		Hence the earnest and the curious alike will enjoy the portrayal of him by one of his most sympathetic and grateful visitors of recent years .

		Dr.
Edward Steiner	PERSON	.

		Renewing an acquaintance of student days in
Germany	LOCATION	, with treasured memories of the magnetic in - fluence then exerted , the author has in full ma - turity placed himself again under the sway of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's presence , has examined by direct and intuitive processes the elements of his char - acter , and has described the prophet-novelist and his home region with vividness and force .

		From recollections of Tolstoy in
Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, gathered through intimate contact with both the peasantry and the cultured classes , Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	has interwoven incidents and traits into a faithful pictorial background for the portrait of his hero .

		In the main the estimate is well-balanced , with just enough of personal enthusiasm to give the work a graphic force .

		Though at times lenient to a fault as to some minor flaw of temperament , the author has not seriously digressed from his avowed pur - pose , -- ' That I may not dim his glory , and yet not unduly exalt him , that I may not misrep - resent him and yet truthfully present him to view , that I may satisfy the curious and yet bring them nearer to the source of the teach - ings of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, which is the
Gospel of Jesus	ORGANIZATION	, this is my only desire . '

		THE DIAL young manhood even more gracious in illness and old age ^ still a rapt listener to music and conversation , deeply concerned for the welfare of all classes and all nations .

		The changes that have taken place during these forty years in
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life and that of
Eussia	LOCATION	, the steps by which he has both progressed and retrogressed as an artist in fiction , the spiritual struggles through which he has passed in evolving his unique and paradoxical moral code , are treated at length in this study of his personality .

		Tracing many of his peculiarities to his isolated childhood and to his manhood of indulgence , operating in turn upon a mind of deep specu - lative impulses , his life in the army is likened to the parable of the Prodigal Son .

		Here he * came to himself , ' wakened not alone to his moral depravity and the broader questions of ethics in war and society , but realized also his literary possibilities .

		In this study of his life , critical and expository comments on his fiction are supplementary to the main motive -- the effort to trace the development of the man 's mind and soul as revealed through his works , from the slighter sketches of '
Sebastopol	PERSON	' and ' The Cossacks ' to the novels of thrilling prob - lems , '
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, ' '
Kreutzer Sonata	PERSON	, ' and ' Resurrection . '

		With a careful inquiry re - garding the effect of each event in shaping char - acter , the author outlines the years of travel , the years of absorbing domestic life , the experi - ments in teaching and husbandry among the peasants , and the gradual alienation of many disciples and even some members of his fam - ily , because of his persistent and seemingly in - consistent theories on marriage , education , and government .

		At the zenith of his fame and promise as a novelist , and the culmination of his home-happiness ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	was inwardly pass - ing through a crisis so severe that it menaced his reason and his life .

		From this struggle he emerged with a new gospel , familiar to us through the tracts , ' My Confession , ' and ' My Religion , ' as well as in his later fiction .

		Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	offers no labored logic to systematize or harmonize these later ideas of the moral teacher .

		He states them with clearness , and emphasizes the effects of such teachings upon his neighbors in spirit throughout the world .

		Returning to the primal purpose of the volume , he gives a graphic narrative of the ' two worlds in the Tolstoy household , ' pays strong deference to the graces and efficiency of the Countess , and presents in vivid contrasts the classes of visitors and parasites .

		The relations between
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and Turgenieff always awaken literary interest , and we are given a recital of their early friend - ship , their later misunderstanding and open quarrel , and the reconciliation and fulfilment of
Turgenieff	ORGANIZATION	's prophecies for
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's art .

		In his summary , the author has laid stress upon
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's simplicity and zeal for truth in Ms life and writings , while the creed that has brought forth so many exhaustive statements by theologians and sociologists has been succintly phrased , ' God is his father , all men are his brethren . '

		The volume gains materially in in - terest from the illustrations , in color , by the friend of the
Tolstoy	PERSON	family , the Russian artist Pasternak .

		In marked contrast with the plan and form of the volume just cited is the study of Tol - stoy 's religious and social tenets , by Mr.
Knowl	PERSON	- son .

		The volume devoted to
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's personal - ity was intended primarily for journal narra - tive , and portions of it appeared in ' The Outlook . '

		Its style is pictorial and somewhat discursive .

		The peculiar qualities of Mr.
Knowlson	PERSON	's study , on the other hand , are con - ciseness and logical sequence .

		There is a brief but suggestive account of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's external life as boy and man , and a forceful development of his altruism , his love for nature , and his re - version from the type of an aristocrat to that of a would-be peasant .

		In his analysis of Tol - stoy as a novelist , the author gives him high praise for characterization , scenic skill , and dramatic motives .

		In choice of characters and setting , he draws an analogy between
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	; a comparison met with be - fore in current criticism .

		In style , in natural - ness , in emphasis of Hhe primary passions of life as forming the best material for represent - ing life in its dramatic intensity , ' these authors present noteworthy resemblances .

		Witii an acknowledgment that
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's tenets are never fully expounded , Mr.
Knowlson	PERSON	distinguishes between
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	as a moralist rather than a philosopher , and examples the mysticism , the asceticism , and the noble charity of his creed , by ample quotations from such of his treatises as ' What I Believe , ' ' The Christian Teaching , ' ' Patriotism and
Government	ORGANIZATION	. '

		With justifiable frankness , the inconsistences of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's beliefs are shown ; but the author has emphasized two significant thoughts as a result of his study , -- first ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has a sincere purpose to live lit - erally as near like Christ as he can under the contradictions of his environment , to '' which purpose may be traced some of the views most 10 THE DIAIi -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, at variance with accepted Christian doctrines of today ; second ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's inflvience in
Russia	LOCATION	and the outside work !

		is great though unde - iinable .

		Of much of his teaching one may well say , ' This is idealism , but it is not life ' ; but with equal candor one must admit , '
Leo Tol	PERSON	- stoy is a world-character who in some directions will tecome a world-force ... This ranch , however , may be said for the Iiussian idealist , -- that of all schemes for universal good his is the mightiest in its
Universality	LOCATION	, in its attempt at Uniformity , and in its plea for bringing all inharmonious elements into Unity . '

		This study of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's writings and doctrines has a val - uable bibliograph -RCB- '' but neither this volume nor that by Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	has any index , -- a serious inconvenience in books so general in character .

		UTIOX .

		* The initial volume of Sir
George Otto Tre	PERSON	- velyan 's History of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, which has been for some years before the pub - lic , is now supplemented by an instalment of the work in two volumes , which justifies the expectations of the author 's friends that he would furnish at least a highly acceptable accmmt of the events of that era .

		It is not possil -RRB- le and proper to say that
Trevelyan	PERSON	's is destined to be one of the leading histories of that revolution .

		These two volumes cover only the years of 17 io and
1776	DATE	; but no less space could well be taken for that period , and the de - liberation with which Trevelyan proceeds with his - work - is M ^ arranted by his thoroughness .

		This historian deems the events of that period to be of too commanding importance to allow any - but the most painstaking research or the most considerate recital .

		As evidently planned by him , the diistory when completed will be upon a scale commensurate with the colossal character of the transformation of thirteen feeble British colonies into a Federal Republic of marvellous promise and potency .

		It is his purpose to exhibit this evolution from a Brit - ish point of view , but unembarrassed l -RRB- y British prejudice .

		His sympathy with the American side of ` the controversy which provoked the rev - olution is .

		pronounced than that shown by either
Bryce	PERSON	or Dicey in their commentaries , broader and more persistent than the partial friendliness of
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	.

		Trevelyan sees both sides of the great con - troversy , and writes for readers on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	; and he relates in detail the English contention and views , no less than those of
America	LOCATION	.

		The merits of the original con - troversy , and the strength of the dialectics in which it was at first waged , he finds to have been distinctly with the Americans .

		Here ap - pears a transatlantic historian , ready to help rescue the history of that era from the
Philis	LOCATION	- tines , on both sides of the sea , who would dis - tort and misstate it .

		Trevelyan 's pages should rejoice the critical heart of Mr.
T. E. Watson	PERSON	, who in his recent account of the ' Life and Times of
Jefferson	PERSON	' deplores the fact that ' a tendency has been show 'n by some historians to justify
Great Britain	LOCATION	and to blame the col - onies , ' and who repudiates the charge that
America	LOCATION	' started a quarrel without just cause , and kept it up in spite of all attempts at recon - ciliation . '

		Trevelyan notes the same tendency in some American writers .

		Scrutinizing it , he finds it due largely to a revolt against the ful - some panegyric sometimes bestowed on the co - lonial leaders .

		But he demurs to the historical value of the criticism which condemns such ex - treme praise , and says that whatever may be the merits of the criticism in other respects , ` as an argument for or against the British policy , it is of no account at all . '

		He adds tliat ' the question to be determined , at successive points of the American controversy , was in every case a clear and simple issue ' ; and he declines to be ranked among the apologists for the hard - headed British leaders who , ` over and over again , at a very great crisis , adopted a wrong course , in defiance of the opinion strongly held and fearlessly urged by many of the best and most far-seeing of their own contemporaries . '

		How fair and unprejudiced appear to be the judgments advanced by
Trevelyan	ORGANIZATION	, in respect to the leaders in his own country in that stren - uous time , can not well be illustrated within the limits of a review , but will apjiear clearly to those who read his pages .

		The office thus assumed by
Trevelyan	ORGANIZATION	, of tell - ing his countrymen the unpleasant truth about the harsh manner in which their forefathers treated their American cousins , is but a con - tinuation or a renewal of the task which his kinsman
Macaulav	PERSON	had set for himself ; for it
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 was his design , as Trevelyan states , to continue his ' History of
England	LOCATION	' down to a date within the memory of his own contemporaries , and to show to them ' how imprudence and ob - stinacy broke the ties Avhich bound the ISTortli American colonies to the parent state . '

		Three chapters are devoted by the author to illustrating the condition and peculiarities of i > uhlic sentiment in
England	LOCATION	at the outbreak of the war , the disfavor with which the
King	ORGANIZATION	's l3elligerent plans were received and thwarted in many quarters , and his numerous unsuccess - ful attempts to enlist the services of eminent and influential public men in the active prosecu - tion of the war .

		We are shown in detail the whole array of discontent , criticism and popu - lar opposition , which made it impossible for the King to send native Britons in sufficient force to make the attempt to overawe the Americans , and forced him to hire foreign mer - cenaries .

		It may well gladden the hearts of Americans to recall that their English brethren were so generally in sympathy with the ' Brit - ons in i \ merica ' as to create the royal need for foreign legions ; so that there was , after all , a silver lining to the dark and ugly Hessian cloud .

		It seems but natural that the influence of Macaulay should appear upon almost every page of our author 's work ; in his literary and historical style , in his ideas as to the demands of historical narrative upon the narrator , in his choice of historical perspective , in his fre - quent resort to personal portraiture , in his slight regard for the details of campaigns , and in his preference for tracing the path of progress by exhibiting the influence of motives and forces in historical movements , as shown in particular episodes .

		The pains taken by
Parson Gordon	PERSON	to collect data for his history of the revolution , and his appeal to British favor by publishing his work , after the war , in
England	LOCATION	, where it fell flat by reason of its lack of fidelity to his great subject ; the develop - ment of the revolution in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	senti - ment , out of colonial Toryism and into stal - wart Americanism ; the influence of the pub - lication and circulation of Paine 's ' Common Sense , ' in
1776	DATE	, in working a great change in public opinion and fostering the thought that the assumption of independence was a timely and national duty , -- such are some of the epi - sodes graphically set forth in these pages .

		If the author 's sympathy with the Americans in their heavy struggle were not otherwise ap - parent , it would be disclosed in the evident pleasure with which he recites many an anec - dote illustrating the feeling and the spirit which animated the leading revolted colonists , -- such , for instance , as the calm and un - ruffled determination displayed by
Franklin	PERSON	,
Adams	PERSON	, and
Rutledge	PERSON	, and the quick-witted repartee of their replies to
Lord Howe	ORGANIZATION	in their conference with him over his desire to promote a reconciliation .

		In its honhommie , and its re - gard for the finer and nobler elements of hu - manity ,
Trevelyan	PERSON	's work reminds one of
John Fiske	PERSON	's ; and while American readers would not willingly lay aside
Fiske	PERSON	's history of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Eevolution , they ` will no doubt be pleased to supplement it with
Trevelyan 's	ORGANIZATION	.


James Oscar Pierce	PERSON	.

		New Stltdies of Society axd Literature .

		* Probably few other men of his time knew the eighteenth century more intimately or stud - ied it more sympathetically than the late Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		His ' English Thought in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, ' first published in
1876	DATE	, remains the greatest work in its field ; his biographies of Swift , Pope , and
Johnson	PERSON	are works of surpassing merit .

		In ' English Litera - ture and Society in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, ' being the Ford Lectures delivered last year at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and published since his lamented death , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has left us a highly illuminating discussion of certain general aspects of literary history which the text-books too rarely touch upon .

		He recognizes the change in the meth - ods of criticism , which has largely abandoned the administration of a fixed code of laws for the historical attitude , and which now asks first what pleased men and then why .

		Adequate criticism must therefore be rooted in history ; between literature and general social condi - tions there exists a close connection .

		If we would understand the weakness of Elizabethan literature , as well as its excellences , we must study the complexities of Elizabethan society .

		From this point of view , then , he surveys the literary output of the century of Addison and
Johnson	PERSON	and
Burke	PERSON	; of Walix -RRB- le and
Chatham	LOCATION	; of Deism and the Methodist revival .

		At the opening of the century , the Wits formed ■ ' a kind of island of illumination amid the sur - rounding darkness of the agricultural country . '

		With the breaking up of club and coffee-house society , the age of the Wits was succeeded by that in which Pope dominated , an age which called for satire , and which found
Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's good-natured cynicism agreeable .

		Meanwhile the plebeians grew into promi - nence , and after
Walpole	LOCATION	's death literature was more and more distinctly addressed to the middle class .

		The professional critic appeared .

		Moral and religious reading was demanded .

		Though the aristocratic order was accepted as inevitable , there was a growing feeling that the rulers were corrupt .

		It is the time of the moralist , and of the birth of the novel or por - trait of manners .

		The age of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	, which succeeded , is in literature an age of stagnation .

		The industrial revolution took place ; in politics the democratic movement appeared , led , however , by men who ` proposed to remove abuses , not to recast the whole system . '

		A society independent of the aristocracy had grown up , ' which is already be - ginning to be the most important social stratum and the chief factor in political and social de - velopment . '

		The watchword of every literary school may be stated as a ' return to Nature ' ; and the lec - ture concludes by showing that the difference between the various schools lies in the different interpretations of the formula .

		For
Addison	PERSON	, Swift , Pope , it meant , be rational , avoid pedantry ; in the period of Eichardson and Fielding , middle-class
John Bull	PERSON	demands por - traits of real living men and .

		women , and re - pudiates aristocratic rationalism ; in the demo - cratic period , cant and sham sentimentalism are condemned and realism is demanded , even though it be served in old bottles .

		Somewhat along this line does our author conduct us in a survey of the century which above all others exhibits a prevailing temper akin to his own -- a distrust of enthusiasm , a love of common-sense , a perception of historic continuity .

		We lay down the book with re - gret ; for the hand that wrote it is still , and has left no successor .

		The typography of the volume is commend - able ; we wish , however , that it had been pro- vided with a descriptive table of contents , run - ning-heads , and an index .

		The Birth-D ate o f
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	's monograph on the date of
Columbus	LOCATION	's birth is an interesting discussion of a much controverted subject .

		Columbus him - self never stated his age , but made various statements respecting the length of different periods of his life .

		As these statements are contradictory , and all are of equal authority , Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	rejects the computations based upon any of them .

		The only statement of Co - lumbus 's age made by any of his contemporaries is that of
Bernaldez	LOCATION	, that he died in
1506	DATE	' at a fine old age , being about seventy . '

		This state - ment was the basis of the conclusions of early biographers that he was born in
1436	DATE	.

		Its form indicates that it was an estimate rather than a statement of positive knowledge .

		Since it has become apparent , from facts discovered in regard to his family , that
Columbus	LOCATION	could scarcely have been born as early as
1436	DATE	, it has been suggested that the transcriber wrote setenta , seventy , instead of sesenta , sixty , a change of only one letter .

		If
Columbus	LOCATION	was sixty at the time of his death , he was bom about
1446	DATE	; and this date has been the favorite one with recent biographers .

		This assumed error in transcription is open to the objection that if
Bernaldez	PERSON	had meant sixty he would hardly have called it ` a. fine old age . '

		The latest estimates of the date of
Colum	PERSON	- bus 's birth are based upon certain notarial doc - uments executed by him and by members of his family .

		The most important of these is an acknowledgment of debt , executed in
1470	DATE	, with the consent of his father , which describes him as ' a major of nineteen years . '

		Mr.
■ Harrisse	PERSON	takes this to mean that
Columbus	LOCATION	was at that time between nineteen and the full age of twenty-five , and hence was bom between
1445	DATE	and
1451	DATE	.

		Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	, following a sugges - tion made by Mr ,
Richard Davey	PERSON	in
1892	DATE	and since accepted by
Senor de La Rosa	ORGANIZATION	, thinks that ' a major of nineteen ' means a major nine - teen years of age ; and that
Columbus	LOCATION	, being nineteen in
1470	DATE	, was born in
1451	DATE	.

		In Genoan law there were majors of sixteen , seventeen , and eighteen , under the full age of twenty - five , but no major of nineteen ; hence the ex - pression ' major of nineteen ' could mean noth - ing but a major of that age .

		The objection to this construction rests upon a ratification , in

		THE DIAL 13 brother , of a sale made or to be made by the father .

		The parental consent , incorporated in the original draft of the deed , was afterward struck out by the notary .

		From this ratifica - tion it has been inferred that the brothers were of full age in
1473	DATE	, and that the elder must have been born as early as
1446	DATE	.

		Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	argues that the formal consent of parents to an act approving an a `` t of their own would have been superfluous , and that its inclusion and subsequent omission indicate nothing as to the age of the sons , since the requirement of parental consent was independent of age and might be necessary even to majors of twenty - five .

		He does not , however , raise the questions why the sons ratified at all , whether they could be brought in as interested parties during their minority , and whether consent given them would be subsequently binding .

		Two years earlier , the mother ratified a similar sale with - out the assistance of the sons .

		Why did they join in one act , and not in the other , unless their legal status had changed in the mean time ?

		It would seem , therefore , that more light is needed , either upon the condition of the parties or upon the requirements of the law , before the question can be regarded as finally settled .

		Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	does not discuss the relation of the birth-date of
Columbus	LOCATION	to his life , but clearly implies that
Columbus	LOCATION	intentionally misled his contemporaries as to his age in order to allow time for the voyages and studies he claimed to have made .

		The 19th Century In ' The History of the Nine - as depicted tcenth Century in Caricature ' in caricature .

		-LRB- p ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ j ^ ^ ^ ^ Company -RRB- Mr.
Arthur Bartlett Maurice	PERSON	and Mr.
Frederic Taber Cooper	PERSON	have traced the course of the art in question from the beginning of political cari - cature through the Napoleonic era , during the days of
Waterloo	LOCATION	and the Crimean War , the Civil and the
Franco-Prussian Wars	ORGANIZATION	, to the end of the century .

		Although
Hogarth	PERSON	antedates by half a century the period covered by the present work , it has been deemed essential to recapitu - late the achievements of the great domestic painter , -- although his powers in the line of caricature , properly so called , while great , were subordinate to his higher merits as a painter of ` genre , ' as the French term it , a delineator of popular incidents into which the humorous only entered as an ingredient .

		Of
Gillray	PERSON	, the
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- bens of caricature during the Napoleonic wars , it is said : ' There is rancor , there is venom , there is the inevitable inheritance of the warfare of centuries , in tliese caricatures of
Gillray	PERSON	, but above all there is fear -- fear of
Napoleon	PERSON	, of his genius , of his star . '

		French art during the same period , refined and softened into effem - inacy under the class civilization of the ancient regime , and rendered prudish also by its ad - herence to classical models , had its decorum soon shocked by too coarse intermixture of the grotesque .

		The vaunted superiority of French taste could not accommodate itself to ' ignoble ' exaggeration .

		The first half of the nineteenth century is looked upon as a period of individ - ualism -- the one-man power in caricature .

		In
America	LOCATION	the political cartoon , which practically began with
William Charles	PERSON	's parodies upon
Gillray	PERSON	, developed in a fitful and spasmodic fashion until about the middle of the century .

		The establishment of '
Puck	PERSON	' and ' Judge ' led to a distinct advance in political caricature ; it also made it possible to draw an intelligent comparison between the tendencies of caricature in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		It was not until
Thomas Nast	PERSON	began his pictorial campaign against the ring which held
New York	LOCATION	in its clutch , that American caricature could claim a pencil which entitled it to particular considera - tion from the artistic point of view .

		While the impulse to satirize public men in pictures is probably as old as satiric verse , the political cartoon , as an effective agent in moulding pub - lic opinion , is essentially a product of modem conditions and methods .

		The history of a hun - dred years of caricature , extending over all countries , is a subject which , if attempted at all in a single volume , could only be done in the form of a compact and well-reasoned essay .

		The entertaining and fragmentary sketches of the present historians are desultory but agreeable attempts to mirror the ' immeasurable laughter * of nations ; and they are to be commended for the historical accuracy of the text and for the skill shown in the selection of illustrations .

		Bright sides of American life and character .

		Just as the sailor is said to have brought back from his circumnavigation of the globe , as his chief intellectual attainment , a knowledge of the liquor served in seaports , so Sir
Philip Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Bart.	LOCATION	, brought back from his resi -

		No Aphrodite ever rose from the wave to more suc - cessful contemplation from the eyes of lovers of beauty than ' my beautiful snow-white tub , with its silver fittings and perennial supply of hot water and cold . '

		This , with the telephone , and the electric light ` that gives light , ' are the .

		three things that life in
England	LOCATION	itself fails to reconcile our author to , once he has known them on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	's hither shore .

		But it must not be supposed that these are all , but rather the prima inter pares .

		Truly , an aver - age struck between this book and that of Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	would not give an incorrect view of
America	LOCATION	; we never were as bad as the English gentlewoman made us out , and it is to be feared we never can be as good as the English baronet says we are .

		From the astonishment with which Sir Philip perceived that the poorer classes of Americans are clean in their appearance , it may be judged that the British of the same social rank are not , -- in spite of the criticism passed some years ago upon the personal habits of the South African burgher .

		But no blame is to be attached to the traveller .

		He was given every opportunity to see the best side of American life , and he certainly did not stay here long enough to catch the American characteristics , as his numerous sketchies , used as illustrations , attest ; one and all , they are merely pictures of English folk in an exotic environment .

		Such adverse criticisms as the book holds are of un - important matters from our own point of view : things like crowded street-cars , the soot of Chi - cago , and yellow journalism .

		Of the realities of American life , excepting the rapidly growing luxury among the rich , there is no record , nor does there pretend to be .

Putnam	LOCATION	-- it is still to be said that he finds no indications of strength anywhere in the empire of the Czar , but everywhere signs of such weakness as , persisted in , must inevitably drag it and its rulers down to destruction .

		ISTor can the impression be easily avoided that the ancient prejudice of the German against the Slav is speaking , and speaking loudly , from beginning to end of the work -- allowing at the same time no doubt of the author 's intention to be fair .

		In one respect , at least , the statements of the book are not verified ; the financiers of the world , as shown by the rate at which the recent war-loan of
Russia	LOCATION	was negotiated , do not believe that the government is near the end of its resources , as Mr.
von Schierbrand	PERSON	avers , and have shown it in the most convincing and practical manner .

		The whole question here turns upon the official statistics put forth from time to time by the
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	ministry .

		These , the author states , are confusing , irreg - ular , incomplete , belated , and , as he believes , deliberately misleading .

		Yet upon them , of necessity , his entire argument is leased ; and this may be summarized as the depletion and almost wicked exhaustion of the empire at home for the sake of gratifying imperial ambitions in farther
Asia	LOCATION	.

		He proves , by a skilful use of the dilatory census reports , that the peasant of old
Russia	LOCATION	is growing poorer and poorer through the exactions of tax-gatherers , unwise commu - nal laws , and witliholding of education of every kind , until to-day he stands with his lands in too small sections to be worked to advantage , his soil decreasing in fertility , his domestic animals few and growing fewer , and himself always on the edge of famine .

		Money taken from him , as from the dwellers in the cities of
European Russia	LOCATION	, is spent extravagantly and corruptly in the new ^ wssessions of
Asia	LOCATION	; and this cause , coupled with the collapse of
M. de Witte	ORGANIZATION	's plans for the creation of great manufacturing inter - ests , leaves the imperial structure undermined in its foundations .

		It is to be inferred from this work that the success of the Japanese is inevitable , and the author says with deliberation that nothing better could ■ possibly befall tlie Russian people if they are to go on to real suc - cess as a nation .

		With all due appreciation of the spirit in which Professor
Shaler	PERSON	wrote , and with due respect for the inherent value of his work , it must be set down as unscientific , both in its material and in the manner of its presen - tation .

		If the book is meant to be an abstract of a vast philosophic question , too much space is given to the s -RSB- iecific instances of the Jews and the Negroes without such a correlation as shall bind the parts into a single whole .

		If the
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 author 's idea was to furnish a backgrouud for the treatment of two interesting racial problems , his setting forth of each is merely skimming the surface af the matters involved .

		There is noth - ing that Professor
Shaler	PERSON	has said concerning the American African that has not been said better by the two race-leaders in their books on the subject , and nothing in his study of the Je ` wnsh question to compare with
M. Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	's masterly work ,
' Israel Among the Nations	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The tremendous paradoxes that puz - zle every student of this latter question , Pro- fessor
Shaler	PERSON	cpiite ignores .

		The obtrusive Jew he knows , and treats him in many resjjects with more kindness than he deserves ; this is the Jew who doubles your greeting , who ' climbs all over you ' in his endeavor to make his way in the world , whose mental activity appals the slower Aryan mind , and who in all these resj ^ ects -LRB- this fact Professor
Shaler	PERSON	evidently does not recog - nize -RRB- stamps himself , not by his Judaism , but by the tyj ^ ical vices of the parvenu .

		But what • of the exclusive Jew , the silent , religious , rigid man whom the Christian world does not know unless it seeks him , as
M. Beaulieu	PERSON	did ; the Jew who bars his doors against us when we but close ours to him , who considers his race and his blood too pure for admixture with ours , who seeks no converts because he is too clannish and too vain of his clan to welcome an outsider , who is a Russian in
Russia	LOCATION	, a Spaniard in
Spain	LOCATION	, an American in
America	LOCATION	, and yet , through the power of some unaccountable vital principle , a Jew in every land .

		This man the author of ' The Xeighlwr ' evidently docs not know .

		From his professor 's chair he has studied the races that stand forth most prominently in the American world about him ; from his own large sympathies he judges ; but it requires more than human sympathy to account for human sympathies , and Professor
Shaler	PERSON	leaves the conditions of human contact still unex - plained .

		Dreams of the betterment of humanity .

		So far as Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	has a method `` in his ' Mankind in the Making ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , it seems to consist in asking questions at consider - able length , and admitting them to be unan - swerable at even greater length .

		The theme is the betterment and regeneration , physical , in - tellectual , and spiritual , of humanity , -- which it will be granted , is almost as inclusive a topic as humanity is likely to find for discussion within the limits of its history .

		In spite of the practical admission that existing problems are insoluble through anything less fundamental than the march of evolution , the book is cheer - ful almost to the point of hilarity .

		Beginning with the possibility of securing artificial selec - tion through the mating of men and women on Scottish traits depicted ty a Scotchman .

		other grounds than those they find to-day , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	confesses that improvement in this re - spect is fairly inconceivable , and that any inter - ference would in all likelihood result in failure .

		The remaining part of the book is given over to problems of education and government .

		Neither a collectivist nor an individualist , the author endeavors to steer a middle course be - tween these extremes .

		Somewhat naturally , the course of the argument is like that between Scylla and Charybdis , and neither socialist nor anarchist will admit that the author escapes shipwreck .

		But the book will appeal to many and varied interests .

		It is brightly and sharply critical of the world as it is , and none too con - fident about what it will Ix ^ come .

		It has a point of view which , if not stable , is all the more capable of seeing life as it is , and as it might be , at many angles .

		It is always stimu - lating to thought , even when least to be agreed with ; and it abounds in suggestions that may lead to valuable experiments .

		It is a sort O ' f sequel to the author 's ' Anticipations ' of two years ago , and is like it in many respects ; and this means that it is much more readable than many sounder books will ever be .

		Not so ` unspeakable ' as Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	's
Scot	PERSON	are the Scotch characters depicted in Sir
Archibald Geikie	PERSON	's ' Scottish Reminiscences ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Though the book resembles in character such collections as
Ramsey	ORGANIZATION	's '
Remi	PERSON	- niscences ' and
Cockburn	PERSON	's ' Memorials , ' the eminent geologist has apparently been very suc - cessful in excluding ancient anecdotes .

		In a happy descriptive and anecdotal style , he sets down what he himself has seen and heard in his professional travels over all parts of
Scotland	LOCATION	and the neighboring islands .

		Without induc - ing paroxysms of mirth , some of his stories are uncommonly good -- as that of the wealthy iron - master who , wishing to furnish his mansion with a library befitting his station , and being asked by the dealer who was to provide the ' leebrary ' whether he would have his books bound in
Russia	LOCATION	or
Morocco	LOCATION	, replied in amaze - ment , ' Can ye no get them bund in
Glasco	PERSON	' ? '

		New to most readers will be the reference to a custom prevailing , or that once prevailed , among the poorest crofters .

		The author speaks of their being obliged to bleed their cattle and mix the blood with their meagre supply of oat - meal in order to sustain life through unusually hard winters .

		This reminds one of the still crueller practice of like nature not uncommon among savage tribes .

		That the Scotch are gifted with humor , despite
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's opinion to the contrary , is proved by its unexpected dis - play even amid scenes of woe .

		But perhaps the followincr is rather an instance of a defective 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, than of a redundant sense of the incongruous : ' An old couple were exceedingly annoyed that they had not been invited to the funeral of one of their friends .

		At last the good wife consoled her husband thus : ''
Aweel	PERSON	, never you mind ,
Tammas	LOCATION	, maybe we 'll be haein ' a corp o ' our ain before lang , and we 'll no ask them . ' ''

		Anecdotes of
Whittier	LOCATION	and his region .

		Mr.
Samuel T. Pickard	PERSON	,
Whit	PERSON	- tier 's biographer and intimate friend , has given in '
Whittier	LOCATION	- Land ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a view of the poet too little familiar to most of his readers .

		After an anecdotal sketch of the
Merrimac	LOCATION	- Eiver region associated with the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	bard , Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	adds a chapter on '
Whittier	LOCATION	's Sense of Humor , ' illustrated by quotations in both prose and verse .

		The poet 's chuckle , we are told , was visible rather than audible .

		He would double up with laughter , and yet utter no sound .

		This mirthful temperament , so little suspected by most of us , had its beneficial effect in prolonging the life of the far from robust poet .

		So at least thinks Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	, who well says : ' An earnest man without a sense of humor is a machine without a lubricant , worn out before its work is done . '

		Here is a story illustrating
Whittier	LOCATION	's quiet drollery , and short enough to quote in the author 's words : ' An aged
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	friend from
England	LOCATION	, himself a bachelor , was once visiting Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, and was shown to his room by the poet , when the hour for retiring came .

		Soon after , he was heard calling to his host in an excited tone , '' Thee has made a mistake , friend
Whittier	LOCATION	; there are female garments in my room ! ''

		Whit - tier replied soothingly , '' Thee had better go to bed ,
Josiah	PERSON	; the female garments wo n't hurt thee . '' '

		A score or more of
Whittier	LOCATION	's uncol - lected poems are contained in the book , which is also fully and attractively illustrated from photographs .

		It is an admirable guide and com - panion to the tourist in Whittier-Land .

		The legends and ^ ^ ^
Charles G. Harper	PERSON	's vol - landmarks of the u m c o n ' The Ingoldsby ingoidsby Country .

		Country ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will appeal to several classes of readers .

		Its avowed purpose is to trace the landmarks of ' The In - goldsby Legends , ' a book which , with its author , is probably unknown to the majority of readers of this generation .

		While nine out of ten people may not know who Ingoldsby was , yet , like
Izaak Walton	PERSON	, he is likely always to have a little circle of devoted friends who will not suffer his name to fall into oblivion .

		The
Eeverend Richard Harris Barham	PERSON	, known to his readers as
Thomas Ingoldsby	PERSON	, seems to have been a very likable person .

		The same simplicity and kindliness and humor that en - deared him to his acquaintances have won for him , for more than half a century , the affection of those who knew him only through the legends .

		Belonging as they do to no particular - period , they will never be out of date ; and , far from growing smaller , their audience is per - haps larger now than on their first appearance .

		Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's book will be welcomed by the - readers of these famous legends , but it has also an interest apart from this .

		The county of Kent has traces of the Roman ,
Briton	LOCATION	,
Dane	PERSON	,
Saxon	LOCATION	, and
Norman	PERSON	; it is a region abounding in historic and antiquarian remains , and Mr.
Harper	PERSON	has done a valuable work in collect - ing the traditions of this richly storied local - ity .

		The tourist , on the watch for out-of-the - way and as yet unspoiled spots , will delight in the revelation made here of some retired and quaint little nooks apart from the ordinary course of travel .

		It is rather a pity that they should be thus betrayed to the world , for they will not be likely to remain long unmolested .

		The numerous illustrations made by the author add greatly to the charm of the present work .

		In these days of the photograph , it is a pleas - ure to encounter the old-fashioned woodcuts again .


Charles Reade	PERSON	as playwright .

		Mr.
John Coleman	PERSON	, the well - known theatre-manager , pro- lific writer on matters theat - rical , and voluminous author of novels of a cer - tain grade , presents '
Charles Reade	PERSON	as I Knew Him ' -LRB- Button -RRB- in a volume of rather formid - able bulk , but rendered attractive by numerous illustrations .

		Reade is here portrayed chiefly in his character of playwright .

		That his first and abiding love was play - writing , will surprise most readers of his novels .

		Twenty-five acted and ten unacted plays stand to his credit , his dramas thus exceeding in number his works of narrative fiction .

		It is significant that , by his ^ desire , the inscription on his tomb described him .

		as ' dramatist , novelist , journalist . '

		As Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	's prefatory note gives warning of the character of his book , one must not censure too severely its rambling incoherence and careless - ness of literary form .

		But he need not have made his hero so extremely colloquial in his conversation .

		` Fella , ' ` fellas , ' ' fellaship , ' ` leetle , ' ` Maudlen ' -LRB- the college -RRB- , -- by these - eccentricities of spelling in reporting the utter - ances of our excellent
Charles Reade	PERSON	-LRB-
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	graduate , successively fellow , dean , and vice - president of
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	, and scholarly and ac - complished author of ` The Cloister and tlie Hearth ' -RRB- Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	gives us something of a shock .

		The book , after all , is better suited to those interested in the gossip of the stage than to admirers of Reade the novelist , of whom , , unfortunately , no satisfactory biography ha * yet appeared .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 The spirit of ■ Greek Sculpture .

		If one should wish to turn for a time from things modem and be steeped in the spirit of ■
Greece	LOCATION	, he might well read Mr.
Edmund	PERSON	von
Mach	ORGANIZATION	's book on '
Greek Sculpture	ORGANIZATION	, its Spirit and Principles ' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Scholarly , sincere , and full of suggestion , it makes an appealing plea to its readers for the cultivation of the love of Greek art .

		The work is no mere guide - book , mechanically cataloguing the various prod - ucts of the Greeks ' artistic activity , but is , rather , an appreciation of their point of view and a suggestion as to its bearing on Art and Life .

		Incidentally , the reader , assisted by plates and clear descriptions , gains a considerable knowledge of the sculptures themselves ; and if he he familiar with the work of other authors on the subject , he will note that Mr.
von Mach	PERSON	has by no means bound himself to conventional interpretations .

		Were it not for the careful logic with which the author has followed up his assertions , one might doubt , at times , the valid - ity of his position .

		But the strength , the force , the unity which are shown in the work make one feel that what Mr.
von Mach	PERSON	states as fact is authoritative , and his conclusions are well worth consideration .

		BRIEFER MENTION . '

		The
Langham Series of Art Monographs	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by Mr.
Selwyn Brinton	PERSON	and imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is introduced to our notice with a volume on
Auguste Rodin	PERSON	, by Mr.
Rudolf Dircks	PERSON	, and one on ' The Illustrators of Mont - martre , ' by Mr.
Frank L. Emanuel	PERSON	.

		The books are well illustrated and prettily bound in limp red leather , and on the whole should have no diflBculty in holding their own in competition with the numerous other series of the same sort now appear - ing .

		A ' New Century History of the
United States	LOCATION	' for the use of schools was the last literary work undertaken by the late
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	.

		He had nearly completed the work at the time of his death , and what it still needed in the way of sup - plement and revision has since been done by his brother , Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	, the work being now published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The narrative is of excellent literary quality , the illus - trations are many and interesting , and the teach - ing apparatus is skilfully planned .

		The plays of
Vanbrugh	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
A. E. H. Swain	PERSON	, form the latest reissue in the ' Mermaid Series , ' imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The same importers also send us
Defoe	PERSON	's ' Journal of the Plague Year , ' in the '
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	Pocket Classics , ' and five new volumes of the '
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	Thin Paper Classics ' -- ' The Ingoldsby Legends , ' ' Poems by

		A Contribution to the

Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Every few years , Mr.
Henry Abbey	PERSON	revises his Poems , adding some and omitting others .

		The present edition is the fourth , contains nine new pieces , and is published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The Book of the Carnation , ' by Mr.
R. P. Brotherston	PERSON	, is the latest addition to Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's ' Handbooks of Practical Gardening . '

		A spe - cial chapter on raising new carnations is contrib - uted by Mr.
Martin R. Smith	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hector Macpherson	PERSON	has condensed into a volume of moderate dimensions the greatest of all economic classics --
Adam Smith	PERSON	's ' Wealth of Nations . '

		The historical matter is generally omit - ted , while the theoretical passages are as generally preserved .

		Messrs ,
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The interest in Dr.
Robert F. Harper	PERSON	's presenta - tion of ' The Code of
Hammurabi	PERSON	' has made neces - sary a second edition of the work , and this will be published shortly by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		A supplementary volume , entitled ' The
Hammurabi	PERSON	and the Mosaic Codes , ' is announced as in preparation . '

		A Greek Grammar , Accidence and Syntax , for Schools and Colleges , ' by Mr.
John Thompson	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The object of the work is ' to introduce into schools some knowledge of modern comparative philology as applied to Greek . '

		It is a bulky volume of nearly five hundred pages .

		An accurate text of
Baron de Tocqueville	ORGANIZATION	's ' L'Ancien Regime ' is about to be issued by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor is Mr.
G. W. Headlam	PERSON	, who has written a short introduction explaining de Tocqueville 's position among scien - tific historians , together with a few notes of a more or less elementary kind . '

		The Book of School and College Sports , ' pre - pared with various editorial assistance by Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	, is a book that will certainly find a large constituency among youthful athletes .

		The subjects are football , baseball , track and field athletics , lacrosse , ice hockey , and lawn tennis .

		The Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	are the publishers .

		Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	has just finished a new volume of short stories , which will be published this fall by Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the title , ' Traffics and Discoverifes . '

		This is the first volume of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's collected tales since ' The Day 's Work . '

		It contains one long tale , ' The Army of a Dream , ' hitherto unpublished .

		Carlyle 's '
Cromwell	PERSON	, ' in three volumes , appears from the press of the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		This is a handsome library edition , to which the editor , Mr.
S. C. Lomas	PERSON	, has brought the equipment of the most exacting scholarship for the furnishing of the elaborate apparatus of notes .

		The work is also provided with a lengthy introduction by Mr.
C. H. Firth	PERSON	.

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-

Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	: a True Life , ' by Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	; ' Historical and Biographical Narratives , ' by Miss

Orison Swett Marden	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edward Berdoe	PERSON	, author of a '
Browning Cyclopaedia	PERSON	, ' now publishes through
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a useful little ' Primer of
Browning	PERSON	, ' indicating concisely the subjects and outlines of the various poems .

		An appendix contains the poew .

		entitled ' A Miniature , ' recently discovered and attributed to
Browning	PERSON	, but since proved to be from another hand .

		To the '
Temple Series of Bible Characters	ORGANIZATION	and Scripture Handbooks , ' published by the J. B. Lip - pincott
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the following three volumes have just been added : ` The Age of
Daniel	PERSON	and the Exile , ' by the Rev.
A. Mitchell Hunter	PERSON	; `
Saul	PERSON	and the
Hebrew Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	, ' by the Rev.
Robert Sinker	PERSON	, and ' The Early Christian Martyrs and Their Persecu - tions , ' by the Rev.
J. Herkless	PERSON	.

		The dainty '
Garden Diary	PERSON	and
Calendar of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, ' published by Messrs.
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, should prove a companionable book for amateur gardeners .

		In addition to a poetical quotation and blank space for individual entry for every day in the year , there are practical gardening directions for each month contributed by Miss
Rose Kingsley	PERSON	, and a brief introduction by Mr.
George A. B. Dewar	PERSON	.

		M.
Pierre de Courbertin	PERSON	's useful little annual , ' La Chronique de
France	LOCATION	, ' with its accompanying '
Carnot Bibliographique	PERSON	, ' makes its fourth appear - ance with the volume for
1903	DATE	.

		Among the sub - jects discussed are the Renan statue , the excava - tions at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, the
Combes	PERSON	educational crusade ,
French Louisiana	LOCATION	, and ' L'Evolution des Genres Litteraires ' as illustrated by recent publications in verse and prose .

		The Hawthorne Centenary celebration began at the
Bowdoin College Commencement	ORGANIZATION	on
June 22	DATE	, when Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, editor of ' The Atlantic Monthly , ' delivered the oration .

		Anniversary exer - cises were also held at
Salem	LOCATION	,
June 23	DATE	, when Dr.
Samuel M. Crothers	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	was the prin - cipal speaker .

		On the actual date of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's birthday ,
July 4	DATE	, literary exercises will be held at
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's '
Wayside	PERSON	' home in
Concord	LOCATION	.

		Lovers of elegiac poetry have to thank Miss
Mary Lloyd	PERSON	for a most careful selection of ' Ele - gies , Ancient and Modern ' -LRB-
Albert Brandt	PERSON	, Tren - ton , N. J. -RRB- , prefaced with a scholarly ` history of elegiac poetry from the earliest days down to the present time . '

		The opening selection , twenty-four lines from the ' Rig Veda , ' indicates to what remote antiquity
Miss Lloyd	LOCATION	has pushed her stud - ies .

		The closing piece in the first volume -LRB- a sec - ond is to appear later -RRB- brings us down to Con - greve .

		A little discordant in appearance , but in that only , is Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's prose rendering of ' The Lament of Bion , ' all the other translations being in verse .

		That the elegies are not all tearful is proved by the inclusion of
Milton	LOCATION	's lines on
Hobson	PERSON	-LRB- of '
Hobson	PERSON	's choice ' -RRB- .

		The ' Addresses and Presidential Messages of
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, 1902-1904 , ' with an introduc - tion by
Senator Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, is a recent publication of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The volume purports to be only a selection , yet the addresses alone num - ber thirty-nine -- perhaps we may venture to call them the thirty-nine articles of the Republican faith as held in this year of grace by the official head of the party .

		They deal with pretty nearly all subjects , and were originally delivered pretty nearly everywhere , from
Bangor	LOCATION	to
Palo Alto	LOCATION	, and from
Charleston	LOCATION	to
Spokane	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's swing around the circle makes
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	's seem but a small affair .

		And this is not all , for the volume also contains twenty pages of letters , auvl nearly two hundred more of presidential messages .

		Mr. Lodge finds ' genuine sincerity ' to be the note of these deliverances .

		We open the book at ran - dom , and the first words that strike our eye are these : ' I do not intend to appoint any unfit man to office . '

		But even as severe a moralist as Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	would find it difficult to vouch for the ' fit - ness ' -LRB- in any other than a Pickwickian sense -RRB- of some appointments that will occur to the mind of every reader .

		THE growing interest in marriage and divorce legislation throughout the country , and the determined efforts put forth in the various denominations to make the marriage relation permanent , when once it is entered into , have provoked a great deal of discussion of the family and its place in our modern social organization .

		SUMMER READING , so-called , must be absorbing enough to take THE reader along WITHOUT THE LEAST CONSCIOUS EFFORT , AND NOTHING ACHIEVES THIS RESULT BETTER THAN BOOKS OF DRAMATIC EXCITEMENT OR OF DELIGHTFUL HUMOR .

		HERE ARE SOME PERFECT EXAMPLES OF BOTH CLASSES .

		WHEN WILDERNESS WAS KING So successfully has Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	woven a beautiful lov6 story around the dramatic struggle for
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	that his book is now listed among `` the six best sellers . ''

		There is no doubt about its ability to keep the reader 's interest -- to the exclusion of all his surroundings .

		Besides , its ornamental features and illustrations make it attractive to have around .

		McCUTCHEONS `` CARTOONS '' The volume published last year , '' Cartoons by
McCutcheon	PERSON	, '' is of the variety known as * ' hardy perennial '' because its humor is the sort that is just as delightful one year as another , and will repay any number of re-readings .

		This year 's volume -- `` Bird Center Cartoons '' -- seems in a fair way to become a classic .

		Not to be familiar with the
Bird Center	ORGANIZATION	characters is now con - sidered almost as reprehensible as not knowing one 's
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		THE WARD OF KING CANUTE and THE THRALL OF LEIF THE LUCKY Anyone who has not read these two wonderful Viking romances by
Miss Liljencrantz	PERSON	has a most .

		delightful pleasure to anticipate .

		They .

		are so fresh .

		and vigorous , so full of the fjre and splrrt_a # l - ^ the Norsemen , that they stand in a class by themselves in modern fiction . ''

		They can be unhes - itatingly recommended to those who appreciate the elusive flavor of true romance , nor must their beautiful illustrations be overlooked .

		In the
summer of 1304	DATE	, the e.xiled
Ghibel	PERSON	- lines , including in their number the greatest of Italian poets , made their headquarters in the Tuscan town of
Arezzo	LOCATION	, whence they vainly sought to effect a return to their l -RRB- eloved Flor - ence , which had cast them forth Adth con - tumely .

		One of these exiles , exijelled from
Florence	LOCATION	` on the same day with
Dante	ORGANIZATION	some - thing more than two years earlier , was a scholar and politician of some consequence named Pe - tracco ; and to him there was born , on the
30th of July	DATE	, the child destined to a fame among Italian poets second only to that of his father 's friend and fellow-exile .

		The i ^ ersonal relations which thus link the names of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and Pe - trarch did not , however , operate to shape the two poets in anything like the same mould ; and the chief instruction offered by setting them side by side is found in the marked contrast between their temperament , their outlook , and their ideals .

		The main point of contrast is , of course , to be found in the fact that
Dante	PERSON	was the incarnation of the medijeval spirit , while
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	had in some dim sense the vision of the world to come ' and all the wonder that should be ' ; the thoughts and the emotions of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	were held in the sttait - jacket of scho - lasticism , while those of Petrarch were work - ing themselves free from that hampering con - finement ; while
Dante	PERSON	's ideal of the future took the Utopian form of the universal dual monar - chy of Papacy and Empire , the words of Pe - trarch , declaring that ' ` L'antico valore Neir italici cor non e ` aneor morto , ' made his voice the first of those to be raised in prophecy of the very practical ideal of a united
Italy	LOCATION	.

		In a word , the teniijer of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, for all ills deep tenderness and spiritual exaltation , was that of the schoolman ; that of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , for all the mistaken direc - tion of his aims , was that of the humanist .

		It has recently been suggested , in a semi - humorous way , that American contributions toward the erection of a monument iat
Arezzo	LOCATION	might most appropriately Ix ; made by such of our fellow-countrymen as had ventured to prac - tice the art of sonnet-writing .

		Certainly , if all of those thus designated should respond to the appeal , al -RRB- imdant means would be forthcom - ing , no matter how nuMlest the individual offer - ings .

		The sonnets of Petrarch have had a mul - titudinous -RSB- > rogeny , not all of whom liave done credit to their progenitor , and many a modern 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, maiden has been the recipient of a form of trib - ute which might never have been thought of had it not been for the sonnets addressed to
Madonna Laura	ORGANIZATION	six hundred years ago .

		The Canzoniere of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, that ` epitomised en - cyclopaedia of passion , ' as Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	calls it , is so precious a jewel among the world 's poet - ical possessions that it predisposes us t-o a kindly indulgence of the feeblest of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's modern - followers .

		The `
Africa	LOCATION	' upon which the poet set his hopes of enduring fame has gone the way of all artificial epics , and of all mediaeval attempts to keep Latin alive as the medium of literary expression ; but the odes , and the son - nets , and the trionfi , written in the despised vulgar tongue , have taken on with the succeed - ing centuries a more assured immortality .

		Of the influence of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	upon the poetry of later ages , something is said in the special arti - cle which we print elsewhere ; we wish to devote our own brief remarks to the liumanist rather than to the poet , to the forerunner of the re - vival of learning rather than to the singer oi his own joys and sorrows .

		The Alpinists claim
Petrarch	PERSON	as the first of their number by virtue of his famous ascent of
Mont Yentoux	PERSON	.

		We doubt , however , if they can read with proper sympathy the letter in which the expedition is described .

		The mod - em mountain-climber is not likely to sit down in the first convenient valley and say to himself , ' What thou hast repeatedly experienced to-day in the ascent of this mountain , happens to thee , as to many , in the journey toward the blessed life , ' and then to indulge in a long retrospec - tive survey of his career .

		Nor is he apt , after having reached his summit , to take St.
Augus	PERSON	- tine 's ' Confessions ' from his pocket and ponder over its message .

		In
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's case the effect was startling , for he hit upon the following pas - sage : ' And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains , and the mighty waves of the sea , and the wide sweep of rivers , and the circuit of the ocean , and the revolution of the stars , but themselves they consider not . '

		Whereupon , he says : ' I was abashed , and ... closed the book , angry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might long ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful but the soul , which , when great itself , finds nothing great outside itself . '

		From that mo - ment , the panorama of hill-tops and clouds and skies meant no more to him than the view of
Lake Leman	PERSON	had meant to
Bernard of Clair	ORGANIZATION	- vaux . '

		Then , in truth , I was satisfied that 1 had seen enough of the mountain .

		I turned my inward eye upon myself , and from that time not a syllable fell from my lips until we reached the bottom again . '

		But Petrarch eoiild hardly have been ex - pected to climb his mountain in the modem spirit ; the significant thing is that he did such a thing at all . '

		My only motive was the wish to see what so great an elevation had to offer , ' is his simple prefatory statement .

		But we , knowing in how many things his thought groped imconsciously toward the future , may be pardoned for finding this exploit in a cer - tain sense symbolical , or at least highly suggest - ive of wliat we can now see to have been his relations to the development of culture .

		He cherished the past , -- none more fondly than he , -- but he never took the view that the sum of all possible culture had been made up by the ancients , leaving nothing for the coming ages to add .

		He knew not what those ages might bring forth ; but he had a wistful sense of their possibilities , which amounted almost to pre - science .

		The analysis of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's humanism reveals a number of distinct elements .

		He not only climbed the mountain , but he also travelled fai and wide , because he was genuinely curious about the world of nature and of men , and took a wholesome interest in things and affairs .

		He read the classical authors , not to find in them texts for disputation , but for the purposes of culture as we understand the term , and with a passionate enthusiasm for their beauty .

		He col - lected a library of some two hundred manuscript volumes , not for the reputation of owning them , but because they were for him the very bread and wine of the intellectual life .

		He even planned to bequeath his books to
Venice	LOCATION	for the general good , thus conceiving the modem idea of the public library .

		He wrote the most delightful letters to his friends , following the example of Pliny and
Cicero	PERSON	, and he wrote them with an eye to their preservation for future generations .

		He even wrote a fragmentary autobiography ; and , what is particularly noteworthy , he made it largely a record of his inner life , of his intel - lectual and emotional experiences .

		The course of his speculation was singularly self-deter - mined ; he rejected the narrow educational ideals of his age , and made free to find flaws in the teaching of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, -- not , indeed , calling him ' that accursed heathen , ' as Luther was to do two centuries later , but flatly refusing to recognize his authority as pontifical .

		All these matters , as well as others unmen - tioned , bring Petrarch into closer touch with the modern world than any of his contempora - ries .

		Carducci makes him the intellectual ar - biter of his age , as
Erasmus	PERSON	and
Voltaire	PERSON	were the intellectual arbiters of theii-s ; but that strictly historical fact appeals to us less directly than the fresh and sympathetic quality of his work .

		Tliose who would like to come into close contact with
Petrarch	PERSON	the humanist , as distin - guished from Petrarch the poet , will do well
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 to read the volume of selections admirably translated and edited by Professors Eobinson and Eolfe , The English reader could have no better introduction than this to the man and his writings .

		The poems , of course , need no such introduction .

		There have been over four hundred editions of them in Italian alone , besides countless translations into numerous tongues .

		And of their author , now in his grave six hundred years less the three score and ten of his life , let our closing words be those of the contemporary who thus described his end : '
Francesco Petrarca	PERSON	, the mirror of our century , after completing a vast array of vol - umes , on reaching his seventy-first year closed his last day in his library .

		He was found lean - ing over a book as if sleeping , so that his death was not at first suspected by his household . '

		MODERN ECHOES OF
PETRARCH	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each century brings new proof of the perma - nence of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's influence and the charm of his poetry .

		As
Italy	LOCATION	celebrates , on the
20th of July	DATE	, the six-hundredth anniversary of his birth , she challenges the world to name a literary hero who has won more sympathetic homage from cultured men and women of every age .

		Research during the last century has disclosed few new facts in
Petrarch	LOCATION	's life ; but knowledge of his work , both as humanist and poet , has been widely disseminated .

		Earlier studies , by
Abbe de Sade	ORGANIZATION	,
Foscolo	PERSON	,
Ginguene	PERSON	, and
Sismondi	PERSON	, have been trans - lated and appreciated .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	many biographic and critical treatises have appeared ; there have also been a few significant volumes by English and American scholars , from the biog - raphy by the poet
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	in
1843	DATE	to more re - cent studies by Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	, Mr.
Reeve	PERSON	, and the collaborated work of Professors
James Harvey Robinson	PERSON	and
H. W. Rolfe	PERSON	.

		Other popular sketches , both in book and magazine form , have testified to the increasing interest in the romantic phases of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		More illuminative , both of the man and the poet , have been the translations of his sonnets , canzone , and letters , by such modern scholars as
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	,
Walter Savage Landor	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Gamett	PERSON	, and
Colonel T. W. Higginson	PERSON	.

		Indirect evidences of his literary influence abound .

		The Victorian poets and their successors made frequent allusions to him , and their works bear impress of his mode and spirit .

		No one would claim
Petrarch	PERSON	as one of the world 's greatest poets .

		But the duration of his popularity , and the acknowledged and indirect imitations of his style , give evidence of the pro- gressive quality of his influence .

		As the lover and sonneteer of
Laura	LOCATION	, as the patriot-friend of
Rienzi	PERSON	and
Colonna	PERSON	, as the enthusiast for pure classicism in an age of mental lethargy and pedantry , he merits the remembrance which has never waned from his day to our own .

		Without loss of his prestige as a scholar , he has won more general recognition as an amatory lyrist , com - bining the best elements of chivalrous worship for women with the conflicting passions of a modem lover .

		In the more than three hundred sonnets , and the scores of canzone and sestinas , celebrat - ing the charms and reserve of his mistress , pho - tographing the lover 's struggles of heart and con - science ,
Petrarch	PERSON	has accomplished a work of poetic art more memorable than his cultural re - forms .

		There is an ever-new fascination in his revelations of this fourteenth-century woman ^ with her soft dark eyes , her golden hair , her alluring voice , and her reposeful beauty of face and presence .

		Midway between the spiritual
Beatrice	PERSON	and the sensual Fiametta , she is a hu - manized creation of rare charm .

		Whether she was in truth , as later authorities aver , the wife of
Hugo de Sade	PERSON	and the mother of nine children , or only the personification of a poet 's vision , she is essentially real yet ideal , -- the mistress of feudal days , Avith the dominant traits of modern womanhood of a loftier type arousing in her lover 's heart a conflict between reverence and yearning .

		While the last century has given attention chiefly to the love-poetry of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, it has not overlooked his qualities as a leader both in affairs and in letters .

		His Latin essays in available form for the modern scholar , his voluminous cor - respondence carefully edited and largely trans - lated , afford distinct signs of the directive force which he wielded in his OAvn age .

		Undoubtedly the time was ripe for his influence ; but such consideration does not minimize his service .

		In ^ ferior to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	as a poet , and separated from him by less than a generation , he was eminently modern in spirit and mode , while
Dante	PERSON	was the last noble exponent of mediaevalism .

		With all his breadth of insight ,
Petrarch	PERSON	was more than a scholar and a poet ; he was the first true Italian patriot-prophet .

		With vanity and a proneness to servility , he possessed deep-rooted aspirations for political reform , in which are found many of the later tenets of patriotism .

		In his diplomatic mis - sions , in consultation with Pope and Doge , even in his ardent hope and disappointment in
Rienzi	LOCATION	,
Petrarch	PERSON	was an idealist tempered by practical wisdom .

		Like
Mazzini	PERSON	, his great compatriot of five hundred years later ,
Petrarch	PERSON	saw in his vision a free and united
Italy	LOCATION	, though it was his belief that this should come through a revival of Roman standards .

		For
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, whose father had suffered exile from
Florence	LOCATION	, there was no specific city-allegiance ; he was a patriot , not a partisan , well called by Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	* a freeman of the City of the Spirit . '

		Passages in his letters reveal the hidden ethical motives of the man .

		His honesty , his hatred of deceit in any form , are often reiterated .

		In the confession of his unabating passion for work , he seems strangely akin to our modern day .

		The wish expressed to
Boccaccio	PERSON	, that death might find him reading or writing , was fulfilled with un - expected literalness .

		From the letters covering the period between

		Modern scholarship has not only found new meanings in
Petrarch	LOCATION	, but it has shown greater • discrimination in the study of his literary forms , iieigh Hunt 's ' Book of the Sonnet / in the midr ■ die of the nineteenth century , emphasized for English readers the perfection of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's verse and its many adaptations .

		To Mrs.

		To
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	we are indebted for one of the most musical transla - tions of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's * Ode to
Vaucluse	LOCATION	. '

		Hunt caught the playful spirit of the verse , and deli - cately portrayed the vision of
Laura	LOCATION	amid a shower of blossoms .

		Passing by occasional trib - utes to Petrarch in prose and verse , by
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	,
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	,
Lord Houghton	LOCATION	, Lord 3H -LSB- amner , and other English scholars , one is re - ` minded of the more significant allusions by that ■ coterie of poets to whom
Italy	LOCATION	was not alone a : goal of pilgrimage but a place of long and happy • sojourn .

		In
1813	DATE	,
Byron	PERSON	, in disgust at his own inability in sonnet form , had written : ' They are ithe most puling , petrifying , stupidly platonic • compositions .

		I detest the Petrarch so much that i would not be the man even to have obtained his Laura , which the metaphysical , whining dotard never could . '

		In '
Don Juan	PERSON	' he interpolated a • characteristic sneei ' , -- ' Think you if
Laura	PERSON	had been
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's wife , He would have written sonnets all his life ? ''

		`` When , however , chance brought
Byron	PERSON	to the ^ uganean hills , he found himself moved to a tnore sympathetic note toward
Petrarch	PERSON	and his adjacent home .

		In a somewhat skeptical mood , `` tie paid his first visit to
Arqua	LOCATION	in
1817	DATE	.

		He con - fessed that he was ' moved to turn aside in a second visit , ' and
two years later	DATE	he urged the poet
Moore	PERSON	' to spare a day or two to go with ine to
Arqua	LOCATION	; I should like to visit that tomb with you , -- a pair of poetical pilgrims , -- eh ,
Tom	PERSON	, what say you ? '

		All are familiar with his ^ commemoration of ' the soft , quiet hamlet at `` Vaucluse ' in ` Childe
Harold	PERSON	' -LRB- IV : xxx -RRB- .

		Shelley had been under the spell of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's influence before he came to
Italy	LOCATION	, when , in
1813	DATE	, lie joined his friend
Hogg	PERSON	, and read the Italian poets in company with Mrs.
Boinville	PERSON	and her ■ sentimental daughter
Cornelia Turner	PERSON	.

		Shelley 's learlier interest was revived under these close ^ associations , and in his * Defense of Poetry ' he spoke warmly of Petrai-ch , ' whose verses are as spells which unseal the inmost enchanted foun - tains of the delight which is in the grief of love .

		It is impossible to feel them without becoming a portion of that beauty which we contemplate . '

		Vaucluse became a pilgrim-shrine to the
Brown	PERSON	- ings , from that first romantic scene pictured by Mrs.
Jamieson	PERSON	, as well as by Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, when the poet-lovers * sate upon two stones in the midst of the fountain which in its dark prison of rocks flashes and roars and testifies to the memory of Petrarch . '

		In their Italian studies , the
Brownings	ORGANIZATION	found
Dante	PERSON	and Camoens more stimulating than
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, though one recalls sig - nificant references to the latter in * Apparent Failure , ' ' The Ring and the Book , ' and * The Vision of Poets , ' such as , ' And Petrarch pale , From whose brain-lighted heart were thrown A thousand thoughts beneath the sun .

		Each lucid with the name of One . '

		For the most pronounced reflection of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's influence , one turns to Landor .

		At the outset , he challenges all English writers who have transformed his hero 's name . '

		For I pretend to no vernacular familiarity with a person of his distinction , and should almost be as ready to abbreviate
Francesco	PERSON	into Frank as
Petrarca	LOCATION	into Petrarch . '

		The idea of ' The Pentameron ' may be traced to the letter sent by
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	to
Boc	ORGANIZATION	- caccio after the latter had given him a copy of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and asked for a more sympathetic reading of the earlier master .

		That
Petrarch	PERSON	recognized the mental superiority of Dante can not be ques - tioned ; but he confessed that he was repelled by two causes , -- the severe adherence to med - iaeval standards , and a persistent memory of one glance , when he was eight years old , at the cold and rigorous face of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two other reasons for this indifference are suggested in
Landor	LOCATION	's dialogue : first ,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's youthful fear lest by reading Dante he should become a mere imitator ; and , second , an objection to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's persistent use of the Italian rather than the Latin text for his lofty poetic vision .

		The na - tures of these great poets were too antithetical to be in accord , -- leaving out all suggestions of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's vanity ; and Landor has well de - lineated what Disraeli called ' Petrarch 's caus - tic smile on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	. '

		To Landor , the character of Petrarch was thus unfolded : ' Unsuspicious , generous , ardent in study , in liberty , in love , with a self-complacency which in less men woidd be vanity , but arising in him from the general ad - miration of a noble presence , from his place in the interior of a heart which no other could ap - proach or merit , and from the homage of all who held the principalities of Learning in every part of
Europe	LOCATION	. '

		The early studies and translations of Pe - trarch 's sonnets by
Lord Morley	PERSON	,
Major Mac	ORGANIZATION	-
Gregor	PERSON	,
Lord Surrey	LOCATION	,
Lady Dacre	PERSON	, and
Susan Wollaston	PERSON	, are still valuable to the modern reader .

		During the last three decades , several volumes of translations and anthologies have ex - tended general study of the Petrarchan sonnet , -- notably the anthologies by
Samuel Waddington	PERSON	,
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31
William Sharp	PERSON	, Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, and the scientific treatise on the sonnet by Mr.
Charles Tomlinson	PERSON	.

		In his recent volume of sonnets from
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, and Camoens , Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	has shown skill and poetic insight in his renderings of more than sixty Petrarchan sonnets .


Espe	PERSON	- cially fine are the thirty-ninth , with the poet 's benediction upon
Laura	LOCATION	; the eightieth , on Vau - cluse ; and the second of the later memorial son - nets after the passing of
Laura	PERSON	and his friend
Colonna	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	has prefaced the transla - tions by an original sonnet of tribute , closely fol - lowing his model in structure and effective play upon the words
Laura	PERSON	and Laurel : ' Laurel In right of Laura thou didst claim , Which wreath Apollo with his bay enwound ; Nature with flower and wit with diamond crowned ; Thine were the wind , the dawn , the star , the flame . '

		Of American translators , none have rendered more scholarly and sympathetic sonnets by
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	and Camoens than
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	.

		Some of these were included in his earlier volume of verse , ' The Afternoon Landscape ' ; and with them have been incorporated a few new trans - lations in the exquisite volume of this memorial year , ' Fifteen Sonnets of Petrarch . '

		Here also is reproduced the essay published in * The At - lantic ' many years ago , * Sunshine and Pe - trarch , ' in which the earlier sonnets were im - bedded .

		The elusive memory of
Laura	LOCATION	's beauty , and the vacuity of mind after her death , have been retold with perfect sympathy in sonnet 251 , * Gli occhi di eh ' io parlai . ' '

		Dead is the source of all my amorous strain .

		Dry is the channel of my thoughts outworn .

		And my sad heart can sound but notes of pain . '

		Deft in portrayal of the lighter fancies .

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	has been even more successful in the deeper revelations of the spirit .

		With earnest grace he has interpreted the three hundred and twenty-third sonnet , the exaltation of
Laura	LOCATION	's womanliness and its admonition to maidenhood of all ages , -- ' Qual donna atende a gloriosa fama . ' '

		Doth any maiden seek the glorious fame Of chastity , of strength , of courtesy ?

		Gaze in the eyes of that sweet enemy Whom all the world doth as my lady name !

		How honor grows and pure devotion 's flame , How truth is joined with graceful dignity .

		There thou may ` st learn , and what the path may be To that high heaven which doth her spirit claim ; There learn that speech beyond all poet 's skill .

		And sacred silence , and those holy ways Unutterable , untold by human heart .

		But the infinite beauty that all eyes doth fill .

		This none can learn ; because its lovely rays Are given by God 's pure grace , and not by art .

		* Though Petrarch 's sonnets and songs can never be placed in the very first rank among world - poetry , yet there is an unwaning charm in the life and verse of this man of warm passion , of strenuous ambition for himself and the modern world .

		Refreshing the mind of his own age with draughts from the
spring	DATE	of classic letters , he speaks a message as pertinent to-day as when it issued from his romantic valley retreat , or was listened to by his flatterers at the Venetian court .

		* Personalities will continue to interest more than impersonalities , as long as human nature endures .

		The concrete is to most of us so much easier of apprehension than the abstract , that memoirs and reminiscences and -LRB- alas , that it should be so ! -RRB-

		court scandals and back - stairs gossip are eagerly perused , while works on psychology and sociology and the history of institutions go begging for readers .

		This be - ing the case , and any immediate change for the better being beyond the book-reviewer 's power to effect , he ought at least to single out , for that commendation which is implied in an ex - tended notice of the present kind , only such examples of personal history and anecdote as are most nearly free from malevolence , from frivolous tattle , and from petty detail of what - ever sort .

		In this more worthy and dignified class of biographic and autobiographic writing belongs Sir
Mountstuart E. Grant Duff	PERSON	's vo - luminous but seldom unentertaining ` Diary , ' some fresh '' Notes ' from which , covering the years 1893-95 , have recently appeared in two volumes convenient in size and appropriate in character for
summer	DATE	reading .

		With two more volumes the diarist hopes to bring his work down to the accession of the present King , thus covering a full half-century .

		In the instal - ment now published , as in the earlier ones , the author has , he tells us , ' resolutely kept to the less serious side of life , ' and he purposes doing so to the end .

		A few notes from these ` Notes , ' with such occasional comments as they may suggest , will perhaps suffice to introduce the book to the reader .

		No one was readier than
Wordsworth	PERSON	him - self to admit his lack of humor ; and , when we come to think of it , this is no slight evidence of the poet 's candor and self-knowledge .

		Yet
Browning	PERSON	held that
Wordsworth	PERSON	did himself an injustice in this matter ; for , according to the younger poet 's report , when his engagement to
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	was announced Words - worth exclaimed , ` Well !

		I suppose they un - derstand each other , although nobody under - stands them . '

		Strictly speaking , this should rather be classed as wit than as humor , being the discovery of an unexpected congruity , not the revelation of an unimagined and comical incongruity .

		32 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, ed joke .

		On being asked , a few days before his death , whether he had had a comfortable night , he replied , ' Yes !

		I had a very pleas - ant dream , I dreamt that there would be in future thirty-nine Muses and only nine Ar - ticles . '

		A curious incident , ominous if we choose so to regard it , is related on the authority of an eye-witness .

		At the coronation of
Charles X.	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	, the crown slipped and was caught by the
Duke of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	before it reached the ground .

		Another anecdote of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	will be new to most readers .

		Ambassador Bay - ard told our diarist that the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, in the days of his first exile , ' found his way to
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia and started a business , chiefly in molasses , under the firm of '' Orleans and Brother . ''

		It was unsuccessful , and the future
King	PERSON	became a teacher of French in the family of Mr.
Bay	PERSON	- ar 'd 's great-grandfather .

		He wished to marry one of the daughters , and a miniature of her from his hand is now in the possession of Mrs.
John Field	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	. '

		This great-grandfather , we infer , was Dr.
James Asheton Bayard	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, who died prematurely in
1770	DATE	, twenty-five years or more before the incidents referred to .

		To another of our countrymen there is devoted a paragraph that probably makes unduly prominent certain of his less amiable traits which have been noted by pre - vious writers . '

		Our talk strayed to
Lowell	LOCATION	, so agreeable at his best , so much the reverse when , as too often , he bored his company by trying to prove that all men of ability had Jewish blood , or when that secret distrust of himself and his countrymen , which was his bane , overmastered his better nature and made him offensively self-assertive .

		Aberdare quoted some instances of this , but also his excellent advice to a young lady about to be married , which I have elsewhere noted : `` Always give your husband -- your way . '' '

		When it comes to self-assertion , the English are well able to hold their own .

		This charge against
Lowell	PERSON	recalls the greedy youngster who taunted his sister for taking the very piece of cake he had set his heart on .

		The author gives a list of highly interesting letters and papers examined by him at the Eec - ord
Office	ORGANIZATION	, -- among others the despatch con - taining an account of the battle of
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	, signed by
Marlborough	LOCATION	himself but written in another hand , a circumstance for which he apologizes in a postscript , saying that he was out of order for want of rest .

		In our day , when important communications are dictated to stenographer and typewriter , one would rather expect an apology for an autograph des - patch .

		How unconscious do we tend to be - come of the large part played by convention in all our customs !

		Livingstone reported the ex - istence in central
Africa	LOCATION	of a tribe whose wom - en were greatly disgusted when he told them that in
England	LOCATION	it is customary for a man to have but one wife ; and
Lubbock	LOCATION	tells of an in - telligent Kandyan chief who was ` perfectly scandalised at the utter barbarism of living with only one wife , and never parting until sepfirated by death . '

		But this is a digression , though not an unpardonable one , it is hoped .

		An improved version of an old story is thus given by our diarist : ' Most people have heard the story of the late Archbishop of
Dublin	LOCATION	exclaiming at a dinner - party in his deep voice : '' It 's come at last !

		it 's come at last ! ''

		His horrified wife , springing up , asked : `` What has come ? ''

		`` Paralysis , '' replied her lord . ''

		Paralysis ! ''

		she rejoined . ''

		What can make you think that ? ''

		`` I have been pinching my leg from time to time , '' was the answer , '' for the last two minutes , and I can feel nothing . '' ''

		I beg your
Grace	ORGANIZATION	's pardon , '' said the lady who sat next to him , '' you have been pinching mine . ''

		Miss Yonge told this , but made the recipient of the pinches -- an Archdeacon ! '

		This anecdote , despite its mild flavor of im - propriety , is here quoted to offset another that has been marred rather than mended in the telling by our author .

		It is that story of a French misprint which
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	gives in his * Autobiography ' ; and as his is an earlier and hence presumably a more authentic ver - sion , and as readers of light memoirs are not , in many cases at any rate , readers of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, it may be worth while to record here the better form of the anecdote .

		Spencer had it from
Louis Blanc	PERSON	not quite half a century ago .

		In a novel by a certain Comtesse X -LRB- Spencer withholds the lady 's name -RRB- the nov - elist , wishing to point the moral of her tale in its closing sentence , had written , ' Bien connai - tre I ` amour il faut sortir de soi . '

		The printer made of this , ' Bien connaitre I ` amour il faut sortir le soir . '

		Some schoolboy answers to examination ques - tions are given on the authority of the exam - iner or other responsible person .

		Two of these ingenious stupidities are worth quoting .

		Ques - tion : ' Enumerate the principle battles between
Marston Moor	ORGANIZATION	and
Naseby	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Answer : ' General
Marston Moor	PERSON	and
General Naseby	ORGANIZATION	repeatedly encountered each other ; but at last
General Naseby	ORGANIZATION	defeated his opponent in a great bat - tle , and
Marston Moor	PERSON	was left dead upon the field . '

		Question : ` Explain Lupercalia . '

		An - swer : ' Lupercalia was the name of the she - wolf who nursed Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	. '

		Finally , let us note the witty or otherwise memorable dying utterances of sundry celebrat - ed men , as jotted down here and there in the
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL .

		33 Diary - .

		On the authority of one who sat beside
Disraeli	PERSON	's death-bed , we learn that when the doctor , with finger on pulse , felt justified in declaring , ' I think the old gentleman is gone at last , ' the indomitable Beaconsfield made an - swer , ' Not yet . '


Horace Smith	PERSON	, -- presumably the
Horace Smith	PERSON	of the ' Rejected Addresses , ' -- was asked , as he lay dying , whether he would have any more ice . '

		No , ' he replied , ' no more ice for me , -- except paradise . '

		This reminds the diarist of the last words attributed to Ra - belais as he drew his cowl over his face , -- ' Mo - riamur in domino . '

		There have been given here but a few out of the many readable matters that fall so read - ily from the author 's practised pen .

		He has both the story-hearing and the story-telling temperament .

		Few men , or women either , join his company without being made to give of their best for his amusement or instruction ; and by this praiseworthy characteristic of his the reader is the gainer .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The
Duel	ORGANIZATION	, of Sex .

		* Just
six years ago	DATE	, a writer in this journal , lured by the fascination of *
Candida	PERSON	, ' was tempted to say that he almost regretted that the poet in the play was not lame , or some - thing of the sort , so that it might have been acted .

		When this regret was expressed , ' Can - dida ' had , I believe , already been put on a few times in
England	LOCATION	by Mr.
J. T. Grein	PERSON	's ' In - dependent Theatre , ' in a propagandist tour through the provinces with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's ' A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	. '

		It evoked little comment , however ; and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's disappointment was all the greater when
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, who had al - ready put the play in rehearsal in
America	LOCATION	, was compelled to abandon it , owing to the physical difficulties of impersonating the eighteen-year - old pre-Raphaelite poet .

		While '
Candida	PERSON	' had been played several times in the English provinces , it had never been seen in
London	LOCATION	, except for a representa - tion by the
Stage Society	ORGANIZATION	, until
April 26	DATE	of the present year , when the first of seven afternoon performances of this play was presented at the Court Theatre .

		The press notices were very inadequate and misleading , which prompted Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	's recent reproof of the English critics for their failure to report what happened at these performances , -- namely , that everyone was highly interested , amused , and edified .

		Except for a performance by th e
Browning	PERSON	• Man and Superman .

New York	LOCATION	:

		Society of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	last year , and one other performance by amateurs , '
Candida	PERSON	' had not been seen in
America	LOCATION	until
December 8	DATE	last , when Mr.
Arnold Daly	PERSON	and his company gave their first matinee performance in
JSTew York	LOCATION	.

		It was soon transferred to the evening bill , and more than a hundred and fifty consecutive per - formances were given in that city alone .

		On
April 23	DATE	, the company went on the road , and duplicated , in
Boston	LOCATION	and elsewhere , the
New York	LOCATION	success .

		^ The Man of Destiny , ' a one - act piece by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, was also added to Mr.
Daly	PERSON	's repertory .

		The appearance of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's new play , ' Man and Superman , ' just now is especially timely .

		The '
Candida	PERSON	' performances in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	not only pleased their immediate audiences , but have given wide pub - licity to Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's claims as a dramatist , espe - cially as a dramatist who has expressed the con - fident belief that the public had brains and wanted to think .

		The new book will make a considerable demand upon the brains of the public , and in order to understand it they will have to think , whether they want to or not .

		The modem three-act play , which makes up only a little over a third of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's new book , was written at the suggestion of Mr.
A. B. Walkley	PERSON	, dramatic critic of the `
London Times	ORGANIZATION	, ' a friend and former fellow-worker with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	in the field of criticism .

		So the new volume is dedicated to Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	in a lengthy ` Epistle Dedicatory , ' which gives the philosophic rationale of its evolution and con - struction .

		Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	wished his friend to write a
Don Juan	PERSON	play , and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has chosen to interpret
Don Juan	PERSON	's character in the modem philosophic sense .

		The
Don Juan	PERSON	, invented early in the sixteenth century by a Spanish monk , thrown upon the stage by Mo - liere , interpreted spiritually by
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	, and in - adequately represented in
Byron	LOCATION	's fragment , has long since become an obsolete type .

		Even
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's
Faust	PERSON	, the spiritual cousin of
Don Juan	PERSON	, although he had passed far beyond mere love-making into altruism and humanitarian - ism , was still almost a century out of date .

		Moreover , the modem society play , in which the woman defies the law regulating the relation of the sexes , land the man marries her in de - fiance of the convention which discountenances the woman , did not suit Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's purpose any better because , even though preoccupied with sex , it is really void of all sexual interest .

		The
Don Juan	PERSON	of tradition and drama and op - era being antedated , the modern so-called sex - drama debarred , and the play of mere libertin - ism excluded for obvious reasons , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	was driven to the conclusion that
Don Juan	PERSON	in the philosophic sense was his only alternative .

		34 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, The reductio ad absurdum process forced him to present the modem type of
Don Juan	PERSON	, who * does actually read
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and
Nietz	PERSON	- sche , studies
Westermarck	PERSON	, and is concerned for the future of the race instead of for the free - dom of his own instincts / But when Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	was confronted with the problem of the duel of sex , he solved it with the typically Shawesque conclusion that Man is no longer , like
Don Juan	PERSON	, the victor in that duel .

		Woman has become not only powerful , but even aggressive and dangerous .

		She cov - ertly takes the initiative in the selection of her mate .


Don Juan	PERSON	is transformed from pursuer into pursued .

		Thus the new play is , in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's words , ' a stage projection of the tragi - comic love chase of the man by the woman . '


Ann Whitefield	PERSON	, a modern English girl , se - cures the appointment of the friend of her childhood ,
John Tanner	PERSON	, as one of her guar - dians , by her father 's will , in the hope of using the relation as a lever for her intrigues to win him .


John Tanner	PERSON	, alias
Don Juan de Tenorio	PERSON	, a pen-picture of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	himself , perfectly fulfils the definition of the philosophic
Don Juan	PERSON	.

		His chauffeur , `
Enry Straker	PERSON	, alias Le - porello , first opens his eyes to the machinations of
Ann	PERSON	.

		But this
Ann	PERSON	is no Merely
Mary Ann	PERSON	, and
Tanner	PERSON	, seeing that his only safety is in flight , takes wings -- otherwise his automobile -- and speeds to
Granada	LOCATION	, Unhampered by the proverbial ^ scrupulous - ness ' of woman , -- that is , with total disregard of masculine fastidiousness , --
Ann	PERSON	, in com - pany with a party of her friends , starts in pur - suit .

		Although
Tanner	PERSON	declares to her , when they meet , that he will not marry her , that he was appointed her guardian , not her suitor , that marriage to him means loss of freedom and in - dividuality , his declarations go for naught .

		For he is at last in the grip of the
Life Force	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ann 's will has conquered his , for the motive-power of her will is that
Life Force	ORGANIZATION	, the genuine sex - ual instinct that brooks no denial or defeat .

		Goethe recognized the existence of an eternal womanly principle in the imiverse .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has now written a play to show that Woman leads Man onward and upward -- ^ .

		hy the nose .

		He has stripped things bare of their amoristic halo , and brought us face to face with the stark problem of sex .

		One of his strongest convic - tions was expressed years ago in these words : ' To me the tragedy and comedy of life lie in the consequences , sometimes terrible , sometimes ludicrous , of our persistent attempts to found our institiitions on the ideals suggested to our imaginations by our half-satisfied passions , instead of on a genuinely scientific natural his - tory . '

		In the new play he has chosen to sub - rait his own view of the existing relations of men and women , in the most highly civilized society , for what it is worth .

		He has dealt with love , not from the idealistic side of ^ romantic nonsense , erotic ecstacy , or the stern asceticism of satiety , ' but from the observational and em - piric standpoint of pure science in physics .

		The new play , which throws into the familiar order of cause and effect a certain body of fact and experience , may possibly interest the public ; but it is more probable , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	believes , that it will pass at a considerable height over its ` simple , romantic head . '

		Daring more and more to be a realist as time passed , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has now taken the last step .

		With amazing boldness , he has finally laid hands on a mask , which the idealists have always feared to lose and fought to retain .

		One other thing is of sufficient interest to note .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has complained of many dram - atists , the moidems especially , on account of their failure to realize in character the impres - sion they seek to produce .

		You arp told that someone is a great politician , a great architect , a great financier ; but there is nothing especial - ly definitive about the character to support and enforce that ah extra estimate .

		Dissatisfied with such a feeble evasion , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has not only stated that his hero wrote a revolutionist 's handbook , -- he has given the handbook in full at the end of the play .

		Unwilling also to de - prive his friend
Walkley	PERSON	of the pleasure of an - other glimpse of the ' Mozartian dissoluto puni - to and his antagonist the statue , ' he has inserted in his modem play a totally extraneous act in which the Mozartian
Don Juan	PERSON	, in a '
Shavio	PERSON	- Socratic dialogue , ' philosophizes at great length with the lady , the statue , and the devil .

		The discussion of philosophy and sociology , with which the superflous act and the revolutionist 's handbook almost wholly deal , is left for a phil - osophic socialist of the most pronounced

		The play of ideas , the drama of edification , is the ideal Mr.

		THE DIAL 35 The
Moorish Empire	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		* In the earlier centuries of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, it seemed as if the end of all civilization had come .

		Tribes and nations numbering thou - sands , perhaps hundreds of thousands , of bar - barous men were wandering hither and thither through the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lands in quest of suitable homes .

		The story of the Germanic migrations is well known ; few subjects in his - tory have been studied with greater patience and care .

		We are , however , likely to forget that all the nations that migrated in those days were not Germanic .

		Two or three years after the
Lombards	LOCATION	had entered
Italy	LOCATION	, there was bom in a distant Arabian city the great Mohammed whose followers in due time came to demand their share of European soil .

		It seems that no earlier scholar has attempted to write in English anything like a detailed account of the Moorish empire in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Prescott and
Irving	PERSON	, among others , have writ - ten entertainingly of the last days of Saracen in ` dependence ; but theirs is not the picture of a nation in the fullness of conquering power , -- they tell the story of a dying race .

		Eecently , however , an American student , Mr.
S. P. Scott	PERSON	, has undertaken to present the entire history of this interesting people .

		* This work has engaged the attention of the author for more than twenty years .

		Its object is an attempt to depict the civilization of that great race whose achievements in science , literature and the arts have been the inspiration of the marvellous progress of the present age . '

		The work is in three large volumes of about seven hundred pages each .

		In the first volume the author traces the history of the Moors down to the middle of the eighth century .

		The Arabic home ,
Mohammed	PERSON	, the rise of Islam and its conquering progress from
Pamir	LOCATION	to the
Atlas	LOCATION	region , are the subjects of the first few chap - ters .

		A chapter is devoted to the Visigothic monarchy in
Spain	LOCATION	, and then follows the account of
Tarik	PERSON	's invasion in 711 , the estab - lishment of the emirate , and the beginnings , of the new Christian state in the ravines and gorges of
Asturia	LOCATION	.

		The history of the emirate during the forty-five years of its existence is told quite circumstantially , perhaps unneces - sarily so .

		The second half of the volume tells the story of the
Khalifate of Cordova	ORGANIZATION	from the coming of the first Ommeyade in 756 to the end of the dynasty in
1012	DATE	.

		Under the Khalifs ,
Saracen Spain	PERSON	reached the meridian of her prosperity and glory .

		But in the eleventh cen - tury disaster befell the
Ommeyades	LOCATION	; the last survivor of the royal line mysteriously disap - peared , and the empire collapsed .

		The second * The History of the
Moorish Empire	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		By
S. P. Scott	PERSON	.

		In three volumes .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Llppincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		volume continues the history of the fragments ^ closing with the conquest of
Granada	LOCATION	in
1492	DATE	.

		The civilizing infiuence of the Moorish peo - ple is the principal theme of volume III .

		In glowing terms the author recounts the wonder - ful achievements of the Arabic mind .

		* From Moorish sources ... were derived those - maxims of chivalry which modified the turbu - lent barbarism of feudal
Europe	LOCATION	, the courteous gallantry of the tournament , idolatrous devo - tion to the female character , a high sense of honor and personal dignity , and the refining ^ amenities of social life .

		From these originals - sprang the germ of modem literature and the earliest models of modem poetry .

		Through the schools of Montpellier and
Saler	PERSON	- no , contemporaneous seats of learning and both dominated by Arabian influence , the philosophy of Averroes , the botany of Ibn-Bei - thar , the surgery of Abulcasis , the agriculture of Ibn-al-Awam , the histories of Ibn-al-Kha - tib , became familiar to the benighted and priest - ridden people of
Europe	LOCATION	. '

		All this , and much more , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	claims for the Moors as an educative influence in the
West	LOCATION	.

		At the same tim , e he tries to minimize the effects of the Cru - sades as a factor in European civilization .

		In many respects this volume is the most valuable part of Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's work .

		Modern civilization is , indeed , a composite product to which the learning and experience of Arabic
Spain	LOCATION	have largely contributed , though perhaps not so extensively as our author would have us believe For an undertaking such as this , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	seems to be eminently qualified .

		To an evident knowledge of the Eomance and Oriental lan - guages , he adds an intimate acquaintance with the region where the
Saracen	PERSON	empire flourished .

		He sympathizes with the Arab race ; he under - stands the Arab spirit ; he appreciates the literature of the desert ; he knows the precepts of Islam .

		From one who can bring to his task such thorough scholarship and such genuine enthusiasm we should expect a masterpiece .

		These qualities alone , however , do not make the historian .

		That the author has made a thor - ough study of his subject can not be doubted .

		The annalistic field of the Middle Ages is largely barren soil ; and yet Mr.
Scott	PERSON	has been able to collect a great mass of interesting mate - rials .

		But the manner in which these materials are built up into a historical narrative is open to serious criticism .

		His work is clearly intended to be what is commonly called a popular history ; as it has no foot-notes and is very poorly indexed , it will prove something of a disappointment to the scholar who may try to use it .

		In matters of chronology it is also seriously wanting .

		From the dates given at the head of each chapter , the reader may know - approximately when the recorded event 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, occurred , but only occasionally does the text furnish an exact date .

		One needs not be a critic to discover that the work is far too extensive .

		This is due in part to the author 's diffused style , and in part to his habit of commenting freely on almost every subject discussed .

		He has also included a great many things that a conscientious historian would omit .

		Mere suspicions and exploded myths should not be given a place on a page devoted to serious history .

		Nor is it necessary for a historian to express an opinion on every conceivable subject that may be drawn into the narrative .

		In chapter XXVII .

		the author turns aside from his general purpose to give his readers a little insight into the conditions of
Christian Europe	LOCATION	during the Middle Ages .

		This is , of course , done for the purpose of con - trast ; but the treataient of the matter is as unfair as it is admittedly superficial .

		The whole chapter , with large sections of other chap - ters , should have been omitted as unnecessary and irrelevant materials .

		Almost every page of Mr.
Scotf	PERSON	s work is in need of literary com - pression .

		By removing superfluous padding the three volumes could easily be reduced to two , and appreciation of what seems to be a solid and valuable piece of work would be greatly increased therebv .

		choose to write .

		Now , after all these years , he reverts to the method , and even to the plan , of his first successful book , and gives us in ' The Veil of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	' a ripened dramatic discus - sion of the fundamental problems of belief .

		Again we have the country-house and its urbane host , again we have the guests and the daily symposia which give them occasion to set forth their respective points of view , and again we have the thinly-disguised personalities of cer - tain well-known thinkers .

		And it may be added that we have again the amusing by-play , the touches of humanity , the covert satire , and the erotic suggestiveness that gave the earlier work a spice and savor of its own .

		The case of
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	, who in ' The New Republic ' brought confusion to the good Dr ,
Jenkinson	PERSON	by asking if Greek love-poems were very hard to translate , finds a pendant in ' The Veil of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	' when Lord Restormel breaks off abruptly his paraphrase of the Song of Songs by saying , ' I did n't get any farther than that . '

		To which Lady
Snowdon	PERSON	replies : * And I 'm sure it was a very good thing you did n't . '

		These diversions , however , are infrequent , and the temper of the whole work is far more serious than that of its predecessor .

		For this reason , and for its failure to bag so interestingly con - trasted a collection of personalities as rewarded the sport of ' The New Republic , ' the new book fails to eclipse the old one , and is greatly its inferior in piquancy , animation and deft satiri - cal humor .

		It shows , nevertheless , the same diabolical cleverness of intellectual mimicry , and has of course the advantage of dealing with the phases of religious thought presented to our own time as distinguished from those most evi - dent a full generation ago .

		Of actual person - alities , only two , -- those of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	and Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, -- are obviously recognimble to the world at large ; the others may be described , -- as the Philistine material - ist , the Hegelian idealist , and the sensuous dilettante , -- instead of having definite names affixed to them .

		In his portrayal of the syn - thetic philosopher and the positivist , and of the several clerical types introduced , Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	verges more than once upon caricature , and indulges in spiteful flings of the sort with which readers of ' The New Republic ' are suffi - ciently familiar .

		The seasoned reader of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's many writings knows that his chief delight is in pulling the strings that make his puppets work , and that the showman himself never ventures into the open .

		Rupert
Glan	PERSON	- ville , the host of the present company , clearly speaks for the author , and all that he can do in the end by way of extricating us from the philosophical tangle takes the form of a weak resort to something like

		THE DIAL 8T to adopt any basic set of ideas , or to meet with any sort of logic the logic of his opponents .

		We expected nothing more than this , and con - sequently can not urge the disappointment that will doubtless be felt by many readers of the present work .

		This lack of conviction on the part of the author of course reduces the whole book to a kind of ingenious dialectic exercise , and prevents it from being considered a serious contribution to thought .

		But for all that , it is vastly entertaining and even stimulating to the thoughtful mind , and will at least serve to arouse the dullest reader from his sluggishness .

		This is the only apology we have to offer for directing attention to it in a review of current fiction , for it is only by an extraordinary exten - sion of the meaning of the term that we may regard the book as being fiction at all .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's first essay in fiction takes the form of a whimsical romance of
London	LOCATION	in the twenty-first century .

		Externally , the metropolis is described as not greatly differing in appearance from the present , but in spirit the years have brought a vast change .

		The les - son of social evolution has been learned and taken to heart ; men no longer try to make changes by violence , and democracy has ceased to be a passionate faith with any considerable number of people .

		Life has grown apathetic and mechanical , and the king is chosen by lot .

		Just at the time when the story opens , chance has selected for monarch a certain dry humorist by the name of
Auberon Quin	PERSON	.

		Casting about for the wherewithal of a sensation , this person - age devises a plan for the restoration of the ancient autonomy of the cities of which
London	LOCATION	is the coalescence , and for the revival , at the same time , of all the pomp and ceremony and gorgeous trappings of mediaevalism .

		The plan goes into effect , and soon has an unforeseen consequence .

		A young fanatic named
Adam Wayne	PERSON	, who becomes Provost of Notting Hill , takes the thing seriously , and , when certain men of affairs seek to open a new thoroughfare through his territory , resists by force of arms , repulses the invaders by ingenious strategy that depends mainly upon control of the gas-works and the water supply , and thus firmly estab - lishes himself in the position of dictator .

		Aroused by his example , the other cities begin to take seriously the new mediaevalism , and pres - ently we have a transformed
London	LOCATION	, no longer a civic unity , but a congeries of rival municipalities under the hegemony of Not - ting Hill .

		The king , meanwhile , surprised at the consequences of his whim , watches the new developments with amused curiosity and sar - donic interest .

		In the end -LRB- of the story -RRB- , many years later , Notting Hill is attacked by a league of the foes raised up by
Wayne	PERSON	's arrogant dic - tatorship , and this time successfully invaded and crushed .

		But the idea for which it stood is not vanquished , since
London	LOCATION	has been per - manently transformed into a centre of vivid and picturesquely romantic life .

		Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton has developed this invention with an admir - ably humorous philosophy , and found in it the opportunity for a renewed exercise of his peculiar talent for startling paradox .

		` Eomance , ' which is a big new book by Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, written with the collaboration of Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	, takes us from
England	LOCATION	to the haunts of the Cuban bucca - neers , and gives us a striking series of pictures set in that lawless environment .

		The time is only a hundred years ago , too late for an exhibi - tion of the full fiower of pirate enterprise , yet not sufficiently modern to plunge us into the age of humdrum respectability .

		We call the book a series of pictures , for such it is rather than a coherent and skilfully-planned romance .

		The pictures are satisfactorily vivid , the situa - tions have strong dramatic quality , and the fig - ures are drawn with the power of characteriza - tion that we have learned to expect from Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's genius .

		Certainly in respect to both characterization and diction , the hand is Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's ; the hand of his fellow-craftsman is probably to be found in the working-out of the plot and in the swing of the narrative .

		The book as a whole is rather disappointing , despite its many remarkable qualities .

		But although it does not satisfy as a piece of construction , youthful readers will find their account in its panorama of breathless adventure , while the older and more discriminating will be well rewarded by its brilliant style and wealth of incisive detail .

		Mr.
Quillor-Couch	PERSON	's ' Fort Amity ' is a his - torical romance of the French and Indian war , leading up to the victory of
Quebec	LOCATION	, although that crowning achievement is glimpsed rather than described , and reached by indirection rather than by the novelist 's straightforward attack .

		The hero is a young English officer who is captured at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, and thus cut off from participating in the deed of his com - panions-at-arms .

		His captivity throws him among Indians and Frenchmen , and even after he escapes from his bonds , he remains in their companionship , allured in part by the charms of wild forest life , and in part by the even more potent charms of one
Madamoiselle Diane	PERSON	, a daughter of the foe .

		All of these complica - tions bring us to a properly romantic conclu - sion , but the residual impression of the story is vague and disappointing .

		Welcome indeed , and all the more welcome because of its unheralded coming , is the new novel of the genial Dutchman who calls him - self '
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	' for literary purposes .

		This author is not of those who have their 38
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	& , doings chronicled from day to day , and who resort to the puff preliminary and other devices known to the advertising novelist ; he is the sort of man who works without observation until a new masterpiece is completely shaped , and then bestows it without trumpeting upon the world .

		The new novel is called '
Dorothea	PERSON	: A Story of the Pure in Heart / and is indeed a masterpiece .

		It is fairly upon the level of ' God 's Fool ' and ' The Greater Glory / which amounts to saying that it is a work that few living writers of English fiction could hope to equal , and possibly none surpass .

		To sketch the story in outline would be so ineffectual a way of conveying an impresBion of its beauty and strength that we shall not make the attempt , beyond saying that it tells of a half - Dutch half-English maiden , whose girlhood , secluded from all evil thoughts , is passed in rural
Holland	LOCATION	, and who is suddenly transported into the world -- the world of fashion and folly and wretchedness as .

		it may be seen in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The story itself , although strictly private in its interest , is skil - fully contrived , and has enough of plot to hold the attention .

		But the real charm of the book is to be sought in its vital delineation of a great variety of characters , its many-colored portrayal of life , and the unfailing tenderness and purity of its idealism .

		It is a book to take to one 's heart , a book to make one grateful to the author for writing it , a book that makes the world better for its existence .

		A sharper contrast could not easily be found than is offered when we set ' The Woman With the Fan ' by the side of the work just reviewed .

		We are introduced by both novels to the same general sort of sophisticated society , but the writers view their subject from opposite sides , and the optimistic human outlook of '
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	' is replaced by the hard and unlovely cynicism of Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	.

		The latter writer , Indeed , has already taught us what to expect from him .

		He takes a mean view of life , and its morbid aspects are to him typical manifesta - tions of human character .

		He has an epigram - nuatic manner which gives a certain superficial clevemess to his work , but which in the long run proves distressful .

		This latest novel of his depicts a woman of fashion , her jealous and brutal husband , and her various lovers .

		Be - coming disfigured by an accident , she drinks the very dregs of bitterness as her lovers faU from her one by one ; for the author 's thesis seems to be that physical beauty is everything in a woman , and that men 's protestations of their love for her intellectual or spiritual quali - ties are mere hollowness or self-delusions '' The book is hopelessly lacking in naturalness and in anything like elevation of sentiment .

		It leaves a bad taste not easily to be forgotten .

		Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's new novel gives us a picturesque panorama of the movement of westward expansion that began when the first hardy pioneers crossed the mountains in pre - Bevolutionary times , occupying not without dif - ficulty the dark and bloody ground of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and that was consummated a generation later by the raising of the
United States	LOCATION	flag over the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Territory .

		It introduces us inci - dentally to
Boone	PERSON	and his fellow-fighters , makes much of
Clark	PERSON	's conquest of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, car - ries us through the period of Western disaffec - tion marked by intrigues with
Spain	LOCATION	and the brief history of the
State of Franklin	ORGANIZATION	, and leads us in the end to the secret transfer of
Louisiana	LOCATION	from
Spain	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	, and the final obliteration of European control over the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and its Western shores .

		Here is matter enough and to spare for the outfitting of a historical romance , and Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has skilfully brought it all into a sort of unity by linking it with the for - tunes of his imaginary hero . '

		The Crossing ' is the fitting title of this narrative , for all of its episodes follow logically enough from the crossing of the Alleghanies by those first haxdy pioneers .

		The historical figures presented to us include
Boone	PERSON	,
Sevier	LOCATION	,
Robertson	PERSON	,
Wilkinson	PERSON	,
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, and , foremost among them ,
George Eogers Clark	PERSON	.

		Upon his delineation of that stout-hearted and daring Virginian Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has expended his best powers , follow - ing the ' Memoirs ' quite Literally , yet drawing with their aid a portrait of fine artistic quality .

		We have both the
Clark	PERSON	of the
Cahokia	LOCATION	and
Vincennes	LOCATION	expeditions , resourceful , command - ing , a natural leader of men , and the
Clark	PERSON	of later years , embittered by his treatment , grown infirm of will , and feebly plotting against the government that had rewarded his great ser - vices so ill .

		It is a strong and truthful account of a striking personality .

		The fictitious hero of all these scenes begins to be heroic at a very tender age .

		He is a boy in
Charleston	LOCATION	when
Colonel Moultrie	ORGANIZATION	defends the island fort , and is still a boy amid the scenes of Indian warfare in
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		He goes with
Clark	PERSON	's expedition to
Vincennes	LOCATION	, being identified with the drum - mer-boy of the ' Memoirs , ' and is carried through the water on the shoulders of one of the men .

		In the later chapters , of course , he reaches manhood , becomes a skilful lawyer and a stout Federalist , and ends somewhat surpris - ingly by marrying an emigree -- a French mar - quise of the Old Regime .

		That is , he ends for the purposes of the present novel , but with so much youth and ambition left that we should not be at all surprised to find him figuring once more in some later and consequent work of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	.

		` The Crossing ' is a thor - oughly interesting book , packed with exciting a ; dventure and sentimental incident , yet faith -
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 39 f ul to historical fact both in detail and in spirit .

		It is a capital book for youthful readers espe - cially , because it makes vivid a section of our national history to which the text-books rarely give adequate attention .

		One of the soldiers who was with
Clark	PERSON	at
Vincennes	LOCATION	is the hero of Mr.
Sprague	PERSON	's ' Felice Constant . '

		He makes his way to
Detroit	LOCATION	, spies upon the British garrison there , and becomes entangled in the affections of two young women .

		This embarrassing situation is relieved when one of them turns out to be his long-lost sis - ter .

		Under the circumstances , we see no par - ticular reason why she should have to die in the hour of this revelation , but the author seems to have thought it necessary .

		The story has the conventional villain , conventionally thwart - ed , and is agreeably supplied with exciting adventures .

		It fairly reeks with fine language and luscious sentiment , and is about as unreal as it is possible for such a story to be .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	French 's first book of fiction was a historical romance of the
American Eevolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		His second , now published , and entitled ' The Barrier , ' is a novel of modem American society , business , and politics , as these exist in a
New England	LOCATION	city of moderate size .

		The central figure is that of a promoter who , by unscrupu - lous methods , has made himself a power in the business and political life of the community , and who seeks to round out his achievements by the conquest of the local society .

		Here , how - ever , he finds difficulties of a kind new to his experience , and it is the unexpected ' barrier ' of caste and gentle breeding now standing in his path that gives to the novel its title .

		There is an interesting heroine , a daughter of the aris - tocracy , and the scheming promoter seeks to make her his wife , partly because of her per - sonal attraction for him , and partly because that seems to be the most effective way of real - izing his social ambitions .

		She , impressed by his masterful ways , and revolting against her own contracted and conventional environment , is almost persuaded to join her fortunes with his , but is saved at the last moment by a reveal - ing light cast upon some of his sinister activi - ties .

		Of the other characters , some axe well - studied and others are not ; but there are enough of them to provide a variety of interesting com - plications , and to furnish forth a book that is at least thoroughly readable .

		* It appears to the writer that there is urgent need of more '' nature books '' -- books that are scraped clear of fiction and which display only the carefully articulated skeleton of fact . '

		With these prefatorjr words Mr.
Kobert W. Chambers	PERSON	lures the innocent reader to investigate a col - lection of the wildest yarns ever spun by a wool - gathering imagination .

		The work is a continu - ous narrative only in the sense that the same susceptible young naturalist figures in its sev - eral episodes , which are otherwise distinct sto - ries .

		In the first of them he discovers a living family of great auks and a strange amphibious monster of semi-human attributes .

		In the next , he finds the ' ^ dingue ' and the mammoth disport - ing in the wilds of Labrador .

		The Tasmanian ux is next exploited , and five of its eggs -LRB- as large as hogsheads -RRB- are actually hatched in sight of an international congress of natural - ists held in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The sea-serpent next claims our excited attention , and then we go to the
Everglades	LOCATION	in search of jelly-fish women , invis - ible to the ordinary sense , but having a very material taste for apple-pie , and almost cap - tured by reason of that weakness .

		The last story is a wondrous farrago of nonsense about transmigration and astral bodies in which tlie hero discovers a cat to be his great-aunt , a fact which makes his family relations embarrassingly complicated .

		Each one of these tales introduces an attractive young woman who works tempo - rary havoc with the affections of the naturalist , but since he recovers as promptly as he falls a victim , we need not make him the object of any very deep S3rmpathies .

		We trust , with Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	, that this work ^ may inspire enthu - siasm for natural and scientific research , and inculcate a passion for accurate observation among the young . '

		A work of fiction that oomes dangerously near to being a record of fact is * The Magnetic North , ' by Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	.

		It is a story of the rush to the Klondyke in
1897	DATE	, and , while we do not suppose that the experiences related were exactly those of any particukr set of adventurers , the narrative is so realistic and so minutely circumstantial that it might well be an account of the hardships actually undergone by a party of prospectors during the twelve - month following the news of that famous * strike . '

		The essential truthfulness of the story is apparent upon every page , and there is absolutely no effort to strain the credulity or to introduce sensational matter for the sake of dramatic effect .

		We have simply a matter-of - fact chronicle of the journey up the Yukon , of the daily life of the winter camp , and of the journey 's end the
summer	DATE	following .

		We judge that the author has been on the spot , for she could hardly have pieced together at a distance , and from the tales of travellers , so vivid and veracious a tale .

		There is no little art in the telling , for
Miss Robins	ORGANIZATION	is a practiced hand in novel-writing , but we feel that in this instance she has acted upon the principle that truth is more interesting , if not exactly stranger , than fiction , and that she has been singularly careful not to exceed the bounds of truth .

		A map of the gold region illustrates the book , and adds to its verisimilitude .

		40 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's ' Eulers of Kings ' is a mag - niloquent romance , the work of a scornfully superior person , who this time takes for her subject the haute politique of the European world .

		Her hero is the son of the wealthiest man in
America	LOCATION	, and his romance enda with the capture of no less a heroine than an Aus - trian archduchess , who for the sake of his love abdicates her claims to the throne and -LRB- pre - sumably -RRB- staris across the seas to become a plain citizen of the
American Eepublic	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	is made to figure as the hero 's ally , and between them they accomplish , or are upon the point of accomplishing , the m ^ astery of the world .

		William is to fall heir to German Aus - tria , and , by means of an electrical invention of the hero , is to wipe out the governments of
Eussia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		The American , for his part , has already got the whole of South Amer - ica within his grasp , and seems likely to end as the autocrat of the entire western continent .

		The unreality of this sort of thing is obvious enough , although the writer does show a con - siderable familiarity with the political situation of to-day in
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, as well as a wide acquaintance with the conditions of society in
Vienna	LOCATION	and
Pesth	LOCATION	.

		But the best part of the book is found in the opening chapters , which describe the hero 's life up to manhood ; for not until he reaches that estate does he learn that he is the heir to wealth , or that any other task lies before him than that of making his own unaided way in the world .

		These early chap - ters -- of boyhood in the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	and of student-life in a Western university -- have a marked interest , not to be wholly dulled by the turgid and pretentious manner of their telling .

		Notes ox N ^ e ^ v Novels .

		It is a long time since there has been written as good a story of those that go down into the sea in ships as Mr.
James B. Connelly	PERSON	's ` The Seiners ' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- .

		Like his other prose works , it deals with the life , afloat and ashore , of the fishermen of
Gloucester	LOCATION	; and through the text .

		are interspersed sea-songs that leave one long - ing for a volume of them .

		For the first time , Mr.
Connelly	PERSON	deals with women , just as for the • first time he is writing a formal novel ; and his success in both departures is marked .

		The nar - rative is told by the cousin of one of the three quasi-heroines , himself a sailor on a mackerel boat .

		His captain , with more than one human failing , but every inch a man , is the hero .

		The girl he loves is rather nebulous in character ; and the designer of the boat they sail on is wholly so , though he too is destined to be married at the end .

		But there are no indistinct outlines in the characterization of the woman who makes the trouble -- the * ' other woman ' of the story .

		And the accounts of the sailing , the rivalries of the crews , the catches of fish , the rescuing of those in adversity , the celebrations over victories cul - minating in the great race of the best ships , make up a rounded and most entertaining whole .

		No reader of the book will ever see a mackerel again without increased respect for it and for the men who caught it .

		Ambitious in the extreme is the design of `
The Flame Gatherers	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of
Margaret Hor	PERSON	- ton
Potter	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
John Donald Black	PERSON	-RRB- , highly to be commended for its plan and almost appalling in its scope , and a book , it may be confidently predicted , that will be read for many years .

		For the first time in English fiction , the most fasci - nating period of the Moslem conquest of Hindu - stan is utilized as an historical background for the working out of human destinies .

		The details of this transitional and most interesting epoch are elaborated with Miss
Potter	PERSON	's usual pains - taking care , though so thoroughly that the reader is conscious chiefly of the novelty of scene and place .

		The real interest lies in the illicit love between a captive Moslem prince and the young - est and favorite wife of his royal captor .

		Through half of the novel their story works itself irresistibly through to its tragic close , the un - happy couple dying at last in one another 's arms .

		The latter half of the story deals with the child who inherits the dual natures of both prince and queen .

		The child of a Brahmin , , he accepts Bud - dhism , is driven from the monastery because of his double nature , becomes a hermit , and expiates at last the sin of his predecessors on the spot of its commission .

		Unusual and tremendous as the theme is , it is worked out with full mastery of its materials , affording Miss
Potter	PERSON	an opportu - nity for the setting forth of refined philosophical doctrines regarding human nature and human destiny .

		For the first time in her writings , Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	is successful in depicting masculine hu - manity in a manner satisfactory to the possess - ors of it , in the short stories published under the collective name of ` The Descent of Man , and Other Stories ' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- .

		There are nine of these tales , worked out with the careful elabora - tion and literary finish to be expected of this accomplished writer , and exhibiting a versatility and resource unusual even in her writings .

		The themes are various : intellectual integrity in the face of literary temptation , the reaction upon a man and wife of their adoption of a child in an - swer to the woman 's craving for motherhood , what happens to a husband when he discovers that his wife has two divorced husbands living and their successive impressions upon her plas - tic nature , the searchings of heart that the wives of ` yellow ' journalists have when sufficiently in - telligent , over-refinement and subtlety in love - making and its effects upon both man and wom - an , a concrete example of what ` free ' man * iage leads to , the sahdng of a literary conscience by churchly beneficence , an admirable ghost-story with a background of human frailty , and a tale of the eighteenth century wherein a youthfully self-sufficient son of Salem comes into abrupt contact with Latin civilization .

		A
Texas	LOCATION	Matchmaker ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Andy Adams	PERSON	, is a ` human document ' rather than a work exhibiting literary art , and possess - es a certain historical interest in its portrayals of Hfe on a
Texas	LOCATION	cattle-range thirty years ago , before the days of fences and railways .

		The ranch-owner , an early settler and veteran of the struggle for Texan independence , is the central figure of the story and gives the book its name through his persistent endeavors to make match - es between every maid and bachelor whom he views with favor .

		Accounts of these love affairs , none of which run smooth , combined with inter - polated tales of frontier life , make up the long volume , certain to bring conviction of the auth - or 's knowledge and sincerity .

		The latest book of Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	, ` The Light of the Star ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , is an account of the difficulty a young playwright and a still younger actress of prominence have in persuad - ing managers first , and the play-going public af - terward , of the merits of a drama or two not designed to split the ears of groundlings .

		In the intercourse made necessary by the acceptance and rehearsal of the plays , the two fall in love in the most natural manner , and much of the plot proceeds according to the demands of the conventional romance .

		Remembering Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- land 's earnest protest against literary abuses of one sort and another in his earlier works , it is something of a surprise to find here no adverse criticisms of the combination of theatrical man - agers which has stifled our American drama , and this notwithstanding the fact that all the action of the story depends upon this lamentable con - dition of affairs .

		The novel is unusually short , and not entirely convincing .

		A most appropriate collective title , ` The Givers , ' graces Mrs.
Mary E. Wilkins Freeman	PERSON	's book of short stories published by the Harpers .

		Various forms of generosity , rather than conven - tional love-making , animate the eight tales that make up the volume , and give it both originality and force .

		As before ,
New England	LOCATION	and its peo - ple appear in the pages , all of them sufficiently idealized to make their exact location , even by commonwealths , impossible .

		The first of the stories , which lends its name to the book , is a most laudable satire on the too-common practice of giving gifts that suit the whim of the giver rather than the need of the one to whom they are given .

		The last story , which shares with the initial one the palm of merit , tells of a clergy - man with whom benevolence has been carried al - most to the point of criminality in his earlier life , and who later finds few compunctions in taking the money of a comfortable fellow-wearer of the cloth to relieve the pressing necessities of an unfortunate family .

		The other components of the volume are only less well done , and fully sustain Mrs.
Freeman	PERSON	's reputation as a literary artist ' .

		An Italian novelist of repute , the late Captain
Olivieri Sangiacomo	PERSON	, makes his first bow to an English-speaking audience in ` The Colonel , a Military Romance ' -LRB-
David Nutt	PERSON	-RRB- , translated by Mr.
E. Spender	PERSON	.

		The book has already appeared in French , German , and Swedish ; and its vogue can be explained by its sociological interest , apart from the study in heredity involved in its two leading characters .

		A colonel in the Italian army , on the road to higher rank , and somewhat negligent of regimental affairs in view of greater ambitions , is rudely recalled to his duties through the shooting of several members of his command by a new recruit of lawless tendencies .

		Inves - tigation shows that the young man is the colo - nel 's own unacknowledged son , and retribution swiftly follows .

		The methods and phases of la - bor agitations in
Italy	LOCATION	occupy a large place in the story , with the means taken to suppress them , identical with those used by Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1894	DATE	and just now in use in
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		The book is instructive as well as entertaining , and makes one wish for more of
Captain Sangia	LOCATION	- como 's work .

		Had Mrs.
Elinor Macartney Lane	PERSON	striven less strenuously for corroborative detail to lend an air of veracity to `
Nancy Stair	PERSON	' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , her work would be much less open to criticism .

		The narrative concerns chiefly the daughter of a noble Scottish house , and includes
Robert Bums	PERSON	among its characters .

		Nancy is represented as being a poet , and to this end a fac simile of her autograph is given , written quite plainly in the fashionable hand of the present generation .

		This is a mere detail , however , and does not seri - ously affect the real sprightliness of the book , which is unusual in both conception and execu - tion , the main incident turning upon
Nancy	PERSON	's self-acquired knowledge of legal procedure and the consequent acquittal of her favored lover .

		` The Woman Errant , Being Some Chapters from the Wonder Book of
Barbara	LOCATION	, the Commu - ter 's Wife ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives further delightful acquaintance with a presumably fair unknown , who figures as the heroine of her own narrative , though not of the romance therein contained .

		Barbara takes a family of rather remote cousins who have been deprived of most of the opportuni - ties of life by the indigence and narrowness of their clerical father , secures for them the coun - tenance of a very rich widow and her fashionable friends , and not only gives her favorite among them something to live for , but incidentally some one to love .

		The real merit of the work lies in its delicious characterizations of women by a woman , given with the same zest and joy in the telling that have been apparent in the earlier volumes from the same hand .

		The book is rather distinctly one for
summer	DATE	reading , though it can not fail to interest if read by a winter 's fire .

		After six years , a new edition of Mrs.
Elia W. Peattie	PERSON	's ` The Shape of Fear , and Other Ghostly Tales ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been brought out , a circumstance sufficiently remarkable in these days of novels dead in their first year to be worth noting .

		The book merits its resurrec - tion ; but not more so than that other collection of short stories from Mrs.

Obstinate Corpse	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' A Child of the Rain , ' ` The Room of the Evil Thought , ' ` Story of the Vanishing Patient , ' ` The Piano Next Door , ' ` An Astral Onion , ' * From the Loom of the Dead , ' and ' A Gram - matical Ghost . '

		The anonymous work called ` The High Road ' -LRB- Stone -RRB- purports to be the autobiography of a woman born of humble folk in
West Virginia	LOCATION	, who by dint of sacrificing her individuality , econ - omising in the wrong places , toadying to the powerful , bullying the weak , writing for yellow journals , and doing a number of other things equally not worth doing , finally achieves social position in
New York	LOCATION	, having previously acquired it abroad .

		While there is no reason to doubt that the means employed will generally bring about similar results , the impression gained from the book is that the writer is a journalist rather than a person of social importance .

		As : a close study of existing society at home and abroad , the book presents its most valuable side .

		In ` The Philanthropist ' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , Mr.
J. F. Causton	PERSON	has painted the portrait of a self-seeking and inefficient man wedded to an intractable and extravagant wife , who pays the penalty of his inherent instability of character by sinking with his family to the level of a rather common re - ■ cipient of the bounty of others .

		He has a daugh - ter who preserves her self-respect through all the family vicissitudes , and is rewarded at last with the affection of a rich and worthy man .

		The entire narrative moves within the sphere of British Methodism , and insists upon the in - herent goodness of the more modest members of that communion , even while holding up to ridi - cule the words and deeds of the more pretentious .

		The portraiture is particularly good , and the book unconventionally but highly moral in its conclusions .

		`
Jack Barnaby	PERSON	-LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- is a study of an unfortunate attachment and its effects upon the man and woman participants , as well as on the girl with whom the man afterward falls hon - estly in love .

		It is written by Mr.
Henry James Rogers	PERSON	, its action takes place in
New York	LOCATION	, and it is rather modem in its re-statement of an old problem .

		While not exhibiting marked abilitj ' , it is a work of considerable promise , little more than a short story in length and treatment .

		The first of the stories , which deal very little with love between the sexes , is , curiously enough , the least convincing of them all .

		Mrs.

		Quietly written , the book is in sev - eral respects one of more than ordinary merit .

		A story vivacious almost to the point of ec - centricity is Miss
Valentine Ilawtrey	ORGANIZATION	's ` Perro - nelle ' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		The heroine is a girl of fifteen living in
Paris	LOCATION	at the beginning of the fifteenth century ; and the story concerns itself with her erratic and infelicitous career .

		There is some - thing of the learning of the day interspersed in the narrative , much old French , and a great deal of conversation .

		After Mr.
William Sage	PERSON	's `
Robert Tournay	PERSON	, ' something better than ` Frenchy , the Story of a Gentleman ' -LRB- Scott-Thaw -RRB- was expected from his pen .

		The story is not much more than the sort of thing written for messenger-boys and serving - maids , with a French nobleman of the least con - vincing kind for its hero , and the affairs of the universe shifting obligingly to compass the auth - or 's ends .

		The illustrations , -- quite uninten - tionally , -- show the hero as the sort of combina - tion idiot and knight he seems to have been .

		Mr.

		He has seized upon the historical episodes in that roinantic and little-known step toward the independence of
Italy	LOCATION	for the dra - matic crises of his argument , but has not alto - gether succeeded in connecting them vitally with his fictional characters .

		Mingled with these are chapters which discuss Venetian painting and earlier history , -- most informing , but distinct breaks in the action .

		Taken separately , the in - gredients of the work are admirable ; but they have been so little welded together that the general effect is amateurish .

		Something of the spirit manifest in Mr.

		In `

Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	completes his trilogy of the Civil War as seen from the side of the South , and at the same time reaches his high-water mark in fiction .

		Some of the characters in the two earlier works reappear in this , though the sTovj is in no sense a mere sequel to them .

		It discusses the events preceding the fall of the Confederacy , and in - troduces large elements of commerce and finance .

		The heroine is an appealing character , a girl of many and varied adventures , throughout which she preserves a sweetness and simplicity of char - acter seldom found in modem romance .

		The war scenes are well done .

		Fishing has long been the most literary of pastimes among English-speaking peoples , and though Mr.
H. W. Lanier	PERSON	makes no effort to connect ` The Romance of
Piscator	PERSON	' -LRB- Holt -RRB- with the older traditions of the art , he has made a really delightful and humorous tale out of the pursuit of a maiden and any number of fish , the manner in which each interest gives way to the other being told with great gusto and evident enjoyment .

		The fisherman loses himself in the lover , and the lover in the fisherman , many a time before the end is reached and the hardy rival beaten in both contests of skill .

		It is also to be said that when the end comes it is a toss - up as to whether the maiden was fishing for the piscator or the piscator for the maiden ; assured - ly none of his mighty catches had any such ele - ment of prolonged uncertainty about them .

		Without literary pretension ,
Mrs Fannie Hardy Eekstrom	ORGANIZATION	has embodied a variety of human inter - ests in her tales of lumber-camps in
Maine	LOCATION	, col - lected in a small volume with the title ` The Penobscot Man ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Dealing with ele - mental forces in the great northern forests , the American , whether of white or aboriginal blood , acquires something of the character of his sur - roundings , and is moved to deeds of heroism , the most striking of which are set forth in this book , oftentimes in the very language of the actors in them .

		Plain and uninteresting as the daily life of a lumberer seems to be , there are emergencies arising wherein he proves himself strenuous in the better sense of the word , doing brave things with a fine unconsciousness wholly denied the usual preachers of strenuosity . '

		A Forest Drama ' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- is rather a melo - drama , in which an escaped English convict runs away with a beautiful English girl visiting in the wilds of
Canada	LOCATION	, carries her to his camp far in the north , and waits accommodatingly while an English and a French-Canadian lover rescue her from his toils .

		The treatment of the wild scenes through which the heroine is conducted shows familiarity with them , and continued ac - tion makes the book interesting .

		Two editors of woman 's pages in daily jour - nals , one a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	man and the other a Southern woman , carry on the correspondence which makes up the story of ` Daphne and Her Lad ' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The authors , effectually concealing themselves in their characters , are Mr.
M. J. Lagen	PERSON	and
Miss Cally Ryland	ORGANIZATION	, and their work has much the impress of reality ; at least , the letters are quite of the sort that youthful jour - nalists might write one another in the same cir - cumstances .

		The letters are announced in the book as ` not originally intended for publication , ' but bear marks of close editing and rewriting to fit them to the tale , the end of which is evidently an after-thought -- and not a particularly happy one .

		` Crecy ' is a little
New Jersey Quaker	ORGANIZATION	of the Revolutionary period , in Miss
Edith Lawrence	PERSON	's novel of that name -LRB-
F. M. Buckles & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and it is supposed to be made up of the letters passing between herself and the members of her family during the British occupancy of the newly de - clared State .

		In the young lady are mingled strains of the North and South , accounting for the pleasant mixture of forethought and reck - lessness that makes up her character .

		There is an abundance of fighting and love-making , with a joyful ending in the interests of international amity .

		In ` The Jessica Letters ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- there will be found a most refreshing quality of classicism , imparted by a real love for and knowledge of the Latin poets , a most graceful learning in - corporating itself with a pretty love-story .

		The letters are supposed to pass between the literary editor of a
New York	LOCATION	journal and the daughter of a Methodist parson in the South , the acquaint - ance beginning with her calling on him in his office in regard to work for the journal , and con - tinuing , through the excellence of the reviews she writes for him , until literary interests are merged in the sentimental .

		The editor has a philosophy of his own , based on wide reading of classical authorities , and his strictures on mod - ern sentimentality will be enjoyed by many who find themselves in a minority to-day .

		The work is anonymous , but its author has no reason to disown it .

		The conversation of the leisure classes of Eng - land has seldom been so exhilaratingly painted as by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	in ` The
Island Phari	LOCATION	- sees ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		With one marked exception , the characters are the well bom , well bred , edu - cated , cultivated , and Avealthy folk of the moth - er country .

		This exception is a youthful adven - turer from the continent , half Dutch and half French , who has seen and known the realities of life at first-hand .

		The protagonist of the book meets him by chance , and disillusionment regarding the ideals of his class follows until he is no longer to be ranked with the thinkers who are ` safe . '

		He procures for the foreigner a position as tutor in the family with which he expects to intermarry ; and this proves his un - doing .

		A more direct blow at social complacency has seldom been given , and the book should make good reading for those whose opinions are not prescribed for them by their worldly position .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		An industrious col - lector and careful student in this department of literature , the author has got together a goodly store of curious items , which he generously illus - trates with a very attractive display of ancient title-pages , rude woodcuts from primers and other textbooks , exteriors and interiors of historic school-houses , portraits of famous pedagogues , and other matters , interspersed with frequent ex - tracts from the old readers and spellers that have now in many cases become so hard to find and so impossible of purchase except by the rich .

		Of necessity , the exercises described in this volume are modified to suit a more tender age ; but they take the child of ten and bring him to an improved condition of bodily health and strength quite as thoroughly as those set forth in the previous works for men and women .

		As in the former books , little or no apparatus is prescribed ; but a difference will be found in the end sought for .

		While with the elders ' jiu-jitsu ' was the art of hurting with - out being hurt , with the youngsters health and strength are sought for Avithout regard to the uses to which they can be put .

		The book , like its predecessors , is profusely illustrated from photo - graphs of both boys and girls actually engaged in the amicable contests of which the exercises are chiefly composed , which have the advantage over ordinary turning , gymnastics , and calisthen - ies of the western world in being immediately competitive .

		The amount of space required will make the introduction of * jiu-jitsu ' somewhat ; difficult in schools without gymnasiums ; but it is well worth trying at home , where its demon - strated efficiency should lead to its introduction as part of a complete system of education , after the manner of the ancient Greeks .

		But we have lacked an in - tensive study of the subject considered as a whole .

		The privations of the troops is fre - quently mentioned , the thesis taking up this mat - i ter in detail and showing the causes to lie not ; only in a lack of funds to carry on the war , but ' < in mismanagement and internal jealousy .

		It must • be confessed that the details of the rivalries , the mutinies , the strife , the cabals , and the frequent mercenary motives manifest , make one feel that our fathers were not so perfect as they have | often been pictured , or that we have vastly im - proved since those days .

		The Newburg Addresses , not commonly accessible , appear as an appendix .

		Emerson 's ' Letters and Social Aims ' and his ' Poems ' are the latest volumes in the new ' Cen - tenary ' edition of his works , edited by Mr.
Edward W. Emerson	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Houghton , Miflain & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume of the poems restores the pieces omitted by
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	himself in
1876	DATE	, but restored in the '
Riverside	PERSON	' edition of
1883	DATE	.

		There are also some new poems and fragments , including about a score of early pieces .

		The notes of this volume are of great value for eluci - dation and historical commentary .

B. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of three text-books in French that are deserving of particular consideration . '

		A Companion to

		An adapta - tion of
Mgrimee	ORGANIZATION	's ' Chronique du R6gne de
Charles WX.	PERSON	, made by Professor
Ernest Weekley	PERSON	, is espe - cially for the quiz method of teaching , besides offer - ing an interesting text .

Charles Alexander Nel	PERSON	- son , an analytical index to the first twenty-five volumes of that periodical , covering the period from
January , 1891	DATE	, to
May , 1903	DATE	.

		The fortunate libraries and individuals who possess complete sets of the ' Review ' will be grateful for this work , which now transforms a row of bound vol - umes into a veritable encyclopaedia of education , ready for consultation upon almost every imagina - ble modern educational problem .

		Analysis by top - ics is the leading feature of this index , and the work has been intelligently performed .

		The work is a dictionary catalogue -LRB- author and subject -RRB- , extending to upwards of two hundred double-col - umned pages .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16 , 1904	DATE	The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Was the pioneer American trail west of the Missoui-i river , and the results of that exploration of 1804-6 were of tremendous importance to the
United States	LOCATION	, and they were never more apparent than now .

		A publication relating to the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition , just issued by
Q. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ,
New York	LOCATION	, stands peculiarly alone .

		This edition is a two volume , 8vo one , called '' * The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Claris	ORGANIZATION	, 1804-1904 . ''

		The author , Mr.
Olin D. Wheeler	PERSON	, is the well known writer of the popular Wonderland series of the
Northern Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	, in connection with which he made his studies and researches for this work .

		Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	has travelled several thousand miles over the route of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		He has camped out , climbed mountains , followed old Indian trails , and visited remote points made memorable by those explorers .

		Their route across the Bitterroot mountains has been followed , identified , and mapped .

		• • The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and Clarlc '' is illustrated in color and half tone from paintings , drawings , and maps , by
Paxson	ORGANIZATION	,
DeCamp	ORGANIZATION	, and
Russell	PERSON	, made under Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	's direction , and from photographs taken specially for the purpose .

		The writer tells his own story , and supplements it with pertinent extracts from
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, and a host of other historical and narrative Avriters that connect the past with the present .

		Exact experts and photographic reproductions , in half-tone , from the ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	are given .

		A chapter is devoted to the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, another to the preparatory measm-es for the exploration , and another to the history of each man of the expedition so far as known , including a discussion of the death of Captain lyewis .

		1 1 The
Louisiana	LOCATION	Purchase Exposition at
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Centennial to be held at
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, in
1905	DATE	, make this work peculiarly timely because written from the standpoint of actual knowledge of past and present conditions of the old trail and country .

		♦ * The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' should be found in every public and private library in the land , and the general reader will find in reading through its pages of large , clear type that truth is , indeed , stranger than fiction .

		CHICAGO MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE There was a time when men stole wives , when they bought wives , when they got wives free , and when they expected dowries .

		There was a time when women did not marry at all , when one woman mar - ried a number of men , when with other women she married one man , and when alone she was married to a husband .

		At different periods either , man or wife , could terminate the relation ; only one or the other could do so ; neither could ; nor could both .

		This evolution of marriage and divorce , under prim - itive and subsequent social conditions , is interest - ingly and accurately told by Professor

		NOTES 68 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 69 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 69 THE FUTURE OF VERSE .

		An interesting essay on ` The Future of Eng - lish Verse ' is contributed by Mr.
Henry New	PERSON	- bolt to ' The International Quarterly . '

		As one of the most vigorous and agreeable of living English verse-makers , Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	is well worth listening to , and his optimistic temper leads him to conclusions that can not fail to prove gratify - ing to all with whom poetry is a serious con - cern , and who believe with
Shelley	PERSON	that the poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	begins by quoting these remarks made in conversation by the late
Frederick Myers	PERSON	: ' There is no future for English verse ; English poetry has come to an end ... Blank verse is worked out , and the rhymes have all been used up .

		The only one left was heaven and
Devon	PERSON	, and now that has been taken ; there are no more new ones . '

		Since Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	was himself the appropriator of the rhyme thus whimsically characterized as ' the only one left , '' his attention was naturally arrested by the assertion so dogmatically made .

		It had a per - sonal bearing , because , if it was true , Othello 's occupation was indeed gone .

		But he dissented strongly from the pronouncement , and after - wards was constrained to express his own view to the contrary in the paper which is now before us .

		That view , as briefly stated by him , is that ' English verse will at any rate not come to an end because there is no possible future before it ; on the contrary , it is a mine with more than one old seam unexhausted and a number of new seams almost unopened , though here and there we may detect the shafts and pick-marks of past centuries about their approaches . '

		To lead up to his own argument , Mr.
New	PERSON	- bolt next falls foul of Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, who is perhaps unduly conservative in his insistence upon an adherence to the old forms and models of verse .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	is all for the orthodox rhythms , and looks askance upon the efforts of recent poetry to escape from their trammels .

		He complains that Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	and ' several other poets of real ability make a prac - tice of sMghting or deliberately misplacing accent . '

		Admitting that good blank verse must not be too monotonously iambic , he neverthe - less insists that ` there must be a limit to per - missible departure from the normal and reg - ular line . '

		Having illustrated by ample quota - tion these two opposing views , Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	makes an epigrammatic summary of the logical impasse to which they seem to lead us : * We are thus in a doubly hopeless position ; those who follow Mr.
Frederick Myers	PERSON	forMd any repetition of the past ; while those who follow Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	still more strenuously for - bid anything except a repetition of the past . '

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	's way of extricating poetry from this tangle is to welcome the licenses of modern poets as legitimate extensions of metrical art , and to foresee a constantly increasing divergence 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, from the conventional canons of rhythmical composition .

		He holds that ' there is practically no known limit to the variety of blank verse / that bad rhymes are sometimes better than good ones because of the relief they afford to a wearied sense , and that ' the expansion of Eng - lish verse must be accomplished by the explora - tion and conquest of new metres . '

		All of these views are cleverly supported by skilful argu - ments and modern instances ; but they seem to us to constitute a dangerous body of doctrine .

		Nothing is really gained by showing that the great poets have all been guilty upon occasion of gross irregularities .

		The liberties which a Milton or a Shelley takes with his material are usually -LRB- although not always -RRB- justified by the felicity of the results produced ; the average minor poet of our day will , however , do well to avoid imitating the vagaries of his masters , and confine himself to the study of their normal manner .

		The attempt to follow the masters also in their departures from precedent is apt to have disastrous consequences -- a fact of which the examination of some hundreds of volumes of very modem verse has made us painfully aware .

		We find that whenever we venture to point out some marked cacophony of diction or some gross violation of obvious metrical requirement , we promptly hear from the aggrieved bard , and the burden of his message is that
Shakespeare	PERSON	or
Coleridge	PERSON	or
Tennyson	PERSON	did thus and so .

		With mingled scorn and triumph , the illustrative verses are paraded before our chastened gaze , and we are presumably crushed by the evidence .

		That we are not crushed in reality is due to the fact that two ways of escape lie before us .

		One of them is to retort boldly : ' If so -- the less Shakespeare -LSB- or
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, or Tennyson -RSB- he ; ' the other is to examine the case closely , when we shall usually discover that there is no real resemblance between the passages brought into comparison .

		The technical criticism of new poetry would come to an end altogether if it were once allowed that the old masters , in their every line , offered us impeccable moidels and texts of canonical authority .

		And yet this is what the greatest part of Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	's argu - ment , and the argument of most other modem advocates of vers Hires , reduces to .

		They begin by telling us that we should not bow down to authority , and they end by the triumphant cita - tion of chapter and verse in support of what - ever eccentricity they may at the moment be engaged in defending .

		The upshot of Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	's discussion seems to be that the hope of poetry is in the develop - ment of freer and more flexible verse-forms , that a writer should be applauded rather than censured for his lapses from regularity .

		For our part , we are inclined to think that such encouragement of license is ill-advised , and that we shall continue to get far too much of it with - out this special provocation .

		One of the most marked vices of current literature , verse and prose alike , is a painful straining for effect , a determination to be original at whatever cost .

		But the sort of originality thus achieved is purely superficial , and does not conceal , for any reader of critical discernment , the poverty of the underlying thought .

		The poet who really has something to say , and who possesses in any measure the divine gift of expression , need feel no compunotion about using the old rhymes and rhythms in the old accepted way .

		It is the spirit that truly matters , and not the mechanics of construction .

		To hesitate at the employment of the measures long since perfected is to be daunted by the veriest bugbear imagined by timid souls for their own undoing ; the old bot - tles will do well enough if the wine is but new .

		We are minded at this moment of the young American poet who has recently wrought , in the orthodox forms and upon one of the most timeworn of themes , an imaginative structure of fresh and wonderful beauty -- a modern poem in every essential sense -- yet whose achievement has been censured by horny-eyed critics because it dared to take for its frame - work so old a story as the Prometheus myth .

		That poetry is at present suffering a decline the world over is probably true , but only the observer of little faith can believe that it is going into definite bankruptcy .

		The history of literature offers too many instances of renewed life following upon decline to give countenance to any such doleful vaticination .

		These cyclic changes are inevitable in the course of artistic development of whatever sort , and the alterna - tion of ebb and flow never fails .

		In English poetry , for example , a single instance should suffice to strengthen the faintest of heart .

		When , about sixty years ago , the great poetic impulse of the early nineteenth century was well-nigh spent , the outlook seemed no brighter than is ours to-day ; yet a generation later , Eng - lish song was again at full tide , and the age of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Swinburne	PERSON	had come fairly to rival the age of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		We are not , then , greatly concerned about the exhaustion of rhymes and rhythmes that so depressed Mr.
Myers	PERSON	, nor are we of the opinion that in the new veins which Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	would have us open is the hope of English jwetry .

		New departures there will doubtless be , new intricacies of melodious design and subtle new harmonies of poetic diction ; but they will not be forced , they will appear as the natural utter - ance of the poets of the new race .

		And there will be such poets , not because of the invention of new forms demanding embodiment , but because the ever-changing life of the human
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 56 soul will make imperative its need of new self - expression .

		And men will come more and more to realize , in the words of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, that from the poets alone they may learn what are ` the perennial sources of happiness , ' and they will look back upon
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as the truest of prophets when he declared the future of poetry to be ' immense . '

		THE LAST HOME OF SHELLEY .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Bay of
Lerici	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
July 8 , 1904	DATE	.

		Presumably there are many
Shelley	PERSON	lovers in different parts of the world who will recall this eighty-second anniversary of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's death ,
July 8 , 1822	DATE	.

		But , as far as I can judge , my own celebration here on the shores where he made his last home , and from which he depaxted on that fatal sail from which he was never to return , is quite a solitary one .

		* Ecco !


Casa di Shelley !	ORGANIZATION	'

		ejaculated the boatman , as we rounded the point of
San Terenzo	LOCATION	, after a two hours ' sail with favoring winds from
Spezia	LOCATION	, and our boat danced on the waves of the
Bay of Lerici	LOCATION	-- * this divine bay , ' as
Shelley	PERSON	called it .

		Nor does the adjective seem excessive to one who looks upon it ; for even the Bay of
Naples	LOCATION	, though larger , is scarcely more beautiful .

		Almost land-locked by rugged castles at either end , the waves wash a sandy beach on which a few houses are picturesquely grouped , with a background of gently-sloping hills covered with woods of ilex and walnut .

		No wonder that
Shelley	PERSON	loved the spot , and wrote of it in one of his last letters , ' My only regret is that the sum - mer must ever pass . '

		The house being vacant , and the padrone hav - ing an eye to a possible tenant , we had no diffi - culty in getting admission .

		There have been changes , of course , in these eighty-two years .

		The location is no longer as solitary , nor are the inhabitants of
San Terenzo	LOCATION	as wild and noisy , nor , owing to a modem road , does the house stand in the very midst of the waves as described by Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	in her account of the life there .

		But the interior is quite the same , -- a central room , three small bed-rooms leading out of it but with - out other entrance , a kitchen dark and gloomy at the back of the house and across the stairway landing ; furniture scant and shabby , and of the familiar lodging-house type ; looking-glasses and fancy clocks galore , but not one comfortable chair , nor the vestige of a rug to relieve the uneven and dingy stone floor ; not so much as a closet or wardrobe , or even a hook on which to hang a coat or gown .

		If , outside , one under - stands
Shelley	PERSON	's love of the place as a poet , equally inside one understands
Mary Shelley	PERSON	's hatred of it as a housekeeper .

		Ill-constructed , unventilated , and without a single modem conve - nience even to-day , its only attraction is the wide terrace running entirely across the front of the house .

		This commands the whole beautiful view of the tideless beach , the blue waters , wooded hills , precipitous rocks , the near castles of Lerici and
San Terenzo	LOCATION	, and the distant point of
Porto Venere	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , one may truly feel
Shelley	PERSON	as a ` presence plain in the place , ' may fancy him walking up and down , adding new stanzas to the ` Triumph of Life , ' or writing some of the lovely lyrics so full of local color , -- ' Where music and moonlight and feeling are one / or , ' I sat and saw the vessels glide Over the ocean bright and wide , Like splrit-wingfid chariots sent O'er some serenest element For ministrations strange and far . '

		I have been glad to receive here two interesting recent books on
Shelley	LOCATION	, -- the privately-printed ` Appreciation ' by Mr.
Thomas B. Slicer	PERSON	, and a book printed by the
Clarendon Press of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, ` An Examination of the
Shelley Manuscripts	PERSON	of the Bodleian Library , ` by Mr.
C. D. Locock	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	Two such books , one a sympathetic considera - tion of
Shelley	PERSON	as man and poet , the other a tex - tual study of a kind almost never accorded to a modem poet , are an emphatic testimony of the great change that has come over the public atti - tude regarding
Shelley	PERSON	in these latter days .

		At the time of his death , scarcely fifty people knew anything about his poetry .


Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	, which had turned him out and badly treated him during his life , made tardy recognition of his merits seven years after his death by holding a debate between
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	under - graduates as to which was the greater poet ,
Byron	PERSON	or Shelley .

		To be sure ,
Byron	PERSON	was declared the greater by a majority of fifty-seven , -- a decision which would probably be reversed now , -- but it showed at least an appreciation of his genius which has been growing year by year ever since .


Robert Browning	PERSON	's ` Memorabilia , ' -- ` Ah , did you once see Shelley plain .

		And did he stop and speak to youT ' is one of the finest tributes ever paid by one great poet to another .

		Rossetti ,
Garnett	PERSON	,
Forman	PERSON	, and
Dowden	PERSON	, by notes , biographies , and bibliogra - phies , have made such careful and exhaustive studies of every scrap of his writing that we are now in a position to understand and enjoy
Shel	PERSON	- ley as well as so peculiar a genius ever can be understood .

		It can not be said that these two lat - est books add anything very essential ; yet they are both written in the spirit commended by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	thirty years ago in his essay on
Shel	PERSON	- ley , -- ` they help us toward a true text of our greatest modern poet . '


Italy	LOCATION	, with good reason , claims
Shelley	PERSON	as al - most her very own .

		Here he spent the
last four years	DATE	of his life , here his best poetry was writ - ten , here he came to his untimely death , and here all of his material part that was spared from flood and fire lies buried .

		A monument by an Italian sculptor at
Via Reggio	ORGANIZATION	commemorates his memory on the shores he loved so well ; but it is in the
Bay of Lerici	LOCATION	, off the line of tourist travel and seldom visited , that one finds oneself in the very spot dearest of all to
Shelley	PERSON	's heart and most congenial to his poetic spirit .

August 1	DATE	, t m ^ to % aokB .

		A
Follower 's View of Whistler	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is a pity , from one point of view at least , tliat so much has been written about Mr.
James McXeill Whistler	PERSON	since his death just a year ago .

		The flood of reminiscence and criticism has , to be sure , aroused an interest in
Whistler	LOCATION	the man , and to some extent also in
Whistler	LOCATION	the artist , in quarters where he was hitherto quite unknown .

		But hasty comment and garbled anecdotes soon satisfied that interest , and by the time the best articles and the first books were ready some of us had to confess to being a little tired of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's unparal - lelled egotism and * amazing ' eccentricity in manners and nocturnes .

		And yet , if the news - paper anecdotes and magazine ' appreciations ' had a certain charm -- that charm which crops out in everything that is written , however per - functorily , about Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	, -- so much the more are the longer and really adequate disquisi - tions that are still appearing calculated to win and hold even a waning attention .

		For Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	had the distinction , rare in this pleas - antly conventional age , of holding with all his soul to one supreme conviction ; and if his creed involved the assumption that nobody was quite so important as Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	, it was not unique in that respect , but rather in the tenacity with which he clung to it , and in the essential and wholly delightful absurdities with which he emphasized its principal tenets .

		This is possibly a roundabout way of explain - ing that , while the expectation aroused by the announcement of a new book about
Whistler	LOCATION	may no longer have as keen an edge as could be wished , the book itself may safely be counted on to create enthusiasm .

		Particularly is this true of the latest addition to
Whistler	LOCATION	literature , -- a stout quarto volume with the tdtle ^ Whistler as I Knew Him , ' by Mr.
Mortimer Menpes	PERSON	.

		Its distinction among books on the same subject lies first in the number and beauty and interest of its illustrations , and next in its fresh and valuable point of view .

		Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	met
Whistler	LOCATION	while the latter was engaged in print - ing his Venetian etchings , instantly recognized his genius , and forthwith left the schools at
Kensington	LOCATION	to become his bond-slave , ' follower , ' and friend .

		In the characteristdc course of a friendship with
Whistler	LOCATION	, he finally became an enemy and an outcast , whose very name the Master professed to have forgotten .

		But he bore his exile from the ranks of the ' followers ' philosophically ; and now , looking back with *
Whistler	LOCATION	as I Knew Him .

		By
Mortimer Menpes	PERSON	.

		Illustrated in color , etc. .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		vivid pleasure to the days of his discipleship , he writes of the Master with dignity and respect quite untainted by bitterness .

		In addition to his intimate knowledge of the man and the artist , Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	has another important quali - fication for making a book about
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		He owns a large and representative collection of
Whistler	LOCATION	's etchings and dry-points , and a press whose excellent work dates back in some meas - ure to his early apprenticeship under
Whistler	LOCATION	, who taught him the art of printing and even allowed him the special privilege of printing from his own cherished plates .

		All the etchings and dry-points reproduced in the present vol - ume , and constituting three-fourths of the hun - dred and thirty-four full-page illustrations in tint and color , are from proofs owned by Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	.

		Among them are several first states , unique impressions , and series of variant prints from the same plate , which , besides being of intrinsic interest , serve to throw light on Whist - ler 's painstaking methods of work .

		These are also described in detail , but without technical - ity , in the chapter entitled ` The Etcher . '

		Besides the hundred etchings , there are about thirty illustrations exemplifying every other department of
Whistler	LOCATION	's artistic activity except muiial decorating , and several portraits from Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	's plates or from photographs .

		All the illustrations were printed and engraved at Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	's own press , under his personal supervision .

		This means that the work is exceedingly well done , and has something of
Whistler	LOCATION	's spirit .

		It is a pity that the relation between pictures and context is not closer .

		Some of the less familiar etchings and paintings need a word of comment , and some suggestion of the basis on which a selection was made would not come amiss .

		But perhaps all this would be contrary to the Whistlerian canon which declares that pictorilal and literary art are utterly divergent in aims and methods ; or to that other canon which advises the ` plain man ' to keep clear of matters artistic , since he does not and never can understand them .

		However this may be , Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	has chosen to write not a critique of
Whistler	LOCATION	's art , nor a formal exposition of its principles , but a series of familiar essays , each dealing with some phase or other of
Whistler	LOCATION	as Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	knew him in his prime .

		The latter is not an artist in two mediums , like the author of ` The Gentle Art of Making Enemies ' ; his literary work is painstaking but not finished , his sense of humor o ' f the inexpressive English sort that we Ameri - cans should call merely good-natured tolerance of other men 's foibles .

		But his genuine admira - tion for
Whistler	LOCATION	gives force to his style and vitality to his portraiture , which , considering the close relation between the two men , seems to be just and well-balanced , though more
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 superficial in some directions than we have a right to expect .

		For example , the worst chapter in the book is the introductory one , which is sharp with irrita - tion over what Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	considers the glib exaggerations of many of
Whistler	LOCATION	's critics , and their too enthusiastic attention to his literary achievements .

		Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	considers ' The Gentle Art ' a dangerous document , and per - haps it is if one misses its point and unity and persists in viewing it as ^ so much biographical data , by which
Whistler	LOCATION	and the Enemies are to be known to posterity , instead of as a caustic and very brilliant satire upon modern aesthetic .

		But perhaps it is too much to expect one of the Enemies to understand the impersonal bearings of ' The Gentle Art . '

		The lack of penetration shown in the preface is offset by a fascinating first chapter , called ' In the Day 's Round , ' which describes a typical day spen-t in
Whistler	LOCATION	's company .

		It began invariably with an imperious summons , which arrived by the first post , and in obedience to which Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	hurried to
Whistler	LOCATION	's house .

		Together the two would proceed to the studio , where the first business of the day was the reading of `` Whistler 's invariably exciting mail , and the making of elaborate plans for ' scalp - ing ' the venturesome writers .

		Then
Whistler	LOCATION	would take his little pochade box , and they would stroll off to the Embankment or down a side street in
Chelsea	LOCATION	, and the
Master	ORGANIZATION	would sketch . '

		It might be a fish-shop with eels for sale at so much a plate , and a few soiled children in the foreground ; or perhaps a sweet-stuff shop , and the children standing with their faces glued to the pane .

		There we would stay and paint until lunch - eon time , sitting on rush-bottomed chairs borrowed from the nearest shop .

		Wherever
Whistler	LOCATION	went he caused interest and excitement : men , women and children flocked about him -- especially chil - dren ,
Chelsea	PERSON	children , shoals of them .

		If one of them appealed to
Whistler	LOCATION	from the decorative standpoint , he would say , '' Not bad , Menpes , eh ? ''

		This was perhaps a very soiled and grubby little person indeed .

		But
Whistler	LOCATION	would take her kindly by the hand and ask her where she lived ; and the three of us would trot along to ask the mother if she might sit , the child with its upturned , flower-like though dirty face , gazing with perfect confidence at
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		And the Mas - ter would talk to her in a charmingly intimate way about his work and his aspirations . ''

		Now we are going to do great things together , '' he would say ; and the dirty-faced child , blinking up at him , seemed almost to understand . '

		Then would come the tussle with the mother , who naturally wanted to wash her child , and finally the three would hurry back to the studio for luncheon -- cooked by
Whistler	LOCATION	himself -- and a long afternoon of work .

		When the child had gone off , tired but happy over the toys that it was part of Menpes 's duty to provide for her , the two friends visited the tailor , -- where the discussion over the Master 's wardrobe ` gener - ally ended in a violent attack on the tailor , ' -- or made the round of the galleries ,
Whistler	LOCATION	drop - ping an enigmatic ' Ha !

		ha !

		amazing ! '

		here and there .

		Then came dinner at the
Arts Club	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps a visit to the theatre , where
Whistler	LOCATION	's strange antics diverted attention from the stage , and afterwards a supper at the
Hogarth Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here
Whistler	LOCATION	gathered all the men about him by the sheer fascination of his talk .

		Finally there was the walk home , -- always around by the embankment , -- ` To look at some nocturne , perhaps a fish-shop , which
Whistler	LOCATION	was trying to commit to memory .

		He would talk aloud as he created the idea for one of his marvellous pictures : '' Look at that golden Interior with the two spots of light , and that old woman with the chequered shawl .

		See the warm purple tone outside going away up to the green of the sky , and the shadows from the windows thrown on the ground .

		What an exquisite lace - work they form ! ''

		He would say all this aloud , and I would walk back with him to his studio , and talk with him , sometimes , until two o'clock in the
morning	TIME	.

		Then he would say , as I was leaving : '' Now , Menpes , remember , I want you to be here early in the morning .

		As for me , I am going to make my mind a blank until I paint that fish-shop , and you must be here early . '' '

		And no matter how early he arrived .

		Whist - ler was always ready , alert , sparkling , exquisite , indefatigable , -- and with thought for nothing but his own affairs .

		No wonder that the Fol - lowers , whose youthful enthusiasms furnish miaterial for
Menpes	ORGANIZATION	's most interesting chapter , never confided their association , much less their individual ambitions , to the Master who inspired them .

		He would have laughed them to scorn , and then set them to grinding ink for him .

		Two of the
Followers	ORGANIZATION	, Menpes and
Walter Sick	PERSON	- ert , were acknowledged pupils of
Whistler	LOCATION	, though he never set them tasks nor looked at their finished work , nor gave them formal instruction of any kind .

		But they felt , and no doubt rightly , that his companionship was worth more to them than the systematic criti - cism of a less gifted teacher .

		He dropped them encouraging words occasionally , and once he confided to them the secret of drawing , as it luad been revealed to him in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		But though they seldom dared ask questions , they had the freedom of the studio , could , watch
Whistler	LOCATION	at
work day after day	TIME	, study hk methods , and feel his influence .

		Over all the Followers this influence was supreme , and they carried
Whistler	LOCATION	's paradoxical creed to more paradoxical extremes . '

		Nature , we said , is for the painter a decorative patch ; a portrait , a blot of color , merely an object 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, in relation to a background ... For the painter , nature should be tilted forward and without dis - tance -- a Japanese screen , a broad mass of tones -- a piece of technique .

		The face in a portrait should not be more Important than the back - ground .

		The moment you realized that it was a face , the literary art came in ... In the end we swept away all faces .

		Features , we felt , were unnecessary . '

		When
Whistler	LOCATION	talked of breadth and sim - plicity , the Followers ' pictures resembled clean sheets of paper .

		Then they caught the ` grey - panel ' craze , and saw Nature , which they had previously painted in prismatic tints , in dull monotone .

		Next , in a moment of revolt , they dast loose from all
Whistler	LOCATION	's methods except his boldness and originality , and one of them went so far as to etch a plate every day at luncheon with a four-tined fork , by way of extra bold - ness .

		Menpes made a proof from one of the plates , which had been intended for the portrait of a celebrated lady artist , and it was found to bear more resemblance to a rainy day .

		But that did not disturb the Follower 's serenity , nor his belief in his own and
Whistler	LOCATION	's genius .

		Other chapters are equally full of quotable bits , but space forbids more than a hasty glance at them .

		It is pleiasant to find that according to Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	,
Whistler	LOCATION	did not catch and fry his landlady 's pet goldfish because he disliked their names of Eose and Fanny , but merely told the story about another eccentric painter .

		The celebrated quarrel with the
Royal Society of British Artists	ORGANIZATION	has a chapter to itself .

		WTiist - ler 's parting shot , uttered when he and his following withdrew from the Society , -- * I lam taking with me the Artists , and I leave the British , ' -- has here a diverting sequel .

		Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	met the party at the
Hogarth Club	ORGANIZATION	, and in an aside asked
Whistler	LOCATION	what he meant to do with the artists . '

		Lose them , of course , ' replied
Whistler	LOCATION	, promptly .

		As has already been suggested , Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	's treatment of his subject does not go far beyond the surface .

		He plaints a portrait , rather than essays a study of
Whistler	LOCATION	's complex nature .

		His explanation of that complexity is that , ' instead of being either enigmatical , or , as other critics have decided , a dual personality .

		Whistler was absolutely artistic in every relation of life .

		This motive explains for Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	his seem - ing vanity , his eccentricity in dress and conduct , his delight in stinging repartee and correspond - ence , -- in epigrams exploited for the epigrams ' sake .

		But making all possible allowance for the artistic temperament , and granting that the real
Whistler	LOCATION	was the * gentle , sweet , sympa - thetic , ' thoroughly lovable personality , who revealed himself rarely to his intimates , even Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	must admit that there is still an unexplained margin of combativeness , a cloak of seemingly impenetrable egotism , which effect - ually hid this real man from the rest of the world .

		Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	speaks of it occasionally , then drops it without explanation , and reverts to his original thesis .

		He tells us , then , nothing new about the depths of
Whistler	LOCATION	's nature , but gives us a delightful account of his habits and manners . '

		Whistler As I Knew Him ' is pro- fusely and beautifully illustrated , but it is not a picture-book in the sense which implies that it is nothing but a picture-book .

		A
History of Human Marriage	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The oldest of all existing institutions is the family .

		In some form or other , the union of father and mother and child must have existed from the earliest dawn of human life .

		The study of the marriage relation , therefore , car - ries us back to a past that is ancient beyond all reckoning .

		Much has been written on this subject , though students have usually limited their researches to some particular phase of the question or to some particular period of its development .

		But a work has lately appeared that in a measure deals with the whole his - tory of this institution , and carries the dis - cussion down to the immediate present .

		It is true , the author 's purpose is to trace the history of marriage in the three homes of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race only ; but to accomplish this he has been compelled to make investigations and to include data which throw a flood of light on the institution elsewhere .

		The author .

		Professor
George Elliott	PERSON	How - ard , is at present professorial lecturer in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		His work comprises three solid volumes of about five hundred pages each , the result of 3 ` ears of continuous labor .

		The general reader will peruse the text with sustained interest ; he will experience little dif - ficulty in following the author 's argument or in appreciating the force and significance of his conclusions .

		The scholar will find in the numerous foot-notes , the extensive bibliography , and the carefully executed index , many addi - tional points of excellence .

		What first impresses the reader is the vast - ness of the field which the author has aimed to cover , the wide reading and the extensive research that the task has demanded , and the mass of materials that have to be studied and criticized .

		But on closer examination one is * A
History of Matrimonial Institutions	ORGANIZATION	.

		J THE DIAL .

		59 still more impressed with the masterly manner in which this variety of materials is handled .

		In studying a question such as this , it is diflB - cult to get entirely away from the view-point of our social surroundings .

		In this respect Pro- fessor
Howard	PERSON	has succeeded admirably ; his treatment is purely scientific .

		He has studied marriage , not as an institution established by religious authority , but as one that happens to exist among men .

		The author begins his work with a study of the primitive family .

		The doctrine that it originated in a patriarchal aggregation is soon disposed of .

		More attention is given to the theory that in the beginning the mother was the centre and ruler of the family ; but this is also rejected .

		The author takes his stand with those who hold to the theory of original pairing .

		Far back in time , then , there was * the free choice of the man , the free consent of the woman . '

		This conclusion , however , gives rise to a multitude of problems , to some of which the author seems to provide quite sat - isfactory solutions ; but some remain and per - haps always will remain unsolved , as they take us back into times and conditions of men that were not productive of records .

		As culture advanced , however , and the idea of property arose , the status of woman was appreciably lowered .

		She became a thing of value which was often stolen and sometimes bought .

		It is wife-purchase that Professor
Howard	PERSON	finds in the earliest English source .

		But by a gradual development during the first six centuries of Anglo-Saxon history , wife - purchase gives place to self-betrothal and self - marriage .

		When the twelfth century closes , we have in
England	LOCATION	a marriage that is essentially a contract merely .

		It is not ecclesiastical , for the church does not officiate ; it is not civil , for the state does not intervene ; it is wholly private .

		And yet , all through the middle ages forces were operating that tended to make marriage an affair of the church .

		How the priest first began to participate in the nuptial ceremony by benedictions , bride-masses , and other litur - gical acts , is told clearly and fully .

		By the
thirteenth century	DATE	the development is com - pleted .

		Marriage is now held to be a sacra - ment ; a priest officiates , and the church con - trols .

		A great system of matrimonial law is being perfected by the ecclesiastical jurists : not only does the church solemnize nuptials , it also presumes to say who may and who may not enter into marriage and under what cir - cumstances the bond may be dissolved .

		Students who are in the habit of viewing the problems of marriage and divorce from a theological standpoint will find much food for reflection in the author 's presentation of the attitude assumed by the mediaeval church toward these problems .

		Also interesting is his review of the matrimonial theories held by the Protestant reformers .

		But he does not find that the ideas of the sixteenth century affected the institution in
England	LOCATION	to any appreciable extent before the nineteenth century .

		In the eyes of the law , English marriage is at present what it was in the beginning , ' a simple con - trlact ; but the state has succeeded in imposing upon it the condition of publicity -- a task which the church first attempted but failed to accomplish . '

		It will no doubt surprise many of Professor
Howard	PERSON	's readers to learn that ecclesiastical marriages in
England	LOCATION	are as recent as the thirteenth century .

		Perhaps it may also sur - prise them to learn that among the New Eng - land Puritans marriage was wholly a civil institution at which a magistrate must and a clergyman must not officiate .

		The author also finds that while in theory the Southern colo - nists looked on marriage and separation as within the jurisdiction of the church , in prac - tice they frequently permitted the local magis - trates to exercise authority in these matters , as priests and ecclesiastical courts were generally wanting .

		Matrimonial legislation in the
United States	LOCATION	since the Revolution is treated briefly and yet quite exhaustively .

		Statutes and court-deci - sions in great numbers have been examined and compared , and an extensive analysis is pre - sented which gives a full view of the practice in the different states with their similarities , differ - ences , anomalies and peculiarities , such as is probably found in no other work .

		The value of Professor
Howard	PERSON	's work lies not only in his excellent presentation of a large subject , in his sane criticism of earlier writers , or in his collection of data for the sociologist and the practical reformer ; he has added a clos - ing chapter in which he discusses the present - day problems that grow out of the family rela - tion , and makes numerous suggestions looking toward their solution .

		The chief of these is divorce .

		As there is a necessary connection between marriage and separation , their histories are told in parallel chapters .

		The author finda that in ancient times divorce was easily secured , especially by the husband .

		In general , disso - lution of marriage was looked on as a wholly private matter over which the
State	ORGANIZATION	exercised little or no control .

		Even after Christianity had become dominant in
Southern Europe	LOCATION	, and a new theory of marriage had begun to prevail , the authorities permitted divorces much as of old .

		During the middle ages , divorces became practically unknown ; the theory came to be held that la valid marriage could not be dis - 60 THE DIAL -LSB- Aagust 1 , solved , but the church had multiplied the con - ditions necessary to such a union , and any one who tired of a spouse could readily find some reason why his marriage should be annulled .

		In the modern practice the author finds much to commend and much to condemn .

		Though his attitude toward the question is a liberal one , he deplores the frequency of dissolved unions .

		But , as he views it , divorce is not necessarily an evil , it is simply the cure for bad marriages .

		This discussion shows that Profes - sor Howard 's studies have not bereft him of a healthy idealism .

		In vigorous English he pleads for higher matrimonial ideals as tiie remedy for the much-discussed divorce evil .

		The solution .

		of the problem he believes lies not so much in legislation as in education . '

		If there is to be salvation it must come though the vitalizing regenerative power of a more efficient moral , physical and social training of the young / And yet , the legislator can do much by pro- viding the proper ' legal environment . '

		Uni - form marriage and divorce laws , more general publicity , more dignity in the civil ceremony , are some of the reforms that he urges .

		As marriage is a civil institution , Professor How - ard believes that all marriages should be solemnized by a magistrate ; should the parties desire it , a clergyman might be asked to officiate later .

		But realizing the practical difficulties that such a proposal would encounter , the author suggests instead that a registrar be appointed for each locality , whose duty it should be to license and register all marriages solem - nized within his district , to solemnize marriages when a civil ceremony is desired , and to witness all nuptial ceremonies performed by a clergy - man .

		He also favors certain legal restrictions which want of space does not permit us to dis - cuss .

		As to the future of the famih ' .

		Professor
Howard	PERSON	is seemingly very optimistic .

		The situation is not so bad as we are led to imagine ; there is no cause for despair .

		But aft ^ r one has followed the story as the author tells it , one can hardly repress the question , Is this opti - mism justified ?

		Surely it is more difficult to enter into the matrimonial state to-day than in centuries past ; yet it would seem from the author 's own statistics that the practice of divorce grows continually at an alarming rate .

		Xot until the sociologist shall have traced the history of a sufficient number of divorced fam - ilies back to the period of betrothal , shall we know to what extent divorces can be attributed to bad or thoughtless marriages .

		Meanwhile Professor
Howard	PERSON	's work will be read and studied with increasing appreciation , not only by the lover of history but also by the devotee of social reform .


Laurence M. Larson	PERSON	.

		Fresh Shakespearian Studies .

		* The publication of a new book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	should be made a matter of conscience .

		Only the most urgent sense of something new and important to say can justify a writer in adding even a single item to Shakespearian bibli - ography .

		Such justification Mr.
Churton Col	PERSON	- lins unquestionably has .

		Each essay in his ' Studies in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	' is intended to illus - trate an important , and usually a neglected , principle of Shakespearian criticism .

		The first is an exhaustive presentation of the author 's favorite contention that English literature can - not be intelligently studied without reference to the classics ; the second is a protest against the recklessness of destructive criticism ; the third , an exposition of the supreme place of poetry in modern life , in accordance with Ar - nold 's well-known view in the essay on ' The Study of Poetry ' ; the sixth illustrates
Shakes	PERSON	- peare 's method of dealing with his ` sources ' ; the ninth gives the coup de grace to the ' mon - strous myth ' of Baconianism .

		The very Pre - face is evidence of the scholarly method and enormous resources that all of Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's other work has taught us to expect .

		It is proof , too , of his daring .

		Though crushed by ' the weight of the superincumbent hour , ' one 's spirit merrily rises at the challenge to German aca - demic monographs .

		We too are ' insular enough to think that , on the question of the authentici - ty of an Elizabethan drama , an English schol - ar can dispense with German lights . '

		Suffici - ently courageous also is his assurance that not only ' Titus Andronicus , ' the three parts of '
Henry VI	PERSON	. '

		and the whole of '
Henry VIII	PERSON	. '

		are the work of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but also the ' Con - tention ' and the ` True Tragedy . '

		It is quite possible that in his reaction against the destruc - tive criticism of the day , he leans slightly to the side of excessive conservatism ; but that , we think , is S'irtue 's side . '

		It requires , more - over , courage and a certain self-mortification for a reputable critic , at this time of day , to discuss Baconianism at all .

		This ` grotesque heresy ' belongs to a class to which we may apply St.
Paul	PERSON	's words , ' Let it not be once named among you . '

		But Mr.
Collins	PERSON	has other qualifications besides scholarship and courage .

		He takes criti - cism very seriously . '

		On its competence and sincerity , ' he writes , ` depends more than can be defined or estimated , for it gives the ply to the serious study of literature generally .

		Whether that study is to be facilitated or retarded , to go straight or to take wrong turns , to be fruitful or barren , -- for all this it is responsible . '

		A very different attitude is this * Studies in

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 from the ctlleUante search for novelties , the paradoxical smartness , of the critical writing with which we are too familiar .

		We may as well confess that we find it difficult to be judi - cial in dealing with a critic who is at the same time a scholar of rare excellence , who has a keen sense of the social responsibility of criti - cism , and who writes at times a style as trench - ant and distinctive as
Matthew Arnold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Time fails us to enumerate his excellences .

		He would be distinguished as a phrase-maker if he had no other critical talents .

		Fervent as his admira - tion of Shakespeare is , there is not a line in the book that suggests hysteria .

		Ardently as he maintains his various theses , nothing is more evident than that with all the candor and bal - anced judgment at his command he is not try - ing to make out a case but to arrive at the truth .

		He opens the essay on ' Shakespearian Paradoxes ' with the remark , * Sainte-Beuve has finely said that the first aim of criticism should be the discovery of truth ; ' and to this volume the remark is eminently applicable .

		He of course makes much use of the citation of par - allel passages , but with few exceptions he cites genuine parallels .

		When one perceives the use made of this device by the Baconians , one is inclined to distrust all parallelism .

		Nor arc they the only offenders ; for they can hardly outdo in audacity and fatuity some orthodox Shakespearians .

		Mr ,
Collins	PERSON	is for the most part , in this particular as in others , a model of good sense .

		Commenting on the difficulty of deciding between mere similarity of thought and actual borrowing , he says : ' Common sense and the ordinary laws of probability are perhaps as good criteria as we can have in these cases . '

		They are , as everyone knows , the last criteria usually employed .

		Moreover , the critic who undertakes to prove
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's indebt - edness to another writer because of similarity of thought or expression is too often not scholar enough to know that his conclusion is nullified by quite as significant resemblances to someone from whom he could not possibly have bor - rowed .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's resources for dealing with such a situation are ample , as the essay on * Montaigne and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	' shows .

		The first essay , ' ShaJcespeare as a Classical Scholar , ' is the most notable .

		It undertakes to prove , by an exhaustive array of parallels , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ` small Latin ' was sufficient to enable him to read
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Plautus	LOCATION	,
Seneca	LOCATION	,
Horace	PERSON	,
Juvenal	LOCATION	,
Persius	LOCATION	,
Lucretius	PERSON	, and
Cicero	PERSON	, in the original ; and Plato , the
Anthol	PERSON	- ogy , and the Greek dramatists in Latin transla - tions .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	's criticism is therefore only the classical expert 's depreciation of a scholarship that would enable the poet merely to read Latin with facility , but not to compose in it nor to deal with it critically .

		Mr.
Col	PERSON	- lins also supposes
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to have had Greek enough to give a perceptible color to his style .

		Since Farmer 's famous essay of
1766	DATE	, reprinted recently in Mr.
Nichol Smith	PERSON	's '
Eighteenth Century Essays	ORGANIZATION	on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' so extensive a claim for the poet has been practi - cally unheard of in Shakespearian criticism ; but we believe that a candid examination of Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's arguments will show that he has substantiated it .

		To be sure , not all his par - allel passages compel assent .

		` x \ daptation ' is rather a strong word for the relation of Temp. , 1.3.399-401 to
Lucretius	LOCATION	, 2.1002-1006 ; the ' undoubted reminiscences ' of
Lucretius	LOCATION	, 2.20 -

Henry V.	ORGANIZATION	and
Henry VI	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Hen	ORGANIZATION	.

		V. , 4.1 ; 3
Hen	ORGANIZATION	.

		VI. , 2.5 -RRB- seem to us highly doubtful .

		The really distinctive note of Lucretius is quite wanting , and the soliloquies merely sound the pastoral note to be heard in well-nigh every Elizabethan anthology .

		In Troil .

		and Cress. , 5.3 , where Andromache ,
Cassandra	PERSON	and Priam attempt to dissuade Hector from battle , it is by no means necessary to see a reminiscence of the ' Seven against
Thebes	LOCATION	, ' for the ultimate source of the scene is evidently the ' Roman de Troie ' of Benoit de Sainte-More , 11.15113-15525 -LRB-
Joly	PERSON	's edition -RRB- , where
Hector	PERSON	's father , mother , wife , and sisters -LRB-
Helen	PERSON	and Polyxena -RRB- plead with him in vain .

Merch	ORGANIZATION	.

		of Ven. , 5.1.64 -RRB- owes anything to the a-apKoSTrepi fioXaui of `
Hercules Mad	ORGANIZATION	, '
1269	DATE	.

		Neverthe - less , the result of a detailed inspection of the essay is conviction of its truth and of its high importance .

		It will not only prove of indis - pensable value to readers of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but it ought to be a very mine of illustration for stu - dents of the classics .

		If this essay is the most instructive in the volume , the one devoted to ' The
Bacon	PERSON	-
Shakespeare Mania	ORGANIZATION	' is naturally the most entertaining .

		It is a review of ' The Mystery of
William	LOCATION	.

		Shakespeare , ' by Judge
Webb	PERSON	, Regius Professor of Laws and Public Orator in the
University of Dublin	ORGANIZATION	, - -- such a review as ought to close the controversy if Baconians were amenable to argument or had a sense of humor .

		As Judge
Webb	PERSON	is clearly the fine flower of
Baconianism	LOCATION	, we may estimate the whole school at its best in him .

		As we read his divagations on the ' noted weed ' of the seventy-sixth Sonnet -LRB- p. 354 -RRB- , for example , we heartily agree with his reviewer in wondering ' whether such prem - ises and such reasonings were ever before heard out of establishments which it would be dis - respectful to specify . '

		Verily , as Mr.
Collins	PERSON	says , ' in dealing with Baconians , the first requi - site is resignation . '

		Anyone , whether inter - ested in the controversy or not , who wishes to read a specimen of acute reasoning , based on 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, wide and exact learning , and brightened at every turn by the sliest of witty suggestions , never ill-natured nor heavy-handed , always light , graceful , delightful , we should think , even to their victim , will do well to read this essay .

		It is a triumphant vindication of
Lord Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	's criterion of ridicule as the test of solemn absurdities .

		In the essay on ' Sophocles and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	/ Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is at his philosophic best .

		It is a parallel of too rare a
Mnd	ORGANIZATION	, a kind that demands at once more exact and more generous scholar - ship , and that in more than one field , than any but the exceptional critic can command .

		It is a study on large lines of the two great dram - atists of the world , an attempt to show how essentially alike in spirit , and even in life , they were .

		There could scarcely be a more moving plea for the comparative study of English and the classics than this admirable paper .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is , of course , not equally convincing on all points .

		There is , we think , an occasional overstatement , as , for instance , on p. 137 , where we are told that ' it may be doubted whether a sarcasm or acrimonious word ever fell from the lips of either ! '

		We venture to think that he minimizes the place of Necessity in the ' Antigone . '

		It is at least a question whether Sophocles did not intend to propound an un - solved and insoluble enigma .

		No doubt , one ought to obey God rather than men , but then the tragic d/mprux becomes a holy and necessary crime , necessary because holy , and the tragic issue is unavoidable by a God-fearing soul .

		` Antigone falls a victim to a suicidal act of audacious disobedience ' is hardly an adequate account of one of the great problem-plays of the world .

		In this essay , too , he commits him - self to an odd ethical position . '

		As we note in them both as men and artists , ' he writes on p. 141 , ` no deficiency , so we discern in them no excess ; all is balance , all is measure . '

		Yet both indulged ` fully and equally in the pleasures sought by the voluptuary and the pleasures which appeal to the finer senses and the mind . '

		Again , on p. 136 : ` In youth and middle age both were voluptuaries ... and by no poets has the terrible and degrading tyranny of mere passion been so intimately and appallingly described . '

		If we concede that the sonnets and plays are in any sense autobiographical , as we probably must , then Sonnet CXXIX .

		is doubt - less as autobiographical as any ; and if so , are ' no excess , ' ' balance , ' ' measure , ' quite the terms to apply to the life of the man who wrote it ?

		The other studies , each in its way admirable , are on the following subjects : ' Shakespearian Paradoxes , ' an attempt to restore ' Titus Andronicus ' to the canon ; ' Shakespeare as a Prose Writer ; ' ' Was Shakespeare a Lawyer ? '

		-- containing an amazing list of the legal refer - ences in the plays and poems ; '
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Holinshed	PERSON	, ' a study of the poef s use of historical material in
Macbeth	LOCATION	; ' Shakespeare and Montaigne ; ' ' The Text and Prosody of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' a plea for textual conservatism , illustrated , like all the rest , by an immense array of citations .

		One defect the volume certainly has .

		For a scholar , Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's method of referring to the plays is most unscholarly .

		He is inconsist - ent in abbreviation ; he rarely gives an exact line-reference , but alludes vaguely to a speech or passage ; when he does give a line-reference , it is frequently wrong ; and , worst of all , he misquotes passages that the vulgar also mis - quote . '

		We are such stuff as dreams are made of occurs twice -LRB- pp. 52 and 83 -RRB- ; Hamlefs ` when honor 's at the stake ' -LRB- 4.4.56 -RRB- is slightly but irritatingly mangled on p. 285 ; and Mac - beth 's ' assurance ' becomes ' doubly sure ' on p. 212 .

		In the last instance , the reference should be to Macb. , 4.1 instead of 4.2 .

		On p. 282 , Meas .

		for Meas. , 1.2 should be 1.1.30 ; on p. 303 , there is both ambiguity and error , for the reference , ` in the same play , etc. , ' is to Temp. , 5.1.58 ; on p. 30 , the reference to Cym - beline should be 3.3.77-78 ; etc. .

		Some of these errors are , no doubt , due to the proof-reading , which is inexcusably bad .

		On p. 191 , 2
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		should be 2
Henry VI	PERSON	; on p. 246 , ' impor - tant ' should evidently be unimportant ; on p. 178 , ` change and change ' should be ` chance and change ; ' on p. 254 , Banquo should be pos - sessive ; on p. 154 , '
Seward	PERSON	' should be Siward ; on p. 161 , '
Cleon	PERSON	' occurs twice for
Creon	ORGANIZATION	.

		The punctuation is highly eccentric , and the index is not complete .

		These inadvertencies are perhaps the more disconcerting because of the character of the book .

		One could wish it to be faultless ; for it is the most vivid reminder of the greatness of Shakespeare that we have read in many a day , an 'd it will send its readers to the plays them - selves , -- which , we suppose , is the end of criti - ' ^ ism .

		Plats , Acting , and Music * Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's book may fairly be termed a notable volume of criticism ; a fact all the more striking since the book is made up of articles reporting current amusement , contributed in the regular journalistic way to
London	LOCATION	papers , especially to ` The Academy . '

		One is ready enough to credit this sort of writing with read - ableness , and far too ready to avoid highly laud - atory terms regarding a critic so avowedly * Plats , Acting , and Music .

New York	LOCATION	:
B. P. Dutton A Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1904 -RSB- THE DIAL 63 individual as Mr.
Symons	PERSON	.

		But in this book Mr.
Symons	PERSON	turns out to have a sound percep - tion of beauty and its values , and wins his way doubtless all the better because his readers may have been sceptical at the outset .

		He has the air of rejecting all academic criticism ; of utter - ing his casual impressions as if they were valid because his and because casual ; of being of the mood given vogue by
Verlaine	PERSON	; of seeming , in short , a modern of the type we too defiantly call decadent .

		The habit of mind thus indi - cated is often mere pose ; it is not -- essentially , at least -- pose in Mr.
Symons	PERSON	.

		Xor does the impressionistic air serve here , as such seeming so frequently does , to cloak either wildness or dulness of critical imaginings .

		One repeats that Mr.
Sy	PERSON	mouses opinions are sound , and even -LRB- in the good sense of a word doubtless distasteful to the impressionist -RRB- academic .

		For instance , in dealing with
Duse	PERSON	,
Bernhardt	PERSON	,
Kejane	PERSON	, he does not find it necessary to fly in the face of popular approval , or even to urge that these astonishing acta'esses are liked for qualities they do not possess , and that their true virtues are hidden to the vulgar .

		In the main , he likes the qualities that are also perceptible to the man of average refinement , who could not , however , express himself so keenly or so finally .

		In other words , the glowing phrases are animated by common sense .

		But this is not to indicate that the sub - stance of these criticisms is commonplace , plus the charm of style ; Mr.
Symons	PERSON	has a fine per - ception of delicate things , an honest sense of proportion , and , as the mass of his criticism will show , he has real vision .

		The title of the book indicates the three groups into which the criticism falls , music receiving the briefest although perhaps the most inter ^ ting treatment .

		It is the continental stage , -- plays and actors , -- rather than the English , which most concerns Mr.
Symons	PERSON	; and not unnaturally , for few would care to doubt the current English inferiority in this regard , and it is characteristic of this critic to prefer to talk of the best things .

		Not that he scorns the Bnglish-spealcing stage , as it is our wholly uncritical fashion to do , but that he can dis - criminate between good and better , as witness this searching comment : ' Irving represents the old school of acting , just as
Duse	ORGANIZATION	represents the new school .

		To
Duse	PERSON	, act - ing is a thing almost wholly apart from action ; she thinks on the stage , scarcely moves there ; when she feels emotion , it is her chief care not to express it with emphasis , but to press it down Into her soul , until only the pained reflection of it glimmers out of her eyes and trembles in the hollows of her cheeks .

		To Irving , on the contrary , acting is all that the word literally means ; it is an art of sharp , detached , yet always delicate , movements ; he crosses the stage with intention , as he intentionally adopts a fine , crabbed , personal , highly conventional elocution of his own ; he is an actor , and he acts , keeping nature , or the too close resemblance of nature , carefully out of his com - position .

		With Miss
Terry	PERSON	there is only the per - sonal charm of a very natural nature , which has become deliciously sophisticated .

		She is the eter - nal girl , and she can never grow old ; one mfght say , she can never grow up .

		She learns her part , taking it quite artificially , as a part to be learnt ; and then , at her frequent moments of forgetful - ness , charms us into delight , though never into conviction , by a gay abandonment to the self of a passing moment . '

		One may agree or differ , but in either event will doubtless think that this is carefully-writ - ten , carefully-composed criticism , and that it has behind it keen observation and high ideals of art .

		Genuine insight is constantly apparent in the volume , and perhaps nowhere more clearly -LRB- in the comments on the theatre -RRB- than in the discussions of
Bemhardt	LOCATION	's Phedre and of
Eejane	LOCATION	's
Zaza	LOCATION	, -- not brought together in the book , but worth while setting side by side here : ' R ^ jane can be vulgar , as nature is vulgar : she has all the instinct of the human animal , of the animal woman , whom man will never quite civil - ise ... More than any other actress she is the human animal without disguise or evasion ; with all the instincts , all the natural cries and movements ... Scepticism is no longer possible : the thing is before you , abominably real , a dis - quieting and irrefutable thing , which speaks with its own voice , as it has never spoken on the stage through any other actress . ' '

		The passion of Phfidre ... is an abnormal , an insane thing , and that passion comes to us with all its force and all its perversity ; but the words in which it is expressed are never extrav - agant , they are always clear , simple , temperate , perfectly precise and explicit .

		The art is an art exquisitely balanced between the conventional and the realistic , and the art of
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	, when she plays the part , is balanced with the same unerring skill .

		She seems to abandon herself wholly , at times , to her `` fureurs '' ; she tears the words with her teeth , and spits them out of her mouth , like a wild beast ravening upon prey ; but there is always dignity , restraint , a certain remote - ness of soul , and there is always the verse , and her miraculous rendering of the verse , to keep
Racine	LOCATION	in the right atmosphere .

		Of what we call acting there is little , little change in the expression of the face .

		The part is a part for the voice , and it is only in '' Phfidre '' that one can bear that orches - tra , her voice , in all its variety of beauty . '

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's comments on music are dis - tinctly worth quoting .

		Their suggestiveness is of the better sort , that which shows the relation - ship of a new work to fundamental criteria ; not the poorer suggestiveness which finds its outlet in undeliberated epigram or sensational com - parison .

		This , of Tschaikowsky , for example , is worth thinking about : ' In your delight at finding anyone so alive , you are inclined to wel - * 4 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, come him without reserve , and to forget that a man of genius is not necessarily a great artist , and iiiat , if he is not a great artist , he is not a satisfactory man of genius . '

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's _ notion that
Pachmann	PERSON	is the greatest living piai ; ii , st may not find w ^ ide acceptance , but it is based upon the conviction that such praise is deserved by one who ' can play certain things better than any other pianist can play anything . '

		The ' certain things ' are
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's , of course , and
Pachman	PERSON	's playing ` gives you pure music , not states of soul or of temperament , not inter - pretations , but echoes .

		* * * I do not think he has ever put an intention into
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ Chopin had no intentions . '

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's deiiunciation of a hybrid art-form , the mingling of music and spoken words , may possibly find some response now that we are by way of hear - ing that ` would-be artistic creation , '
Strauss	PERSON	's setting of
Enoch Arden	PERSON	.

		There can be but little doubt • of the utter correctness of the critic 's position .

		Enough has been quoted to indicate the qual - ity of Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's criticism , its independence and usual sanity .

		Its fluency is the fluency of ideas rather than of words .

		If occasionally one hesitates in agreement , it is from the feeling that now and then the auithor resents the inevit - ableness of logic when it is opposed to the tempting thrill of momentary impression .


Martin Sampson	PERSON	.

		Religious Freedom .

		* About 273 years ago ,
John Cotton	ORGANIZATION	and others established in
Boston	LOCATION	a series of lectures , delivered every
Thursday	DATE	, in which matters relating to the spiritual and physical well-being of the community were discussed .

		These came to be known as the ' Great and
Thursday	DATE	Lec - tures , ' and have been given almost without a break down to the present day .

		Last year , with the cooperation of the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	, there was delivered a series of lectures on religious liberty in
America	LOCATION	as illustrated by the lives of those who did most to further the cause .

		These lectures have now been gathered together , and issued in the form of a book .

		It is worth while to enumerate the headings of the chapters , in order to show who the * pioneers ' were and what they were thought to especially stand for : -- I. ,
William Brewster	PERSON	and the Independents ; II. ,
Roger Williams	PERSON	and his Doctrine of Soul Liberty ; III. ,
Thomas Hooker	PERSON	and the
Principle of Congregational * Pioneers of Religious Liberty	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		Edited by
Samuel A. Eliot	PERSON	.

		Boston :
American Unitarian Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation , Religious Freedom in
American Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Joseph Henry Crooker	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		, , ^ Independency ; IV. ,
William Penn	LOCATION	and the Gos - pel o # the Inner Light ; V. ,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	and the Influence of Democracy upon Religion ; VI. ,
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	and the
Growth of Spiritual Christianity	ORGANIZATION	; VII. ,
Horace Bush	PERSON	- nell and Progressive Orthodoxy ; VIII. ,
Hosea Ballon	PERSON	and the Larger Hope ; IX. ,
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	and the Doctrine of the Divine Immanence ; X. ,
Theodore Parker	PERSON	and the Naturalisration of Religion ; XL ,
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	and the
Unity of the Spirit	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lectures are naturally rather unequal in merit , but the recital of the thoughts and deeds of the eleven men enumerated could hardly be otherwise than inspiring .

		Regarding the some - what broken narrative as a whole , we see the early struggle for physical freedom , -- the right not merely to think , but to act and speak in accordance with the inner light .

		Said
Roger Williams	PERSON	in
1631	DATE	, ' The civil sword may make a nation of hypocrites and anti-Christians , but not one Christian ... Persons may with less sin be forced to marry whom they can not love than to worship where they can not believe . '

		Liberty achieved in outward form , the struggle was followed by a period of calm , and it was half forgotten that there was anything to struggle for .

		The
State Church	ORGANIZATION	was established in the land , and dogma stood for religion .

		A barrier had been raised up , it could not be improved away , and the alternative of revolu - tion remained .

		Who will doubt that this nation came into being as much from a psychological as a physical necessity ?

		So it followed that
Jeiferson	PERSON	and
Channing	PERSON	,
Bushnell	PERSON	and
Ballon	LOCATION	, stood for the freedom of the mind , and inde - pendent churches came into being .

		In the time that followed , man 's mental horizon was broad - ened by science , and new adjustments became necessary .

		It seemed to many an earnest soul that the foundations of belief were sapped , and the expansion permitted by freedom had con - verted what was once solid into mere nebulosity .

		Yet there were some who understood , and thus came forward the prophets of modern times , whose voices still ring in our ears .

		In all of this , directive purpose seems strangely combined with streaks of perversity , -- blind alle \ & of thought , as it were .

		Our poor old human race moves more like a man in the dark than an athlete running for a prize .

		Yet we go forward , and do not doubt that the prize is waiting , though we have no very clear idea what it is .

		In the lecture on
Emerson	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 321 , 323 -RRB- , Dr.
Peabody	PERSON	quotes and criticises a statement of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	's that , ' If Christianity be true at all , it would be just as true if Herod or Catiline had taught it . '

		It is _ very justly objected , that the supposition itself is an absurd - ity ; but the idea did not originate with
Parker	PERSON	,
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 for long ago Luther wrote ' the book which preaches Christ is apostolic , were its author Judas ,
Annas	PERSON	,
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	, or Herod . '

		Dr.
Crocker	PERSON	, in his work on ' Eeligious Free - dom in
American Education	ORGANIZATION	' presents an analysis land discussion of the educational insti - tutions of this country in their relation to relig - ious dogma .

		The book is that of a propagandist , not that of a scientific student .

		Dr.
Crooker	PERSON	is of course opposed to any sort of union .

		of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, and says : ' That is the best arrangement , for all interests and institutions , which keeps the
Public School	ORGANIZATION	close to its special work and frees it from all other responsibilities , which commits religious instruc - tion to those who are called of God to give it , and which leaves the
Bible	LOCATION	to make its way into the heart , not by compulsion and formality , but along the lines of persuasion which center in home and church ' -LRB- p. 82 -RRB- .

		Then , as to the teaching of morals , -- . '

		Shall , then , our Public Schools teach a for - mal moral code ?

		No , rather let them possess a moral atmosphere derived from the personality of the teacher ... Place a
Horace Mann	PERSON	or a
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	in a school-room , and that school will possess more moral power than resides in all the ethical handbooks in the whole world ' -LRB- p. 45 -RRB- .

		Very well , but how about the quality of the teachers we have ?

		We are told , -- • ' In intelligence , singleness of purpose , purity of life , there is not a priesthood in the world that outranks them ; and there are few that equal them .

		Is it not a frightful slander to call our Public Schools irreligious , when , in fact , they are taught by as noble and saintly a band of workers as ever consecrated themselves to the service of human - ity ? '

		-LRB- p. 35 . -RRB-

		Positively , we begin to feel a little dizzy .

		Extremes sometimes meet , and it is fair to ask whether , in our undoubtedly righteous zeal for non-sectarian schools , we may not sometimes leave our children totally at the mercy of bigots on the one hand , or hard-hearted materialism on the other .

		A great part of the purpose of education is to .

		put the child in the possession of the ripest fruits of the mental travail of the race ; and if anyone believes that that can be done without referring to religion , he strangely misconceives both history and the human mind .

		To leave the child to ` those called of God , ' according to their own designation , is frequently to leave him to narrow , warped , or misleading teachers ; and if any sectarian feels injured by this statement , I beg him to consider that it refers not to his sect , but to all others .

		The exclusion of dogma from the schools , and the search for noble teachers , -- these are aims worthy of all support ; but when we get the right men and women , let us not curtail their freedoui , nor prevent them from freely impart - ing the fruits of their own spiritual develop - ment .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		Briefs of New Books .

		w h - t ' ^ ^ '
Washington	LOCATION	's ` Working gospel of Taboj ^ '' '' '' ^ with the Hands ' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a logical and satisfactory sequel to his ` Up from Slavery . '

		At first thought , the new book seems to add little to the autobiography ; it re-affirms the ` gospel of hard work with head and hands , ' and it retells the story of Tus - kegee , only with more detail .

		But in final analysis it proves to go farther .

		` Up from Slavery ' explained the man and stated his theo - rem ; ` Working with the Hands ' gives the dem - onstration , full in fact and experience , and states the far-reaching corollaries .

		Nor will any of us who believe in the ` worth of work with the hands as an uplifting power in real education ' weary of learning how that power has been exemplified at
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, in farm and wagon-shops , brick-yard and foundry , class-room , laboratory , and kitchen , until the community has become not only almost self-equipj > ed , but as elevated in tone , compara - tively , as Brook Farm itself .

		The book is rightly called ` Working with the Hands ' rather than ` The Story of Tuskegee . '

		The principle is much larger than the institution , and the author tells something of its wider application .

		How far he himself , following
General Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	's lead , has stimulated the impulse toward manual training in all education ,
North and South	LOCATION	, it is aside from his modesty to say , even if he could .

		But he realizes and insists upon the economic and political importance of his work .

		` It was this training of the hands , ' he says , ` that furnished the first basis for united and sympathetic inter - est and action between the two races at the South , and the whites at the North and those at the South . '

		He calls attention to the fact that the industries of
Porto Rico	LOCATION	,
Hayti	LOCATION	, and parts of
Africa	LOCATION	, are being transformed by men trained at Tuskegee ; and he believes that moral and relig - ious transformation will follow the economic .

		` After diligent investigation , ' he says , ' I have been unable to find a dozen former students in idleness .

		They are busy in schoolroom , field , shop , home , or church .

		They are busy because they have placed themselves in demand by learn - ing to do that which the world wants done , and because they have learned the disgrace of idle - ness and the sweetness of labor . '

		The lover of mankind , and of poetry , can not help dreaming of what life and literature will be like , when the Man with the Hoe -- the man ' dead to rapture and despair , A - thing that grieves not and that never hopes , ' shall have been replaced by the man Mr.
Wash	PERSON	- ington is training , whose hand , head , and heart are educated in service , and who knows the sweet - ness and dignity of labor .

		The course of empire . '

		Small satisfaction will come to the idealist from the reading of Mr.
Archibald R.Colquhoun	PERSON	's ' Greater America ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In all but its concluding chapters , which are in the nature of prophecy , it is a history of the expansion of the republic , 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, from the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	to the purchase of the Filipinos and their archipelago .

		The au - thor shows that nowhere have any considerations other than those of material interest been per - mitted to stand in the way of the acquisition of empire , from
Jefferson	PERSON	's extra-constitutional negotiations with the first
Napoleon	PERSON	, through the Mexican War , to the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	by which the
Philippines	LOCATION	were brought under the flag but not under the constitution .

		He is convinced that
Cuba	LOCATION	will fall into our laps , like a ripened cocoa - nut ; he considers the annexation of
Mexico	LOCATION	and the Central American republics possible ; he weighs the chances of bringing the Canadian provinces into the sisterhood of states , and the thought of drawing the southern line of ' greater
America	LOCATION	' at the river
Amazon	LOCATION	after extending it to the
North Pole	LOCATION	is rather a serious one with him .

		The islands of the
Caribbean	LOCATION	are taken up one by one , and their future settled , with the pos - sibilities of the Dutch West Indies coming into the hands of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The government of the
United States	LOCATION	is explained in detail for the bene - fit of his British readers , as the administration of the Indian empire is detailed for Americans .

		The problems of expansion are considered in the light of these two systems , and the Filipino is set down as incapable of self-government from any American point of view , with a smile for those who would disregard the teachings of history in the tropics .

		A larger navy is insisted upon , as
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	can not con - sent to the overthrow of
Japan	LOCATION	as a naval factor in the balance of power necessary to progress on the farther shores of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		The book is frankly materialistic in its point of view , and is calculated to delight the hearts of all true im - perialists .

		Needless to say , it does not set forth the final historical fact that imperial nations have uniformly gone down into the abysses of history , while only those , like
China	LOCATION	, which have been steady advocates of peace , have been long able to survive .

		While the world is waiting for theatatetman Lord Kowton to publish the long - expected full and satisfactory life of the man he so devotedly served as secretarj ' ^ , various writers , without his qualifications and resources for the task , give us from time to time their accounts , now fragmentary and now more nearly complete , of that remarkable career .

		In a small volume about as large as one of our * Beacon Biographies , ' Mr.
Walter Sichel	PERSON	pre - sents an outline of Disraeli 's public life , briefly naming his book ' Beaconsfield ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Hav - ing already treated his subject from another point of view in his * Disraeli : A Study in Per - sonality and Ideas , ' the author now devotes his attention to
Lord Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	's political career .

		From the first he shows himself a thorough-going admirer of the brilliant statesman .

		Accordingly the less admirable traits of his character are either left undelineated or are but faintly sug - gested .

		Only the briefest reference is made to the famous squabble with
O'Connell	PERSON	, and there is no mention of the altercation with
Joseph Himie	PERSON	.

		To readers not having something like a professional love for the details of English polit - ical history , -- the ups and downs of reform move - ments , the perpetual clashing of parties , the fate of this , that , or the other bill in
Parliament	LOCATION	, -- the book will seem somewhat of a twice-told tale , so often has its subject-matter been handled by previous writers .

		Touching on our own Civil War and his country 's attitude in the matter , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	voices a probably erroneous impres - sion when he says , ' The natural sympathies of the nation ... were with the South . '

		That the English people as a whole espoused the pro- slavery cause , has long been regarded as more than doubtful .

		Indeed , some convincing evi - dence of the right-mindedness of the English press at the time has recently been published , as the reader may remember .

		For a handy outline , agreeably illustrated with a dozen portraits and other views , this little book is to be commended .

		The study of In view of the present celebration government of the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	and the in
Wyoming	LOCATION	, projected memorial of the travels of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	next year .

		Dr.
Grace Raymond Hebard	PERSON	's book on ` The Government of Wyom - ing ' -LRB-
Whitaker & Ray	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comes very opportunely to remind us of the unique position of that state as being embraced in all the four large cessions of land west of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Hebard	PERSON	has the faculty of writing very lucidly and interest - ingly about what is too often deemed ` too dry ' a subject .

		An excellent chronological table makes clear the various stages in the formation of the territory and its subsequent development , and the historical portions of the book are very acceptable .

		Its chief interest lies , of course , in what concerns its government .

		As an attorney - at-law , the author possesses the equipment needed to make the chapters on
Administration and Justice	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as explaining the legal steps from arrest to conviction or acquittal in civil and crimi - nal cases -RRB- instructive and helpful .

		Other timely topics are the chapters discussing the constitu - tional conventions and the convention which led to Statehood , the Australian ballot-system intro - duced in the State by the author 's brother , the elective franchise , the land-boards , the irriga - tion laws , and the benefits of forest resei ` ves -LRB- of particular interest to the ` arid ' West -RRB- , -- a range of topics of more than local interest , use - ful and necessary to all classes .

		The errors are few , and only such as might slip in unawares into any book ; while a list of questions and references at the end of each chapter , good illustrations , ma ^ s , and appendices , besides a complete index , make the volume a very satisfactory contribu - tion to our scant literature on this subject .

		The study of government in
Wyoming	LOCATION	has not hith - erto been aided by a satisfactory text-book .

		This little volume is cordially recommended as a handy reference-book for libraries where this j > ortion of our history is not often adequately represented .

		Revelations of One reads with pleasure that military life in Lieutenant Bilse , author of '
Aus Germany	LOCATION	.

		einer kleinen
Garnison	PERSON	, ' has been released from the military sentence of imprison - ment inflicted on him for writing his book , which
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 contained in the form of fiction the severest of criticisms upon the conduct of officers of the German military establishment in times of peace -- by telling the truth about them .

		His book , it may be remembered , resulted in a gen - eral inquiry on the part of the German Emperor into his most highly favored national institution , the result of which was so far confirmatory of the things described that the old and barbarous rule of English law , ' the greater the truth the greater the libel , ' must be in force in
Germany	LOCATION	, at least among the military .

		Mr.
Wolf von Sehierbrand	PERSON	has translated the story into Eng - lish , with the title of * A Little Garrison ' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , providing it with an introduction in which he sets forth these facts , telling his read - ers that he was obliged to suppress some of the episodes in it as too strong for American read - ing .

		Those remaining tend to show that , with notable exceptions , the German officer is a moral coward , a bully , a thief , a liar , a petty swin - dler , a gambler , an absconder , a drunkard , a liber - tine , and several other unpleasant things .

		This is in times of peace ; in times of war , as Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has noted , he is a hero .

		The problem appears to be to force a man who is taught as a matter of professional duty to disregard during a time of war every law , human and divine , prescribed for good conduct , to observe all those laws when it has not been made permissible for him to become a chartered murderer , thief , liar , and the rest .

		It is not stated in just those terms by Mr.
von Sehierbrand	PERSON	, Lieutenant Bilse , or the commenta - tors on the book at home or abroad ; and , so stated , it does not appear to be a problem capable of easy solution .

		The one remedy likely to be efficacious would seem to be the discouragement of the military spirit .


Germany	LOCATION	, however , is little likely to do this .

Queen Wilhelmina	LOCATION	, one of her most interesting characters , she gives noth - ing at all that savors of personal impression .

		Her style lacks simplicity and restraint ; all things wear a glamor of romance to her view , and everj ' situation must yield its bit of sentiment and poetry .

		She is a poet , and insists on remain - ing one even in her prose .

Reed	PERSON	's descrip - tions of the birds themselves , which cover practically all the spjecies on the continent -- nearly eight hundred -- are not full enough to be of much value for purposes of iden - tification , but are intended only to introduce the fuller descriptions of nests and e ^ s .

		As Mr.
Reed	PERSON	says , ` The greatest interest in the study of birds centres in their home-life ' ; and his purpose is to add to popular knowledge on this subject .

		He does not wish to stimulate the indiscriminate collecting of birds ' eggs , but recognizes the fact that ` knowledge does not imply possession , ' and that the collector is one of the enemies of bird-life .

		Except in the cases of sub-species that deviate only slightly from the type , life-size drawings of the eggs are given , showing shape and markings with minute fidelity .

		These cuts are in black-and-white , but the colors are carefully described , so that the record is complete .

		It is an interesting novelty in bird - literature to find the illustrations of eggs given in full on the page , while thumb-nail sketches of the birds appear in the margin .

		To most readers , the seventy additional illustrations , most of them full-page , showing nests and their surroundings , will appeal as the most interesting feature of the book , -- so interesting , in fact , as to make the book worth while if it had no other value .

		The literary critic will wince a little , however , at see - ing these beautiful pictures labeled ` photos , ' and at frequent awkward espressions in the text .

		A distinguished
Russia	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	and the
United Englishwoman States	LOCATION	have each furnished some of Science .

		Ulustrious names to the list of women who have achieved fame in the fields of pure or applied science , but not many have found the British environment conducive to this result .

		An exception , however , must be made in the case of Miss
Eleanor Ormerod	PERSON	,
England	LOCATION	's most noted economic entomologist .

		That her fame was not merely a local one is evidenced by the array of eminent correspondents in all civilized lands and some far corners of the earth who have contrib - uted to her ` Autobiography and Correspondence ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This has been edited and coinpiled by Professor
Robert Wallace	PERSON	of the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	, of which institution she was the first woman honorary graduate .

		Her correspondence , here published for the first time , will be of espe -
68	DATE	.

		THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, eial interest to all economic entomologists .

		The moderation and eminent good-sense which charac - terized her ` Annual Reports ' -LRB- 1877-1898 -RRB- won for her a high place in the esteem of her co-work - ers throughout the world .

		Her services to the
Royal Agricultural Society	ORGANIZATION	and the Royal Agri - cultural College , and in behalf of agricultural education , were given freely and ungrudgingly , and may yet bear fruit when
England	LOCATION	awakens to the fact that science , even applied entomology , has its place in the schedules of the modem uni - versity .

		The extensive correspondence and abun - dant illustrations give a technical value to the book for the specialist , and the story of this use - ful and successful life should be inspiration to others who have similar means and leisure for a scientific career .

		Mr.
Henry W. Nevinson	PERSON	, known to ST ; ^ the literary world as war corre - spondent of ' The Daily Chron - icle ' and author of * Ladysmith : the Diary of a Siege , ' and other books , has turned his South - African and other professional experiences to ac - count in a collection of miscellanies , mostly fic - tion , entitled ' Between the Acts ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Four of the stories have to do with
Boers	PERSON	and Kaffirs , kraals and kopjes , and like things and persons .

		Nevertheless , despite the abundance of local color , the tales are not always convincing , as , for example , when , in a besieged and starv - ing village , a hen not only figures in a thriving condition , without visible means of support , but even achieves the laying of an egg \ Two stories of university life , one at
Jena	PERSON	, the other at Ox - ford , are somewhat amusingly burlesque .

		Two autobiographical chapters , one Greco-Turkish war story , one slum story , two love stories , one journalist 's tale , and one Spanish sketch , with a bit of verse at the end of each , complete the volume .

		Some of the poems are graceful , occa - sionally attaining a neatness that is almost epi - grammatic , and a few of the stories are ingenious ; but the book will hardly place the author on that * pinnacle of fame ' which gives the title of his concluding chapter .

		The beautiful downs of Sussex are g '' sTex a treasure-house of English his - tory .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's ' Highways and Byways in Sussex ' -LRB- Ma < 5millan -RRB- reveals the instinct of the archaeologist , the historian , and the litterateur .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	wandered aloilg the chalk cliffs , over the downs , up the little river valleys , and among the ruins of ancient glory , with open eyes and mind .

		Churchyards , castles , groves , hedgerows , and villages , all told him stories which he has incorporated in this volume .

		Seventy-six well-executed sketches of buildings , landscapes , groves , parks , and street scenes , by Mr. ¥ .


L. Griggs	PERSON	, add to the vividness of the nar - rative .

		A good map of
Sussex	LOCATION	, with its cities , towns , rivers , downs , and highways , helps the reader in his trips across country with his guide .

		BRIEFER MENTION 94 NOTES : ... 94 THi : QUESTION OF SECONDARY ED UCAT ION .

		The problem of the secondary school is well to the foreground in current educational dis - cussion , both in this country and in
Eiigland	LOCATION	, and the fact that its importance is thus gen - erally realized constitutes one of tihe most encouraging signs of the educational times .

		Its prominence is emphasized Just now by the pub - lication of a full stenographic report of the proceedings of the
National Conference on Secondary Education	ORGANIZATION	and Its Problems , held at the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	last
October	DATE	, and attended by representative high-school men from all parts of the country .

		This report ranks high among the educational documents of recent years , and makes reading of an excep - tionally interesting sort .

		The main objects of the conference are stated in the following terms : ' It was intended that the conference should be quite different from the ordinary teachers ' conven - tion or association called to discuss purely peda - gogical questions in the narrow sense .

		It did not purpose to deal with the problem of teaching arith - metic or algebra or Latin or Greek , nor with the best methods of integrating the branches of study which constitute the curriculum , nor was it to dis - cuss the respective merits of the classics and mod - ern languages or natural science as means of literary culture .

		It was decided to leave all such questions relating to pedagogy in the n & rrow sense of the term to one side , and concentrate the inter - est of the conference upon what may be called the broader elements of educational statesmanship involved in the organization of a national system of secondary education . '

		, The general trend of the discussion thus determined , it remained to fix upon the specific subjects to be taken up , and they were finally grouped under the following heads : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The function of the private school .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The func - tion of the public high school .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The sys - tem of accrediting schools by universities .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Moral and religious training .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Defects of our high school system .

		The questions raised by these subjects ' go to the very root of our social and educational life , ' as President
James	PERSON	suggested in his call for the conference , and their discussion developed a line of argument which seems , in the reading , noteworthy for its general ability and breadth of view .

		Before taking up these topics separately , we must call attention to the opening address on ' The Present Situation in Secondary Educa - tion , ' made by Mr.
Alfred E. Stearns	PERSON	of the
Phillips Andover Academy	ORGANIZATION	, because it set what politicians call a ` keynote ' for the ensuing debates , and started the conference upon the highest possible plane .

		This address first emphasizes the plastic characters of the years from twelve to twenty , and asserts the para - mount necessity of giving a wise and firm direc - tion to the work of students .

		The danger of an early specialization is thus set forth : ' The youth who enters the high school or academy is altogether too apt to be concerned , not 78 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 16	DATE	'' with the mental training and discipline which the secandary school should furnish , but merely with those individual subjects which he believes will serve his chosen end ... The sound and thor - ough drill , the well-rounded training which would best fit him to meet the special demands of his later calling , whatever that calling may be , these are spurned as old-fashioned , or at least as of no practical value to him . '

		These are words of wisdom , spoken in an age which is witnessing the steady demoraliza - tion of high-school courses by their presentation of an elective system to minds too immature to make an intelligent choice .

		Significant also in the highest degree is what Mr.
Steams	PERSON	says of the failure of the modem home to co-operate with the school in its work . '

		The decadence of a normal and healthy family life in
America	LOCATION	, and with it that sound and sensible home training which in the past has been one of the greatest sources of the strength of the Republic , presents a situation which has well aroused the anxiety of thoughtful men .

		It is hard to exaggerate this deplorable condition , and nowhere are its evils more clearly recognized than in the secondary school ... Pitiable in the extreme is the lot of the child of parents of wealth and influence .

		Business and professional demands for the one , and exacting social requirements for the other , render it impossible for the father or mother to give to the developing character of the child the thought and guidance that is any child 's birthright .

		... Nor is this condition confined to the chil - dren of the rich alone .

		It will be found in an increasing degree in almost all classes of society , among men of intellect as well as among men of money ; and one of the most pathetic features of the situation lies in the fact that men who owe their success in life to the struggle and discipline of their youthful days persist in denying to their children those very conditions and opportunities by which their own success was made possible . '

		Discussion of the first general topic on the list , the function of the private school , was mainly in the hands of speakers who are engaged in directing such institutions , and they naturally said what they could in sup - port of that method of education .

		And there is much , no doubt , that can fairly be said in behalf of the private school .

		As compared with the public school , it frequently offers a better system of management , a closer attention to the needs of the individual , and more efficient instruction .

		But the thing that ought to be emphasized upon every such occasion as this , and that was not properl -RCB- ^ emphasized at the EVanstion conference , is the principle that the community has no more imperative duty than that of making the public school distinctly better than any private institution .

		This may seem a counsel of perfection , but it sets a goal toward which we should constantly strive .

		In many communities it is a condition fully real - ized ; it should bo realized in all the others .

		For nothing is more vital to the preservation of democracy than that the children of all classes should mingle with each other at school upon a common footing of equality .

		Class distinc - tions are more out of place in education than anywhere else , and to .

		give the slightest coun - tenance to the notion that the public schools are for the children of the poor only is to work the most insidious and lasting harm to the social healii .

		About the poorest sort of citizen in any community is the one who gradges the few dollars per pupil that are expended upon the public schools , while willingly paying hun - dreds of dollars apiece for the education of his own children in private academies .

		The speakers who had for their topic the function of the public high school kept their discussion , for the most part , at a high philo - sophical level .

		The mean view of that function , which would have the school provide what its childish constituents want , or think they want , instead of providing what professional educa - tors know they ought to have , found occasional expression , but the principal weight of the argu - ment was on tlie right side , and kept close to the essentials .

		In these days of reckless educational experimentation , it is refreshing to hear such words of plain and sober truth as these of Pro- fessor Boodin of
Iowa	LOCATION	College : * It seems to me that our ancestors builded wiser than they knew , that the old course of the
New England	LOCATION	grammar school , as thus modernized , com - plies on the whole with the rational idea of educa - tion , and furnishes at least a working basis , whereas the elective system is the mere absence of an ideal , frivolity run mad . '

		Tlie topic of the accrediting system devel - oped a considerable body of opinion in favor of the admission to the university , without examination , of the graduates of well-equipped high schools .

		One speaker stated that ' the accrediting system gives the college students with a better average preparation , ' and pre - sented some statistics which strikingly support that position .

		There was practically no dissent from the general approval bestowed upon this method of determining the fitness of students to enter college , and the subject , not lending itself to controversy , was so speedily disposed of that the later speakers began to wander into other fields , and notably into that contentious area where the question of moral and religious instruction is debated .

		When it was pointed out that this was to be the subject for the open - ing discussion on the day following , the con - ference adjourned , to listen that evening to an extremely interesting address , albeit a trifle incoherent and eccentric , by Mr ,
Henr	PERSON	-RCB- '
S. Bou	PERSON	- tell , who spoke upon the public high school as the training-school of good citizenship .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		79 When the conference met for its second day 's work , the topic of moral and religious training was taken np for serious treatment .

		Somewhat to our surprise , considering the auspices under which the conference was held , the discussion resulted , on the whole , in a pronouncement against such training as a specific exercise , although , of course , much stress was laid upon the moral and religious elements that are inher - ent in all good tieaching and orderly discipline .

		Professor Doan , of the
Ohio University	ORGANIZATION	, opened the discussion with a combination of acute analysis and convincing argument which de - serves very high praise .

		He thus describes the danger of placing any text of formal ethics in the hands of the child . '

		Perhaps the child will learn its headings and paragraphs by rote .

		Yet if there is any one time and any one discipline wherein rote-learning is a harren waste it is the ethical discipline of adoles - cence .

		Or else the pupil will be made too intro - spective .

		Yet during the period of adolescence with its emotional instability introspection should be avoided as a moral or spiritual pestilence . '

		Other speakers , among them Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	and Dr.
Tompkins	PERSON	, added the weight of their experience and judgment to the argument against a set form of training in these matters , and Professor
Folwell	PERSON	helped to clear the air by a few plain blunt words : ' I have a right to send my children to the schools for school work , to have them let alone in their religion .

		As for morals , I do not care as a teacher for an opportunity to stand up and tell my pupils that honesty is a good thing , or that virtue is a good thing .

		I do want an opportunity to let those students see that I am a square man , that I do not deceive , that my word is good , that what I am to-day I will be tomorrow .

		That is the opportunity for the teacher -- to lead a true , square life before the student .

		I do not care for any opportunity to talk '' goody '' to a student .

		My last word is that when we shall simply keep school as school ought to be kept , we shall be giving the best moral instruction possible . '

		To this general trend of the discussion , there were , of course , some voices raised in dissent , and some outbursts of bigotry .

		One speaker said that ' only persons who reverence God and show that reverence in their lives should be appointed to any teaching position . '

		He then went on to say that he was broad-minded enough to approve of Catholics , Protestants , and Jews , an admission which elicited from one of the following speakers an energetic pro- test against the fitness of a Jew to be a school - teacher in a ' Christian nation . '

		But these exhibitions , lamentable as they are , do not detract very much from the value of the dis - cussion , which , as a whole , took the right direc - tion and reached the right conclusions .

		The ' serious defects in our high school sys - tem ' which came up for consideration in the closing hours of the conference proved to be the too great preponderance of woman teachers in our schools , a fact so evident that it hardly needs to be emphasized ; the ways in which social life and unfortunate home conditions interfere with serious study , ways which we all know to be perplexingly nimierous ; and the bad influence of school societies , which is probably far from being as bad as it is made out to be .

		Under the chapter of ' defects , ' many other matters might have been brought forward , and some of more consequence than those touched upon .

		There happens to lie before us at this moment the report of one of the members of the
Mosely Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and we read in it these words : ' Unless the Americans desire to stereo - type all teaching , they must be prepared to grant almost absolute freedom to their teachers . '

		Here is a glance at a defect of our system far more radical than any that came up in the con - ference at
Evanston	LOCATION	.

		We offer the suggestion merely to indicate a better use that might have been made of that closing hour , since the immi - nent close of our remarks makes impossible any discussion of so vastly important a subject .

		It is appropriate to add , after this summary of one of the most valuable educational docu - ments of recent years , that the occasion of the conference whose proceedings are now pub - lished was the completion by Dr.
Herbert Franklin Fisk	PERSON	of thirty years of service as prin - cipal of the
N'orthwestern University Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work thus becomes , not only an important contribution to current educaitional thought , but also a deserved personal tribute to a man whose lifelong devotion to the work of secondary teaching has been to an unusual degree fruitful and inspiring .

		LITTERA
SCRIPT A. Littera	ORGANIZATION	scripta manet might serve as text for many a discourse on the terrible inexorability of the past -- past deeds , past words , past thoughts even , which no utmost urgency of prayerful entreaty or unstinted flow of repent - ant tears can recall or annul .

		The endless agony of unavailing remorse that may follow a momen - tary act of innocent or even virtuous intent is one of those things that , like the mystery of sin to which it is in fact closely allied , perplex and baffle us the more we grope for an explana - tion and seek to apply a remedy .

		Without dwelling , however , on the graver applications of this pithy proverb , it is proposed here to adduce some of the less harrowing , but perhaps not less instructive , while certainly more amusing , illustrations of its truth as found in the pitiless permanence of the written , or rather the printed , 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, `` vyord , -- its obstinate and often highly vexa - tious refusal to be expunged or forgotten .

		Other matters suggested by this tyranny of the letter may also find appropriate mention before we close .

		It is now nearer three hundred than two hundred years ago that the reading world of
England	LOCATION	, and more especially of
London	LOCATION	, was witness to a rather heated theologica .1 dispute known in ecclesiastical -LRB- and literary history as the Smectymnuan controversy .

		In
March , 1641	DATE	,
Bishop Hall	PERSON	published his ' Humble Eemon - strance ' in defense of Episcopacy against the onslaughts of dissenters .

		To this there appeared , two months later , an answer written by ten anti-Episcopalians , who signed them - selves collectively * Smectymnuus / from the initial letters of their names , the uii standing for w .

		These collaborating pamphleteers , with all their pride of learning and imposing array of argument and citation of authorities , bad in an unguarded moment been guilty of what to a classical scholar was an unpardonable absurdity , in referring to the judges on Mars ' Hill as ' Areopagi . '

		In an age when Latin was the common medium for learned works , and was not uncommon even as a spoken language , this error could not fail to evoke the enemy 's derision .

		Very soon
Hall	PERSON	was out with a rejoin - der , in which he failed not to pounce upon the unlucky ' Areopagi . ' '

		Who were these ? '

		he asks . '

		Truly , my masters , I had thought this had been the name of the place , not the men . '

		Then the Smectymnuans , squirming uneasily under this , and their scholarship smarting with wounded pride , appeared with a ' Vindication of the Answer to the Humble Remonstrance , ' in which they feebly attempted to make light of their blunder .

		Does the Bishop really imagine , they ask , that they were so ignorant as not to know that the more correct word would have been ' Areopagitae , ' though * Areopagi ' might very well be used for shortness ?

		And is the Humble Remonstrant himself so free from verbal slips that he can afford to make merr -RCB- ' over so small a matter ?

		What a specimen of slipshod English is this , for example , in his own late performance , -- ' These other verbal exceptions are but light froth and will sink alone ' !

		The scornful Remonstrant 's ' light froth sinking alone ' is as delicious a blunder any day as their own unoffending ' Areopiagi . '

		The Humble Remonstrant is further importuned by one of his readers , ' a gentleman student in
Philosophy	LOCATION	, ' to publish his receipt for making light froth sink alone , ' that it may be added to the Secrets of
Alexis	PERSON	or the rare experiments of
Baptista Porta	ORGANIZATION	. '

		So much for the amenities of pamphlet con - troversy over verbal slips among scholars to whom conviction of a false quantity , or other reflection on their latinity , was a rankling wound and a festering sore .

		Another literary dispute of the same period illustrates amusingly the awful certainty that a man 's sin will find him out .

		In the very act of trying to deny the authorship of the written word , he often blun - ders into an unconscious confession of guilt .

		Much printer 's ink was shed , soon after the beheading of
Charles I.	PERSON	, in a dispute as to the authorship of the ' Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Ccelum ' an anti-regicide work that made no little stir at the time of its appearance .

		One Alexander More -LRB- or
Morus	PERSON	, as he was ordinarily styled -RRB- had been charged with the authorship , and had been rebuked for his unfeeling refer - ence , in the ' Dedicatory Epistle , ' to
Milton	LOCATION	's blindness .

		In this epistle the Latin Secretary had been taunted Avith his affliction as a just punishment for siding with the regicides , and the familiar Virgilian line had been applied to him , -- '' Monstrum horrendum , informe , ingens , cui lumen ademptum . ''

		Vehemently did Moras protest , in his ' Fides Publica , ' that he hfid had nothing to do with the '
Regii Sanguinis Clamor	PERSON	, ' and that therefore he could not have been guilt -RCB- ' of the heartless allusion referred to .

		Then he added , with most delightful self - betrayal , * If anything occurred to me that might seem to look that way , I referred to the mind . '

		We now know that the book thus unwelcomely fathered on
Morus	PERSON	was , with the exception of the ` Dedicatory Epistle , ' the work of tJie Rev.
Peter du Moulin	PERSON	, who was suitably rewarded therefor by
Charles II	PERSON	.

		But the dedication and the editorship of the whole book remain charged to the account of Moras , who stands convicted out of his own ink-bottle .

		Time turns not back , neither do the presses of the printer .

		Many an author has repented of his earlier volumes jmd sought in vain to suppress them .


Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	made the unwise and fortunately unsuccessful attempt to recall and suppress his little book of plays from the Spanish of
Calderon	LOCATION	, because some stickler for literal accuracy , reviewing the volume in a prominent journal , had found fault with its frankly avowed freedom of rendering .

		But the real poetry in the performance triumphed over the finical objections of the pedantic and undis - cerning critic , and the plays have taken their deserved place in English literature .

		Bitterly did the creator of
Harold Skimpole	PERSON	regret hav - ing thus held Leigh Hunt up to ridicule ; but no expressions of remorse , no penance of self - castigation , would un-write the written word , Happy he who looks not back on indiscretions of this nature , or worse , only to feel the remorse - lessness of the types .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 81 As a man 's speech bewrayeth him , so the written utterance , even if it be but a word , or in some instances hardly more than a letter , is significant of thought and character .

		In a recent excellent work on ' Culture and Restraint , ' which balances the conflicting claims of Hellenism and Hebraism , one little word , a mere auxiliary to the verb , betnays better than pages of argument the author 's bias in this dis - cussion .

		With an unconscious but highly sig - nificant disregard of perfection of form , he writes : ' If we could lay bare all the mental processes , by which we come to a decision or express a preference , we would be surprised how little reason enters into it . '

		Obviously , neither in this nor in any other case is surprise a volun - tary movement of the mind , and what the author meant is that we should be surprised ; but his sense of tlie niceties of accurate expres - sion , -- a sense perhaps associated in his mind with that excessive Hellenism he deprecates , -- is a little dull .

		Hence his involuntary betrayal of his ' preference . '

		Again , referring to the novel descriptive of slum life , but based on theory rather than on experience , he says : ' We will get more true knowledge of the problem from the humble city missionary or the sister of mercy . '

		Here too it is plain that he has in mind no prospective exertion of will power , but a mere necessary result of antecedent conditions .

		This is of course a small matter , microscop - ically small if you choose , but it illustrates how one unconsciously illuminative word or phrase may stamp an author for us better than whole pages of description .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	wantons so systematically and outrageously in the misuse of ' will ' and '
Avould	PERSON	' that the temptation to draw an illustration from his book was irresist - ible .

		Misery loves compiany .

		Those that have blun - dered -LRB- and who has not ? -RRB-

		derive a certain solace from the contemplation of others ' blun - ders that must have caused their perpetrators many an uncomfortable quarter of an hour .

		In his edition of
Shakespeare Pope	ORGANIZATION	has a note to * Measure for Measure , ' to the effect that its plot was taken from
Cinthio	ORGANIZATION	's Novels ,
Dec. 8	DATE	,
Nov. 5	DATE	; that is Decade 8 , Novel 5 .

		The critical
Warburton	PERSON	in his edition fills out the abbrevia - tions thus , --
December 8 , November 5	DATE	.

		St.
Ursula	PERSON	's attendant train of eleven thouvsnnd vir - gins was , it is now thought , all created out of a misinterpretation of a written word .

		In some ancient manuscript was found mention of '
St. Ursula	LOCATION	et
Undecimilla V. M.	PERSON	, ' which being interpreted is nothing more than ' St.
Ursula	PERSON	and
Undecimilla	LOCATION	, virgin martyrs . '

		But the accepted version came to be '
St. Ursula	LOCATION	and eleven thousand virgin martyrs , ' the decipherer mistaking Undecimilla for undecem millia .

		In the first edition of
John Britton	PERSON	's ' Descriptive Sketches of
Tunbridge Wells	PERSON	' is found the fol - lowing amazing reference to Bloody Jeffreys : ' Judge
Jefferies	PERSON	, a man who has rendered his name infamous in the annals of history by the cruelty and injustice he manifested in presiding at the trial of King
Charles I.	PERSON	' Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, ill his ' Gleanings of Past Years , ' relied with a too careless confidence on his knowledge of the
Bible	LOCATION	when he wrote : ' The fierce light that beats upon a throne is sometimes like the heat of that furnace in which only
Daniel	PERSON	could walk unscathed , too fierce for those whose place it is to stand in its vicinity . '

		One may trust that ere this the author has made his peace with Shadrach , Mesh ` ach , and Abednego , for the slight thus unconsciously put upon them .

		Truly , these items are pleasant reading to him that is wont to take comfort in Homer 's occa - sional nodding .

		The subject of misprints would furnish an amusing chapter illustrative of our text .

		The first list of eiTata in a printed book is slaid to be found in an edition of Juvenal , with notes by
Merula	ORGANIZATION	, printed by
Gabriel Pierre	PERSON	at
Venice	LOCATION	in
1478	DATE	.

		Before that date errors had been cor - rected with the pen .

		The longest list of errata on record appears to be that appended to the works of Picus of
Mirandula	LOCATION	, printed by Knob - lauch at
Strasburg	LOCATION	in
1507	DATE	.

		It fills fifteen folio pages .

		Some of the apologies offered by printers for their blunders are quaint and even pathetic .

		They date back , needless to say , before tiiese artisans had become hardened in their sins . '

		A
Study of Adolescence	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In two substantial , almost monumental vol - umes , with the general title of ' Adolescence / President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	has brought together the fruits of the activity of liis vigorous group of disciples at
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	, in a form which will deservedly take rank as the authoritative treatment of a great theme .

		The exhaustive body of material which it represents would in itself be enough to win a secure place for the book .

		But President
Hall	PERSON	also has had peculiar success in welding this somewhat discouraging mass of facts into a whole , which leaves on the mind a remarkably distinct impression .

		The picture of adolescence , -- the * yeasty stage of intense emotions and narrow mentality ' , when the flood-gates of heredity are opened , and new interests and passions jostle one another in a wild disorder , a stage with all the attractiveness and all the vagaries of incipient genius , which is , indeed , but the ' apotheosis of adolescence ' , an adolescence intensified and prolonged , -- stands out in a vivid way .

		All the characteris - tic features of youth , -- its egoism and variable - ness of mood , its fondness for assuming roles and poses , its hero-worship , its intense desire to feel and to be very much alive , its proclivity to superlatives , to high and lurid color , its silli - nesses and enthusiasms and heroisms , -- are treated in a way which is at times highly enter - taining , and which makes many a familiar fact stand out in a new and significant light .

		And back of all there stands the one essential fact of Sex , and of Love .

		From one point of view , the book as a whole might almost be described as a commentary on the Symposium of Plato .

		It is love which constitutes the central and signifi - cant fact of this , the most significant of all the periods of life .

		Out of it
spring	DATE	, by a process of ' long circuiting ' , all the main aspects of the life of spirit , -- art , religion , the social self ; and in his treatment of this theme the author grows occasionally almost dithyrambic .

		Even knowledge at its best is but another form of Eros .

		The thesis may or may not be regarded as proved .

		The relation of the higher aspects of love to the physical fact of sex is indeed left somewhat obscure ; and not every reader will be reconciled , even by the author 's eloquence , to the conception of goodness , truth , and beauty • Adolescence : Its Psychology and its Relations to Physiology , Anthropology , Sociology , Sex , Crime , Religion , and Education .

		as a ' transcendental phallacism . '

		But at any rate the treatment lends to the work in parts ^ especially in the second volume , a larger inter - est than usually belongs to sc-ientific or peda - gogical writings , -- an interest which the arid statistics of the earlier chapters might perhaps lead the general reader to miss , by discouraging him too easily .

		As a whole , the book has a real measure of literary effectiveness ; and in view of this one may regret , in passing , the tendency to a rather barbarous special terminology , which at times spoils the author 's ordinarily lucid and vigorous style .

		From the reviewer 's stlandpoint , the book is discouraging by reason of the wealth of its sub - ject-matter .

		To take it in the large , the earlier chapters deal with the various physical char - acteristics of adolescence , culminating in tihe facts of sexual development .

		Following these there is an interesting , though rather miscel - laneous , chapter on ' Adolescence m Literature and Biography , ' in which Plato and the
Catho	PERSON	- lic Saints ,
Savonarola	PERSON	and
Edison	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Mary MacLane	PERSON	, and a host of others , are some - what promiscuously intermingled .

		After an - other introductory chapter on ' Feelings and
Psychic Development	ORGANIZATION	, ' in which is contained an outline of the author 's general philosophic faith .

		Adolescent Love is discussed , and this is followed by chapters on the various other aspects of the psychical life , -- nature-feeling , religion , social instincts , and intellectual devel - opment .

		Of the multiplicity of special discussions , the most interesting are those in which President
Hall	PERSON	sets forth the educational implications of his facts .

		In these his own main interest is centered .

		Regarding education as man 's chief nroblem , and youth as the golden age of life and its chief danger-point on the proper under - standing and training of which depends all the possibilities of the race , he brings to the theme an enthusiasm ; which is infectious .

		President
Hall	PERSON	's educational views are well known ; but they are expressed here so incisively , and receive such an added weight from the solid back - ground of fact in which they are set , that they have something of a new value .

		One need not agree with all the doctrines expressed to recog - nize their importance as a contribution to edxi - cational theory , -- an importance due primarily to this close connection with the facts of Iwy and girl nature .

		Not much can be done here beyond a mere reference to some of the points which are of more general interest .

		It would be difficult to find a more satisfactory discussion in brief of
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		83 the physical side of education than that in the chapter on ' Motor Function . '

		The vast impor - tance of the subject , especially in view of the great changes in the motor habits of modern man , is not overemphasized ; but the treatment shows a sanity , and a realization of the com - plexity of the problem , which is not always found .

		The criticism of the shortcomings of our present rather one-sided ideals of physical education is clear hnd pertinent , -- the inade - quate provision for industrial training on its liberal side ; the woodenness and narrowness of manual-training courses , in which in particular the fatal mistake has been made of ' cutting industry loose from its product , as if it were a contamination ' ; the failure to bring suf - ficiently to bear idealistic and enthusiastic motives such as are found in the ' gospellers of work , ' headed by
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	; the divorcing of gymnastics from a broad genetic point of view ; and the various dangers of ath - letics .

		Equally judicious is the treatment , on the practical side , of the difficult subject of sexual development and its perversions .

		The chapter on Juvenile Delinquency is more scattering , but contains a good deal of valuable matter .

		The statement that adolescence is the best key to the nature of crime represents the standpoint of the chapter .

		The naturalness , from the point of view of adolescence , of both the less serious and the more serious phenomena of juvenile perversion , and the impossibility of treating these adequately when they are looked at in an isolated way apart from their basis in real demands of the boy 's life , are brought out in a convincing manner .

		The discussion of nature-feeling , again , gives opportunity for a criticism of the modem pedagogy - of science in the schools , and a plea for less thoroughness and precision , more emotional responses of a funda ^ mental sort , and a greater recognition of utili - tarian values .

		Another interesting chapter is the one on the ' Adolescent Psychology of Con - version . '

		President
Hall	PERSON	was the pioneer in the field of study of conversion in connection with adolescence , and he has something fresh to say even in view of the rapidly increasing litera - ture of the subject , from Starbuck to Professor
James	PERSON	-LRB- whose recent book is characterized as the yellow literature of religious psychology -RRB- .

		Another good discussion of practical value is that which deals with adolescent societies .

		The strictures upon some of the tendencies found in the
Y. P. S. C. E.	PERSON	, and similar organizations , deserve to be read by all religious leaders .

		Less easy to sum up , but equally worthy of consideration , is the treatment of education and intellectual development .

		In general , our prev - alent methods are held to show scant knowledge of adolescent psychology , and to neglect nearly all the suggestions offered by the natural demands of youth .

		Instead of the strenuous and highly intellectual ized programme of the present-day secondary school , with its examina - tions and rigid requirements , its insistence upon form ratlier than content , and upon elements instead of large living wholes , ' youth needs repose , leisure , art , legends , romance , idealiza - tion , in a word humanism . '

		* The educational ideal is to develop capacity in as many direc - tions as possible , to indulge caprice and velleity a little , to delay consistency for a time , and let the diverse prepotencies struggle with each other . '

		President
Hall	PERSON	has a standing quarrel with educational committees and most of their working principles , and with the whole attempt to regulate the high-school on the part of the college .

		His conception of the education of women brings him into still sharper opposition to prevailing tendencies .

		It emphasizes the differences of sex as essential , and , in place of foisting upon women ' the old college training which has proved unfit for men , ' calls for an elaborate reconstruction of women 's education , which shall both recognize the claims of her physical limitations first of all , and shall frankly look toward maternity as the normal end of her being .

		On account of the difference of her needs and interests , combined with other rea - sons , coeducation in the high-school period is deprecated ; and a strong protest is entered against the progressive feminization of second - ary education .

		The characterization of the dif - ferences between the two sexes is interesting , and the whole argument is one to be taken into serious account , though it is hardly likely that it has given the final word on the subject .

		Especially timely is the closing chapter on ' Adolescent Races and their Treatment . '

		This is a real contribution to the insistent problem of imperialism ; the carrying over of the con - cept of adolescence to immature and uncivilized races proves really enlightening .

		The chapter shows effectively how false , psychologically , has been our whole policy of attempting to make over off-hand races with alien methods of thought and feeling into our own likeness , instead of patiently studying them and helping them develop the possibilities of their own genius ; while the puncturing of the naive assumption that all of good is contained in our own civilization , and the justification of poten - cies in less developed races which would , if allowed to mature , add elements of real value to our own life , is a good piece of argument .

		Alike , then , for its exhaustive collection of 84 THE DIAL -LSB- Aagust 16 , facts about adolescence , and for its deductions from these in the reahn of practical and educa - tional doctrine , the book is of serious and per - manent value .

		It is , however , ambitious to be considerably more than this ; and about this further claim there may be some difference of opinion .

		For President
Hall	PERSON	puts forth the book as an essay in a new and epoch-making philosophy , opposed to dominant tendencies , for which , as academic , ' epistemological , ' and anti-evolutionary , h.e has nothing but con - demnation .

		The epistemologists , however , will probably not be convinced that he has succeeded , after all , in striking out any very new and exclusive way .

		President
Hall	PERSON	's own interests are concrete and scientific , and for this his book is of course none the worse .

		But it is not uncommon for lovers of concrete fact to decry as useless and academic the less attractive work of a philosophical criticism of categories ; and of this somewhat short-sighted tendency Presi - dent
Hall	PERSON	is not wholly guiltless .

		It might be expected , therefore , that his own attempts at a positive and constructive statement would lay themselves open to criticism for a certain lack of rigor , both in method and result .

		As for method , the chief plea would seem to be for the precedence of carefully collected fact over theory ; i. e. , when interpreted , for the relative unimportance of an introspective study of the adult ' consciousness , and of philosophies based upon this , as compared with the wider observa - tional method , exemplified , e. g. , in the ques - tionnaire , and applied to children , savages and animals .

		Abstractly , of course , the first point is undeniable ; but one can not help thinking that the author exaggerates both the dearth of valuable fact among the ' introspective ' psy - chologists , and the importance and novelty of the results of his own method .

		Tliere is no need at all to deny that the work of the
Clark	PERSON	school has brought out a great deal that is interesting and valuable , especially in view of the evidence afforded by the present volume .

		That it has shown some leaning to the elaboration of com - monplaces , and to the mistaken notion that fig - uring averages constitutes scientific method , can not altogether be overlooked .

		Still , even such a statement , for example , as that so many youths and maidens out of a hundred ' confess that the sight of the moon makes them want to see their beau or girl , ' easy as it might be to hold it up to ridicule , may be given a signifi - cance , as President
Hall	PERSON	has shown .

		But with - out at all questioning the value of the work , it may nevertheless be doubted whether it really has the relative importance claimed for it , and whether , in particular , it is sufficient to serve as the basis of a new philosophy .

		It is hardly pos - sible in a few lines to sift out the various motives which enter into the view of the world to which , in President
Hall	PERSON	's opinion , his facts are to lead .

		In part they are undoubtedly true .

		But here he does somewhat less than justice to his opponents , who often would have no quarrel with him .

		For the rest , it is perhaps enough to mention what seem to be the most distinctive points of his doctrine .

		First , there is the in - sistence that the psychical life is to be inter - preted as a recapitulation of and a witness to a multiplicity of paSt racial experiences , and is to be known by tracing out all the obscure roots and branches of the buried tree of its pedigree .

		This of course , again , would be generally recog - nized as true within certain limits ; and
Presi	PERSON	- dent
Hall	PERSON	has applied it in detail in a way that is always interesting , and at times carries con - viction .

		That our love of natural objects is a trace of primitive idolatries ; that the blush at compliments is the vasomotor survival of a state when to be admired meant danger ; that the approximate adjustment of the child to his environment , from nine to twelve , represents an old and relatively perfected state of race matur - ity , possible in warm climates ; that the delight in bonfires is a reverberation of the joy that in some prehistoric time hailed the Prometheus art of controlling fire and defyin ?

		night ; that truancy is the gift of an early nomadic culture , -- these and numerous other suggestions are scattered through his pages , some of them more , some of them decidedly less , convincing .

		One of the most elaborate is the detailed discussion in the chapter on nature-feeling , in which the instinctive fear of thunder and lightning , of serpents , of high winds , of falling , and of water , tlie habit of inducing sleep by rocking , agoro - phobia , and the climbing instinct , are cited as relics of a primitive arboreal life .

		But to recog - nize the legitimacy of such an explanation does not bind one to accept the conclusions that are drawn from it , ^ to look upon it as the deepest and exclusive truth of the life of spirit , and to minimize the significance of the developed con - sciousness ; and in doing this the author lays himself open to serious objections , alike from the theoretical standpoint and from that of a practical philosophy of life , of which he shows no appreciation .

		Still more vague , and in need of a critical clearing up , is the final outlook upon the world of spirit to which all this leads , -- the conception of a collective soul , which is itself visible nature , a ' sensorium of wondrous subtlety that reflects in its multipersonal facets most that has been in the world . '

		The conscious adult is a ' maimed fragment broken off and detached from the great world of soul ' ; ^ his fuller consciousness is a ' late , partial , and per - haps essentially abnormal and remedial outcrop of the great underlying life of man-soul , ' a ' wart raised by the sting of sin . ' '

		Is not this an instance of just the fanciful , barren use of

A. K. Rogers	PERSON	.

		A
Documentary History of Columbus	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
John Boyd Thacher	PERSON	has given us a new study of
Columbus	LOCATION	in three large volumes .

		The work is an examination of the problems pre - sented by the life of the discoverer , rather than a formal biography .

		The first and second volumes cover the period of his life , and present in order biographical essays on
Peter Martyr	PERSON	and
Las Casas	LOCATION	as the first historians of
America	LOCATION	, an introductory discussion of the character and aims of
Columbus	LOCATION	, the story of his early life and the formation of his purpose , a study of Toscanelli and an examination of the pilot story , the details of the first voyage , the an - nouncement of the discovery , the papal bulls and line of demarcation , and an account of the later voyages .

		The third volume is devoted to supplementary matters : a classification of the alleged portraits , a study of the handwriting of Colnmbus , an elaborate investigation in twenty chapters of the location of his remains , and a brief account of his descendants .

		The most conspicuous and at the same time the most useful feature of the work is the reproduction and ciareful English translation of the more important sources of information .

		The purpose set forth in the preface is to pre - sent to the reader all the information about
Columbus	LOCATION	available in the sixteenth century , and to add such as has since come to light .

		A considerable part of this material is given in facsimile .

		The facsimiles include the relevant passages in
Peter Martyr	PERSON	's Epistles ; the unique examples of both the folio and quarto editions of the letter to
Santangel	LOCATION	; the papal bulls , as copied in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	Register ; the Coma - Syllacius letter ; the unique examples of the famous Libretto and of the equally famous Lettera , and all known documents in the hand - writing of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		Besides the facsimiles , there are reprints of the lives of
Gallo	PERSON	and Senarega ,
Giustiniano	ORGANIZATION	's note in the Polyglot Psalter , the Journal of the first voyage , the
Chanca	LOCATION	narrative of the second voyage , the let - ter to the Nurse and I ^ as
Casas	ORGANIZATION	's narrative of the third voyage , and the
Porras	PERSON	and
Mendez	PERSON	narratives of the fourth voyage .

		A great deal of bibliographical material is given with a view * Christophek Columbus : His Life , his Work , his Remains .

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		of making the work useful to the collector of rare Americana .

		It would have been an excel - lent arrangement if the source material had been put together in a separate volume sep - arately obtainable .

		The reader approaches Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's own text with some misgiving .

		This feeling is trace - able to two causes .

		In the first place , Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	very clearly undertakes the work for the purpose of rehabilitating the memory of
Columbus	LOCATION	and defending him from the harsh strictures of recent critics .

		In the introductory chapter he lays down the thesis that
Colum	PERSON	- bus was one of the greatest characters in the world 's history , and then devotes the remainder of the work to its proof .

		This gives the book the air of a special plea rather than that of an investigation for the discovery of truth .

		There seem to be two veins running through the whole .

		One is written in the spirit of historical research , and the other is extrava - gant panegyric unwarranted by the facts pre - sented .

		The frontispiece of the first volume is a fine etching , based upon the
Marine	ORGANIZATION	portrait , which Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	labels ' an imaginative but satisfactory portrait of
Columbus	LOCATION	. '

		It is diffi - cult to escape the feeling that Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	is endeavoring to draw ' an imaginative but satis - factory ' pen-picture , and thJat his Judgment at critical points is likely to be warped by his partiality for his subject .

		The second ground for distrust of Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's work arises from his failure to indi - cate the source of much of his material and to give credit to the work of other scholars .

		Although he dedicates his volumes to Mr.
Har	PERSON	- risse , and refers to him frequently in his pages , the extent of his indebtedness is hardly appar - ent .

		There is an interesting chapter on
Ferdi	PERSON	- nand
Columbus	LOCATION	and his library , but Mr.
Har	PERSON	- ri & se 's '
Excerpta Colombiniana	ORGANIZATION	' is not credited as its source of inspiration .

		All of tlie documents printed by Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	, with the possible excep - tion of a few of the
Columbus	LOCATION	manuscripts , have appeared in Navarrete or the
Raccolta Colom	LOCATION	- biana , but the fact could not be gathered from his pages .

		The source of the
Porras	PERSON	and
Mendez	PERSON	narratives , taken from
Navarrete	LOCATION	, is not indi - cated , and an account of the
Raccolta	LOCATION	is rele - gated to the index .

		Of the Libretto he strangely says that ' probably its pages have never been closely examined until they looked into the camera to be reproduced for this work , ' but , although not photographed , the Libretto was transcribed and must have been closely exam - ined for the
Raccolta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pennesi is not cited in the chapters on
Peter Martyr	PERSON	, and
Uzielli	PERSON	only incidentally in those on
Toscanelli	LOCATION	.

		Cronau 's name appears but once in the discussion about the remains of
Columbus	LOCATION	, and the source of Mr. 86 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Thacher	PERSON	's information upon the subject is not indicated .

		The only English translation for which credit is given is the translation of the Coma-Syllflcius letter printed by Mr.
Lennox	PERSON	.

		Kettel 's is said to be the only English rendering of the Journal , though it seems that
Markham	PERSON	's would have been consulted .

		With an air of novelty , Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	points to the reference to the
Great Khan	PERSON	, in the prologue to the Journal and in the ' Lettera , ' as a reference by
Colum	PERSON	- bus to
Toscanelli	ORGANIZATION	's letter , although this was a part of Humboldt 's original argument , and Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	has already shown that
Columbus	LOCATION	might have derived his information from
Marco Polo	PERSON	, and that the reference tells quite as strongly in favor of the fabrication of the letter as it does in favor of its genuineness .

		Under these circumstances , the reader is unable to dis - tinguish between Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's own conclusions and those he has adopted from others .

		The
Columbus	LOCATION	material is so extensive and so intri - cate that the writer who attempts to deal with it should make the frankest possible statement of his sources and of his mental processes .

		Candor inspires confidence .

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's omissions in this direction impair confidence .

		The arrangement of this complicated material is a difficult problem , which Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	has not solved with complete success .

		The Tos - canelli discussion is divided between the first and the third volumes , and scattered through the notes in all three .

		Much important matter given in notes should have been embodied in the text , -- as , for example , the hypothesis to explain the inaccuracies of the Latin copy of the Toscanelli letter .

		Doubtless the scattering of the Toscanelli matter results from the addi - tion of much of it since the appearance of Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	's book .

		Other material is , however , scattered in the same way .

		With a section devoted to
Las Casas	LOCATION	, one naturally looks to it for an account of the manuscripts of the ' His - toria , ' but it is not given until the authorities for the third voyage are discussed .

		The chap - ter on
Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	's library breaks into the middle of the examination of
Columbus	LOCATION	's hand - writing .

		The chapter on the voyage to
Iceland	LOCATION	closes with the quotation from
Ferdinand	LOCATION	, with which it should have begun .

		The clearness and force of the entire work would have been greatly increased by a better arrangement of the subject matter .

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's conclusions upon controverted questions of fact may be briefly summarized .

		He regards the ' Historic ' as substantially the work of Ferdinand ; he places the birth-date of
Columbus	LOCATION	at
1446	DATE	, upon the basis of
Columbus	LOCATION	's own statements as to the length of various periods in his life ; he accepts the doubtful story of the voyage to
Iceland	LOCATION	, and incidentally the still more doubtful one of the Zeni ; he con - nects the wife of
Columbus	LOCATION	remotely with the family of Perestrello , and apparently accepts the supposed residence at
Porto Santo	LOCATION	; he places the landfall at Watling 's island , credit * the alleged first voyage of Yespucius , regards the remains at
San Domingo	LOCATION	as undoubtedly the true remains of the discoverer , and con - cludes that there is no authentic portrait of
Columbus	LOCATION	in existence .

		From the fact that this is the first life of
Columbus	LOCATION	to appear since the publication of Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	's book , interest naturally attaches to the treatment of the Toscanelli letter .

		As set forth by Mr.
Vignaud	PERSON	, the discussion turns upon two distinct points , -- first , the pilot story , set up as a motive for fabricating the letter ; and , second , the claim that the letter is not gen - uine .

		With regard to the first point , Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	shows very efi'ectively that the pilot story is both improbable and unsupported by contemporary evidence .

		He makes the plausible suggestion that the story originated in the state - ment of
Columbus	LOCATION	's Journal that the report of land to the westward was current in the Canaries and
Azores	LOCATION	, and that a man from the
Madeira Islands	LOCATION	besought the
King of Portugal	ORGANIZATION	in
1584	DATE	for a caravel in order to go to it .

		It is just such a story as
Columbus	LOCATION	's enemies would have invented in order to undermine and discredit him .

		If anything could have been made out of it , it would have been used in the inquiry brought in
1513	DATE	against
Ferdinand Columbus	ORGANIZATION	to test his rights and privileges .

		With the rejection of the pilot story , there is no adequate motive for the fabrication of the letter .

		With regard to the letter itself , it is too early in the controversy to attempt to pronounce judgment .

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	contends that the Latin copy is in the handwriting of
Columbus	LOCATION	, and his study of the characteristics of
Columbus	LOCATION	's hand - writing is so careful and painstaking that his opinion upon this point carries great weight .

		If this be true , then the letter , if not genuine , was forged by
Columbus	LOCATION	himself .

		There is one explanation of
Columbus	LOCATION	's silence with respect to the letter , which seems not to have been noticed .

		By basing his applications for assist - ance upon the letter , he would have deprived himself of the credit of initiating the plan of reaching the Indies by a westward route , and would have diminished the rewards he could demand for its successful achievement .

		To base his plan upon the opinions of ancient geogra - phers and the reports of medianlal travellers was very different in effect from an appeal to the authority of a man who was living when the efforts to secure assistance were begun , and who had been dead but ten years when the discovery was finally accomplished .

		The distinguished
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 scientist would immediately have been hailed as the real discoverer of
America	LOCATION	, and the unknown adventurer would have been regarded as his humble agent .

		This consideration seems suffi - cient to explain one of the principal objections urged against the authenticity of the Tosc-anelli letter .

		As the matter now stands , there still seems insufficient reason for doubting the opin - ion of
Las Casas	LOCATION	that the letter was genuine , or for charging him with complicity in deception .

		In discussing the character of
Columbus	LOCATION	, Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	excuses his unfaithfulness in his family life by the lax morals of the age , and pleads the holy object for which he wished to acquire wealth in extenuation of his avarice .

		He meets the charge of initiating Indian slavery with the claim that
Columbus	LOCATION	intended to confine sla - very to the cannibals who preyed upon the other tribes .

		He shows that the oath that
Cuba	LOCATION	was a continent , imposed upon the masters and sail - ors during the second voyage , was the work of the notary and not required by the instructions of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		He , however , charges
Columbus	LOCATION	with untruthfulness in writing to the sov - ereigns , upon his last voyage , that he had reached the ' province of Mango , which borders upon Cathay , ' since Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	believes that
Columbus	LOCATION	at this time realized that he had found a new world , and wrote this statement in order to deceive the pilots who might try to profit by his discoveries .

		Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	has shown that the opinion prevailed as early as
1501	DATE	that a new continent had been discovered .

		Columbus 's life and success were so completely bound up in reaching
Asia	LOCATION	that it was natural for him to cling to his first impression that he had done so .

		It therefore seems more reasona - ble to regard as sincere his statement that he had reached Mango and the borders of Cathay .

		It was distinctly more creditable to him to cling honestly to error than to misrepresent his real opinion .

		While there is some fault to be found with Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's method , and necessarily some difference of opinion with respect to his conclu - sions , his work is nevertheless an immense store - house of material and a distinct addition to the literature of American history .

		The index , while apparently full , is far from serving as a guide to all the matter contained in the text and notes .

		The volumes are beautifully printed , beautifully illustrated , and remarkably free from typographical errors .

		There is a con - spicuous lack of maps ; the only one illustrating the voyages is a photographic reproduction of a German canal map upon which the names are wholly illegible .

		The work affords occasional glimpses of the author 's splendid collection of Americana .

		In the second volume he says that his efforts to secure the privilege of examining , in the interest of historical inquiry , the original manuscript of the Libretto have been unsuccess - ful ; but a note in the index conveys the satisfy - ing information that it is now in his possession .

		An account of the acquisition of his treasures would make an interesting story .


F. H. HODDER	PERSON	, Books about
Dante	PERSON	.

		* The third series of Dr.
Edward Moore	PERSON	's ' Studies in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	' gives us a group , of five essays , only two of which have been previously published , even in part .

		The first of these essays , on ' The Astronomy of
Dante	LOCATION	, ' is designed for students ' who may not wish to embark on the subject of the study of Astronomy generally , ' yet who wish to understand the many passages in Dante which set forth his notions of cosmog - ony , of the zodiac and planetary motions , and of the measurement of time .

		Dr.
Moore	PERSON	in this essay makes it clear that the astronomical allu - sions are easily intelligible , and do not require the aid of the
Nautical Almanac	ORGANIZATION	as an adjunct to their study .

		The essay on ' The Geography of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	' discusses the sources of his knowl - edge , and shows that he did not possess the exceptional acquaintance with the geographical science of his time that he did with the
Ptole	PERSON	- maic system of astronomy .

		88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, equipped at every point , and entirely worthy of the author 's great reputation among students of the diAdne poet .

		The work of Mr ,
Dods	PERSON	entitled ' Forerunners of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	' has practically nothing to say about
Dante	PERSON	himself , yet students of the * Divine Comedy ' will find their account in this interest - ing study of the unseen world as it was imag - ined by the seers and the legend-makers of ancient and mediaeval times .

		The object of the author 's essay is ' to make some attempt at constructing , from visions only , the idea of Heaven ,
Purgatory	ORGANIZATION	, and Hell , which wias cur - rent at the beginning of the fourteenth cen - tury ; not , be it distinctly understood , the idea which was actually present to the mind of the Florentine . '

		It is a research ` not conducted from
Dante	LOCATION	backwards , but from the infancy of the idea forward to the master interpreter as a convenient stopping-place and climax . '

		In selecting from the large amount of material offered , the author has placed his work on an ethical rather than a purely imaginative basis .

		Beginning with Babylonian and Egyptian myths of the dead , he goes on to consider Greek and Eoman examples -LRB-
Odysseus	ORGANIZATION	, Ji ^ neas , Er , and Somnium Scipionis -RRB- , and comes finally to early Christian legends , as found in the New Testament , the apocryphal books , and the ingenious imaginings of media3val times .

		All of these matters are summarized and discussed by Mr.
Dods	PERSON	in as pleasing a manner as the subject permits , the treatment being addressed to a popular audience rather than to an assem - blage of scholars . '

		The Dread Inferno , ' by
Miss M. Alice Wyld	PERSON	, is an unpretentious little book of ` notes for beginners , ' based upon several years of elemen - tary work with reading-classes .

		It takes us through the ' Inferno , ' and supplies abundant references to the text as we go , besides a simple running commentary .

		The writer emphasizes the importance of Mr.
P. H. Wicksteed	PERSON	's advice to ' read
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's own words first and last , and the words of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's teachers , rather than those of his commentators . '

		The spirit of the book is reverent , and its essential teaching is found in the statement that '
Dante	PERSON	puts no one in Hell , but sorrowfully shows us how men -- some of them beloved and honoured friends or heroes -- put themselves there . '

		A work of somewhat similar scope , perhaps a trifle more scholarly in treatment , is Mr.
Adolphus T. Ennis	PERSON	's ' Introduction to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's Inferno . '

		The author says that his object ' will have been accomplished if , by giving to the sym - bolism of words , and allegory of facts , that interpretation which canons based on intrinsic and extrinsic evidence can only sanction , it will contribute in the least degree to quicken the analvtical and comparative faculties of the stu - dent of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, so as to enable him to arrive at the true synthesis of the Divine Comedy . '

		This sentence fairly exemplifies the authors style , which is so ponderous as to make his book some - what dilficult to read .

		He writes from the standpoint of a Catholic , and speaks of
Italy	LOCATION	as his native country .

		The last book upon our list is a study by Pro- fessor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	, of '
Dante	PERSON	and the English Poets from Chaucer to
Tennyson	LOCATION	. '

		It is a highly scholarly work , based upon a study of the standard commentators on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, as well as upon a thorough examination of English poetry for traces of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's influence .

		The author is not one of those who accept slight parallelisms as proof positive that one poet has inspired another , and is on his guard against being deceived by chance resemblances .

		This danger is particularly great in the case of the earlier English poets , who , together with
Dante	PERSON	, to a certain extent drew their material from a common stock .

		The author says : ' To say noth - ing of natural coincidences , the whole period of the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	is full of a widely diffused materia poetica , if I may be allowed the expres - sion , consisting of constantly repeated thoughts and discussions , commonplaces of theology , philosophy , and social theories ... The same thing is true of certain metaphors and figures . '

		Professor
Kuhns	PERSON	is possibly a trifle too cautious and skeptical in his fear of being deceived , but his example is a wholesome one in an age that finds a number of otherwise intel - ligent persons taking seriously the notion that the works of
Bacon	LOCATION	and of Shakespeare were written by the same person .

		More than half of this volume is devoted to the English poets of the nineteenth century , and even then only six of them are closely examined .

		We are very glad to have this little book , which belongs to an imperfectly-cultivated but extremely impor - tant branch of the historical criticism of litera - ture .

		We wish , with Professor
Kuhns	PERSON	, that some one having the necessary equipment might undertake to trace the influence upon English literature of all the great foreign writers , -- ` not merely from a philological or scientific point of view , but with a sympathetic feeling for the esthetic and psychological processes involved in the making of literature .

		Problems of t he P resent South .

		* In order to appreciate the spirit and motive of Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	's book entitled ` The Present South , ' one should consider two facts in con - n ection with the life and vocation of its author .

		*
Thk Present South	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
E. Gardner Murphy	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1904 -RSB- , THE DIAL 89 We are told that it ' was written from within the life and thought of the South , by one who , through birth , education , and training , has shared its traditions and experience / The other fact which it is worth while to know is that the author gave up his work as an Episcopal clergyman in order to become the executive agent of the
Conference for Southern Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , whose chief mission is to bring about har - mony and helpful cooperation among the vari - ous elements concerned in the solution of the South 's problems .

		Education is the chief re - liance of this Conference , as it is the chief factor which its agent exploits in the present volume .

		Mr ,
Murphy	ORGANIZATION	represents the connecting link between the best traditions of the old South and the more liberal and common-sense disposi - tion of the new .

		He does not stand alone , but typifies a class .

		The substance and spirit of this volume might easily have been produced by any one of a dozen men of the new South .

		Had the work appeared anonymously , the know - ing ones might , justly enoug ` h , have ascribed the authorship to Chancellor Hill ,
Bishop Gal	ORGANIZATION	- loway , Professor
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	,
Presi	PERSON	- dent
Alderman	PERSON	, Professor
Claxton	PERSON	, Dr.
Dabney	PERSON	, or Mr.
Walter H. Page	PERSON	; albeit , it is doubtful if many of these Southern celebrities could have equalled , or any of them surpassed , Mr.
Mur	PERSON	- phy in power and charm of literary style .

		This progressive and courageous group represents the erstwhile silent South which has so long re - mained tongue-tied under threat of political and social calamity .

		When such voices first began to make themselves heard , they were regarded either as simpletons , incendiaries , or harmless religious enthusiasts .

		Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	was banished , Mr.
Lewis H. Blair	PERSON	was ignored , Mr.
Atticus G. Haygood	PERSON	was made a bishop .

		But of late this voice has become ' something louder than before / and has taken on such volume and power that it can no longer be ignored as an important factor in the South - ern situation .

		The late Dr.
J. L. M. Curry	PERSON	was , during his lifetime , the dean and presiding genius of this new propaganda .

		At the same time there has sprung up in the North a set of men who have broken , if not with the spirit , at least with the erstwhile method , of Northern philanthropy , which lavished its purse and its compassion upon the most needy race , with little quest for compromise or cooperation with the dominant - sentiment within the field of its operation .

		Mr.
Eobert C. Ogden	PERSON	and Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
H. Baldwin Jr.	PERSON	typify the spirit of this new Northern philanthropy .

		The union of these two forces North and South has resulted in the
Conference for Southern Education	ORGANIZATION	and the
General Education Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		These organiza - tions are composed of the same men differently distributed , and are under the leadership of the North , but are practically directed by the South .

		Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	's book is the first full and effective expression of this new philanthropy .

		.

		It is indeed a voice from the South , but not so much the South that was or is as the South which is to be .

		The dominant South , that element which has captured political supremacy and shapes public policies , has based its tri - umph upon the enmity of race .

		Only the skil - ful politician knows , the value of hatred as a political dynamic .

		During the past ten years , no Southern statesman upon either floor of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has uttered one kindly or courageous word in behalf of his black constituents ; but , on the other hand , they have incessantly breathed out hatred and bitterness .

		But Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	stands for the awakening South , and typifies the conscience and culture of that sec - tion which must in the end triumph over organized and unreasoning arrogance .

		It is noticeable that the new spirit is the outgrowth of the educational idea , and illustrates the liberalizing influence of culture .

		Knowledge always gives a wider horizon and a broader vista , so that social evils , however vexed or pressing their present phase , are viewed in both their historic and prophetic perspective .

		It is only by the longest range of vision , reaching both forward and back , that the author sees with clear discernment the truth which he puts in the interrogative form only for emphasis : ' Have prosperity , peace , and happiness , ever been successfully or permanently based upon indolence , inefficiency , and hopelessness ?

		Since time began , has any human thing that God has made taken damage to itself or brought dam - age to the world through knowledge , truth , hope , and honest toil ? '

		Will Senator
Tillman	PERSON	or Governor
Vardaman	PERSON	gainsay this principle ?

		or will they persist in the declarations that uni - versal truth fails of effect only when applied to the black man ?

		The key-note that runs thi * ough the whole treatment is based upon the dual assumption that the Negro in his present state is inferior to the white man , but that his condition is improvable .

		The author does not u.nder - take to set any limit to this improvability , unlike many of our social philosophers who assume full knowledge of the eternal decrees , arid tell us that the black man 's status is unal - terably fixed in the divine scheme of things .

		Professor
Bassett	PERSON	, of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, N , C , in a notable magazine article , ventured to predict that the Negro would gain equality some day , and for this he was made to suffer the penalty of persecution , the common lot of all seers who indulge in unpleasant prophecies , l ^ r. Mur - phy throughout this volume seems careful not to invite persecution or martyrdom .

		And yet his words are candid and courageous : ` Eecog -
90	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, nizing the double fact , -- first the fact of the Negro 's need , and then the fact of the
Negro	ORGANIZATION	's promise , -- the South has coQceived her respon - sibility , both as a policy of supreme self-interest and as an obligation of Christian stewardship . '

		The reader should always bear in mind that when the author speaks of ' the South ' he imputes to the dominant South a full portion of his own liberal spirit , and thus instead of por - traying the situation as it is we are given a foretaste of ' the substance of things hoped for . '

		The author upholds the two fundamental dogmas of the South , -- viz. , white supremacy and the denial of ' social equality ' to the Negro , -- and endeavors to reconcile the black man 's freest and fullest development to the limitation which these assumptions necessarily impose .

		These dogmas stir
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sentiment , ah imo , as
Virgil	PERSON	would say .

		Upon this territory one does well , to tread cautiously , for it is regarded as both dangerous and holy ground .

		It must be said , in all candor , that these topics are treated with much less moral assuredness and carrying conviction than the purely economic and educa - tional question where the author felt free to detach himself from traditional and provincial bias .

		The tight-rope walker whose chief con - cern is to preserve his balance must rely upon acrobatic skill .

		The assertion that ' the South was right and the North was right ' leaves us somewhat bewildered as to the sharp distinc - tions between right and wrong which the moral - ist is wont to insist upon .

		The author , however , is not a doctrinnaire ; he deals in applied rather than pure ethics .

		He does not impotently bewail the exigency of a pressing situation because the ' Ten Commandments will not budge . '

		The practical constructive statesman considers what can be done rather than what ought to be done .

		The author lays down a work - ing hypothesis , a modus vivendi , with little insistence upon moral abstractions .

		Many of the shortcomings of the South are glozed over with the nonchalant complacency of a recent writer who claimed that the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	gentle - man possessed virtues that at once contravened and transcended the ordinary moralities .

		There is not a single note of unkindness or of con - scious injustice to the Negro between the lids of this book .

		The fullest opportunity and out - look are advocated , but it is not always made clear how these can be realized in face of restrictive theories that are upheld .

		We are told that the poor whites whom the slaveholding aristocracy pushed to the outer edge of the political and social circle have fused with their erstwhile betters , so as to form a white democracy of wliich the Nergo forms no part .

		This new democracy is dominated mainly by the nether element which has but lately become conscious of its political power .

		A novus homo , a Pharaoh that knew not
Joseph the Black	PERSON	, is now on the throne .

		The ruling politicians who are now so frantic about white supremacy and so fearful of Negro domination never owned a slave nor anything else under the old regime .

		The old aristocrats who would con - tinue in politics must do so at the sufferance of their new and numerous allies .

		They are forced to sacrifice both their statesmanlike breadth of view and their traditionjal chivalric spirit .

		In the
North	ORGANIZATION	, the democracy has become aristocrat - ized ; in the South , the aristocracy has become democratized .

		In the large cities , however , the Southern conditions find an exact reduplica .

		The Congressional delegation from
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts represents the best traditions of the com - monwealth , but the reverse is the case in most of the old slave-holding States .

		The author asks , with solicitous though , with affirmative implication : ' Is the organization of democracy in our
Southern States	LOCATION	never to include him -LSB- the Negro -RSB- ?

		Is he never to be a factor of government and the heir of a free and generous life ? '

		Modem democracy can not be based upon the Grecian model which rested upon the enslaved masses that formed no part of the body politic .

		This is an impossibility both by reason of our theory of government and the relative numerical strength of the two races .

		The Negro forms scarcely a third of the South 's popula - tion .

		Even under slavery , nine-tenths of the white race were throwTi outside the pale of aristocratic distinction , because the underlying basis of slavery was not broad enough t-o support so heavy a superincumbent weight .

		It is impos - sible to ennoble the entire white race in the South at the expense of the
Negro	LOCATION	.

		All aristo - cratic hierarchies must proceed with diminish - ing numbers according to the ascending scale of rank .

		The pyramid of class ennoblement can never be made to stand on its apex .

		Two chapters are devoted to child-labor in the South .

		This is the only topic in which the Negro is not made an integral and vital element .

		And yet the treatment of this white child - labor , which calls for such drastic meas - ures of reform , is suggestive of the reactionary effect of indifference to the hardship of Negro labor , as instanced in the convict lease and peonage systems .

		Cruelty in any form to the black man will ultimately redound to the detri - ment of the whites .

		In the play of Cymbeline , the queen orders her physician to prepare for her ' most dangerous compounds , ' so that she might ' try their forces on such creatures as we count not worthy of hanging . '

		But the cautious physicia ^ entered a most sagacious protest : ' Your highness shall from this practice make your heart hard . '

		The South should beware lest the cruel and inhuman treatment heaped upon the Negro should harden their hearts
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 91 against like usiage practiced against their own race .

		The claim that the present degree of amalga - mation of the races is due to the presence in the South of the soldiers of both armies immedi - ately after the Civil War , rather than to the established practice of the slave regime , seems to be misleading both as to fact and inference ; and it is hoped that the author will either sub - stantiate or withdraw this statement in the subsequent editions which the demand for a book in the main so hopeful and so helpful is sure to make necessary .

		Meanings of
International	ORGANIZATION	.

		Trade .

		* There have arisen , in this country and abroad , two conflicting views concerning the nature and origin of foreign trade ; and each view has had its authoritative exponents .

		By one class it has been urged that external trade is preceded by the national flag , and may accordingly and fittingly be instituted with impressive military ceremony by the admiral or general in command .

		By another , -- and to this class of convinced free-traders Mr.
Hob	PERSON	- aon , the author of a recent book on ' Interna - tional Tfade , ' is well known to belong , -- it is maintained !

		that trade , whether at home or between nations , is always preceded by the trader , who is always found acting individually and never in a public capacity .

		The ` higgling of the market , ' the infinite voluntary meetings of ' pairs ' of buyers and sellers , -- all this is what has visibly been going on al > out us , every day in the .

		year , in all ages .

		Yet the author has sought to extend the ratio of these free pri - vate exchanges in the home market to all meet - ings of all buyers and sellers in all markets the world over , foreign as well as domestic .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	holds that ' the principles of exchange of commodity are essentially the same , whether the exchange talces place between members of the same nation , and is called internal trade , or between m-embers of different nations and is called international trade . '

		In their vast and rapidly growing domestic trade , American citizens have before their eyes the best basis of comparison of free and unfree systems of exchange .

		Large numbers of these Americans are extensively engaged in both domestic and foreign trade .

		They will there - fore be better able to grasp , and to teach others to grasp , the full meaning of the economic prop - osition that the units of politics and commerce are not the same ; that nations do not trade with each other , except in paper statistics , and • International Trade : An
Application of Economic Theory	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John A. Hobson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:

		there only in a metaphoric sense .

		The false notion that nations are traders , we are told , is suggested by the fact that governments estab - lish ' tariffs ' and other politioo-economic devices for the real or supposed benefit of certain of their citizens grouped in * trades ' or ' interests . '

		Certain world-tendencies are described by the author , and are said to cause a keen interna - tional comparison of the efficiency of home capital and labor with that of foreign coun - tries ; to establish also international division of labor , which is at once the result and the cause of international trade .

		It is said that internal transport , the distributive trades , and profes - sional and other non-material productions , are engaging an ever-growing proportion of the national energy ; while as regards production of material forms of wealth , a larger proportion of workers are occupied in the final processes of adapting goods to the special tastes and habits of local groups of consumers .

		This implies , in a normal condition of industrial development , that a smaller proportion of the real wealth of a nation i. e. , of the aggregate of goods and services , -- is capable of forming the material of international trade .

		It implies , moreover , that an ever-increasing proportion of the ' real wealth ' is going into the material of domestic trade .

		As the book appears at the outset of our Presidential campaign , a discussion so timely and so candid of an important phase of the tariff controversy should be welcomed by intel - ligent students of American trade , of whatever economic persuasion .

		It makes a calm appeal , expressed in untechnical words , to the daily experience of the ordinary citizen .

		Briefs on New Books .

		A modern book on ^ or nearly a generation , the Eng - the Philosophy lisli translation of
Rosencranz 's of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		`
Philosophy of Education	ORGANIZATION	, ' a treatise written from an exclusively Hegelian standpoint in
1848	DATE	, has been the only work in its field accessible to the American student .

		This fact gives interest to any attempt to develop the subject from a distinctively modern evolutionary standpoint .

		Such an attempt has been made by Dr.
H. H. Home	PERSON	of
Dartmouth	LOCATION	, in a volume with the same title , now before us .

		The different chapters of the book discuss education in its various phases , such as disciplines , biology , physiology , sociology , psy - chology , and philosophy .

		Under each of these heads are epitomized the doctrines currently accepted in scientific circles , in a clear and sys - tematic manner .

		In the chapters treating of the sociological and philosophical aspects of educa - tion , Dr. Home shows considerable originality of 92 THE DIAIi -LSB-
August 10	DATE	, conception ; he is much more at home in this por - tion of the book , as he himself states in the preface , than in the earlier chapters .

		The dis - tinguishing merit of the book is its catholicity ; it avoids close adherence to any one school of edu - cational theory , and is wholesomely positive in its positions .

		Some of the applications of the principles to cm-rent problems -- like college ath - letics and elective studies -- are not entirely suc - cessful , owing rather to lack of sufficient data than to any defect in the reasoning or point of view .

		The list of references attached to each chapter is too general and too inexact to be of much service to students .

		Dr. Home has undoubt - edly succeeded not only in supplying a long-felt need , but he has written a work which would be of significance even if there were already other excellent books in the same field .

		The leading ^ r.
Oscar Fay Adams	PERSON	, in his hoys ' ^ schools volume entitled ` Some Famous in
America	LOCATION	.

		American Schools ' -LRB-

Groton	LOCATION	,
Shattuck	PERSON	-LRB-
Minn.	LOCATION	-RRB- , and
Belmont	LOCATION	-LRB-
Calif.	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	begins each of his chapters with an historical account which is decidedly more pic - turesque than comprehensive or enlightening .

		He then describes the social life of the school , its buildings and general out-of-doors environment .

		The book contains many excellent illustrations of school buildings and grounds , as well as much criticism of school architecture .

		The object for Avhich schools are ordinarily supposed to exist -- intellectual development -- is the one subject which the author frankly avoids .

		In his discussion of the social aspects of school life , which is sum - marized in the concluding chapter , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is fearless and just .

		The comparison introduced by implication in one or two instances between these schools and the great public schools of
England	LOCATION	would lead the English reader to form an exag - gerated notion of the part played by the American institutions .

		It may be said , in brief , that the author has produced a readable and fairly accu - rate account of the more superficial features of typical boarding-schools .

		An attempt at That Dr.
Emil Reich	PERSON	is not lack - the psychology ing in confidence in his own of History .

		insight , is made plain by the scope of the small volume that he has recently put forth under the title ` Success Among Nations ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book contains less than three hundred pages of moderate size ; yet in this space the author has found room to pass in review all the prominent nations of the past , to measure and account for their success , and to attempt a survey of ten or twelve of the leading modem nations , to set forth the conditions in each that make for success or failure , and to prophesy its future .

		The book is necessarily very brief and sketchy in its treatment of this vast range of topics , and many of the author 's broad generali - zations and positive conclusions the reader is likely to reject as unwarranted by the facts pre - sented .

		One can not but admire his faith in his re-readings of history and in the hitherto unrec - ognized forces that he perceives in operation .

		Many of his conclusions are acute and stimulat - ing ; yet the reader will want to do some thinking of his own before accepting all of them .

		It may be fair to give a sentence from the preface which discloses the author 's purpose : ` The attempt has been made to initiate the reader into the psycho - logical view of History , by giving , in outline and by means of a few illustrations , a bird 's - eye view of the human forces that have raised some nations to the glory of success , while their absence has prevented other nations from holding their own in the battle for historic existence . '

		The continent of , Prof.
Israel Cook Russell	PERSON	's work
North America	LOCATION	in on
North America	LOCATION	, contributed to asinf/ievoiMwe .

		* ^ ppleton 's ` World Series , ' is somewhat disappointing , and suffers by compari - son with the volumes that have alre ; ady appeared .

		This , however , is through no fault of the author , but rather through that of the editor in assign - ing to him such a stupendous subject for geo - graphical treatment in a volume of 425 pages .

		The
North American Continent	ORGANIZATION	is not only far greater in territorial extent than the other regions of the earth already treated or yet to be dealt with in the series , but it is also greater in the diversity of its various parts ; and thus the com - pleteness of treatment shown in preceding volumes has been impossible in Professor Rus - sell 's book .

		The author 's task has been the more difficult in face of the fact that must seem sur - prising to most readers , that there are vast areas throughout the continent that have not been sur - veyed or mapped , districts , even in the thickly settled portions of the more enlightened coun - tries , of which there is little critical information available , and large portions of
British America	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	that have never been traversed by observant men .

		Under these conditions , the author has been compelled to slight the economic branch of his subject , and to condense dispropor - tionately his treatment of the physical conditions of the continent .

		In the former division of the subject , his chapter on the Aborigines is a brief but clear summing up of the progress made in the solution of ethnological problems presented by the so-called ` Indians , ' and by the Eskimos .

		His chapter on Political Geography is suggestive , but leaves much to be desired .

		In the other division of the subject his chapter on plant-life deals exclusively with forests and forest trees .

		Had his subject been limited to a portion of the conti - nent-the
United States	LOCATION	, for example , -- he might have given us fuller geographical knowledge .

		In his list of books for the use of readers who desire to pursue further studies , it is significant that the greater number are official or semi-official publica - tions of the Gove rnment .

		The question as to which should have preference in
Church 1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , organization , the legal or the purely spiritual and inherent order , has caused much comment and controversy , and was finally settled , in the minds of many , upon the appearance of Professor
Sohm	PERSON	's ` Kirchenreeht , ' some twelve years ago .

		Mr.
Lowrie	PERSON	, however , thinks the ideas there pre - sented not sufficiently known either in this coun - try or abroad ; and his volume is decidedly a work of love as well as a propaganda of new ideas , written , as he says , to serve as an interpre - tation of the work of Professor
Sohm	PERSON	.

		In carry - ing out his task Mr.
Lowrie	PERSON	has shown excellent judgment ; his equipment for it is of the very best , and his work generally is of the type which in time makes information from such a source both sought after and trusted .

		But , as the author himself has perhaps foreseen , the part he takes in the interpretation and translation of
Sohm	ORGANIZATION	is likely to mislead those who have not read that author ; and these are doubtless very many .

		To such , the book will seem neither
Sohm	PERSON	's nor
Lowrie	PERSON	's .

		Although the latter is most conscientious in citing his authority when - ever he acts as a translator , and although
Sohm	PERSON	's spirit is felt to pervade the book , Mi ' .

		Lowrie has appropriated but a small portion of
Sohm	ORGANIZATION	, ajid has substituted discussions of his own which do not always harmonize with the writer he has quoted .

		The divergence between the two trends of thought is especially patent in the chapters where Mr.
Lowrie	PERSON	speaks of the ` Charisma of Teaching ' and the ` Eucharistic Assembly . '

		The book , with all its merits , becomes in many respects a blending of methods neither quite natural nor congenial .

		To be in partnership with an authority of
Sohm	PERSON	's intellectual stature is at best a handicap , and we are disposed to think the author would do better in a work where he is standing on his own ground .

		His book has , how - ever , its special appeal in the loving interest it manifests in the primitive forms of the early Church , which in their beautiful simplicity and ardor of spirit put to shame our present coolness and stereotyped habits of worship .

		Mrs.

China	LOCATION	' -LRB-
George Bell	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- was written ` to help the amateur in the early stages of his study and the average collector who wishes to become more fully acquainted with his possessions , ' rather than to add to the knowledge of the con - noisseur .

		So far as English wares are concerned -- and only English chinas are considered -- the book will be a real boon to those for whom it is intended , for it is briefly explicit with regard to pastes , glazes , and other fundamental matters , and gives sound advice about collecting , and warnings against fraud .

		Unfortunately , no book can follow the laboratory method , but it would be difficult for the printed page to come nearer than Mrs.
Hodgson	PERSON	's to placing the pieces of this ` frail furniture ' in one 's hands .

		A brief history of each of the English factories is given , with clear descriptions of the designs , colors , and workmanship which characterized each period .

		Cuts of the various markings furnish an unmis - takable guide where such markings exist , and fine points of distinction are cited to help in identifying the different styles when markings were not used .

		Mrs.
Hodgson	PERSON	confesses , however , that there are times when even the most expert collector follows wandering fires , and can not be sure of his tea-cup .

		The forty full-page illus - trations are most bewitching in their display of
Wedgewood	ORGANIZATION	,
Chelsea	LOCATION	,
Derby	ORGANIZATION	,
Worcester	LOCATION	, and all others ; but the beauty is not allowed to become bewildering , for text and illustrations are care - fully correlated .

		The obdurate anti-faddist should be careful not to let his eye rest on these pages , for he would be in danger of falling , like
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, into the state in which `
China	LOCATION	's the passion of his soul ; A cup , a plate , a dish , a bowl , Can kindle wishes in his breast .

		America is rich in these treasures , her annals containing the names of many men who , on sea or land , have shown the qualities that we call heroic , and have done deeds , perhaps not very great in them - selves , that the instinct of the people has fastened upon and incorporated into our national hero tales .

		One of these heroes of our earlier national history is
James Lawrence	PERSON	, whose last cry , ` Do n't give up the ship , ' is known to every schoolboy .

		A biographv of Captain
Lawrence	PERSON	has been added to the series of the lives of `
American Men of Energy	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , written by Lieutenant-Commander
Albert Cleaves	PERSON	.

		The work seems to have been done with painstaking care and with skill , and the reader is carried along by his interest in the man and in the events of the wars with
Tripoli	LOCATION	and with
England	LOCATION	.

		Inci - dentally , the method of naval warfare of those days is clearly pictured , and the striking contrast between the little war-ships of that time and the huge masses of complicated machinery that now make up the navies of the world is of almost startling interest .

		109 Adams Street ,
CHICAGO	LOCATION	The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Was the pioneer American trail west of the
Missouri	LOCATION	river , and the results of that exploration of 1804-6 were of tremendous importance to the
United States	LOCATION	, and they were never more apparent than now .

		A publication relating to the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition , just issued by
Q. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ,
New York	LOCATION	, stands peculiarly alone .

		This edition is a two volume , 8vo one , called • ' The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, 1804-1904 . ''

		The author , Mr.
Olin D. Wheeler	PERSON	, is the well known writer of the popular Wonderland series of the
Northern Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	, in connection with which he made his studies and researches for this work .

		Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	has travelled several thousand miles over the route of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		He has camped out , climbed mountains , followed old Indian traUs , and visited remote points made memorable by those explorers .

		Their route across the Bitterroot mountains has been followed , identified , and mapped .

		`` The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' is illustrated in color and half tone from paintings , drawings , and maps , by
Paxson	ORGANIZATION	,
DeCamp	ORGANIZATION	, and
Russell	PERSON	, made under Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	's direction , and from photographs taken specially for the purpose .

		The writer tells his own story , and supplements it with pertinent extracts from
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, and a host of other historical and narrative writers that connect the past with the present .

		Exact experts and photographic reproductions , in half-tone , from the ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	are given .

		A chapter is devoted to the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, another to the preparatory measures for the exploration , and another to the history of each man of the expedition so far as known , including a discussion of the death of Captain
Lewis	PERSON	.

		The
Louisiana	LOCATION	Purchase Exposition at
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Centennial to be held at
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, in
1905	DATE	, make this work peculiarly timely because written from the standpoint of actual knowledge of past and present conditions of the old trail and country .

		`` * The Trail of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' should be found in every public and private library in the land , and the general reader will find in reading through its pages of large , clear type that truth is , indeed , stranger than fiction .

		The book can be ordered through any bookseller or news stand , or direct from the publishers .

		IN wholly different vein from the author 's last novel , '' The Right of Way , '' comes this exquisite romance , delightful in conception , swift and compelling in interest , and written in the finished style of this great novelist .

		The story recounts the love of two Huguenot refugees , their fugitive life on the island of
Jersey	LOCATION	in the British Channel .

		Later the scene changes to
England	LOCATION	, where exciting intrigue and startling situations in the palace of Queen Elizabeth result in repeated dan - gers for the faithful lovers ; but they finally escape the hazardous favor of the great queen and are united .

		The scenes on the island of
Jersey	LOCATION	are of idyllic freshness and beauty , and in the Seigneur of
Rosel	PERSON	, the lord of the island , the author has produced a character of delightful humor and brag - gadocio .

		It is a thoroughly rounded , satisfj-ing story , written with brilliancy and charm of style .

		HARPER & BROTHERS , PUBLISHERS ,
NEW YORK	LOCATION	THE DIAL ^ THE SEEKER BY
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	Author of `` The Spenders '' The author of `` The Spenders '' has here written a powerful novel centering about the modern change in religious belief .

		It opens with a rarely charming description of child-life -- a little girl and two brothers , one of whom can not , even as a child , accept the conventional beliefs of those about him .

		The development of this boy along lines laid down by his own reason ; his conflict with the sturdy , old-fashioned belief of the grandfather who secretly adores him ; the complication which arises from his love for the girl playmate who marries his smug brother ; and the dramatic climax -- all this chain of events makes a story that not only holds the reader but gives him new insight into some of the vital forces which are molding our social life .

		NOTES 122 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 124 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 124 THE MODERN SHORT STORY .

		-LSB- This age can not be accused of a lack of seri - ousness in its attitude toward its literary pro- ductions , as the attention given to the Short Story may prove .

		Whether this attention is justified , and the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	is a mould into which , as some believe , much of our best liter - ary energy is flowing , .

		time of course will show .

		But at all events there has been enough discus - sion already to justify a little more , and this literary form is certainly of sufficient impor - tance to excuse an attempt to answer the ques - tion .

		Is the Short Story a new literary develop - ment , and wherein lies its novelty ?

		In the literary periods before
the nineteenth century	DATE	there is at least one form of short narrative with distinct and definable individu - ality .

		What the Italians called the ` novella / and some English critics the ` anecdote story / is distinguished by a compact plot with a point , a plot which preserves its characteristic fea - tures through innumerable changes of charac - ter and setting , so that like a minted coin it is capable of infinite passage from race to race mthout loss of identity .

		Such a narrative as
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's ' Pardoner 's Tale , ' where two men , who slay two others for gold , are poisoned by the wine the latter bring , is an admirable exam - ple of the novella .

		* The JSTovellino ' and ' The Decameron , ' or any of the collections of East - em stories , may be drawn upon for examples .

		The East was prolific of the ` novella ' ; the Italians , and afterwards the French , mastered it in the West , and gave it distinctive names , of which ` novella ' perhaps has the most pre - cise meaning and may be most safely adopted .

		If you read the chronicles and looser stories of the middle ages , -- the saints ' legends , for exam - ple , -- you can pick it out from the text like wheat-grains from chaff .

		Its distinctive mark is its compact and individual plot .

		For the other tales of these earlier periods , whether the interest lies in character or events , no such relatively precise delimitation is possi - ble .

		` Euth ' or ` Ali Baba ' may be easily broadened .

		Chaucer 's ' Man of Law 's Tale ' is already like St.
Brendan	PERSON	's great fish
Jastoni	PERSON	that tries ' night & dai to pulte his tail in his mouth ac for gretnisse he nemai . '

		If we are to set them apart from longer forms , we must fall back upon Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's indefinite but adequate distinction , as given in his ' Phi - losophy of the Short-story , ' -- unity of impres - sion in the narrower sense , singleness of effect , 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, feimplicity of structure , a certain shortness .

		But defining thus , we may draw no sharp line between tale and romance .

		When the story attains a certain length , and the incidents are arranged in some definite order which leads to the working out of the plot , -- when this plot , to use a figure from sentence structure , becomes complex instead of simple or compound , -- then we begin to call the narrative a romance .

		We may thus conveniently group the short narratives of earlier periods under two heads -LCB- the latter subject to much subdivision -RRB- , and 80 compare them with our own productions .

		Is tlie first group , the novella , wholly identified with our typical Short Story ?

		Certainly not ; for some of the most characteristic of Short Stories place no dependence upon the plot -- read *
Markheim	PERSON	' for an example , -- while the plot is the mainstay and foundation of the novella .

		■ Again , can we call our Short Story a simple tale of character or of incident , and group it with `
Ruth	PERSON	' and `
Ali Baba	PERSON	' ?

		No again ; for like the novella , these tales are written with an eye upon character aud incident only , while in the Short Stories of the past seventy years there is a new interest to be reckoned with .

		Aldrich ,
Stockton	PERSON	, and
Bunner	PERSON	have given us excellent examples of the novella ; but the best plots are used up , not adapted to squeamish tastes , or serving a new purpose .

		Writers are busy , too , with simple tales of character , or of event without particular ingenuity of plot .

		Good stories , like those of
Irving	LOCATION	, of
Tieck	PERSON	, of
Scott	LOCATION	, belonged in this class ; and thousands of stories in our newspapers and hundreds in our maga - zines -LRB- most of them poor -RRB- belong there to-day .

		But these are not typical Short Stories .

		Exam - ine them -- they seem old-fashioned now and are e & sily distinguished .

		Each one will be found to be based either upon a series of events interesting in themselves , or upon a series of events interesting because they bring out a char - acter or characters .

		The interest in a contrast between two characters , or in the relation between a man and the circumstances in which he is placed -- the interest , in a word , in situa - tion -- is rare in these tales , is rarely if ever the motive behind the story .

		In the short narrative of to-day it is most common ; in the typical Short Story it is pre - vailing .

		It was not the situation that inter - ested the author of `
Ruth	PERSON	, ' it was the simple love-story ; and he tells it with his eye upon the sequence of events .

		It was not the love-story which most interested Kipling in ' The Brush - wood Boy ' ; it was the strange situation between lovers who knew each other only in dreams , and for that situation , not for their love and marriage , he works out the story .

		The greater number of the most famous Short Story writers of the nineteenth centurj ^ show by their stories that it was a situation which usually inspired them .

		Indeed , a glance through the pages of Kipling ,
Maupiassant	LOCATION	,
Harte	PERSON	,
James	PERSON	, will perhaps be enough to show that interest in situation is typical of the characteristic Short Story .

		A situation may be recorded by a simple series of events arranged with the plot alone in view ; but , since this situation itself is a result and not a process , such an incremental method must be crude .

		The writer of the
Short Story	ORGANIZATION	is impressed by the situation , as
Hawthorne	PERSON	so often was , and it is most natural that he should attempt to convey the impression he has received by making it the effect of his story .

		Theoretically , this is the logical method .

		A study of modem Short Stories shows that it is the practical one .

		In most of them the plot is interesting , but the total effect , as in
Steven	PERSON	- son 's ' A Lodging for the
Night	TIME	, ' is after all the impression of a certain situation .

		Consider for an instant ` Youth , ' a story recently pub - lished by Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		This is the narrative of a youth who from boyhood has longed to see the
East	LOCATION	, the wonderful mystic East .

		He is in his first responsible position , -- mate of the '
Judea	LOCATION	, ' bound for
Bankok	LOCATION	.

		The ship is fated .

		Storms unfit her .

		She returns to port again and again , yet always his desire for the East and the romance of his going there sustain him .

		On the high seas at last , she crawls through the tropics .

		Months pass by , yet his eagerness suffers no abatement .

		But the ship is doomed .

		The cargo of coal ignites .

		They fight the smoke day after day .

		The flames burst forth .

		At last they desert the ship , and somewhere off
Java	LOCATION	take to the boats .

		At night they enter a dim harbor , tie at a wharf , and fall asleep at the thwarts .

		The youth awakes at daylight .

		A row of faces , brown and yellow , are staring at him ' without a murmur , without a sigh , without a movement . '

		Behind them , brown roofs of hidden houses peeped ` through the big leaves that hung shining and still . '

		And ' this was the East of the ancient naviga - tors , so old , so mysterious . '

		His ship is gone , and his plight is desperate ; but he has attained the desire of his youth .

		When the plot of this story is stated after the manner of ' The Decameron , ' it is merely this : A youth desires to go to a certain place , and after many delays gets there .

		In short , it is scarcely a plot at all ; it has no distinct point , and it is of importance only in so far as it serves a purpose that is something more than to make the story move for the sake of the narra - tive .

		The writer has conceived , not a story , but a situation .

		The aim of his narrative is to create in his reader 's mind a vivid impression
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 103 of the desire of a boy for the wonders of the unknown East ; and it does so with complete success .

		And this story is only a striking exam - ple of what may be found to a greater or less degree in dozens of stories by
Poe	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	,
Maupassant	LOCATION	,
Ooppee	LOCATION	,
Verga	PERSON	,
Tourgenieff	PERSON	, and other writers of our period If you analyze ^ The Cask of Amontillado , ' ' The Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' The White Old Maid , ' ' Markheim , ' ` Little Tobrah , ' * La Peur , ' ' Un
Lache	PERSON	, ' ' Garassim , ' you will find that the author has a situation in mind , and is endeavoring to convey it to you ; that to this attempt the purely narrative interest is at least subordinate ; and that all the elements of the story are nicely calculated to produce the .

		proper impression .

		In some of
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's stories the plot is absolutely negligible ; and this we should expect of the French , whose tradition of short-story writing has given them a handi - cap in this development .

		The conscious purpose to convey an impres - sion is not implied by Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's formula , which defines the Short Story by a certain unity of impression . '

		Eip Van
Winkle	PERSON	' would be explained and classified by such a definition , because the simplicity and restraint of its form produces a single impres - sion of narrative unity .

		A single impression of narrative unity belongs also to ^ Youth ' ; but this story has what ' ^ Rip ' has not , a conscious attempt to convey an impression of a situation which is the nucleus of the story .

		In '
Rip Van Winkle	PERSON	, ' Irving is interested to some extent in situation , but much more in the series of events .

		And if one should rewrite '
Rip Van Winkle	PERSON	, ' intending to convey an impression of the pathos of Rip 's situation alone among strangers , a very different story would be the result .

		The story that has unity , restriction , and therefore a sin - gle effect , is not the same as the story with unity , restriction , and an attempt to convey an impression of a situation , although the term ' short story ' is used fitly to cover both .

		Such a purpose in story-writing makes unity and sin - gleness of effect inevitable .

		In the old tales , these were attained because the incident treated of was single ; or if there were a number of epi - sodes , the narrative pointed to a speedy conclu - sion and could he brought into a small com - pass .

		In the best of the modern Short Stories , the writer -LRB- to repeat -RRB- has conceived not a story but a situation , and employs his narrative merely to impress this upon the reader .

		There - fore , be the story of one episode , like ' A Cow - ard , ' or , like ` Without Benefit of Clergy , ' of many , of well-jointed plot or of none at all , the impression must be unified , vivid , and dis - tinct from that ffiven bv the novel .

		In an essay by the present writer , first pub - lished in
1902	DATE	and now prefacing a recently published collection of stories , there is an attempt to trace the development of this impres - sionistic purpose .

		The development may be neglected here in order to emphasize more strongly than heretofore its cause , an interest - ing situation , and its result , a definite literary form .

		Here is something tangible and some - thing new .

		This interest in situation , which culminates in an attempt to carry over to the reader what the writer has felt , is a spirit per - vading the writing of our short stories .

		It is this spirit we must seek if we would discover what is the characteristic quality of a typical Short Story .

		This Short Story will belong to no rigidly separated class , like the sonnet or the ballad .

		Yet , when the impressionistic purpose has full sway , it does give us a new type of narrative ; and even when it simply influences the story , it stamps a hallmark upon it .

		It is this spirit , therefore , which is to be sought for , rather than subtle and most often doubtful distinctions in form .

		The term ` short story , ' in spite of its gen - eral sense , has come to have a specific meaning , which covers this new story of situation , the novella , and all short narratives which make a single impression of narrative unity .

		A new term seems superfluous .

		So far , I have used Short Story -LRB- with both words capitalized -RRB- for the little group of modern narratives inspired and affected to some degree by an impressionis - tic purpose .

		But it is hard to persuade the aver - age mind that capitals and hyphens make old words new ones , and either ' Short Story ' or Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's ' Short-story ' is a poor substitute for a speciflc term , if meant to apply only to the impressionistic stories of a situa - tion , of which we have been speaking .

		These narratives , like the novellas , are ` short stories , ' but even more than the novella do they clamor for a distinctive name .

		` Impres - sion-story ' would at least point clearly to their most striking characteristic .

		If vague , it is all the better fitted to name a literary type markedi only by the appearance of a certain interest and a certain method of conveying it , and therefore set off by no definite bounds .

		The stories so named would include most of the best and most representative of our epoch .

		Other stories , which can not be classified here , nor with the novella , and yet belong to the sihort story as we recognize and have defined it , may be so called .

		Like the novella and impression-story , they will be but special cases of a group .

		Such an arrangement will leave for looser and more rambling narrative , still reasonably short , the word ` tale , ' which as commonly understood has 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, just about that meaning .

		If usage will sanc - tion all of these terms , as it already has sanc - tioned some of them , so much the better for our convenience in writing and speaking of this subject .

		The short story has existed in all literary periods , and has always been reason - ably distinct from the novel , the romance , and the loose tale .

		Just as the Italians took over and developed to its highest excellence one of its forms , the novella , so we , in our attempt to convey a situation with greater vividness , have developed another , the impression - story .

		Perhaps it is the realization of new powers and new eJEfects thus gained which accounts in some measure for that considerable fraction of our literary energy withdrawn in the past century from more pretentious work and expended upon what was once a by-product , a miniature hardly worthy of the artist 's sig - nature .

		Poe was the fount , in English at least , of this kind of impressionism , -- a fact which suggests an interesting comparison .

		Professor
Gummere	PERSON	points out in a recent article -LRB- * Mod - em Philology , ' Odx -RRB- ber ,
1903	DATE	-RRB- that the differ - ence between primitive poetry and artistic poetry lies in their different suggestive powers .

		The primitive is incremental , and builds up its effects step by step .

		Artistic poetry , like
Keats	PERSON	's ' Magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas , in faery lands forlorn , ' is purely suggestive .

		It stirs the imagination , and lets it do the work .

		Perhaps prose fiction is merely following poetrv in this development . '

		The Lady of Shalott ' '' has the method of the impression-story .

		Tennyson forgoes the story of Launcelot and
Elaine	PERSON	, neglects the incremental method , and , by a series of pictures and a certain symbolism , suggests -- what but the pathos and the beauty of unhappy
Elaine	PERSON	, who , wearying of shadows , has found a sting in life 's reality !

		It is significant that
Poe	PERSON	, whose poetry depends as much as any upon the suggestive power , should be a leader in the movement to sacrifice the incremental in story-telling , and to gain the desired effects by means of suggestion .

		The change in thought and feeling which has produced a more subtle , more analytic mind , that shifting of interests which has given the nineteenth century a dis - tinctly individual tone , is the result of some mental evolution which has not been thoroughly analyzed .

		But this new method of story-telling is as dependent upon it , and upon what lies behind it , as nature poetry , or the psychological novel , or any other reflection of man 's mind which is more characteristic of our age than of those which have preceded it .

		The
Taixe Memoirs	ORGANIZATION	.

		* A second volume of
Taine	PERSON	's ` Life and Let - ters , ' in Mrs.
R. L. Devonshire	PERSON	's fluent ren - dering , has recently been offered to the Eng - lish and American public , following the first volume after an interval of two years .

		The anonymous compiler has respected
Taine	PERSON	's hor - ror of pujblicity and of personalities , and has given us , alm ` ost w ^ holly in the great author 's own words , a history of his intellectual and spiritual growth , rather than a picture of the man in his family and social relations -- although these more intimate concerns are nec - essarily touched upon , and in a most pleasing manner , in many of the letters .

		Besides the correspondence , with a few explanatory pages inserted here and there by the compiler , the vol - umes contain occasional extracts from unpub - lished manuscripts , -- notes and memoranda , mostly , of a fragmentary anid suggestive char - acter , with little attempt at literary form .

		But the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim is bet - ter than the vintage of Abiezer .

		This scanty aftermath might well have been added to and made a more prominent feature of the book .

		Bom at
Vouziers	ORGANIZATION	in the Ardennes , in
1828	DATE	,
Hippolyte Adolphe Taine	PERSON	was fortunate both in his parentage and in his birthplace .

		The father , a country lawyer of cultured mind and considerable literary and musical talent , which found exercise in the composition of pretty verses and merry songs that are still remem - bered by his countrymen , had a passionate love of rural scenery , and used often to take his little son with him when , in the discharge of his professional duties , he drove through the beautiful Ardennes woods that add charm to the neighborhood of Vouziers .

		Jt may well have been these drives that implanted and strengthened in the younger
Taine	PERSON	that ardent love of nature , especially of forest scenery , which found frequent expression in his works and correspondence .

		To his father , also , the boy owed his early education ; and when failing health and an early death deprived him of this loving teacher , the lad of thirteen had already laid a solid foundation for the more advanced studies of school and college .

		To his fondly devoted mother he owed , as boy and man , even more than to his father .

		Of the love and sjnn - pathy that held them united to the very last , we read : ♦ Life and
Letters of H. Taine	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 105 ' Nothing was more touching than the deep affection and perfect confidence which united the son to his mother , and we can not give her greater praise than by reproducing the following frag - ment of a will that
M. Taine	PERSON	wrote in
December , 1879	DATE	, a few months before losing her : '' If my mother survives me , my wife and children will remember that for forty years she was my only friend -LSB- here the French amie is more than our friend -RSB- , that she afterwards shared with them the first place in my heart , that her life has been all devotion and tenderness . '' '

		Readers of
Taine	PERSON	will trace in his letters the birth and growth of many of those ideas that found their subsequent fuller expression in his published works .

		These letters , taken in their sequence , present the harmonious and uninter - rupted development of one who , at the early age of fourteen , drew up an elaborate scheme of study from which he never deviated .

		Spi - noza 's motto , ` JAyq to think , ' he made his own . '

		There are certain minds , ' he early wrote , * '' who live confined within themselves , and for whom passions , joys , ' sorrows , and actions are alto - gether inward .

		I am of that number . '

		And again , in later years , speaking of the things of the mind , he said : ' A great idea within a man is like the iron spike that sculptors put in their statues ; it impales and supports him . '

		The extent of his reading as a student was vast , and amazed both his classmates and Ms teachers .

		Plato ,
Aristotle	LOCATION	, and the
Church Fathers	ORGANIZATION	were among his early readings , and he classified and analyzed all he read .

		Taine 's alleged and avowed infidelity -LRB- from the Eoman Catholic point of view -RRB- gives significance to the follow - ing extract from a letter written at the age of twenty : ' Consider , my friend , that this God whose exist - ence seems to me to be mathematically proven , is not the absurd and cruel tyrant taught by relig - ions , and worshipped by the vulgar ; consider also that neither is He Bossuet 's Ood-man , busy saving or destroying empires , and founding His Church ; finally , do not forget that if I believe in Him , it is not because I never doubted , nor from habit or sentiment ; but after reasonings and dem - onstrations more rigorous than those of geometry . '

		Combined with the fresh and contagious enthusiasm of the young seeker for truth was a singularly sober view of human life and des - tiny .

		Long before knowledge of the world had worked its inevitable saddening effect , he wrote : ' Happiness is impossible ; calm is the supreme object of man , and it is unattainable to him who has not attained immutable convictions .

		I have done so ; I have , I say , and my convictions become firmer and more extensive every day .

		I believe that absolute , linked , and geometrical science is possible ; I am working at it and have already advanced two or three well marked steps .

		Some one said that philosophy , like mathematics , had been renovated two or three times , but had never changed -- and that is very true .

		There is .

		a superior point of view from which we embrace the Whole of things and from which we easily unravel all diflBcuIties . '

		Thus early was the student of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	and Spi - noza working out for himself a system of syn - thetic philosophy .

		Again and again he writes to his bosom-friend Prevost-Paradol , counselling him to seek happiness within , to renounce am - bition , to ibeware of the allurements of society . '

		My object , ' he declares , ' is the Good , or the Be - ing , as we used to say in Metaphysics ' ; and he sums up his aspirations in a desire to think much , to discover many new things , to gaze upon and produce objects of beauty , to have food for love and friendship , and to serve others .

		Yet on human love and friendship he would never be dependent . '

		Man , when left alone , ' he writes , ' still has study .

		Art ,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and especially the Infinite , which alone can exhaust that immense power of loving which is in his soul .

		Philoso - phy is indeed a great teacher of love ; it is also a great teacher of resignation . '

		In his books he found balm for sorrow , holding with Mon - tesquieu that half an hour 's reading can make us forget the worst troii -LRB- bles in life .

		This , at any rate , was his belief in early manhood . '

		Try and get my mother too to read a little , ' he coun - sels his sister
Virginie	PERSON	; ' it is the only way of soothing the mind and forgetting troubles . '

		In his somewhat uncongenial sur - roundings at
Nevers	LOCATION	, where he had his first taste of teaching , he rejoiced to find him - self independent of others for enjoyment . '

		I bury myself in philosophy , ' he again writes to the same sister , ^ and -LRB- forgive my fatuity ! -RRB-

		I think myself good enough company not to be bored when alone .

		... I am proud that other men 's amusements do not amuse me .

		I should be unhappy if I saw no other object in my life than the attaining of some rank or other .

		My ambition goes far beyond that . '

		Something of a prig , perhaps it will be said .

		It is true his gayer comrades sometimes poked fun at the serious student , but he appears not to have been unpopular , while he certainly was admired for his extraordinary attainments .

		As might have been expected in one of his austere habits , woman 's charms were suffered to make but slight appeal , and he had passed his fortieth birthday before he married , which he then did largely to please his mother who knew that he must before long lose her companionship .

		Taine 's visits to
England	LOCATION	are of especial inter - est to us , as having to do with the preparation of what is to English and American readers his best-known work , the ' History of English Lit - erature . '

		In confirmation of his early-expressed estimate of the value of books , he writes in the
summer of 1860	DATE	: 106 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, ' At present I am at
Manchester	LOCATION	, where one of my friends is showing me the working classes .

		All I can say is that I have acquired great esteem for literature and the information to be found in it ; it seems to me that the judgments which it sug - gested to me in
Paris	LOCATION	were not false ; the sight of things did not belie the views previously formed in my study ; it confirmed , defined and developed them , but the general formulae remain in my opinion entirely the same . '

		English readers will note with approval his remarks on
John Bull	PERSON	's affability and communi - cativeness .

		Unlike other foreign visitors , he found the English of every class admirably free from cold reserve and ready enough to talk and laugh even with strangers . '

		I do not find them duller than the French / he declares , ' ^ and I should say they are as civil . '

		This speaks vol - umes for the personal charm
Taine	PERSON	must have possessed .

		But far better than anything a reviewer can say about
Taine	PERSON	or his .

		letters are those letters themselves .

		Let us re-cross the Channel with him and hear what he has to say about
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	. '

		A tall , vigorous man , with square shoulders , a thick moustache and a heavy appearance , not unlike a somewhat worn Cavalry officer , who has become addicted to tippling .

		Ponderous strength is the main feature of his conversation , tone and gestures .

		There is nothing refined about him , but a great frankness and naturalness ; he is a primi - tive man , a '' dreamer '' and a '' savage '' ; these two last words are his own .

		He is an obstinate toiler who strains his imagination and has to suffer the consequences .

		He seldom goes out in the evenings , and works a great deal at night , in a large , well warmed , lonely room , very noisily , '' howling , per - spiring and drinking water , '' he says .

		When inspiration comes , he hardly eats or sleeps at all , but wakes up in the night to write . ''

		My whole body is not too much to write with ! ''

		... After times of excitement come times of depres - sion ; he remains inert , lying on a sofa , '' like a brute '' horribly miserable . '

		And more , equally interesting , follows .

		From
Taine	PERSON	's pen-portraits of
Sainte Beuve	PERSON	, whom he delighted to honor , and whom he addressed as master , and of
Eenan	LOCATION	, with whom also he was on terms of intimacy , brief extracts must be taken . '

		Sainte Beuve has every moral quality , even modesty .

		He says : '' I am very ignorant , I have learnt nothing ; I only seem up to date because I have met several specialists ! ''

		... He is natu - rally timid , but becomes bolder through convic - tion and reflection .

		Youth is coming to him now at fifty-five years of age .

		The first impression that he produces is that of timidity ; he speaks gently , in a low , insinuating voice ; some of his syllables are almost indistinct .

		He is not unlike a fat priest or a large , prudent-looking cat .

		He has a bald head , with a pale , irregular , somewhat Chi - nese face , small , mocking eyes , and a sugary smile ; altogether the aspect of a worldly ecclesiastic , suddenly transformed by lightning outbursts of frankness and firmness of belief . '

		` Renan is perfectly incapable of precise for - mulae ; he does not go from one precise truth to another , but feels his way as he goes .

		He has impressions , a word which expresses the whole thing ... His process of writing consists in throwing down bits of sentences , paragraph head - ings , here and there ; when he has arrived at the sensation of the whole , he strings it all into one .

		.

		.

		Renan is not a society man ; he does not know how to talk with ladies , but only with spe - cialists .

		He lacks the talent of intriguing , of seiz - ing opportunities .

		He is , before everything else , a man of one idea , the priest of a God .

		He prides himself justly enough on this fact . '

		Passing to matters more abstract , a para - graph on style is worth quoting , as the utter - ance of a master .

		` This constitutes style : to have a refined and passionate soul , capable of irohy , enthusiasm , hatred , admiration , to pass in the course of one page through twenty shades of emotion , to put fifty different intonations into fifty succeeding sen - tences , and to transfer those successive states exactly into the reader 's mind -- there is talent , or genius .

		Whoever can do so is a writer , whether he be a biographer , a ^ poet , a novelist , an orator or a philosopher . '

		Of German culture , literature , art , our French , critic has but a poor opinion .

		He sees too much of the self-conscious and labored in the
Teuton	LOCATION	's acliievement .

		The German seems to him to say to his countrymen : ' We are not cultured ; let us obtain culture ; let us create artists , writers , poets , a unified State , etc ' This is stroking Art the wrong way .

		Even Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	he can not heartily admire .

		Of the ungainliness of German prose , and of certain grammatical peculiarities of the lan - guage , he speaks as a Frenchman may be ex - pected to speak , but with a few unexpected and astonishing errors of fact , possibly the result of haste rather than ignorance .

		Yet with all this distaste for things Teutonic , he came within a little of giving us a work on German litera - ture of the nineteenth century , including the latter part of the eighteenth .

		The outbreak of the war of
1870	DATE	, however , interrupted his preparations , and thereafter his intellectual profoity forbade him to write on a subject that he could no longer treat with an unbiased mind .

		To those familiar with
Taine	PERSON	's works , these letters will suggest , if they do not fully illus - trate , some of his more conspicuous merits and defects as a thinker and writer .

		He was before all else a logician , with a logician 's strength and weakness .

		His fondness for generalization and abstraction amounted to a passion . '

		Every man and every book , ' he was wont to assert , ' can be summed up in three pages , and those three pages

		THE DIAL 107 can be summed up in three lines /
Supervis	PERSON	- ing his sister
Sophie	PERSON	's studies , he instructed her to ' write an epitome of your author .

		Write an epitome of your epitome .

		Sum up your second epitome in four or five lines . '

		Thus always on the lookout for essential features and predomi - nant traits , as soon ^ as he thought he had found the one salient quality he massed all available evidence in support of his theory , and slighted or disregarded conflicting testimony .

		Herein he committed the very error for which he blamed the classicists : he was too fond of portraying the type , too enamored of the beauty of a general truth .

		In philosophy
Taine	PERSON	was , as he avows himself in these letters , an inexora - ble determinist .

		Yet he exalts the power of the will , in himself and in others , to make and re - make the man .

		-LRB- See Vol .

		II. , p. 210 . -RRB-

		To his countrymen of the sixties he was the spokes - man of positivism .

		In one of his letters he clearly asserts that ` nothing exists but phe - nomena , ' and in another he all but calls himself a positivist .

		But notwithstanding his determi - nism and positivism , his devotion to science and logic , he showed in his thought and in its expression a wonderful imaginative power that allied him to the romantic school which , as the advocate of scientific method , he so vigorously assailed .

		In fact he was , as
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	has • called him , a poet-logician .

		He had a remarka - ble faculty for dramatizing abstractions , as another French critic has said of him .

		To use
M. Bourget	PERSON	's expression , he had what may be called a philosophic imagination .

		Of the translator 's part in this important work , little but good is to be said .

		Yet occa - sional errors are apparent even without the French original before one .

		A word is some - times too hastily rendered by one identical in form , as ' chariot wheels ' where nothing more dignified than ` cart wheels ' appears to be in - tended .

		The definite article is here and there translated where our idiom requires its omission .

		Sheer nonsense even has found its way into the translation , as at the bottom of page 72 of the first volume .

		Three pages before , ' quarrels which refine the mind ' must be a false render - ing .

		But in general the English runs on with little to remind us that we are not reading the author 's very words .

		We have followed
Taine	PERSON	down to the out - break of the Franco-German war , when he was forty-two years old .

		This should have been only the early prime of his strength and pro- ductiveness ; but his death at sixty-five indi - cates a too strenuous devotion to work in earlier life -- or , perhaps with greater probability , con - genital defect of some sort , his father before him having died young .

		However , between forty - two and sixty-five are twenty-three good years .

		in many respects the best years of his life ; and the prospect of a third volume , if not also of a fourth , mitigates the regret with which we close the second .

American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		* High approval will be awarded Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's work on '
The American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	' by all who have the time and inclination to read it through .

		To say that such readers may be few in number , is merely to indicate that the book is written by a specialist , chiefly for specialists .

		The ' general reader ' may be pardoned some trepida - tion when he is confronted with the thousand pages that constitute the body of this work , to say nothing of thirty-four pages of ' Contents ' and fifty-eight of ' Index . '

		Let him have cour - age and interest , however , and his diligence will be rewarded , for he will glean a rich garner of scientific investigation in American history .

		It is the particular service of this work to gather into one connected whole the scattered contributions made of late years by scholars all over this country and in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is a history of the Colonies from the standpoint of our latest knowledge , as
Bancroft	LOCATION	's was from that of his day .

		The author very rarely refers by name and title to monographs or books by other writers , perhaps for two reasons : first , because an exhaustive bibliography would have added to the already great size of the work ; and secondly , because Professor
Osgood	PERSON	writes from a personal acquaintance with the sources .

		There is little reference to unpublished manu - scripts , -- a fact which perhaps explains the somewhat less clear and definite discussion of the Southern provinces , the records of which are still to a great extent unpublished .

		To cite one example , several of the county-court records of
Maryland	LOCATION	still exist , but have never been put into print .

		One can hardly approach the criticism of ' The
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	' without a reference to Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's previous services in his chosen field .

		Certain articles , appearing from time to time in the ` Political Science Quar - terly , ' the ` American Historical Review , ' and the `
American Historical Association Reports	ORGANIZATION	, ' elaborated first a re-statement of the principles by which the English colonies in
America	LOCATION	should be classified , and , secondly , a descrip - tion of the institutio ns of the various groups ♦ The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Cen - tury .

		-LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in accordance with this classification .

		This same task is now attempted on a larger scale ; and wMle most of the material is new , one finds pages , and at least one whole chapter , which have appeared in some of these earlier forms .

		Not merely amplification of illustration , but also re-statement of principles , marks the pres - ent work .

		In his former essays , and to some degree here , the author has attacked with vigor the classic division into Charter ,
Royal	ORGANIZATION	, and Proprietary colonies .

		In this criticism two points were urged : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the use of ` char - ter ' was unscientific and did not classify , because the proprietary colonies also had char - ters ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the classification neglected the real differences between the groups , which are the differences in internal organization .

		Tried by this better test , -- the internal organization of each of the colonies , -- they may be divided into corporate colonies and provinces ; while the latter may be subdivided into royal and proprie - tary provinces .

		• Now , in the corporate colony the powers of government are in the hands of a corporation , the freemen or full members of whicih are citizens of the commonwealth , and vice versa .

		.

		The executive , the legislative , and the Judicial officers all are elected , and laws are enacted , by this larger membership or its representatives ; and government thus comes from below .

		This principle is best illustrated in the Constitution of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	colony from
1629	DATE	to
1684	DATE	; while the other Puritan colonies of
New England	LOCATION	followed the same model .

		In the provinces , on the contrary , government proceeds from above downwards ; that is , the officers derive their power and the people their rights from the grant of the
King	LOCATION	.

		In the royal provinces this is developed directly by commissions and instructions from the Crown to royal officials ; in the proprietary provinces such powers are vested in the proprie - tor , who thus to a great extent stands in place of the
King	LOCATION	.

		The only real difference between the two forms of province lies in this inter - position of the proprietor with quasi-regal powers .

		This new classification possesses elements of permanent value .

		We are not surprised , how - ever , to find that Professor
Osgood	PERSON	has some - what modified his earlier presentation .

		While still emphasizing the distinction between the corporation and the province , he now lays more stress on the possession of charters , whether by a corporation or by a proprietor ; and he also recognizes and makes perfectly plain that in early years the corporation was a proprietor .

		The sub-title of these two volumes , -- ` The Char - tered Colonies ; Beginnings of Self-Govem - ment , ' -- explains why accounts of
Virginia	LOCATION	after
1624	DATE	, of
Maryland	LOCATION	from
1689	DATE	to
1715	DATE	, and of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	after
1684	DATE	, are not included here ; and therefore we welcome the author 's promise of another part of his work , which shall deal with the royal provinces , and with the colonies from the standpoint of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		This promise of a wider outlook suggests our first stricture upon the present instalment .

		Even in dealing with local insti - tutions , it would be profitable to widen the field of comparison to other English colonies than those which later formed the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The two volumes before us comprise three parts .

		In Volume I. , after the excellent intro - duction .

		Part I. treats of ' The Proprietary Province in its Earliest Form . '

		Four chapters suffice to describe the beginnings of coloniza - tion , the chartered stock-companies , and the constitutional history of
Virginia	LOCATION	to
1624	DATE	.

		The discussion of the three
Virginia	LOCATION	charters is particularly clear and helpful .

		The author avoids the
John Smith	PERSON	controversy and Mr.
Alexander Brown	PERSON	's thesis that
Smith	PERSON	was but the mouthpiece of a royal conspiracy against the Company .

		Smith , Professor
Osgood	PERSON	thinks , was ` by instinct a good colonizer , ' but of ` events and views which for their authority rest wholly on the Map and Generall Historie ... it is necessary to speak hypothetically ' -LRB- Vol .

		An important addi - tion to our previous information is found in the instructions of
1609	DATE	to Sir
Thomas Gates	PERSON	, recently brought to light by
Miss Kingsbury	PERSON	, among the
Ashmolean MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are carefully outlined by Pro- fessor
Osgood	PERSON	, who thinks that the author was probably Sir
Edwin Sandys	PERSON	himself -LRB- Vol .

		The transition of
Virginia	LOCATION	from proprietary to royal government removes this colony from further consideration ; and , after a very lucid chapter on the
New England Council	ORGANIZATION	, the rest of the volume is devoted to the Corporate Colo - nies of
New England	LOCATION	.

		This constitutes Part I .

		Here again the story is excellently told , `` wdth a definiteness painfully lacking in other writers .

		The tone of these chapters is emi - nently fair , and controversial questions , such as judgment of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	' treatment of religious dissent , are handled without acrimony or apology .

		Thus , in concluding his accounts of Mrs.
Hutchinson	PERSON	's expulsion , he says : ' By the attitude which they assumed toward the so-called Antinomian opinions the magistrates and clergy of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	definitely committed themselves to a close alliance for the purpose of upholding a system of strict orthodoxy .

		Tenden - cies which were operative when the religious test was enacted and when
Roger Williams	PERSON	was ban - ished , now came fully to prevail .

		109 synod , from the clergy and magistrates in fre - quent conference , and from the general court as the highest expression of power in the colony , to keep local congregations and individuals alike in harmony with the doctrines and practices of the majority .

		From this union and resolve proceeded the body of legislation on ecclesiastical and moral subjects which has already been outlined .

		All parties must expressly or tacitly accept this , must yield it at least outward obedience , or leave the colony .

		Protest , whether by speech or action , was rigorously suppressed , and the secular power was resorted to for the purpose without hesita - tion .

		The life and thought of this colony and of other colonies , so far as its influence could be made to contest them , was cast in one narrow Puritan mould , and was not allowed to escape from it .

		So little was there of enlightment in
New England	LOCATION	outside the circle of ideas which the clergy imparted or controlled , that it was possible to maintain strict conformity for sixty years , and a type of thought which was essen - tially Puritan for nearly one hundred and fifty years longer .

		This , with the rigorous adminis - tration and political system which accompanied it , was the result of the appearance of the first learned class within the American colonies , and of its alliance with the secular authorities .

		But , though we consider Puritan
New England	LOCATION	to have been narrow and intolerant , we should remember that the intellectual activity which made even that possible did not exist in the other colonies at the middle of the eighteenth century . '

		The same calmness of judgment which fills this paragraph pervades the whole of the work .

		To the other corporate colonies ,

Connecticut	LOCATION	, and
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, are devoted three chapters .

		Gorton 's fantastic career is subjected to less condemnation than one usually finds .

		Very interesting is the story of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	's constitutional growth , which , however , for some imexplained reason , is not carried beyond the granting of the royal charter .

		The interference of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in the north - em settlements ,
Maine	LOCATION	and
Kew Hampshire	LOCATION	, takes up one short chapter .

		Then follows another , upon Intercolonial Relations , in which the history of the
New England Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	is somewhat unnecessarily drawn out .

		Of more striking value is the discussion of the Land Sys - tem in the Corporate Colonies , especially the suggestion as to the importance of land organi - zation and land disputes within the townships -LRB- pp. 466-7 -RRB- .

		Three more chapters on the
Financial System	ORGANIZATION	, the
System of Defense	ORGANIZATION	, and Indian Relations , bring to a close the first vol - ume and the second part of the work .

		In the sixteen chapters of the second volume , which constitutes Part III. , is discussed the development of the Proprietary Province in its later forms .

		The first two and the last five chapters are general in scope , and deal with the Land System , the Judiciary , the
Ecclesias	PERSON	- tical Relations , the Financial System , the Sysi - tem of
Defense	ORGANIZATION	and the Indian Relations of these provinces taken together .

		In addition , one chapter or more is devoted to each province individually .

		By far the most valuable feature of this vol - ume , to the present reviewer 's mind , is the excellent outline of the polity of New Nether - land , the transfer of government to the Eng - lish , and the proprietary regime in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Doyle	PERSON	's scholarly books , satisfactory in their time for the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Southern colonies , have never reached the consideration of those of the middle zone .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's ' ^ Dutch and
Quaker Colonies	ORGANIZATION	' stresses the social and politi - cal sides rather than the institutional .


Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania , indeed , has been adequately treated in many monographs , but there has been nota - bly lacking a good compact outline of the insti - tutional development of
New York	LOCATION	.

		This we now have , and here , perhaps , Professor
Osgood	PERSON	is most upon his own ground .

		Beginning with the proprietary rule of the
Dutch West India Company	ORGANIZATION	, the course of the official system is traced to the English conquest ; the autocracy of the Governors is clearly brought out ; and the quarrels of the Dutch with the Swedes to the south , with the English on
Long Island	LOCATION	, and with the
New England	LOCATION	colonies , are made thoroughly intelligible .

		The transition to Eng - lish government , the status of the colony under the rule of the latter , and the policy of the
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	with reference to the local legis - lature , make two interesting chapters , in com - parison with which that describing the division and re-division of
New Jersey	LOCATION	seems rather flat .

		In the case of
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's work is paral - leled by several more or lees recent works , and these chapters are perhaps less striking than some of the others .

		As the story proceeds , chapter by chapter , the contrasts between the two groups , -- the corporations and the provinces , -- make them - selves more and more evident .

		In both , the possession of land was important ; but in the corporate colonies the land was usually a sim - ple freehold , while in the provinces many of the characteristics of the fief persisted .

		In the former , the only revenue from the land was that derived by taxation ; in the latter , the land office and proprietary control over quit-rents play a large part .

		The population of the New no THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	,
England	LOCATION	colonies was almost uniformly of Eng - lish stock , and settled in communities ; in the middle and southern provinces the population was of more varied nationality , and the immi - grants came rather as individuals .

		In the
East	LOCATION	, religious uniformity was the expression of a common dissent ; to the southward , diversity of creed was as noticeable as difference in nation - ality .

		Professor
Osgood	PERSON	comments -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 315 , note -RRB- on the similarity in language betM ^ een the charters of
Carolina	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	with reference to the maintenance of ' God 's holy and true Christian religion , ' and the ec - clesiastical authority given to the proprie - tors .

		We wish he had commented also upon the practical identity of parts of the important clauses which authorized toleration in the char - ters of
Carolina	LOCATION	and
Ehode Island	LOCATION	.

		Finally , in the author 's view , the history of the corporation is that of a widening Democracy , that of the provinces recites the struggle of popular gov - ernment against feudal prerogative .

		We await with eagerness the completion of Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's work .

		We shall be deeply interested in his treatment of
Virginia	LOCATION	under the royal government , and in his judgment of the English statesmen of the century , especially
Cromwell	PERSON	and Clarendon .

		Of the effect of the commercial code upon colonial politics , these volumes have little to say ; nor do we learn much of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of
London	LOCATION	.

		The extension of the Eng - lish law , also , remains to be discussed more fully in the subsequent volumes .

		Every true student of American history should consider it an obligation to read this work of Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's .

		Most of all , as we close , let us urge upon any who have it in mind to bring forth text-books on American history for school or college , that it is especially their duty to know from cover to cover this comprehensive and satisfying synthesis of historical investigation and criticism .

Napoleon	LOCATION	, were reduced to narrative form by
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	several years ago ; but , as he explains in his preface , ' the publication by the Great German General Staff of the early volumes of its extensive trea - tise on the Prussian King has interrupted the chronological sequence of this history ' ; and the author has decided to await the completion of that monumental work in order to avail himself of its many additions to the store of available facts .

		This series of military biographies is the magnum opus of
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's honorable career ; and the volume on
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is natur - ally its pars maadma .

		These first two volumes , aggregating 1,200 pages , close with the Eylau and
Friedland	PERSON	campaigns of
1807	DATE	; in the two remaining volumes we may expect equal ful - ness of detail in the treatment of the
Penin	LOCATION	- sular war , the retreat from
Moscow	LOCATION	, the battles round
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		It is easy to pre - dict that this will long remain the standard and definitive authority in English on the Napoleonic wars .

		At the outset , the reader is quietly reminded that ' this work deals with only the military life of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		The political events of this era , or indeed his personality , although replete with interest , can be touched on only so far as they illustrate the art of war or elucidate campaigns . '

		The book thus frankly appeals to students of the military art ; its interest is largely esoteric and technical ; and the general reader will find it pretty close reading .

		Thack - eray speaks of ' the great game of war ' ; Gen - eral
Sherman	PERSON	said , ' War is hell ' ; and in its two aspects of international chess and international surgery -LRB-
Napoleon	PERSON	called a battle an ^ opera - tion ' -RRB- , it is a legitimate and profoundly absorb - ing subject of professional study .

		To these two aspects
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	has resolutely adhered , with the result of simplifying his task and freeing himself in great measure from the necessity of moralizing on or explaining away the darker phases of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		With unrestrained professional enthusiasm , he follows the almost flawless recond of the revo - lution in strategy and lihe ^ far-flung battle line ' wrought by the genius and energy of the Corsican ; and the lay reader , following atten - tively the sharp and precise narrative , aided by abundant maps and diagrams , will perforce admit the thesis as proved , and realize that to the military mind
Napoleon	PERSON	must loom supreme .

		In his first volume .

		Colonel Dodge devotes considerable space to the wars of the
Kevolu	PERSON	- tionary era , before
Bonaparte	PERSON	appeared on the scene .

		THE DIAL 111 and elan which have distinguished the French soldier in all campaigns , successful or unsuc - cessful .

		Bonaparte built high , and strong ; but he found the foundation already laid .

		As the author sayS ; , -- ' The French soldier was , in a certain formal sense , not well disciplined , but for the purposes of field work , -- that is , for marching and fight - ing , -- his discipline was perfect .

		What is usually understood by pipe-clay did not exist .

		What the little French infantryman is today , he was then .

		Far from being well set up , far from having the grand military air , he was yet hard as nails , will - ing , able to march , and ever ready to fight .

		If discipline be divided into garrison and field dis - cipline , of the former he had little , of the latter he had much .

		The
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Boulogne	LOCATION	had much pipe-clay to boast of .

		The
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	after Austerlitz had little .

		It was not a parade - army , but it was a fighting machine .

		Whoso re - members the travel-stained , often ill-clothed and ill-equipped soldiers of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac and the Western armies , who paraded through
Washington	LOCATION	at the end of the Civil War , will understand what is meaiit by the above .

		Whosio has been a part of those noble bodies will appre - ciate it still more keenly .

		Any
State	ORGANIZATION	could have turned out a militia regiment which in appear - ance and minor tactics would have shamed those veterans of four years and hundreds of pitched battles .

		But he who had served with them could recognize that every musket was in order and every sabre sharp , and that the men knew how and were ready to use their weapons .

		Among all the troops the world has seen it is doubtful whether one hundred thousand men could have been collected from any source equal for intel - ligence and all-round soldierly qualities combined , to the one hundred thousand that might have been chosen from the men who passed before
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	on that two days ' national review .

		After such fashion must we judge the common soldier of the -LRB- Napoleonic -RRB- Grand Army ; he was not handsome to - look at , but he was untiring on the march and terrible in battle .

		If he was wanting in military discipline , this was more than made up by his war discipline . '

		These words of praise for the essential qualities which are the root of the matter in war may instructively be compared with recent criticisms in various quarters of the German army of to-day , -- ^ aidmittedly the greatest fighting - machine of modem times , -- ^ and the insinua - tion that it is drilled to death , a victim of excessive pipe-clay and obsolescent tactics .

		The author , following Wartenburg , divides
Napoleon	PERSON	's military career into three periods ; the first , lasting till
March , 1796	DATE	, ` comprises the years when he was only one general out of many , and when in what he did he was com - pelled to pay heed to the ideas and prejudices of others , being hedged and hampered accord - ingly .

		In the second period -LRB- ending with the establishment of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	, 18th Brumaire ,
1799	DATE	-RRB- he was in sole command of his army , but had behind him a government which controlled the resources , and from which he must receive general orders .

		The third period -LRB- lasting to
Waterloo	LOCATION	,
1815	DATE	-RRB- is that in which all the resources of
France	LOCATION	were in his sole control , and he could act as he saw fit . '

		Along the first two of the periods and well into the third we are carried , on a journey whose milestones bear the names

		That the reader is enabled to hold out to the end is of course partly due to the undying fascination of the theme and the hero ; but also , too , to the lucidity and painstaking thoroughness of the treatment .

		Neither the making nor the read - ing of such a book is a holiday sport ; but Colo - nel
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	has handled his immense materiel with skill and a sense of proportion ; and lias added every facility for lightening our task .

		The story of every campaign is illustrated with numerous maps and plans ; and to eadh chapter is prefixed , in smaller type , a useful half-page summary of its contents , for the benefit of those who must do some skipping .

		The author 's resolution to confine himself to the military career of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, eschewing men - tion or criticism of his manners , morals , or politics , is generally well kept ; but in the nar - rative of several famous -- or infamous -- acts , he allows himself a few words of comment , usually of an apologetic nature .

		To what extent these may avail in each case , we must leave to the readers who are unbiassed by ` necessity , the tyrant 's plea ' to determine .

		For example , in speaking of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	's giving

		Yet the lives sacrificed at
Pavia	LOCATION	saved multitudes that by any other treatment would have been else - where lost ; an example was needed if the French were to hold
Lombardy	LOCATION	, which they had fairly conquered , and
Bonaparte	PERSON	delayed not , neither shrank from extreme measures in giving it . '

		Probably no act of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's has brought more odium upon his name than the massacre of the 2,000 prisoners at
Jaffa	LOCATION	in
1799	DATE	.

		Colo - nel
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	admits that ' from an ethical point of view , the act was no doubt unpardonable ' ; but claims that ` from a military standpoint it was a necessity .

		Salvs exercitus summa lex . '

		The execution of the Due d'Enghien is called -LRB- II. , 134 -RRB- an ` unfortunate episode , in which the act of over-zealous police officers was sus - tained by
Napoleon	PERSON	's license or at least indif - ference . '

		The strong ^ t words of disapproval 112 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, are reserved for the behavior of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	at Sans Souci in 180G : ' `` While
Napoleon	PERSON	reverently uncovered his head when he stepped within the portal of the narrow
Potsdam	LOCATION	vault , where beside his testy but honest father rest the ashes of this great man , he whose lineage and character were incomparably lower than those of the dead hero could yet not refrain from taking
Frederick	PERSON	's sword and belt , to send to the Invalides ... These relics , essentially Prussian , belonged at Sans Souci .

		Napoleon would have done himself credit by leaving them where they had so long been .

		But he was : a new-born emperor as
Frederick	PERSON	had been a tme-born king .

		The main thought of the one was for himself ; the other 's only thought had ever been for his people . '

		At the very beginning of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	's career as a leader , his genius for combination , celerity , and fierce attack justifies all of
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's eulogy , and has indeed been the world 's wonder for a century .

		He promptly repudiated the antiquated ` cordon ' theory of long lines of defense , always took the initiative , and won his astonishing victories by adhering to his cardi - nal principle of always ' having more men than the enemy at the point of fighting contact .

		So soon as he had divided the allies , he held one with small forces and advanced in mass against the other .

		In what he did resided the whole theory of modern war ... To be their superior in numibers at the point of fighting contact is the basis of
Napoleon	PERSON	's conduct of war ; but it requires a Napoleonic coup d'oeil , speed , and decision to carry it out . ' '

		Nothing is more marked in the whole
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic military scheme , ' remarks the author , Hhan the intimate knowledge possessed by the Emperor of just how to use the national charac - ter in accomplishing results . '

		It is in this light that we must read the bombastic proclamations and orders of the day with which he was wont to fire the Gallic temperament of his men ; they accomplished their purpose . '

		In these little addresses the troops were usually told something about what was to be done .

		The French soldier had not the feeling that he was driven to battle ; he was led to think the task before him an easy one and the risk small ... During our Civil War the cry of '' Boys , we have beaten them before , and we can beat them again ! ''

		was a not uncommon incentive to victory .

		So the French soldier , fired by his emperor 's words and his captain 's friendly and stirring address , entered into the conflict with the feeling that he would certainly emerge from it the victor . '

		Colonel Dodge frequently cites , as the require - ments to produce a great captain , exceptional intellect , exceptional character , and exceptional opportunity .

		These in full measure he attrib - utes to
Alexander	PERSON	,
Hannibal	LOCATION	,
Caesar	LOCATION	,
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	,
Frederick	PERSON	, and
Napoleon	PERSON	-- the chosen six .

		To that first rank he will not admit
Marlborough	LOCATION	, nor
Wellington	LOCATION	-LRB- in spite of
Waterloo	LOCATION	-RRB- , nor Grant ; though he has high praise for them all .

		And so of
Napoleon	PERSON	's famous marshals , he says : ' That they possessed in a very high degree the practical side of the art is unquestionable .

		How many of them were actually imbued with the divine part of the art will ever remain a question .

		Left to themselves in
Spain	LOCATION	, they failed to succeed , some of them even against regular Spanish troops .

		That they could not succeed against
Wellington	LOCATION	, who was a man of an entirely different stamp and who as a leader of men vastly outshone them all , is not to be wondered at . '

		It was after
Austerlitz	PERSON	-LRB-
Dec. 2 , 1805	DATE	-RRB- , in our author 's opinion , that
Napoleon	PERSON	first ' felt sure of himself , ' though it is hard to see how any addition could have been made to the proud self-consciousness justified by Mar - engo -LRB- 1800 -RRB- and Ulm -LRB-
October , 1805	DATE	-RRB- .

		Dur - ing the period covered by these first two vol - umes .

		Napoleon 's star was steadily in the ascendant ; we shall await with interest
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's account and criticism of the reverses which marked the yeare from

		The Beginnixgs of Expansion IN Retrospect .

		* A hundred years ago , the
United States	LOCATION	over - leaped the bounds of English exploration and settlement , and by a stroke of the pen the area of her domain was doubled , to include a vast territory which French and Spanish adventure had opened to the civilized world .

		The century of these hundred years closes upon a
United States	LOCATION	which has gone step by step tjo an ever enlarging empire built up on Latin lands , with the one exception of
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		The present day is a time of new departures -- in ideas as well as in geographical expansion ; and it is fitting to have our attention called to the origin of this great hundred years ' expression of earth-hun - ger .

		The book now under review suggests such a retrospect in the words of its sub-title , -- * A Story of the Great Exploration Across the Con - tinent in 1804-06 , with a Description of the Old Trail , based upon Actual Travel over it , and of the Changes found a Century later . '

		The first chapter , in a brief yet illuminating summary , presents the causes of that ^ happy accident , ' the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and empha - sizes the part then played by

1803	DATE
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	said to his ministers : ' I know the full value of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and I have been desirous of repairing the fault of the French negotiator who abandoned it in
1763	DATE	.

		A few lines of the treaty have restored it to me , and I have scarcely recovered it when I must expect to lose it .

		But if it escapes from me it shall one day cost dearer to those who oblige me to strip myself of it , than to those to whom I wish to deliver it .

		The English have successively taken from
France Canada	LOCATION	,
Cape Breton	LOCATION	,
Newfoundland	LOCATION	,
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and the richest portions of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		They shall not have the
Mississippi	LOCATION	which they covet .

		The con - quest of
Louisiana	LOCATION	would be easy if they only took the trouble to make a descent there .

		I have not a moment to lose in putting it out of their reach .

		I know not whether they are not already there .

		It is their usual course , and if I had been in their place I would not have waited .

		I think of ceding it to the
United States	LOCATION	... They only ask of me one town in
Louisiana	LOCATION	; but I already consider the colony as entirely lost , and it appears to me that in the hands of this growing power it will be more useful to the policy and even to the commerce of
France	LOCATION	, than if I should attempt to keep it . '

		Due credit is given by Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	to our envoy ,
Robert R. Livingston	PERSON	, for taking advan - tage of this mood of
Napoleon	PERSON	, and for his bold course in exceeding his instructions , under altered conditions , and purchasing the whole of
Louisiana	LOCATION	instead of merely the island of
Orleans	LOCATION	.

		The destiny of the IJnited States was thereby determined as a world-power instead of a coastal state hugging a narrow seaboard .

		He also says truly that
Jefferson	PERSON	's part in this great transaction was largely secondary , if not acci - dental .

		But to
Jefferson	PERSON	he accords a large place when it comes to the expedition of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	-- for this was distinctively
Jeffer	PERSON	- son 's contribution to the growth of our territory , and by it he permanently secured that which had been gained by Gray 's discovery of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	in
1793	DATE	, and extended the boundaries of the
United	ORGANIZATION	StJates from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to th.e
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	.

		All that has come since , -- the great conquest of
1848	DATE	,
Alaska	LOCATION	,
Hawaii	LOCATION	,
Porto Rico	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	,
Panama	LOCATION	, -- are but the sequence of that immortal journey in 1804-06 .

		Well may the author place high the names of
Meriwether Lewis	PERSON	and
William Clark	PERSON	, and not unwisely does he give many pages to the per - sonnel of the expedition , not forgetting even the humble Indian squaw
Sacagawea	LOCATION	, the bird - wom ^ an , whose work and courage inspire this last narrator of her heroism to words of eloquent tribute .

		It is not , in truth , necessary to go as far as Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	does , when in contrasting the heroism of the battle-field with that dis - played by
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, he designates the former as ' a more or less superficial and phys - ical heroism , ' and places the latter in the same category with that ' where the noble physician , with
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's love for mankind alive within him , calmly goes into the plague-stricken region to aid dying humanity , and calls it ' a deeper and purer , a moral heroism . '

		One who knows healthy masculine humanity between the ages of twenty and thirty-five knows that no other incentive is needed for the doing of self ^ sac ^ ificing and heroic deeds than the oppor - tunity for adventure .

		Nor would such men as have expanded our knowledge of the globe nearly from pole to pole claim any different motive for their exploits .

		In giving us this modern version of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	's journey , the author has done far more than to narrate the record of the expedi - tion .

		This is not the journal of the explorers , although it is enlivened by many citations from their journals , with which Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	enlarges his own excellent record .

		But as one follows through these pages , from the mouth of the
Missouri	LOCATION	to the mouth of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and then back to the mouth of the
Missouri	LOCATION	in the ensuing year , he is made to know the whole route , not only as it was in
1804-06	DATE	, but also as it is to-day , and as it has been in all the hundred years that lie between .

		Every side - light of history , biography , geography and science has been brought to bear upon a whole century of this ` trail , ' and all the arts of the portrait-painter and of the draughtsman have been utilized to make a living picture of the actors and scenes presented .

		It is a beautiful and fascinating piece of work that has been done , and the publishers have not been unmind - ful of a suitable setting for so complete a pic - ture .

		As prefatory to the edition of the jour - nals of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	which Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	is now preparing , it will be welcome .

ADA	ORGANIZATION	THROUGH BRITISH EYES .

		* Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	, whose contributions to Canadian history have already earned him a deserved popularity on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, has now attempted an elaborate descriptive work on the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, which he entitles `
Canada	LOCATION	in the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The book deals primarily , as its title implies , with the
Canada	LOCATION	of the present day ; but in many cases Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	has found it expedient , for the better understanding of existing condi - tions and problems , to sketch , briefly the past history of the country .

		That there is room for a book of this nature goes without saying .

		As a matter of fact , there *
Canada	LOCATION	in the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
A. Bradlej	PERSON	- .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		G. 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, does not exist at present anything like a com - prehensive work on contemporary
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	states that he has himself for many years past felt the need of a good general sketch of
Canada	LOCATION	and Canadian life in readable form , and that he has been constantly asked to recom - mend such a book , but was unable to do so .

		Finally , as no one else seemed disposed to take up the tiask , he determined to make the attempt himself ; and the result we have before us .

		It must be stated at the outset , in favor of Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's book , that it is not the result of a flying visit to
Canada	LOCATION	.

		He quotes in his preface the familiar Canadian tradition of the Englishman who wroite a book on
Canada	LOCATION	, after a stay of three weeks in
Toronto	LOCATION	, which began with `
Canada	LOCATION	is a flat country . '

		Both the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	have suffered repeat ^ - edly from this kind of transatlantic visitor , and we are thankful to know that Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	is not one .

		As a matter of fact , the aiithor is peculiarly well fitted to give a graphic and intelligent pic - ture of present-day
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Over a quarter of a century ago he spent a dozen years of his life in the
United States	LOCATION	, engaged in agricultural pursuits .

		He was then , and has been since his return to
England	LOCATION	, a frequent visitor to Can - ada ; and , finally , when he definitely undertook the preparation of this work he felt it impera - tive that he should place himself in touch with the very latest conditions of Canadian life , and to that end he spent seven months of last year in various parts of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, comparing the
Canada	LOCATION	of ten , twenty , thirty years ago with the
Canada	LOCATION	of to-day , renewing old acquaint - ances and picking up new ones , getting impres - sions and opinions from everyone he met , and noting with the eye of a shrewd and friendly critic both the weaknesses and virtues of
Cana	LOCATION	- dian character .

		He confesses at once that his point of view is optimistic . '

		Happily ,
Canada	LOCATION	will justify a good deal of cheery optimism . '

		Englishmen , he says , ' do not yet fully realize how great is the leap forward in every particu - lar that
Canada	LOCATION	has made in the last five years , and how immeasurably her horizon has broad - ened . '

		The Maritime Provinces -- ISTova `
Scotia	LOCATION	,
New Brunswick	LOCATION	, and
Prince Edward Island	LOCATION	-- Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	omits entirely from his book .

		In view of the importance of this section of the Dominion from many points of view , his excuse that something had to be omitted if the rest of
Canada	LOCATION	was to be covered , even inadequately , in a single volume , seems somewhat lame .

		One might suggest a good many places where com - pression could have been exercised with advan - tage , and room thus found for a chapter or two on the Maritime Provinces , without at all increasing the bulk of the work .

		A tendency .

		in fact , toward wordiness and repetition is one of the few faults that one can find with the book .

		Having eliminated the
Maritime Provinces	ORGANIZATION	, Mir .

		Bradley adopts the convenient and graphic method of taking his readers on a personally conducted tour of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, from the moment when the transatlantic passenger gets his first and not too favorable view of the country in passing tlirough the Straits of
Belle Isle	LOCATION	, until he finally lands , safe and sound , and with a vastly clearer and more compre - hensive knowledge of
Canada	LOCATION	and its people , in the picturesque capital of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a little surprising to find one usually so well informed in Canadian history as Mr.
Brad	PERSON	- ley , repeating the exploded theory that
Cabot	PERSON	's landfall was on tihe shores of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		Even a superficial knowledge of recent Cabot literature would have made such a statement impossible .

		Historians are still at variance as to whether Cabot landed for the first time on the shoresi of Labrador or upon the coast of
Cape Breton	LOCATION	; but practically every modem investigator whose opinion counts for anything has long since discarded the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	landfall .

		Nor can one altogether excuse the statement , on page 22 , that under Champlain 's inspiration men from
Quebec	LOCATION	crossed the
Eed River	LOCATION	of the North and actually gazed upon the icy summits of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	.

		This of course refers to the younger La Verendrye ??

		, who were first among white men to make their way across the western prairies to the foot of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a far cry , however , from the beginning of the seventeenth to the middle of the eighteenth century ; and there are no grounds for sup - posing , even by a streteh of the imagination , that the La Verendryes carried out their bril - liant explorations in the West under the inspira - tion of
Champlain	LOCATION	.

		One is at a loss , too , to know what novelists are referred to on page 26 , who are described as treating the French regime in
Canada	LOCATION	with lack of historical proportion and perspective , and describing the French-Canadian noble as attired in gorgeous apparel and dining off golden plate in marble halls .

		Certainly this does not apply to Canadian novelists who have taken
New France	LOCATION	for their scene .

		Parker ,
Kirby	PERSON	, De
Gaspe	LOCATION	, and Marmette , to mention no others , have all written novels whose his - torical background belongs to the French regime , but to none of these would the criticism apply .

		While in a critical mood it may perhaps be permissible to take exception to one or two crudities of style into which the author allows himself to fall .

		M. Menier is described in one place as having bought the island of Anticosti

		THE DIAI .

		115 ' at one fell swoop ' ; Champlain is referred to , rather inadequately , as a ' fine fellow ' ; and again , the English and Dutch are said to have supplied the enemies of
Quebec	LOCATION	with arms ' now this long time . '

		However , one has no desire to be hypercritical , and these are only minor blem - ishes in a very excellent book .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	devotes his first four chapters to the province and people of
Quebec	LOCATION	; and perhaps no part of his book reveals more strikingly his keen and accurate insight .

		He shows a knowl - edge of the life and character of the French - Canadians that few English-Canadians , and still fewer Englishmen , possess .

		He gives a vivid word-picture of
Quebec	LOCATION	, its unrivalled picturesqueness , its walls , gates , ancient build - ings , the atmosphere of other times that still clings to its quaint winding streets , its life so radically different from that of any other city on this continent .

		The history , too , of the old town , so replete with dramatic interest , is not forgotten ; though for a fuller treatment of the famous siege Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	refers his readers to his earlier works , ' The Eight with
France	LOCATION	for
North America	LOCATION	' and `
Wolfe	PERSON	. '

		The relations of French-Canadians to their English-speaking fellow-countrymen are dis - cussed temperately and sanely , and throughout these chapters the author reveals himself as a warm admirer of all that is best in French - Canadian character .

		Here is an admirable contrast between the national points-of-view of the Quebecker and the Anglo-Canadian : ' The vision of the Anglo-Canadian soars over forests , mountains , and prairies .

		His patriotism has kept pace with confederation .

		The village church is nothing to him , or very rarely so ; while the soil or the water-power of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	is very much the same as the soil or water-power of
Ontario	LOCATION	, if it serve his purpose better .

		Local attachment is not wholly wanting in the man of
Ontario	LOCATION	, but it bears no comparison to the point of view of the French-Canadian , who is individu - ally as much cut off from his European antecedents as if he were a Chinaman .

		To the most illiterate Anglo-Canadian the '' old country '' of his grand - father whence he sprang are tangible facts .

		The habitant , in this sense , has no '' old country . ''

		Artificial but ineffectual methods are resorted to by faddists or politicians to persuade him that he has an interest in the doings of modern
Paris	LOCATION	and modem
France	LOCATION	.

		But only think of it !

		Recall for a moment his long isolated past .

		Consider when and how and by whom French
Canada	LOCATION	was settled , and how old
France	LOCATION	treated her .

		Remember the early crystallization of the first batches of emi - grants and the absence of any serious infiux after the seventeenth century ; then the conquest of the country by
England	LOCATION	; and finally , the French Revo - lution !

		There is absolutely no parallel between the links which bind the most representative classes in
Ontario	LOCATION	to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the utter lack of connection between
French Canada	ORGANIZATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		When an unadaptable type of English - man arrives in
Canada	LOCATION	, his attitude is often the subject of local jest ; but on those rare occasions when a native of old
France	LOCATION	, and particularly a native of
Paris	LOCATION	, descends upon the rural districts of
Quebec	LOCATION	, the mutual criticism which is aroused far transcends , I believe , anything that is ever wit - nessed among Anglo-Saxons of similar situation . '

		Moving on to
Ontario	LOCATION	, Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	gives his readers a clear and intelligible account of pres - ent-day conditions in the premier province of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, both in town and country .

		He describes , as he has already done in the case of
Montreal	LOCATION	, the industrial , intellectual , and social features of
Toronto	LOCATION	, the attractiveness of the Canadian capital , and the energy and resourcefulness that characterize the rapidly growing towns of
Western Ontario	LOCATION	.

		The Onta - rio farmer absorbs the better part of a chapter ; and both here , and later when he comes to deal with
Manitoba	LOCATION	and the
North-West	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Brad	PERSON	- ley gives the young Englishman who contem - plates emigrating to
Canada	LOCATION	and taking up farming a great deal of wholesome and much - needed advice .

		Passing on through that vast land of prom - ise .


New Ontario	LOCATION	, the author brings his readers to
Winnipeg	LOCATION	, the Gateway of the West , which bids fair to outrival all the cities of
Eastern Canada	ORGANIZATION	within a few years .

		The vital questions of Western Canadian expansion , the rapid development of wheat and mixed farming , the influx of American , British , and other settlers , and other cognate topics , Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	dis - cusses from the point of view of a shrewd and observing onlooker , one who plainly takes a warm interest in the welfare of the
West	LOCATION	.

		His views on the so-called ' American invasion ' of the Canadian North-West are interesting as those of a well-informed and clear-headed Eng - lishman who sees in the increasing emigration of experienced Western American farmers to the rich virgin lands of the North-West nothing but good to both
Canada	LOCATION	and her new settlers .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	shows a fine appreciation of the varied scenery of the country of which he treats .

		He has an eye not merely for the grandeur of
Niagara	LOCATION	, the majesty of the Eockies , the sea - like expanse of Superior , and the limitless horizon of the prairies , but as well for the pic - turesqueness of French-Canadian villages , the quiet charm of a bit of rural
Ontario	LOCATION	, and the vivid coloring of a British Columbian valley in autumn -- where the dogwood blossoms in
November	DATE	.

		Everywhere and always he notes with enthusiasm the clear , dry , bracing air of the North , which more than anything else has contributed to make Canadians healthy in body and mind .

		The book contains a large number of clear 116 THE DIALi -LSB-

		Recent Poetry .

		* One rises from a perusal of * The Divine Vision ' with a feeling of having been steeped in the very essence of poetry , of having learned the secret of the springs of song .

		The sense is long there - after haunted by soft melodies and beautiful pic - tures , by a sort of transcendental vision wherein are mingled flowers and birds and jewels , colors and odors , and elemental presences .

		Of thought in logical form there is little or nothing , and of story hardly more , in this residuum of recollec - tion ; but there is an iridescent imaginative haze in which it is pleasant to linger .

		Let us quote , by way of illustration , the opening lines of ` The Feast of Age . ' '

		The wonder of the world is o'er ; The magic from the sea is gone : There is no unimagined shore .

		No islet yet to venture on .

		The Sacred Hazels ' blooms are shed .

		The Nuts of Knowledge harvested . '

		Oh , what is worth this lore of age If Time shall never bring us back Our battle with the gods to wage Reeling along the starry track .

		Let be the tale of him whose love Was sighed between white

		It will not lift the heart above The sodden clay on which it rests .

		Love once had power the gods to bring All rapt on its wild wandering . '

		We dwindle down beneath the skies .

		The shepherd stars have shrunk within .

		The world 's great night will soon begin . '

		Will no one , ere it is too late .

		Ere fades the last memorial gleam .

		Recall for us our earlier state ?

		For nothing but so vast a dream That it would scale the steeps of air Could rouse us from so vast despair .

		• Oh , while the glory sinks within Let us not wait on earth behind .

		But follow where it flies , and win The glow again , and we may find Beyond the Gateways of the
Day Dominion	ORGANIZATION	and ancestral sway . '

		Such poetry as this -- and the examples we have quoted are '' by no means exceptional -- is a joy forever .

		It is well known that ` A. E. ' is Mr.
George Russell	PERSON	, and that he is one of the most remarkable of the men associated with the Celtic revival .

		To us , his special charm results from the fact that his inspiration is more eclectic than that of his fellow-workers .

		His poems have the peculiar Celtic magic in the fullest measure ; but they have also something of Hellenic sugges - tion , and the mysticism with which they are in - fused is of ` the brooding East ' even more than it is of the
Isle of Saints	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	was , as most of us know , a convinced and earnest opponent of the course taken by the English government in its recent dealings with
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		He held the war to be an unrighteous one , ignoring , as we think , the fundamental facts that it was begun by the
Boers	PERSON	, and that
England	LOCATION	's main object m its prosecution was to free Englishmen from the oppression of a corrupt minority intrenched in power .

		But of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's sincerity m his attitude , there can be no manner of doubt ; and his contributions in verse , made from time to time to English journals during the period of the war , have a more than ephemeral value .

		They have been collected -- some two dozen short pieces -- into a volume entitled ' For England : Poems Written during Estrangement . '

		We quote the pair of stanzas on `
Rome	LOCATION	and Another , ' be - cause it is simple and effective , and because it

		THE DIAL 117 has a more significant message for our own coun - try than for its author 's own . '

		She asked for all things , and dominion such As never man had known .

		The gods first gave ; then lightly , touch by touch , O'erthrew her seven-hilled throne . '

		Imperial Power , that hungerest for the globe .

		Restrain thy conquering feet .

		Lest the same Fates that spun thy purple robe Should weave thy winding-sheet . '

		The ` Land and Sea Pieces ' of Mr.
Arthur E. J. Legge	PERSON	portray the type of mind which is restless in the world of accepted creed and con - vention , and is ever groping to find the permanent beneath the illusory , to escape from the meaning - less distinctions of everyday life and find refuge in the eternal verities .

		This may seem a ponder - ous way of accounting for a collection of poems that are for the most part simple and unpreten - tious , and that are even at times conceived in a half-flippant spirit ; but the note which we have suggested is struck again and again .

		We hear it in the poem called `
Olivia	ORGANIZATION	's Garden , ' which deals manfully and cleanly with the theme of
Rossetti	PERSON	's * ■
Jenny	PERSON	' ; we find it in ' The Death - Mask of Leopardi . ' '

		Ah , let me conquer doubt !

		To suffer and to sorrow more than most Has been the poet 's privilege through all time , To leave the vulgar host Who follow Comus in unlovely rout , And search through that dim shadow-land without For something more sublime . '

		Again we find it in the closing lines of that fine poem , `
Raleigh	LOCATION	's Lost Voyage . ' '

		Poor world Of baffled phantoms !

		Have our deaths and births Much meaning after all ?

		Well , here at last Passes a man moulded in Life 's red fire .

		Fate weaves a chequered groundwork for such souls ; Dark , transient Evil , -- bright , eternal Good . '

		Again we find it in ` Prometheus , ' in the words dedicated to all those who follow in the footsteps of the Titan , and defy , and endure . '

		Their tombs arc marble mile-stones on the road
Nations	ORGANIZATION	have trod to freedom .

		Their names ring through tales Cherished in lonely dales And mountain homes , -- through songs the people sing Behind the plough , or with the harvest-load .

		Like stars they gleam Out of the human gloom and storm-clad past .

		And in the march of many a youthful dream They sound a trurapet-blast . '

		And still again we find it in the verses in - scribed to `
Elle et Lui	PERSON	, ' to
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, and to
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	in the poem ` Eversley , ' from which we make our final quotation . '

		Old dogmas are outworn That he taught in this little church ; and all creeds die ; And teachers pass ; and the lesson-pages are torn , And the dusty books laid by ; But , at least , this man has helped us to hear the note Of the wordless song whose wandering murmurs float From fields that the sunlight splashes with golden-brown As it plays on the shocks of corn , from woods that crown The sloping ridges , from meadow and lane and heath .

		And crowded pines , with a blush of heather beneath .

		And the stream where the fat trout lie ; -- oh , here is rest From the world , with Its fevered brain and panting breast .

		And Youth comes back with its visions and that sweet dawn Of Hope , that lighted the dew upon dream-land 's lawn .

		And set all the colors aflame in the garden-beds Where the flowers of love and glory lifted their heads .

		And we see the land we had lost , and forget the din Of a jarring age , and learn the wisdom anew .

		That tells how only the losers in life shall win And only the dreams be true . '

		We can hardly praise too highly the thought - fulness and sincerity of this book ; these are its essential qualities , albeit the author commands sufficient poetic expression for their graceful adornment .

		In part a republication , and in part new , the ' Secret Nights ' of Mr.
J. A. Nicklin	PERSON	offers us a slender but exquisite collection of verse .

		Four sonnets and something more than a dozen lyrics make up the sum total ; but each piece is care - fully wrought , and tempts us to linger over its musical cadence .

		The sonnet called ` The Poet 's Mass ' shall be our selection . '

		Before an altar of deep-jeweled blaze The poet , pale , with gracious head down-bent .

		Serves on his knees Love 's awful sacrament .

		Swinging a censer of delicious praise He draws eternity into his gaze And falters forth the god within him pent .

		Then , when his hour of worship is full - spent .

		Leaves the still shrine for wild , tumultuous ways .

		Ah , strew before him roses red and white !

		Red roses are the crimson prints of pain .

		But white for purity and for delight .

		Let tremulous music fall in silver * rain .

		And the waved torches flame into the
night	TIME	.

		And make night splendid , and the street Love 's fane . '

		Mr.
Nicklin	PERSON	's verses have a touch of decadence , and more than a hint of
Henley	LOCATION	; but they are by no means obvious imitations , and are entitled to stand upon their own merits .

		` The
Temple of Friendship	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems , ' by Mr.
Vincent Benson	PERSON	, is a work characterized by marked poetical sensibility .

		Whatever is beautiful in art , nature , and life , makes a forci - ble appeal to the writer , whose gift of expres - sion is sufficiently developed to make his verses more than agreeable to the refined intelligence .

		A few of his pieces are intimately personal ; but most of them are of bookish inspiration , revealing especially the sympathetic student of the classics .

		We quote the personal confession of ` The Fountain Head . ' '

		As I read o'er again the parable Of that fierce house where sin and sorrow slept , The giant singer of Eleusis wept His very soul Into my soul , and full Of love and yearning for so beautiful A truth , I turned to
Weimar	LOCATION	's iron bard .

		Who sang a woe Indeed , but a woe marred By higher weal , and a love dutiful .

		Then cried , '' O bring me to the fountain-head , That I may weep and dread and love as ne'er But poet can . ''

		Yet none gave answer there .

		Only methought as the slow sun sank red Upon the sea , and the wind soughed to bed , Apollo passed me with his gleaming hair . '

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is a poet of the tribe of
Alfred	LOCATION	, bringing to him that tribute which is the sin - cerest form of flattery .

		` The
Lotus Eaters	ORGANIZATION	' sug - gests the theme , and is clearly the inspiration , of ` The Island of No Death , ' while `
Moenia Mundi	ORGANIZATION	' is venturesome enough to reproduce for us the last thoughts of Lucretius in the soliloquy of his dying hour .

		` The Last Days of Theodorie the Ostrogoth , and Other Verses , ' an anonymous collection , is , like the volume mentioned just before , an Oxford 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, production .

		The stately and sombre title-poem is a fine example of reflective verse written in rhymed couplets .

		These are the prophetic closing lines : ' What though my glory fade from memory .

		And men deny my tolls the meed of praise ?

		Enough for me to know that after-days Will see the work fulflll 'd wherein I failed , Will see my people 's glory unassalled , Crowned with more lasting triumphs than were mine .

		Men 's eyes are dim ; the future gives no sign Of aught that Is to be ; we can but trust That good will vanquish evil .

		God Is just .

		It may be -- for the voice of time is dumb -- That years of toil and war are still to come .

		Of civil tumult , slavery and pain ; Yet at the last this land I loved will gain Freedom and peace , and men once more will see A glorious and united
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Many of the pieces in this volume are written in a light and pleasing vein , but the deeper note is not far off .

		The following sonnet on `
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- raltar ' is an example of the author 's work at its best : ' On Calpe 's rock the wild narcissus grows , Lives Its short life in lone humility .

		Then fades away that other blooms may be .

		And where it grew no living creature knows .

		And that stupendous rock whereon it grows Heedless of one poor flower 's mortality Stands changeless by the ever-changing sea ; Whose tide like life forever ebbs and flows .

		So let this fragile flower of verse , my friend , Live its short life unharmed .

		Its root is frail .

		Its stem made slenderly .

		Its petals pale One ruthless foot , one biting breeze would rend .

		So let It live its day , and when It dies Tell no one where my dead narcissus lies . '

		Ours , at least , shall not be the ` ruthless foot ' to rend so graceful and delicate a flower of verse as this .

		Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's new volume is called * The Lyric Bough . '

		It is a collection of miscel - laneous pieces , the greater number having aspects of nature for their theme .

		` An
Autumn Song	ORGANIZATION	' offers a favorable illustration of this quality . '

		Again the old heraldic pomp Of
Autumn	DATE	on the hills ; A scarlet pageant In the swamp ; Low lyrics from the rills And a rich attar in he air That orient morn distils . '

		Again the tapestry of haze Of amethystine dye Encincturing the horizon ways ; And from the middle sky The Iterant , reverberant call Of wild geese winging by . '

		Agaan the viols of the wind Attuned to one soft theme ; -- Here , every burden left behind , O love , would It not seem A near approach to paradise To dream and dream and dream ! '

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	is a very satisfying lyrist as a rule ; sometimes , when he seems to be reaching out for more flexible forms of expression , he is not altogether happy , but he is a practised singer , and we always find him welcome .

		Mr.
Martin Schutze	PERSON	is the author of a slender , collection which he has styled ' Crux ^ tatis , ' from the somewhat obscure sonnet which he places on his opening page .

		He sometimes has a touch that suggests
Heine	PERSON	, but his verse suffers as a rule from unmusical aggregations of voca - bles and from a failure to master the niceties of English idiom .

		His qualities , with their defects , are clearly shown in these lines from ` The
Gale	PERSON	' : ' O my beloved , can not we Amid the passionate uproar On storm-steep paths of liberty One care-free journey fare ?

		Can we not one sun 's course be free , Mid urge and surge of generous dare .

		On racing crests of life to be As billows , birds and air ?

		Can we not burst the gates of fear .

		Sweep off the bars and crumbling stare And lees of yesterday 's wisdom drear .

		And wiser-prudency ?

		Our thoughts without expedient veer , The falter in our voice no more .

		Our hearts no usurers , the sheer Storm-joy within the deep soul 's core .

		* The struggle for expression is here too obvious , the achievement too imperfect , and the faults we find exhibited in these lines are of too fre - quent occurrence , to make Mr.
Schutze	PERSON	's volume more than an experiment with some small promise of future i > erformance .

		Mr.
W. H. Venable	PERSON	writes lyrics of pedagc ^ y , ballads of
Ohio Valley	ORGANIZATION	heroism , and occasional tributes to the history of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a certain vigor , but not much pretence of poetry , about the lines which describe the Great Ordinance as ' A heart , A vital and organic part .

		Propelling by its strong pulsation The unremitting stream and flood Of wholesome inflences that give Unto the body politic The elements and virtues quick Whereby Republics live . '

		It would be hardly fair , however , to represent Mr.
Venable	PERSON	by these lines alone , and we supple - ment them with a few stanzas from ' Saga of the Oak , ' the poem which gives a title to the collec - tion . '

		Centuries do I stand here Thinking thoughts profound and drear .

		Dreaming solemn dreams sublime Of the mysteries of time . '

		Roots of mine do feed on graves ; I have eaten bones of braves , In the ground the learned gnomes Read to me their cryptic tomes . '

		Annals treasured in the air All the past to me declare , Every wind of heaven brings Tribute for me on Its wings . '

		I am weary of the years ; Overthrown are all my peers .

		Slain by steel or storm or flame , -- I would perish too -- the same . '

		Yet shall I a little space Linger still In life 's embrace Ere metempsychosing time Drag me down to Niflhelm . '

		A string of ineffectual quatrains , imitative of the Tent-Maker , yet optimistic in their strain , opens Mr.
John G. Jmy	PERSON	's ` Omar and
Fitzgerald	PERSON	, and Other Poems . '

		-LRB- This misprinting of

		THE DIAL 119 be illustrated by these stanzas from ` Two Souls ' : ' Two souls walked on a leaf-strewn way .

		Through fairest woodland scene .

		In varied aisles of gold and green Where reigns the Queen of Day .

		One saw but vale and flower and tree , -- The other , God 's serenity . '

		Two souls paused at the gates of night , As sank life 's sun to rest ; One , tearful , looked into the west .

		Till tears obscured his sight ; Beyond Death 's circling shadow bars .

		One read
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's promise in the stars . '

		A set of ` Vignettes ' comes at the close of this volume .

		We reproduce two of them , one as an illustration of the author 's taste , the other for a reason different but obvious .

		`
Joshua	PERSON	' is the subject of the first . '

		Didst thou write that fake infernal About the sun in
Gibeon	LOCATION	?

		-- The moon in vales of Ajalon ?

		If printing were in vogue , Bold and designing rogue .

		Thou wouldst have owned a yellow journal . '

		The subject of the other is ` Caesar . ' '

		Proud apex of
Rome	LOCATION	's towering pile That stood for war and strength and lust , -- Then , crashing like the Campanile At
Venice	LOCATION	, fell -- a cloud of dust ! '

		Another product of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	is the volume called ` Shapes of Clay , ' into which Mr.
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	has brought together the fugi - tive verses of many years , -- nearly four hundred pages of them altogether .

		Much of this work is the merest journalism , and had better have been left in obscurity .

		But Mr.
Bierce	PERSON	has been a considerable force in `` Western letters for many years , and his work sometimes reaches a high plane of diction and emotion .

		Even when it does not deserve such description , it often has enough of the arresting and vigorous quality to keep it alive .

		Some of the pieces fairly match
Bret Harte	PERSON	in his own peculiar manner , which state - ment we may illustrate by quoting from the story of a Yorick of the forty-niners . '

		Maybe I knowed you ; seems to me I 've seed Your face afore .

		I do n't forget a face , But names I disremember -- I 'm that breed Of owls .

		I 'm talking some'at into space An ' maybe my remarks is too derned free Seein ' yer name is unbeknown to me . '

		Ther ' was a time , I reckon , when I knowed Nigh onto every dern galoot in town .

		That was as late as
' 50	DATE	.

		Now she 's growed
Surprisin	PERSON	' !

		Yes , me an ' my pardner ,
Brown	PERSON	, Was wide acquainted .

		If ther ' was a cuss We did n't know , the cause was -- he knowed us . '

		By way of contrast to this humorous effusion , we will append the poem ` Geotheos , ' which seems to us the best piece in the collection .

		• As sweet as the look of a lover Saluting the eyes of a maid , That blossom to blue as the maid Is ablush to the glances above her , The sunshine is gilding the glade And lifting the lark out of shade . '

		Sing therefore high praises , and therefore Sing songs that are ancient as gold , Of Earth in her garments of gold ; Nor ask of their meaning , nor wherefore They charm as of yore , for behold .

		The Earth is as fair as of old . '

		Sing songs of the pride of the mountains .

		And songs of the strength of the seas .

		And the fountains that fall to the seas From the hands of the hills , and the fountains That shine in the temples of trees .

		In valleys of roses and bees . '

		Sing songs that are dreamy and tender Of slender Arabian palms , And shadows that circle the palms .

		Where caravans , veiled from the splendor .

		Are kneeling in blossoms and balms In islands of infinite calms . '

		Barbaric , O Man , was thy runing When mountains were stained as with wine By the dawning of
Time	ORGANIZATION	, and as wine Were the seas , yet its echoes are crooning , Achant in the gusty pine And the pulse of the poet 's line . '

		We could wish that the author of such lines as these had sufficient restraint to keep himself from publishing the cheap witticisms and the unar bashed vulgarities which frequently disfigure his pages .

		But we must be sparing of adverse com - ment , lest Mr.
Bierce	PERSON	apply to us his description , ` The thoughts unreal which they think they think , ' which is his neat way of characterizing the judg - ments of critics .

		A voice from
Tennessee	LOCATION	comes to us in the ` Poems ' of Mr.
Walter Malone	PERSON	, a volume into which the writer has remorselessly brought to - gether upwards of two hundred compositions , some frankly labelled as ` Juvenile , ' and all pedestrian and uninspired .

		` The critic wonders , ' he observes , -- ' The critic wonders why the lowly bards Still write and write when no one seems to read .

		When fame and fortune still refuse rewards , And when the world gives but a wreath of weed . '

		The apology urged is that ` they have done their best , ' than which even Shakespeare could do no more .

		Mr.
Malone	PERSON	's best does not seem to dif - fer greatly from his worst ; we leave the reader to decide which is represented by these stanzas on ` Dante and
Gemma	PERSON	' : ' Surrounded by the dull and commonplace ,
Dante	PERSON	and
Gemma	PERSON	lived as man and wife ; Year after year they kept the self-same pace .

		Amid the homely scenes of prosy life . '

		Seven children came to romp around their door , And give her weary hands more work to do ; Without complaint , the burden all she bore , -- She loved them and their father ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, so ! '

		-LRB-
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is devoted to ' The Classification of Flowering Plants , ' and is intended to place before English readers the results of the world 's latest research in the field of systematic botany .

		As the author , Di * .

Bendle	PERSON	, puts it in his preface , we have here ' an attempt to give the student who acquaintance with the rudiments of systematic account of the flowering Volume I. deals with the

Sept. 1	DATE	.

		with the Monocotyledons -- the lilies , the grasses , the palms , and their kin .

		The
Dicotyle	PERSON	- dons are to be presented in Volume II. , soon to appear .

		An historical introduction to the gen - eral subject makes up the first chapter , and is interesting for many reasons .

		For instance , we have here assembled , probably for the first time , a succinct and clear comparative outline of the principal schemes and systems by which the founders of modern botany have sought to ex - press their appreciation of the relationships , or at least the resemblances , found among the fiow - ering plants .

		The views of
Linne	LOCATION	, Jussieu , the De Candolles , are each and all here presented so that any reader may compare and understand them .

		Then again , it is always well to know history ; we better understand present views when we know the route by which they were attained .

		For such reasons we are inclined to regard the first chapter as one of the most valua - ble in the book .

		In the further unfolding of his subject , our author makes no claim to novelty .

		His classification of the Gymnosperms , both fos - sil and recent , follows , in the main , lines already familiar to American students .

		In discussing the
Monocotyledons	PERSON	, the arrangement given by the German scholar ,
Engler	PERSON	, in the ` Syllabus , ' is generally adhered to .

		The book will , we feel sure , meet the author 's intent , and be useful to English readers the world over .

		The work is largely , in the nature of the case , a book of names ; and our only criticism at this time affects the matter of its nomenclature .

		It is true that this is the very particular in which naturalists have been unable to agree , and yet it would seem that in matters of consistency they might all agree .

		Whatever the system of nomenclature preferred , that system should be consistent .

		Co-ordinate groups should be marked by common endings .

		In discussing the
Gymnos	PERSON	- perms , our author follows this simple rule for the names of classes ; in Monoctyledons he for - gets it .

		In naming orders he is perfectly arbi - trary in all cases .

		This is a serious defect ; con - sistency here is essential to clearness both to the expert and to the general reader .

		The book is liberally illustrated by wood-cuts , many pre - pared especially for this volume .

		The press-work is good , and typographical errors are compara - tively few .

		Southern studies It is a significant fact that at in Colonial Ittst the history of the South history .

		In this treat - ment the
Carolinas	LOCATION	have perhaps had the most conspicuous part .

		To Mr.
McCrady	PERSON	's volumes , and that of Mr.
W. Roy Smith	PERSON	on early
South Carolina	LOCATION	, must now be added Prof.
Charles Lee Raper	PERSON	's '
North Carolina	LOCATION	, a Study in English Colonial Government ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is first of all commendable because of the large - ness of view in which it has been written .

		It is without question , as the author claims , the first study from original sources of the whole period of the provincial government of
North Carolina	LOCATION	; and no small part of that which is valuable in the history of the colony will be found in its pages .

		At the same time , the work is chiefly valuable as a study of English colonial adminis - tration in the eighteenth century , -- a study the more valuable because it departs so far from the conventional treatment of the affairs and institu - tions of the American colonies .

		After a running survey of the proprietary period , which ended with the establishment of the crown government in
1729	DATE	, Professor
Raper	PERSON	settles himself to a keen analysis of the administrative , legislative , and judicial systems , as they actually worked under the rule of the five royal governors be - ginning with
Burrington	PERSON	in
1729	DATE	and ending with
Martin	ORGANIZATION	in
1775	DATE	.

		There are separate chapters on the governor 's office and functions , the consti - tution and powers of the governor 's council , the privileges of the lower legislative house and its relations with the governor and council , the sys - tem of land-tenure and land-grants , the fiscal administration of the colony , the judicial sys - tem with its multiplicity of courts , the arrange - ments for local defense , and the circumstances attending the downfall of the royal government on the eve of the Revolution .

		Particularly in - teresting is a special chapter on the conflicts be - tween the executive and the lower house , a chap - ter which no one can afford to miss who wishes to understand the earlier stages in the develop - ment of our country 's democracy .

		Professor
Raper	PERSON	's method of working is distinctly that of the scholar .

		In the production of his monograph he has made use of all the printed and manu - script sources available , so that one can feel con - fidence in his results .

		He gives a systematic bibliography of his subject , and also many refer - ences in foot-notes which should be of value to the careful reader .

		Altogether one may well express the wish that the political institutions of others of the American colonies .

		North and South , may be treated after the same fashion and by as competent a hand .

		An excellent guide-book for those Old-time haunts ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ j ^ j ^ revive their memories of men of letters .

New England	LOCATION	in Let - ters , ' published , with attractive colored photogra - phic plates , by
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
Portland	LOCATION	to
New Haven	LOCATION	the author pursues a zig-zag course , giving in a form at once compact and entertain - ing , the chief items a literary pilgrim would do well to bear in mind .

		Literary judgments , even from the best authorities , are obviously little required in such a manual , and might better have been omitted .

		Nor will the reader look for new and startling discoveries in following this well - worn road ; or if he does he will be disappointed .

		Nearest to novelty , perhaps , is the touching stoi-y -LRB- embalmed in the poet 's ' Memoirs ' -RRB- of Whit - tier 's one love affair , his unsuccessful wooing of beautiful
Cornelia Russ	PERSON	of
Hartford	LOCATION	.

		The book s trustworthiness is marred by few and unimpor - tant inaccuracies , and these are oftener errors of omission than of commission .

		Speaking of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, the author refers to the writing of ' his
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 121 two novels , ' '
Elsie Venner	PERSON	' ' and * * The Guard - ian Angel , '' ' as if they were his only stories , * A Mortal Antipathy ' receiving no mention .


Bryant	PERSON	's birthplace ,
Cummington	LOCATION	, is grouped with
Berkshire	ORGANIZATION	points of interest in such a way as to lead the uninformed to look for it in the wrong county .

		Further bewilderment may be caused by the statement that the site of the house where he was born * is not in
Cummington	LOCATION	, but about a mile away , ' when nothing more is meant than that it is not in the immediate village .

		Worcester is dismissed with scant notice , the writer appearing to be in haste to catch the train for
Springfield	LOCATION	.

		Why
Brownson	PERSON	, who was successively a Presbyterian , a Universalist , a • Unitarian , and a Roman Catholic , should be described as * a man who would have warmed the hearts of
Cromwell	PERSON	and his Ironsides , ' is not apparent , -- except that he was a man of positive though changeable opinions , and a giver and receiver of hard blows .

		Like many writers of greater fame , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has his pet phrases , one of which is * burial garth . '

		A few verbal blemishes that mar his pages are the more vexa - tious because they could so easily have been removed .


Lyman Beecher	PERSON	is called * neither a profound scholar or an exact thinker . ' '

		To gleefully relate to their mutual friends ' will give double offense to purists .

		The atirrina life If
Richard Boyle	PERSON	, first Earl of of the
Oreat Earl Cork	PERSON	, had lived three hundred of
Cork	ORGANIZATION	.

		years later , he would have pushed his fortunes in
South Africa	LOCATION	or the Klondyke , and would have been widely known as a colon - izer of new territory and a captain of industry .

		Today , although his seventh son -LRB- and four - teenth child -RRB-
Robert	PERSON	, the philosopher and the founder of the
Boyle Lectures	ORGANIZATION	, is well remem - bered , his own name is familiar to comparatively few , notwithstanding that he played a part as conspicuous in the world 's eyes as that of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	three centuries later .

		Bom of poor par - ents and early compelled to shift for himself ,
Richard Boyle	PERSON	went at twenty-two to
Ireland	LOCATION	, then virgin soil to the English , and there rose to wealth and fame by as varied and exciting and romantic a career as can be found in history .

		Bold of spirit and alert to his very finger-tips , he did indeed , to use his biographer 's somewhat novel expression * catch Dame Fortune by the forelock . '

		He died full of years and honors , in
1644	DATE	, and with him , his panegyrist assures us , * passed away the old orders , the Elizabethan age in
Munster	LOCATION	, and the old glorious days when a man would dare the impossible , confident in him - self , in
England	LOCATION	, and in his God . '

		In Miss
Doro	PERSON	- thea
Townshend	PERSON	's * Life and Letters of the
Great Earl of Cork	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is presented a full and painstaking account of this stirring life of one whom his enemies called a political adventurer , but whose achievements under hard conditions in a raw and turbulent country must command the admiration of all .

		Additional interest is given ^ to his life by the descent from him of many well - known members of the English nobility and gen - try , and also by his acquaintance with the poet
Spenser	PERSON	, who married a cousin of his ,
Elizabeth Boyle	PERSON	.

		His biographer has been fortunate in hav - ing an ample store of material to draw from in the shape of original sources .

		The
Earl	PERSON	's diary , -- to mention no other papers , -- presents a full record of his life from
1611	DATE	to his death , and fills five volumes in its printed form .

		Miss
Townshend	PERSON	's large and well-illustrated octavo of over five hundred pages preserves , along with the eulogistic accompaniments to be expected in a sympathetic biography , all that we of to-day need to know about
Richard Boyle	PERSON	, his manifold polit - ical , military , and industrial activities , his fam - ily and his associates .

Belgium	LOCATION	is generally less known than other European nations , and much information about it is here carefully collated .

		As a constitutional monarchy ,
Belgium	LOCATION	dates only from
1830	DATE	; but the territory it occupies , though not large , is of deep historic interest .

		It comprises among its cities
Antwerp	LOCATION	,
Ghent	LOCATION	,
Brussels	LOCATION	,
Louvain	LOCATION	, and the three so-called ' dead cities of Flanders ' --
Bruges	LOCATION	,
Courtrai	LOCATION	, and
Ypres	LOCATION	.

		Small as the country is , it has in its population two distinct races , the Walloons and
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	; and these speak two languages , French and Flemish .

		It is but a small contingent of the first-named race that speaks the old ' Romance ' dialect known as
Walloon	LOCATION	, and the number of German-speaking Belgians living in the border provinces is insignificant .

		Though the Wal - loons and
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	maintain their separate racial characteristics , they are held together chiefly by their religion ; and
Belgium	LOCATION	is one of the three most devoted countries of the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Bavaria	LOCATION	and Ire - land being the other two .

		It makes a respectable showing among the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	in the arts and sciences ; and it has of late years produced at least one writer of world - wide reputation ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Its manufactur - ing centres , and its coal-mining district of the Borinage , present interesting studies in economic and social conditions .

		All this , with its recently developed ambition for colonial enterprises in
Africa	LOCATION	, furnishes abundant material for an inter - esting volume , and Mr.
Boulger	PERSON	has made use of this material with happy results .

		AnewUfe The admirable series of the of
Frederick	PERSON	' Heroes of the Nations ' -LRB- Put - the Great .

		nam -RRB- contains no biography of more solid worth , and few of more absorbing interest , than Mr.
W. F. Reddaway	PERSON	's '
Fred	PERSON	- erick the Great and the Rise of
Prussia	LOCATION	. '

		The career of that remarkable character is sketched with care and an excellent sense of proportion , and with a skill that makes his striking person - ality stand out clearly .

		The strange training given him by his brutal father , whom he came to resemble in his later life , and its effect upon 122 THE DIAJL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, his character J the strange mixture in him of the rhymester , the hard-headed , unscrupulous man of action , the pitiless tyrant , and the great soldier whose victories startled the world although he brought many disasters upon his armies by his foolish decisions at critical times ; the marvellous attention to details that looked after the mean - est and the pettiest matters in the life of his people , whether nobles or peasants ; the unmiti - gated despotism that he established , which only a succession of Fredericks could have made suc - cessful , and which he would not modify although he knew that his successor was to be a fool ; these and many other aspects of the famous monarch are clearly set forth by Mr.
Reddaway	PERSON	.

		That
Frederick	PERSON	had in him neither honor nor religion , nor any fineness of spirit , seems to be the fact ; yet through him came the aggrandize - ment of
Prussia	LOCATION	that has made modern
Germany	LOCATION	possible , and although he is not the kind of hero that many writers have made him out to be , he was a great force in bringing about mod - ern conditions in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Somefamoua An interesting example of Haus - oid landmarks manizing , now going on in
Lon	LOCATION	- of
London	LOCATION	^ ^ ^ ^ furnishes the occasion for Mr.
Charles Gordon	PERSON	's book on ' Old-Time Ald - wyeh ,
Kingsway	ORGANIZATION	, and Neighborhood ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		As the culmination of projects dating from
1836	DATE	, an avenue ninety feet wide and to bear the name of
Kingsway	ORGANIZATION	, and a semi-circular street of equal width to bear the old Danish name of
Aldwych	LOCATION	, are being constructed in one of the most con - gested portions of old
London	LOCATION	, to connect High Holbom Street with the Strand .

		As the work progresses , many famous literary and historical landmarks disappear ; and Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	, who has already written of ' The Old
Bailey	PERSON	and New - gate , ' having collected all the antiquarian lore of the neighborhood , writes it up as entertain - ingly as an antiquary can reasonably be expected to do .

		He furnishes nothing especially new in what he writes of the old ; in fact , his book , after devoting four chapters to the documentary history of the improvements , taken largely from the minutes of municipal proceedings , is princi - pally made up of quotations from
Strype	LOCATION	,
Stowe	PERSON	,
Maitland	LOCATION	,
Malcolm	PERSON	,
Oldys	LOCATION	,
John Timbs	PERSON	, and oth - ers who are the commonly accepted authorities on Old
London	LOCATION	.

		The value of his work consists chiefly in his collation of descriptions and illus - trations of the portion of
London	LOCATION	in the neigh - borhood of
Lincoln Inn	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Martin	LOCATION	in the Fields ,
St. Clement Danes	ORGANIZATION	, and
St. Mary le Strand	ORGANIZATION	, in order that they may be accessible to the students of the generations to come .

		Concerning the Professor
Woodward	PERSON	, of the Uni - Aim and Method versity of
Liverpool	LOCATION	, has added ot Education .

		^ ^ j ^ jg studies dealing with the pedagogical theory of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, a new volume , * Desiderius Erasmus Concerning the Aim and Method of Education ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The ground-plan so successfully employed in the author 's previous volume on Vittirino da Feltre is followed here .

		First , we have a thirty-page sketch of the life of
Erasmus	LOCATION	; next , more than a hundred pages of careful analyses of his edu - cational doctrine , section by section ; and finally a translation of those writings of Erasmus which treat most directly of Education .

		A careful bibliography is appended .

		Treating as it does of much the same subject-matter as the earlier volume , and by the same method , there is inevi - tably a certain loss of freshness and interest in the present work .

		It is true that the author brings out clearly the essential service of Eras - mus in adapting the humanistic ideals to the sterner moral and religious conditions of North - ern
Europe	LOCATION	; his views on many points , however , are but pale reflections of the much more vital ideas of the Italian thinkers of the Quattrocento .

		Professor
Woodward	PERSON	is a careful scholar and an excellent writer .

		A book in this field has been long needed , inasmuch as the treatment of Eras - mus in the shorter histories of education has been vague and unsatisfactory in the extreme .

		An addition to the number of notable rug books of recent years is
Mary Beach Langton	PERSON	's inter - esting and useful handbook , * How to Know
Ori	PERSON	- ental Rugs ' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which puts within reach of the general reader much information usually obtainable only in rare and expensive works .

		The first chapter gives a general survey of the subject and a description of the weaving process .

		A chapter is devoted to each of the distinctive characteristics of Persian , Caucasian ,
Kurdistan	LOCATION	, Turkish , Turkonian , Indian , Chinese , and silk rugs .

		A brief description of the dis - tricts where rugs are woven will interest many rug-lovers to whom
Saraband	LOCATION	and Cashmere and
Bokhara	LOCATION	are merely technical names .

		The book shows painstaking investigation , and is clearly and concisely written .

		It is a relief not to find here the mass of confusing detail which makes many handicraft books wearisome , and the writer 's enthusiasm can not fail to interest the general reader as well as the rug collector .

		The full - page colored illustrations , from actual rugs owned in the
United States	LOCATION	, are a valuable fea - ture of the work .

		Another notable Rug book .

		The letters have been translated by Mr.

		The substance of Mr.

		Do not be overawed by any book because it bears the name of a classic , or discouraged as to your possibilities of literary appreciation , if you do not happen to like it . '

Winter	DATE	season . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		Once more the publishers have sent out their lists of books to be issued during the
fall	DATE	and
winter	DATE	season now beginning , and once more from these lists -LRB- printed complete elsewhere in the present number -RRB- we attempt a brief survey of their more striking features , indicating a few of the titles that seem to offer the promise of exceptional interest and importance .

		This bird 's - eye view is confined , as heretofore , to a few categories only ; for the most part , to the sections of history and biography , poetry and fiction , and the history and criticism of litera - ture .

		The book of the year -- when any one book may fairly be thus designated -- - is more likely to be found in the section of biography and memoirs than anywhere else .

		The coming year offers many works of this class that can not fail to prove deeply interesting , although none seems to have quite the importance of Morle/s
Gladstone	PERSON	or
Spencer	PERSON	's Autobiography -- to mention two conspicuous works of the year recently past .

		We are inclined to think that the promised ` Autobiography , Memories , and Experiences ' of Mr.
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	will turn out to be the most valuable publication of the season in this department ; certainly it will have the deepest sort of interest for American readers .

		Mr.
Con	PERSON	- way is one of the few surviving members of the group of writers and thinkers whose work embodies the finest traditions of our national development , and , although he has spent many years abroad , he has never ceased to be one of us in spirit , or to hold courageously to the older ideals of character and conduct that now seem in danger of becoming obsolete factors in our life .

		The only other work likely to vie in per - sonal interest with Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's Autobiog - raphy will be the collection of letters written by
John Euskin	PERSON	to Mr.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		Tbese we have already been permitted to read , in part , through the medium of ' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, ' and they reveal the lovable person - ality of the writer more clearly than it has ever before been shown to us .

		Other important works of biography include the ' EecoUections and Letters of General
Lee	PERSON	, ' Admiral
Schley	PERSON	's Torty-Five Years under the Flag . '

		` An Irish - man 's Stoiy , ' by Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	, the ` Life and Letters of
Mandell Creighton	PERSON	, ' a new mem - oir of
Aubrey de Vere	ORGANIZATION	, and
Alfred Vizetelly	PERSON	's life of Zola .

		A series of ' French Men of Let - ters , ' which we trust may have better luck thftn 156 THE DIAIi -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the one started some years ago , will begin most auspiciously with a volume on Balzac by
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	.

		The approaching completion of three full cen - turies of
England	LOCATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	seems to be stimulating the production of a number of American histories on a large scale .

		Two new works of this character appear in our present list .

		One is by Dr.
Edward Channing	PERSON	, in an unspecified number of volumes , and the other , in ten volumes , is by Messrs.
W. E. Chancellor	PERSON	and
F. W. Hewes	PERSON	.

		Both of these works should prove important additions to our apparatus for the furtherance of historical information .

		In this connection we should also mention the extraordinary recent activity , which shows no signs of abatement , in the reprinting , under careful editorial supervision , of diocumentary matter relating to our early history .

		Among the more ambitious new enterprises of this sort we may call attention to the promised editions of
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	, of Lahontan 's ' New Voyages , ' of
Gass	PERSON	's ' Journal , ' and of the ' Early Western Travels ' series .

		Of history other than
Ameri	PERSON	- can , we find promised fewer important works than nsual , and none that deserves to be singled out for special mention .

		The section of literary history and criticism offers many items of interest , although none of first-rate importance .

		We note with pleasure the volumes of essays announced by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, Mr.
H. W. Boynton	PERSON	, and Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	.

		The essay in this country would be in a bad way were it not for ' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, ' and without the encouragement of that maga - zine these three volumes , in particular , might never have been written .

		Other volumes of essays are Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's ' Recreations of an Anthologist , ' ' Literary Leaders of Amer - ica ' by Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	, ' Lectures and Essays ' by the late
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	, and ^ Rou - tine and ideals ' by Mr.
LeBaron R. Briggs	PERSON	.

		Among works having a greater unity of content we note ' The Italian Poets since
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Dr.
William Everett	PERSON	; ` The Temper of the Seven - teenth Century in English Literature , ' by Pro- fessor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	; ' The Principles and Progress of English Poetry , ' by Messrs.
C. M. Gayley	PERSON	and
C. C. Young	ORGANIZATION	; * Lectures on Greek Literature , ' by Mr.
S. H. Butcher	PERSON	; and ' Rus - sian Literature , ' by Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	.

		The * Wampum Library of American Literature , ' edited by Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, is a new enter - prise of which three volumes are now ready .

		Each of the volumes has a special editor , and comprises representative examples of some par - ticular literary genre , such as society verse , the short story , and literary criticism .

		This last topic reminds us to say that the third and final volume of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's ' History of Criti - cism ' is about ready to appear .

		Novels in the usual numbers are scheduled for early publication .

		Among the most promis - ing titles are the following : ' The Last Hope , ' by the late Henry
Seton Merriman	PERSON	; ' The Un - dercurrent , ' by Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	; ' The Golden Bowl , ' by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; ' A Ladder of Swords , ' by Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; '

Joseph A. Altsheler	PERSON	; ' The Seeker , ' by Mr.

		PUBLISHE R AN D PUBLIC .

		Probably most people think of the publishing business as invested with a kind of dignity which sets it a little apart from other trades .

		Pub - lishers ' offices are notoriously haunted by college boys anxious to be admitted to a calling of semi - literary character which yet promises a compe - tency .

		They dream happily of bearing a torch in one hand and a bag of the ready in the other .

		There is indeed an opportunity in publishing , an
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 aspect of it , which can not be defined in business terms .

		Yet it is only an aspect .

		Popular tradi - tion to the contrary , it is not more natural for a publisher to be a disinterested patron of the lit - ei'ary art than for him to be a grindinsf commer - cial person .

		Undoubtedly most publishers desire to put forth some good literature ; none who have to do with new books can even attempt to pub - lish nothing but good literature .

		Of course ` the publisher ' does not mean what it onc `` meant .

		The paternal publisher has taken his place with the Grub Street bookseller among relics of the past .

		A modern publishing house does its work by modern business methods .

		It has its head ; but the detail goes to separate departments , manned by specially trained crews .

		Its left hand does not always know what its right hand is doing , -- a fact which occa - sionally leads to complications between business motives and methods and others .

		Delicate adjust - ments are often necessary between editorial and business offices .

		But the general policy will be much like that which governs other commercial enterprises : to turn out as good an article as possible , and to dispose of it at as good a price as possible .

		As a rule , the publisher is doubt - less sincere in desiring to put forth what is , according to some reasonable standard , really worth publishing .

		The nicer problems of the trade turn upon the question as to how such a standard shall be determined and maintained .

		There are four classes of books ordinarily found on the lists of the modem publisher of the best type : -LRB- 1 -RRB- useful books , whether new or reprinted , which make no claim to the pos - session of literary quality ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- reprints of work which time has determined to be the product of literary art ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- new books which make some claim to literary quality , but for the publication of which there are strong practical reasons , such as timeliness , fitness for a special audience , and so on ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- new books which can hardly be expected to do more than ` pay expenses , ' but which are published for their literary merit .

		The last-named class is necessarily small ; the fact of its existence is a credit to the publisher .

		The first two classes suggest no serious problems .

		It is in connection with the third class that a more delicate question arises .

		At this point the publisher ceases to be the purveyor of a com - modity the value of which is determinable .

		Many books belong , as we have seen , to this class .

		Like shoes or soap , they are articles which the pub - lic specifically needs , and upon which it sets a specific value .

		With such books , when official analysis has proved them fit for their purpose , the publisher can afford to approach his public .

		If his services were to end there , they would be considerable , and calculable .

		The uncertainties of the trade inhere in its obligation , or its fatal - ity , of dealing with certain books which possess at least an hypothetical status as works of art .

		It appears to be a perfectly tenable position , though perhaps not a lofty one , that a work of art , having been put upon the market , becomes a purely commercial article , and must take its chances with other commercial articles .

		The dealer in works of art is , let us say ^ Avithout spe - cial obligations to the public .

		He exhibits proper objects for sale , and charges such prices for them as are commonly set upon such objects .

		Mis - takes may occur , but it is his main purpose to offer only articles which are worth buying .

		The standard will be somewhat roughly estimated ; refinements of discrimination in such matters must be left to the connoisseur and the critic .

		For the rest , the publishing-house has a right to put its best foot forward in advancing the sale of its own waxes ; it can not be expected to be colorlessly judicial in expressing its good opinion of them .

		The persons or committees by whose advice a given book has been accepted for publi - cation may express themselves in private with a good deal of resei ` vation as to its absolute liter - ary merit .

		Public utterances of opinion rarely come direct from them .

		In a general way , they furnish material for the functionaries whose spe - cial business it is to advertise , directly or indi - rectly , the books of the house .

		Such reverbera - tions of editorial judgment can hardly retain much critical quality .

		The estimate of the given book which eventually goes forth as the opinion of the house may be , as a gentleman well acquainted with publishing said recently in private conversa - tion , ` an oj ^ liion of an opinion of an opinion . '

		The final version is naturally optimistic .

		If a book has been found good enough for the firm to publish , it is merely human for individuals in the employ of the firm to take for granted that it is a very good book indeed .

		They may know little or nothing of the grounds upon which it was accepted .

		These grounds may have been , in the main , other than literary , even when the book seems to fall within a literary category .

		For example : Suppose a novel written about a young Mormon whose career is made difficult , and interesting , by complications arising from his birth through polygamy .

		The publishers might accept it for some such reasons as these : -LRB- 1 -RRB- It is timely , because the question of polygamy has just come before the nation , perhaps for the last time ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- there is nothing of this kind at present in the market ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the subject is treated so adriotly that the book ought to reach a large special audi - ence of liberal Mormons as well as the general audience of citizens who have just been excited against Mormonism ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- it is written by So-and - so , whose other novels have had such-and-such a sale ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- it is creditable in point of form , with at least as good a chance of surviving the year as the average novel .

		It seems , indeed , to have some pretensions to literary merit .

		As soon as the book is accepted , it becomes a part of this firm 's stock in trade .

		It is advance - noticed and put through the press with a solicitude lively in proportion to the expectations of its sales .

		It grows to be an article of faith with the house , so that before it is fairly upon the market it may be figuring in advertisements as the liter - ary feat of the year , decade , or century .

		There is no moral issue here .

		Modern methods of adver - tising do not prescribe , or permit , delicacy or accuracy of expression .

		It is the publisher 's affair , if he chooses to stultify himself over his signature .

		So far as his utterance of opinion is 158 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, restricted to advertising space , it need not be challenged , either as to substance or as to form , except on grounds of taste .

		It is because the coarse method pays that , as Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	says , publishers ` continue to extol the often secret chai-ms of their kept authors with an enthusiasm almost indelicate . '

		But the publisher 's opinion fails to confine itself to advertising space ; and it is at this point that his practice lays itself open to excep - tion on other grounds than those of taste .

		As a dealer in works of art , he has , we have liberally a , dmitted , no special obligations toward the pub - lic -- unless , we may add , it be that he should be scrupulous to the utmost in fathering his positive recommendations .

		For the existence of the ` reading-notice ' or ` literary note ' as now employed by the publisher , no adequate apology has as yet been offered .

		These notes are pre - pared in the publisher 's offices by specially detailed persons .

		They are put up in convenient form for direct insertion in the newspaper columns .

		There is nothing in them to suggest to the uninitiated that they are not the work of the editorial staff .

		Indeed , not a little ingenu - ity is expended upon giving them a casual flavor ; and it is evident that their value for advertising purposes depends upon the inconspicuousness , to put it mildly , of their origin .

		The specific object in view is to call attention to a particular book , by a particular author , issued by a particular pub - lishing-house .

		One or two of the parties in the enterprise commonly go unmentioned ; this sug - gests an editorial indifference to the mere con - venience of the publisher which is effective in producing the desired illusion .

		Reading-notices are nominally of two kinds : those which give information , and those which express opinion .

		In truth , they shade impercepti - bly into each other .

		The information notice in its best form gives statements of fact which may reasonably be expected to add to one 's legitimate knowledge of an author or a book .

		One may find something dubious in the apparition of any para - graph of unpaid-for advertising made to look like a product of editorial industry or curiosity .

		But important news-items directly concern the public , and if the publisher is in a position to get such facts he is right to pass them on to the newspaper ; he may even act as assistant editor as far as to word the items in question .

		They should possess some intrinsic importance .

		Too often they are statements of trivial fact framed for the sake of keeping the name of a man or a book before the public eye .

		` The other day , ' says Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, ' I read this announcement : `` The memoir of Dr.
Berry	PERSON	, of
Wolverhampton	LOCATION	, will bear the simple title , Life of the Rev.
C. A. Berry	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	'' Heavens !

		what other title could it bear ? '

		Such a note has comparative ingenu - ousness , at least .

		I have been assured by a per - son of experience that the more delicate successes in the art of reading-notice composition are due to skill in giving a statement of fact the effect of a criticism .

		Here we approach what is evidently a ques - tion of elementary ethics rather than of elemen - tai-y taste .

		Let us strain a point , and admit that I for the statement of facts publisher and editor have a practical right to exchange good offices , -- the publisher getting valuable advertising for nothing , the editor getting his columns filled for nothing , and the reader getting whatever he can for a consideration .

		Is it possible to extend our complaisance to expressions of critical opinion , the source of which is left , to say the least , equiv - ocal ?

		Publishers do not hesitate to admit that they set more value on the reading-notice than on regular advertising ; the reasons for which fact are matters for consideration , but hardly for surmise .

		Probably there is no occasion for pro- test .

		We can only recognize the fact with regret that no trade , whatever its traditional associa - tions and ideals , can now get on comfortably without some little trick warranted to extract that last indispensable drop of profit from a public which is , on the whole , well content to pay tribute whenever a creditable degree of skill is shown in the levy .

		HERBERT SPENCER ON DREAMS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Among the many personal reminiscences lead - ing the author into speculative inquiry , which ren - der
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's ' Autobiography ' so attract - ive to thoughtful readers , occurs this sentence in connection with the writer 's occasional use of opium to induce sleep : -- ` In ordinary dreams , thoughts which seem valuable or witty , turn out on awaking to be nonsensical or inane ; but in morphia dreams there sometimes arise thoughts which would not discredit the waking state . '

		He then relates -LRB- vol .

		2 , pp. 205-6 -RRB- a dream of the lat - ter sort , which without being brilliantly witty is far more coherent than most unassisted dreams .

		Yet I think it may be capable of demonstration that the ' pipe dream ' is , as a rule , far more wildly extravagant and absurdly nonsensical than the natural dream .

		At any rate , I venture to believe I can match the synthetic philosopher 's morphia dream with a recent one of my own , experienced under natural conditions ; but of course I can not make a perfectly impartial com - parison of the two .

		In my dream a college pro- fessor was examining in Roman history a stu - dent who persisted in mispronouncing proper names , as , -- Rom-w-lus , Hann-i-bal , Calig-u-la -LRB- ac - cent always on the penult -RRB- .

		At last the professor lost patience . '

		Young man , ' said he severely , ' unless you take care you will Ci-ce-ro -LSB- see zero -RSB- as the result of this examination . '

		I should add that the student 's blunders did not remain so clear in my memory , on awaking , as the professor 's punning admonition ; but that the unhappy youth had sinned against the rules of quantity I was left in no doubt .

		Thus I had to reconstruct the first part of my dream a very little ; otherwise I have related it as it occurred .

		Perhaps some of your readers can give similar or better instances of dreams wherein the god of sleep has not made such fools of his devotees as it must be confessed , to our humiliation , he too often does .

		\ Zola , J ^ ovel , ist axd Eeformer .

		* The life of Zola by Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	may natu - rally be regarded as the official English biogra - phy of the remarkable man , half Italian , half French , who won the attention of his epoch and finally forced criticism to take him as seriously as he took himself .

		It was the
Vize	PERSON	- telly publishing house that brought out Zola in English translation ; and the younger
Vize	PERSON	- telly , the present biographer , was the novel - ist 's trusted friend .

		He speaks with undoubted authority regarding the facts of Zola 's career , and has obviously at his command far more material than he has cared to use .

		The book he has produced is in part satisfying , and in part not .

		In a clear and interesting way , the main facts of Zola 's life are told ; from the pages before him one can gain a perfectly definite idea of Zola the man .

		The book does not pretend to literary criticism , save in so far as criticism is often needed to explain details of the man ` ci life ; for Zola , of course , was essen - tially a writer , and his life-blood is in his books .

		There is , then , much explanation of general and special purposes of Zola 's work , and the explanation is offered with candid enthusiasm .

		On the other hand , the book fails of being an adequate biography , partly because the writer is rather sparing of the minor per - sonal details we have come to regard as our right in biography , partly ` because he has a thesis to prove -- the essential morality of Zola and the failure of the English public to appre - ciate that morality , -- and partly because he has not himself the artist 's power of present - ing his subject with due sense of proportion and of values .

		But over-emphasis reacts rather upon the writer than upon his subject : though one objects to the method , he must acknowl - edge that the writer has made his point .

		So if a certain didacticism leads Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	to drive home with undue energy the fact that Zola was a most conscientious worker and a man of absolute devotion to his literary ideals , the reader after all is left with the correct notion in his mind ; and this is no small matter .

		Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	has no other charm of style than that of fluent sincerity , and he is handicapped by the fact that he holds a brief for his fatiier 's publishing-house , which took up Zola at a time when to publish Zola meant , as it happened , fine and imprisonment .

		But with all his draw - backs , the biographer has produced a volume which tempts one to the paradox that if the *

		book is not definitive , it nevertheless makes a definitive book unnecessary .

		We have before us , then , the life of a man who believed in the gospel of work , and who , having found out what he wanted to do , did the thing relentlessly .

		The Italian strain in
Zola	LOCATION	explains a great deal , -- the man 's insight , his large conceptions , his strong feelings , his tenacity .

		His career was one involving much hardship , the bitterness of neglect , the difficult search for the right medium of utterance , the antagonism of those who might have been his intellectual helpers , and , above all , the unyield - ing pursuit of the ideal .

		It was a career that closed in a moral triumph , a life that pre - eminently deserves study .

		To begin at the beginning , it is no wonder that Zola should have believed in heredity , since he saw it at work in his own nature .

		The father ,
Francesco	PERSON	-LRB- afterwards Francois -RRB- Zola , was a Venetian who came to
France	LOCATION	about
1830	DATE	.

		He was a military engineer , full of great projects for which he ceaselessly sought a hearing .

		If but few of his larger schemes came to maturity , it was doubtless because he was in advance of his time .

		Projects for the docks at
Marseilles	LOCATION	, for the fortification of
Paris	LOCATION	, were not accepted ; but Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	makes it fairly clear that the elder Zola 's ideas have been wholly justified by time , while the plans that were used instead have proved inade - quate .

		A project that ultimately succeeded was the * Zola canal , ' which supplies
Aix	LOCATION	with water .

		Intellectual capacity and untiring apti - tude for work were the father 's chief bequest to his son -LRB- bom in
1840	DATE	-RRB- , for premature death left a family provided with but scant resources .

		The mother , -- of the small tradesman cIeiss , one generation away from the sturdy peas - antry , -- so : ight to give a fitting education to her son , fatherless at the age of seven ; while at the same time she did her best to protect her interests in the yet unfulfilled canal scheme .

		Unjust treatment was accorded her , and a life of struggle followed her failure to establish her claims .

		Zola 's earliest school-days were days of truancy ; but from the bo/s twelfth year , the college period in
Aix	LOCATION	reads like a Sunday-school story .

		All the important constituents are there : the widow 's son , industrious and excel - lent above his classmates , winning prize after prize in an imposing series , showing ability in all directions , and being * guided by one sim - ple , self-imposed rule , a rule which he carried into his after-life , and which largely proved the making of him .

		He did not eschew play and other recreations , he did not spend inter - minable hours in poring over books , there was nothing '' goody-goody '' about him ; but he 160 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, invariably learnt his lessons , prepared his exercises , before he went to play . '

		More sur - prising than this is the choice at seventeen of a scientific a -RRB- urse rather than a literary one , although the boy was now a maker of verse , and under the spell of Victor Hugo and of de Musset ; and more surprising still is the fact that in
Paris	LOCATION	, whither his mother had removed in the vain hope of bettering the family for - tunes , the former prize-winner , now on a scholarship at the Lycee of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, remained among the mediocre , and finally failed to win his degree .

		He was now twenty , discredited , and penniless ; and after trying his hand at a clerkship in the customs at two francs a day , he went back to his literary attempts , mostly verse , and began a Grub-street existence .

		His mother had no longer enough income for two to live upon , and Zola lived alone , often in the winter , ` Fireless , shivering in bed , with every garment he possesses piled over his legs , and his fingers red with the cold while he writes his verses with the stump of a jtcncil ... His great desire when he awakes of a morning is to procure that day , by hook or crook , the princely sum of three sous in order that he may buy a candle for his next evening 's work .

		At times he is in despair : he is forced to commit his lines to memory during the long
winter	DATE
night	TIME	, for lack of the candle which would have enabled him to confide them to paper .

		... It was then , as he afterward told
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, that he lived for days together on a little bread , which , in Provencal fashion , he dipped in oil ; that he set himself to catch sparrows from his window , roasting them on a curtain rod ; that he '' played the Arab , '' remaining indoors for a week at a time , draped in a coverlet , because he had no garments to wear ... He often used to say in after-life that the only coat he possessed in that year of misery ended by fading from black to a rusty green .

		Thus , when he went hither and thither soliciting employment , he was very badly received . ''

		I gathered that people thought me too shabby .

		I was told , too , that my handwriting was very bad ; briefly , I was good for nothing ... Good for nothing -- that was the answer to my en - deavours ; good for nothing -- unless it were to suffer , to sob , to weep over my youth and my heart .

		... I had grown up dreaming of glory and fortune , I awoke to find myself stranded in the mire . '' '

		A turn of fortune in 186r3 gave Zola a small clerkship , at a hundred francs monthly , in the publishing-house of
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	; and he felt that he was saved .

		He now managed to get some of his writing into the newspapers ; and in
1864	DATE	a volume of short stories met with acceptance , not by
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, but by another house .

		The first real turn of affairs had now come ; here are Zola 's words : ' The battle has been short , and I am astonished that I have i.ot suffered more .

		I am now on the threshold : the plain is vast , and I may break my neck crossing it ; but no matter , -- as it only remains for me to march onward , I will march . '

		To finish his first novel , ' La Confession de
Claude	PERSON	, ' was the next thing to do ; and inciden - tally he kept up a steady fire of newspaper criticism , earning perhaps two hundred francs a month by his pen .

		In
1865	DATE	'
Claude	PERSON	' ap - peared , and Zola left
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	's to devote himself entirely to writing .

		From now , until the days of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	case , the story is mainly one of intellectual development and slowly improving worldly condition .

		It was not by any means all plain sailing : there were plays that were not accepted , ventures in art criticism arousing great partisan feeling , occasional serious diminutions in income ; the earlier stories , though published , had not won their way ; '
Therese Kaquin	PERSON	' -LRB-
1867	DATE	-RRB- was the first real success .

		Two years later ,
Zola	PERSON	entered into a con - tract to begin a series of novels dealing with the history of a whole family .

		In large measure , this ' Rougon-Macquart ' series was liis life - work ; and it is highly characteristic of Zola that he completely finished the project , even though its final form included nearly twice as much as the original outline indicated .

		But the publisher 's failure meant financial distress to the author , and postponement of the great scheme .

		Friends were made , and also ene - mies , -- for Zola was outspoken in his literary criticism ; and gradually the man made himself a place in the literary life of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		To the publisher
Charpentier	PERSON	,
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	, in speaking one evening of the young writers of the day , said : ' There is one among them who is very unlucky , and who is different from most of the others .

		You should admit him among your authors , my dear
Charpentier	PERSON	.

		If I am not vastly mistaken , he possesses a touch of genius .

		His name is
Emile Zola	PERSON	.

		Have you ever heard of him ? '

		This little word of com - mendation turned out to be Zola 's opportunity .

		Charpentier became his publisher , and the worldly battle was won at last .

		Zola was gradually coming to an understanding of the scope of sucli a series as that of the '
Rougon	PERSON	- Macquarts , ' but in a special sense he perhaps hardly came into his own field until be wrote '' L'Assommoir . '

		This forced the issue .

		Tlie vogue of the book , enormous for those days when a groat sale meant actually interested readers , made it impossible to ignore the fact that the man had ' arrived . '

		Far from avoid - ing controversy , Zola invited it , -- it made the vogue of his books greater , and his doctrine emerged into public attention .

		From this time forward , he had the centre of the stage .

		He finished at last his ` Rougon ' series , and then projected new groups of novels , a didactic purpose becoming more and more evident as the years went on , until finally some of his work is but the form of fiction in the service
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 of a thesis .

		To discuss Zola 's life during this period of his greatest success is to discuss his literary output , work by work ; and this is out of the question here .

		One comes now to
Zola	ORGANIZATION	's share in the
Drey	PERSON	- fus case .

		Mr ,
Vizetelly	ORGANIZATION	's account of this is full and adequate , presenting the facts fairly , it would seem , and arranging the material clearly .

		Zola 's participation in the case was wholly impersonal : that is , he had no acquaintance with the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	family , but arrived at his con - clusions from a sober study of the testimony that was accessible to him .

		Before he wrote the famous open letter to the President of the Eepublic , he had published in '
Figaro	PERSON	' a series of articles , temperately asking for a full inquiry .

		The clamor that ensued frightened the newspaper into stopping the articles .

		Zola then found a means of expression in pam - phlets ; and on becoming convinced finally that only some violent method could secure revision , he hit upon the plan of addressing a letter to President
Faure	PERSON	, couching it in such words that for the honor of the nation the writer would have to be brought to trial and suffer the penalty of libel unless he could prove his charges .

		The matter is too recent to need recapitulation here ; one may more fittingly compliment Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	on his careful pres - entation of a rather intricate subject .

		That his explanation of Zola 's attitude is correct admits of no doubt .

		The man was sincere and self - sacrificing , and events have shown that he was right .

		i ^ ot the least interesting chapter in the vol - ume is the one that tells in detail the story of the English publication of Zola .

		Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	is speaking literally pro domo sua , and wins our sympathy , even if not our complete appro - bation .

		Here , however , and in the pages tell - ing of a critical moral episode of Zola 's life , Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	protests too much , and not always with good taste ; it would have been bet - ter to state the facts quietly and dispense with argument .

		In the light of the full knowledge of Zola 's life that thlt book gives , one gathers up anew his impressions of the man and the writer .

		One does not nowadays repeat
Tennyson	PERSON	's word , ' the trough of Zolaism , ' as a fair criti - cism ; the man and his work are too significant to be dismissed with a contemptuous label .

		And yet , granting to the uttermost the moral purpose the author had in dealing with the horrors and uglinesses of life , -- granting , as one easily may , that Zola w ^ rote nothing for the sake of lubricity , and granting the right of literature to treat whatever is human , -- the serious reader of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	is likely to ask him - self .

		What is the good of most of this ?

		The | portrayal of vice rarely proves a deterrent : many of Zola 's books undoubtedly sold simply because they seemed indecent ; and one may doubt their disclipinary effect upon the pur - chasers .

		Those readers , on the other hand , who could apprehend the moral purpose under the repulsiveness , were in the main in no need of the lesson as such .

		So the question comes back , as always , to this : Has the work been done with the artistic control that creates the thing we call beauty ?

		Much , perhaps most , of Zola 's work will not stand such a test .

		One wonders , after all , how much , from a literary point of view ,
Zola	PERSON	's irdefatigableness was futile : there are many dull and many hateful pages to answer for in the novels ; nor is it over-likely that the novels will last .

		But it was due to his self-discipline in holding to the purpose of his novels , that Zola rose to his opportunity and rendered
France	LOCATION	the greatest of services , accusing French militarism of its crime .

		It ; may well be that this man of letters will occupy a higher place in the history of
France	LOCATION	than in her literature .

		162 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, force .

		In this volume the distribution has been made with good judgment , but one occasionally receives the impression that the writers have followed the programme too rigorously .

		Many things given their special setting in Professor
Viollet	PERSON	's invaluable chapter on ' French Law in the Age of the Revolution ' should be touched in the chapters on the Constituent , the Legis - lative Assembly , and .

		the Convention ; other - wise the importance of their work will be mis - conceived .

		Much the same may be said of financial affairs , described in a separate chapter by Mr.
Henry Higgs	PERSON	.

		The ' General War , ' the ' Naval War , ' and foreign affairs prior to the
1795	DATE	treaties , are also , and necessarily , man - aged in special chapters , for each of these topics possesses a peculiar center of interest and its own line of development .

		At the same time the meddlesome policy of other states and their threats of war profoundly affected the course of the Revolution , and should be explained adequately in the general narrative even at the cost of some repetition .

		Mr.
Moreton Mac	PERSON	- donald , who writes on the Legislative and the Convention , should have conceded more to the menace on the frontier in his analysis of the origin of Revolutionary violence .

		It is of more doubtful wisdom to divide , as is done here , the general narrative , -- that is , in the main , the political history of the Revolu - tion , -- among four writers ; for there is danger of a shifting of attitude which may confuse the reader .

		Of course such a division is explicable if it is suggested by the special researches of the writers themselves .

		MM .

		Lavisse and
Rambaud	ORGANIZATION	, in the eighth volume of their '
Histoire Generale	PERSON	, ' avoided the danger by assigning the whole to Professor Aulard , already distinguished for an unrivalled knowl - edge of the political history of the Revolution .

		In the present case , Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	's work on the later Assemblies is noticeably different in tone from Professor
Montague	PERSON	's description of the Constituent ; and the difference is not alto - gether accounted for by the fact that the sub - ject becomes more repellent as the history of the Legislative and of the Convention proceeds .

		There is no such difference of tone or attitude between Mr.
Fortescue	PERSON	's chapter on the Direc - tory and Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's ` Brumaire . '

		Among the noteworthy chapters of the volume are Professor Richard Lodge 's ' European Powers and the
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	' and the ' Extinction of
Poland	LOCATION	. '

		In the first he con - siders incidentally the earlier phases of
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	's foreign policy described by Mr.
Oscar Browning	PERSON	in a special chapter .

		Ilis estimate of
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	's influence is less emphatically eulogistic than Mr.
Browning	PERSON	's ; indeed , he seems to feel that the Emperor
Leopold	PERSON	was the master diplo - matist of
1790	DATE	and
1791	DATE	.

		Equally noteworthy are Dr.
J. H. Rose	PERSON	's three chapters on the foreign war after
General Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	becomes the principal figure .

		Although this is largely the same ground which he covered in his recent biography of
Napoleon I.	PERSON	, the new account is in no sense a repetition of the other .

		But for an occasional turn of phrase or identity of con - ception , it would be difficult to recognize the relationship of the two .

		No part of the work succeeds better in giving just the facts necessary for an exact understand - ing of the matters in hand than Professor
Montague	PERSON	's chapters on the Old Regime and the period of the Constituent .

		They show every - Avhere a careful consideration of the results of recent researches , -- those , for example , upon the much-debated question of the amount of land held by the peasants .

		The facts are not poured out in confusing masses , but their nature is luminously characterized in a para - graph or two , each word of which is almost a summary .

		Although the amount of attention granted to the Old Regime is questionable , when it is remembered that another volume of the series is to treat the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, these two chapters could ill be spared .

		In some respects they are superior to those on the Con - stituent .

		It is instructive to see in detail into what an impasse the government had blundered by
1788	DATE	.

		Strong statesmanship was needed in order that the King might recover that leader - ship in the nation 's affairs which so many of his ancestors had held .

		A ^ business man 's administration , ' such as Necker could give , was not the remedy .

		Many of Professor
Montague	PERSON	's characteriza - tions of men or of assemblies are remarkably suggestive .

		After a few words on Mounier ,
Malouet	PERSON	, and Sieyes , he introduces Mirabeau in this fashion : ` But these men were presently overshadowed by one who had no recommenda - tions save genius and courage , whose reputa - tion was not far removed from infamy , and who , though it was impossible to detpise or dif - ficult to hate him , was deeply dis , * , rusted by almost all his colleagues . '

		Perhaps the ma - chinery of such a sentence glittei-s too much , but it would be hard to construct anything better embodying the situation of Mirabeau at the opening of the States General .

		It is followed by a sketch , two or three pages long , which brings the man and his aims before the reader , and in which there is not a stroke or a touch that seems superfluous .

		Equally satisfactory is this lucid summary of the function of the States General , which Professor
Montague	PERSON	has just been comparing with the English parlia - ment : ' What had been true at first of all mediaeval parliaments remained true of the States General to the end .

		The deputies remained agents in relation to their electors .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 163 I petitioners in relation to the
King	LOCATION	, ' etc. .

		Of the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	he - acutely remarks , * It contained many excellent members of commit - tee , but very few statesmen , and to these it rarely listened .

		No wonder , therefore , that it should have made many good laws but have failed entirely to govern . '

		In these chapters there are few defects to be noted .

		One would hardly suspect , however , from Professor
Montague	PERSON	's description of the decrees of
August 4	DATE	, that they constituted rather a programme of reform than a comprehensive piece of legislation .

		It is only in Professor VioUet 's chapter that the matter is adequately explained .

		Furthermore , Professor
Montague	PERSON	does not make clear the relation between the controversy over a second chamber and that upon the royal vote .

		He gives the impression also that the ' suspensive ' veto was a weak form of veto , whereas it might hold back a project of law from three to six years .

		Largely moved by the necessity of compressing his descriptions of events , he has not furnished a clear account of the origin of
October 5	DATE	-- 6 .

		He has also fallen into the error , corrected by
Viollet	PERSON	on a later page , of saying that the Constituent abol - ished slavery in the colonies .

		This was done by the Convention .

		The middle period of the Revolution is not described by Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	in so satisfying a manner .

		The real difficulty is that he has no sympathy with the
France	LOCATION	of those fatal years .

		Before the conclusion of his final chapter on the Constituent , the note of disappointment in Professor
Montague	PERSON	's writing had ominously increased , but his sympathy did not fail .

		One turns the page and feels an atmosphere of hostile criticism , full of condemnation , some - times of contempt .

		Professor
Montague	PERSON	, in more than a page of detail given to the machin - ery for the election of deputies , does not hint at anything sinister about this machinery ; but Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	discovers that its complication was ` wanton and deliberate , ' -- ` all a part of the Jacobin plan . '

		He continues : ' This over - elal -RRB- oration of the electoral arrangements kept all busy men , -- in other words , all respectable men , -- from the ballot , and handed it over to idlers and vagabonds . '

		It is the tone of this statem ^ ent , rather than its inconsistency with the fact that only tax-payers or ' active citi - zens ' could vote , which is objectionable .

		The whole passage is a developed charge that the Jacobins used every device known in eighteenth - century English electioneering practice , and others less brutal .

		The same unsympathetic attitude controls the brief characterizations of members of the
Legislative Assembly	ORGANIZATION	and of the Convention .

		Brissot , for example , is the ' son of a pastry cook / who , as a journalist and during his exile in
England	LOCATION	, had picked up a ' specious and sub - terranean knowledge of European politics , ' enabling him ` to pose as a great authority on foreign affairs . '

		He further stigmatizes him as ' thoroughly insincere and self-seeking . '

		To malign Brissot is a literary diversion as old as the Eevolution itself .

		It was good Jacobins like
Camille Desmoulins	PERSON	who organized the tra - dition .

		From such judgments it is refreshing to turn to a letter written , after the execution of the Girondins , to Sir
Samuel Eomilly	PERSON	, by
Etienne Pumont	PERSON	, one of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's friends , who says he never liked Brissot as a politician , but that this did not prevent him ' from doing justice to his virtues , to his private character , to his disinterestedness , to his social qualities as a husband , a father , a friend , and as an in - trepid advocate of the wretched negroes . '

		Such a lack of sympathy leads Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- donald to the verge of misstatement .

		The ' destruction ' of
Lyons	PERSON	is an illustration .

		He intimates that ' a considerable portion of the city was destroyed . '

		But it was only ridiculous monsters like
Collot	PERSON	d'Herbois who could poetize about a day when the passing traveller would discover on the site of
Lyons	PERSON	only a few cot - tages , ' which the friends of equality shall dwell in , living happily on the benefits of nature . '

		The ' considerable portion ' destroyed consisted of a few houses in the
wealthy quarter	DATE	of Bellecoeur .

		The Convention in its decree expressly ex - empted public buildings , buildings devoted to industry , and the dwellings of the poor .

		Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	's explanations of the Maximum and of the function of ' representatives on mission ' are scarcely more lucid or accurate .

		This is particularly unfortunate in case of the Max - imum , which was a curious wholesale applica - tion of an economic practice familiar under the Old Regime .

		The effect of the Revolution upon
England	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, even upon the Balkan peoples , is succinctly described in a final chapter by Mr.
G. P. Gooch	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately , nothing is said about the impression made in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is not a sufficient answer to say that this was pre - cluded by the title of the chapter .

		The steady sympathy which the republican Americans , themselves lately revolutionists , felt for Revo - lutionary
France	LOCATION	, even after the execution of the
King	LOCATION	, is significant .

		They made a distinc - tion between the essential Revolution and the deeds of the Robespierrist faction , -- a distinc - tion which some English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	critics , with latent aristocratic or monarchist prejudices , do not always succeed in keeping clear .

		The twenty-five chapters of this volume , taken as a whole , impress one as a remarkably useful setting forth of the facts essential to an understanding of the Revolution .

		If they are 164 THE DIAIi -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, not equally successful in interpreting it in a large and sympathetic spirit as the tragic con - summation of the long development of French institutions , this is probably due to the treat - ment of the middle period as a vulgar melo - drama .

Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Ex - ploration of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	is responsible for the increase of literature upon that subject which the year has produced , and is still to produce according to announcements of publish - ers .

		No other adventure into the wilderness changed so much of the
United States	LOCATION	domain from the unknown to the known , or made as much geography in the same time .

		The revival of interest in
Lewis	LOCATION	and
Clark	PERSON	has served to call fresh attention to the accomplishments of other courageous spirits sent forth to spy out the land before the advance of civilization .

		Few readers are possessed of a mind so pro- saic or a circulation so sluggish as not to be moved by a good story of adventure .

		Hero - worship is almost second-nature when called forth by indomitable courage , physical hard - ship , or triumphant achievement .

		In the guise of fiction , adventure has played and will con - tinue to play a large part as a motive in litera - ture .

		When transformed into history by a lively imagination and a facile pen , it claims scarcely less attention .

		Yet many prefer to learn of adventures in neither of these guises , but to go direct to the original sources when they are available , and to read in the ` first person singular ' the moving accidents by field and flood which befell the makers of continental trails .

		To satisfy this class of readers ,
Messrs.	LOCATION
A. S. Barnes & Company	ORGANIZATION	have prepared a series of reprints of personal descriptions of explorations under the title ' The Trail Makers . '

		The ten volumes constituting the series have been put into handy duodecimo shape , without reducing the type to an objectionable size .

		Eeprints of the original maps also are given , with introduc - tions and other useful addenda .

		Uniformity in style and care in details have produced a very attractive series .

		reading public at large .

		The expedition was made twelve years before the English explora - tions began on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast , and seventy years previous to any permanent settlement by that nation .

		It does not come into touch with the history of the
United States	LOCATION	, until the open - ing of the
Santa Fe Trail	ORGANIZATION	and our territorial expansion disclosed its fruits in the province of
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		This comparatively remote historical field will be made accessible to many readers by the volume entitled ` Coronado 's Journey , ' The official and private descriptions made by several of the participants have been taken from the Spanish archives and translated into English by Dr.
George Parker Winship	PERSON	, who has added an excellent itinerary of the various Spanish expeditions in
America	LOCATION	.

		The foot-notes made by Mr.
Winship	PERSON	are so useful that one wishes a similar attention had been paid the remaining volumes .

		Admitting that annotations are distracting and that ' editors ' commonly over-annotate , the fact remains that in reprints treating of remote places and per - sons notes are valuable for the sake of identi - fication .

		They would have materially increased the value of another volume in the series -- a reprint of the voyages and travels of
Daniel Williams Harmon	PERSON	, for twelve years connected with the fur companies of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a partner in the
Northwest Fur Company	ORGANIZATION	and in charge of the company interests beyond the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, he made these observations while leading the life of a white man among savages .

		The original was probably printed in
1820	DATE	.

		This uncertainty of the date of original publication would have been cleared by the introduction of facsimiles of title-pages , as is done in some reprints .

		The
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	reprint occupies three volumes .

		A few pages containing an introduc - tory sketch of the purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, by Professor
McMaster	PERSON	, are placed in the first volume .

		Otherwise , the introductions in the series are of minor merit .

		The
Biddle	PERSON	edition of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	papers is followed .

		Two volumes are given to
Alexander Mac	ORGANIZATION	- kenzie 's Voyages to the Arctic and the
Pacific	LOCATION	oceans in
1789	DATE	and
1793	DATE	.

		As the first
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean known to written history to cross the continent in its northern portion ,
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's name will always be of interest .

		Having charge of the
Northwest Fur Company	ORGANIZATION	's post at De - troit , and ordered to make explorations in the back country , he undertook the journeys , and wrote descriptions , which were first printed in
London	LOCATION	in
1801	DATE	, He settled negatively the question , long in dispute , of the possible exists ence of a northwestern water-passage to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		THE BIALr 165 upon the natural history of the vast regions he traversed are of no small value .

		Much more recent than these journeys , and made for quite a different object , was that of Sir
George William Francis Butler	PERSON	, an officer of the British army stationed in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Pure - ly for the love of adventure , he traversed the va , st solitudes lying between the northern for - ests and the barren lands .

		He passed along the Eed Eiver of the North to
Lake Athabasca	LOCATION	and along the
Peace River	LOCATION	to the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, thence turning to the
Frazer River	LOCATION	.

		His ac - count of the trip was first published in
1872	DATE	.

		There was need of a popular reprint of Cad - wallader
Colden	PERSON	's ' History of the Five N ^ a - tions , ' but why it was placed in a series on trail - makers is not easy to ascertain .

		Its publication in
1747	DATE	no doubt accomplished the object the writer had in calling British attention to the menace of the French on the northern border of their American colonies , and to the service the
Five Nations	ORGANIZATION	would render if properly allied to the English and used as a barrier against the French .

		The history also served at the time to call forth an early , if not the first , attention of
Europe	LOCATION	to American letters .

		The author was a scholar and scientist , and his history is too valuable an authority on early
North America	LOCATION	to disappear by being allowed to drop from print .

		* Those who have used
John Bellows	PERSON	's excellent French pocket-dictionary , -- and its users are legion , -- will be pleased to learn that its com - piler was much more than a lexicographer , that he was in fact the verj ' last sort of man one would take to be a maker of dictionaries .

		That his tiny roan-bound , prayerbook-like ' Diction - ary for the Pocket ' was among the most highly prized volumes in
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	's library , is probably known to many ; but that he himself was one of the Autocrat 's valued friends and correspondents is not so well known .

		With Senator
Hoar	PERSON	also he was on the friendliest terms .

		It may be remembered that at the Har - vard commencement of three years ago Mr.
Bel	PERSON	- lows walked with the Senator -LRB- who was Presi - dent of the
Alumni Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- at the head of the procession , on his way to
Sanders Theatre	PERSON	to receive his honorary
M.A.	LOCATION	degree .

		At that time he and Mrs.

		Bom at
Liskeard	LOCATION	,
Cornwall	LOCATION	, in
1831	DATE	,
John Bellows	PERSON	early learned the printer 's trade , and rose , when little over thirty , to be master of the foremost printing-house in
Gloucester	LOCATION	.

		But his business was allowed to absorb by no means all his energies .

		Humanitarian movements of many kinds appealed to him , and he was sent on numerous missions of mercy by the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	, in whose councils his weight and influence came more and more to be recognized and valued .

		Among his good works of this kind may be mentioned journeys to
France	LOCATION	in aid of the sufferers from the war of
1870	DATE	, to
Russia	LOCATION	and the
Caucasus	LOCATION	in behalf of the Stun - dists and other persecuted sects , to
Turkey	LOCATION	for the purpose of helping the Armenians , and to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	in the interest of the
Doukho	PERSON	- bors , whose emigration to
Canada	LOCATION	was in no small measure the result of his activity and generosity , other English Quakers acting with him .

		That he sought out
Count Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	in the course of these Russian missions , and that the two became warmly attached , goes without say - ing .

		Incidentally , it was work of this sort in foreign lands that made
John Bellows	PERSON	feel the need of serviceable pocket dictionaries of the languages he had occasion to use .

		A visit to
Norway	LOCATION	had first suggested to him the compila - tion of a Norwegian dictionary ; but he soon became convinced that a French one would be more generally useful .

		Hence the publication , after seven years of intermittent labor upon it , of the now familiar work that bears his name .

		As an antiquary versed in the Roman antiquities of
Britain	LOCATION	, and especially of
Gloucester	LOCATION	,
John Bellows	PERSON	's fame was not confined to his own country .

		Foreign antiquarian societies elected him to membership and solicited his literary contributions .

		As a Liberal Unionist in polities , he exerted an influence that was hand - somely acknowledged by
Ijord Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was held in high esteem by his business asso - ciates , his friends both at home and abroad were many , his family life appears to have been all that heart could desire , and when death came , at seventy-one , nine children and a devoted wife surrounded his death-bed .

		This outline of his life is bald and meagre enough ; but let us turn to some of his written and spoken utterances , and we shall perhaps catch a suggestion of the man 's peculiar charm .

		Moral earnestness , fearless candor , a hatred of cant , a lively fancy , and a loving heart are what we shall not fail to discover in his always entertain - ing letters to wife , children , and friends .

		First , a passage from his wife 's narrative will show the struggle he had to make before he could bring himself to a strict observance of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	customs . '

		He never shrank from a course that he felt it right to take , because of the pain involved in it .

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, He never chose the easier way .

		The change of dress was not bo much of a trial to him as the change in speech ; but , having made up his mind as to his right course , he never faltered , though at times the anguish of mind that he passed through was almost more than he could endure .

		He thought it necessary to explain to the work-girls under him the great change that had taken place in his out - look on life , and , that for the future he would have to address them in
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	language , though he had a morbid dread of the manner in which this might be received .

		Those who knew him later can imagine the scene where he melted these rough girls to tears by his narrative .

		One of them , when he had fin - ished , became spokeswoman for the rest , assuring him , with tears , that they hoped he would never shrink from doing and saying what he felt , in his conscience , to be right . '

		Here are some suggestive passages from a letter to
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	acknowledg - ing the receipt of ' Over the Teacups ' : ' One mystery thy volume has set me further away than ever from solving : and that is , `` Where is the boundary between childhood and boyhood ; or boyhood and manhood and -LSB- old -RSB- age ?

		This I have never been able to find ... Only this very evening I was wheedled into an interlude from the '' Teacups , '' by a deputation of four
Gallios	PERSON	who care for none of these things , to entreat that I would '' give them a chase . ''

		Seven-year-old put the request m a very low voice ; for a '' chase '' in this house is forbidden by the mistress on the ground that it makes dust : it destroys the carpets : it leaves finger-marks on the walls : it tears the clothes : it upsets the furniture : with other high crimes and misdemeanors which are duly set forth in the manifesto that forbids chasing ' ' in - doors . ''

		... So , being obliged to go , I went ; and once in the game , even five-year-old herself could not throw her heart and soul into it more entirely !

		Boy !

		Why , I never was more of a boy in my life !

		What boy in the whole world ever cared about carpets in the midst of a chase ?

		And did I care one straw whether they were old sacks , or Cloth of Gold , or the High Priest of Mecca 's prayer rugs , if by racing over them I could catch two of those hares at one hit ?

		Why , here is a game older than
Adam !	PERSON

		The old hunting instinct of the cave-men , as a modern author has shown , came down to us by heredity ; an instinct that has scores of times transformed me into a bear , under the di - ning-room table , and which only the counterbalancing force of civilized life kept from transforming me into an elephimt after our chase was over just now -- crawling into the room with three men on my back , and one leading me !

		I do not think that any - thing in this life has more puzzled me than this con - sciousness that the bound between boyhood and manhood `` Is marked by no distinguishable line ; The turf unites , the pathways intertwine . ''

		The secret is this -LRB- ? -RRB-

		that we go on adding to our existing ring of life , as the ammonites do with their spiral shells .

		We include all that has gone before ; hence we can keep more fully in touch or in sym - pathy with children , than they can with us . '

		The descriptions which his letters from south - eastern
Russia	LOCATION	give of Caucasian scenery and people , and of the hardships and perils of travel in that wild region , are extremely interesting , but must not be spoiled by mutilation .

		From an account of a visit to Count
Tolstoi	PERSON	and his family in
Moscow	LOCATION	, in
1893	DATE	, illustrative passages may be taken . '

		He was exceedingly glad to see me , and I felt bound up in him more than I can express .

		There are some things in which we see eye to eye ; and others that t know to a certainty he is mistaken in , and which I would give much to open his eyes to .

		To-day , besides the conversation at his own .

		house , he accompanied me for many miles over
Moscow	LOCATION	on foot and in the trams ... Little
Ivan	PERSON	is five : his sister
Alexandra	PERSON	, a most lovely child of eight ... The two little ones dragged nie off , at this point , to the nursery , to shew li .

		.

		their toys and their brother 's puppy . ''

		An Eng - lish pointer , Mr.
Bellows	PERSON	. '' ''

		What is his name ? '' ''

		O , he has not got a name yet .

		You see it is -- a little girl -- and my brother would rather have a little boy : so it will be changed . ''

		Ivan 's Eng - lish is hardly so perfect as his sister 's .

		It was delightful to see his earnestness as he strove aiter words to say what he wanted . '

		In
1890	DATE	, a newspaper account of the suffer - ings undergone by American cattle on their way to
Europe	LOCATION	so pained Mr.
Bellows	PERSON	that he resolved to eat no more meat .

		Two years later he felt it his duty to abstain also from fish .

		In connection with this sensitiveness of conscience the following passages are of interest .

		The first is from a letter written to his wife from southeastern
Eussia	LOCATION	; the second is from Mrs.
Bellows	PERSON	's narrative . '

		As to my interest in science during the journey , I get along excellently with my companions ; for although they have not the same tastes , I am often able to interest them with some details .

		They are exceedingly nice and very unselfish : always trying to give me the most comfortable place , etc. .

		As to food , we have got on all the better in the last few days for the fast of the Greek Church ; for this leads to the Hotels and Eestaurants having a sort of double menu : vegetarian for the '' orthodox . ''

		I conclude to discontinue fish : for I could not kill them myself ; and if I can not kill , I will not let others kill for me .

		That the most robust health and strength can be maintained without eating flesh is shown by the porters of Tiflis , who are practically vegetarians . ' '

		During his visit to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	in
1892	DATE	he was dining one evening with a gentleman , who enquired of him if he had been at a certain ball on the previous evening , and if he had seen such and such a play .

		To these enquiries
John Bellows	PERSON	had to reply in the negative ; and , further , that he had never been to a ball or to a theatre in his life .

		This statement was so astounding to his host that he laid down his knife and fork , looked fixedly at him , and exclaimed : '' You never go to balls , you do n't go to the theatre , you drink no wine , and you eat no meat ; then do tell me if your life is worth living at all ! ''

		But it was not on such things .

		as these that
John Bellows	PERSON	depended for his happiness ; and yet it would have been hard to find , anyone who got more ketu enjoyment out of life than he did : certainly no one was more interested in every phase of it , from the spiritual welfare of a nation to the passing amusement of a child . '

		In his visit to this country , the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	from
Gloucester	LOCATION	was especially interested in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia and the people he met there .

		As a philologian he noted local pronunciation and
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 167 idioms .

		He recognized Cornish words and inton - ations in the speech of some Pennsylvanians .

		` They say , for instance , a house is torn down -LRB- which is not English ! -RRB-

		They have told me , when I have once or twice spoken in their meetings , they have been struck with my tone being much nearer their own than that of Eng - lish Friends generally is ! '

		The book reveals many of
John Bellows	PERSON	's lovable traits .

		So used was he to picking up solitary foot-passengers when he was driving alone , that his horse often embarrassed him by stopping whenever a pedes - trian was overtaken .

		On one occasion Mr.
Bellows	PERSON	persisted in bringing a pleasant visit to a close on a fixed day , although urged to stay and desiring to stay to attend a picnic , because he had promised a poor boy in
London	LOCATION	that he should carry his bag if he would meet a certain train ; and there was no means of arranging a postponement with the boy .

		The lesson to be learned from
John Bellows	PERSON	's life may best be indicated in his own words refer - ring to diversities of belief but the same spirit . '

		In going through life , no two of us have pre - cisely the same path to tread .

		Yet we can not con - template the step by which another soul has over - come the world , without being helped in our own , though different , path to the same end .

		If we are in a right state of mind , we shall be in sympathy with such a man , notwithstanding that the truths which were the principal ones he was called to con - tend for , may not , at present , even be shown to us at all .

		Unity of spirit does not lie in holding the same views of things , or learning the same outward lessons ; but m loving and cherishing the truth in whatever direction it is made manifest to us . '

		Tolerance toward all was repeatedly preached by this most tolerant of men .

		A better ac - quaintance between nations , be held , would lead to that international tolerance which would make war impossible . '

		Even individually / he adds , ' if we experience dislike toward a person , such a feeling lessens as we come to know him more closely , and enter into his trials and sor - rows : for it is impossible to hate even a wicked man if we know all about him . '

		He might well have summed this up in his favorite French : ' Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner . '

		The book does credit to its printers , -- Messrs.
Max	PERSON	and
William Bellows	PERSON	, sons of
John	ORGANIZATION	, -- as well as to its compiler .

		Some of its misused terms , however , as applied by an Englishman to things in
America	LOCATION	, are amusing .

		The Mas - sachusetts legislature is called a
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and the close of its annual session is referred to as a prorogation .

		The Old South Church figures as the Old South Chapel .

		The writer speaks of driving up the side of
Lake Wachusett	LOCATION	to the hotel at its summit , evidently meaning
Mount Wachusett	LOCATION	.

		Problems of the
American City	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Our most kindly foreign critic , Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, told us twenty years ago that the one great failure of American politics was munic - ipal government .

		The statement was not chal - lenged at the time , as it was the popular opinion of the American people , who con - fessed , with chagrin or indifference , that in American cities democracy had failed .

		During the
last two decades	DATE	we have wit - nessed an amazing change .

		Municipal govern - ment has grown more efficient and less cor - rupt , while national and state governments have in many instances gro ^ vn less efficient and more corrupt .

		To-day the hope of democracy is in the city , as one can not doubt who reads Dr.
Wilcox	PERSON	's book with the attention it deserves .

		The author has had a wide range of experience , both as student and municipal reformer ; not the least of his advantages having been that of participating in the recent struggle of
Grand Kapids	LOCATION	for civic righteousness .

		Dr.
Wilcox	PERSON	states this problem in democracy in a logical and scientific manner , indicating the signifi - cance of the growth of cities ; the place which industry occupies in determining the conditions of self-government ; the fundamental impor - tance in the city of the street and the public utilities ; the dependence of citizenship upon civic education , the control of leisure , and cooperation ; the significance of local organiza - tion , and the importance of municipal home - rule .

		The investigation concludes with a practical discussion of municipal finance and a suggested programme of civic effort .

		The great merits of the book are an apprecia - tion of the difficulties and possibilities of democratic administration , and a minute knowl - edge of the details of civic life .

		The author is equally sound in his discussion of the vexed problem of regulating vice , the immense pos - sibilities of the public schoolhouse or other civic centre , the relative importance of mayor and coTincil , executive and legislative functions , and the value of modern democratic devices , such as the initiative referendum , proportional rep - resentation , and the recall .

		The author is thor - ough-going and courageous in his democracy .

		He says : ' It is fitting that in the study of city conditions and municipal government in the
United States	LOCATION	we should strive to comprehend the relation existing between democracy and this marvellous phenom - enon , the city , looming so large upon our horizon and dominating more and more our whole political , industrial and social life .

		Democracy has not been fully tested , and its record of achievement is such that we , of modern days , believe its ultimate failure would mean the failure of progress itself .

		To us the right of every man to count for what he is really worth has come to be an essential part of the •

		168 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, justification of life .

		We look upon the egregious blunders of our cities and listen to Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's oft - repeated dictum about the '' one conspicuous fail - ure '' amoUfj our institutions , and still maintain that what we need is not less democracy but more .

		* We see that the experiment of democracy must be begun over again under the changed conditions of industrial and social life , and that in the new experiment cities must take the lead .

		That thus far democracy has failed to justify itself in the cities of
America	LOCATION	is commonly believed .

		Yet 'm in the nature of the case the richest field for democ - racy and in them the principle of political co-opera - tion may be carried furthest .

		If the people prove themselves worthy of political power , municipal institutions will surely lead the van in the political progress of the world . '

		The book is so valuable that it would seem ungracious to point out minor flaws , were it not that they can he remedied in the subse - quent editions .

		Dr.
Wilcox	PERSON	occasionally takes liberties with his English , misleading the reader by failing to use words in their current signif - icance .

		The chapter on ' The Control of Leis - ure ' deals not only with recreative institutions , but discusses -LRB- with much acumen , it must be admitted -RRB- gambling , prostitution , and public baths . '

		Municipal Insurance ' is a term which covers the fire and police departments , boiler inspection , tenement houses , and pure water , -- giving a rhetorical twist to a terra which technically applies to the municipality 's pro- tection of its own property .

		The chapters on ' Civic Education ' and ' A Programme of Civic Effort ' are satisfactorily described in the titles ; but ' Civic Cooperation ' is a phrase used to describe municipal activities in another chapter .

		These defects are worthy of notice only because they are anomalous in the pages of a writer with such a fund of information and such clear vision as the author of ' The American City . '

Anthony W. Margraff	PERSON	.

		Chicago :
Fergus Printing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		burn 's ' History of Coinage and Currency in the
United States	LOCATION	' is not likely to run through many editions .

		The author is perhaps right in his belief that ' there is no one work of con - venient size and popular character covering the history of the coinage and currency of the
United States	LOCATION	, with data and details in chrono - logical order , available as a book of reference , ' though Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's ' Financial
Historj	PERSON	- of the
United States	LOCATION	' fulfils the first part of this expressed need in an admirable manner .

		As a ' book of reference , ' Mr.
Hepburn	PERSON	's volume certainly has value , though it may l -RRB- e suggested that for this purpose the first part of the title would appeal more to sober students of the subject than the more aggressive second part which appears on the back of the volume .

		It is to be feared that the book can not make clear it `` claim to be ' a work of popular char - acter , ' for Mr.
Hepburn	PERSON	's history is for the most part a colorless one , and the author 's style is not such as to make up for this lack of critical comment .

		The earlier chapters , on the Coinage System , are chiefly a recital of well known events , with - out much attempt to point out their signifi - cance .

		The author gives an interesting expla - nation of the reason why the legal ratio of 16 to 1 was adopted in 1834-37 , when the ratio between silver and gold was changed from 15 to 1 .

		The ratio to which most European bimetallic countries adhered was I5I/2 to 1 , and this was also not far removed from the market ratio ; but Mr.
Hepburn	PERSON	asserts that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	knowingly undervalued silver , hoping thereby to draw to this country gold from
Central	ORGANIZATION	and
South America	LOCATION	, as well as to retain the output of the new gold-mines then being opened up in
North Carolina	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		Benton ,
Calhoun	PERSON	, and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	all supported the new ratio ; and the above explanation indicates that in so doing they believed that they were in fact establishing the gold standard .

		Such indeed proved to be the case , since the coinage of silver dollars practically ceased from that date .

		In his review of the history of
State Banking	ORGANIZATION	between
1837	DATE	and
1849	DATE	, the author has brought together and summarized the researches of sev - eral essayists ; and this is one of the best and most readable portions of his book .

		He attrib - utes the partial failure of the
New York	LOCATION	Safety-fund system at this time to the fact that the fund was made applicable not only to the note circulation but to all the indebtedness of the banks , and is unwilling to believe that these failures point to any defects in the Safety - fund system of protecting note holders .

		Mr.
Hepburn	PERSON	gives to Mr.
Windom	PERSON	, by impli - cation at least , the credit for having originated the Silver-purchase act of
1890	DATE	, since he resrards the so-called
Sherman	PERSON	act as merelv
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 169 Congressional tinkering with the
Windom	PERSON	meas - ure .

		In this connection , Secretary
Windom	PERSON	himself comes in for this somewhat doubtful compliment : * He wouM no doubt have favored the soundest system of money had it been politic to do so , but it was not , in his judgment , wise to fly in the face of the people .

		Few men could have so skilfully devised a plan calculated to satisfy the silver advo - cates , the Grcienbackers , the gold men , and the infla - tionists , as well as those who favored contraction . '

		In a work like the present one , written by a man who has himself been actively engaged in administering the laM 's of M'hich he treats , our chief interest is in his opinions concerning the efficiency of legislation for current needs .

		Mr.
Hepburn	PERSON	gives us such a summary of his views in the last twenty pages of his text ; and , though we read them with interest , and with due respect for the authority with which they are presented , it can not be said that they reveal anything that is strikingly new or wholly con - vincing .

		Bimetallism he considers to be a moribund issue ; but he fears that in times of business stagnation the existence of the large silver coinage in our currency may prove a menace which can only be guarded against hy continuing a large
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	surplus into which the silver may be thrown .

		The danger is in - creased by the presence of the Greenbacks ; but , on the other hand , it is lessened by the need for this currency in every-day transactions , and for bank reserves .

		The Sub-treasury system re - ceives , of course , its due share of criticism for producing a monetary stringency whenever the Federal revenues are largely in excess of expen - ditures , and there is presented once more the banker 's plan of salvation , -- the deposit of the government funds in the banks of reserve cities .

		We are also reminded that a - bank currency based on bond security will always be non - elastic , and that both security and elasticity can be secured by means of a Safety-fund system , and by a guarantee fund provided by means of taxation .

		The experiences of the German Keichsbank and of the Canadian banks are relied upon for proofs of this latter assertion .

		The character of Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's ' History of the Greenbacks ' will be appreciated when it is stated that it has already taken rank as the standard treatise on this interesting and im - portant epoch of our monetary and financial history .

		Not only is the investigation thorough and well-nigh exhaustive for the period it cov - ers , but , aside from the rather tedious analysis of the statistics of wages and prices , the mat - ter is presented in an attractive style .

		The sig - nificant fact which is revealed by the author 's account of the conditions at the opening of the war is that the low credit of the government at this time , of which the apologists for the Greenback legislation have made so much , was not due to inability to get revenue so much as it was to Secretary Chase 's determination not to resort to taxation as a means of carrying on the war .

		It seems also to have been demon - strated that the
$ 150,000,000	MONEY	loan of
1861	DATE	was not the cause of the suspension of specie pay - ments , as has often been averred ; for Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	shows that the banks were not seriously inconvenienced by this demand , since the dis - bursements of the government were so rapid that the specie soon returned to the banks .

		It was Secretary Chase 's annual report showing a disappointing condition of the government finances , coupled with the uneasiness caused by the Trent affair , which produced the panic in the
New York	LOCATION	markets and compelled suspen - sion .

		The plea of necessity which was potent in producing the legal-tender acts , and which has been accepted as an excuse by many a writer since that time , is here shown to have had force only in so far as it reveals the unwilling - ness of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and of the Secretary to sell bonds for what they would bring in the open market .

		In this connection it is well to remem - ber Mr.
Fessendon	PERSON	's answer to those who claimed that the government ought not to pay over six per cent for money . '

		Money in the market , ' he replied , ` is always worth what it will sell for .

		It is an ai ^ ticle of merchandise , like anything else ; and the government has no reason to suppose , unless it can offer much bet - ter security , that it should get money at a bet - ter rate than anybody else . '

		The economic consequences of the
Green	ORGANIZATION	- back legislation can be only briefly alluded to ; and , indeed , the full consequences can not be realized from the history of these four years , as the author well recognizes .

		It is not sur - prising , of course , to learn that gold and silver coins disappeared from circulation , except in
California	LOCATION	, where there was a deep-seated prej - udice against all forms of paper money ; but it does cause some wonder t < '' find that the smaller coins , even those of nickel and bronze , were hoarded and commanded a premium .

		This premium was due , in the first instance , not to the high specie value of these coins , but to the great need for small change which resulted from the disappearance of the small silver coins .

		The ' shinplasters ' were soon called into requi - sition to supply this deficiency .

		The history of the Greenbacks does not , in Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's opinion , tend to strengthen the position of the quantity theorists .

		A lengthy study of the fluctuations in the value of the currency leads him to the conclusion that ` the quantity of the Greenbacks influenced their specie value rather by affecting the credit of the government than by altering the volume of the circulatinsr medium . '

		170 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	The author ^ s elaborate treatment of the movement of wages and prices during the war can not be described here , nor can we devote space to his criticism of the materials with which he has had to deal , and the use of them by earlier investigators .

		We must content our - selves with the statement that his analysis and conclusions support the commonly accepted theory that changes in the value of the cur - rency are more quickly reflected in the move - ments of prices than in those of wages .

		This means that the wage-earners during the Civil War paid , on account of the Greenbacks , a cur - rency tax for the support of the war equal to ' perhaps a fifth or a sixth of real incomes . '

		In reality , however , this can hardly be said to have been a tax , since the benefits accrued not to the government but to the employers , who found their profits swelled by the fact that prices rose more rapidly than wages .

		To a slight degree , the position of the wage-earner was rendered less serious by a rise of rents less rapid than the rise of prices .

		The final effect of the Greenbacks noted by Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	is the in - creased cost of the war due to this legislation .

		He calculates this additional expense to have been
$ 791,000,000	MONEY	, while the addition to the war-debt due to the use of paper money was in the neighborhood of
$ 589,000,000	MONEY	.

		This is a more conservative statement of the situation than has been furnished by the estimates of earlier writers .

		Mr.
Margraff	PERSON	's book on ' International Ex - change ' is not one which lends itself easily to the reviewer 's art , since it is the author 's pur - pose not to give a systematic presentation of the theory of foreign exchange , but rather ' gen - eral practical information ' of especial value to bankers and exporters and importers .

		The text is accordingly of a descriptive and explanatory character , discussing such subjects as foreign bills of exchange , letters of credit , foreign bank - ing systems , arbitrage , gold exports and im - ports , and the monetary systems of foreign countries .

		The matter is clearly presented , without any waste of words , and would prove interesting and instructive to a much wider circle of readers than that for which it is primarily intended .

		A delightful biography of Miss Edge-worth .

		Timely to the newly awak - ened interest in Irish litera - ture , which is gradually broad - ening to include more than modern mysticism , comes another volume in the ` English Men of Letters ' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- upon Maria Edge - worth .

		It is appropriately written by her dis - tinguished coim try - woman , the Hon. Emily Law - less .

		Miss Lawless explains that ail Miss Edge - worth 's other biographies have been English , with the result that the purely Irish side of her writ - ings , and their influence in
Ireland	LOCATION	itself , have been pretty much neglected .

		It is upon her atten - tion to these matters , and her use of some hith - erto unpublished letters , that the author relies for novelty and interest in a field already well explored ; but in reality it is her own personality that gives the greatest charm to her work , -- her quick humor , her strong power to vivify a situa - tion or a character , her gift of lively narration , her command of fine nervous English .

		It is as a very loveable woman , rather than as a success - ful authoress , that
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	interests her biographer ; and she certainly draws a delightful picture of Maria in her father 's home , with its bewildering succession of wives and its seventeen children .

		There was little opportunity for soli - tude there , between children and
Richard Lovell Edgeworth	PERSON	's theories ; but this did not disturb
Maria	LOCATION	.

		She wrote apparently just as she did dozens of other things in the busy day 's round , and submitted her work to her father exactly as she would have submitted any other household affair to him .

		Miss Lawless has more sympathy for Mr.
Edgeworth	PERSON	than some previous commen - tators , although she admits that he did his worst for Maria by blunting her never strong imagina - tion and insisting upon the moral issues of every tale .

		She wonders how he even let the utterly un-moral ` Castle Rackrent ' escape his censorship .

		This she considers not only by far
Maria	ORGANIZATION	's best book , but the best story that ever came out of
Ireland	LOCATION	, The friendship with
Scott	PERSON	, and the exchange of visits between
Abbotsford	LOCATION	and Edge - worthstown , form one of the most interesting episodes of
Miss Edgeworth	LOCATION	's later life .

		Alto - gether we feel that Miss LaAvless fully proves her point , -- namely , that
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	, though not of course in the first rank as a writer , stands in what is perhaps quite as enviable a position as ` one of the very pleasantest personalities to be met with in the whole wide world of books . '

		For some years past , the Biblical play has held the stage of pub - lie attention and commercial success when the play of contemporary setting and current thought has often had but a brief and inconspicuous life .

		The latest addition to the growing fund is Miss
Florence Wilkinson	PERSON	's ` Two Plays of
Israel	LOCATION	' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The longer of them , ` David of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, ' is the work of several years , and is said to be the first of the recent plays concerned with that subject .

		There seems to be some possibility that it will be seen on the stage , Mr.
E. H. Sothern	PERSON	having bought the dramatic rights to it some years ago .

		The second play in the volume is entitled `
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	, ' and is much less considerable , in various respects , than its companion .

		In Biblical plays , as in the case of all stories that belong to the common fund of history and tradition , the thread and denouement of the story are virtually known in advance .

		This places an extra burden on the new interpreter , since the appeal of nar - rative interest can no longer be paramount .

		Some new Biblical plays .

		1904 -RSB- THE DIAI .

		ITl
Phillips	PERSON	and D'Annmizio ,
Crawford	PERSON	and
Boker	PERSON	, had but the slender thread of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's story from which to weave their delicate and extensive fabric of dramatic texture .

		The charm and virtue of each play lay in the individual vitality which each author poured into the meagre mould of fact .

		Miss
Wilkinson	PERSON	has proved inadequate to accomplish with noteworthy success this most difficult feat of dramatic art .

		In ` David of Beth - lehem , ' the structure itself is not well mortised ; the constituent parts are not in themselves well poised .

		The incidents and situations designed to hold the spectator are seldom powerfully di-a - matic , smacking more of stage craft than of dra - matic art .

		The diction in many places is absurdly inappropriate .

		Such sentences as * Ay , a good dream for them as find it good , but a bad dream for some others ' by the witch whom
Saul	PERSON	con - sults , ` It do so ,
Lady Miehal	PERSON	, and that puts me in mind of my herbs for
Hurai	ORGANIZATION	' by the old gar - dener in Act .

		II. , and other like expressions , sug - gest the idea that
David Harum	PERSON	's vernacular has remained unchanged from the time of
David	PERSON	until our own day .

		The second of the two plays , `
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	, ' is pitched more in a key of poetry than the other , and contains passages that are not devoid of beauty .

		But from the dramatic standpoint , the play has one fatal flaw .

		The crucial moment , the decision at the crisis , is lamentably weaK , because there is no suggestion that the controlling motive in that decision has a profound physical , moral , or spiritual basis and cause , as in the case of ` La Samaritaine ' or
` Mary of Magdala	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Although this play is freer from verbal and phrasal incongruities than its predecessor , it is hard to forgive
Miss Wilkinson	PERSON	for accrediting
Philip	LOCATION	, the
Tetrarch	ORGANIZATION	, with the coinage of such a nineteenth-century word as ` crassly . '

		Mr.
N. Kilburn	PERSON	, in a prefatory note to ` The Story of Chamber Music ' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , asks the question as to which of the great forms of musieaJ composition we would plead for in case all the rest were doomed to destruction .

		` Music for the orchestra , with its vivid colours , its strength and delicacy ; the vast range of choral music ; works for the organ , that huge modern plexus of pipe and reed , -- these and others no doubt have strong claims on our musical affec - tions .

		But , if forced to such a choice , it is cer - tain that many a musician would , without hesita - tion , pledge himself to uphold the claims of cham - ber music ; for who can measure the almost infi - nite variety and charm which it affords , and that too with the slenderest means ? '

		The term cham - ber music , strictly speaking , embraces composi - tions in the form of duets , trios , quartettes , and other larger combinations , for strings -LRB- i. e. , vio - lins , violas , ` cellos , and double basses -RRB- , and for wind instruments , both with and without the pianoforte .

		In the treatise mentioned , the author has traced the beginnings of chamber music , which originated very early in the sixteenth century , and follows minutely the development of this class of composition , to which nearly all great composers have contributed their share .

		The story of chamber music .

		Regarding the present-day tendency , Mr.
Kilburn	PERSON	laments that many chamber works are written too much in orchestral style , and that there has arisen an inclination on the part of some com - posers to make this form express more than it seems naturally fitted to do , to introduce the programme idea into chamber music -- such as
Raff	ORGANIZATION	's Op. 192 , ` Die
Schone Mullerin	PERSON	, ' and Sme - tana 's ` Aus meinem Leben . '

		The present volume is undoubtedly the most complete work on the subject extant , and is the result of painstaking research and study .

		A chronological and bio - graphical appendix adds to its value .

		French romantic The translation of ` Main Cur - writersofthe rents of
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	last century .

		Literature , ' the great critical work of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, goes on apace .

		We have already reviewed the first three volumes of this translation , and the fifth now appears from the press of the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, -- the fourth , on ` Naturalism in
England	LOCATION	, ' having been for the moment postponed .

		The subject of this fifth vol - ume is ` The Romantic School , in
France	LOCATION	, ' thus forming the necessary sequence to ` The Reaction in
Prance	LOCATION	, ' which is the subject of the third vol - ume .

		The history now proceeds , after a recapit - ulation of the political and social conditions , the influences domestic and foreign , that shaped the generation of
1830	DATE	, to discuss at length the work of Nodier ,
Vigny	LOCATION	, Hugo , Musset , George Sand ,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Beyle	PERSON	,
Merimee	PERSON	,
Gautier	PERSON	, and Sainte-Beuve .

		These ten authors have one or more chapters each -LRB- Balzac and Merimee no less than six apiece -RRB- , and their work is discussed upon the broadest historical and philosophical basis .

		Three or four closing chapters sum up the period , gathering up the loose ends of the discussion , and supplying matters ` overlooked and forgot - ten ' in the preceding chapters .

		This volume is probably the ablest section of the great critical work to which it belongs .

		The author 's closing words describe the French romantic school as ` the greatest literary school of the nineteenth century , ' and his treatment fairly makes good the claim , showing , as it does , how in all direc - tions , this influence ` revitalised style , ' and ` insin - uated itself as a fertilising power into the science of history , as an inspiring power into politics . '

		The volume is throughout written con amore , and displays , if possible , deeper insight and firmer grasp than its predecessors .

		It is indispensable to the serious student of modern literature .

		A book on 17th century manners .

		` Social Life under the Stuarts ' is the title of a rather amor - phous ; volume written by `
Eliza	PERSON	- beth
Godfrey	PERSON	' and imported by
Messrs. E. P	PERSON	,
Duttoii & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upon examination , the Stuarts prove to be the first two Kings of that name , and the social life includes anything relating to the manners and customs of the upper classes , from gossip , dress , and amusements in town and country , to such weighty matters as science , art , music , iitei-ature , and religion .

		Practically this volume is a continuation of a previous one on the home-life of the same period , only that its scope is slightly broader .

		As before , the material is 172 THE PTALi -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	& , drawn chiefly from the letters , memoirs , and diaries which best miiTor the private life of the time , --
George Herbert	PERSON	,
Izaak Walton	PERSON	, Lady
Brilliana Harley	PERSON	,
Herrick	PERSON	,
Endymion Porter	PERSON	, and
Evelyn	PERSON	, being a few of the authorities oftenest quoted .

		With such liet ^ rogeneous subject-mat - ter , little unity is possible , except that the writer tries to limit her outlook to that of the eultui-ed man or woman of the day .

		The result , since the book wholly lacks distinction of style , is rather overpowering ; but as a reference work , putting into accessible and fairly popular form a good deal of hitherto unobtainable material , as well as some more familiar , it will fill a niche in many libraries .

		As citation is generally made verbatim , accuracy is of course ensured .

		Twenty illustra - tions from old prints and engravings form one of the most interesting features of the book .

		Literature of the Dark Ages .

		After much delay , a new volume has been added to the series of ` Periods of European Litera - ture ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It has for its subject ` The Dark Ages , ' and thus comes first in the chrono - logical order , although it stands as ninth in the order of publication .

		When we say that it is the work of Professor
W. P. Ker	PERSON	, little need be added by way of praise .

		The brilliant and accomplished author of ` Epic and
Romance	ORGANIZATION	' has hardly an equal among English scholars in this field , and the present work is probably the best of the entire series .

		As was to be expected , the author has given much attention to early Teutonic litera - ture -- Icelandic in particular , - treating of Old English in somewhat less detail by virtue of the fact that it is more familiar to the class of read - ers for whom this work is designed .

		The longest of the five chapters into which the book divides , nevertheless , is necessarily devoted to the Latin Avritings of the period covered , and here also we find displayed a thorough scholarship and a clear method of presentation .

		The treatment of Celtic poetry , although upon a closely restricted scale , is also satisfactoiy .

		Throughout the work , the author keeps in mind the interrelations between the several branches of the investigation , and fuses the disparate elements of his subject-matter into some degree of unity .

		In a word , he is successful in illuminating the darkest literai-y recesses of the centuries under discussion , and at the same time he contrives to give a touch of fresh interest to the dullest phases of his theme .

		The slight but charming sketch called ` The Hel - met of Mambrino , ' published in the ` Century ' magazine , is also literature , and occupies tbe place of honor in the present memorial volume .

		But the greater part of the volume is given up to per - sonal contributions embodying reminiscences of its subject .

		That these papers are highly readable is sufficiently attested by the names of their writ - ers , among whom are included Messrs.
John Hay	PERSON	, !


W. D. Howells	PERSON	,
Henry Adams	PERSON	,
John La Farge	PERSON	, E >
C. Stedman	PERSON	,
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	,
Edward Cary	PERSON	, and
D. C. Gilman	PERSON	.

		A fonnal biogi-aphy by Mr.
B. W. Raymond	PERSON	, some memorabilia by Mr.
James D '' Hague	PERSON	, and a technical paper on King as a geol - ogist by Mr.
S. F. Emmons	PERSON	, complete the contents of this interesting and beautifully-printed book .

		There are also a number of illustrations , mainly portraits of King at various ages and in various surroundings .

		If Mr '' .


Arthur Benson	PERSON	's volume on
Rossetti	PERSON	in the ' English Men of Letters ' series -LRB- Ma < ?

		millan -RRB- has veiy little of the fascination belonging to other biogi'aphies of the poet-painter , the absence of this quality is deliberate .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	gives hearty assent to the statement that
Rossetti	PERSON	's life has been treated by previous biographers ` too much in the Pre-Raphaelite manner . '

		Vast masses of detail have been presented , interesting in themselves but obscuring the central figure ; and the morbid and decadent elements of Ros - setti 's ehai * aeter have been emphasized almost to the exclusion of his brave and genial manliness .

		No doubt this is quite true , and perhaps nobpdy could have written a brief and business-like biog - raphy of
Rossetti	PERSON	, treating him as an English Man of Letters , any more satisfactorily than Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has done .

		In his biographical chapters , , readers of the Memoir , the Lettei-s , and the Diaries will feel a certain lack of environment and atmos - phere , a dimness of outline , a cautious verbal accuracy , that leaves them cold where they were wont to be most enthusiastic .

		Equally painstak - ing and far more satisfactory are the expository chapters dealing with the poems , translations , and pictures .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is a keen analyst , an appreciative and illuminating critic .

		For the facts about
Rossetti	PERSON	and a clear presentation of his work one need not go further than this vol - ume , whose disappointments are , after all , proba - bly inevitable .

		^ _ History of To trace a histoiy of the begin - the beginnings gings of music , from the vai `` ue ofuhisic .

		researches of antiquarians , and from pereonal investigations of rock carving 's , , paintings , marbles and sculpture , papjTi and parchments , etc. , has been the laborious task of Mr.
Hermann Smith	PERSON	in ` The World 's Earliest Music ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		As music is bound up with the manners and lives of peoples and nations , its courses of development can not rightly be judged apart from geography , ethnography , and history .

		The autlior of the present work has devoted a long life to his subject , especially to the instru - ments that made the music , their construction and scientific bearings and , i * ^ lations , practically and exi > erimeutally ; thus it has happened , as he him -
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 178 self points out , that many advantages seldom combined have favored the pursuit of the inves - tigations discursively related in the present vol - ume .

		To those students of music who give to the art most sincere and earnest thought , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's work will undoubtedly appeal , as similar works have appealed before .

		A sequel to the present book is contemplated , to be entitled ` Our Musical Inheritance . '

		BRIEFER MENTION , Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	's little book on ` The Mas - ters of English Literature , ' published by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, might find use as a school text-book , hut its aim is rather to enlist the interests of read - f-rs , particularly young readers , in the subject for its own sake , when not considered as a form of taskwork .

		Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	writes pleasingly and intel - ligently about the ` obligatory authors , ' as he calls them , the authors of whom ` no educated man in the English-speaking world can afford to profess entire ignorance . '

		The book is not overweighted with learning , and is agreeably diversified by the introduction of representative extracts from the siuthors considered .

		The group of recent French writers who have turned their attention to the study of English lit - erature have a faculty of finding interesting sub - jects M'hich our own critics and historians seem to miss .

		The latest illustration of this proposition is offered by Dr.
A. Barbeau	PERSON	's `
Une Ville d'Eaux Anglaise au'XVIITe Siecle	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Picard -RRB- , further described as a study of ` La Soci ^ te Elegante et Litteraire k Bath sous la
Eeine Anne	ORGANIZATION	et sous les Georges . '

		Xo one has done just this thing before , and M ,
Barbeau	PERSON	has now done it so well , basing his work upon so extensive an examination of source - material , that we fancy no one will be likely to try to better his example .

		The elaborate bibliography and index add greatly to the value of this interest - ing and scholarly production .

		` Chinese Made Easy , ' by Messrs.
Walter Brooks Brouner	PERSON	and
Fung Yuet Mow	PERSON	, is a publication of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We doubt very much the possi - bility of making the Chinese language really ` easy , ' but this handsomely-printed book will be a boon to students who are forced to acquire Chinese for mis - sionary or mercantile purposes .

		It has been printed in
Leyden	LOCATION	, and the last page is the first .

		Professor
Herbert A. Giles	PERSON	contributes a preface , and assures liis readers that whoever masters the contents of the book ` will find himself well advanced on the road towards a good acquaintance with the Chi - nese language . '

		The
Progressive Printing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, pub - lishes in a limited edition a thin volume of ' Gedichte von
Georg Sylvester Viereck	PERSON	, ' prefaced by a criti - cal appreciation from the hand of Mr.
Ludwig Lewisohn	PERSON	.


Herr Viereck	PERSON	is a young man of twenty , born in
Munich	LOCATION	of German-American parentage , and since 1897 a student in the schools of this country .

		His work is certainly remarkable , and we have read with interest every line of his volume .

		Ttr has color , passion , music , and imagination .

		It is verse shaped by the German influence of
Heine	PERSON	and the English influence of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	-- not always to wholesome effect , we regret to say .

		One of the poems , at least , carries the expression of sensualism beyond what is permissible , and others are morbid in tendency .

		But we repeat that the work is remarkable , and promises much for its author 's future .

		XOTES .

		A new and revised edition of the old morality play , ` The Life and Repentaunce of
Marie Magda	PERSON	- lene , ' edited by Prof.
Frederic Ives Carpenter	PERSON	, is announced by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems that the late
Augustus C. Buell	PERSON	, at the time of his death last
summer	DATE	, had just completed an elaborate biography of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, and the work will be published by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	during the coming month .

		A new edition of `
Barnes	PERSON	' Popular History of the
United States	LOCATION	, ' revised to date , and including illustrations of the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	and the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Purchase Exposition , has been prepared by
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An edition for school use , of
Tocqueville	ORGANIZATION	's `
L'Ancien Regime	ORGANIZATION	, ' is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Mr.
G. W. Headlam	PERSON	is the editor , supply - ing an English introduction and notes to the French text and notes of the author .

		An illustrated edition of ` The Maiden and Mar - ried Life of
Mary Powell	PERSON	' and `
Deborah	PERSON	's Diary , ' with an introduction by the Rev.
W. H. Hutton	PERSON	and drawings by Messrs.
John Jellicoe	PERSON	and Her -
bert Railton	PERSON	, is among the recent importations of the Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		` British Poets of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	' is the title of a work , to be published at once by Messrs.
Benj	PERSON	.


H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, designed to sup - ply in a single volume all the material required by students in school courses devoted to English poetry of the nineteenth century .

		A new and enlarged edition of `
The Study of Henry Esmond	ORGANIZATION	, ' designed as an aid to the proper appreciation of
Thackeray	PERSON	's novel , has just ap - peared in the ` Study-Guide Series , ' prepared and published by
H. A. Davidson	PERSON	.

		This useful series will be issued from
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in the future , instead of from
Albany	LOCATION	as heretofore .

		The
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	issues ` The Constitutions and Other Select Documents Illustrative of the History of
France	LOCATION	, 1789-1901 , ' as chosen and trans - lated by Professor
Frank Maloy Anderson	PERSON	. ''

		The selection is comprehensive , filling over six hundred pages , and will be found of great usefulness by students of modern history and political science .

		`
Japan	LOCATION	Described by
Great Writers	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a compilation recently made by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	.

		It deals with the various aspects of the country ; its physical features ; its customs and industries .

		The selections are inter - esting and the book as a whole fiirnishes one with an easy and convenient means of learning what
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	, and other writei-s of lesser note have had to say about
Japan	LOCATION	.

		` The New Star Chamber and Other Essays , ' by Mr.
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	, is sent us by the
Hammersmark Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a collection of forcibly written essays upon political subjects , containing much sound doctrine upon imperialism and the dangerous i > resent centralizing trend in our government .

		We regret that the effect of this excellent writing should be marred by the exces - sive radicalism evoked by other subjects , and by an occasional intemperance of statement .

		Following the recent assignment of the
Lothrop Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	comes the announcement that the entire assets and good-will of this corporation have been purchased by
Messrs. Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	, and that the business of the two houses will be combined under the title of
The Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	, liee
& Shepard Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The affairs of the new cor - poration will be under the direction of Mr.
Wdr	PERSON	- 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ren
F. Gregory	PERSON	, for the past six years manager for
Messrs. Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two houses concerned iu this amalgamation have always made a distinct speciality of books for the young , and their com - bined resources will now give them the strongest list of juvenile literature offered by any house in the trade .

		Lovers of the Brownings and of
Italy	LOCATION	will hardly fail to welcome the forthcoming volume entitled `
Florence	LOCATION	in the Poetry of the Brownings , ' in which Mrs.
Anna B. McMahan	PERSON	has brought together the poems of Mr. and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	having to do with the art and history of
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Numerous illustrations from photographs and an introduction by the compiler are included in the volume , which will be published early next month by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two volumes of considerable interest to students of American literature are included in Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's
Autumn	DATE	list .

		One of the two is a biog - raphical , critical ^ and illustrative treatment of the ` Literary Leaders of
America	LOCATION	, ' prepared by Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	.

		The other is a ` History of American Literature , ' by Prof.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	and Mr.
C. N. Greenough	PERSON	, -- a revised and abridged
Hdaptation	PERSON	, for the use of high schools and col - leges , of Prof.
Wendell	PERSON	's well-known
` Literary History of America	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The prevailing interest in American historical sources finds new expression in a series projected by the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the editorship of Mr.
Kufus Eoekwell Wilson	PERSON	, to comprise annotated reprints of the most valuable and interesting items of rare Americana .

		The first three volumes , now nearly ready , consist of
Andrew Burnaby	PERSON	's i ' Travels through the Middle Settlements of
North America	LOCATION	, 1759-1760 , '
William Heath	PERSON	's ` Memoirs of the American War , ' and a revised and enlarged edition of
W. W. Canfield	PERSON	's ` Legends of the
Iro	PERSON	- quois . '

		The volumes will include so far as possible fac-similes of the original illustrations and maps , and will be issued at a moderate price .

		The
Thirteenth International Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be held in
Boston	LOCATION
the first week of October	DATE	.

		Judg - ing from the preliminary announcements already made , the gathering will be one of exceptional importance .

		The foreign delegates certainly form a distinguished company , including , among many others , such eminent persons as Sir
John Macdonell	PERSON	, Mr.
Gustave Hubbard	PERSON	,
M. Charles Wagner	PERSON	, Count
Albert Apponyi	PERSON	, the Bishops of
Hereford	ORGANIZATION	and
Ripon	LOCATION	, Mr.
W. R. Cremer	PERSON	, Professor Quidde ,
M. Emile Arnaud	PERSON	, Professor
Langlois	PERSON	, Dr.
Adolph Richter	PERSON	, and the
Baroness von Suttner	PERSON	.

		Among the dis - tinguished Americans who will take part in the pro- gramme are Messrs.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	,
John Hay	PERSON	, and
Oscar C. Straus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Reduced rates are offered by nearly all the railways .

		The ` Letters from an
American Farmer	ORGANIZATION	' which was published in
London	LOCATION	more than a century ago by
J. Hector St.	ORGANIZATION	.


John Crevecoeur	PERSON	, has been , if not exactly a forgotten book , at least an unduly neg - lected one .

		The work certainly deserves the resus - citation that has now been given it by
Messrs. Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have made a handsome reprint of the original
London	LOCATION	edition .

		Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, in his ` American Literature , ' first revived our interest in this book , and he now writes an introduction for the edition , which has other - wise been prepared by Mr.
Ludwig Lewinsohn	PERSON	.

		The editor has also done what he could to recon - struct the life of the author , but the facts pre - served concerning him make only a meagre show - ing .

		There is an appendix of letters written by and about him to no less a personage than
Ben	PERSON	- jamin
Franklin	PERSON	.

		AXNOUNCEMEXTS OF FALI .

		BOOKS .

		Herewith is presented The Dial 's list of books announced for publication this Fall , -- as usual the earliest comprehensive and classified information - given to the public regarding the important forth - coming books of the present season .

		Entry is here made of more than twelve hundred titles , repre - senting the season 's output of sixty leading Amer - ican publishers .

		The list has been prepared from advance information secured especially for this purpose .

		All the books entered are presumably new books -- new editions not being included un - less having new form or matter ; and , with a few necessary exceptions , the list does not include Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

		While no attempt has been made to include titles as titles merely , regardless of their significance or interest to our readers , yet it is believed that no really important book is missing from this list .

		Some of the more interest - ing features of the list are commented on in the leading editorial in this issue of The Dial .

		PRESS COMMENTS This is the moat substantial and valuable work on its sub - ject yet produced in our country .

		Scholarly , scientific , thor - ough , it is an inductive study of the first importance to every student of the primary social question -- the question of the famUy .

		-- The Outlook .

		In the three volumes which constitute this monumental work the learned author has provided the first adequate treat - ment of the history of human marriage ... The volumes bear on every page the marks of wide and painstaking scholar - ship .

		--
Quarterly Journal of Economics	ORGANIZATION	.

		The general reader will peruse the text with sustained interest ; he will experience little difficulty in following the author 's argument or in appreciating the force and significance of his conclusions .

		The scholar will find in the numerous footnotes , the extensive bibliography , and the carefully exe - cuted index , many additional points of excellence .

		-- The Dial .

		There can be no broader or more complex subject for liter - ary discussion than the development of the human institution called the family .

		Innumerable are the problems presented .

		From the remote past the topic bristles with difficulties .

		The laws relating to marriage and divorce are most complex .

		The author of '' A History of Matrimonial Institutions , '' who has thus imposed on himself a stupendous task , has certainly accomplished his work in a satisfactory manner .

		-- The
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	's elaborate study of matrimonial institutions and legislation affecting alike the binding and the dissolution of the tie is probably the most important work that has appeared on this subject in
America	LOCATION	.

		-- The Churchman ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		These volumes must ' .

		ong be considered both as authorita - tive in statement and as a stimulus to future monographs ... Professor
Howard	PERSON	has accomplished his task in philosophical and historical spirit ; with a clearness of statement that inspires confidence and respect ; with the controlled enthusiasm of one that is master of his subject and not mastered by it .

		The work , as a vast storehouse of well arranged facts , is an honor to American scholarship .

		--
Boston Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		No student of matrimonial institutions can afford to over - look this work .

		The amount of learning condensed in Dr.
Howard	PERSON	's three volumes is enormous .

		The bibliographical index alone occupies about 140 pages and the author 's foot - notes furnish conclusive proof that the innumerable authorities have been not only consulted but thoroughly examined .

		The task must have exacted the assiduous labor of many years .

		BRIEFER MENTION 215 NOTES 215 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 216 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 216 A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITERATURE .

		I .

		As in previous years , we publish , in this and the following number of The Dial a summary of the series of special articles on the Continen - tal literature of the past twelvemonth contrib - uted to ' The Athenaeum ' by various writers .

		Our English contemporary has chosen to post - pone the publication of these articles from its first
July	DATE	issue to its first
September	DATE	issue , which makes possible a more nearly complete survey of the annual product , and also accounts for the belated appearance of our own summa - ries .

		The condensations which follow are from Professor Fredericq writing for
Belgium	LOCATION	, Dr.
Tille	PERSON	for
Bohemia	LOCATION	, Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	for
Denmark	LOCATION	,
M. Pravieux	PERSON	for
France	LOCATION	, and Dr.
Heilbom	PERSON	for
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Belgian literature , as is well known , comes in both the French and the Flemish languages ; and Professor Fredericq reports important works of both kinds .

		In the drama , Mr.
Eafael Verhulst	PERSON	's ' Jesus de
Nazarener	PERSON	' and ' Reinaert de Vos ' are of the first interest , the former of these plays bringing ' the Gospel story before us with a devoutness of feeling and a respect for the great personality of Christ which makes us almost forget the audacity of the author . ' '

		A Pastor , ' by Mr.
Jan Bruylants	PERSON	, ' paints the ideal portrait of a Catholic priest in a Flemish village , who refuses to soil his robe in the mire of political dissension and opens his arms to the repentent sinner . '

		`
Rina	PERSON	, ' by Mr.
Lodewijk Scheltjens	PERSON	, the dramatist of the proletariat , is called ' one of the most powerful works which have been put on the Flemish stage in our time . '

		Among books of French verse , we note the veteran
M. E. Picard	PERSON	's '
Ainsi Nait	ORGANIZATION	, Vit , Meurt I ` ximour ' and
M. E. Verhaeren	PERSON	's ' Les Tendresses Premieres . '

		In fiction , the first book to be mentioned is ' Les Cadets de
Brabant	LOCATION	, ' by
M. Leopold Courouble	PERSON	, the creator of the Kake - broek family .

		The best of the year 's fiction is Flemish , and includes the following works . '

		The Burgomaster of x ^ ntwerp , ' by Mr.
Pol de Mont	PERSON	, ` is the story of a legendary Bluebeard who wished successively to murder his seven wives . '

		` The Tranquil Constellation , ' by Mr ,
Herman Teirlinck	PERSON	, is ' a sing-ularly penetrating picture of the life and sentiments of the down - trodden peasants of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Mr.
Stijn	PERSON	196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Streuvels , in ^ Village Love / has produced his first long novel , ' a work full of supple strength and picturesque realism / Mr.
Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	's ' After Marriage ' ' probes the inmost heart of a young husband .

		A gifted painter , wealthy and artistic , he has married a woman who does not understand him , and who deceives him in the most vulgar manner possible . '

		Miss
Virginie Loveling	PERSON	, ' for many years at the head of
Flem	PERSON	- ish literature in
Belgium	LOCATION	, ' has written * The Apple of Discord , ' a deeply original work which describes ' the struggle , so frequent in
Flanders	LOCATION	, between a free-thinking father and a mother rigidly determined on the moral and religious education of their child . '

		Works of history , biography , and social science are numerous , but none of them seem to be of a nature to attract much attention outside of the country in which they have been written .

		Dr.
V. Tille	PERSON	, - ^ vriting of Bohemian letters , tells us that ` an ever-growing endeavour after a modern national novel and a raising of the drama , be it on liistorical or social basis , stands in the foreground . '

		The most important attempts to produce a modem national novel are Mr.
Simacek	PERSON	's ' Hungry Hearts ' and Mr.
Sova	PERSON	's ' Expeditions of the Poor . '

		The new drama is illustrated by ' Princes , ' a tragedy of the Bohemian middle ages , the work of Mr.
Vrchlieky	PERSON	, the foremost Bohemian poet .

		It ' represents in strong lines the horrors of fratri - cidal strife for a throne . '

		Another drama of high rank is Mr.
Kvapil	PERSON	's ' Clouds / which ' rep - resents a young Eoman Catholic theologian who falls in love with a famous actress , his play - mate in childliood 's years . '

		In verse , Mr.
Maehar	PERSON	'' has made a , new sensation ' by four Iwoks of sonnets on the seasons , ' in which he treats a great variety of subjects in his original and sharply-pointed style , ' while Vide circles of readers have been interested by Mr.
F. X. Prochaska	PERSON	's '' Songs of Hradcany / ' which have gone through several editions . '

		Tlie new femin - ism is making its influence felt in Bohemian literature , and women figure conspicuously every year among the writers of fiction , poetiy , and the drama .

		Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	's review of Danish litera - ture has to do duty this year for the whole of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, since reporte from both
Norway	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	are missing .

		He notes the para - doxical fact that ` though the purchasers of books are getting fewer , the number of those who write them is constantly growing . '

		Every man his own author would seem to be the motto of literary aspirants in
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		Two novels of the year are entitled ' Babel ' -LRB- Babylon -RRB- , and clearly result from the recent achieve - ments of Oriental archasolog -RCB- ' .

		One of them , by
Herr Carl Kohl	PERSON	, is ` only a mass of dead fact ^ and dead bones , ' but the other , by Mr.
Niels Hoffmeyer	PERSON	, is described as ' a most note - worthy human document , ' suggested possibly by Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's '
Quo Vadis	PERSON	, ' but ' a bet - ter book , more harmonious and powerful in its construction . '

		Another historical novel of inte - rest is '
Lasse Maansson	PERSON	, ' by
Herr P. F. Eist	PERSON	, which tells of the Swedish invasion of Den - mark in the seventeenth century . '

		It is the story of
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	again , but dressed in other garments and speaking another lan - guage . '

		Important novels of modern life are ' Den Store Eros , ' by
Herr Svend Leopold	PERSON	, and '
Sidste Kamp	PERSON	, ' by
Herr Otto Rungs	PERSON	.

		The latter ' has undertaken the task of showing the extermination of the aristocracy in our demo - cratic time . '

		The life of the peasantry is illus - trated by ' Sind , ' a tragic tale by a young cler - gyman ,
Herr Jacob Knudsen	PERSON	, and the relig - ious novel by ' Helligt ^ gteskab , a plea for a sort of free love by
Miss Ingeborg Maria Sick	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among works of scholarship .

		Professor Wim - raer 's book on the runic monuments of Den - mark , now nearly completed , is of great value .

		Professor Hoffding 's ` Modem Philosophers , ' which deals with Wundt ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, and other thinkers of our own time , and is a sequel to his fascinating ` History of Modern Philosophy , ' will probably very soon find its way into the hands of English readers .

		The writer of the French survey is , as for several years past ,
M. Jules Pravieux	PERSON	, who says : ' At the outset of this review of the literary year , I have again to note the variety of works and talent to be dealt with .

		It is no longer the age of a well-disciplined , well-ordered literature preserved by foreseeing regulations from the perils of indi - vidualism .

		Several French writers do not cease to deplore the fact , which must be again recorded , that we have no new school to replace the old .

		There are as many schools as artists .

		Should we regret it ?

		Not so much as some would wish to do .

		All schools , like all systems , are necessarily restrictive .

		Our literature needs neither a new school nor a new formula .

		It needs nothing but original and genuine talent , and that this is not lacking in
France	LOCATION	at the present moment this rapid review of the literary movement will sufficiently prove . '

		The drama naturally occupies the first place , and the number of plays characterized is con - siderable , although only a small fraction of the thousand or more which , according to
M. Clare	PERSON	- tie , are annually submitted to the Theatre Fran - cais .

		We have space to mention a few only .

		MM .

		Lavedan and
Lenotre	PERSON	, in ` Yarennes / have dealt with the episode of the flight and cap - ture of
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		MM .

		de Caillavet , de
Flers	ORGANIZATION	, and
Jeoffrin	PERSON	, in ' La Montansier , ' have told the story of a famous actress of a hundred years ago . ''

		M.
Paul Hervieu	PERSON	in ` Le Dedale , ' has exploited the idea of ` the eternal vassalage of woman ' in a melodramatic manner .

		M. Mau - rice

		THE DIAIi 197 ' Tries to prove that there exists between the Jew - ish and the Aryan races so ingrained a discord , such a profound divergence of ideas and of sentiments , that the union of two beings belonging to these dissimilar races is doomed to unhappiness , and leads by an inevitable descent to rupture , if not hate , so that all fusion between them is chimerical and detri - mental .

Terence	PERSON	did with
Menander	PERSON	' ; that is , he has made a single lengthy work , by selec - tion and combination , out of the Shakespearian material .

		It is interesting to learn that
M. Pinero	PERSON	's ` The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray	PERSON	' has had a well-deserved success on the Parisian stage .

		The ' poets in
France	LOCATION	are not moribund either from poverty or exhaustion , ' as is attested by the annual production of six hundred or more volumes of new verse .

		Those of the past year include ` Lueurs et Flammes , ' by Mile .

		Vacaresco ; ` Les Visions Sinceres / by
M. Jacques Normand	PERSON	; ' Les Roses de Laurier , ' by
M. Clovis Hugues	PERSON	; ' La Cite des Eaux , ' by

Heures Lointaines	PERSON	, ' by
M. Paul Harel	PERSON	; ' L'Axchange des Batailles , ' by
M. Gaston Armelin	PERSON	; and ' Terre Divine , ' by
M. Gustav Zidler	PERSON	.

		It is difficult , as
M. Pravieux	PERSON	suggests , to make a judicious choice from the immense output of the year 's fiction .

		M. de
Vogue	ORGANIZATION	' Le Maitre de la Mer ' is a novel that ' brings forward one of the most vital questions of modern life -- the conflict between two forces , militarism and patrit ^ tism on the one hand , ever demanding fresh worlds to conquer , so that the national flag may be planted there - on ; on the other the exclusively practical spirit , which trades with gold rather than sentiments . '

		The MM .

		Margueritte in their ' La Commune , bring to an end their series of novels upon the War of
1870	DATE	and its consequences .

		M. Fer - nand
Dacre	PERSON	has woven into the web of ' La Race ' a ` condensed and triumphant criticism of international theories . '

		In ' Le Vertige Passionnel , ' by
M. Rene Fath	PERSON	, we have ' a story of strong passions , in which , by means of a series of very bold situations , the reader is led up to a climax of somewhat mixed moral - ity . '

		A few ather novels are ` La Peur de Vivre , ' by
M. Henry	ORGANIZATION
Bordeaux	LOCATION	; '
Bon Plaisir	LOCATION	, ' by
M. de Regnier	PERSON	; ' Portraits d' A'ieules , ' by
M. Andre Lichtenberger	PERSON	; and ' Trois Dots , ' by M. d'Azambuja .

		It is evident , concludes the writer , ' That of all classes of French literature to-day fiction is the most prolific .

		But at this point the public begins to manifest some signs of satiety , and turns with a curiosity which increases every year towards historical works , memoirs , and autobiogra - phies .

		All such writings are eagerly welcomed , and must indeed be mediocre to obtain no success .

		Yes ; it almost seems as though the public were weary of fiction , and appreciated the certainty of truth which these narratives and descriptions offer .

		It seems , also , that the aesthetic education of the public has reached such a pitch that it can now extract for itself whatever possibilities of literary pleasure the raw material may contain , and that it prefers to do such work rather than receive it ready-made from a skilled artist .

		And however small the har - vest , the effort made , as well as the result attained , gives satisfaction . '

		Historical works of the year include M. Mas - son 's ` IS ` apoleon et Son Fils , '
M. Stenger	PERSON	's ` La Societe Frangaise pendant le Consulat , ' and
Cardinal Mathieu	ORGANIZATION	's ' Le Concordat de
1801	DATE	. '

		In literary criticism there is
M. Brune	PERSON	- tiere 's ' Cinq Lettres sur
Ernest Renan	PERSON	, ' reac - tionary , of course , but a masterly example of controversial writing ;
M. F. Loliee	PERSON	's ' Histoire des Litteratures Compaxees ' ;
M. E. Schure	PERSON	's ' Precurseurs et Revoltes , ' dealing with
Shelley	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and others ; and
M. F. Veuillot	PERSON	's ' Les Predicateurs de la Scene , ' which ' studies from the moral standpoint the trend of modern thought as depicted in the most favourably received modern plays . '

		M. Pravieux concludes his remarks by saying : ' If in this review of the Literary production of the year I look for any general movement , I notice nearly everywhere -- in fiction , the drama , and in other branches of intellectual activity -- a very marked tendency towards the study of social problems .

		Literature is influenced by the revival which seems to be affecting the social , moral , and political world . '

		Dr.
Ernest Heilborn	PERSON	, discoursing of things German , begins by saying that the great stage successes of the year have been , not new pro- ductions , but the '
Gotz	PERSON	' of Goethe and the '
Minna von Barnhelm	PERSON	' of
Lessing	PERSON	.

		The most significant of the new plays have been those which have ' attempted to solve the problem of life with a special view to the artist , or at least to the artistic temperament . '


Herr Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	has treated of this problem in '
Der Einsame Weg	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Herr von
Hoffmansthal	ORGANIZATION	's '
Electra	PERSON	' is a Sophoclean drama which makes us ' feel what a contrast there is between the feeble , sickly sentiment of our moderns and the strength and purity of the ancients . '

		In his ` Stella und
Antonie	PERSON	, '
Herr Bierbaum	PERSON	` has turned to the poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , listened to its music , and revived its graceful , lyrical atmosphere . '

		In
Herr Frank Wedekind	ORGANIZATION	's ' So 1st das Leben , ' a fanciful mixture of farce and tragedy , ' roman - ticism , with its audacious irony and its delight in popular song , comes to life once more . '

Bologna	LOCATION	, the question of woman 's emancipa - tion .

		* Der
Meister	PERSON	, ' by
Herr Hermann Bahr	PERSON	, has adultery for its theme , and for its hero a complacent piece of self-portraiture .

		Finally , the new comedy of
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	, entitled ' Der Sturmgeselle Sokrates , ' presents the lib - eral revolutionary feeling of
1848	DATE	as it survives in this later generation , and the inevitable con - flict which it entails between fathers and sons .

		The play is described as both tedious and unsuc - cesful .

		The following comment upon the pres - ent condition of the stage is highly significant : ' If the real merit of the revolt in the early nineties consisted mainly in the fact that the stage was once more opened to works of serious literature which made no concessions to popular taste , and that it brought all superficial and sensational meth - ods into disrepute , assuredly some of the whilom leaders in that struggle have long since returned to a calculated and unscrupulous stagecraft .

		They worship to-day the idols that they burnt ten years ago . '

		The greatest fictional success of the year is reported to have been achieved by the anony - mous ' Briefe , Die Ihn nicht Erreichten , ' which has already appeared in English .


Herr Wil	PERSON	- helm

Cambridge	LOCATION	I With what ease and grace could the great scholar and linguist illuminate , from the resources of comparative philology and a range of reading tbat seemed literally boundless , even the most commonplace as well as the most puzzling passages in his old friend 's favorite ' Don ' !

		As characteristic of the bom teacher and linguist , take this one sentence from his early letters to his betrothed , fourteen years and more his senior , to whom he was giving Sanskrit lessons by mail , -- '

		He was then not yet twenty years old , his lady love thirty - four .

		No wonder his schoolmates at first thought he had succumbed to an unwarranted attack on his liberty ; but all prejudice was straightway overcome as soon as they made the acquaintance of
Elizabeth Charlesworth	PERSON	, whose bright intelligence and high ideals made her universally admired , and whose warm sympathy with all her young husband 's aspirations and cordial interest in his friends could not but win the latter 's hearty liking .

		That she exerted no little influence in shaping
Cowell	ORGANIZATION	's career and in bringing him the honors that crowned his .

		The discouragements
Cowell	ORGANIZATION	had to contend against in youth were not light .

		His father , an Ipswich merchant , died when
Edward	PERSON	was only sixteen , making it necessary for him , as the eldest of the six children , to leave school and assume control of the business .

		Eight years of bondage to ' the desk 's dead wood ' followed , until the next brother was able to mount the office stool and relieve him .

		Yet with an uncomplaining industry that would have put
Charles Lamb	PERSON	to the blush , he accom - plished in that time a really prodigious amount of reading and study and writing ; so that when , at the age of twenty-four , he yielded to the urgent solicitations of his wife and of his * Life and

Kitchin	PERSON	, and presented himself for matriculation at
Oxford	LOCATION	, he must have pos - sessed ' a stock of erudition that might have puzzled a doctor / but without the correspond - ing ' degree of ignorance of which a schoolboy might have been ashamed / The fact alone that he had , almost unassisted , gained a good knowl - edge of Sanskrit , will attest his extraordinary power of application .

		To enumerate the other languages , ancient and modern , that he had also mastered , in a literary way , would require too much space ; and the books in those tongues which he had not only read but critically stud - ied , as evidenced by his early magazine articles and reviews , are fairly bewildering in their range and number .

		His biographer has good reason to call him a ' gourmand ' in reading ; hut , what the gourmand too often fails to do , he digested and assimilated all that he read , showing powers of memory and quickness of insight that are truly remarkable .

		The remaining principal events in his life may here be briefly given , after which a few quotations , chiefly from his letters , will serve to illustrate what manner of man he was .

		His biographer , Mr.
Greorge Cowell	PERSON	, is his cousiin .

		and writes with all the sympathy and apprecia - tion of an admiring kinsman .

		It was in the
summer of 1856	DATE	, as he tells us , that
Cowell	PERSON	, at the age of thirty , sailed with his wife for
India	LOCATION	to assume the professorship of English history and political economy at the Presidency Col - lege ,
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		There he remained seven and a half years , teaching not only his assigned subjects , but also various other branches as need arose , and , after a few years , undertaking in addition the principalship of the
Sanskrit College	ORGANIZATION	and infusing new life into that school .

		Reading and writing meanwhile went on unin - terruptedly , and soon it was found that he could give points in Sanskrit even to the Pundits , although of course as specialists in separate branches -RRB- of Sanskrit lore they were his superiors .

		The inevitable effect of climate compelled his return to
England	LOCATION	before he had intended ; and three years later came his tri - umphant election to the newly established Cam - bridge professorship of Sanskrit which he held until his death in
1903	DATE	.

		Going back now to that remarkable series of letters -- one can hardly call them love let - ters -- which he wrote to
Miss Charlesworth	LOCATION	, we chance on a characteristic bit in connection with the pronunciation of the Sanskrit labials . '

		It reminds me of years and years ago , when I was a little boy at school , and when I used to be very naughty and talk in school hours , and I found out that the master could never see me talking unless when I pronounced these very labial letters , and therefore I used to avoid them in conversa - tion to my neighbors , lest my lips should move and betray me . '

		A later letter to his friend
Kitchin	PERSON	-- the present Dean of
Durham	LOCATION	, it will be understood * -- gives a pleasing glimpse of the young schol - ar '' s hopes and aspirations . '

		I have the pleasure to tell ' you that that paper on '' Homer and Firdusi '' which I wrote while you were staying with me was published in the Gentlemen '' s Magazine this month , and this morn - ing I received a postoffice order for it .

		... I am going everv now and then to send them papers about Oriental subjects .

		This will give an addi - tional vigor to my Oriental studies , and I hope to ?

		ush them on with some hopes of success .

		When know Sanscrit , which , you know , is a field that has not been made commonplace or trite , I hope to bring my acquaintance with Greek and Latin and Persian to bear upon that as a focus , and I hope to trace out the influence of the Oreek mind upon the Hindu mind through
Alexander	PERSON	's conquests and colonies .

		There is great connection between the two languages , and I expect there is equally a connection between the habits of thought and the ideas themselves of the two nations . '

		Here the ardent scholar is fax more in evi - dence than the practised writer , as the reader will have noted .

		The part of CowelFs life that seems to have given him most pleasure in the living , and most satisfaction in the retrospect , was his term of service in
India	LOCATION	.

		As the cli - mate made sedentary pursuits a necessity , he - adapted himself to conditions and accomplishedif an enormous amount of reading , editing , and ' writing , besides his teaching .

		The compara - tive coolness of the early morning he devotedl to literary occupation .

		At half-past five we see him seated on his board verandah , where he read and wrote for three hours before brealring his fast .

		Indeed , many a time he was too deeply engrossed to note the coming of his morning cutlet , and one of the crows that abound in
Calcutta	LOCATION	would often swoop down and carry off his breakfast .

		From a letter home we take the following : ' We were amused at one part of your last let - ter , which mentioned Indian luxuries , and when you expressed some fear as to how we should rel - ish plain English fare after the delicacies of the tropics .

		The fact is
India	LOCATION	has no luxuries or deli - cacies , -- the finest Indian things are inferior to third rate things in
England	LOCATION	.

		There is nothing good in
India	LOCATION	which is not very inferior and five times , ten times dearer than the corresponding thing in
England	LOCATION	.

		We live almost entirely on legs of mutton , chickens , ducks and eggs ; and none of them is to be compared in size or flavor with those in
England	LOCATION	.

		I never touch any of the preserves .

		Guava is the best and it is very beautiful to look at , but I ca n't bear its excessive sweetness .

		Then all the fruit -LRB- as I read in
Hooker	LOCATION	's Himalayas before I came out -RRB- is very insipid and poor ; and it is not very wholesome either .

		I generally keep to plantains , which are like a very poor pear , grafted on a potato .

		The only luxury in
India	LOCATION	is the Pundit , and that you ca n't get in
England	LOCATION	.

		No one who has any knowledge of Professor 200 THE DIAL .

Oct. 1	DATE	,
Cowell	ORGANIZATION	's extreme modesty will be surprised that he protested against the publication of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's encomiums in the ' Letters ' edited by Mr.
W. Aldis Wright	PERSON	.

		He declared that he was not learned ' in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	sense , although he was forced to admit that he had read widely .

		Akin to this insistence on a mod - est estimate of himself was his conscientious - ness in even the smallest particulars .

		A niece of Mrs.
Cowell	PERSON	gives this illustration : ' An instance occurs to me in connection with his correspondence with one of the old Indian Pundits with whom he had studied in
India	LOCATION	.

		I noticed that in despatching a letter to him he had a special method of moistening the envelope from a saucer of water .

		On my asking the reason , he explained that a Brahman would consider it defilement to touch an envelope that had been moistened with the tongue . ''

		But would he feel safe , '' I asked , '' in your case from the possibility of your doing things in the usual way ? ''

		The reply was , '' He has my word for it . '' '

		That
Cowell	ORGANIZATION	's name is to-day almost unknown to the great reading public is less to be wondered at when we remember that literary aspirations soon became secondary with him .

		It was in keeping with the unaffected piety of Ms nature that he grew to be more interested in his occupation of enlightening young minds , in taking part in missionary work , and in mak - ing himself , as he expressed it , ' an instrument rmder God for doing some good . '

		Thus it is that we find more to charm in one letter of that delightful old pagan FitzGerald than in all his erudite friend 's scholarly writings .

		A number of these letters are now first published , and are welcome additions to the volume , although they contain nothing of extraordinary interest .

		What the two correspondents and devoted friends had pre-eminently in common was the quality of self-effacement .

		Each proved his greatness by never knowing that he excelled .

		The editor 's task has been no light one , and it has been very satisfactorily executed .

		Such minor errors as the book contains are too few and too unimportant to call for individual men - tion .

		Two good portraits of
Cowell	ORGANIZATION	add greatly to the value of the work , and the reader only regrets that Mrs.
Cowell	PERSON	's likeness is not also given , as she was no less remarkable in her way than he in his .

		A half - dozen articles by various writers , numerous fac - isimile letters , and a profusion of fine illustrations in photogravure , color , and half-tone , serve to present a most illuminating record of each section of the

		Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	is the editor of the vol - The Cult of Matthe ^ v
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		* If
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	had foreseen the way in which his wish to be known to posterity through his writings , and not through biogra - phies , would affect his future reputation , he might easily have avoided all the fighting to which his disciples are now forced in his defense .

		Few writers have been so beloved and appreciated by the literary men of their own time .

		Their regard was a continual source of wonder , even to him . '

		Swinburne fairly took my breath away , ' he writes . '

		I must say the general public praise me in the dubious style in which old
Wordsworth	PERSON	used to praise Ber - nard
Barton	PERSON	,
James Montgomery	PERSON	, and such - like ; and the writers of poetry , on the other hand , --
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Lytton	LOCATION	, -- praise me as the general public praises its favorites .

		This is a curious reversal of the usual order of things . '

		Under such circum - stances , it was only his expressed desire to the contrary which kept his friends among the large-souled men who were able to appreciate him from using their pens to write his praises .

		Some of his lefters , with most of his loving good-nature and brilliant raillery ` blue pen - cilled ' as too personal , were published in
1895	DATE	, and with them the storm broke .

		All the little men of letters , the whole tribe of Pennyalinus , were upon Mm in full force , scoffing at his poetry , arguing against his politics , shouting and screaming against his theology .

		Until a year or two ago , however , their work was val - ued at its just worth , and might have remained unnoticed had not so well-known a critic as Mr.
Herbert W. Paul	PERSON	departed from his usual just and temperate tone and written a biography of Arnold which is not a criticism but a censorship ; which quotes every poor line the poet ever wrote , and barely notes his best work ; which is calculated to produce an impres - sion of its subject paralleled only by
Mark Antony	PERSON	's oration , and leaves the reader thank - ful that it is Arnold and not
Browning	PERSON	who is being judged by his poorest work .

		Immedi - ately
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's admirers felt themselves bound to take up the cudgel in his behalf ; but their best efforts are weakened by the fact that their position is one of defense , and must remain so for some time to come .

		To do
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	justice it will require that some one who is not an Englishman , some one whose perspective is large enough to include th e universal appli - *

		THE DIAL 201 cation of
Arnold	LOCATION	's philosophy , should see his religion apart from his theology and its rela - tion to establishment and nonconformity , to decide disinterestedly whether his liberalism was conservative or radical , and above all to enjoy his humor without feeling the thrusts from his penetrating shafts .

		As far as it is possible for Englishmen to rate him correctly , however , it has been done by Mr.
William Harbutt Dawson	PERSON	in his ' Mat - thew
Arnold	PERSON	and his Relation to the Thought of Our Time , ' and by Mr.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	in his life of Arnold recently published in
Scrib	LOCATION	- ner 's series of ' Literary Lives . '

		Neither book is a biography , in the full sense of being a his - tory , an estimate , and an analysis .

		Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell 's book , which is a survey of the effect that Arnold produced by his writings and a study of his method , serves as a good supplement to Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's statement of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's philoso - phy , which he prefaces as follows : ' There is to-day a cult of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; it is growing ; it must grow .

		It will grow because many tendencies of the age are in its favor ; still more because many influences are opposed to it , and because the healthiest instincts of human nature and the deepest interests of civilization require that it shall combat these opposing influences and overcome them .

		The cult of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	is the cult of idealism , using the word not , of course , in its philosophical sense , but as indicating the pur - suit of perfection as the worthiest working prin - ciple of life . '

		It is this pursuit of universal perfection that
Arnold	LOCATION	stands for most definitely .

		It is the preaching of this doctrine that led the prac - tical men of his age to call him unscientific , a dreamer , unaware of the great strong current of individualism which controlled English life .

		And so slowly have the forces of civilization worked that even to-day , when all economists admit the natural evolution from ' involuntary social cooperation to voluntary social coopera - tion , ' when the laissez-faire theory is as dead as the men who fostered it , the mass of men will not see that
Arnold	LOCATION	was right when he claimed that it was not progress , but lack of progress , which dictated the worship of mate - rial advancement .

		` Your middle class man thinks it the highest pitch of development and civilization when his letters are carried twelve times a day from
Islington	LOCATION	to
Camberwell	ORGANIZATION	, and from
Camberwell	ORGANIZATION	to
Islington	LOCATION	, and if railway trains run to and fro between them every quar - ter of an hour .

		He thinks it is nothing that trains only carry him from an illiberal , dismal life at
Islington	LOCATION	to an illiberal , dismal life at
Camberwell	LOCATION	; and the letters only tell him that such is the life there . '

		If
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was sometimes unjust to the men of science , if , in his devotion to his cause and his love for the ` grand old fortify - ing classical curriculum , ' he was inclined to give undue prominence to the humanities in the scheme of education , -- it was not because he was narrow-minded , but because he saw clearly that while beauty and truth and color were without , away from the self of a man , happiness and love and understanding and culture must come from within .

		The men of science had become so accustomed to the micro - scope and the magnifying glass that they had lost the use of their inner eyes ; and this to
Arnold	LOCATION	was not only weakness , but wickedness . '

		The only absolute good , the only absolute and eternal object prescribed to us by God 's law , or the divine order of things , is the progress towards perfection , -- our own progress toward it and the progress of humanity .

		Culture has one great pas - sion , the passion for sweetness and light .

		It has one even greater !

		-- the passion for making them PEEVAIL .

		It is not satisfied till we ALL come to a perfect man ; it knows that the sweetness and light of the few must be imperfect until the raw and unkindled masses of humanity are touched with sweetness and light .

		So all our fellow-men , in the East of
London	LOCATION	and elsewhere , we must take along with us in the progress toward perfection , if we ourselves really , as we profess , want to be per - fect ; and we must not let the worship of any fetish , any machinery , such as manufactures or population , -- which are not , like perfection , abso - lute goods in themselves , though we think them so , -- create for us such a multitude of miserable , sunken , and ignorant human beings , that to carry them along is impossible , and perforce they must for the most part be left by us in their degreda - tion and wretchedness . '

		Besides being a splendid piece of writing , and in thought a whole generation in advance of its time , that is practical social economy .

		So is all of ' Culture and Anarchy , ' and in a totally different vein so is that characteris - tically brilliant and satirical series called ' Friendship 's
Garland	LOCATION	. '

		Neither these nor the other of
Arnold	LOCATION	's social or educational writ - ings are open to the criticism of lacking abso - lute present value , of being without the vital principle to work from , which attaches to his religious system .

		Of the fault in the latter , Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	speaks the last word , after having wasted a great deal of time in discussing minor matters of purely theological import .

		* As an ethical system , it is in theory admirable ; but its positive value is in the highest degree ques - tionable .

		Pascal 's judgment upon the God who emerged from the philosophical investigations of R6n6
Descartes	PERSON	was that He was a God who was unnecessary .

		And one may with even greater truth say that the man who is able to receive and live by the religion which Arnold offers him is no longer in need of its help and stimulus .

		To be able to appreciate an ethical idealism , a man must be already an ethical idealist .

		Only by a serious intel - lectual effort can it be apprehended , only by rigor - ous mental discipline can it be appropriated .

		It follows , however , that the one who has succeeded in apprehending and appropriating it needs the inspiration no longer ; while support and consola - tion it is impotent to give .

		The religion that 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, aspires to be universal must meet universal needs ; the religion that would be a religion of mankind must be capable of taking man at his lowest and worst and lifting him into the high places of virtue , of moral and spiritual worth .

		But just because , like all ethical systems ,
Arnold	LOCATION	's religion presup - poses a very high degree both of intellectuality and of rectitude , it , with them , is foredoomed to fail - ure as a universal regenerating force .

		It will fail because it possesses no initial power of edification ; it may preserve , but it can not build up . '

		Whether Arnold 's political writings belong in the class of practical suggestion of reform , or with ^ his religion in that of idealistic theories , we are still too close to decide absolutely ; but the tendency of belief is toward the former .

		In either case , his criticisms of political methods and aims are eminently just and wise .

		In fact , it is always as a critic that Arnold excels .

		He was not naturally a man of action , and his dislike of the exaggerated material strenuous - ness of the age drove him almost to the other extreme .

		He rendered invaluable service to the cause of education during his term as inspector , but even here it is rather through his luminous reports and their critical advice than through any active work in politics ; his active association with any party would prob - ably have been less effective than his persistent pounding away at the evils of the present Eng - lish class-system which has resulted in making ` the upper class materialized , the middle class vulgarized , the lower class brutalized . '

		The very epigrams for which he is famous , and which many critics hold to be a weakness rather than a strength from the purely literary stand - point , have been a political and social force , through their art of reproducing perfectly the idea for which they stand .

		The power of * sweetness and light , ' the contrast between * Hellenism and Hebraism , ' the necessity for * Vigour and rigour , ' the varying dangers to society from ' the Barbarians , the
Philistines	LOCATION	, and the Populace , ' -- he has familiarized us with , them all , and familiarity with an idea is the first step towards embodying it in every - day practice .

		Again , it is as la critic of life that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	has acquired his rank , among the poets .

		That he possessed poetical powers of the first order , no one may well doubt who knows the beautiful lines from
Dover Beach	LOCATION	: ' The sea of faith Was once , too , at the full , and round earth 's shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl 'd .

		But now I only , hear Its melancholy , long , withdrawing roar .

		Retreating , to the breath Of the night-wind , down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world . '

		Ah , love , let us be true To one another !

		for the world , which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams .

		So various , so beautiful , so new .

		Hath really neither joy , nor love , nor light .

		Nor certitude , nor peace , nor help for pain ; And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight .

		Where ignorant armies clash by night . '

		Arnold 's power is , however , not unqualified , and Mr , Eussell seems to have estimated him exactly when he writes : ' He had the poet 's heart and mind , but they did not readily express themselves in the poetic medium .

		He longed for poetic utterance as his only adequate vent , and sought it earnestly with tears .

		Often he achieved it , but not seldom he left the impression of frustrated and disappointing effort , rather than of easy mastery and sure attain - ment .

		Again , if we bear in mind
Milton	LOCATION	's three - fold canon , we must admit that his poetry lacks three great elements of power .

		He is not simple , sensuous , or passionate .

		He is too essentially mod - ern to be really simple .

		He is the product of a high-strung civilization , and all its complicated cross-currents of thought and feeling stir and per - plex his verse .

		He is not sensuous except in so far as the most refined and delicate appreciation of nature in all her forms can be said to constitute a sensuous enjoyment .

		And then , again , he is pre - eminently not passionate .

		He is calm , balanced , self-controlled , sane , austere .

		The very qualities which are his characteristic glory make passion impossible .

		Another hindrance to his title as a great poet is that he is not , and could never be , a poet of the multitude .

		His verse lacks all popular fibre .

		It is the delight of scholars , of philosophers , of men who live by silent introspection or quiet communing with nature .

		But it is altogether remote from the stir and stress of popular life and struggle .

		Then , again , his tone is profoundly , though not morbidly , melancholy , and this is fatal to popularity .

		In brief , it seems to me that he was not a great poet , for he lacked the gifts which sway the multitude and compel the attention of mankind .

		But he was a true poet , rich in those qualities which make the loved and trusted teacher of a chosen few -- as he himself would have said , of the '' Eemnant . '' '

		If the critics are right , -- if , as Mr.
Paul	PERSON	says ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was not a profound thinlcer ; or , as Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	says , he was not a great politician or theologian ; or , as Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	says , he was not a great , poet , -- in what , then , was he great enough to establish and maintain a cult ?

		The question is easily answered : He was , first of all , the great ` apos - tle and exponent of culture ; he was the man above all men in his generation who knew the best that had been said and thought in all ages , who ' saw life steadily and saw it whole . '

		And through this , he was great as a critic and a man of letters .

		Even Mr.
Paul	PERSON	concedes this , '
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's literary criticism , once regarded by young enthusiasts as a revelation , has long since taken a secure place in English letters .

		It is penetrating as well as brilliant , conscientious as well as imaginative .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	may be said to have done for literature what
Euskin	PERSON	did for art .

		He reminded , or informed , the British public that criticism was a serious thing ; that good criticism was just as important as good author - ship ; that it was not a question of individual taste , but partly of received authority , partly of trained judgment .

		Few critics have been so thor -

		Essays in Criticism is one of the indispensable books .

		Not to have read it is to be ignorant of a great intellectual event . '

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	writes of
Arnold	LOCATION	as one who has carefully and earnestly studied his subject , Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	adds to his less pretentious volume the charm of personal association ; and both men have contributed something definite and valuable to the cause they champion .

		And yet , having read the opinion of all the critics on all the various phases of
Arnold	LOCATION	's nature and endeavor , there comes a desire to paraphrase the warning of the Baptist minister w ` ho advised his congregation to spend two hours reading the
Bible	LOCATION	for every hour spent in read - ing
Arnold	LOCATION	, and to advise the reading public to spend two hours in reading Arnold for every half-hour spent in reading about
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		The Seaboard Slave States .

		* In two large well-printed volumes , Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have reissued what is probably the best known of the books of travel in the
South	LOCATION	during the slavery regime -- Olm - sted 's ' Seaboard Slave States . '


Frederick Law Olmsted	ORGANIZATION	was a thorough-going abolitionist of the more sensible type , bom and reared in
New England	LOCATION	, and devoted to
New England	LOCATION	ideals .

		Until he finally discovered his talent as a land - scape gardener , when he was about forty years old , Olmsted had had an easy , amateurish , and , from a worldly point of view , an unsuccessful life .

		He studied engineering , then he travelled , then worked in a dry-goods store , but , not liking that , pursued studies in
Yale	LOCATION	; next he tried a sailor 's life , after which farming claimed his attention for a year or two ; he travelled in
England	LOCATION	, and later in the
Southern States	LOCATION	as newspaper correspondent , and next he became an editor and publisher .

		During the Civil War he was one of the chief promoters of the
Union League	ORGANIZATION	movement in the North , which finally organized the Negro-Republican party of the South .

		The work under review was first published in
1856	DATE	, and was a revision of a series of let - ters written to the
New York	LOCATION	' Times ' during the winter and
spring	DATE	of 1852-3 -LRB- not in
1853	DATE	- 4 , as the title states -RRB- when Olmsted was on a three months ' tour through the South .

		It comprises a description of the internal economy , * A JOUHNEY IN THE SEABOARD SLAVE STATES IN THE Years 1853-1854 .

		With Remarks on their Economy .

		By
Frederick Law Olmsted	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- Originally issued in
1856	DATE	. -RRB-

		With a Biographical Sketch by
Frederick Law Olmsted , Jr.	PERSON	, and an Introduction by
William P. Trent	PERSON	.

		In two vol - umes .

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		as Olmsted saw it , of
Virginia	LOCATION	, the
Carolinas	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	,
Alabama.	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	, together with the author 's views on slavery .

		Southern society , Southern politics , and the economic his - tory of the slave states .

		The author in his travels neglected the great plantation states --
South Carolina	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, and
Alabama	LOCATION	, -- passing rapidly through them ; in
Louisiana	LOCATION	he stopped a little longer ;
Mississippi	LOCATION	he did not enter ; in
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Norih Carolina	LOCATION	he saw more of Southern institutions .

		It was Olmsted 's peculiar stock of theori ^ and prejudices that made and still makes his book such interesting reading .

		A hater of slavery , he had no great love for the negro .

		He believed that the white people , in all the relations of life , were injured by slavery , and he was of the opinion that the economic rather than the moral side of slavery was the ruinous one .

		In his view , all the ills of the South might be traced to the bad economic conditions produced by slavery .

		At the same time it is evident that Olmsted , before going South , had been fascinated by what he had heard of the patriarchal institution .

		Southern luxury ,
Southern	ORGANIZATION	social life , and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	hospitality .

		He had formed an idea of a wicked and uneco - nomic but pleasant and brilliant civilization ; and his disgust at what he found is amusing .

		Concerning the matter of hospitality , for instance .

		Olmsted came South with the idea that the Southern people generally were accus - tomed to forcing hospitality upon the passing stranger of whatever degree , and he was greatly surprised to find that he had to pay his way just as in other sections of the country .

		The phrase ' Southern hospitality ' finally came to anger him ; he made it a point to inveigh against the tradition every time he made a note in his diary of paying a bill at one of the abominable Southern bostelries .

		The class of people with whom he stayed may be judged from the fact that he usually had , as he asserted , only one sheet on his bed and that one filthy .

		Olmsted had a few letters of intro - duction to planters , and it was mainly because of these that he said a few pleasant words about Southern things and people .

		We won - der what kind of a book he would have written had he brought numerous letters !

		He was also worried by the aristocratic pretensions of the Southerners , especially of the Virginians ; and he declared that most of their ancestors had been bought and sold as servants and laborers .

		Of the ability of Southern men in law and politics , he was very doubtful ; and many are the scornful words he writes concerning them .

		Governor Wise of
Virginia	LOCATION	, for instance , was characterized as a ` gasconading mountebank . '


South Carolina	LOCATION	statesmen were , he thought , of an especially low order .

		In general he was 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, quite skeptical concerning Southern ability .

		In a place like
Charleston	LOCATION	, he admitted , people fitted to go to a dinner-party might be easily found ; but he maintains that the great major - ity of the slave-holders were coarse and illit - erate , and lower-lived than the common laborers of the North .

		And in his opinion the poor whites , especially those in the Black Belt , were as low as the negroes .

		The South
Caro	PERSON	- linians were in general ` a. decayed and stulti - fied people , ' and the women of the non-slave - holding class , -- a class which numbered about three hundred thousand in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, -- were , he intimates , distinguished by a lack of chastity .

		It was mainly from Olmsted 's descriptions that Caimes , the Irish economist , formed his well-known theories of Southern society with its five million white vagabonds wandering over vast and dreary wastes .

		The most valuable of Olmsted 's observations were in regard to the institution of slavery .

		He tells us what he saw of the work , dress , food , morals , homes , and family life of the negroes , of the prices of slaves and the wages of negroes and whites .

		He knew nothing of the history of the negro , and took it for granted that American slavery was degrading the negro race , not uplifting it in any way .

		Believing that strict discipline was degrading to anyone , he was of the opinion that the stringent regu - lation of slavery was hurtful to the character of the slave , and he undertook to prove it by asserting that the discipline in the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	had bad .

		effects on the character of the white sailors .

		Notwithstanding the fact that he was disgusted with the stupid negro slaves , Olmsted sometimes insisted on crediting the blacks with white sensibilities , though usually they are described as but little above the brutes .

		In one place he declares that cruelty and driving are necessary to make slavery pay ; in another place , a planter is commended for using a system of tasks and rewards to secure willing labor , and this example is cited as the proper way to make slaves work .

		When deny - ing that the slave was as well fed as the North - ern laborer , he intimates that the negro was often not well fed ; later we are told that he had plenty of food .

		The necessity of cruelty to make the slave work is constantly empha - sized , as well as the increasing degradation of the slaves ; but in an unguarded moment the admission is made that in the border states the condition of slaves had been bettered during the last generation , -- a ^ fact also shown by his numerous quotations from
Southern	ORGANIZATION	author - ities , which are not commented upon by him .

		In both
North and South	ORGANIZATION	, the free negro was out of place , and his condition no better than that of the slave ; and freed negroes sent
North	ORGANIZATION	often returned .

		The descriptions of slavery , when the traveller really came in contact with it , form what would be a not unpleasant pic - ture if looked at through the eyes of anyone but a hostile critic who paid slight attention to the ameliorations of the institution .

		If the negro were inferior to the white , then he must have been doing fairly well in the life that Olmsted describes , -- wages for extra work , the privileges of having poultry , pigs , gardens , fine attire for
Sunday	DATE	, and slight punishment .

		Many things picturesque and pleasant to the sight of others were harrowing to our traveller from the North .

		It was in its economic aspect that the worst evils of slavery were touched upon ; and hen Olmsted could satisfy himself more by stating facts , and less by expressions of opinion .

		Reliar ble statistics make clear the burden upon the planter caused by the necessity of investing most of his capital in labor ; but the effect upon the price of slaves of pro-slavery sentiment caused by anti-slavery agitation was not men - tioned .

		The tendency of slavery to drive the poorer whites to the less fertile lands and to the frontiers was seen but not fully understood by the Northern farmer , who felt that slavery was a great evil to the whites , but was unable to interpret the facts he collected .

		He did not see what forty years of freedom have shown , that it was tlie negro , not slavery , that injured the economic system of the South ; slavery only made the negro a more powerful instrument of evil to the poor whites .

		Released from the restraints of slavery , the negro no longer so seriously competes with the white laborer , because free negro labor is not as efficient as slave labor was .

		Slave labor was very costly labor , and
Olmsted	ORGANIZATION	's comparisons on this point were instructive : wages for common laborers were twenty-five per cent higher in the South than in the North ; the hire of a negro was more than that of a wliite man on the same plantation ; to protect the valuable negro slaves from injury , Irish laborers were often imported to do heavy and dangerous work ; it was next to impossible to keep the negro from shamming illness in order to escape work ; the slave , on account of his clumsiness , could not be tri ^ ted - ^ vith improved farm implements , and often had no interest in doing his work well .

		All this , and much more , Olmsted criticises justly ; but in his eagerness to denounce slavery , he reaxjhes the incredible .

		For instance , he claims that in
Virginia	LOCATION	the cost of slave labor was three hun - dred to four hundred per cent higher than the cost of free labor in
New York	LOCATION	, which was probably about correct .

		But he then proceeds to quote statistics to show that a negro in Vir - ginia would gather in a day one-eighteenth to one-twenty-fourth as much wheat from one - eighth as much land as a laborer in
New York	LOCATION	.

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 205 Surely slavery was hardly so bad as that !

		He cited , as a fact to prove the worthlessness of slave labor , that the negroes would stop work to look at the passing trains !

		That there was a strong anti-slavery feeling all over the South was clearly proved by Olm - sted 's investigations .

		He was interested by this sentiment , but ascribed little importance to it .

		There were numbers of people who wished to have slavery abolished , provided the negro couldj be gotten rid of .

		The facts quoted do not agree with the theory of the blind devotion of the South to slavery .

		Olmsted showed that slavery could not exist in the territories of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, yet pretended to fear slavery expan - sion in that direction .

		This was simply a reflec - tion of the anti-slavery agitation of the time .

		This Northern traveller was an easy mark for the spinners of yarns .

		Many wonderful tales went down into his voluminous note-books .

		Even the negroes guyed him , but he was per - fectly serious always .

		He did not see the point of a joke while in the South .

		Many important things were overlooked : the development of the lower South after
1820	DATE	, with interests some - what distinct from those of the upper South ; the rapid rise of manufacturers in the white districts ; the changes being wrought in econo - mic conditions , especially in the border states , by the introduction of improved machinery and by railroads , and above all by losing competi - tion with the free states ; the difference between the economics of the frontier and the economics of slavery ; the fact that the slave was the rural mechanic of the South ; -- all this escaped him entirely .

		On the whole , the work is of great value to the student of economic history .

		There is much in it that is useless , and the useless is hard to separate from the good ; but what Olmsted really saw and heard is the valuable part .

		His facts are of value , but he was not always able to interpret them , being hampered by his strong prejudices against slavery and all that pertained to it .

		His opinions and theories .

		Which might or might not have been true , are of no value except as a moderate statement of the abolitionist argument .

		His numerous quo - tations are all to support his thesis ; there is no other side .

		He quotes
Defoe	PERSON	's '
Moll Flan	PERSON	- ders ' as an authority on early
Virginia	LOCATION	history .

		To the
Black Belt	ORGANIZATION	, emancipation has brought none of the good predicted ; but it has brought good to the white districts .

		At times , Olmsted seemed to feel that this would be the case , though he felt bound to say that the free negro would be a better worker and better man than the slave .

		As a specimen of bookmaking , the new edi - tion is far superior to the old , although the illustrations are unfortunately omitted .

		The biographical sketch , by the author 's son , gives only the main facts of his life .

		The fourteen - page Introduction , by Professor
Trent	PERSON	, adds nothing to the value of the work .

		Professor
Trent	PERSON	says that Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, and Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, none of whom ever saw a slave plantation , thought that the ` Seaboard Slave States ' was an authority , and therefore it must be so , he reasons .

		He further calls attention to the fact that Olmsted saw only the unpleasant aspects of slavery , and that he was imposed upon by
Texas	LOCATION	story-tellers .


Walter L. Fleming	PERSON	.

		SIDE-IjIGHTS ox the IjOUISIAXA Purchase .

		* Not the least important of the fruits of the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	centenary is the extraor - dinary impetus it has given to historical research .

		bearing upon that vitally important period in the expansion of the
United States	LOCATION	which is now being so widely commemorated .

		It is of course nothing unusual for the centen - ary of a great historical event to be marked by the publication of books and pamphlets and magazine articles , to meet the increased public interest stimulated by the commemorative cele - brations ; but it is by no means usual to find either the public interest so thoroughly aroused , or the historical literature so extensive and important , as in the present case .

		It may be that this , condition is largely due to the fact that the people of the
United States	LOCATION	have never really lost interest in that most pic - turesque and far-sighted bit of statecraft , the purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	from
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		The acquisition of what was in
Jefferson	LOCATION	's day for the most part an unknown wilderness , tenanted only by wild tribes , seemed to many of his con - temporaries a piece of extravagant madness ; yet , in the light of subsequent events the sum paid was absolutely paltry , for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	thus gained possession of an enormous territory , holding the potentialities of unlim - ited wealth and , what to citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	must be much more important , the seeds of national greatness .

		The gradual apprecia - tion of the magnitude of the heritage thus bequeathed to the American people accounts for the fact that for a hundred years they have never really forgotten the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Pur - chase , and it needed no artificial stimulus to

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, arouse their interest in the wealth of historical material that has grown up around the subject during the past year or two .

		One need not go to
St. Louis	LOCATION	to find out that the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	is very much in the public eye .

		It is hardly possible to glance through the lists of any of the leading Ameri - can publishers without meeting something new upon the subject .

		It may be a history of the period from some fresh point of view ; a biog - raphy of one of the men who made the
Louisi	LOCATION	- ana Purchase possible , or explored the vast ter - ritory thus acquired ; a novel with this period and this boundless frontier as its setting ; a carefully annotated edition of one of the early journals that are part of the original records ; or perhaps merely a reprint of one of these journals ; or , finally , the publication for the first time of some important historical manu - script that has lain for years in the library of one of the public institutions , where it was known to only a few inquisitive students .

		The peculiar importance of the volume now under review lies in the fact that it embraces material , of considerable historical importance and interest , that has not hitherto been avail - able in printed form .

		The two documents in question ,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	's paper on ` The Limits and Bounds of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, ' and
William Dunbar	PERSON	's Journal of ` The Exploration of the Eed , the Black , and the
Washita Rivers	LOCATION	, ' have formed part of the collection of historical manuscripts in the library of the
American Philosophical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and are now published by direction of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's committee on his - torical documents .

		The Jeffersonian paper was prepared while the author was President of the
United States	LOCATION	, and gives a summary of the various claims of
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	to territory in the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley , and lays down the bounda - ries of the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	.

		The original , in
Jefferson	LOCATION	's own hand , was deposited by him in the archives of the
Philosophical Society	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, w ` here it still remains .

		The text of the paper is prefixed by a transcript of Jef - ferson 's letter to
Peter S. Du Ponceau	PERSON	, Corre - sponding Secretary of the Society , transmitting the manuscript .

		This letter throws an intimate and very interesting light both upon several incidents connected with the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Pur - chase , and upon the personality of the writer .

		The
Dunbar Journal	ORGANIZATION	is a document that one is extremely glad to see in printed form .

		While lacking much of the human interest of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	journals , and recording an expedition of comparatively minor importance , it is yet of distinct value as a contribution to the historical literature of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are told , in the ' Publisher 's Note , ' that
Dunbar	PERSON	himself was a man of note , and had been hon - ored in his native state as ' the first scientist of
Mississippi	LOCATION	. '

		He was born at Thunderton near
Elgin	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, a younger son of Sir
Archi	PERSON	- bald
Dunbar	PERSON	, and united -LRB- as so many eminent men among his countrymen have done -RRB- prac - tical and scientific abilities of a high order .

		He settled in
America	LOCATION	in
1771	DATE	, and became a suc - cessful planter .

		Later he held important trusts under the Federal government , was a corre - spondent ` of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, Sir
William Herschel	PERSON	,
David Rittenhouse	PERSON	, and other famous men , and made many contributions of import - ance to the scientific interests of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The exploratory journey , of which the Journal now printed forms the record , was undertaken at the request of President
Jeffer	PERSON	- son , in
1804	DATE	, as ' a part of Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's statesmanlike plan to survey the vast new ter - ritory just coming into the possession of the
United States	LOCATION	. '

		The Journal covers a wealth of material bearing upon the geographical , botanical , and geological features of the country traversed by
Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	, and throws a great deal of light upon the condition of that portion of the country one hundred years ago .

		When
Dunbar	PERSON	made his way up the
Red River	LOCATION	, the Black , and the
Washita	LOCATION	, to the hot springs that were even then somewhat famous , he found only a handful of settlers , scattered at long intervals along the rivers , and ekeing out a miserable livelihood by hunting in the neighboring woods .

		It can not be said that
Dunbar	PERSON	himself was very favor - ably impressed with the capabilities of this district as a field for settlement , and as a mat - ter of fact it remained practically unoccupied for many years after his visit .

		Its chief importance , during
the first quarter	DATE	of the nine - teenth century , was as one of the important routes of Avestern migration from the Mis - sissippi to the far West , where the frontier was being slowly but irresistibly pushed into Spanish territory .

		There was , says Miss
Ellen Semple	PERSON	in her recent work on `
American History	ORGANIZATION	and its Geographic Conditions , ' an occasional
Ameri	PERSON	- can planter , at this time , between the Missis - sippi and the
Washita	LOCATION	, and some American immigrants far up the
Red River	LOCATION	, ` while a band of adventurers under
Philip N'olan	ORGANIZATION	had penetrated to the
Brazos River	LOCATION	in the present state of
Texas	LOCATION	, ' but the Red River and the
Washita	LOCATION	were not for many yeare to know much more than the casual visits of explorers , hunt - ers , and those intrepid pathfinders of the West who were paving the way for the future acquisition of
Texas	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to note that at the very time that
Dunbar	PERSON	was making his slow and troublesome
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 way up the
Red River	LOCATION	and its tributaries , impeded by sandbars or rapids at almost every turn ,
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	were pushing up the
Missouri	LOCATION	toward the
Mandan	LOCATION	villages where they were to spend the winter .

		The make-up of the volume containing these documents is admirable , and worthy in every way of the important material which it covers .

		The utmost care has been taken to preserve the characteristics of the time , as regards spelling , typography , and ornamentation .

		There are two excellent portraits in the book , one of Jef - ferson , from the original painted by
Thomas Sully	PERSON	, now in the rooms of the American Philo - sophical Society at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; and the other of
Dunbar	LOCATION	, from a painting at the family home near
Natchez	LOCATION	,
Miss.	LOCATION	.

		The map of
Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	's voyage is a photo-lithograph from a very fine copper-plate engraving of
Nicholas King	PERSON	's map in the War Department at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It seems ungracious to say even a word of dispraise of such an admirable piece of book - making ; yet delightful and desirable as these exact reprints are from many points of view , the student often feels that he would sacrifice much in the way of typographical exactitude if he might have in return a good index .

		That is the one thing lacking in the present book .

		T ^ vo American Historians .

		* Among recent issues in the group of brief biographies known as the ' ^ American Men of Letters ' series we have had lives of
William Hickling Prescott	PERSON	and
Francis Parkman	PERSON	.

		Although a full generation lay between the careers of the two historians , there is a special advantage in this chance association of the two biographies thus closely paired .

		It is not only that both these writers are accepted classics in the somewhat restricted field of American his - torical literature , but a peculiar parallellism runs through the records of their lives .

		Their resemblance in personal traits is itself notable ; they were affable , refined , thoroughly repre - sentative of the traditional
New England	LOCATION	aristocracy of culture ; they were delightful comrades in the intimacy of their respective friendships .

		Each in his own pathetic expe - rience of physical infirmity , heroically defiant of disability , and of suffering often acute ; each , also , sturdily independent in his fortitude , impatient of sympathy , tenacious in purpose , and affording in his achievement such an example of magnificent endurance as scarcely finds a parallel in literary annals except as the * William

		story of one appears to duplicate that of the other .

		It is inevitable that in the attempt to portray either of these attractive characters , the biographer should write sympathetically , not to say enthusiastically , of his subject .

		Prescott was born in
1796	DATE	, Parkman in
1823	DATE	.

		The former was graduated from Har - vard in
1814	DATE	, the latter just thiri ;
y years later	DATE	.

		Prescott 's first historical work , the ' Ferdinand and
Isabella	PERSON	, ' was completed in
1836	DATE	; * The Pioneers of
France	LOCATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	, ' the real beginning of the great series which placed
Parkman	PERSON	's name with the names of
Prescott	PERSON	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	in contemporary recognition , appeared in
1865	DATE	.

		The first two volumes of ' Philip II . '

		were published in
1855	DATE	, and Pres - cott died , his work unfinished , in
1859	DATE	; Park - man was permitted to see the full completion of his chosen task ; it was in
1892	DATE	that the final volume of the series came from the press , fol - lowed by his death at the age of seventy in the following year .

		But how bare and colorless and commonplace is such a summary of life and work !

		The terrible handicap of failing vision , of nervous ailments , of insistent pain ; the resolute measures to be adopted , the won - derful self-control , the ingenious devices of an invalid persistently devoted to the accomplish - ment of a rarely ambitious task , the interrupted labors , the quiet waiting in darkened chambers , -- these are the details that give a just im - pressiveness to the triumphs of eventual suc - cess ; and in this strenuous fellowship of suf - fering and perseverance
Parkman	PERSON	and
Prescott	PERSON	are joined .

		The heroical element becomes so predomi - nant in any consideration of either writer that we touch for a moment upon this familiar ground .

		The nature of the accident which robbed
Prescott	PERSON	of the sight of one eye during his junior year in college is of course well known .

		Intervals of complete blindness fell upon him , and the fear of losing his sight en - tirely never left him .

		Assured by oculists that the remaining eye would prove adequate to the ordinary purposes of life if he would forego all literary labor , the student declined to retreat .

		Calmly he determined that even should sight fail altogether , while hearing remained his lit - erary ambitions should be realized .

		The real significance of this resolve appears when we remember that dictation was impossible for
Prescott	PERSON	and that the employment of a reader in the study of foreign books and manuscripts proved unsatisfactory and was often imprac - ticable .

		We meet `` in his journal with en - tries like these : ^ The lasit fortnight I have not read or written , in all , five minutes . '

		` If I could only have some use of my eyes ! '

		* I use my eyes ten minutes at a time , for an hour a day .

		So I snail it along . '

		Parkman 's afflic - 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, tion came from some obscure trouble of the brain which not only robbed him of his eyes , but affected also the action of heart and limbs .

		His working time was frequently reduced to less than half an hour a day , and there were long periods of utter helplessness . '

		Oh , think of what you have done ! '

		exclaimed a lady eager to comfort him during an interval of illness . '

		Done ! '

		he cried , his head rising from the pil - low , ' done !

		there is much more for me still to do V Such were the conditions under which these men labored , and such was the spirit in which they persevered .

		Partial blindness was not the oidy embarrassment ; a train of ail - ments accompanied and aggravated the condi - tion of each .

		It is always interesting to trace the links by which a scholar is attracted to the theme of his choice .

		In the case of
Parkman	LOCATION	, not only does the passion for historical study ap - pear to have been innate , but his fervid love of the woods and the wilderness , together with his profound interest in the manners and life of our native savage tribes , seems almost to have predetermined the chronicler of
Pontiac	LOCATION	to the selection of his romantic field .

		With
Prescott	PERSON	, on the other hand , there was a period of deliberation and considerable hesitancy in the quest of a subject .

		In
1857	DATE	he wrote to a friend thus : ' I had early conceived a strong passion for historical writing , to which , per - haps , the reading of
Gibbon	PERSON	's Autobiography contributed not a little .

		I proposed to make myself an historian in the best sense of the term . '

		Spanish literature first attracted his attention , as he followed the lectures of his friend Ticknor at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He began the study of Spanish in
1825	DATE	.

		After the first vagueness of his general plan , his mind began to settle about two possible topics for historical investigation -- Spanish history from the inva - sion of the Arabs to the consolidation of the monarchy under
Charles V.	PERSON	, and a history of the revolution of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, which con - verted the republic into an empire .

		This sec - ond subject he abandoned as he reflected that ^ the great and learned
Niebuhr	PERSON	has been em - ployed these dozen years upon it ... Shall I beat the bushes after this ?

		I have not quite decided , but I think not . '

		Literary history also attracted him ; but the germ of
Prescott	PERSON	's ' Ferdinand and
Isabella	PERSON	' lay in the Spanish theme , and after a year of pros and cons , he definitely subscribed to that .

		Into the details of either biograpihy it is un - necessary to enter here .

		The reader of Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	's book will note with interest a few new facts concerning
Prescott	PERSON	's brave and patient life .

		The style of the book is dignified and direct , the material is interesting and well arranged .

		A chapter upon ' Personal Traits ' is particularly inviting ; personal anecdotes and extracts from letters and journals are liberally introduced throughout -- material which vivi - fies the portrait of the man whose heart was so warm that
Hillard	PERSON	declared it made
Prescott	PERSON	's friends forget that he was ; a great historian and only think of him ' as a person to be loved .

		Mr.
SedgAvick	PERSON	's volume is proportioned oddly .

		Two-thirds of the book is crowded with par - ticulars , significant and insignificant , of the historian 's early years up to his twenty-seventh , leaving less than a hundred pages for the story of the long , pathetic , and inspiring life of won - derful accomplishment which crovnied a stren - uous and strongly assertive youth .

		It is writ - ten vivaciously , even pertly at times .

		The later story of
Francis Parkman	PERSON	is too important to be disposed of in this brief fashion , and the material of the earlier chapters should have been sifted .

		The youthful records of schoolboy explorations are interesting , but much of the matter could well have been spared .

		We would not , however , miss the pleasant pictures of the invalid upon the veranda at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	play - ing with the children and the cats , or cultivat - ing the famous rose beds at his residence on the shore of
Jamaica Pond	LOCATION	.

		In such scenes the healthy and genial spirit of
Parkman	LOCATION	is more intimately expressed .

		1904 -RSB- THE DIAL 209 establish itself upon the throne of
France	LOCATION	; and a third meaning will occur to the mind of every reader , considering that through this work the entertaining talent of the author makes its final appeal to the reading public .

		The scene is shifted from time to time between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, while the period is the middle of the nineteenth century , -- the year just preceding the usurpation of power by
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	.

		One is at first a little dismayed to discover that the author has once more raked up the old story of the Dauphin and the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, but fear becomes allayed when it is discovered that the legend is not taken seriously , but is made to serve only as a peg for the hanging of a very ingenious royalist intrigue against the Napoleonic pretensions .

		For a time , indeed , we are led to believe that the
Dauphin	PERSON	did escape , that he was taken to Eng - land , grew up , married , had a child , and died soon thereafter .

		In this child of the unknown French refugee we have the hero of the present romance ; but it transpires after awhile that he can not be the nineteenth
Louis	LOCATION	.

		Before this fact emerges , however , and before the hero himself becomes sure of it , he has put himself so imre - servedly in the hands of the plotters , and is so deeply involved in their machinations , that he finds it impossible to withdraw , and so the con - spiracy goes on , until the Man of
December	DATE	scores his final triumph and all conspiracies against his power are made hopeless .

		We do not quite see why the hero should have to be sacrificed in the end by drowning him , for he has been alternately in love with two interesting young women , one of whom he might easily have been made to marry .

		Perhaps the author himself could not decide be - tween the two , and so resorted to this cowardly evasion of his responsibilities .

		The story is told with all of the author 's wonted cleverness , his easy knowledge of the world , and his happy trick of incisive phrase and dramatic situation .

		It seems to us about as good as any of the books that he published during his life time .

		Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, after dallying for a period with romantic adventure in
Spain	LOCATION	, returns in * Strong Mac ' to the Scotch scenes and charac - ters which have brought him his most genuine success .

		Since the time is that of the Napoleonic wars , he is enabled to introduce a Spanish episode of a few chapters ; for the heroine is compelled at a certain critical juncture to journey to the
Penin	PERSON	- sula , and seek out in
Wellington	LOCATION	's army the sol - dier whose presence is needed in
Scotland	LOCATION	to clear her lover from the charge of murder .

		Of course she is successful , and of course the witness ar - rives in the nick of time , just as sentence is about to be pronounced .

		Strong Mac is a fine specimen of manhood , and the villainies by which he is beset serve to bring out the best elements of his character .

		The heroine also finds ready access to our hearts .

		Her father , the village schoolmaster , a weak and dissipated person , albeit of good family and fine intellectual parts , is per - haps the most carefully studied figure in the story He never quite loses his hold on our sym - pathies , although it is chiefly for the daughter 's sake that we rejoice when he comes into unex - pected possession of the ancestral acres .

		The novel has a very complicated plot , enough mystery to keep the reader perplexed until the end , no little dry humor , and a wealth of the sort of detail that no one but a Scotsman born and bred could possibly have at command .

		The dialect feature is pronounced , which makes the book un - usually difficult reading , but this time the effort is really worth while , -- which can not always be said of the kail-yard fictional product .

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's Elizabethan romance , * The Ladder of Swords , ' is a slight performance which opens interestingly , but drags quite a little toward the close .

		It tells of the love between a soldier and a maiden of the Huguenot faith , opens in that island of Jersey that the author knows so well , and presently conducts the persons chiefly concerned to
London	LOCATION	, whither they are pursued by the vengeance of the Queen Mother , and saved only through the sjTupathy of
Eliza	LOCATION	- beth .

		The figure of the great Queen of
England	LOCATION	is firmly drawn upon conventional lines , albeit they are a little softened by a sentiment that the reader finds agreeable , but of which the historiaji will have his doubts .

		The figure of Leicester takes on a more sinister villainy than we have been wont to attribute to him , but he is of course unmasked , as all good villains are in historical romance , and his schemes to blight the happiness of the lovers are thwarted .

		There is a court jester of the super-sophisticated sort who might well be spared .

		Easily the best-conceived char - acter in the book is that of the bluff Seigneur of Rozel , who comes from
Jersey	LOCATION	with the refugees , stands by them at need , and returns to his island seigneury with enough stories of his amazing experiences to last for the rest of his days .

		Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	's new novel is called ` The Challoners , ' after the family which provides it with three out of its five leading characters .

		The senior
Challoner	PERSON	is an English clergyman of the most austere and uncompromising type .

		He has two children , a boy and a girl , from whose sympathies he becomes hoj > elessly estranged by the exercise of what he narrowly believes to be his duty toward them .

		He loves them , but he nags them ; and the nagging makes their life miserable , for they are young people of the modem age , with individualities of their own .

		The boy is a musi - cal genius of whom his father tries to make a classical scholar .

		The girl is not a genius at all , but she knows her own heart , and cleaves to the man who loves her in the face of paternal opposition .

		In this opposition is the crux of the whole plot ; for her lover is a man who positively rejects the religious dogmatism of her father .

		In a word , the story turns upon a situation so old - fashioned that we thought it had disappeared from fiction for good .

		It is only by making the father a survival of the age of theological big - otry that such a situation can be given the slight - est degree of probability in our time .

		How re - lentlessly the author depicts this vanished cleri - cal type may be illustrated by the fact that the daughter is forbidden to read the novels of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	.

		That she does read them in secret , and that she smokes an occasional cigarette , are causes of SlO THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, offense so great as to be overshadowed only by the obstinacy of her love for a man without religion in her father 's narrow sense .

		Although this com - plication is worked up with a great deal of earn - estness , the author does not succeed in making it seem real to us .

		The humorous element in the narrative is supplied by a garrulous old lady whose conviction is what the French call decousue .

		A little of it proves amply satisfying ; and , after the first few chapters , we cheerfully skip this old lady 's monologues .

		It seems to us a little wanton in Mr.
Benson	PERSON	to kill the musical genius in the final chapter .

		He gives us quite enough agony without that unnecessary supplement .

		There is no denying the insight and the power of Mrs.
Voynich	PERSON	's novels , but there is an element of the unreal about them which , combined with an infusion of morbid thought and feeling , pre - vents them from achieving the highest effects .

		They are so intense in their emotional aspect that they suffer as representations of human life , which is not , even under the most tragic condi - tions , quite so dismal an affair as the author makes it out to be .

		We should place Mrs.
Voy	PERSON	- nich 's new novel about midway in the scale be - tween its two predecessors . '

		Olive
Latham	PERSON	' is not as hopelessly repellant in theme as was *
Jack Raymond	PERSON	, ' nor is it as fresh and varied in its interest as was ' The Gadfly . '

		It is essentially the history of the wrecking of a woman 's soul by suffering , followed by a period in which she hov - ers on the verge of insanity , and ending with a note of hopefulness as she gradually gropes her way out of the valley of the shadow and the bal - ance of her nature shows signs of restoration .

		As a study in psychology , this is marvellously well done , and the external interest is not inadequate to the situation .

		The heroine is an English woman , but her story is primarily one of Russian despotism .

		That it is which does to death her husband , a Polish conspirator , and comes near to shattering her own reason .

		If the depth of the writer 's feelings were matched by a correspond - ing clearness of thought and strength of object - ive grasp , this book would be much more nearly a masterpiece than it now is .

		The hero of *
Richard Gresham	PERSON	, ' Mr.
Robert Morss Lovett	PERSON	's first novel , starts out in life with an overwhelming burden laid upon his shoulders .

		His father is an embezzler and a fugitive from justice , which fact , declared when
Richard	PERSON	is a boy of nine , is destined to shape the whole course of his life .

		He grows up with the understanding that it is his paramount duty to meet the obliga - tions thus incurred , and redeem the family name .

		We follow his fortunes from childhood up ; the rough farm life of his boyish years , his painfully - acquired education , his experience as a mining engineer in
Mongolia	LOCATION	, and his career as a stock broker in
Ncav York	LOCATION	, are the successive phases of his history , and they are all presented in a thor - oughly interesting and human way .

		His efforts meet with success , but the commercial and social influences which suiTound him in
New York	LOCATION	, and his marriage with a woman whose ethical instincts are confused , come near to blunting the fine sense of honor which has shaped his career , and he falters at the critical moment , almost failing of the moral victory when it is within his grasp .

		That he should thus hesitate , seems to us , consid - ering what his life has been up to that point , an element of weakness in Mr.
Lovett	PERSON	's book ; and we can not quite forgive him for choosing the somewhat sophisticated affection of the woman whom he marries , in preference to the less calcu - lating and more genuine love of his earlier years , -- the chorus girl who afterwards becomes a star of the lyric stage .

		But these are no reasons for our quarrelling seriously with a book which shows so much ability , and which is one of the best pro- ductions of the current season .

		In Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	's new novel , also , as the title indicates , a point of honor is made the basis of the action .

		It is a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	novel , and the leading characters are two young instructors in the English department , both aspirants for the favor of a young woman in whose veins flows the bluest of
Cambridge	LOCATION	blood .

		Tke successful aspi - rant is the author of a widely-read book upon the social conscience , -- a work which , unfortvmately , he has plagiarized in considerable measure from an old and long-forgotten volume .

		This fact is discovered by the other man , who proceeds to unmask his rival .

		For a time , the plagiarist faces the accusation with a brazen denial ; but the evi - dence is too convincing , and he is forced in the end to admit his guilt .

		His engagement is actu - ally broken , he resigns his position , and seeks secluded lodgings in a
Boston	LOCATION	suburb .

		Here he works out a sort of moral regeneration , which in the end wins back for him something of self-re - spect , and -- what the average reader will hold quite as important -- the love that he seemed to have lost irretrievably .

		Thus mounting once more * The Steps of Honor , ' he patches up , after a fashion , the life that one false step has so nearly ruined .

		Another young woman provides conso - lation for the rival , and the outcome is made a fairly happy one .

		Mr.
King	PERSON	has given us a faith - ful study of life in these academic circles , and certain of his secondary characters afford us much entertainment .

		One point we are inclined to labor a little , because of its unconscious revela ^ tion of an attitude not uncommon in our older
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	universities .

		When the hero 's dishonesty is detected , his rival tells him that he must * get out ' of
Harvard	LOCATION	, and go where no one will ever hear of him again .

		He is then advised that ' one of the Western colleges ' will be the proper place for him , and is promised that if he thus betakes himself to the outer darkness no whisper of his fault shall go with him .

		For a story-teller who is writing as a professional moralist , this atti - tude is , to say the least , peculiar .

		The episode is highly illuminating .

		We must mention one other matter .

		Mr.
King	PERSON	is one of the people who still believe -LRB- page 27 -RRB- that witches were once burned at Salem .

		Some superstitions die hard !

		* The Transgression of
Andrew Vane	PERSON	, ' by the late Guy
Wetmore Caxyll	PERSON	, is a story of the Amer - ican colony in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Andrew 's transgression is the usual one , resulting from his acquaintance Avith the frail but fascinating
Mirabelle Tre	ORGANIZATION	- monceau , which in turn results from his falling
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIi 211 into the hands of a designing scoundrel who lives upon blackmail .

		How
Andrew	PERSON	is finally forgiven by the girl whom he loves , and how the villain comes to a melodramatic end , are matters worked out with curious ingenuity of detail .

		A prologue , dated before the birth of the hero , is supposed to prepare us for the shock of learning his true parentage , but is so obscurely written that the revelation , when it does come , is too startling to be acceptable .

		After having thought otherwise all through the book , we are suddenly called upon to believe that
Andrew	PERSON	's father is the villain who has been seeking his ruin .

		And the device involved for this explanation is a ridiculous story of hypnotism used for a malign purpose .

		We can not admit the legitimacy of this invention , but the story is otherwise one of striking inter - est , and minutely realistic in its portrayal of the fashionable life of the French capital , -- at least , of such aspects of that life as come readily within the foreign visitor 's range of observation .

		Both in dialogue and description it is a singularly clever performance .

		* The Merry
Anne	PERSON	' is a story of adventure , told by Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	.

		The name of a lumber schooner on
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	gives the book its title , and the captain and part owner thereof is one
Dick Smiley	PERSON	, a dashing young person in love with
Annie Fargo	PERSON	, a maiden who lives in a house on stilts , situated on the shore of the lake just north of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Henry
Smiley	PERSON	, who is
Dick	PERSON	's cousin ,
Joe McGlory	PERSON	and his wife , who keep a saloon near by , and one
Bedloe	LOCATION	, or
Bever	PERSON	- idge , a special agent of the
United States Treas	LOCATION	- ury , are other leading characters .

		And thereby hangs the tale .

		For Henry is no other than the notorious
Whiskey Jim	PERSON	, the head of a daring com - bination of smugglers , who do their distilling on a Canadian island in northern
Lake Huron	LOCATION	, in - geniously conceal the product in hollow logs , and ship it to
Chicago	LOCATION	, where
McGlory	PERSON	sees that it is properly distributed .

		Dick knows nothing of all this , but is brought into innocent complicity with the criminals by taking on a load of this compromising lumber , and bringing it to
Chicago	LOCATION	.


Beveridge	PERSON	, who has long been on the trail of the gang , discovers this contraband cargo , which makes things look black for
Dick	PERSON	.

		But the latter , offering to help in running down the real crimi - nals , joins in the chase , which carries the party through many desperate adventures , and ends by capturing the real
Whiskey Jim	PERSON	and freeing his cousin
Dick	PERSON	from suspicion .

		Incidentally ,
Bever	PERSON	- idge , who has been
Dick	PERSON	's rival with
Annie	PERSON	, finds that he has no chance in that quarter , and for consolation takes up with
McGlory	PERSON	's widow .

		The whole stoiy is worked up very effectively , and becomes fairly thrilling toward the close .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	does not waste many words upon fine writing , but goes straight ahead in an incisive and vigorous way , gathering up his loose ends one by one and weaving them into a compact yet variegated fabric .

		Mr.
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	's new novel , ' The Seeker , ' tells the life-history of one
Bemal Lin	PERSON	- ford , dealing particularly with his emancipation from the depressing orthodoxy of the religious belief in which he has been reared .

		It is a book of distinctly didactic purpose , as much so as '
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	, ' for example , but with little of the subtlety and gentle persuasiveness of that remarkable work .

		The dogmatism from which Linford revolts as he grows to clear-sighted man - hood is of a type that hardly exists at the present day , or at least exists in nothing more than a simulacrum of its former vitality .

		Thus the author is largely concerned in doing battle with a man of straw , and his weapons are as old-fash - ioned and discredited as the equipment of his adversary .

		The argument that he uses is of the Voltaire-Paine-Ingersoll sort -- a kind of attack that has done good and effective work in its day , but has little force or meaning when applied to the spiritualized modem conception of religious faith .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	seems to have no notion of the philosophical principles underlying the relig - ious problem as it exists to-day ; he assails the literal -LRB- and un-literary -RRB- interpretation of texts and formularies , and scores an easy triumph .

		For the rest , this book embodies enough of a story , and of characters in variety , to be readable , except for its pages of arid polemics ; there is also a good deal of charm about the portrayal of the hero 's childhood , for the work is essentially an imagined biography , and begins at the begin - ning .

		It is marred by a straining for original terms of expression , which serves only to accentu - ate the crudity of the style .

		Miss
Frances Powell	PERSON	attracted some attention two or three years ago by a novel called * The
House	ORGANIZATION	on the Hudson ' -- a melodramatic piece of work exhibiting many crudities of diction and imagination , yet suggestive in a curious way of no less a work than '
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. '

		Miss
Powell	PERSON	's second novel , * The By - Ways of
Braithe	LOCATION	, ' is al - most a replica of the first in its setting , its atmos - phere of mystery , and its leading types of char - acter .

		It is grossly improbable in plot , and the persons who figure in it are constantly doing and saying the most impossible things , yet it has a certain interest , and one can not help feeling that the exercise of a little thoughtfulness and re - straint would make a more than acceptable novel - ist out of its writer .

		Thus far , she strains too much for her effects , and is clearly bent upon be - ing original and striking at no matter what artistic cost .

		On the other hand , she employs a sort of machinery that takes us back into the dark ages of romantic fiction , -- secret passages , mysterious portents mysteriously realized , and heavy villainy combined with attractive person - ality .

		Braithe is an old mansion on the
Hudson	LOCATION	, built in exact imitation of an English prototype , and its ' by-ways ' are the secret chambers and exits of which we hear a great deal , but which are finally utilized in a disappointing way only .

		Miss
Beatrix Lloyd	PERSON	's ' The Pastime of Eter - nity ' is an interesting novel , and it has rather more originality than we find in most current productions , particularly in first ventures .

		The situations and the climaxes are a little strained , and the writer has a propensity for the use of strange , imeouth words , which simply irritate the reader and add nothing to the expression .

		These 212 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, are superficial faults , however , and the writer maj ' ^ easily learn to avoid them .

		Holbein is an attractive character , and we can not quite under - stand how he came to be so mismated .

		The ex - planation given us later on does not really ex - plain .

		He has , however , the compensation of being loved by two exceptionally gifted young women , although he does not discover it for some time .

		When the discovery is made , and his suf - ferings have made a sufficient demand upon our sympathies , the writer remorselessly slays his frivolous wife in an automobile accident , and opens the path of happiness for himself and one of the young women .

		The other , necessarily , has a hard time of it .

		The story of the
Chevalier de Besarique	ORGANIZATION	, who starves himself to death when all is lost save honor , - is a gruesomely impressive epi - sode , and leads to much self-torturing on the part of his daughter , who is the favored young woman before mentioned .

		Miss
Lloyd	PERSON	has a pretty gift of style , of which we shall watch the development with much curiosity . '

		The Rose of Old
St. Louis	LOCATION	, ' by Miss
Mary Dillon	PERSON	, is a fairly interesting historical novel , although one of the hopelessly artificial sort .

		Considered as history , it is a work which shows careful study of the documentary material , and takes comparatively few liberties with fact .

		Con - sidered as romance , it reproduces for the hun - dredth time the two stock figures of dashing hero and petulant but winsome heroine .

		It is a story of matters relating to the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and , after getting well under way in
America	LOCATION	, takes us to
France	LOCATION	, where the reader is invited to be present at the negotiations for the
Louisi	LOCATION	- ana Territory , and makes a bowing acquaintance with the
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	and other historical charac - ters .

		The heroine turns out to be of royal blood , being a cousin of the
Prince de Polignac	ORGANIZATION	and the hapless Due d'Enghien , but this does not prevent her from preferring the love of a simple Ameri - can gentleman to any pampered minion of an effete aristocracy .

		It is all strangely familiar as well as curiously unconvincing .

		But as such romantic inventions go , the story is one of the best of its sort . '

		The
Effendi	PERSON	, ' by Mrs.
Florence Brooks White	PERSON	- house , opens with a prologue descriptive of the fall of
Khartoum	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	, and the death of Gror - don .

		Two children , a brother and sister of Greek - American parentage , are among the inhabitants who are taken captive , and it is Avith their later fortunes that the story is concerned .

		When the next scene opens , in
1897	DATE	, and
Kitchener	LOCATION	's ex - pedition is under way , these children , trained to
Mohammedan	PERSON	life , and forgetful of their early years , have grown up ; the girl is an inmate of her captor 's harem , the boy a soldier , the
Effendi	PERSON	of the title .

		The scene of the greater part of the romance is at
Luxor	LOCATION	, and three im - portant new characters appear -- an English oflicer under
Kitchener	LOCATION	, a young English clergy - man his friend , and an American girl who has known and loved the English officer years before .

		Then follows a pretty series of complications , leading to disclosures of parentage and prospec - tive weddinsrs .

		The
Effendi	PERSON	is sacrificed in the closing chapter , just after the reoccupation of
Khartoum	LOCATION	and the payment of tardy funeral hon - ors to
Gordon	PERSON	's memory .

		This seems to have been the easiest way to dispose of him , since there was no one left for him to love , and his recently-discovered European status made it diffi - cult for the author to shape a new career for him .

		The story is based upon a number of im - probabilities , chief among which is the dual ex - istence of Uarda as harem inmate and dashing coquette employed to spy upon the English resi - dents of
Luxor	LOCATION	, but it has romantic charm and a picturesque setting , which qualities entitle it to a hearing and commend it to the favor of the novel-reader .

		After all these matters of history and philos - ophy , of sensation and social dilemma , it is a re - lief to take up such a book as ' The Affair at the Inn , ' which has not about it the faintest sugges - tion of an idea or a problem or a historical hap - pening , but is just frothiness and sentiment and playful satire , and may well serve as a sort of pousse-cafe for the present repast of many courses .

		It is the joint production of four writers , Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	, Miss
Mary Findlater	PERSON	, Miss
Jane Helen Findlater	PERSON	, and Mr.
Allan McAulay	PERSON	.

		It has four principal charac - ters , whom fate brings together at a Dartmoor inn , and for each of these characters one of the writers is responsible .

		They take turns in com - posing the several chapters of the book , all of which are in the first person .

		The humor of the thing results from the fact that every trivial episode is described from his individual view - point by each of the persons concerned , and the contrasts are sometimes as startling as those of ' The Ring and the Book . '

		The result is a sprightly and sparkling little story which may be read in an hour , and which will leave the reader with a good conscience and a sense of cheerful - ness .

		And there is an hour now and then when no reader asks of a book more than that .

		A valuable guide to poems and recitations It is not too much to say that a long-felt want has been in good measure supplied by Miss
Edith Granger	PERSON	's ' Index to Poetry and Recitations ' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , a quarto volume of 970 closely printed pages . '

		Over thirty thousand titles from three hundred and sixty-nine books ' are here indexed three and in some cases four times , -- in a title index , an author index , an index to first lines , and a briefer subject index .

		One feature commended to our notice , but not unreservedly praiseworthy , is the fact that the 369 books dra ^ vn upon are all in print , and no out-of-print collections of poetry or recitations have been laid under contribution .

		Thus we fail to find many an old reading-book favorite , like
Bryant	PERSON	's ' African Chief ' and ' Monument Mountain , ' Mrs.
Barbauld	PERSON	's ' Sea - sons , '
J. G. Percival	PERSON	's ' Star of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, ' and Mrs.
Sigourney	PERSON	's ' Indian Summer . '

		THE DIAL 213 the old reading-books , such as
Hillard	PERSON	's , and Wil - son 's , and
Porter	PERSON	's ' Rhetorical Reader , ' and ' The National Reader ' -LRB- to go no farther back -RRB- could have been included in the sources indexed , the value of the work would have been very appreciably increased for those of an older gen - eration .

		Indeed , the space required for this might without too serious loss have been taken from the portion devoted to prose recitations , as in the vast majoritj ' of cases it is the dimly remembered poem , not the schoolboy declamation , that baffles our search .

		And if periodical litera - ture also could have been ransacked by our indus - trious editor and her co-workers , -- giving us a sort of
Poole	ORGANIZATION	's Index to Poetry , with all the rest , -- what a triumph were there of the indexer 's assiduity !

		But enough .

		It would be base ingrat - itude not to welcome with hearty praise the very scholarly and , so far as a rapid review can deter - mine , widely comprehensive and eminently trust - worthy index Miss
Granger	PERSON	's two-years ' work -LRB- with six assistants , and sometimes more -RRB- has furnished .

		The magnitude of the undertaking will be apparent to all who have ever engaged in similar researches . '

		Imperator et Rex , ' the latest Martyrdom of an Empress , ' describes the career of William II .

		of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is a volume of nearly three hundred pages , carefully printed -LRB- but for a few typographical errors -RRB- and tastefully bound -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This in praise of the book ; but anything further must depend upon the point of view and the literary taste of the reader .

		The author declares herself * a monarchist ' ready to accept , in its literal interpretation ,
William	ORGANIZATION	's famous Regis voluntas suprema lex , -- which , however , she explains as written in the Golden Book of the
Munich City Council	ORGANIZATION	, in jocose compliance with the wish of the King of
Bavaria	LOCATION	that he enter his autograph in a book otherwise reserved for the royal line of
Bavaria	LOCATION	.

		Few American readers will sympathize with this view ; while the author 's florid and exaggerated style rather serves to provoke laugh - ter than inspire * the dread and fear of kings . '

		As an example of the style may be cited the description of
William	LOCATION	's first meeting with the Empress , whom he seems to have disturbed dur - ing an afternoon nap in a hammock in the park at
Sehloss Prinkenau	ORGANIZATION	.

		The passage is nearly two pages long ; only the concluding lines can be quoted : * The grand old trees seemed to whisj > er to one another , as did the tall imperial lilies , the white meadow-sweets , and the haughty peonies , scatt-ered in the grass , that the sight was good to behold , and here and there a little thrill of inex - pressible gladness seemed to ruffle like crisping wavelets a field of anemones of all imaginable changeful hues , stretching a porte de vue the silk of their shivering corollas beneath the spreading boughs . '

		In the summing up of the Emperor 's various attainments , we read that * no one pos - sessing the full use of his or her senses can deny that he is a splendid soldier , an equally good sailor , a successful sportsman , a musician of no mean talent , an excellent painter and draughts - man , a first-class writer and poet too , -- a ses heures , an engineer and architect of considerable ability , besides being a scholar of repute and a thorough statesman , without mentioning the fact that he speaks nine or ten languages and is one of the most eloquent orators of modern times . '

		The book contains practically nothing new about the life or personality of the
Kaiser	PERSON	.

		In review - ing his career since his accession to the throne , we are always prepared to join cordially with his loyal subjects in their `
Heil	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilhelm	LOCATION	, Dir und
Segen	PERSON	!

		Das hast Du gut gemacht ' ; but the ful - some adulation of the present work is to be depre - cated .

		It tends to weaken rather than increase the honest respect that his steadfastness of pur - pose and his able statesmanship have inspired alike in friend and foe .

		The modern Irish literary revival and its leader .

		In such a book as Mr.
Horatio	PERSON	Sheaf e
Krans	PERSON	's ' William But - ler
Yeats	PERSON	and the Irish Literary Revival ' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the poet and dramatist finds another leaf to add to his crown of bay .

		The work is fully appreciative of all that Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has done in bringing home to the English speaking and reading public the beau - ties and glamour of Celtic literature , -- after , be it remembered , the writers in
Irish	LOCATION	had failed through translation to effect what his interpre - tations have been able to .

		The work is in five chapters , the first devoted to an entertaining and authentic account of the Irish literary revival as a whole , the rest specifically to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's share in it as evidenced by his * Poems based upon Irish Myth , Legend , and Romance , ' his ' Poems , Chiefly Lyrical , ' his ' Plays , ' and his * Prose . '

		To those unfamiliar previously with the work of this comparatively young man , the book will serve as a guide to be relied upon in taking the neophyte straight to the heart of the movement ; to those who are already pledged and devoted to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	as a vital -- some say the most vital -- force in contemporary English literature , the book will appeal as an admirable appreciation of his work , done by one like-minded with them - selves .

		But there is one aspect of the ease which Mr.
Krans	PERSON	does not consider -- does not even hint at .


Ireland	LOCATION	through many centuries has been almost the most devoted of the nations to the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		So long has this continued , that any inventory of Irish national characteristics and literature which does not take it into full account , is necessarily lacking .

		Now Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is by his own showing a believer in the undoubted paganism and nebulous philosophy and magic which he believes to have preceded all Christianity as the religion of
Erin	PERSON	and the Irish , and this particular form of belief has been unsparingly denounced by the
Church	ORGANIZATION	and its votaries .

		It must always be borne in mind , there - fore , that the several episodes in the young mys - tic 's work wherein the powers of black magic are shown in triumph over the utmost spiritual safe - guards the
Church	ORGANIZATION	throws about its children have brought upon him the final condemnation of its authorities and caused his utter repudiation as an interpretive force by the overwhelming major - ity of his own countrjTnen .

		214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	^ The ethics of modern business and public life .

		It is no bad sign of the times that as partisan rancor disap - pears the fame of the late Gov - ernor
Altgeld	LOCATION	shines more and more clearly -- ' a good deed in a naughty world . '

		His life , and his last -LRB- posthumous -RRB- work to be given to the public , ' The Cost of Something for
Noth	PERSON	- ing ' -LRB-
Hammersmark Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , exemplify admirably the pithy saying , ' Practice before you preach . '

		For his life is now understood to have been , especially in its more public aspects , a long devotion to duty and to cleai ` ly conceived ideals ; and this little book is a homily on the text , ' Filthy lucre is the root of all evil . '

		Those famil - iar with the details of Governor
Altgeld	LOCATION	's polit - ical career recall in this connection that , like
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, he went into public life a rich man and came out a poor one , -- and that , too , after the fully authenticated rejection of the most enonnous bribes ever offered a public servant .

		It may be conceded at the outset that the book contains nothing new ; ethical systems have changed little in historic time , and there is little to be said by any of the world 's teachers that has not been said before .

		But there is always tlie application of ancient principles to modern instances ; and it is here that * The Cost of Some - thing for Nothing ' obtains distinction .

		Speak - ing from the fulness of exj > erience , w ^ riting after the sweets of power had been tried and found bitter , yet animated by a steadfast belief in the ultimate goodness of humankind , the author dis - cusses nearly every aspect of American life , -- private , criminal , political , coiporate , clerical , judicial , journalistic , feminine , militant , or other , -- with a pointedness and shrewdness that will permit few of his readers to lay all their respon - sibility for existing abuses upon the shoulders of others .

		Doing this , he has unquestionably laid himself open to a charge of i3essimism ; but the appeal throughout the book is so openly an appeal from what is worst to what is best in human nature , so convincingly based on the assurance that such appeals are not made in vain , that the charge must fall .

		Indeed , on the other hand , the book displays so firm a conviction that all wrong 's die ' as of self-slaughter , ' that more than one of us find it almost too unreasonably optimis - tic , too bold in its assumption of acquaintance with the mighty laws by which man 's place in the universe is established .

		The book is compact and easily read , and must take its place with the best of those dealing with practical ethics as applied to the problems of modern life .

		A new and thoroughly revised scientific studies ^ • ^ - f ^
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	's of men and women .

		, .

		.

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ '' / o - i \ ' Man and Woman ' -LRB- Scnbner -RRB- serves to call attention to the great importance of this book ,
Avhieh	PERSON	may almost be said to lie at the foundation of a new science , that of human sex , considered separately as a branch of anthrop - ology , archaeology , physiology , and sociology .

		The first edition of this work made its appeai-ance just ten years ago .

		It was remarkable both for what it exhibited in the way of scientific achieve - ment within the limits laid down , and for the wide gaps in knowledge which it showed to exist between the ascertained series of facts .

		The remarkably stimulating character of the work finds its proof in the new matter which Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	has been able to add to this the foui ` th edition of the book .

		Many of the gaps have been ade - quately closed , and in none is the lack of study and research wholly appai-ent .

		The author 's speculations have been uniformly accorded atten - tion by the great body of specialists engaged on the topic ; and Avhile a few of these speculations have been shoAvn to be defective , a larger niunber have been supported by the results of investiga - tions painstakingly cai'iied on .

		Some of the ideas , such as that of the infeiior brain capacity of Avomankind , have been dismissed into the realm of mere suppositions , -- quite in the man - ner of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's overthrow of the supposed fact that women had fewer teeth than men , brought about by the sufficiently simple device of count - ing the teeth .

		What remains as established , or on the way to become established , can be read with profit by every member of both sexes who has arrived at an understanding age , -- by par - ents , and by employers , especially the employers of women .

		The scientific men and women of the
United States	LOCATION	have especial cause for pride in the part they have borne in these recent investi - gations ; and in their results , as giving Ameri - cans certain physical supremacies over the rest of the civilized Avorld , the entire nation may take delight .

		Granted that a nobly born Chinese diplomatist educated in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	has the usual point of view of the American bourgeois , and that it is possible to explain in the Chinese language the point and savor of American jests of the school of Senator
Depew	PERSON	, there is little in ' As a Chinaman Saw Us ' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- to refute the assertion made by the ' editor , ' Mr.
Henry Pearson Gratton	PERSON	, in his preface , that ' The selections have been made from a series of letters covering a decade spent in America. , and were addressed to a friend in
China	LOCATION	who had seen few foreigners . '

		The contents display something of the contempt Avhich every person reared under a civilization that has seen all the historic empires of the world , from
Egypt	LOCATION	to
Spain	LOCATION	, pass awaj ^ and leave it flourishing , must feel for American self-assertive - ness and bustle ; but they fail almost wholly in the expression of the deep-rooted aversion every Chinaman is known to feel for militarism , -- the national point of view that sets down the profes - sional soldier or sailor on a ship-of-war as a hired assassin , to be treated by him as a respect - able Chi-istian treats a convicted murderer when brought into personal contact with him .

		This , and the rest , suffice to make it more than doubtful Avhether a Chinaman ever phrased any of the sen - timents here attributed to him ; nevertheless the book has enough of truth and discrimination to make it a valid if not a thorough arraignment of American manners , morals , and characteristics .

		Represented as a diplomatist , and so given the entree to the ' best ' American society , the crit - icism resulting must Jbring delight to the envious I ones Avho are without the charmed portal of -1 merica through Chinese spectacles .

		THE DIAL 216 The diary of a child of genius .

		* society , ' and suffices to entitle the author to be called an ' anarchist ' by those assailed .

		The book is bright and uniformly readable .

		A picture of the incorrigibility of genius , -- a picture of the soul of an artist , ' naively un - conscious of the limitations imposed upon life by some of us Avho are not geniuses , ' -- a record of a life characterized by passionate irresponsibility , such is ' The Diarj ^ of a Musician ' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Miss
Dolores M. Bacon	PERSON	.

		From the grinding pov - ertj ' ^ of a Hungarian farm , through his musical training as a violinist at
Prague	LOCATION	and his introduc - tion to the world as a public favorite , this diary is a recognition of the ' unknown ' musician 's genius , -- the fruit of whatever was bizarre or melodramatic in his career .

		His vices , quarrels , desperate straits , ardent and sometimes simul - taneous love-affaii-s , afford great resources for the cai'eful editor , who has reason to be grateful for a subject that did not dwell in the realms of the commoni : -RRB- lace forever .

		There is a certain streak of humor running through the diary , yet one feels that each jest carries a sting .

		Genius is said to be incorrigible , and many Avill imagine they are here reading autobiography ; perhaps they are , -- but it is autobiog-raphy which , as
Coleridge	PERSON	said of history , has not only been popularized but plebifieated .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		k ' A Primer of Physiolog -RCB- ' ^ , ' by Mr.
E. H. Starling	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has the extreme merit of being free from the irrelevant paragraphs about the use of narcotics which disfigure most books of its class , a fact accounted for by its English origin . '

		Machiavelli and the
Modern State	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
Louis Dyer	PERSON	, is a volume containing three lectures given in
1899	DATE	at the Eoyal Institution .

		Their respective subjects are ' The Prince , '
Machiavelli	PERSON	as a historian , and
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	as a moralist .

		The numerous quotations are given in the original .

		The central idea of the work is that we should judge
Machiavelli	PERSON	by the whole of his writings , and not , as is so frequently done , by ' The Prince ' alone .

		The book is of much interest , and , although popu - lar in manner , is based upon a scholarly study of the subject .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Since we noticed the first instalment of the * Unit Books ' published by Mr.
Howard Wilford Bell	PERSON	, we have been awaiting with interest additions to the collection .

		Three such additions are now at hand :
Eenan	ORGANIZATION	's * Life of Jesus , ' Mrs.
Trollops	PERSON	's ' Domestic Manners of the Americans , ' and an extremely useful and well edited volume of '
National Documents	ORGANIZATION	. '

		These titles speak for themselves ; it remains for us to say of the books that they are supplied with editorial matter of a helpful sort , that they are very pleasant books to handle and read , and that they are to be had at extremely reasonable prices .

		This enterprise is so praiseworthy that M ' e wish it every success , and trust that the rate of publication may be rapidly accelerated .

		The list of titles announced for future publication includes many works that , in this inexpensive and tasteful form , will prove a boon to the public .

		An
Oxford India Paj	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- er edition of
Dickens	PERSON	's ' Christmas Books , ' in five tiny volumes weighing together less than two ounces , is announced by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	. '

		A Dog 's Tale , ' by
Mark Twain	PERSON	, is a republica - tion , in the form of a thin volume , of the story recently printed in one of the popular magazines .

		It comes from
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		A volume of ' Eetrospects ' by Professor
William Knight	PERSON	, made up largely of personal reminiscences of notable English men and women of the Victorian era , will be published at an early date by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		An account of the
` Last Hours of Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's Cavalry , ' covering the operations of
Sheridan	PERSON	and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	after the fall of
Petersburg	LOCATION	and Eichmond , has been written by Brig.-Gen .

		Henry
Edwin Tre	PERSON	- main , and will be published shortly by Messrs.
Bon	PERSON	- nell ,
Silver & Bowers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The feature of chief interest in ' The Printing Art ' for
September	DATE	is Mr.
Theodore L. De Vinne	PERSON	's article on ' The Sizes of Books , ' in which he dis - cusses the hap-hazard and conflicting terms now in general use .

		It is a paper that publishers and libra - rians would do well to ponder carefully .

		Three tales by
Eobert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	-- ' The Story of a Lie , ' ' The Misadventures of
John Nicholson	PERSON	, ' and * The Body Snatcher , ' -- all hith - erto inaccessible outside the subscription editions , have been brought together as a new volume in
Messrs. H. B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's pretty reprint of
Stevenson	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Among the books on Mr.
Eobert Grier Cooke	PERSON	's Autumn list may be mentioned ' Six Incursions by a
Predatory Pew	ORGANIZATION	into Some Theologic Fastnesses , ' by
Edward Augustus Jenks	PERSON	, A. M. ; ' Captain
Kidd	PERSON	and Other Charades , ' by Miss
Florence L. Sohler	PERSON	; '
Barclay Genealogies	PERSON	, ' by Mr.
E. Burnham Mof	PERSON	- fat ; and ' The Eoosevelt Doctrine , ' compiled by Mr.
E. E. Garrison	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	is about to publish a limited edition , in two volumes , of an exact facsimile of the original English edition of the * German Popu - lar Stories ' Collected by the brothers
Grimm	PERSON	.

		All the illustrations by
George Cruikshank	PERSON	which appeared in the First and Second Series of the stories , issued in
1823	DATE	and
1826	DATE	respectively , will be included , and printed from the original plates .

		Under the general title of ' Life Stories for
Young People	ORGANIZATION	,
' Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will pub - lish shortly translations from the German of the lives of
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , and
William Tell	ORGANIZATION	, written in story form for juvenile readers .

		The Germans excel in this sort of writing , and the series should find hearty favor with American chil - dren .

		The work of translation has been done by Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	.

		For some time past there have been indications of a marked revival of interest in
Eossetti	LOCATION	and his work .

		Last Fall no less than three complete edi - tions of the Poems were published , all produced in more or less elaborate and expensive form .

		A few months ago Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's volume gave Eossetti place in the select company of the ' English Men of Letters ' series ; and we have just now had Mr.
Treffry Dunn	PERSON	's slender sheaf of * Eecollections ' of tho poet and his Cheyne Walk circle .

		In addition to a reprint of ' The Early Italian Poets ' in the ' Temple Classics ' series , the .

		present
Autumn	DATE	sea - son will bring at least two new editions of the com - plete Poems .

		One of these is in the Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	's excellent inexpensive editions of the poets , 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, witli the editorial matter of Mr ,
W. M. Eossetti	PERSON	.

		The other is an edition de luxe in two volumes , printed on hand-made paper and illustrated with twenty photogravures from
Rossetti	PERSON	's paintings .

		This also will contain his brother 's notes , and will be published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. '

		A
Seventeenth Century Anthology	ORGANIZATION	, ' compiled and edited by Mrs.
Alice Meynell	PERSON	, is sent us by the
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	as a specimen volume in their ' Red Letter Library , ' a successful English series that has now found its way across the water .

		The book is of pocket size , well printed on soft paper , and prettily bound in crimson leather .

		The head-lines in red ink on each page give a distinctive touch , and presumably provide the basis for the name of the series .

		Twenty volumes are now ready , nearly half of which consist of Mrs.
Mey	PERSON	- nell 's selections from the poets .

		The other titles have introductions by critics of such note as Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, Professor

		OXFORD
MO DERN FR ENCH	PERSON	SERIES The Delegates of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	have for some time believed that , among the many series of annotated French texts now being issued , there was still room for a series to be chosen from the best modern French writers who have already attained to the rank of classics : writers such as
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Gautier	PERSON	, de
Tocqueville	LOCATION	,
Taine	PERSON	.

		This series which the Delegates are beginning to publish consists not only of romances and short stories , but embraces also narratives of travel , biographies , and essays .

		The series is intended primarily for students who have advanced some little way in their knowledge of the French langmage , and do not need an explanation of every idiom or phrase somewhat out of the common ; the notes therefore deal mainly with points of literary or historical interest .

		They have been supplied for each volume by teachers and persons of wide experience in education .

		The texts have all been very carefully selected with the hope that this series may commend itself not only to school - masters , but also to parents and others who wish those under their charge to read good modem French books , and have hitherto not known what books could be put into their hands with absolute safety .

		The series is under the general editorship of Mr.
Leon Delbos	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Instructor in French in
H. M. S. Britannia	LOCATION	.

Querido	PERSON	's ' Human Woe ' is a * tale of the sufferings of poor labourers and gardeners who live in filth and misery ; ' Mr.
Heyerman	PERSON	's ' Diamantstad ' deals with a strike of diamond - workers ; Mr.
J. Steynen	PERSON	, in hi.s ' Proletariers , ' depicts the lives of people ` eat - ing Just enough not to starve ; ' Mr.
J. Everts	PERSON	, in `
Klein Leven	PERSON	, ' dwells on ` the life of the unemployed , of peasants , and on low life gen - erally ; ' and Mr.
van Hulsen	PERSON	has begun a series of novels ` in which he is going to depict the lives of the outcasts of society . '

		This seems a rather depressing programme for a year 's lit - erary output , but it is relieved by mention of a few works that belong to other categories .

		Among these may be named '
Jacoba van Bei	PERSON	- eren , ' a poem by Mr.
Albert Yerwey	PERSON	, which takes us back to the middle ages ; Mr.
L. H. A. Drabbe	PERSON	's '
Ernst Gronins	PERSON	, ' the story of a high - school boy , and one of the best novels of the year ; the weird ' God en
Goden	ORGANIZATION	' of Mr.
Louis Couperus	PERSON	, in which the ' author seems to have soared too near the sun , ' with the traditional consequences ; and Dr.
Frederik van Eeden	PERSON	's ` The Happy World , ' in which ` we find Tols - toy 's self-denial and
William Morris	ORGANIZATION	's skill combined with the far-sightedness of a psychol - ogist of great experience and of a man who himself puts his prescriptions into practice . '

		A number of works reported in this paper have already been spoken of as included in Professor FTedericq 's account of Belgian literature .

Oct.	DATE	.

		U ,
Miss Eosika Schwimmer	PERSON	writes from Hun - gary and compares the literature of the past year to ' a pretty piece of mosaic composed of tiny stones , more or less brightly coloured . '

		The place of honor is given to
Jokai	PERSON	's last romance , * Where Money Is Not Everything , ' which is described as ' a fantastic story , displaying many of the brilliant qualities of our prince of romancers , who has died at a ripe old age indeed , and yet all too prematurely , for he has taken with him to the grave the plans for many a book that he might have written . '

		Other fiction includes ' Cloudy Problems , ' a novel of the woman question by the political writer , Mr.
Gustav Beksics	PERSON	; ' Tar jan Denes , ' a story of the
Faubourg St. Leopold	ORGANIZATION	in
Budapest	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Dezso Balazs	PERSON	; ' Fruitless Struggles , ' by Mr.
Paul Wolfner	PERSON	; and ` The Outcasts , ' by Mr.
Jeno Heltai	PERSON	, which ' describes in a very modem fashion how one may be redeemed from the moral degradation of cheating at play . '

		In poetry .

		Miss
Renee Erdos	PERSON	has produced ' Woman and Her Companion , ' which ' has almost nothing to commend it save the sonorous beauty of its language , ' and the lyric romance , ' Cleopatra , ' which is ' a gem of its kind . '

		The greatest dramatic triumph of the year has been achieved by the ' Darkness ' of Mr.
Max Kothauser	PERSON	, a play aimed at the absurdities of dueling .

		Mr.
Zoltan Bosnyak	PERSON	's '
Sursum Corda	PERSON	' is an event , ' not only because a high State offi - cial has here brought upon the conservative stage of the ISTational Theatre the '
Marseil	PERSON	- laise ' and the ' Kol-Nidre ' -- a synagogal chant of the Jews -- side by side , but also because it expresses a distinctly socialistic idea . '

		` The King 's Bride , ' by Mr.
Imre Foldes	PERSON	, is the work of a boy of twenty , who has won four academic prizes within the
last three years	DATE	.

		Mr.
Franz Herczeg	PERSON	's ' Byzantium , ' ' a tragedy of deca - dence , is a magnificent composition , vigorously drawn and richly coloured , and will retain a permanent place on our stage . '

		The most impor - tant work in general literature appears to be Mr.
Karl Eotvos	PERSON	's history of the superstition regarding ritual murders by the Jews .

		It is a three-volume work , entitled ' The Great Law - suit That Has Lasted a Thousand Years , and Is Not Finished Yet . '

		Dr.
Biagi	PERSON	's Italian contribution is almost impossible to summarize , for the reason that it is little more than a swollen catalogue of names and titles . '

		I have chosen , ' he says , ' to inves - tigate and analyze the whole bibliographical production of this year , compiling long notes of names and titles , for fear that there might escape my view some volume worthy of notice . '

		He has done this so relentlessly as almost to for - bid selection on our part .


Signor d'Annunzio	PERSON	's drama , ' La Figlia di Jorio , ' is the one unques - tioned masterpiece of the year , and its great success makes comment unnecessary .

		The poet has also produced another volume of his '
Laudi	PERSON	, ' ' in which are displayed the highest qualities of his genius , which ever aspires after new creations , and moulds them in verse . '

		The remaining poetry of the year includes
Signora Negri	PERSON	's ' Maternita , ' and
Signor Luigi Orsini	PERSON	's ` Dall '
Alba	PERSON	al
Tramonto	PERSON	' and ` II
Canne di Homagna	ORGANIZATION	. '

		A certain '
Giulio Orsini	PERSON	' has also come forward with ' Fra Terra ed
Astri	PERSON	, ' a vol - ume of verses ' acclaimed by all as a revelation . '

		^ It turned out , after the excitement was well under way , tliat the new poet was no youthful singer , but the veteran
Signor Domenico Gnoli	PERSON	, ' a white-bearded bard of sixty-five sum - mers . '

		The theatrical productions of the year count as the most noteworthy
Signor Oriani	PERSON	's tragedy , ' L'Invincible , '
Signor Butti	PERSON	's ' Gi - ganti e Pigmei , ' and
Signor Bracco	PERSON	's ' Mater - nita , ' in which ' a woman , in order to free her - self from her husband , accuses herself of hav - ing a lover . '

		Nothing of particular significance in fiction seems to have appeared : a few ran - dom titles are '
Gli Ammonitori	PERSON	, ' a romance a la
Gorki	LOCATION	, by
Signor Cena	PERSON	; '
Nella Vita	PERSON	, ' by
Signor Salvatore di Giacomo	PERSON	; '
Una Passione	LOCATION	, ' by
Signor Neera	PERSON	; and
' 11	DATE
Cavallo di Troja	ORGANIZATION	, ' by
Signor Ugo Ojetti	PERSON	.

		Apart from these belletris - tic categories , we find few books deserving to be singled out ; among these few may be men - tioned
Signor Pompeo Molmenti	PERSON	's work on ' Venetian Art , '
Signor Achille Loria	PERSON	's ' Verso la
Giustizia Sociale	LOCATION	, '
Signor Giovanni Venos	PERSON	- ta 's '
Ricordi	PERSON	di Gioventu , ' and Senator Pier
Desiderio	PERSON	's '
Gli Anni Secolari	PERSON	, ' in which the author , ` As in an historical vision , has attempted to pass in review the bygone centuries , and has done it with a profound knowledge of the character of each age , and in a critical spirit , caustic and highly original , that give to these pages a peculiar attractiveness . '

		The recently published '
Epistolario	PERSON	' of Giu - seppe
Giusti	PERSON	presents the poet in a new and more life-like light than heretofore .

		The Petrarch celebration has called forth much interesting matter relating to the first of the great humanists .

		Three works in Polish literature are singled out from the mass by Dr.
Belcikowski	PERSON	, and these alone we will mention .

		One of them is Mr.
J. Zulawski	PERSON	's play , ` Eros and Psyche , ' ' a kind of epic in dialogue ... distinguished by excellent versification . '

		The two others are novels : ' Ashes , ' by Mr.
S. Zeromski	PERSON	, and ' The Peasants , ' by Mr.
W. Raymont	PERSON	.

		The action of ' Ashes ' passes ' in the period which begins with the last partition of
Poland	LOCATION	and closes with the fall of

		THE DIAL .

		227 Legions / In ' The Peasants ' the ' descrip - tions of natural scenery are of extraordinary beauty , the manners and customs of the village folk are picturesquely and charmingly sketched , and from this background emerge the figures of lifelike men and women , who undoubtedly reflect the character of the Polish peasant more truthfully than any of our former romances of this class have succeeded in doing / In
Eussia	LOCATION	, according to Mr.
Briusov	PERSON	, the most important publication of the year is ' The Life of
Vasilii Febeicki	PERSON	, ' a tale by Mr.
Leonide Andreev	PERSON	. '

		This is the history of a poor village priest , who sees around him only misery , and who is himself destined to experience all forms of human unhappiness . '

		Mr.
Merezhkovski	PERSON	has begun the publication of '
Peter	PERSON	and
Alexis	PERSON	, ' which is the third division of his great trilogy , * Christ and Antichrist , ' already widely known to English readers .

		Two small tales by
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	are chronicled , as also unimportant stories by Mr.
Chekhov	PERSON	, Mr.
Boborykine	PERSON	, Mr.
Korolenko	PERSON	, and '
Gorki	PERSON	. '

		Professor K. Bal - mont , who is called ' the most conspicuous of contemporary Eussian poets , ' has published two collections of verse , * Let Us Be Like the Sun , ' and ' Only Love . '

		Mr.
Chekhov	PERSON	's ' The Cherry Garden ' is the only noteworthy play of the year .

		It gives ' a series of pictures of the life of the Eussian squirearchy painted in a masterly way and of types drawn straight from nature . '

		A great many other books are mentioned , but it would be invidious to select from them .

		The death of
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	this
summer	DATE	has been the greatest of literary losses .

		The war has nat - urally retarded literary activities , and , strange to say , has produced little or no valuable special literature of its own .

		Don
Eafael Altamera	PERSON	writes , as usual , a lengthy review of Spanish literature , but it is little more than a catalogue , and presents but few items which seem to us deserving of repro - duction .

		The new play of
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	, * La Desequilibrada , ' was not a success , but the two new plays of
Seiior Galdos	PERSON	, *
Mariucha	PERSON	' and ` El Abuelo ' , were enthusiastically ap - plauded by the public .

		The former deals with * the value of the will to work in life , while it censures the thirst for luxury and for ostenta - tious display ' ; the latter * presents firmly the psychological problem of family honour and the rigid conception of legitimate birth , '
Senor Galdos	PERSON	has also achieved success with his romance of * The Eevolution of
July	DATE	, ' a new volume in his ' Episodios Nacionales . '

		These are the works of chief interest in Spanish hetles lettres , and space is lacking for us to enumerate the important works in other depart - ments of literature .

		FILIPINO SONGS AND MUSIC . '

		No , ' said the old Mlipina sadly , * the Ameri - cano ladies do not care for music .

		They are not like the Spanish or Filipino ladies . '

		And she shook her head again , still more dolefully , and walked off to another part of the little music - store on
Calle Carriedo	PERSON	.

		It was something to think about , this strange announcement from a woman of what is popu - larly supposed to be one of the most musical races in the world to-day ; and on investigation the answer proved to be as simple as the old native woman 's belief in her statement .

		The truth of the matter is that the Filipinos , whether they be cultured Visayan or savage
Bagobo	LOCATION	, Tinguian or Igorrote dog-eater , have a keenly developed sense of metre and rhythm , a quick ear , and small regard for such a minor thing as harmony .

		Beyond that , the Filipino does not amount to much in a musical way , though he has a traditive music that is worthy of passing notice .

		Away back in the latter part of the sixteenth century , when the valiant knights and priests of old
Spain	LOCATION	came to the newly acquired archi - pelago , they found a sort of lyric drama which interested their scholars greatly , and many a portly and comfortable Spanish tome , now yellow and full of the traces of the Philippine book - worm , lies at peace on monastery shelves in
Manila	LOCATION	, ready to tell the inquirer , in its quaint ancient speech , of what musical conditions were at that early stage in the history of the now famous islands .

		Parchment after parchment is to be found among the priceless archives of the Augustinian and other religious monastic orders , giving details of poem and song and chant .

		Full of interest are these old stories , some of them with over three hundred years of dust and mil - dew upon them , others written in comparatively recent years , and still full of fire .

		All of them agree upon one point only , -- that among the natives of that day there were many who made excellent choristers and wrote very acceptable music and songs under the direction and supervi - sion of the Spanish friars who had the advantage of a musical training .

		Beyond that , most of the manuscripts differ widely in their estimates of the work of the natives ; and while most of them declare pointedly that there was no writ - ten music of any kind whatsoever , others are silent on this point , and still others are so expressed as to leave the matter suppositional , with perhaps a hint of something that has not been found .

		When
Delgado	PERSON	, the old historian , wrote his famous Philippine history , he made a strong argument in favor of the destruction of the old native books by the priests , because the people needed to be evangelized , and the best way to do it was to eradicate any of their old heathen prac - tices that might still exist , by burning up their books .

		Accordingly , the priests throughout the islands gathered together all the old books they 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, could lay their hands on and piled them up in the great square in the centre of each pueblo or town , and burned them to ashes .

		These books , it may be said incidentally , were made in a most curious manner .

		The material was a sort of dried palm-leaf , prepared so as to be solid and enduring without being brittle , and to a great extent resembling the Egyptian papyrus .

		The writing was done while the leaves were still soft and flexible , with a sharp stylus , and the leaves were pasted together , furnished with wooden or bark covers , and the whole put away to dry .

		As the friars have left no very clear accounts of these early manuscripts -LRB- for such they were -RRB- , we are at a loss to know just how much of them was religious , how much musical , legal , or historical ; but the best authorities on Philippine matters of ancient times agree that the zeal of the priests was a mistake of the greatest importance to the musical and literary world , as those quaint volumes , -- which opened like a fan , the right edge of one leaf being attached to the left of its fellow , -- may have con - tained data , or notes at least , which would have been of the utmost use in solving several of the problems which beset the ethnographer in his work to-day .

		Some of the old accounts are amusing in their religious fervor and seriousness ; and one old friar , the celebrated
Padre Colin	LOCATION	, a Jesuit scholar , wrote : ` All that they have is founded on tradi - tion , handed down from father to son , conserved by its use , and in certain songs , which they hold only in memory , and repeat in their naviga - tion , to the sweep of the oar , and in their merry - makings , fiestas , mortuary services , and even in their labors , when they come much together .

		In these songs they recount the fabulous genealo - gies and vain deeds of their gods . '

		One of the songs most liked by the natives is the famous Lam-ang , which has survived to the present .

		Another very curious song , whose shortness is puzzling , considei'ing the characteristics of the natives , is to be found up in the northern part of
Luzon	LOCATION	, in the Uocos provinces , particularly in
North Ilocos	LOCATION	.

		This old song is addressed to the ' mangmangkik ' or ` anitos ' of the trees .

		An ` anito ' is a sort of reincarnate spirit of some dead ancestor , and his habitat is fixed according to whatever the need may be in the spirit world at the time he becomes a spirit .

		Some * mangmang - kik ' are declared to be in charge of the forests , and must be propitiated by the woodsmen before cutting any timber , so the custom is to chant or intone the following .

		I give both the Ilocano dialect , and its practical equivalent in English : Barf , barl !

		Dika agufiget pari Ta pumukan kamt
Iti	ORGANIZATION	pabakirda kadakaml .

		In English there is no possible translation for
Bari	ORGANIZATION	,
Bari	LOCATION	, which is an Ilocano interjection in common use in such compositions .

		The rest of the stanza goes :
Bari	ORGANIZATION	, bari !

		Annoy us not , godfather -LRB- friend -RRB- , For we cut only that which They command us .

		This address to the guardian spirit of the tree had to be made before the cutting was done , as , accord - ing to the vulgar Ilocano belief , says
Reyes	PERSON	, the ` anitos ' or ' mangmangkik ' are easily offended , have the power of vengeance to a great degree , and can afflict their human enemies with very grave infirmities if the latter trans - gress .

		Based on this song and superstition is a stoiy , written for the last Filipino exposition in
Madrid	LOCATION	, in which there appears to the hero of the tale a ' mangmangkik ' in human shape , when the former was attempting to cut down a tree with - out having first appeased the demigod .

		Other songs are sung to this day among the natives of
Leyte	LOCATION	,
Samar	PERSON	,
Mindoro	LOCATION	, and others of the islands in the
Visayan	LOCATION	section of the archi - pelago , and relate , to a certain extent , as in the days of
Colin	LOCATION	, the ` vain deeds ' of the old gods , mixed with curious references to semi-European lords and chiefs , and the whole twisted into a fantastic sort of appeal to the particular god whose domain the singer is traversing at the time .

		In
Mindanao	LOCATION	, the Moros ,
Bagobos	LOCATION	, and others , have a sort of war-chant which they use to screw their courage up to the sticking-point ; while in the farther islands priests of the various orders have discovered some other curious and interesting relics of the age of rhythm , which has not yet entirely disappeared .

		In their modem music , the Filipinos are not particularly happy in conception or execution .

		Their music is either a hodge-podge of stealings , jerky or uncertain in time , without solid motive , and lacking in originality , or else it is a simply rhythmic production , a series of semi-harmonic and almost distinct musical stanzas , connected , like the parts of a medley , by excuses .

		As for their execution of what is good , the writer has seen time after time in the best theatre in
Manila	LOCATION	, conversation going on steadily between various members of the orchestra during a piece ; some of the players would work with their eyes shut , and dreamily scrape away , a cigarette tucked behind a convenient ear ready for instant use ^ and a generally bored expression indicating lassi - tude and a desire to get out , -- though that same band will parade all over town and play eighteen hours at a stretch the night before
Christmas	DATE	or New Year 's , passing the begging hat steadily to sleepy , angry citizens in bed .

		The
Conway Autobiography	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	once said to a friend , ' You and I have spent many of the best years of our lives merely clearing theological rubbish out of our paths . '

		That friend ^ s autobiography , which is about to be published , is the record of this clear - ing-away of theological and other rubbish , -- a labor that every earnest soul is bound to under - take in the effort to find itself .

		That the record in the present instance is well worth the read - ing , no one at all familiar with Mr.
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	's life and writings will for a moment • doubt .

		Belonging to a Methodist slave-holding family of
Virginia	LOCATION	, he had to encounter bitter opposition from those nearest and dearest to ■ him before he succeeded in shaking off the tram - mels that fettered his freedom of growth .

		After graduating at a very early age from
Dickinson College	ORGANIZATION	, he essayed journalism with • considerable success , and then rode the circuit two years as a Methodist preacher .

		Then , not jet twenty-one years old and still groping for light , the versatile youth severed his church and family ties and made his way to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where he entered the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's writings that had opened his ■ eyes to the spiritual realities , and to him he had written confessing his doubtings and question - ings .

		An answer came , sage and sympathetic , admirable for its wise restraint and careful Tiandling of delicate matters .

		The closing para - graph is as follows : ' I am interested by your kind interest in my writ - ings , but you have not let me sufficiently into your - own habit of thought , to enable me to speak to it with much precision .

		But I believe what interests `` both you and me most of all things , and whether we know it or not , is the morals of intellect ; in other words , that no man is worth his room in the world who is not commanded by a legitimate object of thought .

		The earth is full of frivolous people , who are bending their whole force and the force of nations on trifles , and these are baptized with every grand and holy name , remaining , of course , totally inadequate to occupy any mind ; and so sceptics are made .

		A true soul will disdain to be moved except by what natively commands it , though it should go sad and solitary in search of its master a thou - sand years .

		The few superior persons in each com - munity are so by their steadiness to reality and their neglect of appearances .

		This is the euphrasy and rue that purge the intellect and ensure insight .

		Its full rewards are slow but sure ; and yet I think it has its reward on the instant , inasmuch as sim - plicity and grandeur are always better than dap - perness .

		But I will not spin out these saws farther , but hasten to thank you for your frank and friendly letter , and to wish you the best deliverance in that contest to which every soul must go alone . '

Daniel Conway	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		At
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's house and among
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's
Concord	LOCATION	friends the young divinity student spent many delightful hours , the record of which will be to not a few readers the best part of the ' Autobiography . '

		From the fresh glimpses it gives of the
New England	LOCATION	immor - tals must be taken this delightful bit of conver - sation between
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	and Alcott : ` There was at
Concord	LOCATION	a course of lectures every year , one of which was given by
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	.

		His com - ing was an important event .

		He was always a guest of the Emersons , where the literary people of the village were able to meet him .

		On one such occa - sion I remember listening to a curious conversa - tion between
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	and
A. Bronson Alcott	PERSON	, -- who lived and moved in a waking dream .

		After delight - ing Agassiz by repudiating the theory of the development of man from animals , he filled the pro- fessor with dismay by equally decrying the idea that God could ever have created ferocious and poi - sonous beasts .

		When Agassiz asked who could have created them ,
Alcott	PERSON	said they were the various forms of human sin .

		Man was the first being created .

		And the horrible creatures were originated by his lusts and animalisms .

		When
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, bewil - dered , urged that geology proved that the animals existed before man ,
Alcott	PERSON	suggested that man might have originated them before his appearance in his present form .

		Agassiz having given a signal of distress ,
Emerson	PERSON	came to the rescue with some reconciling discourse on the development of life and thought , with which the professor had to be content . '

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's father , a well-to-do manufac - turer , could not conscientiously give his son either moral or pecuniary support in a course that seemed to him so full of error , and the young man was consequently straitened for means and somewhat dependent on northern friends and sympathizers .

		A letter from the father to his son when the latter was called in
1854	DATE	to his first parish , the Unitarian church in
Washington	LOCATION	, will convey an idea of the oppo - sition the young clergyman had to withstand from those whose unsympathetic attitude must have caused him the deepest anguish . '

		You say in your last it is strange that you ' * meet with intolerance nowhere but at home . ''

		If you had but a small amount of that best of all sense -- common sense -- it would not seem at all strange that such should be the fact .

		I should treat all young men similarly situated just as you are treated by others -- but their parents and best friends would probably do towards them just as your parents and friends do towards you .

		A single moment 's reflec - tion would teach any common-sense person the rea - sonable propriety of our course .

		But having exhausted all our rational effort , we hand you over to the mercy of God , through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , and pray most earnestly that the ever - blessed Spirit may guide you aright .

		If you make shipwreck in this life and the next , you must not only wade through the precious blood of Christ and do despite to the Spirit of His grace -- but your father 's prayers , so long as his life lasts , will be thrown in the way also . '

		The
Washington	LOCATION	pastorate was a short one .

		To the young minister , a recent convert from pro-slavery sentiments , the wrongs of the negro 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, seemed to be the cause most urgently demand - ing his championship ; and because he refused to exclude the subject from his sermons he was dismissed from his pulpit after a two-years ' occupancy .

		But a call to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	very soon followed , and there he enjoyed greater freedom of speech .

		Not on slavery alone did he pro- nounce himself with emphasis , but on all sub - jects that seemed to him profitable for discus - sion .

		Thus it was that he became the defender of the stage at a time when , and in a com - munity where , all ministers of religion were expected to use their influence against the thea - tre .

		` Eegarding that institution as one of the most important for the culture of the community , I gave a discourse on this subject -LRB-
June 7 , 1857	DATE	-RRB- , compar - ing the clerical enemies of the theatre to
Jonah	PERSON	demanding the destruction of
Nineveh	LOCATION	.

		The subject of my discourse having been as usual announced in the papers , a large audience came ; it was said that every actor and manager was present .

		The discourse was published in pamphlet form and widely circulated .

		I became thenceforth a sort of chaplain to the actors , conducting their marriages and funerals , and whenever I attended any theatre I was invited into a private box But the most important response received was a letter from my mother stating that the pamphlet on the theatre had been read aloud in the family by my father , who on closing it said , `` I am not prepared to object to one word in it . '' '

		Even as early as 1860 Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's interest in
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, whose biography he was to write and whose works he was to edit many years later , was an absorbing one .

		In a small society of so-called infidels in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	he heard enthusiastic eulogies of Paine and lis - tened to the exposure of the traditional calum - nies that had long made him an object of abhor - rence to the devout ; and in these flagrant mis - representations the young free-thinker believed he discovered a recrudescence of the old folk - lore about the Wandering Jew and about
Faust	LOCATION	.

		He was reminded of the saying that ` towers may be measured by the shadows they cast . '

		Surely , he said to himself , this man must have been a very Leviathan of f ree - thought ; and he began to study his life and works .

		The inune - diate result of these researches was an announce - ment ` That on
Paine	PERSON	's birthday ,
Jan. 29 , 1860	DATE	, the subject of my sermon would be
Thomas Paine	PERSON	.

		The church was crowded .

		I had feared that my pleading for Paine might excite some opposition in my congrega - tion , or at least some remonstrance on my impru - dence ; but instead of that I received next day a request to publish my discourse .

		It was signed by many eminent and wealthy citizens , some of whom did not belong to my congregation ; their letter and names were printed as the preface of the sermon , which bore the title : ``
Thomas Paine	PERSON	.

		A Celebra - tion , '' From that time the freethinkers frequented my church , and I arranged that there should be each week an evening of discussion with them .

		1 had gained their goodwill , and
Moreau	PERSON	, a leading writer of their faith , -- for it was a fervent faith , -- dedicated a volume to me as the first who had ever uttered from a pulpit any word favorable to
Paine	LOCATION	. '

		Another interesting episode of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	pastorate has to do with the brief but honorable life-history of the * Dial , ' a monthly magazine of the highest class , which lived just one year , the twelve months of
1860	DATE	.

		The founder and editor thus tells the story of its origin : ` My theological and philosophical heresies re - ported in the
Ohio	LOCATION	journals excited discussion far and near .

		The papers teemed with controversial letters , and a magazine became inevitable .

		Its first number appeared in
January , 1860	DATE	, bearing the title : `` The Dial : a monthly magazine for litera - ture , philosophy and religion .

		Horas non numero nisi serenas .

		Cincinnati : Office , No. 76 West 3rd Street .

		1860 . ''

		At the end of my prefatory word it was said : `` The Dial stands before you , the reader , a legitimation of the Spirit of the Age , which aspires to be free : free in thought , doubt , utterance , love and knowledge .

		It is , in our minds , symbolized not so much by the sun-clock in the yard , as by the floral dial of Lin - naeus , which recorded the advancing day by the opening of some flowers and the closing of others : it would report the Day of God as recorded in the unfolding of higher life and thought , and the clos - ing up of old superstitions and evils : it would be a Dial measuring time by growth .

		The magazine was well received , had a large subscription list , and numbered among its con - tributors

		A cordial greeting to the new paper was extended , anonymously , by Mr.

		But the temper of the times -- the stormy days of
1860	DATE	- 61 -- proved unfavorable to the continuation of the paper , and thus ended the brief course of the second of the three ' Dials ' that figure in our literary annals .

		In the
summer of 1863	DATE	Mr.
Conway	PERSON	accepted the offered editorship of the ' Commonwealth , ' a paper about to be started in
Boston	LOCATION	in the interest of immediate emancipation of the negro .

		He made his home in
Concord	LOCATION	, largely influenced , one can not but surmise , by the pros - pect of being near
Emerson	LOCATION	, after whom he had named a son .

		Of the appearance of this anti- slavery paper he says : ` The `` Commonwealth '' began with
September , 1862	DATE	.

		Frank B ,
Sanborn	PERSON	was associated with me in editing it .

		We were friends at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and he was the only student there who held
Emerson	LOCATION	in a reverence equal to my own .

		After graduation he had settled at
Concord	LOCATION	and we were in constant communication .

		We had a vigorous antislavery governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
John A. Andrew	PERSON	, who had protested against the use of soldiers from his State to return fugitive slaves .

		The `` Common - wealth '' was recognized as a sort of organ of the

Wendell Phillips	PERSON	. '

		In the
spring of 1863	DATE	Mr.
Conway	PERSON	went to
England	LOCATION	, his mission being to enlist English sympathy on the side of the North in our war , and to lecture and write with that end in view .

		Two letters a week were also to be sent home to the ' Commonwealth . '

		Of his English experiences , the many eminent persons he met , and the memorable things they said , lack of space forbids even the briefest account here .

		The English mission opened the way to his set - tlement , in
1864	DATE	, as minister of
South Place Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, a post which he retained for twenty years ; and even after that he still clung to his adopted home , so that now he is probably more often thought of as an Englishman than as an American .

		Of
Martineau	PERSON	the author has things of inter - est to say , and a comparison is drawn between him and
Emerson	PERSON	, two men whom one feels more inclined to contrast than to compare .

		Car - lyle also figures frequently in his pages , and many facts are related that help to explain the lamentable performance of the great man 's lite - rary executor .

		Froude , we are told , never really knew
Carlyle	PERSON	, and he rushed his biography and reminiscences into print in feverish alarm lest another 's pen , possibly Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's , should anticipate him , whereas the vast and perplexing mass of material on his hands should have occu - pied his best energies for many months in the sifting .

		Noteworthy evidence is given by our author of the domestic harmony enjoyed by
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife .

		Mrs.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	once said to Mr.
Conway	PERSON	, ' If uncle and aunt lived unhappily I never discovered it , none of their relatives knew it , and I am sure they did not know it themselves .

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	alone knows it . '

		One pleasing glimpse of our lamented Arte - mus

		`` Artemus the delicious , '' as
Charles Beade	PERSON	called him , came to
London	LOCATION	in
June , 1866	DATE	, and gave his `` piece '' in Egyptian Hall .

		The refined , deli - cate , intellectual countenance , the sweet , grave mouth from which one might have expected philo - sophical lectures , retained their seriousness while listeners were convulsed with laughter .

		There was something magical about it .

		Every sentence was a surprise .

		He played on his audience as
Liszt	PERSON	did on a piano -- most easily when most effectively .

		Who can ever forget his attempt to stop his Italian pianist -- * * a count in his own country , but not much account in this '' -- who went on playing loudly while he was trying to tell us an `` affecting inci - dent '' that occurred near a small clump of trees shown on his panorama of the far west .

		The music stormed on ; we could see only lips and arms pathet - ically moving , till the piano suddenly ceased , and we heard -- it was all we heard -- * ' and she fainted in

		His tricks have been attempted in many theatres , but
Artemus Ward	PERSON	was inimitable .

		And all the time the man was dying .

		Never was American in
London	LOCATION	so beloved When it was learned that the most delightful of men was wasting away under rapid consumption even while he was charming us , the grief was inex - pressible . '

		It is worth noting that of all the
London	LOCATION	clubs that have solicited Mr. Conwa/s member - ship , the one in which he has taJcen the liveliest interest is the
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is a true Omarite and , of course , an admirer of
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, in the rose-planting pil - grimage to whose grave he took part .

		* Then we went over to
Edward Clodd	ORGANIZATION	's country homestead at
Aldeburgh	LOCATION	, ''
Strafford House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and remained from that
Saturday	DATE	till
Monday	DATE	.

		Fill in from your imagination , my reader , the charm and beauty of this function and of our symposia at
Strafford	LOCATION	. '

		The latter half of the ' Autobiography , ' deal - ing chiefly with affairs in
England	LOCATION	and with English persons of note , contains hardly a dull page or paragraph ; but it .

		is the first part , the American part , depicting the author 's early struggles and growth , that will most interest him who seeks a better acquaintance with Mr.
Conway	PERSON	.

		Among the good causes he has been ever active to promote , there stands out as per - haps the one in which he has most earnestly exerted himself , the cause of peace , his horror of war having long ago prompted him to zeal - ous advocacy of the abolition of slavery by pur - chase .

		A larger , richer , truer life , chronicled with more wealth of detail and greater charm of simple , direct narration , embellished with timely anecdote , it would be hard to find .

		The writer 's memory appears to be an inexhaustible storehouse of reminiscences that can not fail to please .

		232 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, manifested in the organization of the '
Harri	PERSON	- man
Alaska	LOCATION	Expedition ' has been continued with a generosity that has spared no expense in the illustration and publication of the narra - tive of the voyage and of its scientific results in the best attainable form .

		The start was made in the publication , in
1901	DATE	, of the first two volumes devoted to the narrative of the expedition , and to papers of a literary nature and those treating of the less technical scientific subjects .

		These volumes were models of the printer 's art , and touched high-water mark in the field of illustration .

		The continuation of the work appears in the three handsome volumes on ' Glaciers , ' ' Geology , ' and * Cryptogamic Botany . '

		Others devoted to biological subjects will follow , and the finish is not yet in sight .

		These volumes are under the skilful editor - ship of Dr.
C. Hart Merriam	PERSON	, of the Biological Survey of the
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Of necessity they are composites , the work of many expert hands ; and some of the papers here combined in book form have previously appeared in the Proceedings of the
Washington Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, which col - laborated with the
Harriman Alaska Expedi	ORGANIZATION	- tion in the publication of its scientific results .

		For bibliographical purposes in citation , the original pagination is given , as well as that of the volume in which the reprinted papers are here published .

		Simplicity and directness stamp the editorial make-up of this series , in marked contrast with the cumbersome , confusing , and elaborate method of subdivision and designation adopted in some German Reports of scientific expeditions .

		In paper , typography , illustra - tions , and binding , these volumes leave nothing to be desired by the most fastidious lover of fine books ; while at the same time there is noth - ing in their make-up to offend the sense of fit - ness .

		The work of our best American engrav - ers and scientific artists appears here ; and the work is well done .

		The third volume of the series is fittingly devoted to the unique element in the landscape of
Alaska	LOCATION	, the phenomena of prime interest not only to the visiting scientist but also to the passing traveller , to the principal product of the territory , -- the glaciers .

		This volume is entirely from the pen of Dr.
G. K. Gilbert	PERSON	of the TJ .

		S. Geological Survey , who accompanied the expe - dition .

		It is based on his observations in the
Summer of 1899	DATE	, supplemented by information from various sources , and illustrated by over a hundred text figures and eighteen plates .

		The drawings from which these illustrations are made were the work of Mrs.
Louise M. Keeler	PERSON	and Mr.
W. E. Spader	PERSON	.

		Students and teachers of physical geography desiring illustrations of the phenomena of glaciation will find in this work a list of photographs used in illustration , and information as to where duplicates may be obtained .

		Alaska presents unsurpassed oppor - tunities to the student of glaciers , and its great ice-fields may be easily reached by comfortable steamers .

		Dr.
Gilbert	PERSON	says : ` The glacier-bearing belt includes about three - tenths of the vast territory of
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		Its explora - tion has but just begun , yet enough is known tO ' give it rank as the third great glacier district of the world , only the Antarctic continent and
Greenland	LOCATION	surpass it .

		Its ice may be roughly estimated to occupy a tenth of the surface , or an absolute area of between 15,000 and 20,000 square miles , and its expanse is so divided and scattered as to offer to the student the utmost variety of local conditions and detail .

		Of alpine glaciers , such as would receive individual names if near the homes of men , there are many hundreds , possibly more than a thousand ; of broad composite fields , like the
Muir	PERSON	and
Mala	ORGANIZATION	- spina , there are about half a dozen ; and more than thirty are known to reach the coast and cast bergs into the sea . '

		Naturally , the observations of the Harriman party were limited largely to the tidal glaciers which empty into the sea , and are easily acces - sible by steamer .

		We find , therefore , that most of the report deals with the glaciers about Glacier and
Yakutat Bays	LOCATION	.

		Near the latter , in
College Fiord	ORGANIZATION	, several new glaciers were found , and were named in honor of leading universitiei ?

		and colleges in
New England	LOCATION	.

		The most strik - ing discovery was that of a new fiord of large proportions , in a secluded pocket among the mountains , into which empties a large number of fine glaciers .

		Both the fiord and the mag - nificent terminal glacier were named in honor of the host of the expedition .

		Dr.
Gilbert	PERSON	's treatment of his subject is exhaustive ; and though couched in technical terms , and presented with scientific precision and compactness , it is nevertheless very read - able because of his logical method of presenta - tion and clearness of statement .

		It forms an indispensable guide for every student and trav - eller who visits the shores of
Alaska	LOCATION	and desires an intelligent appreciation of these ma ^ ificent rivers of ice .

		The fourth volume of the series is devoted to Geology and Palaeontology , and is both more varied and more technical than the preceding volume on Glaciers .

		The opportimities for geological work were conditioned by the mode of travel , the route , the location , and the length of stops ; so that this report is largely in the nature of a brief reconnaisance of some of the more accessible features .

		Professor Gilbert writes the introductory chapter ; Professor
Emerson	PERSON	discusses the
General Geology	ORGANIZATION	; Pro- fessor Palache describes the geological features of the famous Treadwell Mine at
Juneau	LOCATION	, the geology about
Chicagof Cove	ORGANIZATION	, and writes the chapter on Minerals ; Dr.
W. H. Dall	PERSON	treats of the Mesozoic Invertebrate Fossils ; Dr.

Yakutat	LOCATION	formation ; and Dr.
Knowlton	PERSON	furnishes an abundantly illustrated chapter on
Fossil Plants	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fragmentary as the data obtained by this expedition were , they nevertheless suf - fice to indicate the geological age of some points on the coast of
Alaska	LOCATION	, and afEord some impor - tant evidence bearing on the correlation of th-e age of different localities .

		Palaeontological col - lections included thirty-eight new species and seven new genera belonging to the
Jurassic	LOCATION	and
Eocene	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fifth volume of the series is devoted to the Cryptogamic Botany of the expedition , -- to the fungi , lichens , algas , mosses , hepatics , and ferns of
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		The volume has had the immediate editorial supervision of Professor
William Trelease	PERSON	, Director of the
Shaw Botan	PERSON	- ical Gardens of
St. Louis	LOCATION	; and his hand has prepared the very readable Introduction , as well as the chapter on the ferns .

		The cosmo - politan character of modem science is well illus - trated by the fact that Italian , French , and German , as well as American , specialists have contributed signed articles to this volume , in some instances in joint authorship .

		The nar - row lines within which the specialist of to-day must work is further suggested by the fact that about forty botanists contribute to this volume , either directly as authors , or indirectly as con - sulted experts .

		The net result of these botan - ical explorations is a compact and succinct sur - vey of the cryptogamic flora of
Alaska	LOCATION	, showing a total of
1616	DATE	species , of which a number are new to science .

		The high standard of excellence maintained throughout the volumes of this series , -- the thick linen paper of the best grade , the lavish illustrations in line , half-tone , and color , the triple covers to the simple and elegant bind - ing , -- all suggest that no expense has been spared to make this publication noteworthy among the reports of scientific expeditions here or elsewhere .

		The question might be , and indeed has been raised , as to whether the money thus spent might not have been better used .

		To be sure , it might have published many more scientific papers than will appear in these four - teen volumes !

		But after all is said , there remains this superb ensample of what can be done ; and though all subsequent scientific pub - lications may not attain to a like sumptuous apparel , there are few which will not be stimu - lated by this model to strive for the best in form , materials , and illustration .

		Many , though not all , of our American scientific publications have been in the past , and some are even yet , distinctly cheap and shabby in comparison with most continental publications of equal rank .

		May the
Harriman Alaska Expedition	ORGANIZATION	be an omen of better days !

		It is perhaps typical of the spirit of our time that what was originally planned as a family pleasure-trip , with generous hospitality , should turn out to be a scientific expedition of unex - pected proportions .

		It was inevitable that such a group of men of thought and action as com - posed the
Harriman Alaska Expedition	ORGANIZATION	should have produced this permanent contribution to the sum of the world 's knowledge .


Charles Atwood Kofoid	PERSON	.

		The Hero of a Lost Cause .

		* It is unlikely that history affords another instance where the leader of a losing cause suc - ceeded in retaining the love , admiration , and respect of his followers , and even of his enemies , to the extent noted in the case of General Kob - ert
E. Lee	ORGANIZATION	.

		Friends and foes alike pay tribute to his worth as a man , his ability as a soldier , and his heroism under crushing defeat .

		Now that the acerbities growing out of civil strife have been softened by time , it is safe to say that there is no American , North or South , who does not gladly enroll him among the most eminent of his fellow-countrymen .

		And the book of ' Recollections and Letters ' prepared by his son and namesake will deepen this impression , at the same time that it proves the son to have no small share of the candor , vera - city , and magnanimity of his highly distin - guished father .

		The common experience of mankind attests that ' blood will tell ' ; and certainly there is no family boasting prouder achievements among the various branches of its stock than the Lees of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		This book notes that at the con - clusion of the Civil War , Englishmen of means offered General
Lee	PERSON	an estate and income in their own country commensurate with ' the dig - nity of an historic family . '

		It was declined , needless to say ; for if the traditions of the Lees were aristocratic in the finest sense of a much abused word , they were none the less democratic in the good American sense , -- constituting what
Jefferson	PERSON	calls those of the ' aristoi , ' the class to which he looked for government of this great land of ours .

		And since the peculiar civiliza - tion of the South served to develop this class to an extent probably seen nowhere else in the world , it is small wonder that the South domi - nated the country until the very verge of the war between the States , and came perilously near winning in that unequal contest .

		It is generally known that General
Lee	PERSON	was the son of ` Light-Horse
Harry ' Lee	PERSON	, one of the Txiost daring and most lovable of the heroes of • Recollections and Letters of General
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	.

Oct. 16	DATE	, the Revolution .

		It is not so generally known that
General Henry	ORGANIZATION	liee was buried at
Dun	ORGANIZATION	- geness , en
Cumberland Island	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, where he died at the house of General
Nathanael Greene	PERSON	on his return from the
West Indies	LOCATION	in
1818	DATE	.

		His more distinguished son first visited the spot , as his letter records , in
January , 1862	DATE	, when the war was at its height .

		Nor is it gen - erally known that General Lee married , in
Mary Custis	PERSON	, the great-granddaughter of the widow
Custis	PERSON	who is endeared to Americans as
Martha Washington	LOCATION	.

		General L `` e 's letters to his dearly beloved wife form the foundation of this pleas - ant volume , appropriately bound in Confeder - ate grey and illustrated with four photogravure portraits of the great leader .

		These letters to the wife are supplemented chiefly by the remin - iscences of the son who , being of the same name , is distinguished as
Captain Lee	LOCATION	.

		Numerous other authentic sources are drawn upon , but it is from these two that the most distinct impres - sions are received .

		They disclose at once that fineness of nature which ensures respect and that profound sympathy with humankind which begets affection .

		No figure could be more manly than that presented by General
Lee	PERSON	to his imme - diate family .

		Captain
Lee	PERSON	's reminiscences begin with the return of his father from the war with
Mexico	LOCATION	, in which no small share of military glory came to him .

		His residence at
West Point	LOCATION	, while Superintendent of the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	there , is quite clear in his mind .

		The breaking out of the war between the States is even more clearly recalled , and some vivid impressions thereof are here set down .

		Concerning General
Lee	PERSON	's attitude at the time , a letter from him to Rev - erdy
Johnson	PERSON	establishes beyond question the fact that
Lee	PERSON	was unofficially tendered the com - mand of the armies of the
United States	LOCATION	before his resignation as Colonel of the
First Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	.

		No doubt Captain
Lee	PERSON	reflects his father 's atti - tude in holding to the constitutionality of seces - sion , and the consequent lack of justification in the armed invasion of
Virginia	LOCATION	which induced
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	to take up arms in defense of his
State	ORGANIZATION	, finally succeeding to the chief conmiand of the Confederate forces .

		Possibly no episode in the book seems more characteristic of everyone concerned than Cap - tain
Lee	PERSON	's account of his own enlistment in the Southern army .

		The youth , then a student in the L ^ nirersity of
Virginia	LOCATION	, was fretting because he had not been allowed to don a uniform at the beginning of hostilities ; but his father restrained him until the
Spring of 1863	DATE	, when he gave his consent that he should enter the artillery as a private soldier , sending for him and superintending his equipment himself .

		This interesting episode receives the following com - ment : * It was characteristic of his consideration for others , and the unselfishness of his nature , that at this time , when weighed down , harrassed , and bur - dened by the cares incident to bringing the untrained forces of the Confederacy into the field , and preparing them for a struggle the seriousness of which he knew better than anyone , he should give his time and attention to the minute details of fitting out his youngest son as a private soldier .

		I think it worthy of note that the son of the com - manding general enlisting as a private in his army was not thought to be anything remarkable or unusual .

		Neither my mother , my family , my friends , nor myself , expected any other course ; and I do not suppose it ever occurred to my father to think of giving me an office , which he could easily have done .

		I know it never occurred to me , nor did I ever hear , at that time or afterwards , from anyone , that I might have been entitled to better rank than that of a private because of my father 's prominence in
Virginia	LOCATION	and in the
Confederacy	LOCATION	.

		With the good advice to be obedient to all author - ity , to do my duty in everything , great or small , he bade me good-bye , and sent me off to
the Valley of Virginia	LOCATION	, where the command in which I was about to enlist were serving under ''
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	. '' '

		Nor did the young man obtain his commission until after he had repeatedly demonstrated his fitness for it by good conduct under fire .

		Three times he came under his father 's personal atten - tion as a private soldier , and the last of the three is certainly worth setting dovm as illus - trative of several things in the bringing up of the Lee family in the two generations involved .

		Captain Lee recounts the incident as follows : ' On that occasion -LSB- the battle of
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	-RSB- our battery had been severely handled , losing many men and horses .

		Having three guns disabled , we were ordered to withdraw ; and while moving back we passed General
Lee	PERSON	and several of his staff , grouped on a little knoll near the road .

		Having no definite orders where to go , our captain , seeing the com - manding general , halted us and rode over to get some instructions .

		Some others and myself went along to see and hear .

		General
Lee	PERSON	was dismounted , with some of his staff around him , a courier hold - ing his horse .

		Captain Poague , commanding our battery , the
Eockbridge Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, saluted , reported our condition , and asked for instructions .

		The General , listening patiently , looked at us , -- his eyes passing over me without any sign of recognition , -- and then ordered Captain Poague to take the most serviceable horses and men , man the uninjured gun , send the disabled part of his command back to refit , and report to the front for duty .

		As Poague turned to go , I went up to speak to my father .

		When he found out who I was , he congratulated me on being well and unhurt .

		I then said : ' '' General , are you going to send us in again ? ''

		* '' Yes , my son , '' he replied , with a smile ; '' you all must do what you can to help drive these people back . '' '

		This incident , which certainly borders on the heroic , is noted in a letter from
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	to Mrs.
Lee	PERSON	soon after , in which he says , ' I have not laid eyes on Eob since I saw him in the battle of
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	, -- going in with a single gun of his for the second time , after his com - pany had been withdrawn in consequence of three of its guns having been disabled . '

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		235 By one of the familiar paradoxes of history , • General
Lee	PERSON	's very prominence kept him from a free expression of opinion , certainly from 3 -RRB- ublic expressions of opinion on important • questions .

		It is the great value of this book that it contains many of his private opinions on such topics , and many interesting estimates of men and events .

		Expressions by him regard - ing three of the men with whom he was most intimately connected are reproduced as fol - lows : * The joy of our victory at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	was • saddened by the death of '' Stonewall ''
Jackson	PERSON	.

		His loss was the heaviest blow the
Army of North	ORGANIZATION	- ern
Virginia	LOCATION	ever sustained .

		To
Jackson	PERSON	's note tell - ing hira that he was wounded , my father replied : '' I ■ can not express my regret at the occurrence .

		Could I have directed events , I should have chosen for the good of the country to have been disabled in your stead .

		I congratulate you on the victory , which is due to your skill and energy . ''


Jackson	PERSON	said , when this was read to him , `` Better that ten Jacksons should fall than one Lee . ''

		Afterward , when it was reported that
Jackson	PERSON	was doing well ,
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	playfully sent him word , `` You are better off than I am , for while you have only lost your left , I have lost my right arm . ''

		Then , hearing he was worse , he said , '' Tell him that I am praying for liim as I believe I have never prayed for myself . ' ' '

		* `` I was sitting on my horse very near to Gen - • eral Lee , '' writes Captain
W. Gordon McCabe	PERSON	to
Oaptain Lee	PERSON	, `` when a courier galloped up with the despatch announcing that General
J. E. B. Stuart	PERSON	had been mortally wounded and was dying .

		General
Lee	PERSON	was evidently greatly affected , and `` aid slowly , as he folded up the despatch , ' ' General ■
Stuart	PERSON	has been mortally wounded : a most valuable and able officer . ''

		Then , after a moment , he added in a voice of deep feeling , `` He never brought me a piece of false iuf ormation , '' -- turned and looked away .

		What praise dearer to a soldier 's heart ■ could fall from the lips of the commanding general `` touching his Chief of Cavalry ! ' '

		General
Lee	PERSON	was asked after the war , by a lady , `` his opinion of the position and part Mr.
-LSB- JeffersonJ Davis	PERSON	had taken and acted during the war .

		He replied : `` If my opinion is worth anything , you `` an always say that few people could have done better than Mr.
Davis	PERSON	.

		I knew of none that could liave done as well . '' '

		Regarding the most momentous of all Gen - • eral Lee 's combats , he himself wrote to an inquiring historian as follows : * As to the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, I must again refer you to the official accounts .

		Its loss was occa - sioned by a combination of circumstances .

		It was commenced in the absence of correct intelligence .

		It was continued in the effort to overcome the diffi - • culties by which we were surrounded , and it would Tiave been gained could one determined and united T -RRB- low have been delivered by our whole line .

		As it was , victory trembled in the balance for three days , and the battle resulted in the infliction of as • great an amount of injury as was received , and in frustrating the Federal campaign for the season . '

		A pleasant anecdote relating to the meeting of the two
Gettysburg	LOCATION	commanders is recorded ,
Lee	PERSON	and
Meade	PERSON	having been friends and com - rades in the ' old ' army , before the war .

		The
Confederate	ORGANIZATION	said , `
Meade	ORGANIZATION	, years are telling on you ; your hair is getting quite grey . ' '

		Ah ,
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	, ' replied
Meade	PERSON	promptly , ' it is not the work of years ; you are responsible for my grey hairs . '

		Through Mr.
Cazenove Lee	PERSON	,
Captain Lee	ORGANIZATION	is able to record a conversation between
Cassius Lee	ORGANIZATION	and his cousin-german .

		General
Lee	PERSON	, in
July , 1870	DATE	.

		A portion , at least , of this weighty exchange of opinion must be set down , for all of it has historic value .

		In the words of Mr.
Cazenove Lee	PERSON	,
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	thought that ` If
Jackson	PERSON	had been at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	they would have gained a victory ; '' for , '' said he , ''
Jackson	PERSON	would have held the heights which
Ewell	PERSON	took the first day . ''

		He said that
Ewell	PERSON	was a fine officer , but would never take the responsibility of exceed - ing his orders , and having been ordered to
Gettys	PERSON	- burg , he would not go farther and hold the heights beyond the town .

		I asked him which of the Federal generals he considered the greatest , and he an - swered , most emphatically , `` McClellan by all odds . ''

		He was asked why he did not come to
Washington	LOCATION	after the second
Manassas	LOCATION	.

		`` Because , '' he replied , `` my men had nothing to eat . '' '

		It is worthy of note that less than half the volume is devoted to General
Lee	PERSON	in war-time , the greater part of it describing his conduct after
Appomattox	LOCATION	, especially in relation to his position as President of
Washington	LOCATION	College .

		Whether in peace or war , defeat or victory , the well-drawn portrait in this book shows a man truly great , one of the first of all Americans .

		PARTISAN History .

		* The history of a party , if it is to be of any permanent value , should be written by one who has the clear vision of a historian and the calm judgment of a philosopher , rather than the enthusiasm of an advocate .

		While he who writes it should set down naught in malice , he should likewise naught extenuate .

		He should , above all things , grasp the principle or prin - ciples differentiating the subject of his study from all opposing parties .

		Back of this , he should understand in its fulness the fact that the party , like the Sabbath , was made for man , and not man for the party .

		The origin of the party should be carefully sought in the ante - cedent history of the earlier parties which it displaced or absorbed .

		Its career should be traced with some recognition of the truth that the opinions and principles of a party are by no means the same when in power as when in oppo - sition ; that success inevitably breeds insolence , and that affliction is good for the soul of parties * The Republican Party .

Oct. 16	DATE	^ as well as of individuals .

		The fact that , in the main , half the nation supports some other party than the one in power should bring to mind the sanity of the people , which the greatest of Republicans so thoroughly respected , and should suggest the thought that where there are two great parties both may stand for some great principle , and that in the balance aiud poise of continuous readjustment the promise of safety lies .

		The writer of the book now under considera - tion does not meet these conditions ; indeed , this is perhaps not to be expected in a work introduced by the three highest in rank and influence of the exponents of Republican policy .

		The work might better have been entitled , ' His - tory of the
United States	LOCATION	during the
Suprem	PERSON	- acy of the Republican Party . '

		It is an interest - ing narration of superficial events : connection is rarely suggested .

		One looks in vain for an explanation of the genetic connection of the Republican party with the older Whigs or
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralists .

		He would however hardly expect to be correctly informed by one who writes : * The name National Republican was retained until the campaign of
1832	DATE	, when the party became known as the Anti-Mason party , afterwards the Whigs , ' or who makes of the ' personal rule ' of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	a secession from the Repub - lican party of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, giving rise to the Democratic party .

		The fundamental distinc - tion between the two great parties of our national history does not appear in the present narrative .

		Our attention is so restricted to the heralding of nominating conventions and plat - forms , that we learn nothing of the growth and change of public opinion .

		We are so occupied with the machinery of party that we almost for - get to ask for the motive-power back of the machinery .

		The critical spirit of the author i-i indicated by one of the sub - titles to the conclud - ing chapter , ' The Same Grand Old Party , ' and by the following sentence from that chapter : * The Republican party , in its policies , its legis - lation , and its administration of the laws made by its chosen legislators , has from the beginning never faltered , never thought of retreat , and has never left a work till it was finished prop - erly . '

		After reading this , one is prepared for a complete justification of the deeds of Repub - lican administrations and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from
1861	DATE	to the present day ; and the only partial excep - tion to such a justification is found when the tariff of
1883	DATE	is reached .

		The author then says : ' There is no criticism to be made upon the attempt of the Republican party to revise the Tariff laws in
1882	DATE	and
1883	DATE	.

		It is only chari - table to say that they were not equal to the occa - sion . '

		The prosperity which has come to the country since the passage of the
Dingley	PERSON	tariff act is most naively accredited to that legisla - tion as a sufficient and adequate cause , with never a suspicion that the question of a stable - standard was what the country went to the polls - for with a unanimity that almost submerged the Republican party under a rush of independ - ent voters .

		One would look to see some adequate discus - sion of the principlesi involved in the Recon - struction of the South after the war , -- such a discussion as Mr.
McCall	PERSON	gives in his admirable - biography of
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, -- in a two - volume history of the party of Reconstruction .

		Instead , we find the subject dismissed in a few pages , with the final word , ' It is the generally accepted opinion ,
thirty years later	DATE	, that they not only did the best they could , but did their - work well and with the purest of motives . '

		In spite of this ipse dixit , many are still claiming that not only purity of motive , but practical wisdom is necessary to statesmanship , and are ready to argue with that expert authority on this subject ,
Ex-Governor Chamberlain	PERSON	, that Reconstruction was a dismal failure .

		That interesting chapter in Reconstruction history -- the conflicting views of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	and Con - gress -- is barely indicated .

		The financing of the war period , with its heritage of woe to the next generation in fiat money , is covered by the statement , ' It is enough to say that in the very darkest hour the finances of the country , its methods of taxation , the coins and credits and ^ payments , were as near perfect as human wis - dom could devise . '

		Curiously enough ,
Secre	PERSON	- tary Chase did not think so !

		The evil condi - tions that confronted Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	in
1893	DATE	, and led to the disastrous industrial period that followed , conditions largely due to the silver legislation of a Republican
Congress	ORGANIZATION	summed ' up in the Sherman Act , to the extravagance of a Republican administration , and to the incom - petency of a Republican Secretary of the Treas - ury , are all laid to the charge of the administra - tion that inherited them .

		When a reluctant
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, impelled at length by public distress and Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's importunity , passed the repeal act of
1893	DATE	, which paved the way for the - good times that came in with Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	, .

		the candid chronicler can only concede : * Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	and his advisers were astute enough to see that some attempt must be made to allay the apprehension of the business community ; consequently an extra session was called , result - ing in the repeal . '

		It is ludicrous to find Presi - dent
Cleveland	LOCATION	condemned for one of the best things he consistently and persistently did -- ^ the - vetoing of vicious pension legislation .

		It is amusing also to read the diatribe concerning the ' ^ Mugwump , ' which fills so many pages of the last chapter .

		Not even the discovery that Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	was chosen President in 189 & - by the vote of the independent can abate the

		THE DIAI .

		23T contempt which this dyed-in-the-wool
Eepub	PERSON	- lican visits upon the man who has convictions and dares to give practical expression to them .

		The author states that the last Whig conven - tion was held in
1852	DATE	, although he records the proceedings of a later one .

		He does not know why President
Jackson	PERSON	allowed
Troup	ORGANIZATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	nullifiers to defy the decree of his special enemy
John Marshall	PERSON	, while enforcing the law against
Calhoun	PERSON	and
South Carolina	LOCATION	, in which case
Jackson	PERSON	was defied .

		He dis - parages Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's ' hig ` her law ' statement , in which every true Republican should glory , by finding a precedent for it in
Amos Kendall	PERSON	's setting the local community above the higher law , and so finding a sanction for his violation of the mails ; citing also a still earlier prece - dent in the utterance of a
Missouri	LOCATION	judge , plac - ing mob action above the law of the land .

		In closing this well-written and .

		plausible campaign document , the historian recurs to the words of the great classical writer
Bentley	PERSON	on perusing a copy of Pope 's Iliad : ' A very pretty poem , Mr , Pope , but not Homer . '

		Those who love the Republican party for what it has done of righteousness , despite its sins and its sinners , will look still to see its history portrayed in true colors .

		* Since Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's delightful idyll of boy - hood , * A Boy 's Town , ' there has perhaps been no worthier companion volume than Mr.
Bar	PERSON	- row 's ' Farmington . '

		If one were born a boy , and has lived long enough to be able to look back and understand what it was to be young , and what his youth has meant to him ever since , he will find his real self again in these limpid pages .

		And if he be lucky enough to have begun life in the country , or in a village which was so small as to be almost the same thing , tucked in beside a millstream that divided two high hills , he will see with his waking eyes the places and the people that come to him in dreams , -- dreams that are perhaps the best part of his life .

		In
Farmington	LOCATION	there was a church , a district school , a square , a burying-ground , and a mill .

		In the church , long hours of torture were spent by restless urchins , who were in great awe of the minister , and were surprised when they dis - covered later that he was a real man like others whom they knew .

		In the school-house , the little ruffians made life wretched for the teacher , and had as much fun and wasted as little time over their studies as was possible for them to do .

		Memories of a Boyhood In a
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania Village .

		By
Clarence S. Darrow	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They read the highly moral tales of the old readers , they declaimed the threadbare old ora - tions , and they governed themselves and each other according to the primal code of morals known to boys for many generations .

		In the village square they played the games suggested by the changing year ; and along the stream , in the woods , fields , and over the hills , they had the endless varieties of fun and learned the thousand things which go to form the mind and character of country-bred children .

		Through the burying-ground they went only when they could prove the safety that lies in numbers , and when the sun shone on the tomb - stones which figured in their plan of life like sentient things .

		It is , however , when speaking of the village mill , which was the boy 's homei as well , that Mr ,
Darrow	PERSON	is at his best .

		He has touched the simple life that flowed through and around it with a touch so wistful and so tender that the reader can only guess if there was a smile on his lips as he wrote , or if they were pressed together to keep back the tears .

		Not much character-drawing is attempted in this little book ; and in this reserve Mr.
Darrow	PERSON	shows much wisdom .

		People are not often clearly diiferentiated by the minds of children , who accept their social surroundings with as little question as they do their physical environ - ment .

		A few figures stand out with boldness , however , and if they are drawn with simple lines , the lines have a vigor and directness that give them quite enough of both light and shade .

		The well-known ne'er - do-weel who lives in every village in every land has rarely been better drawn than in the light sketch of '
Ferman Henry	PERSON	, ' whose counterpart may be found in *
Sam Lawson	PERSON	' in Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's memorable ' Old Town Folks . ' '

		Aunt
Mary	PERSON	' is another auld acquaintance whom one is not likely to for - get , -- the woman who lived in bondage to a heartless idol called Neatness , whose cult she ever preached to an unheeding generation . '


Squire Allen	PERSON	, ' the ' great man of the village , ' was so very great that it was quite inconceivable how so small a place could hold him ; and the loungers and scandal-mongers of the black - smith 's and shoemaker 's shops , -- we have seen them all before .

		The crowning glory of the book is the portrait of the boy 's father , -- the gentle , honest , un - worldly old miller , who put aside the fervid longings of his own spirit in order that he might feed and clothe the children who thronged about his hearth ; who , loving honor , loving integrity , loving justice , above all else loved learning , in the beautiful old sense of the word .

		One rarely hears it so used in these hurried times , and perhaps it is the mission of the little book to open the eyes of a restless later day to the old and deep well-spring of contentment 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, that lies behind it .

		Here is a bit of this filial and tender portrait : ` Above the little porch that shelters the front door is my father 's study window .

		I look in and see him sitting at his desk with his shaded lamp ; before him is his everlasting book , and his pale face and long white hair bend over the infatuating pages with all the confidence and trust of a little child .

		For a simple child he always was , from the time when he first saw the light until his friends and comrades lowered him into the sandy loam of the old churchyard .

		I see him through the little panes of glass , as he bends above the book .

		The chapter is finished and he wakens from his reverie into the world in which he lives and works ; he takes off his iron-framed spectacles , lays down his book , comes downstairs and calls me away from my com - panions with the old story that it is time to come into the house and get my lessons .

		For the hun - dredth time I protest that I want to play , -- to finish my unending game ; and again he tells me no , that
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	began studying Greek when he was only three years old .

		And with heavy heart and muttered imprecations on
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, I am taken away from my companions and my play , and set down beside my father with my book .

		I can feel even now my sorrow and despair , as 1 leave my playmates and turn the stupid leaves .

		But I would give all that I possess to-day to hear my father say again , as in that far-off time , ``
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	began studying Greek when he was only three years old . '' ' '

		Farmington ' is not a book to be taken from the public library , or even to be borrowed from an obliging friend .

		It is not a book for the limited express , or the smoking-room of an inn .

		It is a book to own , -- to read by the win - ter 's fire , and re-read under a
summer	DATE	tree ; a book to be kept on the shelf where the oldest favorites live .

		It is a book for boys , for women , -- ' but above all , it is a book for men who have once been boys .

		unexplained the real contents of belief and desires , and it places no valuation upon them , lends no standards to test them .

		Imitation is even made the source of invention .

		Is this final and adequate ?

		Strictly speaking , imitation is likeness , repetition ; while invention signifies a novelty .

		Imitation is a fact which explains many facts , but it is itself a phenomenon to be explained .

		Professors
Baldwin	PERSON	,
Cooley	PERSON	, and other psychologists , have seen the defect and contributed further considerations ; but the problem is not yet solved .

		Simply to give abun - dant illustrations of the copying process does not diminish our need of further insight into the exact reasons why the child frowns when its mother frowns , or why a savage prince struts in the silk hat of a European , with little else in the way of clothing .

		In reading Tarde 's argument , one may be persuaded to think imitation will explain every - thing ; but the author himself is not under this illusion , and gives abundant facts to correct it Imitation implies a common psychical nature , and must not be pressed too far .

		* Every new fashion endeavors to become rooted in custom ; but only a few are successful for the same rea - son that many germs are abortive ... The rule of fashion is tied to that of reason . '

		For exam - ple , the Esquimaux may wonder at and admire the dress of men and women from
Italy	LOCATION	, but they will not copy them .

		Imitation is influen - tial , but it must not require the Arctic nations to give up blubber and live on rice .

		French wine was added to beer in
England	LOCATION	, but most Englishmen prefer beer .

		Glimpses of
H. de Vries	ORGANIZATION	' mutation theory may be seen in this work , especially in connec - tion with the rise of invention .

		Novelties do not arise by slow gradations alone , but last - ing institutions
spring	DATE	up suddenly .

		Thus -LRB- p. 267 -RRB- : ` In
India	LOCATION	, where in the depths of Hindooism the birth of some very low form of religion is actually an everyday occurrence ,
Lyell	ORGANIZATION	informs us that their starting-point lies in the preaching of some exalted reformer , of some ascetic or celibate . '

		Tarde evidently wrote about
America	LOCATION	in ^ a friendly spirit , so that the following bit of mis - information must illustrate the danger of sec - ond-hand reports of travellers : ` From one end to the other of the
United States	LOCATION	, from top to bottom , throughout all classes , even among good-looking women -LRB- and there is certainly no more striking example of the power of imitation than this -RRB- , we find the repugnant habit of tobacco - chewing , -- a fact that explains the universal pres - ence of the spittoon , the most indispensable piece of furniture in
America	LOCATION	.

		Is this a habit that is made necessary by the exigencies of race and climate ?

		Not at all ; it is another case of fashion and custom . '

		If all
M. Tarde	PERSON	's illustrations were of this kind his book would not carry conviction very far .

		THE DIAL .

		239 - The translation here noticed is quite well done , from the second edition -LRB-
1895	DATE	-RRB- , the first French edition having appeared in
1890	DATE	.

		The biographical introduction by
Professor Giddings	ORGANIZATION	gives a brief and clear survey of the literary career of the author , who has died since this translation appeared .

		One must be a bold spirit to venture with Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	on the vast scheme of ` An Exam - ination of Society . '

		If we follow the author , we shall traverse the entire course of human history from primitive savagery to the most recent and highest achievements of science anid art .

		The range of topics and the list of authorities cited are enough to awe the most universal and ver - satile of scholars .

		Hebrew , Greek , Roman , medigeval and modern civilizations , are passed under review to illustrate a theory of ' social cleavage . '

		Where the whole argument comes to the practical i & sue , in the last chapter , we find that we have left in our critical crucible the author 's own panacea of heavy taxation -- some would say confiscation -- of land values ; and there is an ingenious line of evidence to prove that the inventor of this theory has not plagiarized from
Henry George	ORGANIZATION	or the social - ists .

		The author of ' The Socialization of Human - ity ' is serious , if we can judge by style and con - tent of the book .

		He is possessed by the philo - sophical craving for unification of experience .

		He hopes to reach a ' complete orientation of the race and the establishment of the principles which will lead to the democratization and socialization of humanity . '

		Religion is the supreme interest of humanity , and that because the object of religion is humanity itself .

		Sin is ignorance .

		The salvation of the race is science , -- organized and diffused knowledge of the conditions of universal well-being .

		There are many quotations from Comte , and even the allusions to Spencer do not show that his pro- test against the Positivist deposition of religion has been heeded . '

		Instead of God read human - ity .

		The all-seeing eye is conscience ; the all - feeling heart is sympathy , duty . '

		We have a misleading reference to Kant -LRB- p. 90 -RRB- ; his destructive criticism of theology is mentioned , but nothing is said of his constructive argu - ment .

		This is the author 's idea of a university : ' Every teacher in a university struggles with every other teacher to see which one can worry the student most with dry , hard tasks , exasper - ating examinations , brain-racking quizzes ; that teacher being deemed the best who can produce the most dismay , despair , and disaster ' -LRB- p. 183 -RRB- .

		One must feel relieved after expelling that kind of matter from his consciousness !

		There is much that is true and nobly said , albeit with wearisome repetition , in this volume .

		Those who have not felt the rational difficulties of this form of crude monism may regard it as final .

		But those who have studied
Kant	PERSON	,
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	,
Green	ORGANIZATION	,
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	, and
Tiel	ORGANIZATION	, as well as Comte and
Spencer	PERSON	, M'ill be likely to conclude that there are some problems still left in philosophy of which this writer has not even had a glimpse .

		But this brief paragraph is not the place for a counter-argument or for a plea for the detested idealism .

		Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	's book on ' Social Ethics ' has for its sub-title ' An Introduction to the
Nature and Ethics of the State	ORGANIZATION	. '

		It is , in fact , a plea for some sort of a theocracy .

		The book is writ - ten to prove that our government ought to con - fess the creed of Christianity .

		The author evi - dently does not recall the
New England	LOCATION	trial of his method , and the resulting hypocrisy , per - secution , and oppression of dissenters .

		He seems never to have read or duly considered the analysis of
Roger Williams	PERSON	, or the reasons which led the religious founders of our republic and authors of our Constitution to avoid pre - cisely the mischief which this writer 's scheme would bring upon us .

		Socialism has many shrewd methods of secur - ing a hearing , and one of these is omitting the label and signature .

		In Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Oilman	ORGANIZATION	's ' Human Work , ' as in Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's keen and caustic * Theory of the Leisure Classes , ' we have a recommendation of the med - icine in the guise of a story ; only here we have a highly passionate and at times dramatic plea , whereas in
Veblen	PERSON	we have only the frosty star - light of pure science .

		The feminine advocate has a theory of work which urges that if society wants production it must first feed its members , provide them all abundantly with comfort and education , and then they will enjoy their tasks and sing even at ditch-digging .

		As for mem - bers of the parasitic group called ' Society , ' our author has little praise .

		` Such women play the game we call `` Society , '' whose trivial performances are celebrated so respectfully in our newspapers in their record of dinners and dresses and dances , as if what these people ate , or what they wore , or how they hopped about , was of any earthly importance ... They even designate their pitiful amusements as `` social functions , '' a misnomer as consummately absurd as `` Christian Science . ''

		... For a lot of richly caparisoned human animals to get together and eat , or embrace one another and caper about to the sound of music , has no more relation to a social function than
St. Vitus	ORGANIZATION	' dance has to chopping wood .

		A disease is not a function . '

		Yet Mrs. Oilman 's book is a serious one , and contains , along with much crude expression of raw materials of systematic thinking , many powerful and valid arguments for the socializa - tion of production .

		The modem world is going that way much more rapidly than some people like to believe ; and those who detest the visions of Socialism most of all , the ' captains of indus - ^ 40 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, try / are those who seem to do more to push and pull society in the direction of unified pro- duction and social control than all the inspired prophets of the ' proletariate . '

		Mr.
C. S. Loch	PERSON	has brought together a num - ber of valuable papers relating to charity work • of the modern type , which represent the more recent tendencies in this sphere .

		The motto on the title-page is significant : ' If citizens be friends , they have no need of justice ; but , though they be just , they need friendship or love also ; indeed , the completest realization of justice seems to be the realization of friendship or love also . '

		Social science may be compared to the work of the ' assembler ' in a watch fac - tory .

		His function is to arrange the various parts so that they will finally mark the time , -- the duty of a watch .

		All kinds of data , while isolated , minister little if at all to human wel - fare ; but marshalled in subordination to supreme social ends , they ameliorate man 's estate .

		Thus , in this book the physicians advise wise action in respect to dispensaries and the rearing of children , the work of a hospital - almoner , charitable action in phthisical cases ; while other persons , with experience in adminis - tration , give the results of experiments with - agricultural colonies , labor bureaus , industrial partnerships , and poor-laws .

		The essays fur - nish valuable contributions to the science of ■ charity .

		Mr.
Peter Eoberts	PERSON	, the author of ' Anthracite • Coal Communities , ' has already described the more strictly economic aspects of the life of miners in ^ The Anthracite Coal Industry ' -LRB-
1901	DATE	-RRB- ; and in the present volume he sets `` before us the facts relative to the social and moral life of the anthracite mine employers .

		This study of the demography and culture of this interesting people is sane , earnest , idealistic .

		The writer has lived near the people he de - scribes ; and while he lays bare the tragic phe - nomena of their narrow and animalistic exist - ence , he also reveals the promises of a better to-morrow manifested in occasional expressions of aesthetic , ethical , and religious asp ` iration .

		The student of educational method will here confront many neglected factors in the social • conditions of workingmen which demand im - provements in the curriculum of public schools .

		A local study , intensive rather than wide , and ■ dealing with a fairly homogeneous population all dependent on a single industry , has far more value than one which rests on statistics whose averages are meaningless or misleading because they cover too large an area and have too many conflicting facts which cancel each other .

		Yet the universal elements of human nature and need are not obscure , for the writer ' sees all great things in the small . '

		In dealing with .

		.

		this people , we wish to loiow the nature of the territory in which they live , the nationalities represented , the facts about births and deaths , the furniture of the homes , the food and amuse - ments , the treatment of children by parents , the schoolhouses , teachers , and pupils , school attendance , the activity of the churches , the saloon , the savings banks , the criminals , pauper - ism and charity , and politics .

		The author does not rest with description ; he has a remedy for the evils and a working method of ameliora - tion ; and he arranges his argument in a way which should make an impression on all patri - otic citizens who have not lost faith in the regenerating power of justice , reason , and edu - cation .

		Newman as The casual reader of
Newman	PERSON	, writer and whose attention is usually con - ecciesiaatic .

		^ ^ q ^ ^ q the * Apologia ' and the * Idea of a
University	ORGANIZATION	, ' is almost certain to be repelled .

		He made , from the point of view of rational men , ` the great refusal ' ; he said to the tides of intellect , ' No farther . '

		He is a signal example of the mind of the ecclesiastic , that sternly limited , severe , often delicate instrument which deals with idealities as if they were facts , and for that reason , despite its humanitarian ends , frequently seems wanting in genuine human - ity , in a warm-blooded relation to men as they are .

		He was , moreover , with his Hebrew and Huguenot blood , pre-committed to Roman legal - ism and sacramentalism , to an institution rather than to a philosophy , to mechanism rather than to life .

		This , we think , does not overstate the grounds of the casual reader 's repulsion from
Newman	PERSON	.

		Such a repulsion , Dr.
Barry	PERSON	's book on
Newman	PERSON	, published in the * Literary Lives ' series -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , should do somewhat to remove .


Newman	PERSON	was perfectly aware -- no rationalist more so -- that dogma is the merest adumbration of theological truth ; so perfectly aware of this that he has been charged with essential skepti - cism .

		On the other hand , being a practical man and not a metaphysician , he made the funda - mental act of faith in the validity of his own mental processes that we are all obliged to make .

		His ' illative sense ' convinced him of spiritual truth , -- gave him , in other words , * certitude . '

		* Proof ' was not an exclusively logical process , but * the limit of converging probabilities . '

		Could moderation go further ?

		The method was sound ; that it should have led him to
Rome	LOCATION	is no miracle .

		Even Huxley thought it led either to
Rome	LOCATION	or to Agnosticism .

		There is no more disputing about the judgments of the ' illative sense ' than about those of taste .

		He had exclaimed , in his illness of
1833	DATE	, ' I shall not die , for I have not sinned against light . '

		To the end , this was true .

		New - man 's aloofness from the concerns of ordinary men is harder to defend .

		Fierceness ' he thinks a not undesirable quality of religion as compared with the lukewarmness he deprecated .

		Such a tone is strange and unwelcome in the ears even of good men who know and love their kind .

		It sounds strangely from a son of the Church which , after all , faces the moral facts of human nature as Protestantism has never done .

		* Fierceness , ' it seems to us , is a quality appropriate to no human institution and to no human interpreta - tion of a divine one .

		Dr.
Barry	PERSON	properly lays much stress upon

		That * his conclusions , as a whole , are akin to
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's ' is a statement that will prove illuminating to the casual reader .

		The fact is that while the volume is professedly devoted to
Newman	PERSON	as an English prose classic , the chapters on ' The Logic of Belief ' and * New - man 's Place in History ' are far and away the most interesting .

		So true is it that
Newman	PERSON	, even as the supreme master of English prose , yields in interest to
Newman	PERSON	the man .

		Dr.

		At times it is perhaps a shade fanciful or florid in style , but in tone it is emi - nently moderate and reasonable .

		But why should the author of a ' literary life ' misquote
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- p. 140 -RRB- ?

		The pains and The humor and pathos , the sweet pleasures of gratifications and the bitter disap - offlce-seeking .

		pointments of political life , are agreeably pvortrayed with pen and pencil and camera in Mr.
Joseph Bucklin	PERSON	Bishop 's ' Our Political Drama , ' published by the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three magazine articles on national conventions , presidential inaugurations , and early political caricature in
America	LOCATION	, form the basis of this attractive volume , which , without containing any - thing of great novelty or importance , brings together from such sources as
Greeley	LOCATION	's and Weed 's and Colonel
McClure	PERSON	's political reminis - cences many readable items concerning public men and public events .

		The parallelism in the careei-s of Clay ,
Webster	PERSON	, and
Blaine	PERSON	, each of whom had the presidential bee persistently buzz - ing in his bonnet , is well brought out .

		Clay , whose immortal declaration that he would rather be right than be president is more familiar than its authorship , made at least one other pithy ut - terance , when , disappointed a third time in the hope of his life , he declared his inability to sup - port the successful candidate -LRB-
Taylor	PERSON	-RRB- who had refused him his support four years previously .

		* Magnanimity is a noble virtue , ' said Clay , * and I have always endeavored to practice it ; but it has its limits , and the line of demarcation between it and meanness is not always discernible . '

		The popular myth about
Jefferson	PERSON	's democratic simplicity in riding on horseback and unattended to his inaug - uration , hitching his animal to the palings and Avalking alone into the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	chamber to take the oath of office , is pretty effectually exploded by the author , who has collected a number of interesting incidents relating to that and other presidential inaugurations .

		In dealing with the subject of caricature , he assigns
1832	DATE	as the date when this engine of political warfare was first employed in
America	LOCATION	.

		It seems very unsafe to assert that grotesque or offensive drawings had never before been used in the heat of a pre-elec - tion campaign , even though these interesting objects of art may be no longer extant .

		Lincoln - iana naturally take a prominent place in Mr.
Bish	PERSON	- op 's book ; but it is somewhat surprising that he should choose to relate in full , from
Greeley	LOCATION	's * Recollections , ' the old Fox River anecdote .

		The caricatures of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, reproduced with other similar cartoons , are startling in their hideous coarseness , and make strikingly evident how greatly our cartoonists have improved , both in taste and skill , since the early sixties .

		That the work under review is especially timely at this political season is of course apparent .

		A parson friend like Ms great adversary
Napoleon	PERSON	, of the Duke the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	is being of
Wellington	LOCATION	.

		made the subject of many essays , sketches , and biographies .

		The latest in this kind is a volmne entitled * Reminiscences of the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , written by the late Rev.
G. R. Gleig	PERSON	, and published by his daughter sixteen years after his death .

		Mr.
Gleig	PERSON	's long life of ninety-two years -LRB- 1796-18SS -RRB- was a busy and honorable one .

		As a youth of sixteen he volunteered in a regiment on its way to take part in the
Peninsular	LOCATION	campaign , where he learned to know the Duke -LRB- then
Marquis	PERSON	-RRB- of
Wellington	LOCATION	.

		He had a taste of American service in the war of
1812	DATE	, and wrote an account of the unhappy campaigns at
Washington	LOCATION	and
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		A novel which he published in
1825	DATE	, called ' The Subaltern , ' based on the Peninsular war and dedicated to the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, brought him into favorable notice .

		At this time Mr.
Gleig	PERSON	was rector of
Ash	ORGANIZATION	in Kent , and a near neighbor to
Walmer Castle	ORGANIZATION	, one of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's residences .

		He was on friendly and even intimate terms with the great man , whose confidence he shared , whose views , with some modifications , he followed , and to whose political fortunes he was steadily loyal .

		In
1862	DATE	he published a ' Life of
Wellington	LOCATION	, ' to which the present volume of * Reminiscences ' must be regarded as an appendix .

		Leisurely put together in a serene old age , it is discursive and good-tempered ; and we can smile indulgently at the complacency with which the veteran Tory parson-politician records the good advice which he gave his illustrious patron , and which at times the latter would have done well to follow .

		The
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's three residences ,
Walmer Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Strath	LOCATION	- fieldsaye , and
Apsley House	ORGANIZATION	, are pleasantly described ; and there are sketches of various celeb - rities who at different times were the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's guests , -- among them
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, the
Duke of Cumberland	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	,
Charles Arbuthnot	PERSON	and his charming wife -LRB- who played the role of
Egeria	ORGANIZATION	very successfully -RRB- the second
Marquis	PERSON	of 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	^
Salisbury	PERSON	, and so on , down to such occasional guests as '
Billy ' Holmes	PERSON	and * Chin ' Grant .

		It can not be said that these ' Reminiscences ' add very much to what was previously known of Well - ington , whose singularly simple character , like his ' good gray head , ' was known of all men ; but they form an agreeable addendum to the more formal biographies .

		Recollections A reminiscence of
Rossetti	PERSON	too of
Rossetti	PERSON	, fragmentary to interest many out - by a Friend .

		^ -LSB- ^ q the cult is to be found in * Recollections of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	and his Circle ' by the late
Henry Treffry Dunn	ORGANIZATION	.

		The recollections are edited and annotated -- rather too liberally , we think -- by Mr.
Gale Pedrick	PERSON	.

		Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	furnishes a brief preface sanctioning the book , and the publishers , Messrs.
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have provided several imique illustrations in photogravure .

		Readers of Mr.
William Rossetti	PERSON	's memoir of his brother will re - member that Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	lived with
Rossetti	PERSON	for many years in the capacity of companion , assistant , and disciple ; so this little book represents a genuine and intimate contribu - tion to
Rossetti	PERSON	's biography .

		A large part of it is occupied with an account of Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	's first visit to
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		The painter , who was then a little under forty and at the height of his mental power , received the visitor cordially and showed him over the picturesque old
Cheyne Row	ORGANIZATION	house -- many rooms of which are described in detail in the ' Recollections ' -- and its ample groimds , where
Rossetti	PERSON	kept his queer collection of pets .

		They should hardly be called pets , Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	thinks .


Rossetti	PERSON	was not fond of animals , nor did he know much about them .

		* It was simply a passion he had for collecting , just as he had for books , pictures , and china , which impelled him to convert his house into a sort of miniature
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	and Zoo combined .

		* In his search for old blue Nan - kin ,
Rossetti	PERSON	had friendly rivals in
Howell	PERSON	and *
Jimmy	PERSON	'
Whistler	LOCATION	, who had set the fashion .

		Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	tells an amusing story of a dinner-party that
Howell	PERSON	gave to celebrate a particularly glorious find , and of a return dinner at which
Rossetti	PERSON	expected to be able to celebrate his possession of the same beautiful dish .

		Another interesting chapter deals with the experiments of the
Rossetti	PERSON	circle in table-turning , spirit-rapping , and mesmerism .

		Rossetti 's latest biographer , Mr.
Arthur Benson	PERSON	, has suggested that the poet 's personality !

		has been shown to the world in too detailed a fashion and with too morbid a color - ing ; this little volume , slight yet impressive , and dealing only with the best years of
Rossetti	PERSON	's life , will help to swing the balance toward a saner and more inspiring estimate of his complex char - acter .

		Bits from the Among the recent importations of
Memoirs of Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is a
Marquise	ORGANIZATION	.

		< rphe French Noblesse of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, ' translated by Mrs.
Colqu	PERSON	- houn Grant from the Memoirs of the
Marquise de Crequy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translation is a spirited one , and Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	has shown considerable skill in select - ing , from the seven volumes of the original , pas - sages which have a present interest and at the same time can be fitted one to another so as to - present the aspect of a continuous narrative .

		There is no doubt that the result is good reading .

		The
Marquise	PERSON	-LRB- in the Memoirs at least -RRB- had a ready wit , of tenest barbed , and her reminiscences are full of quaint stories , clever bits of descrip - tion , and graphic accounts of the brilliant court circle in which she moved .

		She was a woman of strong opinions , as witness her intense dislike of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, and the
House of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	, , her serene contempt for the plebeian
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, and her undying devotion to her church and her king .

		Naturally , the Memoirs abound in color and variety .

		For their absolute veracity there is not so much to be said .

		The
Marquise	PERSON	did not write them herself , except possibly a little of the first volume , and since the person who completed the work -- as he alleged , with her cooperation -- was so careless as to mis-state and mis-date events in the life of the supposed author ^ it is not likely that he was over-scrupulous in other matters .

		The Memoirs represent , then , a mass of almost contemporary gossip and tradi - tion , vivified by being put into the mouth of a witty and charming woman , who wishes her grandson to profit by her wide experience of the world .

		The matter of authorship did not trouble the book 's first public , who , when the Memoirs appeared in
1834	DATE	, , seized upon it with avidity , finding verisimilitude if not truth in its contents .

		So , if the author was a fabulist he was a clever one , with an exhaustive knowledge of his sub - ject and an entertaining method , more trust - worthy at least than the historical novelist 's , of impressing upon his readers the atmosphere of pre-revolutionary
France	LOCATION	.

		Personalia and ' Men and Manners of the
Third	ORGANIZATION	politics of the Republic , ' from the pen of Mr.
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	.


Albert D. Vandam	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the last volume we shall have from the popular author of * An Englishman in
Paris	LOCATION	' ; for death overtook him before the book was quite ready for the press , and it was necessary for another hand to put the finishing touches to his manuscript .

		Long resi - dence in
Paris	LOCATION	, with abundant leisure and ample means during at least a part of that period ^ appears to have given the author pre-eminent qualifications for detailing the gossip of the boule - vards ; and those interested in what he has to offer will find his chapters highly entertaining .

		Yet we must not convey a false impression : Mr.
Vandam	PERSON	also conducts us into the labyrinth of French politics with a confidence in his own pow - ers of guidance that is very wonderful .

		We learn some new things which , if true , are noteworthy , -- for example , how very easily the sons of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	could have saved their father 's throne in
1848	DATE	had they cared more for glory and less for money ; and by what a mere accident the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	came into existence in
1870	DATE	, when
Jules Favre	PERSON	, at one o'clock in the morning of the mem - orable fourth of
September	DATE	, was permitted by a compliant chairman to move the deposition of the

Vandam	PERSON	,
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		was * every inch a king , ' and
Thiers	PERSON	,
Gambetta	PERSON	,
Grevy	ORGANIZATION	and company are more or less objects of con - tempt .

		As throwing an occasional side-light on an important epoch in French histoiy , the book has its value ; but one may question whether the revival of memories intimately associated with party quarrels and international hatreds tends to promote the concord of nations , or even , when the memoirs rise at times hardly above the level of gossip , to contribute to the edification of the individual reader .

EU	ORGANIZATION	ROPE AN LIBRARIES .

		In connection with the annual meeting of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	^ held this Fall at
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and given something of an interna - tional character bv the presence of numerous visitors from abroad , the monthly periodical , * Public Libraries , ^ has devoted the greater part of its
October	DATE	issue to a series of special articles upon library conditions in other countries than our own .

		These papers include , besides reports from
England	LOCATION	, the
British Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	, an account , partly historical , partly descriptive , of public library work in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Finland	LOCATION	,
Switzer	PERSON	- land , and
France	LOCATION	.

		The matter provided is extremely interesting , and we have thought it desirable to make a summary of its principal features , accompanied by such comment as they seem to call for .

		The public library idea in
Germany	LOCATION	finds its earliest sponsor in
Martin Luther	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great reformer is quoted as exhorting the aldermen of all German cities to establish Christian schools , and to ' spare neither diligence nor expense to provide good libraries or book houses . '

		He even goes on to specify tlie sort of books that these libraries should contain , making it clear that he has in view the needs of the people at large rather than those of the learned profes - sions .

		The real beginning of popular libraries in the modem sense has , however , a much more recent date than the sixteenth century .

		It is ascribed to the impress made by American example upon the historian
Kaumer	PERSON	, who visited this country in
1841	DATE	, was astonished to find our working-people so well read , and , upon his return home , set about the establishment of the
Volks	ORGANIZATION	- hihUotheken - in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The fact of fundamental importance about German library conditions is that almost everywhere there is a hard and fast distinction between the
Stadthihliotheh	PERSON	and the
Volksbhbliofhek	LOCATION	.

		The former is a vast insti - tution which the general public is not encour - aged to use ; the latter is a meagre collection of such third-rate literature as the masses of the people are supposed to be able to appreciate .

		In many such libraries , we are told , the books of such men as
Heyse	LOCATION	,
Keller	PERSON	, and Storm are not to be found , because they are imagined to be ' over the heads ' of the ' people . '

		Tlie superior - ity of our American idea of a single general col - lection for all classes of readers is very apparent , and it is now being copied in such few of the 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, German nmnicipalities as are not impeded by the _ existence of a StadtbihliotheJc upon an ancient foundation .

		But the prevalent German arrajigement , which provides , as has been neatly said , ' public libraries for the professor and the washerwoman / forces large classes of the most intelligent readers to get their books through private channels .

		In technical and professional matters , American influences are gradually mak - ing themselves felt ; but it will be a long time before the conservative ruling cla ^ sses will come to appreciate the educational mission of the library as we have now come to realize it in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A condition of affairs closely resembling that existing in
Germany	LOCATION	is found in
Denmark	LOCATION	, which also presents the two types of library -- the large central -LRB- city or university -RRB- collection , and the inadequate people 's library , which we are told is ' mainly of importance in giving access to good fiction . '

		Even in the capital , the papular libraries contain only a few thou - sand volumes each , and are open for only two or three hours in the
evening	TIME	.

		The village and parish libraries are upon an even more modest scale than this , having in some cases not more than a few hundred volumes , and being grateful for a state subsidy of two or
three dollars	MONEY	a year .

		Yet the
Danes	PERSON	are great readers , and are so thoroughly appreciative of what opportunities they have that the librarian may regard the country as offering particularly fruitful soil for his missionar -RCB- ^ labors .

		Swedish conditions are naturally a good deal like Danish conditions .

		In the country , the parish libraries seldom contain above five hun - dred volumes .

		The people 's library of
Gothen	PERSON	- burg , the outcome of private philanthropy , with a fine building and nine thousand books , comes nearer than any other institution in
Sweden	LOCATION	to resemblinp '' an American public library .

		In
Stockholm	LOCATION	also , private philanthropy and coop - erative enterprise have provided several collec - tions that are largely used by the working - classes .

		The story of
Finland	LOCATION	's libraries is the record of a paithetic struggle for culture against poverty and adverse conditions generally .

		There are now in the countr -RCB- ^ besides the subsidized or endowed libraries of the towns , about eighteen hundred parish libraries .

		In fact , nearly every Tinnish parish has one or more libraries , a state of things which can not help reminding us of the
New England	LOCATION	towns .

		These libraries a , re Tery small affairs naturally , averaging two or three hundred volumes each , and the ' bibliothe - cary ' is rewarded by the munificent salary of five or
ten dollars	MONEY	annually .

		But the Finns are zealous in the pursuit of popular education , and are entitled to the warmest sympathies of all mankind in their present desperate effort to preserve their racial ideals from absorption bv the mighty empire which controls their political destinies .

		We are again reminded of
New England	LOCATION	-LRB- this time by contrast -RRB- , when we read the open - ing paragraph of the account of Dutch public libraries .

		The writer says : ' While the state of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	has 351 towns with free libraries and two towns without them , there are in the whole
Kingdom of the Netherlands	LOCATION	only two towns with such an institution . '

		This does not mean , however , that there are no popu - lar libraries of other kinds .

		On the contrary , there are many such , established by societies and subscription .

		But Dordrecht and
Groningen	PERSON	are the only tovras that have free public libraries in our understanding of the term .


Austria	LOCATION	, with its mixed population , makes a fair account of itself , although the popular libraries are almost without exception the result of private or social enterprise , and may be used only upon the payment of a small fee .


Vienna	LOCATION	provides public support for its public libraries to the amount of about
ten thousand dollars	MONEY	a year , and this subsidy , in addition to the fees , results in a circulation of over three millions .

		Little
Switzerland	LOCATION	, also a country of mixed population , does much better than the great Empire .

		A library census taken nearly forty years ago showed more than two thousand libraries whose ' express purpose was the satisfy - ing of the demand for reading , of whatever character , of any considerable and varying num - ber of people . '

		Conditions have improved greatly since that reckoning , but it is interest - ing to know that , even then , few places were so small or so remote as to be entirely without the civilizing agency of a collection of books for public use .

		The national libraxy at
Bern	LOCATION	now comes near to the American ideal of a great pub - lic library .

		Its use is absolutely free , and , upon payment of postage , residents of any part of
Switzerland	LOCATION	can have books sent to them , up to six volumes at a time .

		State and municipal library appropriations have largely increased of late years , and professional ideas of manage - ment are rapidly gaining ground .

		The last of our notes has
France	LOCATION	for its sub - ject , this being the only Latin country repre - sented in the series of articles which has served us for material .

		We are told at the start that ' ^ the public library system of
France	LOCATION	has been developed largely through the inspiration re - ceived originally from an American , and that our own
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	. '

		It was a Frank - lin Society , founded by one
M. Giraxd	PERSON	about half a century ago , that inaugurated the move - ment for popular libraries in
France	LOCATION	, and has supported that movement ever since .

		These

		The collections are of a prac - tical character , and are used mainly by working - people .

		A CRITIC ON C RITICISM .

		Professor
George Saintsbury	PERSON	's History of Criticism is more than a book -- it is an explor - ation , almost a conquest .

		One might picture Professor
Saintsbur	PERSON	-RCB- - as Herakles -- or was it Dionysius -- returning in triumph from
India	LOCATION	with a mighty train of captives , noble chiefs and savage anthropophagi , elephants and tigers , harnessed hydras and chimeras dire .

		That any man , living under the security of modern laws and in the comfort of modern society , should venture into the dens and lairs of all the wild animals of criticism of all
Europe	LOCATION	and , engag - ing them single-handed , should bring them forth to the light for our horror or our mirth , makes us think better of our species .

		In all soberness , Professor Saintsbur/s scholarship and industry are alike prodigious ; and not less remarkable are the ease and unfailing gayety with which the -RCB- ' are displayed .

		The present writer can only claim acquaint - ance with the greater of the critics with whom Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	deals .

		Of others he can say with
Shelley	PERSON	, '' I looked on them nine sev - eral days , and then I saw that they were bad . ''

		Nevertheless , with acknowledgements for intel - lectual obligations and deference for superior scholarship , he must join issue with the his - torian of criticism on some points of doctrine .

		Even the historian of a subject may be mistaken or blinded by partisanship .

		The late
George Henry Ijewes 's History of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	is one of the cleverest books of its kind , -- but it is a review of metaphysics by a man who was inca - pable of knowing what metaphysics meant .

		I would not venture to intimate anything of the sort in regard to Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, but so far at least in his progress he has in great measure shirked the problems of Esthetic .

		He is , indeed , rather fond of the Arnoldesque pose of being a plain man who can see very little use in the subtleties of philosophy .

		He may be right .

		But they have a saying in
South America	LOCATION	that if you twitch a liana on the bor - ders of
Bolivia	LOCATION	you will disturb the President at
Eio	ORGANIZATION	, -- so interminable and intertangled are the vines and foliage of that primeval forest .

		In the same way , one can hardly touch a ques - tion of literary art without causing a commo - tion all along the line .

		You speak of Beauty , and that brings up the problem of the Gro - tesque ; and then Horror , and the forms of Tragedy , start up beyond .

		And these matters can only be debated in the terms of gesthetic and metaphysic , -- terms which have been pol - ished and worn by twenty-five centuries of use .

		We must , for all Professor Saintshury , go to the Germans for such discussion ; or , in English , to
Bosanquet 's History of Esthetic	ORGANIZATION	, or
Sydney Colvin	ORGANIZATION	's admirable little treatise on the Fine Arts .

		But Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has a clue that leads him through the labyrinths of art , -- a magic book that protects him against the demons and misleading phantoms of philosophy .

		I remember once hearing a drunken man in a street-car discourse to himself about a repast from which he had just risen . '

		We had crackers and cheese -- and sardines -- and cheese and crackers -- and crackers and beer -- and crack - ers and cheese , ' -- so his monologue ran on .

		Similarly , at his banquet of criticism Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has had
Longinus	LOCATION	-- and Aristotle -- and
Longinus	LOCATION	-- and
Horace	PERSON	-- and
Quinti	PERSON	- lian -- and
Longinus	LOCATION	-- and
Scaliger	PERSON	and
Boileau	PERSON	-- and
Longinus	LOCATION	.

		What is there in
Longinus	LOCATION	to be so overwhelming and efficacious ? '

		Mass , I can not tell \ ' Or , in a locution of the street , which ShaJcespeare would have liked , ' Search me ! '

		The little book ' On the Sub - lime ' is a magnificent rhapsody about literature .

		It stirs one like the sound of the trumpet .

		Any man ought to write more nobly from reading it .

		But of actual teaching , its content is null .

		One might almost sum up
Longinus	LOCATION	's theory in a score of words . '

		The poet must be inspired , and he must communicate his ecstacy to his readers by means of fit and perfect words . '

		What is there wonderful in that ?

		Plato almost exactly anticipated it , and
Byron	PERSON	glimpses it in the couplet from *
Don Juan	PERSON	, ' -- ' The best of
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	Is but Intoxication ; Man , being reasonable , must get drunk . '

		Longinus 's theory is true , -- it is the truest kind of truth ; but it takes us only a short way on in the study of literature .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's affection for
Longinus	LOCATION	is only one sign of the fact that from the begin - ning he has taken sides in the great perennial conflict of criticism , -- the conflict between idea and form .

		His denial of the supremacy of design , his negation of matter , his love for the mot propre , are completing indications .

		One can hardly write on such matters without tak - ing sides ; but an historian should be impartial .

		And however the literary critics may divide on this question , it is certain that Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has the great writers against him .

		It would seem that the supreme masters , having for their birthright the gift of language , or soon 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, acquiring it , never tire of pouring contempt on the traffickers in phrase and word .

		Shake - speare 's first comedy , ' Love 's - Labor Lost , ' is largely devoted to the ridicule of the phrase - mongers , the language refiners of his day .

		He makes Pistol caricature
Marlowe	PERSON	's strutting speech .

		He interrupts the preciosity of Polo - nius with ' more matter with less art . '

		Osric offends Hamlet , and Hotspur can not down with the fine speeches of the perfumed courtier .

		It is the same with
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		He devotes two plays , the * Precieuses Ridicules ' and the ' Femmes Savantes / to setting forth for all time the absurdities of preciosity and pedantry in style .

		And he makes Alceste offend Oronte by prefer - ring the plain , simple old ballad-style to the wonderful word concoctions of that pseudo poet .

		Goethe , in his autobiography , laughs at image-hunters and writers who imagine adject - ives will do the work of ideas .

		Practically all the discussions in his correspondence with
Schiller	PERSON	are discussions about ideas .

		Neither of these poets seems to have taken much more thought for language than birds do for the notes they utter .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	, a great critic as well as philosopher , says again and again that it is weight of matter , and that alone , which makes style .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, towards the end of his life , said to a friend , ' The young men come to me and think I can teach them style !

		Style !

		Let them have something to say , and say it clearly and concisely , and they will have style . '

		What more , indeed , could they need ?

		If you have something to say 5 ` ou are original , and if you can say it you are an artist , -- and there 's an end o n't .

		Yet Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	seems to think that words , divested of matter and devoid of design , may somehow form themselves into things of beauty , -- may become style .

		It is the theory of the spontaneous evolution of the universe , in miniature .

		Eather curiously , the least satisfactory part , historically , of Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's work is his treatment of the great stylistic delusion which began with
Marino	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	, and was spread by Lylly and the Euphuists in
England	LOCATION	, by
Gongora	ORGANIZATION	in
Spain	LOCATION	, and by the Ladies of the
Hotel Eambouillet	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		He deals with it , of course , but hardly attaches the importance to it that it deserves , in the way of terrible example .

		It was the first widespread adoration of the word in literature ; the second is in operation to-day .

		We have again the refinements and subtleties of language , -- the nuance , the ' impression , ' the ' symbol , ' the mot propre .

		All those are simply our old euphuistic friends with fresh-washed faces .

		Authors again call on their friends to behold the birth of a phrase , as Kings used to bring tbeir courtiers into the Queen 's chamber to witness the delivery of a prince .

		Writers explain to us how hard they labor with words , in order to make us see and feel and smell the objects they describe .

		The really great writer simply has a soul filled with passions , emotions , thoughts .

		He expresses them , he cares little how , -- and the world has a posses - sion forever .

		Is there anything much more ridiculous than the theory of the mot propre as formulated by
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	and other French writers ?

		That each idea or object has one sole and only word belonging to it , -- that they are like
Plato	PERSON	's original round four-armed and four-legged ani - mal , which the gods cut in half and so made man and woman , who have been hunting each other ever since , -- or , a better resemblance , that they are like the ticket num ^ ber and the prize in the two wheels of the lottery ; such is the famous mot propre delusion .

		The writers who adopt it will not accept the fact that words are merely arbitrary sounds or signs to denote ideas and things .

		Adam named all the creatures in the beginning , and if we only had his nomenclature there might be something in the sacred conjugal coupling of words and things .

		But the tower of Babel put an end to all that .

		It is futile and pedantic to give examples of the arbitrariness of words ; but one or two may be worth while .

		I take the names applied to the ocean .

		In Greek we have Thalatta ; in
Latin	LOCATION	, Mare or A equor ; in German , Meer ; and in English , sea .

		^ Vhich of those is the mot propre for the ocean ?

		Or take the French word ondoyant and the Eng - lish equivalent waving .

		To my fancy both of these words have , what is very rare , a quality of sound indicative of the meaning .

		But if one of them is the sole and only word to denote the thing , what is the other ?

		Of course , what the French writers mean by the mot propre , though they do not say so , is the phrase rather than the single word .

		But the phrase is a matter of asso - ciation of ideas .

		Give two writers of equal talent the same thing to describe , and they will certainly describe it differently , but very likely equally well .

		And this is necessary ; for if it were not the ease , if there were only certain inevitable words to describe each idea or thing -- then there would soon ensue that Finality of expression which Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	very rightly dreads .

		The proper words for every - thing would soon be caught ; lists would be drawn up , and tabulated , and there would be an end of literature .

		If Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	is more certain of one thing than of any other , it is that pleasure is the sole end of art , and that beauty is the means by which it achieves its purpose .

		He says of
Milton	LOCATION	's theodicy , that ` it is a noble error . '

		One would like to know what
Milton	PERSON	would have said of him , --
Milton	PERSON	, who thought that in order to write a noble poem one must first achieve a noble life ;
Milton	PERSON	, who said that
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		26S he ' dared be known to think our sage and serious Spenser a better teacher of moral excel - lence than
Aquinas	PERSON	or
Augustine	PERSON	' ;
Milton	PERSON	, who wrote his great poem to vindicate the ways of God to man .

		One would like to know , too , what
Dante	ORGANIZATION	would have said to Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	enlisting him , on the score of a few careless sentences , in the ranks of the followers of beauty and preciosity , --
Dante	PERSON	, whose mind more than that of any other man was filled with images of gloom and horror ; who valued words mainly as weapons with which to smite his foes , or as torches to reveal his God .

		A moment 's examination of any absolutely supreme piece of literature will show , it seems to me , the falsity of the theory that pleasure is the end of art , beauty the means .

		Take , for instance , '
King Lear	PERSON	, ' possibly the most tre - mendous exhibition of creative energy which exists in literature .

		Beauty may be dismissed at once as having much concern with this work .

		Save in a few scenes relating to
Cordelia	LOCATION	or Kent , there is no beauty in the action .

		There is little beauty even in the language .

		Shakespeare troubles himself not at all with melodies or harmonies , with pictures of charm or perfection .

		The verse shrills and crashes and rolls in deafen - ing discord over a blasted and ruined world .

		Psychical deformities , physical horrors , mad - nesses and deaths , are piled one upon another .

		Everything is wrapped in the hues of earth - quake and eclipse .

		That beauty is the body of such a work , pleasure its purpose , it is monstrous to think .

		The words are absurd in their inadequacy , almost banality .

		Were all the critics of
Christendom	LOCATION	to accept such a theory , I would not accept it .

		And we do not have to accept it .

		Aristotle 's view , that the use of tragedy is for purification , discipline , instruc - tion , training in heroism and virtue , is much nearer the mark .

		The notion that pleasure is the end of art is akin to the selfish view of ethics which postulates that men will make no effort , will put forth no energj ^ , save for their own good .

		• It is not so .

		Duty and Honor are in the world .

		It is not exactly for pleasure that men are being killed or mangled on the glacis or in the fortress of
Port Arthur	LOCATION	.

		It is not exactly for pleasure that Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	and his alien comrades push into the icy deserts of the north .

		It was not exactly for pleasure , I imagine , that Professor
Saintsbur	PERSON	\ ' himself has poked into the literary dust-bins of twenty-four centuries in order to write his book .

		And it is not for pleasure solely , or largely , that we deal with literature .

		We do not read the great poets and philosophers because we viT -RRB- uld , but because we must .

		They not only fascinate , they com - mand ; they do not only delight , they dominate .

		If at times we are their masters , and sit in pleasant ease lulled by their pipings and their songs , at other times we are their slaves and do their errands and bear their messages through the world .

		In one of the best passages of his book Pro- fessor
Saintsbur	PERSON	-RCB- ^ adjures us to throw away the notion of Finality in literature , to discard the tyranny of rules and kinds , to do away with tradition and authority , and accept what novel theories or fresh forms of art may offer them - selves to us and judge them on their own merits .

		It is well and justly urged .

		Partisans of the past are usually foes of the future .

		Yet how are we to Icnow the good and true in the innumerable novelties which are offered us ?

		Are we , like
Falstaff	ORGANIZATION	's Lion , certain to recognize the true Prince ?

		It is quite doubtful .

		Inherited traditions and trained tastes are at least powerful helps to correct judgment ; and though hard to get at and difficult to hold , there are standards of measurement more certain than the foot of the reigning King .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	recommends us to apply the queries ' Why ? '

		and ' Why Not ? '

		alike to old rules and new theories of art .

		Let us do so , by all means ; but let us take a wide enough cast in answering them .

		In
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	today the militant , dominant writers hold theories of art which , I imagine , must offend everyone of Professor
Saintebury	PERSON	's instincts and convictions .

		To these writers ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Keats	PERSON	, are already classics as cold in their remote - ness as the Greeks .

		To them , the criticism of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	is as antiquated as the neo-classical criticism is to Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	.

		To them prose is a better medium of expression than verse , -- ^ poetry being , indeed , in their view , as obsolete as the garments of our grandfathers .

		To them , the final and finest forms of literature are either the long novel mirroring the dull facts of life with painful accuracy , or the short story - modeled after the newspaper paragraph , and like the flash of a policeman 's lantern on some sordid scene .

		I do not think any of these beliefs will please Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	; but how is he going to defend us from them , if he throws overboard tradition , authority , and comparison with the past ?

		THE DIAL 265 quoted all the above for the sake of mere hilarity .

		It is a serious matter for this country that it should be possible for a body of men of undoubted high ability and wide reputation to put forth such a scheme , heralded in such a manner .

		To me , it seems from beginning to end in the most wretched taste ; yet it can not so seem to the promoters , who are no innocents from an unswept comer of the world .

		Probably it will seem all right to a large section of the public .

		If I am wrong , may I be forgiven ; but frankly , I should despair of a nation to which the prospectus of the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	appeared a fit and natural thing .

		Setting aside the ques - tion of taste , it appears to me to be nonsense .

		Every scientific man believes in the correspon - dence method , conducts a correspondence school himself .

		I have nothing against the method in reason ; but to advance the view that education by correspondence is a fit substitute for per - sonal contact is a totally different matter .

		It is the result of a mechanical conception of edu - cation which is the natural and hateful product of a commercial age .

		Moreover , even if it were possible to teach as well through the mails as any other way , where is the faculty to come from ?

		Money will not multiply the really first class men in the countr
-RCB- %	PERCENT	and what is more , such men will not follow the methods of the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	, which would be extremely wasteful of their time and energy .

		It is all very well to be a trustee or the chairman of a faculty , but it is not without reason that we hear nothing about the names of the actual teachers .

		Prob - ably the faculties Avill really contain some well - known names , but of necessity the work of teaching , where ' You may start at any time .

		There are no regular classes ; you will be in a class by yourself will have to be turned over to the mules of the profession .

		There is undoubtedly a useful field for a cor - respondence-school in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		A body of reasonably competent men , able to consult the national libraries and collections and extract desired information therefrom , would be very serviceable .

		A great amount of such work is done by the Government Bureaus , and I think very properly and usefully ; but it might very well be supplemented by an institution charging fees for work not properly within the scope of the government , or too extensive for it to under - take .

		I formerly hoped that the
Carnegie Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution might do this sort of work , and if the
I. C. U.	LOCATION	can settle down to this or any other reasonable field of activity we may be duly thankful .

		If it can then find a more acceptable name , we may even come to regard it with affection : -- but it was asked of old , how shall the leopard change his spots ?

Jackson	PERSON	favored , while he appreciated the quality of his manhood ; the appreciative sketch of Mr.
W. Gr	PERSON	.

		Brown ; and the studies of
Jackson	LOCATION	to be found in the his - tories of the times .

		Still there is room for a new study of this remarkable man from the point of view of today , and the greatness of his influence upon the development of our institu - tions and our political life would seem to demand it .

		Mr.
Buell	PERSON	, who did not live to see his book in print , has written with enthusiasm for his subject , and has put into the work a great amount of labor ; but he can hardly be said to have met the demand for a modern life of
Jack	PERSON	- son .

		His letters show that from the reading of his first book at the age of seven years , -- Judge
Alexander Walker	PERSON	's *
Jackson	PERSON	and
New Orleans	LOCATION	, ' -- when his imagination and his interest were captured , the personality and achievements of General
Jackson	PERSON	have been a life-study with Mr.
Buell	PERSON	, and that he has not only read everything in print or manuscript that he could find concerning him , but that an even more important part of his preparation for writing this book were personal interviews with many of those who had known General
Jackson	PERSON	as friends and acquaintances ; and some of these interviews bring out the personality of the subject most vividly .

		The book is very interesting , for Mr.
Buell	PERSON	's long experience in newspaper work has taught him how to tell a story well , and the career of
Jackson	PERSON	furnishes material that even a poor writer could hardly make uninteresting .

		But with all his facility as a writer , and his study and loving care in working out the story of
Jackson	PERSON	's life , he fails through lack of judicial fairness to make a biography which shall satisfy the thoughtful student of our national life .

		W ^ hile he seems to try to be fair , he has adopted many of
Jackson	PERSON	's own prejudices , and the book fails to ring true for this reason .

		And to some of these prejudices he gives expression so often that the reader loses sympathy with him in his narrative .

		In a letter quoted by the publishers in their preface to the work , he says : ' It is at least an American book -- not an Eng - lish one , like
Parton	PERSON	's .

		I could not have writ - ten an Anglomaniac book if I had tried ; but if I had tried and succeeded , it would not have been
Jackson	PERSON	. '

		It is hard for him to mention
England	LOCATION	without a fling at her arrogance , her greed , and her duplicity ; and he gloats over her failures and misfortunes in her relations with us , as
Jackson	PERSON	himself did .

		Mr.
Buell	PERSON	also shares
Jackson	PERSON	's hatred for Clay and
Cal	LOCATION	- houn , and sees for the most part only petti - fogging partisanship in their acts .

		Kew Eng - land and her statesmen also seem to irritate him , and he shows very little veneration for
Webster	PERSON	and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, though there is in his comments on them nothing of the venom that he has put into whatever he has to say of
Jackson	PERSON	's special foes .

		Of course these prejudices narrow the work and destroy much of its value as .

		a contribu - tion to history ; but after making allowanioes for these defects , we are glad to commend it as a most interesting study of the personality and character of this great leader of the plain peo - ple in their upward march to the control of their government .

		Most accounts of
Jackson	PERSON	's early life have made it appear vulgar and sordid in its ignorance , poverty , and recklessness .

		Mr.
Buell	PERSON	has so shaped his account as to remove this impression , while agreeing substantially with his predecessors as to the facts ; and we think that he has presented to us the real
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	.


Jackson	PERSON	's surroundings were indeed crude and primitive ; but he shared these limitations with the best people of his section and time , and his ability to meet with distinc - tion all the social demands of his later career , not only in
Tennessee	LOCATION	but in
New Orleans	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, goes to show that Mr.
Buell	PERSON	is right .

		It may also be said , in passing , that Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	, -- or ` Aunt
Kachel	PERSON	, ' as everyone called her who knew her , -- is shown to be by no means the vulgar frontierswoman that she has been pictured ; although a frontierswoman in the same sense in which her husband was a frontiersman , she had the good sense and help - ful spirit that made her universally loved where she Avas known .

		And she was equal to the social demands of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, though not ready in mature years to adapt herself to the far dif - ferent social environment of the national capital ; from the necessity of this change death freed her just as she was to depart for
Washington	LOCATION	to become the mistress of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Buell	PERSON	makes no attempt to cover the faults of
Jackson	PERSON	's character .

		His impetuous - ness , his readiness to fight on small provocation and to kill his opponent if that opponent had touched the sensitive spots in his being , his ineradicable prejudices , his readiness toi impute the worst motives to any persons , however exalted in character or position , who opposed him or who disagreed with him on public ques - tions , his arbitrary conduct in office , overriding the instructions of his superiors and the law that limited his power , -- all of these faults , and many others , are evident to one who reads this book .

		Yet the author does not dwell upon them as do hostile writers , while he is always ready to plead extenuating circumstances and conditions .

		In this attitude toward his subject we agree with him ; for the best possible case should always be made out for one who has held high place in power and in the love of the people .

		As a study of the man
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, the work is to be highly commended ; for the author has made his character , his per - sonal qualities , and his surroundings stand out clearly before the readers , by his skill as a writer working on material that he has mastered by close and sympathetic study .

		It not only discloses to us the man himself in his externals and in the broader lines of his character , but it gives us a picture of life and conditions in the
Southwest	LOCATION	in
the first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	that is distinctly valuable .

		The story of the development of society from frontier conditions to the settled life of
Jackson	PERSON	's later days , with the passions and prejudices of the early society of that region , is one of great interest , and it is well told .

		Especially interesting is the account of the brilliant victory at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, which could so easily have been a defeat and have lost us the great
Louisiana Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		We would call attention t © what is told of the designs of the British government to get possession of that vast region , whatever the
Treaty of Ghent	ORGANIZATION	might say as to the restoration of conditions to the state before the war .

		It was supposed that the great expedition could not fail ; the signature of the trea.ty was delayed until
New Orleans	LOCATION	must have been seized , as the British commissioners thought , and then the British were to refuse to - give up
Louisiana	LOCATION	on the ground that the successive Spanish and French cessions were void .

		While this plan of the British has been disclosed in official documents , it has not so far been set forth in popular works ; and Mr.
Buell	PERSON	, writing as he does in hostility to
England	LOCATION	, makes mucli of what he calls British treachery in sending the expedi - tion for this purpose after the commissioners had already assembled at
Ghent	ORGANIZATION	to draw up a treaty of peace .

		THE DIAL , 267 A Biography of the Mixd .

		* Within a volume of less than four hundred pages , Prof.
Edward Dowden	PERSON	has told with leisurely exactness the story of
Browning	PERSON	's life , has unfolded the growth of his character and poetic art , and has given careful study to many of his more complex poems .

		The editor of the series of ' Temple Biographies , ' the Rev.
Dugald Macfadyen	PERSON	, in prefacing this volume , has chosen
Gladstone	PERSON	's phrase for apt illustra - tion , -- ' a biography of the mind . '

		The author also emphasizes this special aim .

		While trac - ing the inward development of the poet , how - ever , he has introduced all the relevant outside influences which incited or accompanied each special period of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's poetic expression .

		Thus the work makes appeal not alone to earn - est readers of the poet , but also to the many who share the sentiments of
Frederick Tenny	PERSON	- son , and of
Jowett of Balliol	ORGANIZATION	, that
Browning	PERSON	was ' a man of infinite learning , jest , and bon - hommie , ' with ' a sterling heart that reverbs no hollowness , ' but that his poetry is ' extrava - gant , perverse , and topsy-turvy . '

		The volume is a model of biographical conscience and good taste .

		If the sympathy of the critic at times exceeds his judgment , the offense is seldom flagrant .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's cordial relations with the
Brownings	PERSON	, and his ardent study of the poet for half a century , tend to make him a generous rather than a censorious critic .

		Realizing this tendency , perhaps , he twice addresses his readers in
Browning	PERSON	's lines from * Balaustion 's Adventure ' : ' If I , too , should try and speak at times .

		Leading your love to where my love , perchance , Climbed earlier , found a nest before you knew .

		Why , bear with the poor climber , for love 's sake . '

		Since the publication of Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	's standard guide-book to
Browning	PERSON	's life and poetry , many valuable testimonies to his manly traits and his artistic development have appeared in volumes of letters by both
Browning	PERSON	and his wife , and in reminiscences and correspondence of many of their intimate friends , notably the Rossettis ,
Milsand	LOCATION	, Story , and Mrs. ^ ronson .

		Of such illuminative data Professor
Dowden	PERSON	has made discreet but liberal use , and has pre - sented the man and poet in a series of vivid chronological portrayals .

		The first distinct analysis deals with the young man , vigorous , ambitious , speculative , who as poet has paid homage to
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, and has spoken his first tentative message to the world in a trilogy of strange dramatic studies , '
Pauline	PERSON	, ' '
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	, ' and ' Sordello . '

		With a similar motive , but in diverse settings , these studies in verse all depict the flaws in the full develop - ment of genius , all tell the story of aspiration , •

		apparent failure , and spiritual victory .

		The young poet is clearly defined , with his rare promises and his defects , some of the latter due to immaturity and soon to disappear , others to linger , increase , and hamper his effectiveness in all his later work .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	does not spend futile effort in condemning or con - doning the rhetorical leaps and chasms in ' Sordello , ' but says with refreshing candor , ' Intelligent , however , as
Browning	PERSON	was , it implied a curious lack of intelligence to sup - pose that a poem of many thousand lines writ - ten in shorthand would speedily find decipher - ers . '

		The second significant portrait is that of Bro ^ vning ' the Maker of Plays . '

		His social circle has widened , but his poetic method is still experimental to a large extent .

		With reserve and fairness .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	recites the familiar facts regarding the presentation of ' Strafford ' and ' A Blot on the ` Scutcheon , ' with the consequent loss of
Macready	PERSON	's friend - ship for many years .

		Over the ever-present question , ^ Are
Browning	PERSON	's plays adapted for stage use ? '

		the critic lingers for a time , but evades a direct answer .

		To some enthusiasts on the subject , he will seem disappointing , but many of his statements will meet general assent . '

		In the development of his dramatic style .


Browning	PERSON	more and more lost sight of the theatre and its requirements ; his stage became more and more a stage of the mind .

		The hastily written `` A Blot on the ` Scutcheon '' is perhaps of all
Browning	PERSON	's dramas the best fitted for theatrical representation .

		Yet it is incur - ably weak in the motives which determine the action ; and certain passages are almost ludi - crously undramatic ' With truth he regards the Dramatic Lyrics , especially '
Pippa Passes	PERSON	' and ' My Last Duchess , ' as far superior poetically to the more ambitious dramas .

		He invents a para - graph of skilful , if not quite logical , antithesis between ` static and dynamic drama , ' the one dealing with ` characters in positions , ' the other with * characters in movement . ' '

		The dramatic genius of
Browning	PERSON	was in the main of the static kind .

		It studies with extraordinary skill and subtlety character in position ; it attains only an imperfect or a labored success with character in movement . '

		A few years passed before
Browning	PERSON	stood forth as the poet of ' Christmas Eve ' and ` Easter Day , ' interpretations , possibly arguments , of the ' spiritual life individual ' and ' the spiritual life corporate . '

		During the intervening years , vital events had happened to unfold the ix > et 's heart and soul .

		Of the romance of these ' two wild poets but wise people , ' the biographer speaks with tender deference , fusing much material from the published love-letters of the poets and the later journal-records by Mrs. 268 THE DIAL .

Browning	PERSON	of those first happy months in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		After years of unexpressed poetic growth , ' Men and Women ' appeared in
1855	DATE	, revealing the broadened experiences and the assimilated cul - ture of the years of Italian residence .

		Of the exuberance of life and passion in these varied types of poems , with motives of love , art , and religion .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	speaks with delight .

		For E'ossetti , they were his ' Elixir of Life , ' but to
Kuskin	PERSON	they seemed ' a mass of conundrums . '

		Such diverse sentiments may well apply to the two moods which are represented even to-day among
Browning	PERSON	's readers .

		After careful study of ' The Statue and the Bust , ' with its proble - matic test of soul-languor , Professor
Dowden	PERSON	adds , ' Had
Tennyson	PERSON	treated the same sub ^ ject , he would probably have glorified their action as a victorious obedience to the law of self - reverence and self-control . '

		It has pleased some sentimental writers and many readers to image
Browning	PERSON	as a sad , brooding man , after Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's death .

		Such an aspect is untrue to the facts , unjust to
Browning	PERSON	's character , and to his sense of duty to his family , his friends , and the fast - increasing circle of his admirers .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	has emphasized and justified , through passages in ' Fifine at the Fair , ' the new zest and productiveness of the poet 's long life , while he cherished with silent devotion the sacred memories of the past .

		The critic has traced the use of material gathered during the years in
Italy	LOCATION	, the many incentives which now were expressed from ' Mr.
Sludge	PERSON	, the Medium ' and ' The Ring and the Book ' to the later classical poems .

		There is a long , perhaps needlessly detailed , analysis of ^ The Ring and the Book . '

		The spiritual relations between
Pompilia	LOCATION	and
Caponssachi	PERSON	are strongly illumined .

		Nearly all readers will echo his verdict , that here the poet reached the acme of his art , that here he concentrated all his powers , his research , pas - sion , casuistry , tenderness and pity , robust humour , worldly knowledge and spiritual aspi - rations .

		Many were the poems of the
last thirty years	DATE	from which the biographer-critic has chosen a few to express the poet 's maturing attainments , -- ' Balustion 's Adventure ' and ` Aristophanes ' Apology ' with buoyancy of soul and unflagging energ -RCB- ^ of imagination , ` La Saisiaz ' with its moan of virile sorrow ending with ' the conclusion with BrowTiing of the whole matter , ' -- ' Hope the arrowy , just as constant , comes to pierce its gloora , compelled By a power and a purpose which , if no one else beheld , I behold in life , so -- hope ! '

		Pen-portraits by friends of later years reveal
Browning	PERSON	as the teacher and poet of old age .

		In the later volumes there may be ' much mere grey argument , ' but there are also flashes of spiritual insight in ' Pisgah-Sights ' and ` Aso - lando . '

		There are terse well-weighed sen - tences of summary on individual poems of later composition , as well as a study of the more familiar works , thus giving a hand-book value to this volume .

		In the last chapter there is a broad survey of
Browning	PERSON	's defects and rank .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	reiterates the poet 's weakness in action and narrowness in characterization compared with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, naming
Browning	PERSON	as a possible successor of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, ` not indeed as an artist but as a teacher . '

		One may demur at certain opinions regarding
Browning	PERSON	's literary creed and forms , yet there will be assent to this summary of his influence upon his readers : ' He plays upon the will , summoning it from lethargy to activity .

		He spiritualizes the passions by showing that they tend through what is human towards what is divine .

		He assigns to the intellect a sufficient field for exercise , but attaches more value to its efforts than to its attainments .

		His faith in an unseen order of things creates a hope which persists through the apparent failures of earth . '

		THE DIAL , 269 there is ample popular literature to set forth the problems and their solution .

		Professor
Kent	PERSON	's present work is volume one in a series of six , designed to cover the Old Testament .

		Its aim is , ' -LRB- 1 -RRB- to re-arrange the writings of the Old Testament in a logical order , -LRB- 2 -RRB- to indicate their approximate dates and the classes of writers from which they come , and the more important reasons for the critical analysis of the different books , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- to introduce the reader by means of a clear translation to the beauty and thought of the original , ' with notes of interpretation , and other notations to make clear the thought of the original .

		The introduction is a compre - hensive discussion of the traditions of
Israel	LOCATION	, their transmission , and their crystallization into literature .

		It is with this literature that the author deals ; and consequently he must assign each document to its proper time and place in
Israel	LOCATION	's history .

		The body of the book presents in parallel columns , where more than one story of an event exists , the text of the required narratives .

		By a subtle acxunen the texts have been separated and thrown into parallels , or otherwise , to give the popular reader a true idea of the supposed sources of the narratives of the books covered by this volume .

		The appendix supplies a full-enough bibliography , characteristics of the narratives , and several translations of Babylonian stories parallelled in thought to Genesis .

		The author is to be con - gratulated on the completion of so colossal a task , and Bible students on such a complete crystallization of the present status of the literary and historical criticism of the early narratives of the Old Testatment .

		The work of the Eev .


J. C. Todd	PERSON	on ' Politics and Eeligion in
Ancient Israel	LOCATION	' is another pop - ular treatment of Old Testament literature .

		The author 's rough-and-ready style , his ten - dency to rid himself of hackneyed methods of writing and of trite statements , give a fresh flavor to a work of this kind .

		He has a new angle of vision , from which he often gives his readers a pleasing view of the situation .

		His opening statement is , ' The Old Testament is the epos of the Fall of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	' -LRB- p. 1 . -RRB-

		.

		Around this event the author 's interest centres , as he drives his pen through the Old Testament from Genesis to
Malachi	LOCATION	.

		The book is full of statements , familiar to scholars in this field , but startling and even reactionary to some lay - men in
Bible Study	LOCATION	.

		The author seems to take it for granted that his words require no proof , that his ipse dixit is final to his readers .

		This method may be necessary for condensation , but to be conclusive it should be provided either with references as proofs , or with somewhat larger elaboration of the topics discussed .

		One of the contentions of the book is that
Israel	LOCATION	was but one of the nations of antiquity , and that ' the religion of
Israel	LOCATION	is one of the bases on which the modern world rests ' -LRB- p. 308 -RRB- .


Israel	LOCATION	's contribution to humanity is an ethical religion , as based on the records of the Scrip - tures .

		The New Testament is not the beginning of ethics and theology ; every page of it carries us back to the Old . '

		It is no paradox to say that in one sense the
New Testament	LOCATION	is simply a foot note to the Old , telling us that every - thing there written is to be understood of our Lord Jesus Christ ... He is the suffering Servant
Israel	LOCATION	, and he is
Israel	LOCATION	's Messianic Bang ; he is the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, the sacrificial Victim , the High Priest .

		In a word , the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment is the Book of God made man ; and that God is the God already revealed in the whole political and social nexus of the time ' -LRB- p. 310 -RRB- .

		The theme is one rich with thought , and awaits a full and adequately equipped discussion that will convincingly carry with it the mind of the honest truth-seeking student of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The Psalms are the most universally revered portions of the Old Testament .

		They are mir - rors 0 - the human soul , and hence touch man in almost every experience in life .

		Their thought is not limited to any age , nation , or religious creed .

		They have been highly prized for their spiritual inspiration , by individuals , by religious societies , by armies , and by nations , for many centuries .

		They have been material for thought , for extensive speaking and writ - ing , and for the most determined and vigorous action when required .

		The distinguished author of ' The Psalms in Human Life , ' Mr.
Eowland	PERSON	E ,
Prothero	PERSON	, has been in no hurry to publish his book , for his activity in collecting the material for it has extended over more than twenty-five years .

		His plan of work was , for example , to gather from the most distinguished church fathers all the hints and direct state - ments that would in any way bear on the Psalms .

		Passing from this period , he takes up the same items touching the formation of the nations .

		The middle ages , the reformation era , the struggle between
Protestant England	ORGANIZATION	and
Eoman Catholic	ORGANIZATION
Spain	LOCATION	, the Huguenots , the Puritans , the Scottish Covenanters , and the revolution of
1688	DATE	, are periods and movements that called to the front some of the richest spirits and the sturdiest spiritual characters that the world has produced .

		These giant fighters for truth have made frequent and large use of the choicest of the Psalms , both for their own personal encouragement and for the inspir - ation of their valorous supporters .

		The author has carefully gathered the facts from a great mass of history and literature , and has deftly woven them into a bit of delightful narrative .

Patrick Gass	PERSON	has never been written high in the list of American authors .

		What little fame he did acquire through the publication of his Journal , written while a ser - geant on the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition , was likely to perish when the book long since disap - peared from print .

		A reprint of the diary of the hardy frontiersman has now been made , happily supplementing the recent republication of the complete official journal of the expedi - tion by the same publishers ,
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Placed side by side , the two accounts of the incidents of the famous jour - ney exactly fit into each other .

		The one is writ - ten from the standpoint of the scientific explorers who headed the column , and the other from tliat of the rank and file .

		From the excellent Introduction to the vol - ume , written by Mr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	, one gathers that
Patrick Gass	PERSON	, by descent a son of old
Ireland	LOCATION	, was a carpenter by trade , whom adversity or choice had driven into our regular army .

		When Captain
Lewis	PERSON	was making up the quota of select spirits to accompany him in his quest of a northwestern route to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, he included Private
Gass	PERSON	, then stationed at the L ^ nited States government post near
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	, chiefly because of his skill with the broadaxe .

		Since the party took no tents and expected to spend one or two winters on the journey , the advis - ability of including some artisan experienced in hewing and joining timbers was not to be over - looked .


Gass	PERSON	was the last man chosen for the expedition , and probably the oldest member of it except Captain
Clark	PERSON	.

		Yet he was only thirty - two !

		Young -RSB- -RRB- lood was needed for such adventurous work .

		the expedition , and of their subsequent careers as far as investigators have been able to trace them .


Gass	PERSON	, who had risen to the rank of ser - geant while on the expedition , saw service in the War of
1812	DATE	, then became a jack-of-all-trades of intemperate habits , married at sixty , fathered seven children , and died as late as
1870	DATE	, at the age of ninety-nine .

		His career has been often parallelled .

		It is the story of the courageous and hardy frontiersman , strong in everything except personal control .

		In some respects , the general reader will pre - fer the descriptions of
Gass	PERSON	to the official rec - ords .

		Gass never made those long excursions into the fields of natural history which the nature of the expedition required from its lead - ers .

		He never troubled himself with long descriptions of the various unknown animals captured or killed , or the peculiar and interest - ing plants found .

		He is concerned with stray horses , annoyed by parted tow-lines , and ` nearly devoured alive ' by mosquitoes .

		Tar must be made for pitching the boats , and salt must be procured from the savages or boiled from springs or ocean water ; the heavy game which the hunters killed must be carried to camp , and the wet baggage must frequently be unloaded and dried or carried over portages .

		This was the work which fell to
Sergeant Gass	PERSON	and his fellows .

		Small leisure was afforded them for scientific investigations .

		Frequently the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	records men - tiqn how uncomplainingly the men bore their privations .

		The cheerful tone of Sergeant
Gass	PERSON	under the most trying circumstances is evident .

		When there was food , they feasted ; when there was none , they fasted .

		At one time , the natives assured the whites that they had not more roots and provisions than they themselves needed , but they drove up some horses to be shot .

		After killing one , they were offered another . '

		That was reserved , ' says
Gass	PERSON	, * until another time , and we dressed the one we had killed ; and in our situation we find it very good eating . '

		Camping one night in a rain which turned to snow , they found themselves next morning ' lying in the plains , the snow about five inches deep ; and amidst snow and frost , we have noth - ing to eat .

		Without breakfast , we started to go to a village of natives , who live on a branch of the river . '

		On another occasion , ' Our stock of provisions is exhausted , and we have nothing but some roots , which we get from the natives at a very dear rate . '

		When one of the number fell sick , Captain
Lewis	PERSON	was ' obliged to bleed him with a penknife , having no other instru - ment at this camp . '

		Never were the hardships of tlie explorers too great , or the anxiety about their situation too keen , to prevent their Americanism showing itself , especially on the national holidays .

		We fired a swivel at sunrise in honour of the clay and continued the voyage ; passed a creek on the north side , called
Pond Creek	ORGANIZATION	, and at one o'clock stopt to dine .

		One of our people got snake bitten , but not dangerously .

		After dinner we renewed our voyage , passed a creek on the north side , which we called INDE - PENDENCE , encamped on the north side at an old Indian village situated in a handsome prairie and saluted the departing day with another gun . '

		But in tlie abominable weather , and surrounded by thieving Indians , the leaders were not moved to raptures .


Gass	PERSON	is even more matter of fact .

		He records : `
Friday 15th	DATE	.

		This morning the weather appeared to settle and clear off , but the river remained still rough .

		So we were obliged to continue here until about 1 o'clock , when the weather became more calm , and we loaded and set out from our disagreeable camp ; went about 3 miles , when we came to the mouth of the river , where it empties into a handsome bay .

		Here we halted on a sand beach , formed a comfortable camp , and remained in full view of the ocean , at this time more raging than pacific '

		We arrived on the 23rd , ' he says , ` and were received with great kindness and marks of friendship by the inhabitants , after an absence of two years , four months and ten days . '

		The record of the adventurous Ser - geant is well worth preserving in the handsome and enduring fonn in which it now appeal 's .

		A Mediaeval Prixcess .

		* '
Jacqueline	PERSON	of
Bavaria	LOCATION	' is a name that acts like the dew of heaven upon the dryest Dutch chronicles .

		At once they bud and blossom , and what seemed but a desert is ' with sudden herb - age crowned . '

		In Dutch art and literature , and on the stage ,
Jacoba van Beijeren	PERSON	looms a mighty figure against the backgrounds of ro - mance .

		In English chronicles she is '
Dame Jake	PERSON	, ' and tlie modern Englishman 's chapter of alleged research becomes a comedy of errors when this Countess of Borselen is transformed into a glorified queen of the keramic art .

		By
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons . '

		Borselen ' furnishes the original of ' porce - lain . '

		Miss
Eutli Putnam	PERSON	, whose position in the Dutch scholarship of the English-speaking world is unique , is not led away by romance or tradition .

		She keeps amazingly cool while exploring that mediaeval age in which few mod - ern breezes of opinion blow , and where , save in the pulses and expression of the same human heart , there is little to remind one of our age of steel and coal , of machinery and the telegraph .

		Very little of admiration and not over-much of sympathy , but clear insight and determination to get at the reality , are the hall-marks of the author 's scholarly work .

		On some pages it almost seems as though she purposely refrains from being as interesting as she might , lest enthusiasm should possibly lend prismatic tints to her achromatic critical lenses .

		Never - theless the text is brisk , and the story moves brightly forward ; while for anyone with much power of imagination to construct her environ - ment in the past , the narrative makes delight - ful reading .

		As
Jacqueline	PERSON	had four husbands , she suf - fered a proportionate degree of trouble ; yet it was not her marital companions that laid on her the heaviest burdens .

		Beside having a decided will of her own , she had much misery and little enjoyment from her great possessions of land and her numerous titles ; for both these assets , in a rude age of force , excited the cupidity of her relatives .

		To read their letters , one would suppose them to be the most affectionate and unselfish creatures in the world ; but beneath their purring lay ever the beak and talons .

		Thus this mediaeval princess wore a thorny crown of sorrows during most of her short life .

		Her career was run in much less than the
first iialf of the fifteenth century	DATE	.

		Born in
1401	DATE	, at
The Hague	LOCATION	, she was thus the Daughter of Hol - land , and as such was the acknowledged and sole heir to her father , the Count ,
William the Sixth	LOCATION	, -- for neither then nor until
Napoleon	PERSON	's day did
Holland	PERSON	ever have any kings , and even in this disguised republic Dutch sovereigns of to-day wear no crown .

		Married , when little more than a child , to a youthful prince who was early poisoned , she took a second husband in
1418	DATE	; but separating from him , her case was referred to the divorce court at
Rome	LOCATION	.

		This being the time of a change in the
Papacy	LOCATION	, the case dragged for several years , while she both wooed and was wooed by an Englishman , being alternately loved and deserted by the insular Duke who was no other than
Humphrey	PERSON	, whose library is still at
Oxford	LOCATION	, a delightful home of books .

		He it was who ' magnified ' the Uni - versity of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	' with a thousand pounds worth and more of precious bokes ' -LRB- 129 in num - ber -RRB- .

		When
Christendom	LOCATION	's chief divorcer decided 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, against
Jacqueline	PERSON	, she became the Countess Militant ; and between the Cods and Hooks , leading her soldiers in battle and besieging and being besieged , while supporting the lost cause , she was a picturesque figure .

		She finally mar - ried her ' silent partner , ' the
Lord of Borselen	ORGANIZATION	, owner of a petty feudal patch of land in
Zee	LOCATION	- land .

		As to title , she became Lady Forester , with enough income to live merrily during the happiest of her marriages .

		She lived at the same time with
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	, and fought against and was finally conquered by the same men who burned one of these two women and robbed the other .

		The peasant has been suffi - ciently glorified .

		It is time the princess should be better known in the English-speaking world .

		One scarcely knows which to praise more , the patient scholarship or the attractive style of the author ; the theme of the personality here pre - sented , or the picture and suggestions of the feudal age , looking into which this book uncur - tains so many windows , and upon which it opens such pleasing vistas .

		Yet romantic and fascinating as were many of the elements mak - ing up mediaeval feudalism , this book makes one feel occasionally like falling on one 's knees in thankfulness that feudalism is dead and gone forever .

		Altogether this story of a too-pro - tected female is really more interesting in its last , perhaps its final , historical setting than in most of the romantic presentations of which we have had already too many .

		The book , besides being attractive as to contents , style , illustra - tions , and general equipment , seems to be almost perfect in its proof-reading .

		It is a pleasure to say that while Major
Gibbons	PERSON	's book is hardly in the same class as
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's most notable work , it has many excel - lent features .

		It has good pictures , a number of well-made and intelligible maps , a good pre - face and introductory chapter , and several well - prepared appendices giving a summar -RCB- ' of the important results of the expedition under the author 's leadership , -- such as
England	LOCATION	's share in African development , the natural resources and the industrial and commercial conditions of
Africa	LOCATION	that fit it for colonization , the good and the evil of missionary work there , and the administrative systems in operation .

		The author dedicates his work to the late
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, who requested the explorer to make a special study of the
Zambezi	LOCATION	country in order to determine the most desirable crossing of that river for the great
Cape	LOCATION	to
Cairo	LOCATION	Railway .

		To revert to the organization of the expedition , it is interesting to note how thoroughly Major
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- bons was equipped .

		In order to test the naviga - bility of the African rivers , he had two alum - inum launches and a barge in sections made ; and with these he continued the exploration of the
Lower Zambezi	LOCATION	, going eight hundred miles to the nearest attainable point to
Victoria Falls	LOCATION	.

		Although Major
Gibbons	PERSON	took the utmost care in selecting his company , he seems to have been followed by ill luck , losing four of his six white companions , and being constantly harassed by the desertions of his native boys .

		Yet , with a cheerful determination to ignore such hin - drances , he pushed on , following the
Zambezi	LOCATION	to its source , ' the water oozing from a black spongy bog , ' which had previously remained undiscovered , and forced his way along the Congo-Zambezi Watershed eastward through much unexplored country , until he fell in with a
Congo State	ORGANIZATION	expedition , in whose company he journeyed to a station in
Katanga	LOCATION	.

		From there he traversed the countries contingent to
Lakes Mweru	LOCATION	,
Tanganyika	LOCATION	,
Kivo	PERSON	,
Albert Edward	PERSON	,
Victoria Nyanza	PERSON	to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and thence to Khartum .

		There is much that is unusually interesting and instructive in the work , but we must confine ourselves to a single quotation , relative to the commercial prospects of
Uganda	LOCATION	and
Marotseland	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of these two countries .

		Major
Gibbons	PERSON	says : ' Excluding the small district comprising
Lake Kivo	PERSON	, two countries , more than all others , have struck me as offering the best prospects for
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean settlement .

		I refer to
Uganda	LOCATION	and
Marotse	PERSON	- land .

		Both contain large plateaus , ranging from thirty-five hundred to five thousand feet , and both are capable of growing many useful products on an extensive scale .

		Marotseland will grow cereals of various kinds , as well as rice , cotton , sugar , and rubber , to say nothing of fruits , which with sugar at a reasonable price could very easily be made the basis of an industry capable of competing with
California	LOCATION	in the rapidly growing South African
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 278 market , and of supplying jam at a higlily profitable rate .

		Cattle do better in this country than in any other part of
Africa	LOCATION	within my experience , and will amply reward a little enterprise .

		The rich undula - tions of
Uganda	LOCATION	seem to me especially adaptable to wheat-growing on a large scale . '

		Of course the one thing necessary to the development of these countriesi is the completion of the
Cape	LOCATION	to
Cairo	LOCATION	Railway , nearly half of which is now finished .

		To those who relish tales of adventure in African wilds , this book oifers many accounts of thrilling incidents with natives , lions , elephants , and buffaloes .

		While
Africa	LOCATION	has had eminent explorers like
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and
Gibbons	PERSON	to write about it , the Orient has been less adequately described .

		There is considerable assumption in the title of Mr.
Michael M. Shoemaker	PERSON	's latest book , ' The Heart of the Orient , ' yet we think it is quite justified by the contents of the work .

		The author describes a journey from
Constantinople	LOCATION	through the quaint and curious kingdom of
Georgia	LOCATION	, now a part of the Eussian empire , thence through
Armenia	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	,
Turkomania	LOCATION	, and
Turkestan	ORGANIZATION	, to the
Vale of Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, and gives vivid and satisfying pictures of the peo - ple , from the high life at the Persian court to the low life in the tents of the
Kirghez	LOCATION	, ' where the camels whispered bits of gossip from Ispahan and
Bactra	LOCATION	, and the donkeys still dream of the flight into
Egypt	LOCATION	, ' The author has , moreover , entered sufficiently into the history of the various countries to make the way plain for the reader .

		We read with interest of the reign of good Queen
Tamara	PERSON	of
Georgia	LOCATION	; of the survival of the stolid-faced Armenians through the successive persecutions of the Arabian Caliphs , the Moguls , the Persians , the Turks , and the Russians ; of the wonderful
Peacock	LOCATION	throne of
Persia	LOCATION	; of the Trans-Caspian rail - way ; of
Samarkand	LOCATION	, the poem of the Orient ; of
Bokhara	LOCATION	, with itsi barbaric splendor and squa - lor ; and , finally , of
Russia	LOCATION	's management of these far-away strands .

		The following excer -RSB- -RRB- t -- a picture of
Samarkand	LOCATION	-- will reveal the quality of the book : * Here comes an old man -- on the inevitable donkey -- wrapped in a garment of heavy crimson , brocaded with flaring yellow figures , while from his head rises a turban of green and gold that would make a Western man totter , but he sits erect .

		The heels of his pointed red slippers are pressed closely into the little beast that carries him forward with a steady trot .

		Yonder a group of turbaned mer - chants are closely inspecting a consignment from
China	LOCATION	by the great caravan routes .

		The patient camels that have toiled for so many months under its weight are asleep beneath the trees .

		Veiled women pass chattering along on patient donkeys .

		Sedate-looking storks gaze down upon us from their ancestral nests high on the leaning minerets .

		It is the Orient pure and simple , and , so far , unpolluted by the tourist element . '

		Mr.
Shoemaker	PERSON	has caught the breath and spirit of the Orient , and described it in a manner that is at once easy and well-poised .

		From the Orient to the Occident is a long jump , even in a review ; but there are parts of our own country that are almost as little known as
Persia	LOCATION	.

		Ever since the first explorers crossed the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, the
Great American Desert	ORGANIZATION	, with its strange , picturesque , mysterious scenery , has had a fascinating and romantic interest .

		ISotwithstanding it has been so often and so well described , there is still room for Mr.
Arthur J. Burdick	PERSON	's volume having the title -LRB- suggestively taken from
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's ' Ulalume ' -RRB- ' The Mystic Mid-Region . '

		Mr.
Burdick	PERSON	has himself come under the spell of the vast desert spaces , and imparts much of their weird - ness and charm to the readers of hie book .

		He tells of their wonders , their dangere and hard - ships , and the possibilities of their reclamation , with no little narrative skill .

		Speculations as to their origin and history ; tales of suffering from thirst in these waterless tracts ; descrip - tions of desert plants and animals , and of the aborigines who , apparently by some slip in the law of life , dwell there ; stories of venturesome prospectors in search of the ' yellow streak , ' with many other things , make up the contents of this interesting book .

		The following descrip - tion of
Death Valley	LOCATION	, in the
Mohave Desert	LOCATION	in
California	LOCATION	, gives a touch of the quality of the book : '
Death Valley	ORGANIZATION	has an area of nearly five hun - dred square miles .

		It is fifty miles long , and varies in width from five to ten miles .

		Its greatest depres - sion is 480 feet below sea-level .

		In this limited area , more men have perished than upon any other similar area in the world , the great battle-fields excepted .

		The remarkable mineral wealth of the region has been glittering bait to lure men to destruction .

		There are in the valley golden ledges , the ores of which run in value to fabulous sums per ton .

		There are vast beds of nitre , soda , salt , and other mineral drugs .

		There is a single salt - field in the valley , thirty miles long and from two to four miles wide , where salt lies a foot or more deep over the entire field .

		Turquoises , opals , gar - nets , onyx , marbles , and other gems and rocks of value , exist in abundance .

		The valley is a store - house of wealth , the treasure-vault of the nation , the drug-store of the universe ; but Death holds the title . '

		Mr.
Burdick	PERSON	asserts , however , that irrigation will reclaim much of this arid region to the uses of man .

		The title of Mr.
David T. Hanbury	PERSON	's book , • Sport and Travel in the
Northland of Canada	LOCATION	, * is somewhat misleading , for it suggests the common type of travel-book that tells of wander - ings in search of adventure and oddities in out - of-the-way places ; whereas the book is really a compendium of scientific research in the far Xorth of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hanbury	PERSON	spent twenty months in this almost terra incognita , concern - ing which he writes : 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ' I have always maintained that ' * Barren Ground '' is a misnomer for the Northland of Can - ada .

		No land can be called barren which bears wild - flowers in profusion , numerous heaths , luxuriant grass , in places up to the knees , and a variety of moss and lichens .

		It is barren only in the sense that it is destitute of trees ; hence the name De-chin-u-le -LRB- no trees -RRB- which is the Indian name for it . '

		In Mr.
Hanbury	PERSON	, the Eskimos have found a friend .

		He has high praise for their integrity and honesty , but he has scant praise for the Indians , whom he found to be utterly untrust - worthy .

		The value of the book is enhanced by a good introductory historical sketch of explora - tion in
North Canada	LOCATION	, by Mr.
J. P. Eenwick	PERSON	, and also by several appendices giving scientific data on the geology , the flora and fauna , the weather conditions , measurements of
Hudson Bay Eskimo	ORGANIZATION	, and an Eskimo word-and-phrase list .

		It is to be regretted that a book so well printed and profusely illustrated , and giving so much fresh information , should be written in so crude and unentertaining a manner .

		An ideal way to see a foreign country is to jaunt through it in some sort of easy-going vehicle .

		Apparently the stolkjaere of
Norway	LOCATION	, ' a two - wheel pony cart , the body of which is hung , very high , with a commodious seat for two passengers and a raised perch-like seat behind the passengers ' seat for the driver or skydgui , ' is not the worst riding-cart in the world .

		In such a cart , two men , one a modest Eambler and the other an austere Doctor of Laws , made a jolly tour in Southwestern Nor - way in
August	DATE	and
September	DATE	, months when the regular tourists , especially the German and the English species , had gone home ; and now the Rambler recounts the trips in a readable way in a little book entitled ' A Norwegian Ramble .

		He tells us that the two travellers ' crossed the country twice , once northwest to Molde , our farthest point north , and then down the coast , and in and out of the wonderful fjords , and finally southeast again through the beautiful
Valdeas	PERSON	to the capital of this strangely fascinating country ; and in all our joumeyings we never experienced aught from the natives but the greatest of courtesy , kindness , and hospital - ity . '

		Next to this uniform hospitality , the travellers were most struck by the unusual silence prevailing in the land .

		During their entire journey they did not hear the sound of bird or squirrel , and of very few dogs ; and they saw but few pigs and ' roostens .

		Perhaps the Norwegians are strangely quiet , too ; for there is no record in the book of conversation with them , -- the one thing the volume needs to enliven it .

		On the whole , however , it furnishes a sketchy account of an interesting jaunt made by two congenial men .

		The sub-title of Mr.
Frederick A. Ober	PERSON	's book on ' Our West Indian Neighbors ' runs as fol - lows : ` The islands of the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	's
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, their picturesque features , fascinating history , and attractions for the traveler , nature-lover , settler , and pleasure - seeker . '

		A title so comprehensive calls , for much in the way of fulfilment ; but the volume seems to justify it .

		Mr.
Ober	PERSON	's knowledge of affairs and conditions in the
West Indies	LOCATION	is extensive and minute .

		As a collector of birds and an adventurer in the islands in 1879-80 , as Commissioner to the W ^ orld 's Fair from the
West Indies	LOCATION	in
1891	DATE	, and as a visitor subsequent to the recent war , Mr.
Ober	PERSON	has had unusual opportunities and advantages for obtaining first-hand information , and sufficient time for studying the exact conditions of our island neighbors in that quarter .

		The volume is not limited to
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	, but includes all the important islands even to the Barbadoes and
Trinidad	LOCATION	, treating the inhabitants , the climate , the commercial and industrial features , the sights of town and country , and the local and foreign governments , of each .

		As our interest in the islands is largely commercial , the concluding words of Mr.
Ober	PERSON	in his book are pertinent : ' There is no denying the fact that , with the exception of
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Puerto Eico	PERSON	, possibly of
Trinidad	LOCATION	, the West Indian islands have retrograded in the past century .

		They have grown poorer , the British islands especially , their population blacker , hence they are less desirable as places of residence for white folk . '

		We close our present list of travel-books with a consideration of the Rev. Dr.
W. W. Moore	PERSON	's ' A Year in
Europe	LOCATION	. '

		As Dr.
Moore	PERSON	went through
Europe	LOCATION	with his eye mainly on its religious sights and aspects , this view-point is prominent in the book , and gives it a certain interest and novelty .

		With him , we visit South - ampton , not for the interest of William the Conqueror or Richard the Lion Hearted , but for the interest of the great hymn-writer Dr.
Watts	PERSON	; we go to
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	, not because of Alfred the Great , but on account of that aggressive churchman
Thomas Ken	PERSON	; we see
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Oxford	LOCATION	, not as great universi - ties , but as great churches ; W ^ estminster
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	appeals to us as the home of the Shorter Cate - chism ; in
Rome	LOCATION	we miss the pagan gloria , but we are edified by a discourse on the relics of the Roman Catholic church .

		Even if we can not agree with Dr.
Moore	PERSON	in all his views and asser - tions , we can find good topics for discussion in his pages .

		For example , when , after noting the l > eauties of the English cathedrals , he says that ' If at the Reformation every cathedral in
Groat Britain	LOCATION	had been pounded to pieces by the iconoclasts , it would have been an immeas - urable calamity to art , but it might have been
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 a real gain to religion ; at any rate , it is ritualism rather than religion that is now pro- moted by the cathedrals / we feel as if the ques - tion is at least an open one .

		Yet we must give the author due credit by adding that in general his statements ' are not heavily marked by uncharitable sectarianism .

		For those who would see
Europe	LOCATION	in its ` dim religious light / the volume wiU be instructive and entertaining .


H. E. COBLENTZ	PERSON	.

		Briefs on
Netv Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of the Historians have long understood courtships of that the unique position of
Eliza	LOCATION	- Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, ^ jgth Tudor as a queen without a consort was a matter of great consequence to her kingdom and to the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	as well ; but not till recently have they fully appreciated the value of the fact as a diplomatic asset .

		Eight years ago , Mr.
Martin Hmne	PERSON	, of the
Public Record Commission	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, published an extended work in which he traced with great minuteness the progress of all the various nego - tiations for the queen 's hand through a period of more than twenty-five years .

		During this period , every marriageable Christian prince seems to have been proposed as a fit consort , only to be more or less speedily rejected .

		The negotiations ceased with the death of Alen § on in
1584	DATE	; * the farce of marriage ' could be played no longer , as there was now no available prince in sight .

		The author views the subject mainly from the diplomatic side ; he is interested chiefly in tracing the effect of these negotiations on the policies and politics of the time .

		It will be readily seen that in forming and dissolving alli - ances the European princes would be strongly influenced by the prospect of winning the hand of the English queen , which prospect was kept continually before their eyes .

		Many were dis - appointed , however , in flnding that the personal side of these projects was not considered in Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's book , and clamored for a more complete treatment .

		The author has yielded to this demand , and has recently published a revised edition of his work tmder its old title , ` The Courtships of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	' -LRB-
McClure	ORGANIZATION	,
Phil	PERSON	- lips
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but with two supplementary chap - ters which carry the narrative on through the queen 's old age to the downfall of Essex in
1601	DATE	.

		In these he discusses her attitude toward her various suitors and later favorites , and attempts to show to what extent she was dominated by the gentler passions .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's picture of Elizabeth the woman is decidedly interesting ; while sensible to the fact that she possessed many qualities of the less lovable order , he does not find her so unwomanly as she is usually thought to be .

		There was much in lier conduct that will always be severely censured ; but on the graver charges against her character , the author , after examining all the existing evidence , delivers a verdict of ` not proven . '

		Theioeather The weather is one of the most as influencing interesting topics of conversation .

		human conduct , if ^ ue may believe the daily evi ^ denee of his ears .

		It has also caused the writ - ing of many books .

		One of the latest of these is entitled ` Weather Influences , ' and comes from the pen of Prof.
Edwin G. Dexter	PERSON	, of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, and the press of Mao - millan .

		In order to arouse the reader 's interest , the author has devoted the first four chapters of his book to weather lore .

		The moon , comets , stars , meteors , and all sorts of meteorological appearances in the sky , are popularly supposed to be available for making prognostications con - cerning the weather .

		Cats , squirrels , opossums , and other animals , are thought to furnish by their actions clues to coming changes of weather .

		Standard literature teems with references to the effects of meteorological conditions upon the emotions and actions of man himself .

		Professor
Dexter	PERSON	, believing that there must be some scien - tific foundation for the apparent modification of man 's conduct by variations of the weather , has made a special study of various data which throw light upon the subject .

		Such were reports of school deportment , and records of the police courts giving accounts of murders , suicides , cases of assault and battery , and of drunk - enness .

		There were also available statistics about deaths , insanity , and disorders of various kinds , including even clerical errors in banks .

		These were obtained largely from the cities of
New York	LOCATION	and
Denver	LOCATION	, the separate occurrences bemg over 600,000 in number .

		They were com - pared with the observations of barometric pres - sure , temperature , humidity , wind-movement , etc. , made at the
U. S. Weather Bureau	ORGANIZATION	stations in those cities .

		Perhaps the most .

		interesting of the conclusions drawn are that the reserve energy capable of being utilized for intellectual pur - poses is affected most by meteorological changes , and that those weather conditions which are espe - cially associated with misconduct are also pro- ductive of health and of mental alertness .

		School - teachers must therefore expect to have their tempers especially tried on those days which are most invigorating .

		The results of Professor
Dex	ORGANIZATION	- ter 's laborious tabulations and comparisons are made plain to the eye by the plotting of curves m the usual fashion .

		We may say in conclusion that the author has made a creditable incursion into a field of research where it is generally quite difficult to draw satisfactory conclusions .

		Chapters on literary men and themes .

		Professor
Thomas Marc Par	PERSON	- rott , of
Princeton	LOCATION	, republishes three of his recent literary essays , adding five new ones , and naming the col - lection ` Studies of a Booklover ' -LRB-
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In his opening chapter , on
Matthew Arn	PERSON	- old , he asserts that ` it is by his poetry that the place of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in English literature will in the end be determined ' ; and then follows an admiring and admirable study of this ` most classic of the Victorian poets . '

		` The
Autobiog	PERSON	- raphy of
Milton	PERSON	' is not the announcement of a newly discovered
Milton	PERSON	manuscript , but an out - line of the poet 's life based on certain autobid - 276 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
Nov.	DATE	i ; graphic fragments scattered through his works .

		The suggestion is offered that a fairly complete biography of Milton might be made by reprinting these fragments in full , and that such a method would perhaps portray the poet more vividly than does Professor
Masson	PERSON	's great work , where
Milton	PERSON	is sometimes lost in a crowd of contem - poraries .

		In ` The Frugal Note of Gray ' the writer discards
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's list of quali - ties constituting a poet 's equipment , and boldly essays to define them anew , -- a harmless amuse - ment in which many before him have indulged .

		In his essay on Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, the author finds the great man 's prose style deficient * in the weightier matters , such as invention , humor , and power of characterization . '

		Ponderosity does indeed belong to
Johnson	PERSON	's humor , which sug - gests the gambols of a megatherium , but hardly to humor at its best .

		* The Charm of
Goldsmith	PERSON	' is well found to reside in his childlikeness .

		` The Vitality of
Browning	PERSON	' is dwelt upon as charac - teristic of the man ; but when it is asserted that * though in the world he was not of it , ' possibly a. murmur of dissent will arise from those who noted in the poet 's lifetime his fondness for smart society .

		Scott , and
Robert Fergusson	PERSON	, the ill-starred poet of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, are the subjects each of an entertaining chapter .

		The appear - ance of the volume , in print , illustrations , and binding , deserves ' a closing word of praise .

		An analysis
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's Autobiography and study of has given a special impetus to
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, ^ ^ y ^ qj .

		writings on the same sub - ject , both biographical and critical .

		Prof.
Josiah Royce	PERSON	uses the work as a convenient basis for an analytical study of
Spencer	PERSON	's contribution to the concept of Evolution .

		As an essay on this dis - tinct subject , including a history of the idea of evolution before
Spencer	PERSON	's time , a review of the origin , development , and limitations of
Spencer	PERSON	's theory , and a statement of the present idea of Evolution , Mr.
Royce	PERSON	's book is illuminating .

		Spencer based his philosophy largely on a self - constructed definition , the faults and incomplete - ness of which Mr.
Royce	PERSON	easily points out , at the same time showing how these faults made pre - cision in
Spencer	LOCATION	's philosophy impossible .

		In a supplementary essay on `
Spencer 's Theories of Education	ORGANIZATION	, ' which , together with a chapter of personal reminiscences by
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's assistant , Mr.
James Collier	PERSON	, complete the vol - ume .

		Mr.
Royce	PERSON	employs the same analytical methods in reference to
Spencer	PERSON	's popular series of essays on Education , with much the same results .

		There is probably no statement in either essay which is not just and accurate ; yet the book has little claim to its sub - title , ` An Esti - mate and a Review . '

		No estimate of
Spencer	PERSON	's work is correct which does not lay stress on the marvellous bridge of organized thought which Spencer built , on the relationships which he ^ tablished between the various sciences , on the inspiration which he has been to a large and influential school of younger men , on all that he did rather than on what he failed to do , on the much in which he was right , rather than on the little in which , thanks largely to his own efforts in stating the problems , we are able to prove him wrong or incomplete .

		We believe that Professor
Royce	PERSON	himself would scarcely call these two slight essays his final estimate of
Herbert Spen	PERSON	- cer 's contribution to the thought of nations .

		-LRB-
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffield & CoO Histories	ORGANIZATION	of the To write the history of
South South American American Republics	ORGANIZATION	is a large Republics .

		undertaking ; and in attempting it for the ` Story of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	' series -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- Mr.
Thomas C. Dawson	PERSON	has wisely devoted two volumes to the subject .

		The first of these , setting forth the history of
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Paraguay	LOCATION	,
Uraguay	LOCATION	, and
Brazil	LOCATION	, the countries upon the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast of the southern continent , received notice in these columns a few months ago .

		For the second volume was reserved an account of the Republics upon the
Gulf	LOCATION	and
Pacific	LOCATION	coasts .

		By far the greater historic interest attaches to these , including what we know as the Conquest of
Peru	LOCATION	, the Spanish colonies and vireinates , the wars for independence of
Spain	LOCATION	out of which emerged
Peru	LOCATION	,
Chile	LOCATION	,
Bolivia	LOCATION	,
Ecuador	LOCATION	,
Venezuela	LOCATION	, and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and the gradual development in these of something like constitutional govern - ment .

		In spite of the difficulties in the way of adequately treating these countries in limited space , we have in this second volimae an admir - able account of them , written more especially in view of the economic relations which will undoubtedly accrue to the
United States	LOCATION	from the building of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal .

		The publica - tion of this second volume was evidently with - held until it could contain an account of the new Republic of
Panama	LOCATION	.

		The chapter devoted to that subject , though brief , is informing .

		The illustrations in the book are interesting , and the three maps with which it is furnished are very valuable .

		Altogether , Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	has brought , in his two volumes , the South American nations within the range of popular historical study .

		The mind and religion of
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		The year has seen an unusual number of
Whittier	LOCATION	biographies and studies , not the least pleas - ing of which is Mr.
Chauneey J. Hawkins	PERSON	's little volume on ` The Mind of
Whittier	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		As the ' title-page announces , and as the author - ship would lead one to expect , -- for Mr.
Haw	PERSON	- kins is a clergyman , -- it is the ` fundamental religious ideas ' of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet that are here treated .

		His ` inner life , ' his optimism , his sympathy with nature and the lessons he draws from her manifold aspects , his belief in the divin - ity of Jesus -LRB- for
Whittier	LOCATION	was no Hicksite -RRB- , his hope of a future life , -- all these subjects are handled as only a true lover and student of Whit - tier 's verse could handle them , with frequent illustrative extracts from the poems .

		The author is inclined to think ` as many religious ideas come from the poets as from ' the Bible ' ; and no one who has a spark of poetry in his soul , and who bears in mind how much of the
Bible	ORGANIZATION	is itself poetry , will dispute him .

		We ` are reminded , and comforted by the remembrance , that with all
Whittier	LOCATION	's trust in the Eternal Goodness he
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 277 was by no means unharassed by doubt or unper - plexed by difficult problems , ` the same old baf - fling questions , ' which he made no pretense of answering .

		That he is to-day the poet most fre - quently quoted in our pulpits , and that his appeal to the religious instincts is far stronger than that of
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, or
Bryant	PERSON	, is an assertion few will contest .

		Mr.
Hawkins	PERSON	's appre - ciative study of the dominant element in Whit - tier 's verse will send Whittier-lovers back to their poet with renewed zest .

		A misprint that maj ^ perplex some is found in Mrs.
Claflin	PERSON	's name , which appears as ' Chaflin , ' and in Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's , which masquerades as `
Steadman	PERSON	. '

		Indian life .

		Under the same editorial auspices in town and as that of ' Our European Neigh - in country .

		bors ' series , and having the same publishers -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a series of ` Our
Asiatic Neighbors	ORGANIZATION	' now begins , its initial volume being ` Indian Life in Town and Country , ' by Mr.
Her	PERSON	- bert
Compton	PERSON	, whose intimate acquaintance with
India	LOCATION	extends back for thirty years .

		The first part of his work treats of ` Native Indian Life , ' in which the reader is told some most surprising things about the divergences of race , religion , and language , in
India	LOCATION	, -- divergences greater than in any portion of
Europe	LOCATION	; about what is meant by the term ` caste , ' and what a powerful social influence is exerted thereby ; about the condition of Avoman under the Indian social sys - tem ; and about the new epoch in Indian affaii-s ushered in by the opening of the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the subject of his later division , `
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Indian Life , ' we might claim to have some pre - vious knowledge through Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's tales ; but Mr.
Compton	PERSON	's chapters on ` Bungalow Life ' and kindred topics will certainly aid to a better understanding and deeper appreciation of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's ` Plain Tales from the Hills . '

		The book contains a wealth of information set forth in pleasing style , and verifies the statement quoted from De Tocqueville , ` There has never been any - thing so wonderful under the sun as the con - quest , and , still more , the government , of
India	LOCATION	by the British . '

		Text-books are not inspiring subjects for a reviewer .

		It is difficult to explain briefly the point of view or the manner of presentation of an author who addresses himself primarily to students .

		Particularly in psychology , in which topic scholars on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	have contributed so many and such distinctive texts , is it difficult to characterize the status of another competitor for favor .

		Professor
Murray	PERSON	of Mon - treal has re-written his former text-book of Psychology and made a larger and more readable volume of it -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book belongs to the class of psychologies that depend upon description as the chief method of pres - entation .

		It covers the conventional ground , dividing the subject material into topics belong - ing to general psychology and those belonging to special psychology .

		In both portions clearness and readability are prominent , and an effort to carry the interest of the student is maintained .

		It can not be said that the result presents any An introduction to Psychology .

		unusual features ; but Professor
Murray	PERSON	's book will find favor among '' those who sjnupathize with his methods of presentation .

		This verdict must not be understood as condemning the volume with faint praise , but , on the contrary , as an expres - sion of admiration for the success with which a well-planned scheme of presentation has been carried out .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`

Mary Elizabeth Carter	PERSON	, is a practical book on home management published by

		HENRY VAN DYKE has produced a mature volume of serious poetry -- - a distinct advance in tech - nical skill over his former volumes and wider in its sympathies and finer in its imagination .

		He is one of the very few men in this country who are writing poetry of distinction in form and profound in its in - spiration .

		He confirms his position as a leader among American poets by the Odes to `` Music '' and `` God oftheOpen Air , '' by the sonnet `` Patria , '' and by the lyrics `` Light Between the Trees '' and `` A Mile with Me . ''

		These are poetry of a high rank , and moreover are inspiring to the reader .

		BRIEFER MENTION 318 NOTES 318 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 319 LITERATURE IN SCHOOL .

		The idea of literature considered as a subject for school instruction is not unsuggestive of the late Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	's popular verses on '
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	in Pound . '

		The case of the winged steed made captive and forced for a time to consort with the vulgar equine herd has a like quality of pathos with the case of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's or
Milton	PERSON	's soaring imagination brought down to earth and made to jostle roughly with the crude thoughts of childish minds .

		Theoretically , those minds may be taught to soar by this enforced communion ; practically , they are apt to view with contempt the example offered them , and continue to grovel or to grope as before .

		Some of them , it is safe to say , will continue to grovel after the stage of childhood is past .

		They may become excellent blacksmiths or drummers or politicians , but their imagina - tions will never learn to soar , and the daily newspaper -LRB- with pictures -RRB- will be the only sort of reading that will ever really interest them .

		The grovellers are by nature impervious to literature , and they may frankly be aban - doned as hopeless .

		It is different with the gropers .

		They , at least , offer possibilities ; but if these are to be encouraged and developed , it must be gradually and by persuasion , not sud - denly and by categorical imperative .

		Too fierce a flood of light , too determined a guidance , are dangers rather than helps to the groping spirit .

		Those of us who have been watching rather closely the developments of the past twenty years in the school teaching of English litera - ture do not feel altogether encouraged by what has been accomplished .

		The expenditure of breath and ink upon the subject has been prodigious ; the results are so slight as to indi - cate that most of this energy has been misdi - rected .

		We have devices and methods and scientifically-planned courses without number , of a kind never dreamed of in the old days , but they do not seem to give our boys and girls a finer appreciation of literature , or a deeper love for good reading , than was achieved with - out making any particular fuss about it a gen - eration ago .

		It is evident that something is wrong , and it is deeply important for us to find out just where the fault lies , as a necessary pre - liminary for the suggestion of remedies .

		In a general way , we feel safe in asserting that the root of the failure to produce results in the teaching of English literature commen - 294 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, surate with our efforts is to be found in the fact that we deal with the subject too much as we deal with other subjeots , not recognizing the differences which set it fundamentally apart from linguistics and history and science .

		We make it a matter of cram and pedantic detail , of examination and essay-writing , practices which are almost certain to defeat the inculca - tion of literary taste , although such inculcation must surely be the primary aim of the work .

		Above all , we administer prescribed texts and courses of reading , and tamely submit to the abominable system of specific tasks invented by the colleges to save themselves the trouble of making a real investigation of the literary qual - ifications of those who apply at their doors for admission .

		Three years ago President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	, speaking upon this subject before the
New England Association of Colleges and Second	ORGANIZATION	- ary Schools , denounced our present methods in the following vigorous language : ' I doubt if among all the recent triumphs of the uniformitarians any has been worse than marking off a definite quantum in this great field , or more violence done to both the subject and the youthful mind .

		The wide acceptance of these requirement books and authors marks , I believe , a pedagogic decadence , which in a future far nearer than we dream of will be pointed out as the low-water mark of English teaching which the last century can show , and as one of the most disastrous triumphs of mechanism and convenience over mental needs . '

		This language is not , in our opinion , any too scathing , but we fear that the future toward which it so confidently looks will not prove to be one ` far nearer than we dream of . '

		Before we can secure the needed reform , we must over - come an inertia which it is difficult to overesti - mate ; we must effect a general substitution of vital methods , which are difficult , for mechan - ical methods , which are easy , in the work of our teachers of English literature high and low .

		The single word ` flexibility ' is the word which better than any other expresses the rational ideal of instruction in this all-impor - tant subject .

		The changes are rung upon this word , and upon the need which it fits , by Pro- fessor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, in a recent paper so admir - ahly conceived that it deserves the widest possible reading .

		Originally prepared as a lec - ture at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, it is now printed in the
October	DATE	issue of ' The Sewanee Keview . '

		The charge usually brought by the partisans of pedantry and mechanism against the literary teaching of literature is that it encourages ' chatter about
Harriet	PERSON	, ' and unreg - ulated emotional expression , and all the vapor - ings of dilettanteism .

		But this charge does not lie against an advocate who , like the one now in question , has already given to scholar - ship the most substantial of hostages , and whose precepts are the outcome of many years of professional practice .

		What such a man says carries weight , even if one dissents from it ; for our own part , we agree most heartily with premises and conclusions alike .

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	, like the subject of * In Memo - riam , ' has ' faced the spectres of the mind , ' but he has not laid them .

		He says : * I even venture to question whether the average boy or girl goes to college with much more knowl - edge and love of literature than was the case before they were drilled and examined in the redoubtable `` English Classics '' ... What I doubt is whether the generation now entering college , after a course of literature in the schools , is much better off , so far as a love and knowledge of literature are concerned , than my own generation was with practically no training in the subject . '

		And the reasons for this failure he sees clearly enough .

		They are exemplified in the histories of English literature , in the kind of notes pro- vided with the texts studied ^ in the misuse of the written examination , and in the vicious practice of writing essays , which are likely to be bricks without straw , except of the baled variety afforded by the encyclopaedias .

		Here are some apposite quotations upon each of the above four points , expressing the results of the writer 's experience as a teacher : ` But my new treatment of my younger students led to some important results .

		Beading so much to them myself and giving them so much outside reading to do left no time for the study of a formal manual of literary history .

		... I finally required the reading of
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's excellent `` Primer of English Literature , '' but did not examine on it .

		I knew well enough that I was mak - ing a sacrifice on the side of exact knowledge , but it seemed to me it had to be made . '

		` The teacher ... must be prepared to make other sacrifices .

		If the annotated texts furnished him do not produce the best results , he must eschew their use .

		Personally I have found such texts occasionally valuable , but I prefer
Palgrave	PERSON	s `` Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics '' to any annotated text I ever used . '

		` Do we not sacrifice the spirit of literature while we are examining on the letter , or rather training our poor children so that they may stand some other person 's examination on the letter ?

		As the dread day comes around , do teachers find them - selves and their classes reading with rapt interest the noble speeches of
Portia	LOCATION	, or are they busy with the date of the play , with some critic 's opin - ion with regard to
Portia	LOCATION	's womanliness , with the names and dates of actual women lawyers and law teachers in
Italy	LOCATION	, with the sources of the caskets incident , and similar matters only too dear to examiners ? '

		.

		i. * ` For the school or college essay used as atest ot literary work rather than as a test of work in Eng - lish composition I must confess I have very little respect .

		I fear that it encourages smattering , that it stimulates juvenile conceit , that it tends to crys - tallize tastes and opinions at an age when every effort should be made to widen and lend flexibility to the mind , that it leads to unconscious plagiarism and to a complacent habit of airing one 's common - placeness and fatuity . '

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 296 Mr.
Trent	PERSON	calls these opinions heresies , and doubtless they will seenii so to many pedagogues .

		But the time will come when they shall be regarded as the merest commonplaces of self - evident truth , and not until that time does come will we have cause for self-gratulation on the subject of the teaching of literature .

		Our own conclusion is so exactly that of the writer that we can not do better than state it in the words which he uses as a spokesman of the class of teachers to which he belongs .

		Address - ing his fellow-teachers of other subjects , he says : ` We can , if we please , make our examinations as rigid as you do yours , but we do not believe that our facts are as important as yours , or at any rate can be acquired with so much advantage to our pupils .

		We wish to grade and advance our pupils on more flexible lines than you adopt , because we believe that the nature of our subject makes such flexible lines advisable .

		We believe that both the subject we teach and the subjects you teach are necessary to a catholic education ; but that , while we are contributing to the same end as you , our means must be different from yours . '

		And the upshot of the matter is that our work ' resolves itself into little more than securing a wide amount of reading from children during their school years ... Let us have fewer new bad essays written and more good old books read . '

		ROMANCE AND REALISM .

		Although fiction deals with the lives and characters of imaginary people , it is at its best no less true than history and biography , which set forth the actual facts of life .

		The trui ^ i of fiction is indioated by its constant popularity in all ages among all races .

		* You ca n't fool all the people all the time , ' and if the drama and the epic and novel were not true , men would pass them by as they put away childish things .

		There is a distinction between fact and truth , between actuality and reality .

		A fact is a spe - cific manifestation of a general law : this gen - eral law is the truth that causes and explains the fact .

		It is a fact that when an apple-tree is shaken in the breeze , the apples that are loosened from the twigs fall to the ground ; it is a truth that bodies in space attract each other with a force varying inversely as the square of the distance between them .

		The universe as we feel it with our senses is actulal : the laws of the universe as we discover them by our under - standing are real .

		All human investigation , whether scientific or artistic , is an endeavor to arrive at the truth which underlies the facts that we perceive ; it is an effort to understand the large reality of which the actuial is but a sensuously percepti - ble embodiment .

		Both the scientist and the artist begin their work by collecting a large number of related facts and arranging them in an intelligent manner ; and then proceed to induce from the observation of them an appre - hension of the general law thiat explains their relation .

		This hypothesis is then tested in the light of further experience , until it seems so incontestible that men 's minds accept it as the truth .

		Art and SK3ience do not differ in their method of arriving at the truth ; they diverge merely in their means of expressing it after it has been apprehended .

		The scientist formulates it in a theoretic statement , while the artist gives it an imaginative embodiment perceptible to the senses .

		The purpose of fiction is to embody the truth of human life in a series of relations between imaginary characters .

		The writer of fiction , when he does his work well , first observes care - fully the facts of life , studies them in the light of extended experience , and induces from them certain general laws which he deems to be the truths which underlie them .

		He then creates imaginatively such characters and scenes as will illustrate the truths he has discovered and con - vey them clearly to the minds of his readers .

		His work must be as earnest and rigorous as that of the natural scientist ; and it is there - fore not strange that most great novelists should ripen late .

		If the general laws of life which the novelist has thought out be true laws , and if his imag - inary embodiment of them be thoroughly consistent , his characters will be true men and women in the highest sense .

		They will not be actual , but they will be real .

		The great characters of fiction , -- Sir
Willoughby Patteme	PERSON	,
Tito Melema	PERSON	, D ` Artagnan ,
Pere Grandet	PERSON	,
Eosalind	LOCATION	,
Tartuffe	LOCATION	, Hamlet ,
Ulysses	PERSON	, -- embody truths of life that have been arrived at only after long observation of facts and patient induction from them .

		Cervantes must have observed many , many dreamers before he learned the truth of the idealist 's character which he has expressed in
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		The great people of fiction are typical of large classes of mankind .

		They live more truly than do you and I , because they are made of us and of many men beside .

		They have the large reality of general ideas , which is a truer thing than the actuality of facts .

		This is why we know them and think of them as real people , -- old acquaintances whom we knew before we were born , when we lived with them in
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's realm of ideas .

		In
France	LOCATION	, instead of calling a man a miser , they speak of him as : an
Harpagon	LOCATION	.

		We know
Rosalind	PERSON	as we know our latest sum - mer love ; Hamlet is our elder brother , and understands our own wavering and faltering .

		The characters in the noblest fiction are so real and true that even their creator has no power 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, to make them do what they will not .

		Shake - speare tells us that
Oliver	PERSON	suddenly clmnged his nature and won the love of
Celia	LOCATION	; but we know that in this case
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	lies .

		The scene is not true to the truth of fiction .


Colonei Newcome	PERSON	is a dear old soul , and we do not want him to be made miserable ; but if
Thack	LOCATION	- eray had told us that the good man lived hap - pily until his death , surrounded by the people that he knew ,
Thackeray	PERSON	would have lied .

		The author had to tell the bitter truth , though it cost him many tears .

		Arbitrary plotting is of no avail in fiction : Tom and
Maggie Ttilliver	PERSON	were not really drowned in a flood .

		We know when a story is true and when it is not .

		The aim , then , of all writers of fiction who take their work seriously and do it honestly , is to body forth the truth of life in a series of imagined facts .

		But there are two different ways of doing this -- two distinct micthods of setting forth the truth ; and hence we find two schools of novelists , which we distinguish by the titles Eealistic and
Eomantic	ORGANIZATION	.

		The distinction between Eealism and Rom - ance is fundamental and wide-reaching ; for every man , whether consciously or not , is either a realist or a romanticist .

		The reader who is a realist by nature will prefer
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	to
Scott	LOCATION	; the reader who is romantic will rather read Victor Hugo than
Balzac	LOCATION	; and neither taste is better than the other .

		Each is born in the blood , and has its origin deep in the gen - eral heart of man .

		In view of this fact , it seems strange that no adequate definition has over been made of the difference between Eeal - ism and
Eomance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Various superficial explan - ations have been offered , it is true ; but none of these has been scientific and satisfactory .

		We have been told , for instance , that the roman - ticists dwell chiefly upon action , while the real - ists are interested mainly in drawing character .

		But this explanation is obviously wrong , for we have great romantic characters like
Eomeo	PERSON	, and great realistic scenes like
Eawdon Crawley	PERSON	's discovery of his wife with
Lord Steyne	LOCATION	.

		We have been told also that the realists paint the manners of their own place and time , while the romanticists deal with more unusual material ; but
Stevenson	PERSON	's highly romantic ' ` New Arabian Nights ' depicts details of
London	LOCATION	` and Parisian life in our own day , and the realistic ` Bomola ' carries us back through many centuries to a medifeval city far away .

		For the true distinction between
Eealism	ORGANIZATION	and
Eomance	ORGANIZATION	, we must revert to our analogy between the work of the writer of fiction and that of the natural scientist .

		If we consider the matter carefully , we shall see that the dif - ference is merely this : In setting forth his view of life , the realist follows the inductive method of presentment , while the romanticist follows the deductive method .

		The distinction between inductive and deductive processes of thought is very simple and is known to all .

		When we think inductively , we reason from the particular to the general ; and when we think deductively , we reverse the process and reason from the general to the particular .

		In our ordinary conversation , we speak inductively when we first mention a number of simple facts and then draw from them some general infer - ence ; and we speak deductively when we first express a general opinion and then illustrate it by adducing siDccific illustrations .

		Now it is just in this way that Eealism differs from
Eomance	LOCATION	.

		Both the realist and the romanticist aim to set forth a true view of life ; but in ; doing so , as I have said , the realist works inductively and the romanticist deductively .

		In order to bring to our knowledge the law of life which he wishes to make clear , the realist first leads us through a series of imagined facts as similar as possible to the details of actual life which he was obliged to study in order to arrive at his general conception .

		He elabo - rately imitates the facts of life , so that he may say to us finally , ' This is what I saw in the world , and from this I learned the truth I have to tell you . '

		He leads us step by step from the particular to the general , until at last we not only know the truth he has to express but are also familiar with the very processes of thought by which he arrived at this truth . '


Adam Bede	PERSON	' tells us not only what
George Eliot	PERSON	knew about life , but also how she came to learn it .

		But the romantic novelist works differently .

		He does not try to show us how he arrived at his general conception .

		His only care is to bring his general idea home to us by giving it a specific illustrative embodiment .

		He feels no obligation to make the imagined facts of his story resemble closely the actual details of life ; he is anxious only that they shall represent his idea adequately and consistently .


Stevenson	PERSON	knew that man has a dual nature , and that the evil in him , when pampered , will gradually gain the upper hand over the good .

		He did not attempt to set forth this truth inductively , showing us the kind of facts from the observa - tion of which he had drawn his conclusion .

		He merely gave his thought an illustrative embodiment , conceiving a dual charajcter in which a man 's uglier self should have a separate incarnation .

		He constructed his tale deduct - ively : beginning with a general conception , he reduced it to particular terms . '

		Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	' is a thoroughly true story , even though its incidents are contrary to the actual facts of life .

		It is just as real as a realistic novel ; and in order to make it so , its author , because he was working deductively , was not
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 obliged to imitate the facts he had observed . '

		I have learned something in the world / he says to us ; * here is a fable that will make it clear to you . '

		We see immediately that each of these two methods of presentment is natural and true ; and hence all criticism that aims to exalt Romance above Realism , or Realism above Romance , must be forever futile .

		The minds of men have always moved in two channels , and always will .

		We have both inductive ` and deductive sciences , -- we even have inductive and deductive systems of morality ; and as long as men shall write , we shall have , and ought to have , both inductive and deductive fiction .

		Neither of these two methods of writing fi ^ c - tion -- • the realistic and the romantic -- is truer than the other ; and both are great when they are well employed .

		Each , however , lends itself to certain abuges which it will be well for us to notice briefly .

		In his careful imitation of actual life , the realist may grow near-sighted and come to value facts for their own sake , forgetting that his primary purpose in setting them forth should be to lead us to understand the truths which underlie them .

		From this misconception arise the tedious minuteness of
George Eliot	PERSON	, the interminable tea-cups of
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	, and the mire of the imita - tors of Zola .

		The romanticist , on the other hand , because he works with greater freedom , may o'erleap himself and express in a loose fashion general conceptions which are hasty and devoid of truth .

		To this defect is owing the vast deal of rubbish which has been foisted on us recently by feeble imitators of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	.

		The realists gain nothing by hooting at the abuses of Romance ; and the romanticists gain as little by yawning over Realism at its worst .

		The Scylla and the Charybdis of fiction-writing may both be avoided ; and at their best , the realist work - ing inductively , and the romanticist working deductively , are equally able to arrive at the truth of fiction .

		` THE SOCIALIZATION OF HUMANITY . '

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		May I ask for a little space in your journal iu which to reply to some strictures on my book , ` The Socialization of Humanity , ' reviewed in your issue of
October 16	DATE	?

		In the first place , your reviewer says that * There are many quota - tions from
Comte	ORGANIZATION	' in my book ; whereas in fact there is nojt even one .

		Your reviewer would lead a person to think I am a Positivist , a dis - ciple of Comte ; whereas I am no more a disciple of Comte than of Spencer or
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, or of any other philosopher who has profoundly influenced the thought of the race .

		He says I did not heed
Spencer	PERSON	's criticism of Comte ; whereas I did heed it , and cited it as an example of the familiar fact that even the greatest of philosophers are often unjust in criticising one another .

		He says , further , * We have a mislead - ing reference to Kant -LRB- p. 90 -RRB- ; his destructive criticism of theology is mentioned , but nothing is said of his constructive argument . '

		Yet on page 344 of my book I do refer to his construc - tive argiunent , showing that it was based on sentiment , not on facts and reason .

		Your reviewer quotes an invective sentence criticizing the successful teacher in our modern universities ; but he heads his remark with , ` This is the author 's idea of a university , ' which is absurdly false .

		Throughout the book , time and again , I say that the function of the school is to adjust man to his environment , natural and social , and that in the future it will be the great - est institution of the race , and the teacher the greatest of men .

		He ends his criticism by saying of my invective sentence , ' One must feel relieved after expelling that kind of matter from his consciousness ! '

		Had I reviewed a book as he reviewed mine , I am sure I would have a load on my conscience , even if the review was actuated by feeling aroused from criticism of my pro- fession or opposition to my beliefs .

		One of the books noticed in connection with mine was ` The Laws of Imitation , ' by
Gabriel Tarde	PERSON	.

		Your reviewer points out the imperfec - tion of Tarde 's concept , saying , ` Imitation is a fact which explains many facts , but it itself is a phenomenon to be explained . '

		Yet he failed to see that in Chapter II .

		of my book this difficulty is overcome in my concept of the Law of Repeti - tion , in which I show that there are two forms of this law , internal and external , and that imita - tion is but a form of the Law of External Repeti - tion .

		The sub-title of my book , ` An Analysis and Synthesis of the
Phenomena of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, Life , Mind , and Society , through the Law of Repeti - tion , ' should have caused him to compare the two books , for both attempt to explain the various phenomena of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	through different concep - tions of the same great law .

		Your reviewer remarks that ` Those who have felt the rational difficulties of this crude form of monism may regard it as final ' ; and then suggests that those who have studied
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	,
Kant	PERSON	,
Green	ORGANIZATION	,
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	, and Tiele , will conclude ` that there are problems of philosophy that this writer has not even had a glimpse of . '

		Perhaps so .

		But would a philosopher send a pupil to
Kant	PERSON	or
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	to-day expecting him to find a solution of the Riddle of the Universe ?

		Spencer says of Kant : ' I commenced reading a copy of
Kant	PERSON	's '' Critique of Pure Reason , '' but did not go far .

		The doctrine that Time a '' d Space are '' nothing but subjective forms , -- pertain exclu - sively to consciousness , and have nothing beyond consciousness answering to them , '' -- I rejected at once and absolutely .

		Tacitly , giving an author credit for consistency , I take it for granted that if his fundamental principles are wrong the rest can not be right ' -LRB- Autobiography , Vol .

		I. , p. 289 -RRB- .

		298 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	says of Hegel : ' But the height of audacity in serving up pure nonsense , in string - ing together senseless and extravagant mazes of words , such as had previously been heard only in mad-houses , was finally reached in
Hegel	LOCATION	, and became the instrument of the most barefaced mystification that has ever taken place , with a result which will appear fabulous to posterity and will ever remain as a monument of German stupidity . '

		-LRB- ` The World as Will and Idea , ' Vol .

		n. , p. 22 . -RRB-

		After this , one would think there would be an end to citing
Kant	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	as authorities with which to eclipse present-day philosophers .

		Knowing the fairness of The Dial I submit my protest to this review .

		No one could pos - sibly gather from it anything as to the real nature of my book .

Kendall Franklin	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	,
Nov. 10 , 1904	DATE	.

		-LSB- The authoor 's retort is natural , and , from his standpoint , just .

		Certainly he has a right to a hearing .

		It may be more exact to say tliat he uses
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's ideas without giving him credit by name ; and if he prefers this phras - ing to ' quotation , ' he is welcome to use it .

		His reference to page 344 , w ^ here
Kant	PERSON	is said to have rejected a belief in God , must further illustrate his misrepresentation of that author .

		The charge made against actual universities whatever might happen in the author 's imag - inary institutions , the reviewer still believes to be gross caricature .

		Each reader must judge for himself whether the author has improved on Tarde ; the reviewer finds nothing of value in the additions .

		In spite of the formidable quo - tation from Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	, weighted with the author 's own judgment , the idealists will prob - ably continue to hold a place in the scholar 's world .

		The Advance of the
West	LOCATION	.

		* The publication of a series of reprints of ' Early Western Travels ' in thirty-one volumes , contemporaneously with the appearance of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	journals in their first com - plete form , and so soon after the monumental edition of the ' Jesuit Relations , ' is a sign of the interest that is aroused in
Western	LOCATION	history and an indication that the region on this side of the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	mountains has reached the stage that comes to every people when , in the pride of achievement , it turns to survey the records of its past .

		Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	, the editor of all these series , has done a service to his - torical scholarship in bringing out these impor - tant sources of Western history .

		It is a wonderful panorama that these ' Early Western Travels ' reveal .

		The ' Jesuit Rela - tions ' had exhibited the French exploration of the vast interior as told by religious enthusiasts wandering in the forests of the Great Lakes , pushing their canoes along the labyrinth of water-courses that thread the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, and describing the savage life in this wild new world before the coming of the farmer and the artisan .

		1904 -RSB- THE DIAL 2d9 in the forests of
Canada	LOCATION	and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, in the days of the Eevolution .

		We are shown the begin - nings of town-life on the
Ohio	LOCATION	, in
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and on the uplands of the
Caro	PERSON	- linas , in the closing years of the eighteenth and the first of the nineteenth century .

		Later travellers in the period preceding and following the War of
1812	DATE	describe for us the farms , the inns , the life on the highways along the road blazed by the soldiers of the French and Indian war , and show us communities , still rude and in the gristle , but buoyant with young life and vigor , springing up where the log-cabin and the backwoodsman 's clearing had made a begin - ning , or on the sites recently occupied by trad - ers ' stations or by army posts on the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		They carry us down the current of the Mis - sissippi , and give us views of the plantations on its lower reaches , of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and of the returning boatmen making the dangerous over - lajid journey by the
Natchez	LOCATION	trace , or going by sea to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to complete by land the circuit to the head of the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		In the later volumes , pathfinders for the advance into the wider West stretching across the
Great Plains	LOCATION	and the
Eocky Mountains	LOCATION	to the waters of the
Pacific	LOCATION	tell of their adventures and picture the savages and the country .

		As traveller after traveller in successive periods passes over the routes of his predecessor , reporting the life by the wayside and in the towns , we can almost see American society unfolding with startling rapidity under our gaze ; farms become ham - lets , hamlets grow into cities ; the Indian and the forest recede ; new stretches of wilderness , unoccupied empires , come into view in the farther West , and we see the irresistible tide of settlement flowing toward the solitudes .

		In spite of all the petty detail of personal elements , and the daily itinerary , these volumes are intensely interesting ; for we have not many dry pages to turn before we come upon some realistic Indian speech exhibiting forebodings of their coming doom , some graphic descrip - tion of Indian life or traders ' perils , some pen - picture of a city now populous and powerful in the commerce of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but then in its rude infancy .

		But the volumes are more than enter - taining .

		For the critical reader , they constitute a mine of material on the economic and social development of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Making due allow - ance for the mistakes of the travellers , we may learn much from them of such topics as the land-values of the successive areas of settle - ment , and may better comprehend the forces at work to attract the pioneers to the cheap lands that bordered the region of towns and clearings .

		We have accounts of pioneer agriculture ; of the modes of clearing the land ; of the shipments of the surplus of flour down the
Ohio	LOCATION	and the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, to serve the planters of the South or to go on to the
West Indies	LOCATION	; and of the droves of cattle and hogs going to
Baltimore	LOCATION	or
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		Tables of prices of provisions and the rate of wages in Western communities show the exceeding cheapness of some commodities and the dearness of others , and the opportu - nities that the West afforded to the workman to secure a surplus with which to purchase lands of his own .

		The beginnings of cotton cultiva - tion in the up-country of the South , along the alluvial lands of the lower
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and in
central Tennessee	LOCATION	, are noted , and the depend - ence of the staple areas upon the provisions of the upper
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		We are also given pictures of the social life of the
West	LOCATION	- erners ; the contrasts between the Southern and
New England	LOCATION	elements are drawn , and the beginnings of an interest in music and the drama are indicated as occasional exceptions in the general indifference to such elements of social development .

		Of course , the accounts of these travellers are to be taken with many grains of allowance .

		America bitterly resented the tone of most of the English visitors , and denied the correctness of their portraiture of our manners and condi - tions .

		The ` War of the Eeviews , ' from
1819	DATE	to
1824	DATE	, which
McMaster	PERSON	has epitomised in the fourth volume of his ' History of the American People , ' shows how the English periodicals pointed their criticisms against American civil - ization on the basis of the accounts of Eliglish travellers , and how hotly their criticism was resented by the sensitive American public .

		The traveller is always prone to be impressed by the exceptional rather than by the typical ; the English travellers of that day particularly had their own customs and prejudices , and for the most part they did not remain long enough to acquire full comprehension of the conditions .

		But the present series combines American with English and French travels , and the volumes so far issued are sympathetic rather than cap - tious .

		The principle of selection applied by Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	is a compromise between the desire of the publishers , on the one side , that only rare boofe should be selected , and the natural incli - nation of the editor to choose those of greatest historical value .

		The volumes dealing with the region east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	in the period from
1800	DATE	to
1835	DATE	, for example , are selected from a possible list of at least a hundred , many of them quite as worthy as those included , some more valuable .

		But some of the best of these are still in the market , so that we may be thank - ful for the policy that has given renewed life to those that were disappearing .

		Works in Eng - lish , French , German , Italian , and Spanish exist for this period , which seems to have attracted an unusual number of travellers .

		300 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Only brief characterizations can here be given to the separate volumes that treat of the coun - try east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, leaving for future review the travels of
Bradbury	ORGANIZATION	,
Brackenridge	LOCATION	,
Franchere	LOCATION	, and
Ross	PERSON	, which extended to tibe
Missouri	LOCATION	and
Oregon	LOCATION	countries .

		The first volume of the series is made up of typical early journeys into the Indian countr -RCB- ' in the middle of the eighteenth century , when the
Ohio	LOCATION	wilderness was the region of Indian fighting and the bone of contention between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.


Conrad Weiser	PERSON	's journal of a tour to the
Ohio	LOCATION	in
1748	DATE	, as agent of the colony of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, tells of his mission to bring presents to the Indians . '

		Bretheren , ' said he to the
Ohio	LOCATION	savages , ' some of you have been in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	last Fall & acquainted us that You had taken up the English Hatchet , and that you had already made use of it against the French , & that the French had very hard heads & your Country afforded nothing but Sticks & Hickerys which was not sufficient to break them . '

		The peace of
1748	DATE	intervening , the English had changed the succor thus demanded to a friendly present , with the inti - mation that the French would soon be at war again with the English .

		Nothing could more clearly reveal the hollowness of the treaty and the certainty of hostilities on the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The editorial introduction to this volume gives only an inadequate presentation of the career of
Conrad Weiser	PERSON	, whose life exhibits the impor - ^ tance of the German element in the interior of
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	; no reference is made to the recent biographies of
Weiser	PERSON	.

		The Irish element on the frontier is repre - sented by selections from the writings of
George Croghan	PERSON	, illustrating , -LRB- 1 -RRB- the period of Eng - lish ascendancy on the
Ohio	LOCATION	, by three docu - ments of
1750	DATE	and
1751	DATE	; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the period of French ascendancy , hostility toward the Eng - lish , and war on the frontiers , by four docu - ments of 1754-1757 ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the period of the close of the war , the surrender of the French forts , and the renewed hostility of the Indians , by two journals .

		Croghan 's work as fur-trader and Indian agent for
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and after - wards for
New York	LOCATION	, was very important .

		It is interesting to notice the careful attention to soils and other conditions for fufture settlement shown in his journals .

		The account of his jour - ney of
1765	DATE	, which was an important source for
Parkman	PERSON	in his ' Conspiracy of
Pontiac	LOCATION	, ' is a combined version made by the present editor from two supplementary versions , one the offi - cial report -LRB-
New York Colonial Documents	ORGANIZATION	, VII .

		779-788 -RRB- , and the other the private jour - nal published by Featherstonehaugh and after - ward by
Mann Butler	PERSON	in his ' History of
Ken	PERSON	- tucky . '

		For the `` Western conditions in this period of transition of the
Ohio Valley	ORGANIZATION	from French to English control , the writings of Croghan are of much value .

		The list of Indian tribes in the
Northern district	LOCATION	, with the location and numbers of warriors , is a valuable document for the student of the
American Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		Post 's journals give us his two journeys to the
Ohio	LOCATION	; one in
1758	DATE	to the neighborhood of
Fort Duquesne	LOCATION	, and the other in 1758-59 to win the Indians to support the advance of
General Forbes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Post was a Moravian missionary , and his career illustrates the way in which the English authorities made use of these German apostles of peace to conciliate the Indians .

		The courage and devotion of this missionary clearly appear in his journey into the hostile region of the forks of the
Ohio	LOCATION	still possessed by the French .

		We get from his journals the impres - sion -LRB- due perhaps to his own views in paxt -RRB- that the Indians were reluctantly drawn into the conflict between the French and the Eng - lish . '

		Why do not you and the French fight in the old country , and on the sea ?

		Why do you come to fight on our land ?

		This makes every - body believe you want to take the land from us by force and settle it . '

		Captain
Morris	PERSON	's journal is of a different type .

		It is by an English officer , with a light - ness of literary touch and an equal lightness of mind , ' a fashionable dilettante ' who was rather out of place in the midst of the hostile condi - tions of
Detroit	LOCATION	and the
Maumee	LOCATION	in
1764	DATE	.

		His account of his escapes from torture and his flight to
Detroit	LOCATION	is interesting , as is his inter - view with
Pontiac	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 305 , 307 -RRB- .

		The second volume is given to the travels of
John Long	PERSON	, an English Indian-trader who came to
North America	LOCATION	in
1768	DATE	and passed nearly twenty years among the Indians of the upper
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, the
Nipigon	ORGANIZATION	district north and northeast of Lake Superior , and in the
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	region .

		The work is of value in its description of the intercourse of traders and savages , in the period of the free trader , before the great fur companies were formed ; in its accounts of the Indians ; and in its narrative of the expedition of Canadians and
Indiansfrom Mackinac to Prairie du Chien	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, in
1780	DATE	, to secure the furs of that place from capture by the forces of
George Rogers Clark	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book appeared in
London	LOCATION	in
1791	DATE	, when the question of the evacuation of the North - western posts was under consideration by Eng - land ; and Long 's opinion that the retention of the posts was essential to
England	LOCATION	's maintain - ing an effective barrier for
Canada	LOCATION	, doubtless influenced public opinion .

		The appendix to this volume contains a vocabulary of the Chip - peway language .

		The conservatism of the editor is shown by his note to Long 's assertion
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 that ` the Menominee Indians kill their wives and children before they go to battle / Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	comments that ' No mention of such a barbarous custom as this is made by other writers .

		Long may have been misinformed . '

		Let us hope so !

		In the third volume we have the travels of the Michauxs , father and son .


Andre Michaux	PERSON	's journal is of interest not only as a view of
Kentucky	LOCATION	conditions in
1793	DATE	, and of the west - ern waters in
1795-96	DATE	, but also from the fact that the journey was something more than the tour of a botanist .


Michaux	PERSON	was the agent of Genet to concert with
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	an attack by the frontiersmen upon
New Orleans	LOCATION	in the interest of
France	LOCATION	.

		It is only side-lights that we get , however , upon his important inter - views with
Kentucky	LOCATION	leaders .

		The later jour - ney of
1795	DATE	and
1796	DATE	no doubt had also a rela - tion to the revised plans of
France	LOCATION	for the recovery of
Louisiana	LOCATION	in those years .

		As a botanist of well-established reputation ,
Michaux	PERSON	could travel in these regions without especial suspicion ; and his journal gives ample evi - dence that his heart was in his botani - cal investigation .

		Jefferson had favored him as the leader of a trans-continental exploration by way of the
Missouri	LOCATION	in
1793	DATE	-LRB- not
1794	DATE	, as the editor 's note gives it -RRB- , and was , in fact , familiar with
Genet	PERSON	's purposes in sending him to
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		Michaux gives us information on the routes of travel between
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	and the seaboard , and upon the extent of settlement in the period of his visits to the
West	LOCATION	.

		Frangois Andr6
Michaux	PERSON	, the son , is a more valuable traveller , for he wrote fuller accounts of the western country which he visited in
1802	DATE	.

		He also was a botanist of note , and his expedi - tion was undertaken under the auspices of the French Minister of the Interior at the time when
France	LOCATION	had actually received
Louisiana	LOCATION	by treaty , and when she was preparing to take possession .

		He was one of a considerable num - ber of savants sent into the West by
France	LOCATION	, in this period , to report upon the country .

		His descriptions include accounts of
Charleston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and the route to
Pitts	PERSON	- burgh .

		The growing importance of this gate - way of the
Ohio Valley	ORGANIZATION	was recognized by
Michaux	PERSON	, and he gives us an appreciative pic - ture of the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and the return route between the mountains and
Charleston	LOCATION	.

		The time was that when the cultivation of cotton was extending into the up-country of the South , and
Michaux	PERSON	's ac - count of the progress of this movement is highly important .

		But his own preference was for the

		* He gives his opinion ' that the banks of the
Ohio	LOCATION	, from
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	to
Louisville	LOCATION	inclusively , will , in the course of twenty years , be the most pop - ulous and commercial part of the
United States	LOCATION	, and where I should settle in preference to any other . '

		The reader will enjoy his accounts of agriculture and commerce in the
West	LOCATION	.

		He tells of the success of the
Marietta	ORGANIZATION	settlers in ' exporting directly to the
Carribee Islands	LOCATION	the produce of the country , in a vessel built in their own town , which they sent to
Jamaica	LOCATION	' ; of the horse-trade of
Kentucky	LOCATION	with
Charleston	LOCATION	; of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	cattle , driven in droves of from two to three hundred to
Virginia	LOCATION	, along the
Potomac	LOCATION	river , where they were sold to graziers who -LRB- in anticipation of the arrangement between the ranchers of the
Great Plains	LOCATION	and the
Kansas	LOCATION	farmers of our time -RRB- fattened them for the markets of
Baltimore	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; of the lone backwoodsman on the upper
Ohio	LOCATION	, paddling in a canoe to examine the borders of the
Missouri	LOCATION	for a hundred and fifty miles beyond its mouth .

		* His costume , like that of all the American sports - men , consisted of a waistcoat with sleeves , a pair of pantaloons , and a large red and yellow worsted sash .

		A carabine , a tomahawk or little axe , which the Indians make use of to cut wood and to termi - nate the existence of their enemies , two beaver - snares , and a large knife suspended at his side , constituted his sporting dress .

		A rug comprised the whole of his luggage ... Such were the first inhabitants of
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	, of whom there are now remaining but very few .

		It was they who began to clear those fertile countries and wrested them from the savages who ferociously dis - puted their right ; it was they , in short , who made themselves masters of the possessions , after five or six years of bloody war ; but the long habit of a wandering and idle life has prevented their enjoy - ing the fruit of their labors , and profiting by the very price to which these lands have risen in so short a time .

		They have emigrated to more remote parts of the country , and formed new settlements .

		It will be the same with most of those who inhabit the borders of the
Ohio	LOCATION	. '

		He goes on to picture the coming of later emi - grants from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	states , who will replace the log-house with framed dwellings , and extend the clearing to fields of varied agri - culture .

		This volume also contains Dr.
Harris	PERSON	's ' Tour into the
Territory Northwest	ORGANIZATION	of the
Allegheny Mountains	LOCATION	' -LRB- 1803 -RRB- .


Harris	PERSON	was a New Eng - land clergyman , for a time librarian of Har - vg , rd , and a member of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	His - torical Society , and various other learned associations .

		The work contains useful data , but is brief and lacks the charm of description of Western life found in more sympathetic visitors .

		His journey took him through
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania to
Marietta	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and the return .

		As the younger
Michaux	PERSON	portrays an advance of settlement over that described by his father .

		302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	' so
Fortescue Cuming	PERSON	, in his ' Sketches of a Tour to the Western Country ' in 1807-1809 , gives a further stage of growth .

		He was a travelled Englishman , fair in his Judgments , and a good observer .

		The first part of his trip was made on foot from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to
Pitts	PERSON	- burg ; after a sojourn through the winter there , he went by boat to
Marysville	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and thence on horseback through the blue-grass lands of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and back to
Maysville	LOCATION	.

		From here he proceeded along the stage-road through
Chillicothe	LOCATION	and
Zanesville	LOCATION	to Wheeling , and returned to
Pittsburg	LOCATION	.

		The following year he went by boat down the
Ohio	LOCATION	and the Mis - sissippi to
Bayou Pierre	ORGANIZATION	, and thence on horse - back into the settlements of
Mississippi	LOCATION	terri - tory and into
West Florida	LOCATION	.

		Cuming remained long enough in the West to understand its life , and the book abounds in interesting material on the stage of development which
Michaux	PERSON	foresaw -- the development of town-life , and the replacement of the hunter type by the agri - cultural settler and the bustling town-builder .

		It would be impossible here to sketch the con - tents of his work , but it is sufficient to say that it is one of the best of its class .

		The fifth volume contains a summary of con - ditions in
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, lUinois , and the surrounding regions , by
Bradbury	PERSON	, a Scotch naturalist , who accompanied the
Astor	PERSON	- ians in
1810	DATE	to the Mandans , but returned with
Brackenridge	LOCATION	.

		He went down the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to
New Orleans	LOCATION	in
1811	DATE	, and spent the period of the war of
1812	DATE	in the
United States	LOCATION	, pos - sibly making his journey to the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	after this .

		The work is a useful estimate of conditions at the same period as
Cuming	ORGANIZATION	's tour , and adds material on the situation at the close of the war .

		In volume eight , two American travellers give their views of the West in the years
1813	DATE	to
1819	DATE	.

		Buttriok was a New Englander who had made a voyage to the
East Indies	LOCATION	by way of the
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	, and another to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, both of which he describes .

		His love of wandering took him to
Kentucky	LOCATION	in
1814	DATE	, by the route through
New York	LOCATION	to the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	; and in the succeeding year he repeated his journey .

		He gives us an account of emigrants chiefly from
Maine	LOCATION	, who had gath - ered to the number of about twelve hundred at the headwaters of the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	, waiting for the opening of navigation to descend the
Ohio	LOCATION	to seek farms where they might avoid the hard times that followed the war of
1812	DATE	in
New England	LOCATION	.

		He went on to
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and returned over the famous
Natchez	LOCATION	trace through the Indian country -- the route of returning flatboat men .

		Of the perils of travel through this lawless region , he gives a vivid picture .

		In his ' Pedestrious Tour of Four Thousand Miles through the Western States and Terri - tories , '
Estwick Evans	PERSON	, a
New Hampshire	LOCATION	law - yer , evidently eccentric , gives an account of his journey through western
New York	LOCATION	and northern
Ohio	LOCATION	to
Detroit	LOCATION	, and then down the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	, the
Ohio	LOCATION	, and the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, to
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Even his absurd garb of furs , his painfully verbose moralizing , and his other oddities , do not destroy the value of his reports of life in the West after the ravages of the war .

		Michigan territory ,
Indiana	LOCATION	, and
Illi	PERSON	- nois , are described in an important period of their forming society , and the rich life of the Southern plantations on the lower
Mississippi	LOCATION	is brought vividly before the reader .

		When an editor has achieved the deservedly high reputation enjoyed by Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	for the accuracy and clearness of his notes , it i `` ?

		to be expected that critics will find particular enjoyment in the discovery of slips .

		The edi - torial introductions and abundant annota.tions certainly add greatly to the value of this series , presenting much information upon the places visited as well as data regarding the authors and the texts .

		Their value would be en - hanced , however , by more frequent citation of the sources from which the facts arc drawn .

		The notes are not free from mis - prints ; some opportunities are missed , and occasional doubtful statements are foimd .

		In illustration , reference mav be made to the date 1851 for
1853	DATE	-LRB- I. , p. 21 -RRB- '' ^ ; Blainville for Bien - ville -LRB- I. , pp. 23 , 59 -RRB- ; ' ^ eomsmandant ' -LRB- I. , p. 56 -RRB- ; ' Jesuits Eelation ' -LRB- II. , 80 -RRB- .

		It is doubt - ful whether the editor of the ' Jesuit Relations ' should have stated that Lac des Puans -LRB- Stink - ing Lake -RRB- was a name used by the French for Green Bay -LRB- II. , 186 -RRB- .

		When the word Lax : was used , the term was applied either to
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	or to
Lake Winnebago	LOCATION	.

		Evans 's ref - erence to Colonel
Pinkney	PERSON	-LRB- VIIL , p. 159 -RRB- is confused by the editor 's not © spelling the family name '
Pinckney	PERSON	. '

		As an example of neglect - ed opportunities may be instanced the fail - ure to explain the importance of the Black Swamp ` between the
Sandusky	LOCATION	and the ^ lau - mee , in
Harrison	PERSON	's operations in the War of
1812	DATE	.

		Evans calls it ` famous ' for this reason ; but the note -LRB- VIIL , p. 196 -RRB- fails to mention the military importance of the place .

		The maps of the various volumes are carefully reproduced , and the index , promised as the concluding volume of the thirty-one which are to make up the series , will be of great aid to students .

		The publishers have given the travels in these well-printed and substantially bound volumes an excellent setting .

		The large type , ample margins , and good paper , form a pleas - ing contrast to the original editions .

		THE DIAL 303 Some Humax REMiNiscENcrES .

		* Among those nuggets of philosophy scat - tered irrelevantly but not unacceptably through the pages of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's ' Week / is the follow - ing : ` We do not learn much from learned books , but from true , sincere , human books , from frank and honest biographies . '

		A frank and human and at the same time most enter - taining book of the honest biographical , or rather autobiographical , kind is Mrs.
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	's ' Bits of Gossip , ' a piece of writing whose only serious fault is that it is not longer .

		Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	is best known , at least to older readers , by her story of ' Life in the Iron Milk , '' one of the earliest , and perhaps the most powerfully written , of the many sto - ries of laboring-class life in
America	LOCATION	.

		Passing her girlhood successively in western
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, in one of the Gulf states , and in
West Virginia	LOCATION	, and her maturer years chiefly in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, with interspersed sojourns in
New England	LOCATION	and elsewhere , Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	views her fellow countrymen and women with no provincial narrowness of vision , and conmients on their sectional peculiarities with the large tolerance and understanding of one to whom fulness of years and wealth of experience have brought kindliness as well as wisdom .

		Espe - cially appreciative of excellences and tolerant of defects is she in her attitude toward the slaveholding Southerner of ante-bellum days , and his deadly enemy the abolitionist North - erner .

		Living on the neutral border as she did for some years before and during the war , this clear-eyed observer was able to see both sides of the perplexing question , -- a far less comfortable frame of mind , as she truly remarks , than that of the thorough-going par - tisan .

		But a wise impartiality surely reaps its rewards in the end .

		In keeping with this unbiased attitude , -- a coolness and fairness of judgment not too common in women , -- is Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	's delightfully honest and not too reverential treatment of the
New England	LOCATION	worthies whom sbe met on her first visit to Bos - ton and
Concord	LOCATION	.

		Here is the way she prefaces her recollections of them : ' I wish I could summon these memorable ghosts before you as I saw them then and afterward .

		To the eyes of an observer , belonging to the common - place world , they did not appear precisely as they do in the portraits drawn of them for posterity by their companions , the other Areopagites , who walked and talked with them apart -- always apart from humanity .

		That was the first peculiarity which struck an outsider in
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and the other members of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' coterie ; that while they thought they were guiding the real world , they stood quite outside of it , and never would see it as it was . '

		* Bits of Gossip .

		By
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		She is particularly severe on the ' would-be seer ' whose memorable achievement in carpentry was the rustic arbor he built for
Emerson	PERSON	' to do his thinking in , ' -- a very artistic and well - appointed structure , except that it had no door , and so no one could use it .

		To the lady from
Virginia	LOCATION	, this wonderful edifice seemed ' a fit - ting symbol for this guild of prophets and their scheme of life . '

		We have read much of Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	's praise of vegetarianism .

		A page from Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	's book may perhaps help us to rate these laudations at their true value .

		We quote , as the author has written , with no unkindness of purpose .

		Indeed , one can hardly help liking the amiable dreamer all the better after viewing his innocent absurdities through Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	's eyes .

		` Early that morning , when his lank , gray figure had first appeared at the gate , Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	said : `` Here comes the Sage of
Concord	LOCATION	.

		He is anxious to know what kind of human beings come up from the back hills of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Now I will tell you , '' his eyes gleaming with fun , `` what he will talk to you about .

		Pears .

		Yes .

		You may begin at Plato or the day 's news , and he will come around to pears .

		He is now convinced that a vegetable diet affects both the body and soul , and that pears exercise a more direct and ennobling influence on us than any other vegetable or fruit .

		Wait , You 'll hear pres - ently . ''

		When we went in to dinner , therefore , 1 was surprised to see the sage eat heartily of the fine sirloin of beef set before us .

		But with the dessert he began to advocate a vegetable diet , and at last announced the spiritual influence of pears , to the great delight of his host , who laughed like a boy and was humored like one by the gentle old man . '

		The Transcendentalists are one and all han - dled , not roughly , but certainly without gloves , by Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	.

		Her estimate of them can be given in no better words than her own .

		`
New England	LOCATION	then swarmed with weak-brained , imitative folk who had studied books with more or less zeal , ' and who knew nothing of actyal life .

		They were suffering under the curse of an education which they could not use ; they were the lean , under - fed men and women of villages and farms , who were trained enough to be lawyers and teachers in their communities , but who actually were cobblers , mill-hands , or tailoresses .

		They had revolted from Puritanism , not to enter any other live church , but to fall into a dull disgust , a nausea with all religion .

		To them came this new prophet with his discovery of the God within themselves .

		They hailed it with acclamation .

		The new dialect of the
Transcenden	PERSON	- talist was easily learned .

		They talked it as cor - rectly as the Chinaman does his pigeon English .

		Up to the old gray house among the pines in
Concord	LOCATION	they went -- hordes of wild-eyed
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	under - graduates and lean , underpaid working-women , each with a disease of soul to be cured by the new Healer . '

		The author 's presentation of the great ones of
Boston	LOCATION	and neighborhood is almost always shrewd , and furnishes excellent reading , how - ever much the reader may at times feel inclined to dissent .

		But when , in praise of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, she denies to him all self - consciousness , and Sd4 THE DIAIi -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, writes that ` he prabaMy never knew that he was different ' from those around him , and that ' he knew and cared little about
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	/ one can not suppress a word of emphatic disagreement .

		A man can not spin romances out of his brain and drop his plummet into the hidden depths of our common human nature without gaining , from the introspection involved , some very real sense of his own capaci - ties and limitations , and an abiding conscious - ness of the awful mystery that each is to him - self even more than to his fellows .

		We linger perhaps unduly over this chapter on `
Boston	LOCATION	in the Sixties , ' but one more quotation demands insertion .

		It is a rather startling characteriza - tion of Thoreau by his friend
Emerson	PERSON	.

		` He said to me suddenly once , `` I wish
Thoreau	PERSON	had not died before you came .

		He was an interest - ing study . ''

		`` Why ? ''

		I asked .

		`` Why ?

		Thoreau ? ''

		He hesitated , thinking , going apparently to the bot - tom of the matter , and said presently : `` Henry often reminded me of an animal in human form .

		He had the eye of a bird , the scent of a dog , the most acute , delicate intelligence , -- but no soul .

		No , '' he repeated , shaking his head with decision , `` Henry could not have had a human soul . '' '

		It is refreshing to read an author so out of humor with the commercial spirit of the age as is Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	.

		She was reared in a community where discussion of money matters was consid - ered vulgar , and any reference to one 's own or one 's neighbor 's pecuniary condition the ex - treme of bad taste .

		She cherishes , too , the old - fashioned reverence for things sacred .

		` With a conceit quite unconscious of its own absurd - ity , ' she writes , ' each college boy and girl puts the Almighty and His Messenger to man on trial , and pronounces judgment on them . '

		Yet she is not without hope for the future even in this particular ; for ` after all , ' she says , ` we are a young nation , and vanity is a fault of youth .

		We will -LSB- t. e. shall -RSB- grow out of it presently . '

		Writing of those who wrought for the free - ing of the slave , she speaks as follows of Low - ell ,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and Beecher : '
Lowell	PERSON	's politics and poetry were , as a rule , kept inside of his books .

		He himself in every-day life was so simple , so sincere , so human , that you forgot he had any higher calling than that of being the most charming of companions .

		Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, on the contrary , was always the poet and the Abolitionist .

		He did not consciously pose , but he never for a moment forgot his mission .

		He was thin , mild , and ascetic , looking like a Presbyterian country minis - ter .

		He gave his views of slavery and the South with a gentle , unwearied obstinacy , exasperating to anyone who knew that there was another side to the question .

		I never saw a human being with a personality more aggressive than that of Henry
Ward Beecher	PERSON	... He had an enormous following of men and a few women .

		But , back of the heavy jaws and thick lips and searching eyes swathed in drooping lids , back of the powerful intellect and tender sympathy , there was a nameless something in Mr.
Beecher	PERSON	which repelled most women .

		You resolved obstinately not to agree with his argu - ment , not to laugh or cry with him , not to see him again .

		Perhaps it is ungracious in me to tell this .

		But I can not give the impression he made without it .

		He was always Dr. Fell to me , in spite of his strength and the wonderful charm of his sympathy with every living creature . '

		After this avowal of temperamental antipathy to
Beecher	PERSON	, one is not surprised to learn that Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	was no worshipper of
Walt Whit	ORGANIZATION	- man .

		To her , ' Whitman simply was indecent , as thousands of other men are indecent , who are coarse by nature and vulgar by breeding . '

		Many interesting things are related of Clay and
Blaine	PERSON	, the former of whom was the political idol of her youth , and the latter a distant cousin and a fellow resident of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, her birthplace .

		She writ ^ with every advantage of an intimate and lifelong acquaintance ; but when she declares of Blaine that this ` melan - choly idler ... at heart did not care whether he ever entered the
White House	ORGANIZATION	or not , ' we are not entirely convinced .

		By the way , to refer to
Washington	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, is about as definite as referring to
Smithville	LOCATION	or
Farmington	LOCATION	,
U. S.	PERSON	, as there are twenty-three Washingtons in
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania , according to
Lippdncott	ORGANIZATION	's Gazetteer .

		But the context makes it reasonably certain that
Washington	LOCATION	of
Washington County	LOCATION	is meant .

		Another criticism may be ventured in this same field of geography .

		Why does the author invar - iably spell
Culpeper	LOCATION	-LRB- the
Virginia	LOCATION	county and town -RRB- with three p 's ?

		The Virginians of that district are , we believe , rather careful to dis - tinguish their county and county-seat from the condiment containing three labials .

		Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	has given us a little book that is sane and wise and cheerful , as well as enter - taining .

		Perhaps one reason why she is so good a romancer is that she has so firm a hold on reality and so keen a scent for sham and hum - bug ; and she clothes her reality in so attractive a guise because she is quick to see the romantic in character and situation .

		THE DIAL 305 the history of
Europe	LOCATION	between the fall of the
Eoman Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the Eenaissance is an elabo - rate fable worked out in a widely ramified liter - ary conspiracy of the Benedictine monasteries .

		With the self-interest of the Benedictines as a pou sto , the author easily heaves the medisBval world , as we assume to know it , out of exist - ence .

		The boolc , a generously handsome octavo of over 600 pages , consists of a memoir of its author by
Edward A. Petherick	PERSON	, a Part I. devoted to the
Benedictines	LOCATION	and their varied activities , and a Part II .

		devoted to following their trail through the historical writings of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries .

		Why the book , written ten years before the author 's death , was not printed until nearly three years after his death , is nowhere appar - ent .

		From Mr.
Petherick	PERSON	's memoir we learn that the book is the last of a series : ^ Antiqua Mater , ' ' The Rise of
Christendom	LOCATION	, ' and ' The Rise of English Culture . ' '

		Coming sud - denly , after months of earnest research , upon a clue , it was gradually revealed to him that the actual writers of the Church and Gospel his - tories were not ancient .

		Not one only , or a few only , of the supposed ancient writers seemed to write in a sixteenth ^ entury manner , as
Canon Westcott	ORGANIZATION	had remarked of Jerome : nearly all of them belonged to that late period . '

		What the clue is , is not very clear .

		But
Pethe	PERSON	- rick makes much of the fact that both
Bryce	PERSON	and
Freeman	PERSON	comment on the absence of mediae - val monuments in
Rome	LOCATION	; and regarding Pales - tine , he makes such assertions as this : ' Other inscriptions have been found in abundance , but not a single Hebrew word . '

		Here we may turn to Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	himself .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	places the seat of Judaism in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Here about the year 1200 , ' Maimonides gave the Jews a Creed ; and it was near to Mai - monides ' time that the Hebrew Scriptures were written , beg ` an to be recited in the Synagogues and to be commented on by the Rabbins ... Now , the Benedictine corporation could not have come into existence before the Hebrew Scriptures were in some version known to them , because they base their system of teaching upon a certain interpretation of those Scriptures ... -LSB- The Benedictines -RSB- constructed out of their study of `` the Old Testament , '' as they called the Hebrew Scriptures , another book which they chose to call '' the New Testament . '' '

		The Bene - dictine Order , like its older rival the Syn - agogue , invented a charter , a quasi divine patent for their greed and rapacity .

		But they did more .

		They planned and executed a multi - farious fable , -- first , to fill out an assumed antiquity of the Order ; secondly , over and over again ` to define the dogma of the Order by setting up an imaginary heretic to teach its opposite ' ; thirdly , to secure material advan - tages to themselves by feigning long established use of possessions and tributes . '

		And who can dispossess his memory of the saying put into the mouth of the genial and secular-minded Pope
Leo X.	PERSON	, -- '' How profitable to us that fable of Jesu ^ Christ ! '' '

		From among the names which the author attaints by means of quotation marks , we may cull the following : '
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, ' '
Tertul	PERSON	- lian , ' ' St. Basil the Great , ' ' Isidore of
Seville	LOCATION	, ' `
Eusebius Pamphili	LOCATION	, ' ` St.
Gregory the Great	PERSON	, ' '
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, ' ' Scotus , ' ' Gregory of Tours , ' '
Bede	PERSON	, ' ' Alcuin , ' ' Lanf ranc , ' ' Anselm , ' ` Wiclif , ' ` Charlemagne , ' ` Alfred the Great , ' ` William the Conqueror . '

		Columbus was in - vented to derive to the monks the glory of a discovery really made later and at first doubted and flouted by them .

		The second part of the book is the one to which the title of the whole work is properly applicable .

		Five chapters are devoted to Poly - dore
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	as a critic and dupe .

		Specific adulterations are pointed out and explained as allegories of what was going on in
Henry VIII	LOCATION	.

		's reign .

		E. g. , ' The law Ne exeas regno is put in force when required , under Henry -
VIII	PERSON	.

		It also is traced up to the tyrannic sys - tem of exaction and confiscation under Rufus .

		.

		.

		Norman fable again proves to be Tudor fact . '

		In the chapter on
Leland	LOCATION	, the author argues that
Chaucer	PERSON	is the syndicate name of a number of Tudor wits ; and in the next chap - ter , on Early Printed Books , that
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	is an hypostasis of the printing confraternity , the Benedictine hoof being visible in the printer 's use of the word chapel .

		The Inns of Courts were a school of poetry , for the law-books that should have been studied had not yet been invented .

		In the chapter on
Public Records	ORGANIZATION	, the existence of such records before the Tudor period is with much circumstance denied .

		The Bible in
England	LOCATION	, The New Testament , Poets and Critics , -- whatever the heading , the tenor of the Chapter is the same .

		The tale , indeed , becomes monotonous .

		The conclusion is nerve - less by comparison with the main thesis : it is hardly more than a homily on the
Truth of Letters and Science	ORGANIZATION	and the rival Truth pro- claimed by the Church ; and there is a curious intimation that in
America	LOCATION	and the
Colonies the Truth of Letters and Science	ORGANIZATION	will be estab - lished .

		That this book will strike the trained scholar as preposterous , is certain at the outset .

		But the author is himself a trained scholar , a man of great erudition and some method .

		Thus the book distinguishes itself from such works as ' The Great Cryptogram ' of
Ignatius Donnelly	PERSON	and similar books that believe nothing and 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, believe it with unswerving fatuity .

		By com - parison with them , it seems worthy of a matter - of-fax3t refutation .

		Such a refutation would be the proper task of an historian .

		In one way , however , it may best be made by ancillary sciences .

		A breath of one of these may prove more potent than the shock of a phalanx of the enemy -- here , accepted historical criticism .

		Let us then take a look at the philological aspect of the author 's theory .

		The theory implies , and the author elsewhere explicitly states , that ' Anglo-Saxon letters are a sixteenth century invention . '

		Surely , the author could have had no idea of what such a statement car - ried with it .

		It means the invention of archaic forms of language such that scholars three hun - dred years later could work out a chronological and geographical gradation of forms , a many - branched linguistic history covering a thousand years ; this history , moreover , agreeing in prin - ciple with the history of other Germ ` anic lan - guages , and also with that of the Romance and the classical languages .

		It means the inven - tion of forms which show , when observed in the established chronology , phonetic changes con - formable to physiological laws not understood until three hundred and fifty years after the supposed invention , and of forms unintelligible as forms to any comparison with cognate tongues , yet perfectly clear when , three hundred years after the supposed invention , Sanskrit and the earlier forms of Latin and Greek came to be studied .

		The invention of an historical system of men , events , laws , and customs , which Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	attributes to the
Benedictines	LOCATION	, is an act of human intellect far outstripping the greatest yet known -- the Ptolemaic system of astronomy .

		But the incidental invention of the multifarious phenomena of Germanic and Romanic linguistics outstrips the historical fabulation far more than that outstrips the ' Sphere With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o'er .

		Cycle and Epicycle , orb in orb . '

		Grimm and
Sievers	PERSON	and Sweet would no doubt enjoy converse with the abbot whose stupendous genius uttered this truly Jehovan fiat .

		Non liquet .

		But even if it did , of what use could such a Babel made-to-measure have been ?

		The phenomenon we call umlaut , for instance , adds no whit of credibility to any part of this alleged fabrication .

		The supererogation of the invention is quite as unparalleled as the inven - tion itself would have been .

		Again , the Bene - dictines , or qui que ce soit , might have in - vented Chaucerian metrics from sixteenth - century English and French usage .

		But why should they have invented alliterative verse , -- or , inventing it , why did they invent such distinct varieties of it as are exemplified in
Langland	LOCATION	, in Genesis A and Old English poetry generally , and in Genesis B and the continental poetry generally ?

		Why did they think it neces - sary to have a

		Negro Slavery in
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		* In the work under review we have in the fullest detail an account of negro servitude in
Illinois	LOCATION	, one of the states supposed by the student of school histories to have been pre - served by the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	from the blighting influence of slavery .

		In the early chapters , the author traces the history of negro slavery during the period of the French and English occupation , and during the existence of the territorial and state governments , to the period of anti-slavery agitation that began in the
' 30	DATE	's .

		The judicial decisions are explained in detail , until the final decisions destroyed negro servitude in
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Much the greater part of the volume is devoted to the histor -RCB- ^ of the anti-slavery agitation and its local mani - festations in the state , and to the rise of the several political parties that made use of the abolition sentiment .

		A final chapter sketches the progress , or rather the lack of progress , of popular sentiment in regard to the negro .

		A complete and scientific bibliography is ap - pended .

		In the appendix are also some inter - esting papers relating to
Illinois	LOCATION	slavery , -- sale papers , indentures , and letters from the masters of slaves .

		A table is given showing the growth of the anti-slaverv vote , from 160 in
1840	DATE	to 172,196 in
1860	DATE	.

		` The illustrations consist of a photograph of the

Stephen A. Doug	PERSON	- las .

		Of slavery in
Illinois	LOCATION	as a social institution , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	says almost nothing .

		His concern is with the legal status of the negroes .

		Negro slavery was introduced into the
Illinois	LOCATION	country by the French ; the English conquest in
1763	DATE	did not affect slavery , nor were property rights disturbed by
Virginia	LOCATION	, which gained the terri - tory during the Revolution .


Virginia	LOCATION	ceded her claims to the
United States	LOCATION	on condition that all inhabitants be allowed to retain all their possessions and their ancient rights .

		The Ordinance of
1787	DATE	guaranteed the continuation of these rights and at the same time prohibited slavery in the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		This anti- slavery clause was interpreted by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, by the territorial governors , and by the people , as prohibiting the introduction of more slaves , -- not as destroying slavery in the territory and hence making it free territory , nor as prohibit - ing limited servitude .

		Consequently , from this time until
1848	DATE	, when slavery was destroyed by *
The History of Negro Servitude	ORGANIZATION	in
Illinois	LOCATION	, and of the Anti-Slavery Agitation in that
State	ORGANIZATION	,

		308 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, a new constitution , there were three classes of negroes in
Illinois	LOCATION	, -- slaves for life , belonging to the French settlers and their descendants ; indentured servants , bound to a master for a term of years , often as long as life ; and free negroes with no civil status .

		A slave-owner from
Virginia	LOCATION	or
Kentucky	LOCATION	might come into
Illinois	LOCATION	with his slaves , and by a process of registration , supposedly ' voluntary ' on the part of the negroes , change them into servants bound for terms of two to ninety-nine years .

		Thus the substance of slavery was preserved , under a different form , and in spite of the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	.

		To regulate the slaves and indentured servants , a code of laws , borrowed from the slave codes of
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Kentucky	LOCATION	, was drawn up in
1803	DATE	.

		These * Black Laws ' remained on the statute-books until repealed , as late as
February 7 , 1865	DATE	.

		This code regu - lated the treatment of the servants , their food and clothes , term of service , and punishment ; it provided for a pass system , and made it illegal for whites to trade with them .

		The servants had no standing in law .

		Under this code , they were bought , sold , and bequeathed by will , as if they were
Mississippi	LOCATION	slaves ; and the prices paid --
$ 300	MONEY	to
$ 600	MONEY	for boys and girls , and
$ 800	MONEY	to
$ 1,000	MONEY	for men -- prove that the limitations on servitude had little effect on the value of the slave .

		In
1818	DATE	, when the state constitution was formed , probably a majority of the
Illinois	LOCATION	set - tlers wanted a pro-slavery constitution ; but , from motives of expediency , the one adopted allowed only a limited servitude except in the case of the French slaves .

		However , there were many who wanted unlimited negro slavery ; and from
1820	DATE	to
1824	DATE	there was a contest to secure two-thirds of the legislature in order to have a convention called which , it was expected , would revise the constitution and legally establish negro slavery .

		The necessary number was secured ; but a majority of the people , some of them disgusted by the methods of the con - vention party , voted against having a conven - tion , the vote being 6,640 to 4,972 .

		This victory decided that immigration to
Illi	PERSON	- nois should be from the
East	LOCATION	, and not from the South ; the Southerner did not feel safe in risk - ing his negro property under the laws of
Illi	PERSON	- nois .

		Yet there was then no anti-slavery movement ; in fact , the laws and court decisions gradually strengthened the master 's hold upon his servants .

		In
1828	DATE	,
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	decided that the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	was not binding upon the state of
Illinois	LOCATION	, having been suspended by the constitution of
1818	DATE	.

		It further decided that ` registered servants are goods and chattels , and can be sold on execu - tion . '

		But about
1835	DATE	, influenced by the grow - ing anti-slavery sentiment , the courts began to limit the operation of the ' Black Laws ' by enforcing registration , by declaring the children of servants to be free , by reversing the decision of
1828	DATE	which declared that servants were chat - tels , by forbidding the sale of servants , and finally , in
1843	DATE	, by deciding that residence in a free state made a free man of a slave volun - tarily brought in by his master .

		The courts of
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and
Missouri	LOCATION	had al - ready asserted this principle .

		In
1844	DATE	, the rem - nant of French slavery was abolished by the courts .

		All servitude not imposed by the state was destroyed by the constitution of
1848	DATE	, and in
1864	DATE	the supreme court decided that the state could not sell a free negro immigrant into slavery .

		So the last negro became free a year before Lincoln died .

		The laws of
Illinois	LOCATION	were always in favor of slavery until
1865	DATE	; the supreme court until about
1835	DATE	was pro-slavery , and after that date was controlled by anti- slavery sentiment rather than guided by law or precedent .

		But while the slaves were thus gaining free - dom through the courts the laws and public opinion were making the position of the free negro unbearable .

		He was ill-treated and scorned and abused in all places ; he had no standing in the courts , no rights , civil or politi - cal , and though forced to pay taxes he was not allowed to send his children to school .

		In order not to be sold into servitude , he must have a certificate of freedom , and must furnish a thousand-dollar bond that he would not become a public charge .

		There was much opposition to the presence of the free negroes , and the con - stitution of
1848	DATE	, which destroyed domestic slavery , gave the legislature autiiority to pre - vent free negro immigration .

		This article of the constitution was adopted by a majority of 28,182 ; and in
1853	DATE	a law was passed to enforce it by selling free negro immigrants into servitude .

		In spite of all anti-slavery agitation , the sentiment of the people did not soften toward the free negro .

		A proposed constitution was rejected in
1862	DATE	, by 16,051 majority ; yet an article of that constitution forbid - ding the immigration of negroes was accepted by a majority of 100,590 , and an article pro- hibiting negro suffrage was adopted by a ma - jority of 176,271 , only 35,649 voting against it .

		tinder such influences , the free negro pop - ulation did not increase rapidly , many prefer - ring to remain slaves ; many of the free negroes were kidnapped by thrifty Illinoisians and sold to the Southern planters .

		The position of the negro since emancipation has improved but lit - tle , the author thinks , although the unfavorable laws have disappeared from the statute-books .

		In tracing the rise of anti-slavery - sentiment in
Illinois	LOCATION	, Mr.
Harris	PERSON	does not clearly distin - ffuish between the various kinds of anti-slavery
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 people .

		Some were opposed to slavery in
Illi	LOCATION	- nois ; others to slavery anywhere ; some wanted no negroes at all in the state , othersi wanted only free negroes ; some were abolitionists from moral reasons , others because of politics , and still others because of economic reasons .

		All of these Mr.
Harris	PERSON	puts together as anti-sla - very men , or abolitionists .

		In reality , there was little genuine anti-slavery sentiment in
Illinois	LOCATION	until the
late ' 50	DATE	's .

		Most of the people wanted no negroes , slave or free , but were not inclined to meddle with slavery in the South .

		This is proved by the
Lovejoy	PERSON	episode , and by the fact that an anti-slavery organization could not be maintained nor an anti-slavery paper be sup - ported .

		The attempts at founding an anti- slavery political party resulted in failure until
1856	DATE	.

		Slavery in
Illinois	LOCATION	politics was hardly a moral issue , in spite of the efforts of the author to show high moral motives in the anti- slavery politicians .

		Much space is devoted to anti-slavery politics ; every platform and every vote is given , every candidate named , but , with few exceptions , it looks like a case of the * Outs ' trying to become the '
Ins	ORGANIZATION	, ' and slavery is used as a good weapon in the struggle .

		We discount the sympathy expressed for the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	slave , when we know that nothing whatever was done for the few free negroes in their midst .

		Dislike for the master led the abolitionist to aid run - away slaves , but the latter must not stop in the state ; no voice was raised for the free negro .

		We should now admire those abolitionists more had they succored the wretches at their own doors instead of stirring up the flames of sec - tional hatred by the course they pursued .

		A queer instance of their ethics is shown in the
Lovejoy	LOCATION	episode :
Lovejoy	LOCATION	, seeing that no good was likely to come of his agitation , wrote a letter resigning the editorship of the abolition paper at
Alton	LOCATION	.

		The letter was to be published , but an intimate friend suppressed it , and con - sequently Ix -RRB- vejoy went on to his death at the hands of the mob .

		The peculiar composition of the population of
Illinois	LOCATION	materially influenced politics .

		The central and southern counties were controlled by men of Southern birth or descent ; the north - em counties were settled from the
East	LOCATION	, and were usually opposed in politics to the southern part .

		Most of the negroes were in the southern counties .

		To favor negro immigration was to favor the political opposition , and naturally the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	settler opposed anything that would strengthen the Southern settlers or cause more of them to come into the state .

		Mr.
Har	PERSON	- ris would have done well had he traced more thoroughly the sectional influences in the state ; a few good maps would reconcile his readers to the omission of the illustrations used .

		The author is decidedlv abolitionist in his sympathies ; for the pro-slavery Democrats and the Southern settlers he shows slight respect .

		A wealth of adjectives enables him to express his appreciation of the former and his dislike of the latter , yet this feeling seems almost colorless ; the dry recital of names , dates , and platforms causes one to welcome these expres - sions of opinions , which seem rather to be inher - ited than formed as a result of knowledge .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	proceeds upon the assumption that the faith of the anti-slavery men was always good , their motives pure and unselfish , their char - acter and intelligence above the average ; but he is suspicious of all that pertains to their opponents , and is inclined to believe them guilty of the secret plans and treacherous methods that went out with dynastic politics .

		Of the aboKtionists he says : * The spirit displayed by these men was admirable , and worthy of a noble cause . '

		* Enough can not be said in praise of the self sacrifice , the patient perseverance , the conscientious devotion to duty , the high sense of political honor , and withal the genial liber - ality of these men . '

		Of
the Southern	ORGANIZATION	. '

		element in the population , he says that those from the
Carolinas	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	were ' ignorant , shiftless , and obstinate , ' ' imscruipulous and dishonest ' ; '
Andrew Borders	PERSON	, a man well-known for his cruelty and rapacity , ... a true Southerner ' ; ` these people -LSB- of
Southern Illinois	LOCATION	-RSB- were as narrow-minded and stubborn as they were kind - hearted and hospitable . '

		He says that the negro is still persecuted as of old , and ' a state of affairs very similar to that in the South exists there . '

		It is but fair to say that these expressions of feeling do not seem to be the result of personal prejudice , but rather the reflection of the spirit of the time caught from research among its documents , or acquired through tradition as a matter of course , like the small Southern bo/s belief that ` Yankees have horns , ' or the opinion of the
New York	LOCATION	schoolboy that ' Southern people are blaek and lazy . '

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	evidently does not know his negro except through documents ; he states that ` to a white man all negroes look alike , ' and he locates
Hampton Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		No attention is paid to the influence of eco - nomic forces that were working for the extinc - tion of slavery ; the anti-slavery and anti-negro sentiments of the Southern settlers -LRB- like Lin - coln -RRB- , who fled from slavery , are not considered important ; the almost universal ' lily white ' feeling , and its importance , escaped him alto - gether ; with him , the task was to work out the anti-slavery history of
Illinois	LOCATION	as a moral and humanitarian movement , which it was not , to any great degree .

		The result is that we have all the facts , but the collector was unable to interpret them ; he really did not understand 310 THE DIAL -LSB-

		What is Known of Earthquakes .

		* The study of earthquakes , from the view - point of the new seismology , must be consid - ered as somewhat technical .

		For such a study is really a branch of physics , and concerns itself with the laws of the propagation of waves in the solid body of the earth .

		To treat this sub - ject in such fashion that it will be as pleasant and easy to master as an ordinary novel , is quite an impossible feat .

		Nevertheless , Major Button , whose reputation as a student of geol - ogy and an investigator of earthquakes is inter - national , has succeeded in explaining and pop - ularizing the new seismology in a noteworthy degree , in his recent book upon that subject .

		In a very few cases , a formula , modest in dimensions and easy to understand , finds its way into the text , and saves much circumlocu - tion ; but the book is practically free from mathematical symbols .

		The introductory chapter aims to acquaint the reader with the general terms used in the discussion of these phenomena , and to describe the various ways in which an earthquake com - monly manifests itself .

		The author then explains the two principal causes of earth - quakes , which are volcanic action and the mys - terious force which shows itself in various -LRB- Us - locations of the earth 's crust , such as mountain building and other displacements which might be caused by gradual contraction of the earth , or by subterranean influences of the precise nature of which we are ignorant .

		The most dreadful earthquakes are shown to be non-vol - canic in origin .

		The best modern instruments for detecting quakes , and also for measuring the complex motions of the earth 's surface during these disturbances , are described in detail , and the four sorts of waves produced are discussed .

		The different scal ^ used for measuring the intensity of shocks are explained , and the speeds of the various kinds of waves are deter - mined .

		It is shown that all recorded earth - quakes originate at depths probably never as great as twenty miles .

		Yet the vibration ?

		caused are , in the case of great quakes , trans - mitted through and around the earth to dis - tances of thousands of miles .

		the different classes of vibrations travel is a difficult matter , and is of the highest impor - tance in revealing the nature of the earth 's interior .

		Major Button therefore devotes three chapters to this part of the subject .

		One of the conclusions drawn is that the more deeply rocks lie imbedded in the earth 's crust , the more elastic and rigid they are .

		On the whole , the rigidity of the earth must be very great .

		Two of the closing chapters of the book treat of the geographical distribution of earthquakes ; it appears that they are most frequent where the earth 's crust is most rugged and highly diversified in profile .

		The final chapter is devoted to the very interesting topic of * sea - quakes . '

		This term is applied , to peculiar agita - tions of the sea which cause ships to tremble , and are often accompanied by a strange roar emanating from the water ; they are due to any force which lifts or depresses the sea-bottom or the littoral .

		The exhaustive tables of De Mon - tessus de Ballore , founded upon reliable data from 131,292 quakes , showing the geographical distribution of seismicity , are inserted as an appendix .

		The book is packed with many deteils which it is impossible to mention in limited space .

		The typographical dress of the volume , and the excellence of the full-page plates and other illustrations which adorn it , Ijefit the sterling merits of the work .

		THE DIAL 311 if not exactly of flagging energies , at least of a lack of that concentration of power which the most serious art demands .

		No such apology as this , however , need be made for ` The Son of Royal Langbrith , ' which is the latest of his long series of novels .

		In this work he appears before the public at his highest and surest , joining with the invention and grasp of his best early books a heightened degree of that i-eflective rip > eness which comes only with the advancing years .

		It is one of the finest books he has ever written ; one of the best American novels of our time .

		The situation depicted is old enough , although the publishers naively describe it as ` new in fic - tion ' ; but this offers no bar to our satisfaction .

		The oldest situations are apt to be the best , and the only fair criterion of judgment must be , not the choice of the situation , but the use that is made of it .

		The story is of
James Langbrith	PERSON	, who has been brought up to revere the memory of the father whom he lost in childhood .

		This ancestor-worship has become with him a sort of cult , and he loves to dwell upon the sturdy vir - tues and quiet philanthropies in the exercise of which the father had made himself a shining example to his fellow-men .

		But the real facts of the case are that this same father was an unmitigated scoundrel , who built up his own fortunes at the expense of others , and who posed as a pillar of resi > ectability while leading a dis - solute life .

		When the son grows up and is graduated from
Harvard	LOCATION	, these facts are known to only three people in the little manufacturing town which is the scene of the novel .

		One is his long-suffering mother , who has never dared to undeceive him ; the other two are the dead man 's brother -LRB- now in charge of his mills -RRB- and the old family physician .

		For the rest of the community -- the young and the new-comers -- the old pious legend of
Royal Langbrith	ORGANIZATION	's virtues is as fixed a fact as the patriotism of
George Washington	LOCATION	.

		Thus is raised the moral problem with which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has chosen to deal .

		That he deals with it subtly and judiciously , allowing a fair hearing to all the conflicting considerations , is a matter of course .

		Just how the problem is worked out is of less importance than the way in which it is put , -- a way which is strikingly that of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's ` Ghosts , ' although in the present case there is no problem of heredity superadded to make the outcome horrible .

		But the truth has to be revealed , and when it has been revealed , -- by accident , as it were , rather than of set purpose on the part of those who have kept it hidden , -- Ave see clearly enough how sophistical were the reasonings of those who , knowing what it was , had advised that it be left buried forever .

		Fortunately , the revelation brings with it no need of tragedy , and its chastening effect upon the enlightened son seems to be just what that young man needs for the shaping of his character .

		There is one situation to which the novelist can always have recourse when others fail him , -- the situation offered by the marriage of a strong man to a weak woman , or of a weak man to a strong woman .

		It is always possible t - > treat this relation with some degree of fresh - ness , because the variations upon the theme are practically inexhaustible .

		Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's ` The Common Lot ' is based upon this relation , and he has chosen to depict the latter of the two possible cases .

		The man of his book is a young architect , bent upon worldly success , and gradually yielding to one temptation after another until a sort of dry-rot has come to permeate his entire moral organism .

		The woman has a character of Puritan sensitiveness in mat - ters of right and wrong , but she makes the too - frequent mistake of idealizing the man whom she loves , until first instinct and then proof of a more sensible nature gradually do their work of disillusionment .

		When she learns the truth , she deserts her husband until such time as he shall realize his degradation and seek her for - giveness .

		The climax comes with the destruc - tion by fire of a hotel building of the architect 's construction , and the loss of many lives .

		It was a contractor ' ?

		building , dishonestly erected Avith the connivance of the architect .

		This trag - edy opens his eyes to the true meaning of the practices into which he has fallen , and by con - fession and restitution he makes what tardy reparation is within his power .

		Reunited with his wife , he starts to rebuild his broken career -- this time upon an honest foundation ; and there the story ends .

		We hesitate to call it the best of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's books , because we think highly of the others ; but it is without doubt a strong piece of work , such as few of our novelists could hope to equal .

		It has much variety of character and scene , almost photographically observed , and it has many interesting incidents of secondary importance ; but its chief virtue is to be found in the impressiveness with which it presents the ethical problem , and enforces -LRB- by artistic impli - cation -RRB- the teaching that the moral life is a unity , -- that conduct can not be a matter of com - partments , but that each of our acts must affect all the others for good or for evil .

		` There arose a smothered feline screech as from a tiger whose back is broken in a dead -

		Richard gave his wrist the shadow of a twist , and
Snorri	ORGANIZATION	fell on one knee .

		Then , as though it were some foul thing ,
Richard	PERSON	tossed aside
Snorri	ORGANIZATION	's hand , from the nails of which blood came oozing in black drops as large as grapes . '

		In such fashion does heroism cope with villainy in the first chapter of ` The President , ' and thus are we assured that virtue will be triumphant in the end .

		Those who like their fiction highly-colored and strenuous will find their account in this melodramatic tale by Mr.
Alfred Henry Lewis	PERSON	.


Snorri	ORGANIZATION	is a Russian of the deep - est dye , who seeks to marry the daughter of Senator
Hanway	PERSON	, and to loot the
United States Treasury	ORGANIZATION	by tunnelling beneath its foundations .


Richard	PERSON	, who is a multi-millionaire incognito , seeks the hand of the same young woman , and thwarts the burglarious designs of his desperate rival with a degree of success as shining as
Snorri	ORGANIZATION	's discomfiture is black .

		These are but sample elements of the interest with which the novel is crammed .

		We have also such matters 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	; as the revenge of an outraged woman , a colossal stock-jobbing operation , and an intrigue for the presidency .

		This political feature , which we mention last , is really the substance of the book , which takes us to the seats of the mighty at
Washington	LOCATION	, and bids us behold the inner work - ings of the great confidence-game which is called polities .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	has no style to speak of , but he has picturesque invention in plenty , and is anything but commonplace .

		Mr.
Mark Lee Luther	PERSON	's new novel , ` The Mas - tery , ' is a vigorous production , although it does not seem to us quite the equal of ` The
Hench	PERSON	- man ' in interest .

		It is primarily a strictly local - ized story of
New York	LOCATION	politics , although it also embodies a love-story which crops out now and then when the exigencies of the political situa - tion permit the hero to spare a breathing-spell for sentiment .

		In the end , he proves equally triumphant in love and in politics .

		This sort of novel , the work of tense diction , nervous energy , and harsh actuality , is being produced in great quantities at the present time , and is not with - out a certain value .

		But the value is of the kind that belongs to journalism rather than to literature .

		Those who have read Mr.
Harben	PERSON	's ` Abner
Daniel	PERSON	, ' and wished to have further acquaint - ance with that shrewd rustic , have only to turn to ` The Georgians ' for the satisfaction of their desires .

		These books are of the sort that exist almost wholly for the sake of a single character , -- in the present case , for the sake of the story - telling busybody whose quaint humor saves every critical situation , and whose persuasive methods dissolve every difficulty .

		With Abner 's dialect stories eliminated , ` The Georgians ' would prove a thin enough performance , although there is sufficient pretence of connected plot to keep the book from absolute incoherency .

		The supply of Civil War stories shows no signs of giving out .

		One of the best of them is ` My Lady of the North , ' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	.

		As the title indicates , the heroine is a Federal sympathizer , which makes it obvious that the hero must be a Confederate .

		It would be a tame sort of romance that should forego the oppor - timities offered by this opposition for exciting adventure , generosity toward the adversary , and final union after the war is over .

		The scene of this novel is
Virginia	LOCATION	; the time the closing years of the confiict .

		It is all done upon the conven - tional pattern , and very well done .

		The senti - mental agony is prolonged by the device of leaving the hero to suppose that the heroine is the wife of his bitterest foe , when she is in reality only his sister-in-law and a widow .

		Sequels are proverbially dangerous things to attempt , but Mr.
George B. McCutcheon	PERSON	's `
Bev	PERSON	- erly of
Graustark	LOCATION	, ' which is a sequel to his first successful novel , has taken no great risks .

		Both books are absurd from every point of view except that of invention , and invention is about all the saving grace that is called for by the class of readers whose interest they enlist .

		In the new romance , we are again transported to the remote kingdom of
Graustark	LOCATION	, this time in the company of an American girl from
Washington	LOCATION	, whose words and ways give piquancy to the narrative ^ Most of the weirdly-named characters of the earlier work reappear , and the special senti - mental interest is provided by the girl
Beverly	LOCATION	and the brigand-prince Dantan who eventually comes to his own in both senses .

		It is a harm - less sort of book , capable of affording an hour of agreeable diversion .

		Mr.
Edward Mott Woolley	PERSON	's ` Roland of
Alten	PERSON	- burg ' is another romance of the ` Graustark ' sort , somewhat less prolific in invention , but con - forming more closely to the conventional type of this kind of artificial composition in matters of diction and stage-setting .

		It is a story that makes some pretence of taking itself seriously ; whereas Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's productions rather produce the impression of being innocent jokes at the reader 's expense .

		In this book ,
Prince Roland	ORGANIZATION	, travelling incognito in
America	LOCATION	, meets the young woman whom fate has destined to be his consort , and afterwards , when she is visiting
Altenburg	PERSON	and falls into danger , rescues her at some pergonal peril .

		This also is a harmless and mildly entertaining story .

		The sort of historical romance that has for its hero a long-suffering soldier of fortune , and that disports itself by preference in six - teenth-century
France	LOCATION	, is well illustrated by the ` Orrain ' of Mr.
S. Levett	PERSON	-
Yeats	PERSON	.

		The story con - cerns the rivalry of
Diane de Poitiers	ORGANIZATION	and the Queen , and the strife between Huguenots and Catholics .

		A Huguenot maiden is the heroine , and her love is the romantic prize of the narra - tive ; whUe her riches , coveted by
Diane	PERSON	, lead her into desperate dangers .

		It is needless to say that
Orrain	PERSON	is always there for her rescue in the nick of time .

		It is a little curious to find
Catharine de Medicis	PERSON	saving a Huguenot victim from the clutches of the church , but the Queen at this time was a different person from the Queen Mother of the year of the
Massacre	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Levett	PERSON	-
Yeats	PERSON	has a pretty trick of style and description ^ and knows how to construct an ingenious plot .

		Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	's new novel , ` Beatrice of
Venice	LOCATION	, ' has a subject of exceptional interest ^ and turns out to be a work of more ` body ' than most of the author 's previous inventions .

		It is a historical romance , dealing with the early stages of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's Italian campaign , and culminating with the horrors of the ' vespers of
Verona	LOCATION	, ' after which the occupation of
Venice	LOCATION	becomes a matter of course .

		The action is about evenly divided between
Venice	LOCATION	and
Verona	LOCATION	, and for the neces - sary pair of lovers we have on the one hand a trusted aide of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	, and on the other a great lady of
Venice	LOCATION	.

		The latter is enabled , at the risk of steps and positions that are danger - ously compromising , to soften the fate of the captured city , and thus vindicate the patriotism which has been questioned by many suspicious persons .

		The story abounds in dramatic action , and is altogether a very creditable example of the sort of romance which it exemplifies .

		Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	's ` Hearts in
Eaile	LOCATION	' tells the old melodramatic story of Russian tyranny , secret police , Siberian exile , and eventual escape ,
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	.

		313 but connects it with a plot of distinct novelty .

		Two men love the same woman , and she makes her choice .

		Afterwards both are exiled , her hus - band to the more remote and difficult region .

		The two meet on the journey to
Siberia	LOCATION	, and change names and destinations , thus giving the husband the better chance of escape .

		The wife , meanwhile , starts for
Siberia	LOCATION	to join her hus - band , and having reached her distant goal finds her rejected lover instead .

		The situation is diffi - cult , for she must pass for his wife , lest the exchange of names be discovered and both men put in jeopardy .

		Long afterwards , news comes of the death of her husband , and in due course of time she marries the other man , whom she has always secretly loved .

		But of course the hus - band is not dead , and of course he reappears when the mischief is done .

		So there is nothing for it but to dispose of him for good , after the agony has been sufficiently developed ; and this is done by having him shot when all three are escaping together .

		The author tells his story simply and directly , with much poignant force .

		As he himself says , the narrative ` deals with human emotions rather than with a too realistic detail of all the facts which excited them . '

		All of which means that the story is better than most of its class , although not to be compared with such powerful work as Mrs.
Voynich	PERSON	's `
Olive Latham	PERSON	, ' which it in some respects resem - bles .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	has added another to the lengthening series of his ingenious fantasies of mingled romance and scientific forecast .

		He calls it ` The Food of the Gods , ' and bases it upon the chemical preparation of a food-product that produces gigantic growth in every organism to which it is administered .

		When this product finds its way out of the laboratories of the invent - ors , startling consequences are entailed .

		To begin with , it produces gigantic chickens and rats and wasps , to say nothing of dangerous rank growths of vegetation .

		But its real mission is to produce a gigantic race of men and women ; and when a certain number of these creatures have been raised upon it , and grown to their mature stature of forty feet or thereabouts , civilization has to face a serious menace .

		These creatures are
Uebermenxchen	ORGANIZATION	in a more literal sense than that of which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	dreamed ; and as soon as they become conscious of their power , they have things pretty much their own way .

		The Food -LRB- properly call Boomfood -RRB- once started on its revolutionizing mission , all attempts to suppress it prove futile , and in the end there seems to be no outlook but extermination for ordinary old-fashioned mortals .

		It is a big con - ception , developed with much ingenuity of detail ; yet , with all his imagination , the author has only touched upon its possibilities here and there .

		There is not a little humor of the dry , satirical kind in the book , and here the author is at his best ; when he seeks to be magniloquent he achieves only bathos .

		One of the most important novels of the sea - son , and one of the strongest works of fiction that we have read for many a day , is Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	's '
Sabrina Warham	PERSON	. '

		Mr.
Housman	PERSON	takes his art very seriously , and most zealously avoids every species of claptrap and sensationalism .

		His style is both strong and finished , following approved conventional models rather than seeking to produce striking effects .

		The high seriousness of this work makes it almost sombre in coloring , for it is with the tragic deeps of life that the author chooses to deal , and he resorts sparingly to such elaborations of surface-detail as occupy the chief attention of nine out of ten contemporary novelists .

		Of his half-dozen or more leading characters , every one has the strength of distinct individuality .

		It may be the strength to maintain the citadel of one 's ideals against insurgent temptations , as in the case of
Sabrina	LOCATION	; it may be the strength to endure greatly with no outward manifestation of emotion , as in the case of
David	PERSON	, whom
Sabrina	PERSON	eventually marries .

		Again , it may be the strength of a character narrowly opinionated , as in the case of
Sabrina	LOCATION	's mother ; it may be the strength of a perverted and sour nature , as in the case of
David	PERSON	's father ; or it may be the strength of persistence in justifying an immoral course of conduct , as in the case of the man whom
Sabrina	PERSON	first marries and afterwards rejects when she discovers how he has deceived her .

		It is possibly chargeable to Mr ,
Housman	PERSON	as a fault , that each of these characters is too unmitigated in its exemplification of a particular theory of life , -- that all depart to some extent , in their rigidity of delineation , from the figures that actual life has to offer .

		We are not sure that this criticism is justifiable ; what we are sure of is that the figures in this book have so deep an impress of vital truth that they make shadows or puppets out of the figures in most other novels of the hour .

		In reading *
Sabrina Warham	PERSON	, ' we have been reminded more of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	than of any other novelist ; but it is hardly fair even to make a suggestion of this sort , so entirely is the work Mr.
Housman	PERSON	's own .

		By way of contrast , let us set beside the work just reviewed , the ' Double Harness ' of Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	.

		This is a very skilful piece of workmanship indeed , the product of a highly accomplished craftsman in letters ; yet it can not compare for a moment with the other in strength .

		It is not that it opposes the muse of romantic comedy to the muse of tragedy , for the one may inspire as profoundly as the other ; but it is rather that it has a movement too obvi - ously mechanical , a plan too obviously artifi - cial , to prove convincing .

		Here we have deline - ated with admirable cleverness the lives of three married couples , each of them starting out , no doubt , with the best of intentions , yet each in its own special way making a mess of the matrimo - nial experiment .

		The three are ingeniously differentiated , so that each makes an effective foil for the others , and all are brought into a network of inter-relations that gives a certain unity to the work as a whole .

		Moreover , Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's gift for phrase-making lends sparkle and animation to his every page But his characters leave no mark : they are not real in any natural 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	.

		sense ; if they are real in the sophisticated sense of modern English society , they prove that society rotten to the core , and thus unprofitable even for reproof .

		The author forgives his char - acters for their various sins -- ` Pardon 's the word for all , ' -- and would have his readers forgive them also , which is Christian and commendable .

		We do not think he expects us to admire them , save in one instance , and that is the instance of a man who , when his wife is about to desert her husband and child , forces her return by the threat -LRB- which we are given to understand is made in deadly earnest -RRB- that if she leaves him he will forthwith kill both himself and their infant child .

		This is a trifle too strong even for melodrama , and we can hardly hold such a char - acter at his creator 's estimate .

Mrs	PERSON	,
Sarah Pratt McLean Greene	PERSON	's latest book , is the story of an old-fashioned countryman of sufficient means , who takes his wife
Candace	PERSON	with him on a visit to the national capital and has there a series of humanizing experiences .

		The happy and contented couple are housed by chance in a shabby-genteel school for girls with a boarding - house attachment .

		The secrets of the household are sufficiently obvious , with all the petty shifts to maintain appearances on the part of the three maiden sisters at its head .

		One of the three pupils is kept from making a silly match by the good Deacon , and eventually the three school-mistresses are drafted off to a more comfortable career in the pleasant little town in which the good man lives .


Kentucky	LOCATION	, with its feuds , negroes , and whiskey , is the scene of Mr.
Opie Eead	PERSON	's ` Turk ' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story begins in the period just before the war , while the agitation for the abolition of slavery is going on , passing through that monumental strug - gle briefly , and bringing up somewhat abruptly with the hero in ownership of a fortune , all in gold coin , bequeathed him by a miser .

		The hero is a bound boy , the sole survivor of family welfare , and a well-drawn if somewhat unpleasant character .

		No small share of the narrative is given over to a discussion of the liquor evil , which includes a vivid delineation of the temptations suffered by one who has inherited a tendency to drink not wisely but too well .

		The book has more reserve and a better conception of plot than most of Mr.
Eead	PERSON	's books , and affords a convincing picture of the times .

		Mr.
Wilson Barrett	PERSON	's ` Never-Never Land ' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- is likely to make the reader * sit up ' -- to borrow one of its favorite phrases .

		It is a thorough-going old-fashioned Adelphi melodrama in book form , with incident enough for a whole ` nickel library ' between its two covers .

		It opens in the back country of
Australia	LOCATION	, with a bank robbery , a bush fire , a fatal accident , and a gang of villains using a dialect fearful and wonderful ; it traverses the
United States	LOCATION	, where people speak the variety of English usually put into the mouths of American characters on the British stage ; and it ends in merry
England	LOCATION	. '

		A Kittiwake of the Great Kills ' -LRB- The
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the collective title of twelve tales of living things , including birds , beasts , snails , crabs , and a tortoise , by Mr.
Charles Frederick Stansbury	PERSON	.

		They are all placid , interesting , and sympathetic , written from the point of view of an elder and wiser brother , and well calculated , if read , to put an end to the lack of consideration with which so many created things are viewed by thoughtless human beings .

		Especially to be commended is the reserve with which the deeds of smaller beings are set forth , avoiding over-drafts on one 's credulity in dealing with animal psychology .

		` More Cheerful Americans ' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is the name of Mr.
Charles Battell Loomis	PERSON	's volume of eighteen humorous tales , done in his familiar manner .

		They have little purpose except to amuse , although a couple of them verge upon the domain of crit - icism : ' The Song That Sold ' as showing what kind of music Americans can be persuaded to think they like , and ` How to Write a Novel for the Masses ' -- the latter so nearly true that one wonders why Mr.
Loomis	PERSON	does not follow his own prescription and amass wealth thereby .

		The manner in which millionaires from the new world can be taken in by unscrupulous venders of articles of vertu in the old gives Miss
Alice Jones	PERSON	the central idea about which ` Gabriel Praed 's Castle ' -LRB-

		Pacific Coast territory is fur - nished in
Sidona V. Johnson	PERSON	's ' Short History of
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
McClurg & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This rapid narra - tive touches briefly upon all the importaat epi - sodes -LRB- which are not few -RRB- in the historical life of the region once known as ` the
Oregon	LOCATION	coun - try , ' and which now embraces the states of Ore - gon ,
Washington	LOCATION	, and
Idaho	LOCATION	, with portions of adjacent states .

		Beginning with the sub-title of ` Discovery , ' the voyages of European sailors along the shores of the Pacific axe recounted , ending with the discovery by Captain Gray of the estuary of the
Columbia River	LOCATION	in
1792	DATE	, and his entrance upon its broad waters , and the sub - sequent acquaintance of the British seamen with this discovery , and their occupation of the shores of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	under the claim of priority .

		Wisely refraining from re-arguing a question now admitted to be settled in favor of the
United States	LOCATION	, the compiler cites the facts as to our prior occupation of the valley of the river , and the strained construction of the facts under which
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	affected to dispute our claim , which was long since admitted .

		The exploration of the territory is illustrated by a summary of the leading features of the well-known
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition ; following which , nearly half of the text is devoted to a more detailed history of the settlement of the
Oregon	LOCATION	country .

		The romantic story of the contest between two great Anglo-Saxon civilizations for the control of our empire on the
Pacific	LOCATION	is here related in a succinct and readable form .

		The labors and schemes of rival fur-trading companies , the com - peting plans for immigration and settlement , the quiet but often successful workings of the great companies in opposition to the introduction of immigrants for permanent occupation , the com - plications caused by the advent of missionaries of diverse creeds and their frequent clashes of opinion and influence , and the varying effects of these conflicting agencies upon the feeling and disposition of the native tribes , are here set forth as among the factors of a great international controversy ; though to each of these episodes , as to the narrative of the labors and exp > eriences of Dr.
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	, ending in the lament - able ` Whitman massacre , ' but little space can be allowed in this ` short history . '

		The work is a convenient compendium of the leading events in the period sketched , closing with an account of the final ending of ` the
Oregon	LOCATION	question , ' and the institution in the disputed country , first of territorial and afterward of state government according to the American model .

		From wilder - ness to metropolitan statehood was such a rapid course in this instance as to warrant its being recounted as history in these 315 pages .

		We are gi'owing accustomed to the plaint that the essay is dead , its place usurped by a new literary genre , the article of information written by the practical man and the specialist New essays ty Miss Repplier .

		for a public that is tired of fine-spun theories and demands facts -- when it is not occupied with fic - tion .

		We may be inclined to dispute the place of the practical man and his article in literature , but we are hardly in a position to deny the decadence , -- or , to speak more accurately , the gradual disappearance , -- of the essay .

		In Amer - ica at least it would be in a bad way , were it not for a little band of choice spirits few enough to be counted on one 's fingers , and numbering among their late recruits Dr.
Samuel Crothers	PERSON	, and among their leaders tried and true Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	.

		It is almost superfluous to attempt a review of Miss Repplier 's latest volume of essays , published under the title of ` Com - promises ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Most of these essays are already familiar to magazine readers ; and even if that were not the case , she has long since found her public , who need no critical t-anction to assure them that amid the snares and delusions of the book-mart Miss Repplier is of the few who may always be depended upon .

		The new ` Compromises ' are as clever and as delight - fully heretical as the older ` Points of View . '

		There is the same felicity of bookish allusion , the same keen-edged analysis , and the unfailing wit whereby Miss Repplier has done so much to enhance ` The Gayety of Life , ' to quote the title of one of these essays , and the luxury of litera - ture , to paraphrase another .

		As usual , she sweeps through a wide range of subjects .

		` Mar - riage in Fiction , ' ` Our Belief in Books , ' and ` The Luxury of Conversation ' are perhaps most characteristic .

		Another group of essays , includ - ing ` The Tourist , ' ` The Headsman , ' ` The Beg - gar 's Pouch , ' and ` The Pilgrim 's Staff , ' hint of recent European travel , some of them being the outgrowth of personal experience , and others clever bits of research along forgotten byways of history .

		There are plenty of people who do not care for Miss Repplier , -- who find her hard as well as brilliant , too allusive , too personal in her attitude to life , too critical of its commonplace dogmas .

		They generally end by saying that
Miss Repplier	PERSON	is a woman , and -- for reasons that vary with each disputant -- women can not write essays .

		Only time can settle the large issue , and ` Com - promises ' will not alter the party lines much .

		In ` Points of View , ' Miss Repplier reached her high-water mark , though one detects a slight gain in simplicity and mellowness in the more recent volumes .

		The real subject of the hand - book entitled ` The Apprecia - tion of Sculpture , ' from the pen of that accomplished critic Mr.
Russell Stur	PERSON	- gis and published by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is sculpture for sculpture 's sake .

		This is sound doctrine .

		In full acceptance of its point of view , and all that is implied by it , lies the true criterion for those who would learn to know and appre - ciate .

		A work of art should be valued for itself rather than for any moral lesson it may inculcate , or for the appeal , however subtle or impressive , that it may make to sentiment .

		The more pointed the lesson and the stronger the appeal , the more does it tend to divert attention from the artistic Appreciation of Sculpture .

		316 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, qualities of the work .

		To sculpture , because of its nature and limitations , this applies with especial force .

		If the sculptor be in truth an artist , his main thought and purpose must of necessity be aesthetic .

		Should enthusiasm for any associated idea sway him too far , his pro- ductions are sure to suffer by the substitution of thoughts foreign to his art as such .

		.

		Historic , religious , mythological , or literary :3 ignificances are all very well , and interest in them is not to be deprecated ; but they ai'e things quite distinct and apart from the artistic quality which is of first importance in works of art .

		By scattering such considerations through his book , instead of setting them forth at the outset , Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	avoids the semblance of preaching and aims to lead up to the right mental attitude rather than to formulate it .

		Yet somewhow , in spite of the truth of what he says , the manner of putting it is , on the whole , inconclusive .

		He begins by enumerating the existing works of sculpture that unquestionably are of the best epoch of Greek art , or have the characteristics of that epoch , and which constitute our best standard of excel - lence .

		The inquiry then proceeds , taking up the Greco-Roman works , those of
Europe	LOCATION	in the Mid - dle Ages , the Italian Revival and Decadence , and ending with several chapters on the sculpture of our own day .

		Eighty excellent and well-chosen illustrations serve to point the author 's remarks ,
Avhich	PERSON	are always intelligent and discriminating .

		Astronomy of the sentimental sort .


Camille Flammarion	PERSON	has a very considerable reputation as a writer on popular astron - omy .

		He understands the audience for which he writes , and his works have a large sale in
France	LOCATION	.

		But when his latest book is placed before the American public imder the title of ` Astronomy for Amateurs ' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , there is cause for pi'otest ; for the title of the French volume of which this is the authorized translation is ` Astronomy for Women , ' and the contents amply justify the title .

		Indeed , had the American title been ` Astronomy for French Women , ' it would have described the book more accurately .

		There are , however , at least two passages in the first hundred pages which a French or American mother of average discreetness would hesitate to read to her family of growing girls and boys .

		Such passages might be expected in the pages of a French novel , but there is no good excuse for inserting them in a book on astronomy .

		The gen - eral style of the book may be indicated by say - ing that the text is sentimental , fanciful , rhe - torically exuberant , at times inexact , and always readable by people who enjoy reading of that sort .

		The inexactness is sometimes due to the author 's endeavor to adapt his knowledge to the average feminine intellect , as he estimates it .

		Educated American women will resent the esti - mate .

		Most of the errors , however , were evi - dently ` made in
America	LOCATION	. '

		For example , the statement that the two moons of Mars were dis - covered by ` Mr.
Hall	PERSON	at
the University of Wash	ORGANIZATION	- ington , ' can scarcely have been made by a man so well posted as Flammarion ; his well-known antipathy to the
French National Observatory	ORGANIZATION	would hardly lead him to refuse to credit this capital discovery to the
U. S. Naval Observatory	ORGANIZATION	.

		As an illustration of the depths of sentimental - ism with which the author essays to charm the reader betimes , we quote from p. 192 , premising that ` Fig. 54 ' is a wood-cut which occupies nearly a page and represents a young girl looking at a stooting star .

		` The young girl dreaming in the delicious tranquility of the transparent night smiles at this charming sister in the Heavens -LRB- Fig. 54 -RRB- .

		What can not this adorable star announce to the tender and loving heart ?

		Is it the shy messenger of the happiness so long desired ?

		Its unpremeditated appearance fills the soul with a ray of hope and makes it tremble .

		It is a golden beam that glides into the heart , expanding it in the thrills of a sudden and ephemeral pleasure . '

		For a combination of irre - fragable logic and unimpeachable English , behold the following quotation from page 208 .

		The author is endeavoring to show how the earth is supported in space , without falling . '

		A body can only fall when it is attracted , drawn by a more important body .

		Now in whatever direction we may wander upon the globe , our feet are always downward .

		Down is therefore the center of the
Earth	LOCATION	, The terrestrial globe may be regarded as an immense ball of magnet , and its attraction holds us at its surface .

		We weigh toward the center ... This once understood , where could the
Earth	LOCATION	fall to ?

		The question is an absurdity .

		`` Below '' being toward the center , it would have to fall out of itself . '

		But why quote further ?

		The whole matter may be summed up by saying that the reader of this book is by turns enlight - ened , misled , bewildered , and amused .

		Familiar talks on country topics .

		Mr ,
William Potts	PERSON	, writing apparently as a resident , or
summer	DATE	resident , of Farming - ton ,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, loyally maintains that this pleasant and somewhat historic town has held in its day a place next only to
Rome	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	as a world centre ; and in that town the particular spot of chief interest and importance , to him at least , is very naturally his attractive home , which he has christened ' Underledge . '

		In ` More Notes from Underledge ' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , he chats genially with his readers , sometimes as a botanist or a meteorologist , sometimes as an antiquary , and again on whatever subject pops into his head , be it ` the passing of the pvunp ' or the hideous monstrosity of the so-called ` trolley . '

		The prime virtue of his little book is its frank and natural tone , which reveals the writer in his words and shows him to be a thoroughly companionable , communicative sort of person , with a merry mood that is not above quips and jests of even a very trivial kind .

		The style is indeed the man in his case , unless the reader is greatly deceived .

		From his chapter on ` Lamb 's Tales , ' which has noth - ing to do with its title , and but very little with sheep-raising , its ostensible theme , let us take , almost at random , a characteristic passage : ' A marsh is always an interesting place , especially to an artist , and also to one who is fond of wild -
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 317 flowers , for here he will find them in the great - est profusion and variety .

		And then what pos - sibilities of snakes are here , not to speak of musk - rats and other wild fowl ! '

		Again , speaking of his cellar drainage , he says : * It was a happy accident that the builder had been brought up in the school of that modern Greek who , what time there happened an unfortunate giving way in the `` bow of his boot , wisely made an equivalent aper - ture in the stern , so that the water which * * ran in at the toe ran immejetly out at the heel . ' ' '

		Chit - chat is not the highest form of literature , but who shall say it has not its uses ?

		Memoirs of leaders of the French Revolution There is a suggestion of invid - ious comparisons about the title ` The Great Frenchman and the Little Genevese ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which Lady
Seymour	PERSON	has chosen for her translation of
Etienne Dumont	PERSON	's ` Souvenirs sur Mirabeau . '

		Judged by the impression which his memoirs have left upon students of the Revolutionary period , and by the estimates of his character held by such men as Sir
Samuel Romilly	PERSON	,
Dumont	PERSON	was the opposite of ` little . '

		He had not only an unusually clear and s3Tnpathetic mind , -- he writes of his recollections with surprising candor .

		Many of the memoirs of the Revolution were composed during the Napoleonic period , or during the Restoration ; but what writer confesses , like
Dumont	PERSON	in
1799	DATE	, ` during the last ten years I have already forgotten many facts , and I fear that if I wait much longer my memory of them will become very confused , ' and ` as to the second part -LSB- the period after
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's death -RSB- I have still less to record , my recollections are very scat - tered and the sequence of them is often broken . '

		In this Avay he disclaims that restrospective omni - science which frequently misleads the reader of memoirs .

		His candor gives a pleasant conversa - tional tone to his recollections ; one feels that with so sane a guide one may see events and men as they would actually appear were we to step down into the streets of Revolutionary
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Dumont 's work concerns Mirabeau chiefly , but his descriptions of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, of Brissot ,
Cla	ORGANIZATION	- viere , and of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	, are almost equally interesting .

		` With them all he was on confidential terms .

		Lady
Seymour	PERSON	's translation is spirited , though not free from minor inaccuracies , includ - ing a mistake in the original title of the book .

		She is also in error when she says that hers is the first English translation of the ` Souvenirs , ' for an English translation was published in
1832	DATE	, Her work is none the less a service , because the earlier translation has long been practically unprocurable .

		Apropos of the beatitude with which Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	begins his delightful essay on
Hazlitt	PERSON	, ` Blessed is the man who enjoys himself , ' it is pertinent to respond , ' Blessed too is the man who enjoys the world around him . '

		And Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	himself , if indeed not the man , is at least one of the chief of such men .

		It is a great deal to say that his new book , ` Nature 's Invitation ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which , like its predeces - The invitations of Nature .

		sors , is a reprint from magazines and newspapers , is as good as his other writings .

		In truth , it is a little better , -- a little more perfect in its amalga - mation of life , literature , and nature , a little richer in its experience of birds and blossoms , men and mountains .

		It is wider , too , in geo - graphical range , recording visits to Mt. Wash - ington , the
Everglades	LOCATION	of
Florida	LOCATION	, and the deserts of
New Mexico	LOCATION	; but to ` the man with birds in his eye ' -- and other beautiful things , -- location is a mere incident . '

		The student of nature , ' Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	says , ` is never at a loss what to do with his day ' ; and never at a loss , moreover , to make the best of any situation in which he may be placed .

		A bleak trip up
Moosilauke	ORGANIZATION	in
May	DATE	is cheered for him by the discovery of
Selkirkii	LOCATION	, ` the one species of our
Eastern North American	ORGANIZATION	violets he has never picked ' ; the inanity of a
Florida	LOCATION	winter hotel is replaced by the excitement of identifying rare trees and shrubs in the ham - mock land near by ; even the tedium of a nine hours ' delay on the railroad is turned into an opportunity , for since ` the tourist 's mind , like his stomach , abhors a vacuum , ' he goes bird-hunting and has six new species to show for it .

		` Blessed are they who want something , for when they get it they will be glad , ' Especially blessed are they who want the beauties of the out-door world , and have gladness like Mr ,
Torrey	ORGANIZATION	's when they find them .

		All such will subscribe heartily to the naturalist 's creed , which is thus simply stated : ' Man was not made to see one kind of beauty , or to believe in one kind of goodness .

		The whole world is hid in his heart .

		All things are his .

		The small and the great , the near and the far , light and darkness , good and evil , the intimacies of home and the isolations of infinite space , all are parts of the Creator 's worls ; , and equally parts of the creature 's inheritance , ' A proffered Ii Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	's substitute for latest book , ` Where Does the creeds out-worn .

		Sky Begin ? '

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , there is gathered some of the ripest fruit of two or three years ' thinking and preaching .

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's congregation in
Columbus	LOCATION	are for - tunate in having been the first to hear the nine - teen discourses which compose this volume ; but aside from the sonorous delivery vhich com - mended them so favorably to the ear , there is enough meat and marrow in them , enough sanc - tified common-sense , to meet the tastes and the needs of the larger constituency throughout the country who have often been helped to clear thinking by the utterances of this vigorous preacher of righteousness .

		The practical prob - lems of the mind , and the Christian life as it can be lived even in this day and generation , are here discussed with unfailing freshness , only a sug - gestion of which may here be given by repeating some of the most striking titles , ` Moments and Movements , ' ` The Fulfillment of Life , ' ` Knowing How to be Rich , ' ` The Everlasting Yea , ' ` The Education of Our Wants , ' ` How to be Sure of God , ' ` The Lesson of the Cross , ' are captions Avhich will appeal not in vain to a wide range of thoughtful readers .

		Not much of the ` old 318 THE DIAL .

		-LSB- Nov , 16 , theology ' is to be found in these pages , even as an object of denunciation ; the polemics of other days have been succeeded by the glow and enthu - siasm of a constructive Christianity that feels the obligation resting upon it to replace the out -
Avorn	PERSON	creeds by a living and working faith .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The new `
Gladstone	PERSON	' edition of Eossetti gives us in a single volume the complete poetical works , with full index and other editorial equipment .

		It follows the text of Mr.
W. M. Eossetti	PERSON	's authorized edition , and has the introduction written by him nearly twenty years ago .

		It is published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` With the publication of Volume IV .

		of ` The Spanish Conquest in
America	LOCATION	, ' by Sir
Arthur Helps	PERSON	, Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	has completed his handsome reprint of this important work .

		His share of the undertaking as publisher leaves nothing to be desired , and ■ the editorial part of the work , as performed by Mr.
M. Oppenheim	PERSON	, is also highly satisfactory .

		Messrs ,

		This is the first book of a series planned by Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	for the purpose of vivifying the lives and times of the great Eng - lish writers .

		The book is incidentally a biography , but essentially a picture of life in an age long past , and now described for us in simple and attractive language .

		` The Art of Caricature ' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Grant White	PERSON	, is a text-book intended to provide its readers with a foundation upon which to build an art education .

		The information given has not , for the most part , appeared in printed form elsewhere , and the author has of course kept the needs of the beginner constantly in mind .

		As a book of instruction , it supplies technical knowl - edge that will appeal to the embryo artist , and the illustrations accompanying the chapters on expres - sion , color , technique , composition , etc. , are of such a nature as to furnish a fundamental idea of the general requirements of the art in question .

		The ` Oxford Modern French Series , ' edited by Mr.
Leon Delbos	PERSON	, is a collection of texts , provided with introductions and notes , and published by Mr.

		2 volumes , 8vo , cloth , ^ ^ .00 net .

		IN this book , Professor Vamb ^ ry , than whom no Hungarian is better known to the English-speaking world , gives a full and detailed account of all the vicissitudes of his career .

		His life has been , indeed , an extraordinarily romantic one .

		Fatherless , lame , and almost penniless , he was compelled , when a mere child , to shift for himself , and up to the age of eighteen his life was a constant struggle against starvation .

		Yet by the time he had reached his twentieth year he had become one of the most accomplished linguists in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Vamb ^ ry 's most famous feat was his great journey through
Central Asia	LOCATION	.

		For this he adopted the dress of a Dervish , and traveled to
Khiva	LOCATION	with a herd of fanatics , who , had they discovered him , would have torn him to pieces .

		He visited
Bokhara	LOCATION	,
Samarkand	LOCATION	, and all the Oxus country in complete safety .

		Few men have been so closely connected with leading men and women as has Vamb ^ ry .

		His personal friendship for the last three Sultans of
Turkey	LOCATION	and the last two Shahs of
Persia	LOCATION	is as much a matter of notoriety as the high respect in which he was held by the late Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, a respect which is fully shared by her son .

		NOTES .385 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 38 '' THE AGE OF R EPRINT .

		Four yards of
Thackeray	PERSON	, roughly measured , , just now standing on the editorial desk , prompt us to a few reflections , apposite enough at any time of the year , and peculiarly seasonable at this time of the approaching holidays .

		It appears to be
Thackeray	PERSON	in the present instance ; .

		it mdght just as well be Shakespeare or Seott or
Dickens	PERSON	or
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		These huge boxes of old books in new editions are among the most familiar of our visitors , yet their appearance is an unfailing cause of wonder , and of amusedl 360 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, speculatian concerning - their presumable pur - chasers and readers .

		That they find purchasers is clear enough ; they would not come to us in such seemingly endless procession except in response to a corresponding demand .

		Con - sidered as articles of commerce , they are
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently sure of their market .

		Carlyle is as staple a product as corn or cotton ;
Thackeray	PERSON	is no less steady an object of consumption than tobacco or tea .

		The publisher of these editions takes no more risk than the farmer who raises his crop ; Ms product is subject to the usual market fluctuations , but is reasonably assured of yielding a return of the cost of production .

		The output , moreover , increases from year to year with the increase of population , just as the production of wheat increases , thus verifying the saying that man shall not live by bread alone .

		Pursuing still further the economic analogy , many other facts may be noted concerning this branch of manufacturing industry .

		Applica - tion of the principle of division of labor is so `` thoroughgoing , and use of labor-saving machin - • ery is so general , that cost is reduced to an ; astonishingly low figure , and even this minimum tends constantly toward a lower point .

		The economic gain resulting from large produc - tion is realized to the full , and indications of trust metho ` ds of controlling the market have been noticeable of recent years .

		Pressure is put upon retailers who show a tendency to cut prices or offer secret rebates , and we even have the phenomenon of editions for export offered at lower prices than these made to supply the home market .

		Shipping our American-made Shakespeares and Scotts to
London	LOCATION	, for the purpose of underselling the products of the pauper printers of
England	LOCATION	, is a veritable send - ing of coals to
Newcastle	LOCATION	, but why should we not do with reading-matter what we have so successfully learned to do with steel rails ?

		Even the more recondite regions of economic theory may be illustrated by literature in its commercial aspect ; we find exemplified the law of diminishing returns when we turn from
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	to the exploita - tion of less popular authors , and the pub - lisher is confronted with the farmer 's old problem of choice between intensive and exten - sive cultivation .

		Finally , we may suggest that in offering to the public its favorite authors in a great variety of editions , many a purchaser , succumbing to temptation , becomes the owner of two or three Carlyles or Macaulays or Shakespeares , thereby illustrating the doc - trine of marginal utility and cheapening to the level of cost what should be the most priceless of possessions .

		It is not denying the patent fact that new books are now being written in greater num - bers than ever to assert that the present age is an age of reprint .

		Of the new books we have here nothing to say , because our present con - cern is with the extraordinary multiplication of the old ones , a multiplication without parallel in the past .

		It takes every conceivable form and is made upon every imaginable pretext .

		An extensive collection of sets of standard authors may result from the invention of a new quality of paper , or a new device in binding , or a new idea about methods of bookselling .

		An original taste for decorative effect may make the future of a whole library of literature .

		The talent of some new illustrator may require the production of a long series of editions whose only raison d'etre is the exercise of that par - ticular talent upon the text .

		The individuality of some neat or brilliant critic may make imperative many rows of reprints brought into existence solely that he may be their editor .

		An unanswerable argument for a new edition is always offered by the unearthing of material hitherto omitted .

		` Victor and
Cazire	PERSON	' is brought to light , and straightway there must be a new edition of the whole of Shelley .

		A few fragments of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	or
Poe	PERSON	or
Thackeray	PERSON	are ferretted out from the files of ancient newspapers , and create a crying need for new editions of those writers .

		A batch of letters is unearthed , and at once all the old edi - tions of the author who wrote them must give way to the new edition which shall include these letters also .

		It does not matter how trivial or even worthless these acquisitions are ; they afford a sufficient pretext for an up-to-date canon .

		Sometimes , through excess of zeal , the new matter ascribed to an author is afterwards proved not to have ` been written by him , and then there must be still another new edition which shall leave it out .

		How skilfully editors and publishers work upon their victims to persuade them that they really must buy these new editions , or be consigned to the outer dark - ness wherein grope those bibliophiles who shirk their responsibilities , is well known to all who have ever given a thought to the psychology of the bookish public .

		All this passion for accuracy and completeness is in a general way commendable , yet it becomes somewhat ridiculous when it is expended upon authors of the second or third class .

		And in any case it proves a severe strain upon the resources of scholars , who are about the only persons to whom textual integrity really mat - ters .

		One unfortunate result of the artificial appetite for ' sets ' of the authors is the oppor - tunity offered unscrupulous publishers to prey upon an uncritical public .

		Here the ' subscrip - tion ' publisher finds his opportunity , and he
1904	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 361 maJces the most of it .

		His wares are of a sort that intelligent and scholarly readers reject by instinct , but he knows better than to make his appeal to them , or to seek to dispose of his editions through the natural trade channels .

		He aims instead at the unwary rich , and they fall his victims in surprising numbers .

		His editions are apt to be ^ faked , ' they are tricked out with showy illustrative material , they are provided with a vulgar and pretentious dress , and the smooth-tongued canvasser is trusted to work them off .

		They are sold for two or three times their cost , and their publisher flourishes at the expense of gullible book-buyers who rarely learn how shrewdly they have been imposed upon .

		Of course , there are occasion - ally offered ' subscription sets ' that are con - scientiously made and in every way desirable , but such are the exception rather than the rule .

		In most cases the edition that is marketed upon this plan is one that a discriminating book - man would not put upon his shelves at any price .

		Such publications are designed for ignorant purchasers of the affluent class ; for buyers of limited means a counterpart is offered by the editions manufactured for the special needs of the dry goods trade , the department store , and the popular auction-room .

		These objects have the appearance of books , but they offer an affront to every bookish sense .

		They illustrate the extreme of cheapness in every detail ; they are printed from worn plates with bad ink upon coarse paper that will soon turn yellow and rot ; their binding is muslin of the flimsiest , or of leather that will crumble at a touch after a few years .

		And how curiously restricted is their range !

		The same popular novelists , the same old-fashioned historians , and the same democratic assembly of poets greet us in one shop after another , offered at bargain prices , and passed over the counters by salespeople who know nothing of their contents and to whom they are merely so much merchandise .

		Truly , the public is beset by a plague of books of this sort , and literature is hopelessly vulgarized by the indignity thus done to it .

		Upon another occasion , we propose to ask what becomes of all the books thus cheaply and excessively multiplied , and to inquire whether this age of reprint is correspondingly an age of advanced culture .

		It is announced that ` The
Burlington	LOCATION	Magazine ' will hereafter be published in this country by Mr.
Robert Grier Cooke	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		By the authori - tative character of its text and the beauty of its external form , the `
Burlington	LOCATION	' has achieved an enviable position among the world 's art period - icals .

		Under the new management it should find its way to a large circle of American connoisseurs .

		^ \ t i ^ to go0ks .

		A Later ` Old
Pepys	PERSON	. '

		* The descendants of Mr.
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	can hardly be expected to regard his literary career with unalloyed satisfaction .

		From an imper - sonal point of view it is easy to condone his many faults , and impossible not to enjoy his vivacious memorial of them ; but as an ancestor he certainly lacks dignity .

		The simplicity and pettiness to which he owes his fame may repre - sent a type of genius , and the famous Diary is undoubtedly unique in literature ; but as a family heirloom it has its obvious disad - vantages , which we can not expect the
Pepys	PERSON	family to ignore .

		It is only natural for the more serious-minded members of this family to wish , now and then , that the too garrulous chronicles had remained in the decent obscurity of short-hand , and that it had been left to some more decorous
Pepys	PERSON	to immortalize the family name .

		To this serious-minded faction belongs Miss
Alice C. C. Gaussen	PERSON	, a descendant from a collateral branch of the
Pepys	PERSON	family ; and she has undertaken to bring it about that the redoubtable Samuel shall not be the only
Pepys	PERSON	known to fame .

		Miss Gaussen is willing , even anxious , to give
Samuel	PERSON	his due .

		She can not enjoy the ignominious self-revelation of his Diary , but as a faithful record of the century in which he lived she admits its charm .

		She reminds us , too , quoting
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	for the purpose , that
Pepys	PERSON	's public career was wholly to his honor , and that , in sharp contrast to the ' indecent familiarity ' with which his name is now bandied about , he was looked upon by his own generation with distant respect and even awe .

		King
James	PERSON	had such regard for him that he would not let even so momentous an event as the landing of
William	LOCATION	interrupt his sitting for a portrait which he intended as a present for
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	: a touching tribute , surely !

		How proud might the
Pepys	PERSON	family be of
Samuel	LOCATION	, if he had not yielded to temptation and kept a diary !

		But Miss Gaussen hastens to assure us that there is another
Pepys	PERSON	-- ' A Later
Pepys	PERSON	, ' for so her title distinguishes him , -- about whom no such reservations are necessary - .

		The private life of this ' later
Pepys	PERSON	' was as delightful as his public career was honorable ; sharing his kinsman 's ' faculty of revealing his ever -RCB- ' thought , ' he was unlike that kinsman in ' pos - sessing a mind that could afford to think aloud . '

		* A Later
Pepys	PERSON	.

		The Correspondence of Sir William W ^ eller
Pepys	PERSON	,
Bart.	LOCATION	, Master in
Chancery	LOCATION	, 1758-1829 .

		Edited by
Alice C. C. Gaussen	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .

		Illus - trated .

		New York :
John Lane	PERSON	.

		362 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Sir
William Weller Pepys	PERSON	, this later and more estimable representative of the family , was born in
1740	DATE	and died in
1825	DATE	, the very year of the publication of the unfortunat -LRB- 3 Diary .

		He was , we are told , a Master in Chan - cery ; but it is more to the purpose that he was also a wit and a famous conversationalist in the days when the ' Bas Bleu ' flourished and conversation was still an art .

		Bos well desig - nated him as being ' well known in polite cir - cles . '

		The great
Johnson	PERSON	assured Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	that he should have liked
Pepys	PERSON	better if she had praised him less , and more than once ran amuck of his literary tastes or his Whig prin - ciples .

		It was
Johnson	PERSON	, too , who dubbed Mrs.
Montague	PERSON	` queen of the blues , ' and
William Pepys	PERSON	her ' prime minister . '

		Fanny Bumey 's Memoirs contain many a pleasant reference to him , bearing witness to his ' fashionable air , dress and address , '' to which ` he added great shrewdness and drollery ' ; and to the success of his '
Bas Bleu	PERSON	' assemblies , whose groups were ' less awful than at Mrs.
Montague	PERSON	's , and less awkward than at Mrs.
Vesey	PERSON	's . '

		Hannah More even goes so far as to call him the ' chief orna - ment ' of the select society of wits and scholars of his time .


Horace Walpole	PERSON	offers the char - acteristic bit of information that Sir
William	PERSON	's nose was ' as long as himself . '

		Such comments as these , contained in
Miss Gaussen	LOCATION	's initial sketch of Sir
William	PERSON	's life , stimulate interest .

		So do the other introduc - tory chapters with their anecdotes of the blue - stocking parties and some of the leading ` Blues , ' their account -LRB- from
Fanny Bumey	ORGANIZATION	's diary -RRB- of a series of gallant battles between
Johnson	PERSON	and
William Pepys	PERSON	, and their descrip - tions of the ways of the wits at Bath and Tun - bridge Wells , and of the dress , manners , and literary standards of polite society in
William Pepys	LOCATION	's day .

		The best society of the eighteenth century may not have been any better than that of other centuries , but it was certainly more fortunate in its chroniclers .


Fanny Burney	PERSON	,
Boswell	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	have been often drawn upon , but their resources have never been exhausted ; and
Miss Gaussen	PERSON	's point of view enables her to present well-known mate - rial in a fresh light , as well as to add a good deal that is intrinsically new .

		Sir
William	PERSON	is not exactly the central figure in these chapters , but he is the point of departure .

		When we have finished them we have placed him in the familiar Johnsonese background , -- have met his friends and heard their tributes to his probity , benevolence , and classical learning , his kindly heart and cultivated memory , his ani - mated talk and his charming letters .

		For it was to letter-writing that this second
Pepys	PERSON	devoted his literary energies .

		He had nothing to conceal in a short-hand journal .

		He medi - tated playing
Boswell	PERSON	to some of his illustrious friends , but he never did -- we can easily see why .

		Instead , he turned to letter-writing , unfailing resource of all gentlemanly scrib - blers ; and there is evidence to show that like his friend
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, ' prince of letter - writers , ' he intended some of them at least for a wider audience than the individual recipient .

		It is of letters that Sir
William Pepys	PERSON	wrote , together with some that he received , that the bulk of Miss
Gaussen	PERSON	's two thick volumes are made up .

		Of Sir
William	PERSON	's own letters there are three groups : a Chesterfieldian series , written when he was still young , to a younger cousin at
Oxford	LOCATION	; a few dated twelve years later , to hiS ' eldest son ; and a big batch , written during a. platonic friendship of forty years ' standing , to -
Hannah More	PERSON	.

		It may as well be admitted first as last that Sir
William	PERSON	's letters are not so amusing as we had hoped .

		To use one of hi * own favorite aidjectives , they are a little too > ' blue ' for modem taste .

		The first group is decidedly pedantic .

		Like
Lord Chesterfield	LOCATION	, Sir
William	PERSON	wished his young friend to turn out ' an amiable and conversible Man in Society , as well as a dis - tinguished Character in publick , ' and he regarded an industrious attention to ' the Ideas of the best writers , ' particularly of the best classical writers , as the certain means to that end .

		We admire his optimism and his latinity ; but we can not help sympathizing a little with his young cousin 's tardiness in responding t < > his kinsman 's lengthy epistles , and his reluct - ance to give a full account in writing of all the passages in the Iliad that ` struck him the - most . '

		It is pleasant to find that after twenty years ' experience of life Sir
William	PERSON	's educa - tional theories are far less dogmatic .

		Or perhaps it is only because his eldest son is a delicate boy , that he writes him simple little notes , full of fatherly wishes for his happiness , and instead of urging him to apply himself to the classics , bids him remember that no honor of scholar - ship is half so valuable as a contented mind in a sound body .

		The letters to Mrs.
Hannah More	PERSON	are natur - ally the best of the three series , refiecting much more of Sir
William	PERSON	's personality , and a little more of the life of the time .

		One can imagine that a platonic friendship with Mrs. More would be a pleasant , prosy , serious affair ; and the letters that record its progress are of the same type , -- pleasant , prosy , meditative , and very loug-winded .

		It is a pity that Miss Gaussen could not have hunted up one of her ancestor 's notes to Fanny Bumey , -- he must have written some , -- or to
Horace Walpole	PERSON	.

		For the great charm of the eighteenth century lies in its ironic juxtapositions , -- its bizarre
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 363 mingling of the elephantine and the trifling , its odd fashion of toying with the one and learn - edly expounding the other .

		Without its John - son , its
Burke	PERSON	, and its blue-stocking ladies , it would have been a vapid farce ; without its humorists , its gossips , and its busy-bodies , we should know very little about it nowadays , -- and care less .

		Unfortunatel -RCB- ^ , Sir
William	PERSON	's letters belong to the ponderous eighteenth cen - tury type .

		In spite of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's cavalier treat - ment of him , he persisted in admiring
Johnson	PERSON	, and his letters have more in common with ' The Vanity of Human Wishes ' than with
Walpole	LOCATION	's elegant affectations or
Fanny Bumey	ORGANIZATION	's lively chronicles .

		Sir William never gossips , and sel - dom descends to anecdote ; he reflects and expounds , theorizes and comments .

		It is all very elevating ; we can quite understand his correspondents ' pleasure in hearing from him , but we do not reproduce it .

		On the whole , the letters written to Sir
Wil	PERSON	- liam are more interesting than those he wrote .

		JNTathaniel
Wraxall	PERSON	is the spiciest and most irre - sponsible of his correspondents .

		Major Rennell , the great geographer , pouring an encyclopaedic fund of information into the ears of his delighted hearer , is another decided and very genial personality .

		Sir
Lucas Pepys	PERSON	, doing the grand tour , writes home conscientious accounts of his journeyings .

		Mrs.
Chapone	PERSON	, in the role of elderly mentor , advises her young friend in love and begs his assistance in poetry .

		There is a budget from the love-lorn Mrs.
Hartley	PERSON	of Bath , and more sketches of travel from young
James Macdonald	PERSON	, whose brother
Alexander	PERSON	had such ill luck in entertaining
Johnson	PERSON	during his tour of the Hebrides .

		There are too many of the letters ; none but zealous antiquaries will care to peruse them all .

		The cynic will search through them in vain for any hints of mental kinship with
Samuel	PERSON	.

		The general reader , skipping judiciously here and there , will meet old friends in plenty and make new ones as he goes .

		Hereafter they will all associate the name of
Pepys	PERSON	with a scholar and a gentleman of the old school , -- a man of striking worth and exemplary conduct ; not , indeed , a genius who vn-ote a damaging master - piece by chance , but a staid and pleasant friend and an irreproachable ancestor .


Edith Kellogg Dunton	PERSON	.

		A pocket series of French classics in the original text , well printed and bound but inexpensive in price , will be inaugurated this month by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The series will be known as ` Les Classiques Fran § aises , ' and the first book to be issued will be Octave Feuillet 's ' Le Eoman d ` un Jeune Homme Pauvre , ' with a preface by
M. Ferdi	PERSON	- nand Bruneti ^ re .

		Other early volumes will be
Meri	PERSON	- m ^ e 's ` Colomba , ' George Sand 's * La Mare au Dia - blo , ' and Sainte-Beuve 's ` Essais , ' each with a preface by an Academician .

		Eakly Maps of
America	LOCATION	.

		* It is just seventy years since
Alexander voO Humboldt	PERSON	published , in the first edition of hi - * Exam en Critique , his discovery that the name
America	LOCATION	was given to the new world at the sug - gestion of a forgotten G-erman geographer by the name of
Martin Waldseemiiller	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one place Waldseemiiller wrote , ' In the sixth climate toward the south pole are situaited both the farthest part of
Africa	LOCATION	recently discovered ... and the fourth part of the globe , which , since
Americus	LOCATION	discovered it , may be called Amerige , that is the land of
Americus	LOCATION	or Amer - ica ' ; and in another place he said , * Now truly , since a fourth part of the world has been dis - covered by Americus Vespucius , I do not see why Ave may not rightly caU it Amerige , that is the land of
Americus	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	. '

		These passages occur in his Cosmographiae Introduc - tion printed in
1507	DATE	at
St. Die	ORGANIZATION	in
Lorraine	LOCATION	, in which a letter of Vespucius , describing four voyages to the new world , was printed as an ap - pendix .

		The sub-title of the book reads , ' A de - scription of an universal cosmography , both in solid and in plane , in which there have been in - serted the things , unknown to
Ptolemy	LOCATION	, which have recently been discovered . '

		From this sub - title , and from further references in the dedica - tion and the text , it is clear that the book was intended to accompany a globe and a map of the world .

		For some thirty years cartographers have known a single copy of a set of gores , formerly belonging to
General Hauslab	ORGANIZATION	, in which
South America	LOCATION	bears the name
America	LOCATION	, and some have supposed that they were the work of Waldseemiiller .

		But no trace of the map of the world had ever been found , until it was discovered three years ago , by Father
Joseph Fischer	PERSON	, Professor of Geography in the Jesuit college at
Feldkirch	ORGANIZATION	in the
Tyrol	LOCATION	.

		The map was found in the library of Prince
Wald	PERSON	- berg , at his castle of Wolfegg , in southern ' Wiirtemberg .

		Together with the map of
1507	DATE	^ there was also found a marine chart made bj Waldseemiiller in
1516	DATE	, the existence of which had scarcely been suspected , though some such chart was listed in
1570	DATE	in the catalogue of Ortelius .

		But slight account of these discov - eries was given at the time , Professor
Fischer	PERSON	preferring to postpone a description of the maps until their publication in exact fac-simile .

		In editing them , he has had the assistance of Profes - sor von
Wieser	PERSON	of the
University of Innsbruck	ORGANIZATION	; and their recent issue is an important contribu - tion to the history of cartography and the his - tory of
America	LOCATION	.

		Its name is the

		There is no mention of the other planets .

		... I am in a position to say to these men and women , and do say , write to me and I will assist you in learning anything you desire to know .

		I am in a position to say this without qualification .

		There is no department of knowledge which can not be taught , and I am prepared to demonstrate that anj ^ department of knowledge which can be taught , can be taught by mail .

		We shall , therefore , teach everything which is teachable .

		For this reason our institution is called a
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is universal in its function as a teacher .

		It embraces everything .

		It omits nothing .

		An undertaking the like of which has never heretofore been attempted in the history of the world .

		... I believe that the methods that prevail in many schools , colleges and univer - sities are antiquated and old-fashioned ...
This University	ORGANIZATION	gives just as thorough an education as any school , college or university in the world .

		but it is stripped of all unnecessary hampering by method . '

		Where is to be found the faculty who will thus dispense all wisdom ?

		We turn the pages with bated breath , fearing to learn that the professors of
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	have seceded in a body and are now on their way to
Washington	LOCATION	.

		But not so ; the faculties of those places are fossilised , anyway , and would be quite unsuited for the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	' The Faculty of the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	is divided into two groups -- the
Eegular Faculty	ORGANIZATION	and the Advisory Faculty .

		Space does not permit me to tell you about all of the various
Deans	PERSON	, Professors , Text - writers , Instructors , etc. .

		It is sufiicient to state that I have placed at the head of these Faculties two of the ablest and most efficient educators in the world . '

		We then learn that Dr.
J. F. Crowell	PERSON	is Edu - cational Director , and Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	is Chainnan of the
Advisory Faculty	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not another member of the numerous faculties is mentioned . '

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, ' -- the name sounds familiar ; oh yes , to be sure : '
William Torrey Harris	PERSON	, LL .

		D. , ^ ^ is recognized throughout the civilized globe as one of the fore - most educators of any age .

		Thousands call him the greatest living philosopher ; Americans call him the Chief of the greatest Educational system , and all recognize in him a tremendous power for good .

		Not on account of these things , but because of his true worth as a scholar , a thinker and a man -- did we choose him as the Chairman of our Advisory Fac - ulty . '

		And a foot note : ' ^ - As you know , the public school system of the
United States	LOCATION	is the best in the world .

		It has over fifteen million students , and over four hundred and thirty thousand teachers .

		The annual expenditure is over two hundred and
twenty-six million dollars	MONEY	, of which the teachers receive one hundred and
forty-two million dollars	MONEY	in annual salaries .

		The Chairman of our Advisory Faculty , Hon.
William Torrey Harris	PERSON	, has been for fifteen years , and is now , at the head of this great system . '

		It is not explicitly stated that the said system will be annexed to the
I. C. U	ORGANIZATION	.

		The president also sends a typwrittten letter .

		As it is manifestly of a circular nature , and was in reply to a perfectly bald request for the pamphlet , it may be permissible to quote : ' My dear Mr.
Cockerell	PERSON	: ' I take great pleasure in complying with your request .

		... I hope that you will carefully fol - low the little '' heart to heart '' talk contained in the ' ' statement , ' ' and let me know what you think of it ... There are doubtless some things it leaves unexplained ... The chief aim in life is progress .

		THE DIAL 265 quoted all the above for the sake of mere hilarity .

		It is a serious matter for this country that it should be possible for a body of men of undoubted high ability and wide reputation to put forth such a scheme , heralded in such a manner .

		To me , it seems from beginning to end in the most wretched taste ; yet it can not SO ' seem to the promoters , who are no innocents from an unswept comer of the world .

		Probably it will seem all right to a large section of the public .

		If I am wrong , may I be forgiven ; but frankly , I should despair of a nation to wthich the prospectus of the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	appeared a fit and natural thing .

		Setting aside the ques - tion of taste , it appears to me to be nonsense .

		Every scientific man believes in the correspon - dence method , conducts a correspondence school himself .

		I have nothing against the method in reason ; but to advance the view that education by correspondence is a fit substitute for per - sonal contact is a totally different matter .

		It is the result of a mechanical conception of edu - cation which is the natural and hateful product of a commerciail age .

		Moreover , even if it were possible to teach as well through the mails as any other way , where is the faculty to come from ?

		Money will not multiply the really first class men in the country , and what is more , such men will not follow the methods of the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	, which would be extremely wasteful of their time and energy .

		It is all very well to be a trustee or the chairman of a faculty , but it is not without reason that we hear nothing about the names of the actual teachers .

		Prob - ably the faculties will really contain some well - known names , but of necessity the work of teaching , where ` You may start at any time .

		There are no regular classes ; you will be in a class by yourself will have to be turned over to the mules of the profession .

		There is undoubtedly a useful field for a cor - respondence-school in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		A body of reasonably competent men , able to consult the national libraries and collections and extract desired information therefrom , would be very serviceable .

		A great amount of such work is done by the Government Bureaus , and I think very properly and usefully ; but it might very well be supplemented by an institution charging fees for work not properly within the scope of the government , or too extensive for it to under - take .

		I formerly hoped that the
Carnegie Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution might do this sort of work , andl if the
I. C. U.	ORGANIZATION	can settle down to this or any other reasonable field of activity we may be duly thankful .

		If it can then find a more acceptable name , we may even come to regard it with affection : -- but it was asked of old , how shall the leopard change his spots ?

		We have the great work of
Parton	LOCATION	, written more than a generation ago ; the hostile study of Professor
Sumner	PERSON	, who condemned almost everything that
Jackson	PERSON	favored , while he appreciated the quality of his manhood ; the appreciative sketch of Mr.
W. GT	PERSON	.

		Brown ; and the studies of
Jackson	LOCATION	to be found in the his - tories of the times .

		Still there is room for a new study of this remarkable man from the point of view of today , and the greatness of his influence upon the development of our institu - tions and our political life would seem to demand it .

		Mr.
Buell	PERSON	, who did not live to see his book in print , has written with enthusiasm for his subject , and has put into the work a great amount of labor ; but he can hardly be said to have met the demand for a modern life of
Jack	PERSON	- son .

		His letters show that from the reading of his first book at the age of seven years , -- Judge
Alexander Walker	PERSON	's `
Jackson	PERSON	and
New Orleans	LOCATION	' , ' -- when his imagination and his interest were captured , the personality and achievements of General
Jackson	PERSON	have been a life-study with Mr.
Buell	PERSON	, and that he has not only read everything in print or manuscript that he could find concerning him , but that an even more important part of his preparation for writing this book were personal interviews with many of those who had known General
Jackson	PERSON	as friends and acquaintances ; and some of these interviews bring out the personality of the subject most vividly .

		The book is very interesting , for Mr.
Buell	PERSON	's long experience in newspaper work has taught him how to tell a story well , and the career of
Jackson	PERSON	furnishes material that even a poor writer could hardly make uninteresting .

		But with all his facility as a writer , and his study and loving care in working out the story of
Jackson	PERSON	's life , he fails through lack of judicial fairness to make a biography which shall satisfy the thoughtful student of our national life .

		While he seems to try to be fair , he has adopted many of
Jackson	PERSON	's own prejudices , and the book fails to ring true for this reason .

		And to some of these prejudices he gives expression so often that the reader loses sympathy with him in his narrative .

		One of these prejudices is that * History of

		More than that , the book expressly restricted the name to the southernmost part of the southern continent .

		Upon the map the name was placed upon the same part of the conti - nent ; but , being the only general name upon the continent , it was naturally taken , in the absence of other names and of the restrictions in the text , to apply to the whole .

		With this understanding it was copied in other maps and globes , and especially in the globes made by
Schoner	PERSON	.

		It was
Schoner	PERSON	who in
1533	DATE	made the first suggestion , in his Opusculuw ,
Geographicum	PERSON	, that
Vespucius	PERSON	was himself instrumental in applying his own name to the new world ; but it is not always noted that he nevertheless retained the name
America	LOCATION	upon the globe that accompanied this tract .

		In his cordiform map of
1538	DATE	, and in his globe gores of
1541	DATE	,
Mercator	ORGANIZATION	completed the work by extending the name
America	LOCATION	to both continents .

		But for the influence of the map of
1507	DATE	, the suggestion of the Cosmographice Iritroductio would probably have produced slight effect .

		The present maps are doubtless as important in their relation to the cartography of the old world as to that of the new ; but it is only the latter relation that can be here noted .

		A full appreciation of their content and import must necessarily be the work of some years .

		Their discovery and publication may give a new impulse to the study of cartography .

		It can never be too strongly insisted that history must always be studied in the light of contemporary maps ; and especially is this true of the period of discovery , when it is more important for the understanding of contemporary thought to know what it was supposed had been found than it is to know w ` hat had really been found .

		This subject has been neglected in the
United States	LOCATION	, but it is to be hoped that sufficient atten - tion will be given it in time to come to render it possible to construct an atlas of American history that is worthy of the name .

		The maps have been issued by the publishers in three forms : in sheets in a portfolio , in a volume bound uniformly with Nordenskiold ^ ts atlases , and as wall-maps .

		The bound volume is most convenient for detailed study , but tlie mounted maps are almost indispensable for purposes of exhibition .

		While the maps are most interesting to specialists , they will satisfy a natural curiosity on the part of others to see the first map bearing the name
America	LOCATION	, and at the same time will afford an instructive glimpse of what was supposed in
the first # ind second decades of the sixteenth century	DATE	to be the form and extent of the world .

William Morris	PERSON	, and designed as a beauti - ful gift-book which shall also have a permanent vialue in one 's library , is Miss Gary 's latest work , '
Emerson	PERSON	, Poet and Thinker . '

		Before reading , one might expect to find here an aftermath , a repository of many significant thoughts culled from the
Emerson	LOCATION	centenary .

		On the contrary , the author has chosen for special emphasis the less usual aspects of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's mind and teachings , and hias avoided , sometimes with too apparent effort , a recital of the known factors in his outer and inner life .

		There are pages where a brief recalling of familiar incidents might enliven and illumine , and at the same time aid in the continuity of her study .

		In the main , however , the book is an interesting and well-balanced exposition of the subject in its restricted phases .

		Miss Gary has the faculty which she ascribes to
Emerson	LOCATION	, -- the ability to present many ' an old thought with a new face . '

		To her he has spoken an individual mes - sage , and this she has declared with grace and earnestness .

		She has given , not a portrayal of the man or the essayist , but rather a study of the moral artist , of ' the gracious art with which he has made morality beautiful . '

		Early in life , two agencies urged
Emerson	PERSON	toward soul-searching aspirations , in spite of great difficulties in tangible progress : first , the poverty in the
Emerson	LOCATION	home , combined with the persistent will toward an education ; second , the influence of
Mary Moody Emerson	PERSON	, his aunt , whose unique personality and potent counsel have already gained reflex fame in literature .

		By wide reading and carefully studied note - books of his own compilation , by intimate acquaintance with many models but no master in letters , by free intuitive meditation on the Universe and its symbols ,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy w!as formulated , so far as it ever had definite shape , while he was still a youth in years .

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	says truly : ` It is customary to think of
Emerson	LOCATION	as `` a philosopher '' and `` a , sage , '' but it is pleasanter , and possibly truer , to think of him as forever a meditative youth to whom life suddenly unfolded its beneficent meaning , making it impossible for him to grow old or dispirited .

		The teachings of his boyhood are marvellously like the teachings of his age , and the freshness of his response to precious intuitions of eternal truth is kept to the end of his career . '

		Emphasis is laid upon the tendency of Emer - son 's young manhood toward ill-healiii , and also on his affiliations with many men and women •

		One realizes anew the sanity , * the saving grace of common sense / which saved him from becom - ing , on the one hand a pampered invalid , on the other a fanatic on sociologidal reforms .

		As youth and man , he had a strange detachment from the mere accidents of life in his own personality or that of others .

		This detach - ment , this broad altruistic survey of life and its laws , rather than the mere incidents of per - sonal joy and sorrow , accounts for many of the beneficent and some of the disappointing phases of his dhai ^ cter and writings .

		Not a few of his companions in the past and his readers in the present have felt this impersonality , and have sympathized with
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's baffled effort to reach personal contact with the heart and soul of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	's chapter on Eeligion culminates in one emphasized thought , -- that
Emerson	PERSON	's appreciation of Christianity was positive though not exclusive , as verified by his words of non - conformity , ' Christianity is the most emphatic affirmation of spiritual nature , but it is not the only nor the last affirmation . '

		To
Emer	PERSON	- son , says
Miss Cary , Nature wi &	ORGANIZATION	s symbolic of spirit .

		His studies and inspiration were not in the specific beauties of meadow or stream , but in the firmament and the expansive elements .

		In the world of art he suggests
Corot	LOCATION	and
Daubigny	PERSON	, interpreting Nature in the large , with serenity yet severity .

		In the chapter which treats of the friendship with
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Miss Cary	ORGANIZATION	seems to show a marked favoritism for Emer - son .

		Eecognizing , as all students must , the contrasts in temperament , in vision , in the form of announcing the moral messages , all largely in
Emerson	LOCATION	's favor , many yet receive from Car - lyle an inspiration , a vital challenge and force , which is often lacking in
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		If
Carlyle	PERSON	was a bit caustic in saying of
Emerson	LOCATION	's lectures that they did not leave ' much to chew the cud upon , ' he only expressed in blunt words the criticism of many a true admirer of Etnerson .

		Is it just to
Carlyle	LOCATION	to contrast his intrepid queries and denunciations of evil with
Emer	PERSON	- son 's serene optimism , under the analogy of ' the noisy whining of undisciplined childhood ' ?

		Turning to Einerson the lecturer , the author instances especially his second visit to
England	LOCATION	, and introduces some effective side-lights upon the impressions which he left and those that he carried away from the home-land where he was never quite at home .

		His distrust of his poetic gifts , which long delayed the publication of his poems , suggests their threatened loss to national literature .

		That such a loss would have been very great no lover of poetry will question .

		Evidently Miss Cary has felt this charm in a superlative degree , else she would not indulge in such extreme praise , affirming that though we search for and find defective metres and rhymes and syntax yet ' we shall not have dis - turbed by a hair 's breadth our inner knowledge that we have been pecking and quibbling over the loveliest product of our national life . '

		Emerson 's editorship of ' The Dial , ' his con - tributions to it , and the revelation therein of his intellectual attitude on many themes of his day , receive full attention .

		His address to the readers , in the first number , is quoted at length ; while there is also a detailed study of the qual - ity and authorship of verse and prose in each successive issue .

		Moreover , an Appendix fur - nishes a complete list of all ' The Dial 's ' arti - cles , with authors specified as far as possible .

		Miss Cary refers to her sources of information in
Cabot	LOCATION	's Life of
Emerson	LOCATION	, and in the exhaus - tive article by Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	in the ` Journal of Speculative Philosophy ' in
1886	DATE	.

		The reviewer wonders , perhaps , why she did not use the later authority on the subject -- Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's introduction and ascriptions in the republication of ` The Dial ' in
1902	DATE	, for the
Eowfant Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		Miss Cary 's valuable study of Emierson closes with a chapter on the French estimate of him .

		We are familiar with many German criticisms and appreciations of our American seer and poet ; here are words of discriminating praise from M.
Montegut	LOCATION	contributed to the ` Revue des Deux Mondes , ' in
1847	DATE	and
1850	DATE	, and a re - cent estimate in the same journal , in
1902	DATE	, by
M. Roz	PERSON	, which raises question regarding the sym - pathy of
Emerson	PERSON	and the adaptation of his optimism to real life .

		Partially in answer is a translation , given by Miss Cary , of
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck 's essay on Transcendentalism and Symbol - ism , with interwoven comments on
Emerson	PERSON	as illustration , in ` Le Tresor des Humbles . '

		A few sentences fittingly express the responsive attitude , not alone of the French critic , but also of this latest American biographer .

		` But here at the same moment is
Emerson	LOCATION	, the good shepherd of the
morning	TIME	, in the pale verdant meadows of a new optimism , natural and credible .

		He does not insist that we skirt the abyss .

		He does not take us out of the humble , familiar inclosure , for the glacier , the sea , the eternal snows , the palace , the stable , the funeral pall of the pauper , the bed of sickness are all under the same heavens , purified by the same stars , and subject to the same infinite forces .

		He has enveloped us with silence , with wonder ... He is nearer than any one else to our habitual life .

		He is the sage of the common day , and common days make up the sum of our existence .

		* The volume is uniform in appearance with Miss Cary 's previous books , and like the others is a most attractive piece of book-making .

		Of especial interest is the series of photogravure illustrations , consisting in the main of portraits of
Emerson	LOCATION	and others of the
Concord	LOCATION	circle .

Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's latest -- and , - unfortu - nately , last -- ^ book is an attempt at the inter - pretation of tlie evolution of
Japan	LOCATION	according to the philosophic light and leading of the late
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		It is perhaps the best of Mr.
Heam	PERSON	's wonderful books on the
Japan	LOCATION	that is hidden from the average observer 's eyes .

		The steamships bring annually to
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	's rocky shores swarms of pilgrims led by
Heam	ORGANIZATION	's influ - ence .

		Some of these , with honest and critical intent , are unable to see what was so clear to this brilliant son of a Greek mother and an Irish father ; while others , who see not with their own eyes , but through those of
Hearn	LOCATION	, rave beyond his ravings .

		With amazing powers of perception and reception ,
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	lived a life of singular devotion .

		Most of his writing is subjective , -- too much so for the hon - est scholar or for one who knows the thought and evolution of
Japan	LOCATION	^ as her age-old literature reveals it .

		In his latest book , however , the method is scientific , -- coldly and pitilessly sci - entific , one might almost say ; and throughout its pages emotion is held captive to logic .

		The intensity and clearness of its revelation seem almost fearful .

		The author tells us that the Japanese are ruled by the dead , and that indi - viduality is not known to them .

		The whole social structure is built on ancestor-worship .

		He acknowledges the strangeness and charm of the country and people ; he tells us of the domestic and commun ` al cult , sihows us the evo - lution of the gods , reveals the strange forma - tion -LRB- so abhorrent to
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	ideas -RRB- of the family in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Then he pictures , with a realism almost gruesome , the rule of the dead , -- until he makes us wonder - whether he is not binding the selfsame sheaf with ` the sworn enemies of that religion , ' whom he holds up to such contempt .

		He re-presents and re-inter - prets the history of J ^ pan in a way that brings to mind
Winwood Eeade	ORGANIZATION	's ' Savage Africa ' or his ' Martyrdom of Man . '

		The Japanese are super - ficially Buddhists ; inwardly and to the roots of their `` being they are Shintoists .

		Their religion is loyalty .

		Shinto has revived .

		Occidental civilization is only a garment , a cloak .

		A law apart from custom is still practically worthless in the interior of the country .

		Ethics and cus - tom are one .

		The Japanese are still in the pre - Homeric stage of evolution .

		They will win in war , but they will sink before the onslaught of modem economic forces .

		Perhaps they are already unconsciously forging their own chains .

		Such are the pessimistic conclusions of Mr.

		Happily there are others who do not read his - tory or define religion as do
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	and
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, and who see in the very constitution of Japanese society the promise and potency of a nation that will be able not only to out-ride the economic typhoon but also to enter into the inheritance of the Occident and of the final philosophy and religion -- what - ever may be the ultimate and perfected fornis of these .

		In conclusion it may be said that in literary ch ` arm , in brilliancy and depth of color , in autumnal ripeness of thought , Mr.
Heam	PERSON	's ' interpretation ' will take its place among the best books of the opening century .

		The compilation entitled '
Japan	LOCATION	, by the Jap - anese ' is the outcome of a visit recently made to
Japan	LOCATION	by Mr.
Alfred Steaid	PERSON	, and is primarily intended to strengthen the faith of the political and financial allies of the islanders who are now crossing swords and measuring resources with

		The list of contributors includes many names of the highest authority , -- among others some of the noble fifty-five young men whose coup d'etat at Kioto in
1868	DATE	smote duarchv to death and restored monarchy in the form of an absolute imperialism , such as
Japan	LOCATION	had never known before in all her history .

		Sudh men , with accuracy in matters economic that can not be challenged , have written freely at Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's editorial command , or have furnished English translations of their speeches or official reports .

		The result is an encyclopaedia of up - to-date information that has timely and per - manent value .

		It is curious to note that while some of the writers show clearly in style and method the repressive and secretive spirit of the old feudalism in which they were reared , others like Inouve ,
Shibusawa	LOCATION	, and
Yamagata	LOCATION	are as frank as children in disclosing the full truth .

		All that one could wish to know , historically and in the light of the latest statistics , about
Japan	LOCATION	's material products , of factory and studio , of army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, of hygiene and finance , is here given with admirable prodigality .

		Noth - ing more in contrtast with the dark and secret ways of old
Japan	LOCATION	of the Tycoon days could be imagined .

Japan	LOCATION	, will heartilv wnelcome this portly store-hoUse of varied ' information .

		Slight in comparison is the lia : ht shed on literature , religion , and law in the '' island empire ; but at the same time the chapters on these subjects are the most read - able and suggestive of all .

		But , while the reader of this book has the ' Open Sesame ' to the material treasm-es of
Japan	LOCATION	, he gains no entrance into the invisible world of the Japanese mind .

		Not even the lord of the
Imperial Household	ORGANIZATION	, though he writes m ` any pages about ' The Imperial - Family , ' tells us anything of the Emperor 's real personality or domestic life .

		One need only peruse carefully the chapters on Japanese religion , education , and the position of women , to appreciate how deftly the reality is con - cealed .

		Verily , before such charming official politeness the average serious student of the Japanese will prefer the brutal frankness of the alien .

		Of the absurd preface , which vir - tually ignores the labors of over thirty years of scholarly research and publication , and of the minor faults of compilation and editing , we need not spe < ak .

		For those seeking statistics and official history the volume -LRB- offers abundant measure ; but those desirous of knowing the real
Japan	LOCATION	, and the thoughts and motives actuating individual and nation will find between these covers little to their purpose .

		An account of ` Japanese Life in Town and Country , ' written by Dr.
George W. Knox	PERSON	of the
Union Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, forms the initial volume in a projected series called ` Our Asiatic Neigihbors . '

		The book will hardly delight or satisfy those readers who want to know about the daily menu , household routine , business methods , or wardrobe of the people ; but it is by no means without its compensations .

		Per - haps the most distinguishing trait of scholiarly American writers on
Japan	LOCATION	lies in the fact that they avoid what is merely descriptive or prag - matic in externals and try , usually with notable success , to show us what is in the Japanese brain , and thus reveal to our understanding the springs of motive and action .

Knox	PERSON	is a scholar in Confucianism .

		Hence he knows well how the Japanese gentleman thinks and feels , and his sojourns in the homes of cultivated Japanese families make his book immensely and profitably different from the products of those writers to whom the geisha is the embodiment of Japanese womanhood .

		Knowing Buddhism well , also , he can tell us how the common people look out on the uni - verse , and why they enjoy their homeland so well .

		Professor
Knox	PERSON	shows admirably that the success of
Japan	LOCATION	's great civilizing popular religion was in art , rather than in ethics , or spiritual renovation , or inspiration .

		He sur - veys with insight and fascination the historical development and intellectual life of the people ; he pictures vividly the new

		This , and the influence of the gallant soldier from whom he was named , took him to the
Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	at
Annapolis	LOCATION	, and his life under the flag may be said to have begun there on
September 20 , 1856	DATE	.

		Naval Cadet
Schley	PERSON	was reared in the older manner , with sails and spars for his educational apparatus and extended cruises in strange waters for his discipline .

		His commission as midshipman was received
June 19 , 1860	DATE	, -- a time of portent and grave anxiety .

		His first voyage thereafter was to
Japan	LOCATION	on the good ship ' Niagara , ' and the voyage was not accom - plished until the return to
Boston	LOCATION	in
May , 1861	DATE	, there to learn of the actual outbreak of hostili - ties between the States .

		Of the decision there promptly reached by the young officer , he says : ` The writer was from
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		Before sub - scribing to the paper which was to record anew his fealty to the flag , sufficient time was asked to read the document carefully .

		This done , there was no hesitation in renewing his adhesion to the old flag .

		When this decision was announced to
Commodore McKean	PERSON	in his cabin , the writer by chance looked up through a windsail hatchway leading to the deck above , and there the folds of Old Glory were se & n in the sunlight gracefully unfolding its beauty to a soft and gentle breeze .

		The writer was standing directly under it , declaring the most sacred decision of his life to his Commander . '

		370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, element in every career ; and in this respect Rear Admiral
Schley	PERSON	has little complaint to make against the fates .

		With all his approved skill , opportunity for distinction might still have been lacking , -- and it never has been , down to the culmination of his professional life off
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	, on
July 3 , 1898	DATE	. '

		The first square-rigged prize captured during the Civil War , ' the ' General
Parkhill	PERSON	/ was his earliest independent command , taken soon after the * Niagara ' began the blockade of
Charleston	LOCATION	on
May 12 , 1861	DATE	.


August 31	DATE	he was promoted to be master , and assigned to the ' Potomac , ' Ms fellow master on that ship being the late Wil -
liam T. Sampson	PERSON	.

		Assigned to duty under Far - ragut in the Gulf blockade , young
Schley	PERSON	went under fire for the first time near
Fort Morgan	LOCATION	in
Mobile Bay	LOCATION	.

		Not long after , the intervention of European powers in
Mexico	LOCATION	led to the despatch to
Vera Cruz	PERSON	of the ' Potomac ' Eeturning ,
Schley	PERSON	was made lieutenant in
July , 1862	DATE	, and assigned as executive officer to the steam gunboat '
Winona	LOCATION	, ' where his first duty was the painful one of placing his superior officer under arrest for drunkenness .

		It was while in temporary com - mand of this ship that the following incident occurred , the pronoun referring to
Schley	PERSON	, while Farragut is the commander-in-chief mentioned .

		` Directions were given , him to report whenever the signals could be read .

		As the orders had been to destroy the -LSB- Confederate -RSB- battery , it was not thought that the signal then flying could refer to us , as our duty under them was specific and dis - tinct .

		Later , however , it was learned that the sig - nal was intended to withdraw us from action .

		Not understanding this at the moment , the action was continued until every gun of the enemy had ceased firing .

		Then the ship Ufted her anchor and dropped down with the current to her usual position , where , after anchoring , the customary visit was made to the commander-in-chief to report the result of the combat .

		Arriving on board , the writer found on the quarter-deck the commander-in-chief , who , after responding to his salute , said : ' `` Captain , you begin early in your life to dis - obey orders .

		Did you not see the signal flying for near an hour to withdraw from action ? '' '

		An attempt at explanation on the part of Lieutenant
Schley	PERSON	was met by the statement that Farragut ` wanted none of this ISTelson business in his squadron , about not seeing sig - nals . '

		Then , -- ` The admiral invited the writer into his cabin .

		The moment the door was closed behind him there was an entire change in his tone and manner as he said smilingly , ' ' I have censured you , sir , on the quarter-deck for what appeared to be a disregard of my orders .

		I desire now to commend you and your officers and men for doing what you believed right under the circumstances .

		Do it again when - ever in your judgment it is necessary to carry out your conception of duty .

		Will you take a glass of wine , sir ? '' '

		It would be both interesting and instructive to follow the deeds of this efficient American seaman step by step through the Civil War .

		But space does not permit more than to note that
Schley	PERSON	was placed in command of the *
Monongahela	LOCATION	, ' of which Admiral
George Dewey	PERSON	was made executive officer soon after - ward ,
Schley	PERSON	then becoming navigator of the ` Eichmond . '

		It was during the siege of Port Hudson that General
Agnus	PERSON	and the young lieutenant formed that friendship which has been of so much importance to them both .

		After being transferred to the ` Wateree , ' and making an extended cruise in South American waters as executive officer of that ship ,
Schley	PERSON	was transferred to the
Kaval Academy	ORGANIZATION	as instructor , becoming a lieutenant-commander .

		He had much and varied experience as execu - tive officer of the *
Benicia	LOCATION	' after ending his detail in that great school , playing an active part in the opening of
Corea	LOCATION	to the world , largely through the attack upon the forts in the
Salee River	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	.

		Several chapters are taken up with the story of the Greely relief expedition in
1884	DATE	.

		The account of the preliminary arrangements made under
Schley	PERSON	's supervision shows that thor - oughness was the first consideration , though celerity was none the less in mind .

		The com - ing upon the survivors , on
June 22	DATE	, as told in the book , loses nothing by its reserve .

		` The `` Bear , '' closely followed by the `` Thetis , '' arrived off the wreck camp cache about 10 p. m. , and there found Lieutenant Greely and six of his comrades in a tent which the violent gale had blown down over the party as they lay in their sleeping-bags .

		The other eighteen of his party had perished , some while seeking relief toward
Cape Isabella	LOCATION	; some drowned while sealing ; some had starved to death .

		The graves of a number were on a little ridge hardly two hundred feet away .

		` The condition of the survivors was desperate in the extreme , while the squalor of the camp as found was heartrending and distressing ... All those rescued were at the last limit of their endur - ance , as their swollen joints and great weakness indicated only too plainly .

		Life was a question of a few days at most to that noble band .

		It is a matter of grave doubt had the relief ships been delayed forty-eight hours whether a living soul would have been found of the party .

		It is even more certain that if their rescue had depended upon the whalers they could not have been reached in time . '

		Returning from the frozen North ,
Schley	PERSON	, who reached his captaincy in
April , 1888	DATE	, was appointed chief of the bureau of equipment and recruiting , and from that given command of the newly constructed war-ship '
Baltimore	LOCATION	, ' afterward to give so good an account of herself at
Manila Bay	LOCATION	.

		To this ship was confided the sorrowful honor of carrying the mortal part of the great inventor ,
John Ericsson	PERSON	, back to his native
Sweden	LOCATION	; and the end of this mission was marked by distinguished courtesies extended to the American sailors and their ship in several European capitals .

		While at
Kiel	ORGANIZATION	,
Schley	PERSON	met
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 Captain
von Diederich	PERSON	, who was also , it will be remembered , at
Manila Bay	LOCATION	.

		While commander of the '
Baltimore	LOCATION	/
Schley	PERSON	was sent to
Valparaiso	LOCATION	during the civil war through which Chili was then passing , and his strict enforcement of neutrality seems to have incited the public against him .

		At all events , it was the seamen under his command who were selected for injury on
October 16 , 1891	DATE	, and it was unquestionably
Schley	PERSON	's diligence in col - lecting evidence which enabled the American government to adjust the difficulty with sub - stantial justice to everyone concerned and with - out incurring the hostility of the new Chilean authorities Captain
Schley	PERSON	became inspector of the
Third Lighthouse District	ORGANIZATION	upon the conclusion of this extended ' cruise , and in that capacity laid the electric buoys which marked the chan - nels between the mouth of the
Chicago River	LOCATION	and the grounds of the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		In
September , 1895	DATE	, he took command of the '
New York	LOCATION	. '

		In connec - tion with that event , he makes the sensible observation that ' ships are worth just as much -LSB- as -RSB- and not a whit more than the men who command them . '

		In
March , 1897	DATE	, there was a transfer to the
Lighthouse Board	ORGANIZATION	, followed in
March , 1898	DATE	, by the appointment to command of the
Flying Squadron	ORGANIZATION	at
Hampton Eoads	LOCATION	,
Schley	PERSON	's commission as commander being dated on
February 6	DATE	of that eventful year .

		The Flying Squadron sailed on
May 13	DATE	, with
Schley	PERSON	on his flagship , the '
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, ' and from that time on his conduct has been the subject of the most heated and embittered con - troversy in the annals of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his statement of the facts involved , it must be said that
Schley	PERSON	maintains both dignity and reserve , refraining from acridity of personal criticism to a marked degree , and presenting a case which his adversaries will have difficulty in controverting .

		Thirteen of the thirty-seven chapters of the book are given up to the account of his cruising and fighting off the Cuban shores , and to the inquiry instituted regarding his conduct , so that it is impossible here to enter into details , even were it desirable at this time to rake over the ashes of scandals now fortunately moribund .

		It is to be said in conclusion that no history of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	can be relied upon which does not take into full account the statement of this important and interesting work , and that there is every reason for the national feeling embodied in the stanza : God save us war upon the seas , But , If it slip , Send such a Chief , with men like these .

		On such a ship !


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Holijday Publications .

		I. Lovers of
Florence	LOCATION	and of the
Brownings	ORGANIZATION	will unite in praising the sumptuous edition de luxe of Mrs.
Anna Benneson McMahan	PERSON	's volume entitled *
Florence	LOCATION	in the Poetry of the
Brown	PERSON	- ings ' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In her editorial capacity , Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	has wisely resisted the temptation to write anything but a brief preface , letting eight of the many Florentine poems of the Brownings make a better basis for illustration than any comment , however skilful , could pos - sibly do .

		Besides `
Casa Guidi Windows	ORGANIZATION	' and * 01d Pictures in
Florence	LOCATION	, ' which would be the inevitable selections for a Florentine anthology , she has chosen Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's ` The Dance , ' and
Robert Browning	PERSON	's ` Fra
Lippo Lippi	PERSON	, ' `
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	, ' ` The Statue and the Bust , ' Book L of ` The Rmg and the Book , ' and ` One Word More , ' These poems are illustrated by sixty reproductions of Florentine art and scen - ery , from the excellent photographs of the brothers
Alinari	PERSON	, printed in a soft tone of brown on Italian vellum .

		The picttires , which Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	has chosen individually to elucidate some obscure or interesting allusion of the poems , and collectively to let her readers see
Florence	LOCATION	as nearly as possible as the Brownings saw it , show squares , palaces and churches , quaint gate - way 's , scenic panoramas , frescoes , statuary , and paintings , the very stall where ` The Book ' was purchased , and finally Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's tomb and the Protestant cemetery where she lies buried .

		The frontispiece is of course a view of
Casa Guidi	ORGANIZATION	, the home of the poets for fourteen years , -- from whose windows Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	heard the voice of young
Italy	LOCATION	singing , and returning to which
Robert Browning	PERSON	, ' The Book ' in his hand , ' stepped out on the narrow terrace built Over the street and opposite the church .

		And paced its lozenge brick work sprinkled cool , ' while he watched the fateful drama of the Ring unfold itself again before his eyes .

		`
Casa Guidi Windows	ORGANIZATION	' and ` Old Pictures in
Florence	LOCATION	' gain most from this pictorial annotation , but the other poems gain , too , and conversely the Florentine scenes take on a new beauty and significance with the poems as a guide .

		The mechanical fea - tures of the book are perfect .

		It is elegantly printed on hand-made paper and bound in grey boards with white vellum back .

		The Florentine lily in heavy gold makes a simple and effective cover decoration .

		The volume is happily con - ceived and luxtmously executed , and it would be difficult to imagine a more beautiful gift-book of so enduring a type .

		The large-paper edition , to which the present notice has reference , is lim - ited to two himdred and fifty copies .

		One of the most beautiful and at the same time substantial of the season 's publications is Mr.
Edward Dillon	PERSON	's stout quarto on Porcelain , forming the second volume of ` The Connoisseur 's Library ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Appealing primarily to the collector , or at least to the connoisseur in ceram - ics , it is an exhaustive and scholarly treatment of a very definite subdivision of the general sub - 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ject , and is provided with an extensive and care - fully tabulated bibliography and a complete index .

		On the other hand , introductory chaptei `` s dealing with the physical and chemical nature of porcelain , the materials used ia its composition , the processes of mixing , fashioning , and firing , together with brief chapters on varieties of glaz - ing and methods of color decoration , make it pos - sible for the veriest tyro , if he is possessed of a reasonable amount of perseverance , to get both pleasure and profit out of Mr.
Dillon	PERSON	's admirable work .

		Besides popularizing the treatise , these introductory chapters furnish a basis for a more definite and technical treatment of the whole subject than would be possible without them , and prevent any tendency towards the vague general - izations of aesthetic criticism .

		For the rest , Mr.
Dillon	PERSON	has chosen , as a field hitherto imexploited by an authoritative English work , Chinese and European porcelain , with especial reference to the nature of the paste , the glaze , and the deco - ration of the various wares , and above all to any points that throw light on the historical con - tinuity of the eastern and western products .

		Little attention has been bestowed upon marks , a branch of the subject which Mr.
Dillon	PERSON	believes has already received exaggerated attention from collectors , to the neglect of more vital matters .

		A small collection of marks , however , is repro - duced from various catalogues .

		About half the book is devoted to the porcelain of
China	LOCATION	, treated historically and descriptively .

		The spreading of the art to neighboring countries , the importation of oriental wares into
Europe	LOCATION	, and the imitation which naturally resulted , are then briefly dis - cussed .

		Next German , French , and English por - celains are desciibed in detail , and a final chap - ter sums up the present condition of the art .

		No sort of justice can be done here to the orig - inality of subject-matter , or to the profound and at the same time clear and easy style of the book .

		It remains only to speak of the very beau - tiful illustrations , which are the excuse fur mentioning the volume at all in this connection .

		There are forty-nine plates in all , including reproductions both in color and photogravure , so that equal justice is done to the coloring and to the outlines and intricate patterns of the por - celain .

		The specimens reproduced are all notable , being for the most part from the collections in the British and
Victoria	PERSON	and
Albert Museums	PERSON	, or from such splendid private collections as those of Mr.
Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	and Mr.
David Currie	PERSON	.

		The collection of ` Pictures by George
Frederick Watts	PERSON	' -LRB-
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffleld & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is essentially what the title indicates , a book of pictures , with a brief introduction by
Julia Ellsworth Ford	ORGANIZATION	and
Thomas W. Lamont	PERSON	, who are also responsible for the selection and aiTangement of the illustra - tions .

		The introduction contains a short biography of the painter , and an appreciation of his art .

		This essa.y , which is necessarily superfi - cial , is unfortunately also vague .

		It lays par - ticular stress upon the symbolic and imaginative quality of
Watts	LOCATION	's art , without accurately defin - ing the type of symbolism referred to , and upon his theory of the intellectual function of painting and its close relation to poetry without any off - setting statements about his technique .

		With the idea of emphasizing these same qualities , the pic - tures chosen for full-page reproduction are all of the allegorical type , and each is accompanied by a brief selection in vei * se or imaginative prose .

		The reproductions , consisting of platinum prints mounted on rough grey paper and a number of half-tones , are very satisfactory ' .

		Indeed the luxurious character of the book makes its defec - tive plan all the more evident .

		It is to be deplored that
Watts	PERSON	's portrait work has been relegated to so insignificant a place in the vol - ume ; the introduction accords it a cursory men - tion , and five half-tones in the text of the intro - duction are all the illustration it receives .

		The plan of accompanying the allegoi-ical pictures by literary extracts is likely to mislead , particularly since the selection is not carefully made .

		Some - times the passage chosen adds nothing to the obvious meaning of the pictures ; in at least one or two cases it is not of sufficient poetical value to warrant its use in any such connection .

		Again , it is certainly a mistake to quot ``
Browning	PERSON	's ` Eurydice to Orpheus , ' with an incorrect title , as a commentary upon
Watts	PERSON	's ' Orpheus and
Eury	PERSON	- dice . '

		It will be remembered that
Browning	PERSON	departed from the traditional details of the myth , giving it a new interpretation of which there is no suggestion in
Watts	LOCATION	's painting .

		Thus , while the book is a beautiful art volume and will be of value for its pictures to students of
Watts	LOCATION	and modem painting , it is by no means the schol - arly and well proportioned volume that might easily have been provided within the same limits .

		Among the most attractive of the more sub - stantial holiday issues is Sainte-Beuve 's ` Por - traits of the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, ' selected and translated from the French by Miss
Katherine P. Wormeley	PERSON	.

		The essays have been chosen from the 'Cause ries du
Lundi	LOCATION	, ' the ` Portraits de Femmes , ' and the ` Portraits Litteraires . '

		They have been slightly condensed by the omission of passages regarding long-forgotten editions , or discussions about style , which could not be made clear in English ; and in cases where two or more essays about the same person appeared in the different series , they are combined , to avoid repetition .

		Miss
Wormeley	ORGANIZATION	's reputation as a translator is already well established , so that it is not necessary to dwell upon the fact that her rendering of the essays is graceful , supple , and finished .

		The work is issued in two octavo volumes , handsomely bound in buckram , and illustrated with about thirty half-tone portraits .

		As a principle of selection , to guide a choice among the forty and more volumes of
Sainte	LOCATION	-
Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's critical output , none more suitable could have been devised than the
seventeenth century	DATE	-- the golden age of
France	LOCATION	.

		Volume one contains fifteen studies of the men and women who adorned the court of
Louis	LOCATION	Le Grand ; volume two opens with a history of the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	and completes the seventeenth century picture with a dozen critiques of the literary men and women of the epoch .

		Either volume may be procured separately if desired .

		Together , they form a representative collection of the best that Sainte-Beuve achieved -- which means the
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 very best critical work of the nineteenth century .

		Brilliant , keen , the product of profound learning and minute research , they are nevertheless popu - lar and delightfully spontaneous in style .

		It is pleasant to be able to own a significant group of his essays in an edition so well-made and so scholarly as this one .

		With the publication of `
New France	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	'
Messrs. Ploughton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	com - plete their sumptuously illustrated edition of
John Fiske	PERSON	's histories of the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	from the settlement of
Virginia	LOCATION	to the adoption of the constitution .

		This ninth and last volume of the set is beautifully printed from new plates and bound uniformly with the others in polished red buckram .

		Great pains have been taken in get - ting together the illustrative material .

		Nothing has been admitted for the sake of mere embel - lishment , but the historical societies , libraries , and private collections , both in this country and in
Europe	LOCATION	, have been drawn upon for con - tempoi-ary material in the shape of historical pic - tures , portraits , original manusei'ipts , maps , autographs , title pages , and other documents .

		Many of these have never before been reproduced , and none have been utilized unless their source and authenticity could be established beyond doubt .

		The new volume contains more than two hundred plates and a number of fine photogravure portraits , all of the greatest interest to stu - dents of the period .

		Each plate is carefully described , and the present location of the origi - nal is indicated , in the list of illustrations .

		It is comparatively seldom that an historian is able to complete a cycle of work so significant and comprehensive as Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's , and we can not be sufficiently grateful that he was permitted to round out his labors with this last volume , which , it will be remembered , he had barely completed at the time of his death .

		This tasteful and eminently scholarly illustrated edition is a fitting and imposing tribute to his memory .

		The barrier of obsolete speech , real or assumed but in either case equally effective , is the apology offered by Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	for rendering ` The
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	' into modern prose .

		The idea of modernization is of course not new , but all previous versions have been metrical , whereas Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	feels that prose , following as closely as possible the wording and construction of Chaucer , is more likely to pro- mote interest in the original than verse , which inevitably tends to direct attention to a modern poet .

		Upon this theoi-y he has made his prose version , carefully avoiding archaisms that are not easily intelligible , occasionally condensing a passage to satisfy propriety or relieve prolixity , but in the main exactly paraphrasing the text .

		It can not be expected that such a version will retain the full flavor of the original , but the fourteenth century spirt is there , and the prose is , besides , easy , graceful , and rhythmical .

		As a representative selection from the ` Tales , ' Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	has chosen the Prologue , the Knight 's Tale , the
Prioress	ORGANIZATION	's Tale , the Nun 's Priest 's Tale , the Physician 's Tale , and those of the Pardoner , the Wife of Bath , the Clerk , the
Squire	PERSON	, the
Franklin	PERSON	, and the
Canon Yeoman	ORGANIZATION	, with enough of their accompanying prologues , epilogues , and links to make the underlying structure of the poem clear .

		Mr.
Walter Appleton Clark	PERSON	has embellished the text with six colored illustra - tions , one of which has been \ ` ignetted into the cover .

		The designs are bold and quaint , and the coloring rich and beautiful enough to suggest the mellow tints of an illuminated missal .

		Fine paper and excellent typography combine with suitable illustration to produce a luxurious piece of book-making , worthy of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's scholarly purpose , and likely to attract readers of fastidious taste .

		-LRB-
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Friends of ` Uncle Remus ' -- and who is not a friend of the delightful old story-teller ?

		-- will welcome the rhymed version of ` The Tar Baby , * now offered in a handsome holiday volume -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , containing also twenty-five other rhymes of IJncle Remus , all but one of which tell entirely new stories .

		Cover , end papers , page borders and headings show ` Brer Fox , ' ` Brer Rabbit , ' and the rest of the brotherhood in min - iature pen-and-ink sketches of tmusual clever - ness , the work of Messrs.
Kemble	PERSON	and
Frost	ORGANIZATION	, Uncle Remus 's official illustrators , who have also provided a generous number of full-page draw - ings in tint and color , reflecting perfectly the delicious humor of the text .

		About two-thirds of the rhymes are animal tales ; the rest are plantation melodies and revival hymns .

		The author 's note explains that the rhymed version of the Tar Baby is probably a good deal nearer to the genuine form than the prose story , which is the reason for re-telling it here .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	also forestalls objection to the monotonous rhythm of Uncle Remus 's verse by calling atten - tion to its primitive character .

		Whether one pre - fers Uncle Remus in prose or in verse , he will want to have this book for its pictorial features , if on no other account .

		Another sheaf of Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	's cartoons has been gathered into the usual holi - day folio , corresponding in size , shape , and bind - ing with the rest of the regular collections of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's drawings .

		The new book is named ` Every Day People , ' and appears with the imprint of the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		We shovdd hardly characterize any of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's people as strictly of the ` every day ' sort , but there is certainly more realism , as well as more variety of type and situation , here than in the earlier drawings .

		The lovely
Gibson	PERSON	girl peeps out from an occasional corner , and there are two or three real
Gibson	PERSON	men and one
Gibson	PERSON	Cupid ; but the rest of the people are the familiar and verj ' un-ideal types of the street , the club , and the ball - room .

		We can not exj > ect Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	to ring changes indefinitely upon the sentimental-satiric theme with which he began his career .

		As his line of work broadens , he is getting better con - trol of it , and there is more humor and better drawing in this book than in the last two or three that the artist has given us .

		A book about ` The Mountains ' -LRB-
McClure	PERSON	,
Phil	PERSON	- lips
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the logical successor of ` The For - est , ' in which Mr.
Stewart Edward White	PERSON	proved himself too agreeable a camp-mate to be let off at the end of one trip .

		Like the other book , this 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, is the story of a real expedition , and we are assured that it is all strictly true except as regards the Tenderfoot , who is a composite truth -- ` the apotheosis of many tenderfeet ' whom Mr.
White	PERSON	has known .

		One key to the charm of Mr.
White	PERSON	's outdoor books is the practical and very lively directions about taking the trail with which he begins them .

		Having found out what to carry , how to choose your horses , how to pre - pare yourself for the trip by the mastery of such practical details as pack-hitches and swim - ming at your horse 's tail , you are as keen for the long trail as were Mr.
White	PERSON	and the two friends who went with him on this journey across the
Coast Ranees of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then there is a freshness and zest about the descriptions , a judicious admixture of character-study and adventure , and a pleasant humor , which will recommend this book to many people who do not care much for the modem nature literature .

		We are not told that Mr.
Femand Lungren	PERSON	, who has drawn pictures of the mountain trip , was one of the three in Mr.
White	PERSON	's party , but we are sure that he must have been .

		At any rate he gets Mr.
White	PERSON	's point of view exactly , and seizes upon the dramatic moments and the char - acteristic scenes for his pictures , which are a real addition to the annals of the trip .

		Prof.
Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	's unique volume of Elizabethan sketches entitled ` The Queen 's Progress ' is described by its author as made up of ` some of the lighter matters that have floated on a stream of reading and study which has already carried , let it be hoped , a somewhat weightier freight . '

		The essays need no such apology .

		The easy fashion in which they deal with some of the more trivial aspyects of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan life presupposes a close study of its more essential features ; and their graceful style light - ens , but does not conceal , their erudition .

		The title essay re-tells the familiar story of
Eliza	LOCATION	- beth 's visit to
Kenilworth	LOCATION	as it is to be found in the quaint letter of
Laneham	LOCATION	, ' a dapper little clerk of the council chamber , ' writing ostensibly for ` hiz friend , a citizen and merchaunt of Lon - don , ' but really for the book-sellers .

Robert Greene	PERSON	's libel of Shakespeare in ' A Groats - worth of Wit , ' and the romantic friendship of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	and
Fulke Greville	ORGANIZATION	.

		are some of the other themes .

		All are handled with the same sure touch , and bear evidence to a thorough understanding of the diverse interests which went to make up the rapid , pulsing life of the time .

		The book is issued by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a dignified , well-made edition , with six fine photogravure portraits .

		Fastidious holiday buyers will appreciate its unusual charm of style and a corresponding distinction in mechanical make-up .

		Very pretty library editions of Lord
Macau	LOCATION	- lay 's Essays , and the Tales and Poems of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, are published in uniform style and binding , with illustrations , by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Each set is in six handy-size volumes , printed on thin but strong paper , simply bound in blue cloth with gold lettering , and neatly boxed .

		The Macaulay set has frontis - pieces in photogravure , besides eight or nine half-tones in each volume , picturing persons or places mentioned in the text .

		Many of these are reproduced from choice old prints or engravings , and should be of real interest to a student of the essays .

		In the edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	five volumes are filled with his stories , and the remaining one contains the poems and the significant and inter - esting series of essays upon ` The Poet 's Art . '

		The illustrations are by Mr.
F. S. Cobum	PERSON	, who has accomplished his difficult task with a fair degree of success , clioosing situations sufficiently gruesome and mysterious to be characteristic , and yet keeping , with possibly one or two excep - tions , well within the bounds of good taste .

		The absence of photogravure frontispieces in this set is compensated for by more elaborate head-bands and tail-pieces , and a greater number of illus - trations to the volume .

		The small size and attractive features of these editions will make them desirable holiday gifts .

		The story of ` Monarch , the
Big Bear of Tallac	ORGANIZATION	' is Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	's contribution to the year 's holiday literature -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		As he takes pains to state distinctly in the foreword that his story is not intended to be pure science , but is rather an historical novel of Bear life , its aim being to convey the truth , but the truth about an unusual and composite animal , we do not see how it can result in any prolonga - tion of the recent controversy about the genuine - ness of Mr.
Seton	PERSON	's writings .

		The story of ` Monarch ' is longer than most of his narratives , so that it fills out an attractive little volume , which has of course been illustrated and decor - ated by its author .

		The marginal drawings are not so clever as some of his earlier work , but the full-page pictures of the cub `
Jack	PERSON	' are irresistibly humorous , and the story of his evo - lution from an affectionate and mischievous lit - tle household pet into the mysterious and ruth - less sheepkiller of
Tallac	ORGANIZATION	is as thrilling and pathetic as anything Mr.
Seton	PERSON	has given us .

		Messrs.
Adam	PERSON	and
Charles Black	PERSON	's notable series of books illustrated in color is augmented this year by a volume descriptive of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pictures are by Mr.
John Fulley	PERSON	- love , who has already painted
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and the Holy Land for the same series ; and the accom - panying text is by Mrs.
A. Murray Smith	PERSON	, who writes entertainingly of the foundation of the
Abbey	LOCATION	, its evolution from a royal chapel to a national burial-ground , and the progressive steps of its building and re-building .

		Finally she con - ducts her readers through an exhaustive tour of the interior .

		Whether used as a guide-book to the
Abbey	LOCATION	, or by stay-at-home readers as a source of information , the account should prove intex ' - esting and valuable .

		Mr.
Fulleylove	PERSON	's twenty - one pictures show the Abbey outside and in , including probably every favorite and important view except the cloisters , and a nimiber of inter - esting details such as the coronation chair ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's tomb , and the early brasses and pic - turesque tombs in
St. Edmund	LOCATION	's
Abbey	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL .

		375 plates are artistic and daintily colored , but it is a question whether the choice of
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	as a subject for colortype illustrations was a wise one .

		Certainly to most readers these pictures will seem to strike the wrong note , lay - ing emphasis on color -- and a very individual color-scheme at that , -- instead of upon structure , which is surely the memorable feature of any Gothic cathedral not pre-eminently distinguished for its windows .

		The aristocratic pussy of the bench-show has had her book , written for her by Miss
Helen Winslow	PERSON	.

		Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	has given us the epic of the cat race , and a subtle interpreta - tion of its genius , in ` The Fireside Sphinx .

		* There is left the common fireside pussy , and Miss
Sara Trueblood	PERSON	has now made a book about her .

		It is called ` Cats by the Way , ' -- that is , the cats you meet in morning strolls , alley cats and tramp cats that pro \ ^ i by night , the cats that live at your friends ' houses or by your own hearth-stone , the good old-fashioned every-day cat that wins your love and sometimes your pity , and loves you in return .

		Little histories of a score or more of such cats make up
Miss Trueblood	LOCATION	's volume ; and all the incidents , the author assures us , are true to life .

		Miss
Trueblood	PERSON	is a versatile genius , and the little pictures of the cats and cat families , scattered through the book , are also the woi ' k of her hand .

		` Cats by the Way ' is unpretentiously bound , as befits its humble sub - ject , with two intelligent-looking pussies staring at us from the front cover .

Lippincott	PERSON	. -RRB-

		Dog-lovers also have their book this year , and a very charming one it is .


Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	's study of ` Our Friend the Dog ' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is as delightful in its Avay , though not so unusual , as ` The Life of the Bee ' by the same author .

		The particular dog that furnishes the occasion for the essay is a small bull-pup named Pelleas , who died when he was barely six months old .

		` Polleas had a great , bulging , powerful fore - head , like that of Socrates or
Verlaine	PERSON	; and , under a little black nose , blunt as a churlisli assent , a pair of large hanging and symmetrical chops , which made his head a sort of massive , obstinate , pensive and three-cornered menace . '

		According to
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's interpretation , the dog is the only animal that really loves us .

		The horse is ` uncertain and craven ' ; the cow and the ox ` docile because for centuries they have not had a thought of their own ' ; the cat ` curses us in her mysterious heart ' ; the rest tolerate our dominion through fear or love of ease .

		But the dog is , and has always been , the friend of man ; he worships him as a god and serves him as a slave .

		Just when the discussion of this thesis is growing a little too mystical , Pelleas brings it back to earth with a wag of his friendly tail .

		Mr.
Paul Meylan	PERSON	has drawn him delightfully , and another artist has decorated the cover and pages very effectively , making the memoir of Pelleas altogether one of the most pleasing of the year 's holiday productions .

		A significant contribution to the history of the gi-eat water-ways of
America	LOCATION	is Mr.
Edgar Mayhew Bacon	PERSON	's ' Nai-ragansett Bay : Its His - toric and Romantic Associations ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	has a way of investing local history with a meaning and a charm which the mere explorer of dry-as-dust records entirely misses .

		For one thing , his point of view is broader ; it embraces an interest in both the authentic his - tory and the picturesque legends of a district , and also in its intrinsic beauty as landscape .

		Then his work is done slowly and pleasantly , and consequently is accurate and weighty , without being labored .

		Finally he never loses sight of the human interest which , in the last analysis , is the redeeming feature of antiquarian studies .

		Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	was attracted to the
Narragansett	ORGANIZATION	country because of the important part played by its settlers ` in the development of American ideas and ideals , ' as well as by its singularly romantic legends and the matchless beauty of set - ting which the bay affords .

		Readers who know and love the region will enjoy cruising with Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	among the islands , and rambling about the historic old towns with their musical Indian names and prim
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	traditions .

		Fifty pic - tures from sketches by the author and many others from photographs , together with a hand - some binding , give the book a holiday air .

		Mr.
Walter Taylor Field	PERSON	's work on
Rome	LOCATION	, issued in two daintily proportioned volumes , prettily bound and copiously illustrated , may be called a literary guide-book to the wonders of the
Eternal City	LOCATION	, It is a chatty , informal account of a dozen rambles , suitable to be under - taken in as many days , and so planned as to give the visitor a sight of the monviments , churches , and galleries most worthy of his atten - tion .

		Several maps , carefully marked with routes and objects of interest , make the jouniey - ings easier of accomplishment , whether they are taken in reality or in imagination .

		For Mr.
Field	PERSON	explains that in venturing to add his con - tribution to the vast literature that clusters about
Rome	LOCATION	, he has meant to steer a middle course between the bairrenness of the guide-book and the discursiveness of the essay , and so make a book that will be useful to the traveller in his sight-seeing and to the travel-lover who wishes to visit
Rome	LOCATION	from the vantage-ground of his own hearth-stone .

		We are sure that both classes of readers will enjoy these volumes , whose small size and full illustration make them especially desirable as gifts .

		The set forms the latest title in the Messrs. Page 's ` Travel-Lover 's Library . '

		After having obtained a bird 's eye view of
Rome	LOCATION	from the work just mentioned , it will be pleasant to turn , for a more intimate study of the city and its people , to Mrs.
Maud Howe Elliott	PERSON	's delightful volume of reminiscences , entitled `
Roma Beata	PERSON	' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book had its beginning in a series of letters which Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	wrote to her sister , Mrs.
Laura Richards	PERSON	.

		From these and other letters and diaries , records of several summers spent in
Rome	LOCATION	and its environs , she has made a vol - ume which preserves the epistolary form and feeling , sparkles with humor , and runs over with unique and entertaining experiences such as could not possibly fall to the lot of the ordinary tourist .

		A few chapter titles will serve better than anything else to indicate the character of 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the book : ' A Visit to Queen
Margaret	PERSON	, ' ' A Presentation to Leo the Thirteenth , ' * Roman Codgers and Solitaries , ' ` Black Magic and White , ' ` Strawberries of Nemi . '

		A dozen illus - trations , fi'om Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	's drawings and from photographs , add a decorative touch to this tempting volume .

		` The Poet 's Comer ' is the apt title of a port - folio of amusing cartoons in which Mr.
Max Beer	PERSON	- bohn has hit oft ' with his usual audacity the peculiarities of a number of celebrities ranging from
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	to Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	.

		.

		Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	presenting Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	to the Queen of the Fairies ,
Robert Browning	PERSON	taking tea with the members of the
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- who are of course too high-minded to trouble with tea -RRB- ,
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	disporting him - self in his back garden among his pets and his Pre-raphaelitish friends ,
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	` Table-talking , '
William Shakespeare	PERSON	enforcing secrecy with one hand and holding the other behind him to receive a manuscript from
Lord Bacon	LOCATION	, and Rudyard Kipling taking ' a bloomin ' Iday aht , on the blasted ` eath , along with
Bri	PERSON	- tannia ` is gurl , ' are some of the best of ` Max 's ' witty and absolutely irreverent portraits .

		There are twenty in all , printed in colors and bound in a board folio .

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- It is somewhat disconcerting , even in these days of profuse illustration , to come upon a pictorial edition of
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	's ` The Intellectual Life . '

		The method adopted in
Messrs. Little	LOCATION	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new reprint is very simple : from the cursory literary allusions in which
Hamerton	ORGANIZATION	's text abounds , nine have been chosen , apparently at random , and a pic - ture of the locality or person referred to has been inserted at the proper page in the text .

		This results in half-tone portraits of
Byron	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Da Vinci	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and views of
Fonthill Abbey	ORGANIZATION	and
Blea Tarn	LOCATION	.

		We wonder a little at the lack of variety in the editor 's choice , and would sug - gest that without altering the position of the pictures he might substitute George Sand for
Scott	PERSON	, Fielding for
Byron	PERSON	, and Kepler for Words - worth , thus avoiding a misleading emphasis upon nineteenth century poets , and securing at least equal relevancy to the text .

		It should be added that the new edition is well printed on paper of good quality , handsomely bound in red and gold , and contains an excellent frontispiece por - trait of the author in photgravure .

		` The Messages of the
Masters	ORGANIZATION	, ' Dr.
Amory Bradford	PERSON	's volume of appreciations of ten of the world 's greatest paintings , has proved popular enough to justify
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in issu - ing it in a cheaper edition .

		This is printed from the same plates used in the earlier edition , but half-tones have been substituted for photo - gravures of the paintings discussed , and the book is neatly bound in boards with linen back .

		Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	's method is to speak briefly of the aesthetic value of each painting , and then dwell upon its spiritual meaning .

		For instance , in writ - ing of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's ` Old Temeraire ' his theme is ` The Message and Ministry of the Sky . '

		The
Sistine Madonna	ORGANIZATION	suggests ' A Christmas Medi - tation , ' and Bume -
Jones	PERSON	's ` Nativity ' leads him to speak of ' The Humanity of the Divine . '

		This sort of interpretation appeals to many readers who do not care for art criticism nor for unvarnished sermonizing .

		For such persons ' The Messages of the
Masters	ORGANIZATION	' in its new dress will make a suitable and inexpensive gift .

		A certain sameness of motive runs through all Miss
Onoto Watanna	PERSON	's stories , and ` The Love of Azalea ' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is no exception to this rule .

		There is always a piquant little Japanese girl -- this time a sort of Cinderella minus a god-mother -- who speaks delicious ` pigin ' English and outrages convention by marrying a ` foreign devil ' -- in this case a young American missionaiy .

		He is obliged to go to
America	LOCATION	, leaving her behind him , whereupon her cruel step-mother and a rich and wicked lover conspire to starve and trick her into submission to their desires .

		After a good deal of tragedy , the missionary comes to his wife 's rescue , and all ends happily at last .

		The little story is prettily told , and prettily illustrated by a
Japan	LOCATION	- ese artist ,
Gazo Foudji	PERSON	, who has made six full - page illustrations in color , and a dainty series of marginal decorations , which are printed in violet to match the be-flowered cover .

		In his volume entitled ` Old Love Stories Retold ' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	has managed to make a very readable book out of materials either hackneyed or other - wise unpromising .

		He does not assume that all the phases of love which he describes are ideal , but only that they are all typical , each standing for a multitude of less famous , but no less genuine , exj > eriences .

		The prettiest story in the book is that of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Beatrice	PERSON	, the most appealing that of
Heine	LOCATION	and
Mathilde	PERSON	-- the fat , stupid , merry-hearted wife , whom the unhappj '' poet came as near to loving as his bitter heart would let him love any one .

		Of the eight stories , six are already familiar to readers of ` The Cos - mopolitan . '

		They gain additional attractiveness from their new setting , with tinted illustrations and the inevitable page border , -- in this case suit - able , graceful , and unobtrusive .

		The binding is of grey boards , with leather back .

		` The
Castle Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
Thompson Buchanan	PERSON	, is a pretty little romance of the time of
Napoleon	PERSON	, with an exciting plot made up of love and sword-play in equal parts .

		The scene is laid in
England	LOCATION	, but some of the characters are French , and others pretend to be .

		The hero is a nobleman disguised as a dancing master , who resembles
Monsieur Beaucaire	PERSON	in quick wit , gal - lant address , and dare-devil recklessness .

		Four pleasing colored illustrations and appropriate page decorations by Miss
Elizabeth Shippen Green	PERSON	, together with a delicate violet cover , con - tribute to make this a very tempting holiday volume of the lighter sort .

		-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	. -RRB-

		` Love Finds a Way , ' one of the late
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	's short stories , has been made into a delectable holiday volume by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	's drawings and Miss
Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	's floral borders and cover design are the decorative features .

		The storv is not one of Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's best , but it is good
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 enough to make us wish that its author were still writing , or that his mantle had fallen upon some - body else .

		Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	is very successful at depicting the sentimental ` man and girl ' situa - tion , and his work here is as dainty and care - fully finished as usual .

		Miss Armsti'ong 's designs are always remarkable for their grace - fulness and beauty of coloring , so that altogether this is as pretty a book as any gift-hunter need desire .

		Another book to which a cover designed bj ' Miss Mai-garet
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	adds a touch of dis - tinction is ` Li'l ' Gal ' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a col - lection of Mr.
Paul Laurence Dunbar	PERSON	's negro lyrics , the title being taken from the first poem .

		Miss
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	has also designed page borders , and Mr.
Leigh Richmond Miner	PERSON	of the
Hampton Institute Camera Club	ORGANIZATION	has taken the photographs , which form a rich and suitable illustrative set - ting for the verses .

		This is not the first time that Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	and members of the
Hampton Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute
Camera Club	ORGANIZATION	have co-operated in book-mak - ing , but their latest venture is more than ever deserving of praise for its harmonious , tasteful , and spirited transcription of negro life .

		The volimie entitled `
Japan	LOCATION	in Pictures ' -LRB-
Warne	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is aptly described by Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	, author of the text and collector of the photographs , as being a sort of ` lantern-lecture ' between covers .

		The pictures , of which there are about seventy-five , are grouped according to six topics : water-life , crops and flowers , landscape , temples , streets and street life , manners and customs ; and each group is preceded by a com - pact and business-like introduction .

		By wasting no time on generalities , Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	manages to compress a vast amount of miscellaneous and very entertaining information into his ` lecture , ' and the pictures serve to fix it in the reader 's mind .

		The album is just the thing with which to temp > er one 's ignorance and correct one 's misconceptions about the enterprising little island kingdom that is occupying so much of the world 's attention at present .

		The Christmas shopper has come to depend upon finding something of Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	's ready for him each year in sumptuous holiday dress .

		This season Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	reissue an old and favorite volume , ` Nature and Culture , ' with tinted photogravures made from a series of very artistic photographs by Mr.
Rudolf Eiekemeyer	PERSON	, Jr. .

		These pictures show scenes in the woods and fields , by the sea - shore or the road-side , each illustrating some brief and vivid passage of natural description taken from the essays .

		The volume is further decorated by head and tail pieces somewhat symbolic in character .

		The cover design is too heavy for the best effect , and , we think , very inartistically colored .

		Among the many ` miniature ' volumes which make such popular holiday gifts , none are daintier or more attractive than the ` Thumb Nail Series ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Three new volumes are now added , --
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ` As You Like It ' and ` Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, ' and
Washington	LOCATION	Irv - ing 's account of ` An Old English Christmas ' taken from ` The Sketch Book . '

		As usual , the leather covers are embossed with symbolic designs done by Mrs.
Blanche McManus Mans	PERSON	- field , and the author 's portrait serves as a frontispiece for each volume .

		` An Old English Christmas , ' with its story of quaint Yule-Tide customs , and the peacock pie and boar 's head trimmed Avith holly on the cover , is sure to be a favorite with Christmas buyers .

		Another deservedly popular seizes of bibelots is the `
Ariel	ORGANIZATION	' library of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , which has grown to include nearly one hun - dred well assorted classics .

		These tiny booklets are clearly printed on deckel-edge paper , with photogravure frontispieces -LRB- generally portraits -RRB- , and are bomid in flexible red morocco , with rib - bon markers .

		The fourteen additional volumes of this year offer plenty of variety to the intend - ing purchaser . '

		Castle Rackrent and Other Irish Tales ' by
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	and
John	PERSON	and
Michael Banim	PERSON	appears with an introductory study of Irish flction and short biographical notices by Mr.
W. B	PERSON	,
Yeats	PERSON	.

		The ` Counter - blaste to Tobacco ' of
James I.	PERSON	is printed with the original preface by its royal author and a postsci-iptum account of the practical measures which he took to enforce his anti-tobacco cru - sade .

		Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	furnishes a bio - graphical note for Swift 's ` Gulliver 's Voyage to
Lilliput	LOCATION	, ' and this volume is embellished with a number of illustrations , in addition to the cus - tomary frontispiece .

		Among the other volumes are
Washington Irving	LOCATION	's ` Old Christmas , '
Robert Browning	PERSON	's companion poems ` Christmas Eve ' and ' Easter Day , ' and
Fouque	ORGANIZATION	's ' Undine . '

		The trouble with Mr.
Edwin F. Webster	PERSON	's book of ` Strenuous Animals ' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is that it is too strenuous .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's fables are so ingenious and his beasts such remarkable devia - tions from the order of nature that no amount of realism in the atmosphere of the stories will make them ` go down . '

		The bear who fed another bear with nitro-glycerine and then blew him up , the bee who got drunk on whisky and water and aftei-wards became a teetotaler , the bull-dog who emulated the swiftness of the grey - hound by wearing balloons , and the eagle who hunted its prey with field glasses , may amuse some readers ; but the humor is too exaggerated to gain a wide public .

		Good nonsense needs a much lighter touch .

		The best story in the book is the one about a jumping frog , as wonderful in his way as his famous prototype endeared to us by
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	and ` Bob ' Addams have illustrated the stories .

		` Upland Pastures , ' a series of nature essays by Miss
Adeline Kjiapp	PERSON	, has been issued in a limited autograph edition by
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is bound in cloth and leather of a light green shade , and printed from type on Ruisdael hand-made paper .

		Mr.
William Keith	PERSON	's painting of ` Upland Pastures , ' reproduced in photogravure , is the frontispiece ; and rubricated running-heads and initials set in simple borders constitute its only other ornamentation .

		The result is a harmonious and elegant piece of book - making .

		Miss
Knapp	PERSON	's essays are informal jot - tings of things heard and seen , or thought , in spring-time and
summer	DATE	rambles .

		Belonging to 378 THE DIAL .

Dec. 1	DATE	, the reflective rather than to the dramatic type of nature essays , they aim to arouse an interest in the smaller aspects of the outdoor world , par - ticularly in the wonderful economy of plant life .

		They read pleasantly and easily , with a sugges - tion of Mr.
Hamilton Mabie	PERSON	's method and point of view .

		` The Old Mastei-s and their Pictures , ' a com - prehensive art manual for beginners by Miss
Sarah Tytler	PERSON	, is issued by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new illustrated edition , with twenty good half-tone plates reproducing twenty of the famous paintings referred to in the text .

		There is no question that illustration helps to make a book of this sort attractive and illuminating , and
Miss Tytler	PERSON	's work is good enough to deserve whatever assistance pictorial embellishment can lend it .

		The popular character of the book , its ornamental binding , and the pictures , bring it into the cat ^ ory of holiday publications . '

		A Journey in Search of Christmas ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the inviting title of a holiday volume by Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	.

		Of course it is Lin McLean who takes the journey , first to
Cheyenne	LOCATION	and finally to
Denver	LOCATION	, where he succeeds in running down Christmas in lavish western fashion .

		The story is more or less made to order , but has a good deal of vitality about it for all that .

		Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric
Remington	PERSON	has drawn three pictures of Lin , making him look very much like all the rest of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's cow-boys , and has also made tinted pag ' e decorations which furnish an interesting running comment on the text .

		The cover is very gaudy , -- perhaps out of deference to Lin 's taste ; but accepted as symbolic of the old west , it need not interfere Avith the reader 's enjoyment of a good story .

		It is eight yeai 's since Mrs.
Ruth McEnery Stuart	PERSON	wrote ` Sonny , a Christmas Guest , ' and fourteen editions have been printed during the interval ; but the demand for that chai-ming bit of fiction is not yet exhausted .

		The reason for its lasting popularity is not far to seek ; `
Sonny	PERSON	' is full of real humor , delicate , but irresistible ; you laugh because you can not help it , and no matter how many times you have read the story , its freshness and sweetness still make their appeal .

		The latest edition of the book , published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is illustrated by Miss
Fanny Y. Cory	PERSON	, just the right person to vmderstand
Sonny	PERSON	and to depict him and his family in an original and entertaining way .

		There are fourteen illus - trations , besides a decorated initial for each chap - ter .

		Messrs.
Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's `
Luxembourg Library	ORGANIZATION	' is intended to furnish reprints of classic novels , which shall be durable and attractive and yet not too expensive to be within reach of a moder - ately filled purse .

		This purpose it fulfils very acceptably .

		The cloth bindings are simply and prettily ornamented , the typography clear , the paper of fair quality , and the illustrations in several cases of unusual interest and merit .

		The five volumes lately issued in this pleasing and inexpensive dress are
Jane Austen	PERSON	's ` Pride and Prejudice , ' with seventeen clever drawings in pen and ink ;
William Ware	PERSON	's `
Zenobia	LOCATION	, ' with the same number of photographs of the ruins of
Palmyra	LOCATION	;
Smollett	PERSON	's translation of `
Gil Bias	PERSON	, ' with illustrations taken from the French text ;
Charles Lever	PERSON	's `
Harry Lorrequer	PERSON	' with repro - ductions of the drawings by ` Phiz ' which appeared in the first edition ; and Bulwer-Lyt - ton 's ` Rienzi . '

		The present day flood of fiction is resulting in a neglect of many stories better worth while than some of the best selling books of the week or month .

		An attractive series of reprints , like those of the `
Luxembourg	LOCATION	' series , that helps to turn the tide and sends us back to make or renew acquaintance with old favorites , is of real service to the cause of good literature .

		It was a happy thought of the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		to publish the ` Maximes ' of La Rochefoucauld in an edition with French and English versions on opposite pages .

		It is entirely a matter of taste whether one enjoys the hard , worldly wis - dom of the ` Maximes , ' -- though Sainte-Beuve has said that there are moments in life when everybody gloats over them .

		But however strongly one may dissent from their cynical esti - mates of humanity , one can not but admire their lively precision and courteous , measured sim - plicity of expression .

		They ought to be re-read occasionally , if only as an antidote for exaggera - tion ; and for that purpose the present reprint is very suitable .

		Print and paper are good , the binding is pretty and durable , the end-papers appropriately decorated with thistles .

		The Eng - lish version of the maxims follows the French closely , and preser \ ` es its cautious suavity very well . '

		A good cheer book is the best year book , ' -- so runs the motto with which the preface to
Miss M. Allette Ayer	ORGANIZATION	's volume of ` Daily Cheer ' begins ; and we shall not be inclined to question the truth of the couplet .

		This particular ` Good Cheer ' book is made tip very much in the usual way , with a page of well-chosen extracts for each day in the year .

		The selections are all bright and cheerful , but there is plenty of variety in length , subject-matter , style , and authorship .

		The quotations on a page range in number from one to ten , but in every case a single thought runs through each day 's reading and unifies it .

		The pages of briefer quotations are particularly interesting , because of the novelty of finding such diverse authors as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Mrs. Mar - garet
Sangster	PERSON	,
Robert Browning	PERSON	, ` Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	, ' and
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	in symposivun upon the same subject .

		The chaste binding and taste - ful arrangement of the book will add materially to its value for the holiday purchaser .

		Several photographs , including a frontispiece portrait of Dr.

		` Christmas Eve on Lonesome ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the title story in a new volume by Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has kept closely within his chosen field , -- the lawless and primitive life of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountaineer ; and the feud is naturally the pivotal pK -RRB- int of most of the stories .

		However , the situations and types of character are so varied that there is no monotony about the book .

		The feud , as Mr.
Fox	PERSON	portrays it , has its pos - sibilities of humor as Avell as of pathos and bitter tragedy , and the strange nature of the moun - taineer has its kindlier and more generous side ; so the stories are cheerful reading .

		Of the five in the book , one besides the first has a Christmas theme , and the gay scarlet cover and eight illus - trations in color emphasize the holiday flavor .

		Mr.
Will Carleton	PERSON	's ever popular ' Over the Hill to the Poor-House , ' and its companion piece ` Over the Hill from the Poor-House , ' have been detached from the other ` Farm Ballads ' and made into a handsome Christmas book -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , with tinted illustrations and page decorations by Mr.
W. E. Mears	PERSON	, and an interesting preface by the author .

		In this preface Mr.
Carleton	PERSON	expresses becoming wonder over the interest that these two simple poems have aroused , and then gives an unaffected little history of the good he knows they have done and of the convincing proofs he has had that the critics who sneered at the tmreality of his work were quite in the wrong .

		` Business ' is the terse and somewhat anom - alous title of a small collection of slangy , cynical , and more or less witty epigrams , intended to embody the sordid philosophy of the modem bus - iness world in a form that will make it seem less sordid , at least for the moment .

		Mr.
L. de V. Matthewman	PERSON	is responsible for the aphorisms , and Mr.
Tom Fleming	PERSON	for the pictures .

		` The sureness of a sure thing is for the other man ' ; ` Do something if you must : do somebody if you can ' ; ` Incessant work tells -- on the worker ' ; ` Opportunity knocks once at every man 's door , but generally makes sure that he is not at home ' ; ` Whether the bull or the bear wins , it is a cold day for the lamb ' ; -- these will serve as samples of the quality of Mr.
Matthewman	PERSON	's epigrams , which gain considerably in point from Mr.
Flem	PERSON	- ing 's accompanying drawings .

Lippincott	PERSON	. -RRB-

		` Petals of Love for Thee ' -LRB-
Dodge Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a booklet of lyrics by
Edith Hall Orthwein	PERSON	.

		It is lavishly decorated with floral designs printed in glaring colors , and hav - ing , except in one or two cases , very little con - nection with the text .

		The poems are very faulty in technique , and are disfigured by unfortunate mannerisms .

		Altogether the volume belongs to a type of ` Holiday book ' which is fast being super - seded by finer workmanship and more literary value .

		Books for the
Youxg	ORGANIZATION	.

		I .

		The numerous volumes of the current season especially addressed to children exhibit in the main very much the same tendencies and standards as we have noted in former years .

		There is not as much of war and turmoil as there was a few years ago , and the gigantic struggle in
Asia	LOCATION	is almost unre - flected here -- possibly because so little is really known of the details .

		Books which make an appeal limited to boys and girls within certain narrow age limits seem to be on the increase .

		Books of adventure show no diminution in number , whether the adventure be connected with authentic history or not ; but there is a marked falling off in the number of stories dealing with historical epi - sodes not distinctly modern .

		There seems to be a decrease , also , in the way of older books of ascertained worth ; and at the other extreme of the literary scale there is a similar diminution as regards picture books with jingles showing an original turn of thought .

		On the whole , it is probably safe to say that the most encouraging feature in the children 's books of the present sea - son is the increasing depth of thought and serious - ness of purpose displayed -- though this is an impression rather than a statement susceptible of definite proof .

		Noticeable , also , is a steadily grow - ing skill in the handling of material , whether historical or human .

		But marked ability or strik - ing originality is not much in evidence .

		^ , .

		By all odds the most striking child 's inVeTforZ .

		`` ^ ^ ^ the season is the new edition of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	's ` Poems of Child - hood ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with illustrations in color by Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	.

		There is a delicacy of senti - ment and touch about these delightful illustrations that not only interprets the text , but gives it a refinement it did not possess before .

		The poems included in the volume are chosen from a wider range than heretofore , and on every account the book is one to cherish .

		-- Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	has performed a similar service for
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's ` The Heroes ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , although his illustrations , in color and black-and-white , lack the marked dis - tinction of Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's work .

		But the edition is none the less a worthy treatment of a worthy book .

		-- A pleasant revival of the forgotten work of a forgotten author , certain to meet with approval , is the new edition of
Frances Browne	PERSON	's ` Granny 's Wonderful Chair ' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett	PERSON	knew and loved the book as a child , but later on it passed from her , and only recently did she chance upon a copy .

		It had meant so much to her that she has felt impelled to set forth the fact in a really delicious preface to the present reprint which she calls ` The Lost Fairy Book , ' a better bit of writ - ing , possibly , than anything else in the volume .

		-- There is , almost inevitably one might say , a new edition this season of
Lewis Carroll	ORGANIZATION	's ` Alice 's Adventures in
Wonderland	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , for which Mr.
M. L. Kirk	PERSON	has prepared twelve fuU-pago pictures in color .

		Sir
John Tenniel	PERSON	's original illustrations are also included , and Mr.
Kirk	PERSON	has retained the spirit of these in his own drawings .

		Consequently the volume has a seemly congruity and reverence for tradition not to be found in other editions of the classic .

		-- Two more of
Louisa M. Alcott	PERSON	's books are republished , with admirable pictures by Miss
Harriet Roosevelt Richards	PERSON	, in
Messrs. Little	LOCATION	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of that sterling author .

		` Eight Cousins ; or , The Aunt - .

		380 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Hill ' and ` Rose in
Bloom	PERSON	' are the titles of this year 's additions , and in all respects the volumes are fully up to the high standard set by their predecessors .

		-- ` Fairy Tales by
Dumas	PERSON	' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is the prosaic title chosen for the volume con - taining Mr.
Harry A. Spurr	PERSON	's translation of the
Aramis	PERSON	story , ` When Pierrot Was Young , ' and ` The
Countess Bertha	PERSON	's Honey Feast . '

		Mr.
Harry Eoundtree	PERSON	's illustrations show a fine appreciation of the significance of the stories , and the book makes one wish that the delicious imagination of
Dumas	PERSON	might have expressed itself more fre - quently in works of the kind .

		--
Paul de Musset	PERSON	' a ` Mr.
Wind	PERSON	and Madam Rain , ' as translated years ago by Miss
Emily Makepeace	PERSON	and illustrated by
Charles Bennett	PERSON	, is now reproduced in handsome form by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The fanciful supersti - tions of the Breton peasantry and an interpolated puppet show will be recalled as making up the groundwork of this delightful tale .

		-- What is often characterized as the Italian ` Alice in Won - derland ' has been rendered into English by Mr.
Walter Samuel Cramp	PERSON	from the original of
Carlo Collodi	ORGANIZATION	, under the title of ` The Adventures of Pinocchio ' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		The titular hero is a wooden marionette , and Mr.
Charles Copeland	PERSON	has pictured him in complete accordance with the spirit of the text .

		-- ' Red Cap Tales , Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North ,
Which Theft	ORGANIZATION	is Humbly Acknowledged by
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	' is the wording on the title page of an attractive book -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with illustrations in color by Mr.
Simon Harmon Vedder	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	has taken a number of stories dealing with gnomes and fairies from five of the
Waverley	LOCATION	novels , sim - plified them somewhat by rewriting with a juvenile audience in view , and left his readers to obtain the effect of the new grouping .

		-- In a manner somewhat analogous , Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	has produced ` The Story of Little
Paul	PERSON	' and ` The Story of Little
Peter	PERSON	' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , as new volumes in the ` Famous Children of Literature ' series .

		Dickens 's ` Dombey and Son ' provides the material for the former book , and Captain Mar - ryat 's `
Peter Simple	PERSON	' for the latter .

		Both are examples of what might be called predigested literature .

		-- A new version of the old story of the Argonauts has been made by Prof.
D. O. S. Lowell	PERSON	, of the
Roxbury Latin School	ORGANIZATION	, and published under the title of ` Jason 's Quest ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with illustrations by Mr.
C. W. Reed	PERSON	.

		The book is deserving of praise in every respect .

Heze	PERSON	- kiah
Butterworth	PERSON	's ` Little Metacomet ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This account of the son of
Philip	LOCATION	, last of the Wam - panoags , is for quite small children .

		Exiled by the English after his father 's death at
Mount Hope	LOCATION	, the short history of the little prince is told in its relations to a family of white children which he befriended .

		-- Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	takes up a well known episode in the French and Indian War of two centuries ago in ` The Boy Captive of Old Deerfield ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Her story is written with painstaking intention to teach the comfortable children of to-day something of the sufferings of their predecessors .

		-- The southern colonies come in for somewhat belated treatment in two books by Miss
Annie M. Barnes	PERSON	: ' A Lass of
Dorchester	LOCATION	, ' in which the scene is laid in the
Carolinas	LOCATION	in
1702	DATE	, and ` The Laurel Token : A Story of the
Yamassee Uprising	ORGANIZATION	, ' dealing with the plantation at
Goose Creek	ORGANIZATION	in
1714	DATE	.

		There is wide field for the investigator here , and
Miss Barnes	PERSON	has made good use of her manifest opportunities .

		Both books are published by
Messrs. Lee & Shep	ORGANIZATION	- ard .

		-- The fourth volume of Mr.
Edward Strate	PERSON	- meyer 's ` Colonial Series ' is called ` On the Trail of
Pontiac	LOCATION	; or , The Pioneer Boys of the
Ohio	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and brings the history down to the last French and Indian war in the eighteenth cen - tury .

		Characters from previous books in the series reappear here , and the treatment of the Indian tribes is more humane than the settlers themselves were accustomed to accord them .

		-- Revolutionary times in their inception find mention episodically in Miss
Helen M. Cleveland	PERSON	's ` Stories of Brave Old Times : Some
Pen Pictures of Scenes Which Took Place Previous	ORGANIZATION	to , or Connected with , the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Revolution ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The short stories are picturesque and full of the turmoil of the times , leaving a curious sense of the inadequacy of the struggle to maintain the liberties so painfully acquired .

		Photographs of the localities mentioned and numerous pen drawings illustrate the book .

		-- Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, one of the best of American writ - ers on such topics , presents a graphic picture of
New York	LOCATION	just after the declaration of indepen - dence in ` Dorothy 's Spy ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A small patriot and a British spy lend interest to the story , and Mr.
Clyde O. DeLand	PERSON	's illustrations are bet - ter than the average .

		-- Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	makes one of
Washington	LOCATION	's couriers the prota - gonist in ` The Rider of the Black Horse ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , involves a charming girl in the hero 's fortunes , sets a villainous ` Cowboy ' against them both after they have jointly tricked him , and makes of it all a very good story indeed , one of the best he has ever written .

		-- Of the same year ,
1777	DATE	, with the scene in
Vermont	LOCATION	rather than
New York	LOCATION	, is Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	's ` The Minute Boys of the
Green Mountains	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Two boys of sixteen and an old hunter of the Leatherstocking type work together for independence in an entirely whole - hearted manner .

		-- From the battle-field of

Louisiana	LOCATION	Pur - chase is the period covered by Mr.
William C. Sprague	PERSON	's ` The

Douglas	PERSON	's ' A Little Girl in Old
Chicago	LOCATION	, ' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , opens in the year
1812	DATE	, though the story is carried down past the time of the Col - umbian Exposition .

		It is an interesting story of wonderful development and accomplishment .

		-- Mr.
Thomas J. L. McManus	PERSON	, whose younger days were passed near
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry , was one of those who were actually in the mountain schoolhouse at the time of its capture .

		He has written , in ` The Boy and the Outlaw ' -LRB-
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an impressive account of
John Brown	PERSON	's raid and the weeks imme - diately thereafter .

		The book is illustrated in color .

		-- The very opening of the Civil War , while the Confederates were attempting to capture President
Lincoln	PERSON	and his cabinet , is the period of Mr.
Wil	PERSON	-
liam O. Stoddard	PERSON	's ` Long Bridge Boys ' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , and the youthful hero is made to save the govern - ment by a clever bit of detective work .

		-- ' The Three Prisoners ' -LRB-
Barnes	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Mr.
W. H. Shelton	PERSON	, is also a Civil War story , covering a longer period of time than the book just named , and detailing the engrossing particulars of one of the narrowest of escapes .

		-- `
Daniel Webster	PERSON	for Young Americans ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a volume edited , with an introduction and notes , by Prof.
Charles F. Richardson	PERSON	.

Edwin P. Whipple	PERSON	's essay on `
Webster	PERSON	as a Master of English Style ' make up the contents .

		There are a number of pertinent
1904	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 portraits and other pictures .

		-- ' The American Boy 's Life of
Theodore Eoosevelt	PERSON	' -LRB- Lee & Shep - ard -RRB- depends for its interest rather upon the spec - tacular than the significant episodes in the career of the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is writ - ten by Mr.

Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the spirit of the Sagas is alive in the work .

		The period is the one of transition between the old religion and the new Christianity , and elements of both appear through the narrative .

		The pictures , by Mr.
Bernard J. Rosenmeyer	PERSON	, are drawn with spirit and historical fidelity .

		-- ` The Crusaders : A Story of the War for the Holy Sepulchre ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a well considered work by the Rev.

Richard	PERSON	the Fear - less : A Tale of the

		-- It is a baby princess ,
Henrietta	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	, with whom the interests of the heroine of `
Elinor Arden	PERSON	, Royalist ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- become finally identified .

		Adventure in ^ '' `` 1 ' ^ , ^ , '' '' ^ adventure based only inci - many lands .

		dentally upon historical events are never devoid in the nature of things of a certain sort of sensationalism , though there is a great difference in both the quality and quantity of the sensations involved as well as of veritable fact .

		` The Blue Dragon : A Story of Recent Adventures in
China	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Kirk Mun	PERSON	- roe , is a combination of sensational romantic inci - dent with historical or biographical incident , cul - minating in the relief of the beleaguered legations in Peking during the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising .

		It is note - worthy for its sympathy with the yellow race , although quite devoid of prejudice in favor of the Chinese .

		-- Of another sort is Mr.
E. P. Weaver	PERSON	's ` The Search ' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , in which a courageous English boy travels from
London	LOCATION	to western

Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in the

Howard R. Garis	PERSON	's ` Isle of Black Fire ' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , in which a shipload of men and boys set out to bring home a great piece of rich radium ore from one of the islands of the sea .

Mary Bourchier Safford	PERSON	's ` The Wandering Twins : A Story of Labrador ' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		In this almost unknown corner of the world a boy and girl are set down to seek their father .

		A thrilling rescue from the perils of the frozen North ends the tale .

		The book is by Captain
Ralph Bone	PERSON	- hill -LRB- Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The fighting of sailors rather than soldiers , and the deeds of those that go down into the sea in ships , occupy the attention of various authors .

		The list of books in this field may well be headed by Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's ` Stories of Discovery as Told by
Discoverers	ORGANIZATION	' and ` Stories of Adventure as Told by Adventurers ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , now reprinted in attractive form after several decades of useful - ness .

		-- Of the same sort , but with the attention given to marauding rather than to the uses of peace , is Miss
Jessie Peabody Frothingham	PERSON	's ` Sea - Wolves of Seven Shores ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		From the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, and from the
Barbary States	LOCATION	to
North America	LOCATION	, is the range of this most interesting and exciting book .

		-- The last of the Henty books , ` By Conduct and Courage : A Story of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's Days ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , will be laid down with a feeling of real regret that so notable a figure in the development of children 's stories should hereafter be silent .

		The book is as good as most of its predecessors , although both its brevity and abrupt close lead to the supposition that , whil * Tales of the sea .

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
H. S. Huntington	PERSON	, an unusu - ally good story .

		The scene is laid upon a rocky islet near
Martinique	LOCATION	, which the British seized dur - ing the Napoleonic struggles of 1802-3 , and armed , manned , and commissioned as a sloop-of-war .

		It was at last surrendered after a desperate defense against an overwhelming force ; but the boy-hero is permitted to escape as the bearer of despatches to Nelson regarding the coming of
Villaneuve	ORGANIZATION	's fleet .

		-- The international interest now growing so common is very evident in Mr.
F. H. Costello	PERSON	's ` Nelson 's Yankee Boy : The Adventures of a
Plucky Young New Englander	ORGANIZATION	at Trafalgar and Elsewhere , and Later in the War of
1812	DATE	' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

Decatur	LOCATION	' after its gallant capture of the `
Dominica	LOCATION	, ' The thrilling pictures are by Mr.
W. H. Dunton	PERSON	, and the book is altogether an exciting one .

		-- With the interest divided between a whaler , a trading vessel , and that heroic warship , the ` Essex , ' Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's ' A Midshipman in the Pacific ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a volume teeming with action , some of it savoring of exaggeration , A midshipman is impressed unwillingly into the service of a British whaling vessel .

		Shipwrecked in mid-ocean , he and a companion are rescued by the ship sent by
Astor	PERSON	to the mouth of the

Otto von Bruneck	PERSON	.

		The book sets forth the life and adventures of a youthful protege of an imperial personage , who eventually wins his way to a commission after doing gallant service in the
African Hinterland	LOCATION	.

		It is a well written and interesting story .

		Perhaps the most interesting of the especHally season 's stories for boys is told by the popular Japanese author ,
Gensai Murai	PERSON	, and his book , translated by
Tasao Yoshida	PERSON	, is named ` Kibun Daizin ; or .

		From Shark-Boy to Merchant Prince ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story is a true one , dating back to the
seventeenth century	DATE	, and showing that at that time there was a stronger resemblance between Japanese ideas of success and those current in
America	LOCATION	to-day than is generally supposed .

		But the hero is animated by the pre - cepts of a worthy religion to an extent not common in the Occident , and his reputation is good in more than the commercial sense .

		-- It can hardly be said that anything in the way of invention is improb - able at this time , so that Mr.
Alvah Milton Kerr	PERSON	's ` Two Young Inventors : The Story of the Flying Boat ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- avoids to a considerable extent the criticism of improbability .

		A cyclonu and a forest fire are incidents in the tale , which ends in the production of a boat suitable for either air or water .

		-- A wholesome account of the life led by a
New York	LOCATION	lad while in the country for his health is contained in ` The White Crystals ' -LCB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the title being derived from the discovery of salt on the farm where the lad is staying with his uncle and cousin .

Martha James	PERSON	, and deals with the problem of an orphaned lad who is left penniless by his father 's death and has to make his own way .

		He is sturdy , manly , and self - reliant , and at the end wins a place in the world .

		-- It would be hard to imagine a boy who begins life at a greater disadvantage than the small hero of Mr.
William Wallace Cooke	PERSON	's `
Wilby	ORGANIZATION	's Dan ' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , for he has a miser for a grandfather , u criminal for a father , and a poor-house charge for a sister .

		But he manages to get ahead , once he finds kindly treatment .

		-- There is an account of the breaking-up of the reign of terror in
San Francisco	LOCATION	in ` The Young Vigilantes : A Story of
California	LOCATION	Life in the Fifties ' -LRB-

		The Else of a Nobody ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- depends for its climax upon the familiar device of restoration to a long-lost family of means and respectability , but in this case not until the boy had been able to show of what good stuff he was made .

		It is written by Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	.

		-- Miss
Helen Dawes Brown	PERSON	, in ' A Book of Little Boys ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , has depictea fourteen episodes of life as the small boy lives it .

Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A crippled child , son to a widowed father , develops great talent as a draughtsman .

		Just when everything has grown darkest , the sky brightens and the world becomes gay again .

Dec. 16	DATE	, A History of Science By
HENRY SMITH WILLIAMS	PERSON	, B.Sc ,
M.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D .

		Author of '' The Story of
Nineteenth Century Science	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The History of the Art of Writing , '' editor of `` The Historian 's History of the World , '' etc. .

		IN FIVE VOLUMES Profusely Illustrated with Portraits of Famous Scientists , Diagrams , Facsimiles , Pictures , etc. .

		A HISTORY OF SCIENCE is the story of the origin and development of scientific thought , discovery , and invention from the earliest times to the present day .

		It traces the growth of ideas from the first vague dreamings of pre-historic man down to the precise inductions of the twentieth-century scien - tist in his laboratory .

		From this view-point the story of hitman progress presents the most wonderful and interesting spectacle ^ -- a chapter of man 's history that has never before been written in its entirety .

		The work is scientifically accurate in statement and yet devoid of all technicalities throughout .

		It will fascinate the general reader while commanding the respect of the most critical of students .

		There is no straining after the spectacular or picturesque at the expense of truth , yet so fascinating is the story in itself , so wide the opportunity for the play of the scientific imagination , that the narrative has all tlie charm , attraction , and compelling power of romance .

		NOTES 434 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 435 BRICKS WITH STRAW .

		We were discussing recently the multiplica - tion of new editions of old authors which is go characteristic a feature of our present-day industry of book-making .

		Hardly less char - acteristic is the busy way in which we are engaged in making new books , in form , out of the literary accumulations of the past ; these condensations , rearrangements , anthologies , compilations , and special series seem to be the result of a determined effort to give the great - 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, est possible availability to the literature already existing , whether or not we make any appre - ciable addition to its amount .

		If we may liken the bondage of the modem literary hack to his publisher with that of the chosen tribe of old to their Egyptian taskmasters , we can not fairly claim for him that he is forced to make his bricks without straw ; on the contrary , he is provided in abundance with straw of the toughest quality , which a very common sort of clay will cement into the most serviceable of briclvs .

		Changing the metaphor for a moment , we are reminded of the way in which the temples and palaces , the aqueducts and amphitheatres , of the ancient world served for the decadent following centuries as storehouses of building material already quarried and shaped for use .

		However much we may regret this destruction of monuments by the barbarian successors of the ancients who erected them , and deplore the return to baser uses of the marble blocks which once embodied the noblest ideals of a vanished civilization , we must agree that something is to be said for the utilitarian aspect of the vandal - ism .

		The men responsible for it had much need of the walls and dwellings which they built - ^ vith these fragments of old glory , and no need at all of the structures which they so ruthlessly destroyed .

		Something like this apology may be made for our modem builders of books out of the hewn blocks of the classics , but the two cases , parallel for figurative pur - poses , become divergent in the light of fact , for it is happily true that we may construct any number of modem books from material offered by the ancient monuments of literature , and still preserve these monuments intact for the joy of those who cherish them .

		A certain detachment of spirit , and a certain degree of freedom from the pressure of modem life , are the conditions precedent to the full enjoyment of the great masterpieces of litera - ture .

		Happy is the man who can at all times command this freedom and this detachment ; measurably happy is also the man who knows even at intervals this ' blessed mood ' of spiritual emancipation from perplexity and care .

		But there are many men who would almost never come into contact with the noblest literature were it accessible only upon such terms , and for these the humble service of the compiler or the anthologist is not to be despised .

		He , at least , points out the path to the heights , and the glimpse of their distant splendor , caught for the moment , may lighten not a little the burden of the day , and remain an inspiration to keep the soul alive in the most sluggish and suffocating atmosphere .

		N'evertheless , in spite of its obvious useful - ness , the practice of making books out of other books appears to be overdone .

		We have had something like a surfeit of libraries of universal literature , and more than a surfeit of special anthological compilations .

		Of these enter - prises , large and small , much more of good than is actually possible might be said were they honestly carried out , with an eye single to their ideal purpose , whatever it might be .

		That they are not so executed becomes only too evident upon examination .

		They are books made to sell , and they illustrate all the com - mercial complications of this aim .

		To the genuine lover of literature they are anathema , because they permit the sublime to jostle with the vulgar , the worthy with the meretricious , and the pure gold of the artist with the brum - magem of the charlatan .

		What must be the judgment of a man with any standards at all upon a collection of oratory which includes both Demosthenes and Mr.
Albert Beveridge	PERSON	, a collection of essays which includes both
Bacon	PERSON	and Mr.
Edward Bok	PERSON	, a collection of poetry which includes both
Virgil	PERSON	and Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, a collection of music which includes both
Bach	PERSON	and Mr.
Eeginald Delvoven	PERSON	?

		Yet with such strange bedfellows are the great made acquainted through the craft of the callous modem compiler and the commercial publisher at whose behest he plies his conscienceless calling .

		If the aim of these incongnious juxtaposi - tions were simply historical , which it is not , they might be justified as startling object-les - sons in the decline of modern literary taste .

		To the mental vision of proper adjustment the popular writers of the day provide horrible examples in the contrast offered by their tinsel trappings to the sterling ornaments of the approved artists .

		But no such instructive pur - pose is to be detected in the heterogeneous com - pilations to which our attention is so insistently called by advertisements and circular appeals and the persuasions of smooth-tongued agents .

		These devices of publicity are deliberately employed to beguile unwary persons into the purchase of sets of books which confuse the sense of literary values , and encourage the far too prevalent delusion that frothy and vapid writers , who happen for the moment to enjoy the favor of an indiscriminating public , have some standing in the literary areopagus .

		Thus the influence of these anthological collections is vicious in so far as it sets the worthless upon the level of the excellent , and it is still further vicious in the encouragement which it gives to the reading of snippets as a substitute for the reading of complete works .

		Books of this description are incitements to a sham and superficial culture ; about the only thing that may be urged in their behalf is that they bring some fragments of good literature within the

		THE DIAL , 413 ken of readers who might otherwise go through life without coming into any contact at all with the masters .

		But however serious the exceptions that may be taken to the multiplication of libraries of literature and collections of ' elegant extracts / the work of producing them will go merrily on , for the plain reason that they meet an exist - ing demand .

		It is a demand fostered by the hurry and the nervous tension and the wasted energies of the age in which we live .

		We have a large reading public that battons on the moor because the mountain pasture seems too dif - ficult of access , that prefers the gossip of house - maids and stable-boys to the converse of kings and queens because it would feel uncomfortable in the presence of royalty .

		We are confronted by a condition , not a theor -RCB- ^ , and we must make the best of it .

		And if we choose to construct our intellectual habitations from the bricks of the anthologists , there is some slight consola - tion in the fact that these bricks are not wholly made of common clay , that they are not with - out some Avholesome admixture of strengthening fibre .

		THREE BOOKS ON SHAKESPEARE .

		Whether or not Mr.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	's book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has achieved the reputation it deserves , I can not say .

		At any rate it has now half completed its nonage ; it is through with the perils of teething and infantile diseases ; it has reached the time when it naturally begins to put on the graces and vivacities of youth ; intelligent people can take an interest in it .

		The work is remarkable in two respects .

		First , for its criticism , which , barring
Lowell	PERSON	's great essay and the brilliant dashes of
Eichard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	into this field , is the best Shakespearian interpretation we have had in our country ^ ; and , second , for its biographical theories , which are singularly anticipative of those held by the great Danish critic ,
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Wen	PERSON	-
dell	ORGANIZATION	's book indeed might almost stand as a pre - liminary study for
Brandes	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		To a cer - tain extent , ever since the chronology of Shakes - peare 's plays has been tolerably settled , these theories have been in the air .

		The great breaks , almost amounting to a solution of continuity between the happiness of the work of Shakes - peare 's youthful prime , the black pessimism and blank despair of his tremendous tragic epoch , and the renewed peace , though ruffled with the swell of the preceding storm , of his final period , are too apparent not to have led many students to seek an explanation for such changes in the facts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own life .

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	is at his best in his treatment of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tragedies .

		One might say that he has read them in the light of
Jonathan Ed	PERSON	- wards and found in them an essential
Calvin	PERSON	- ism .

		In his view Shakespeare at his greatest was mad , -- or , at least , only saved from mad - ness by his artistic instinct .

		This madness was partially caused by his relations with women , his conviction of their trivialty and baseness , and partially by his contemplation of the whole problem of evil in the universe .

		Certainly Shakespeare 's attitude towards this problem is different from that of the other three world - poets who may claim equalit -RCB- ^ with him .

		In Homer the problem is put aside .

		Things are as they are : the gods have appointed them ; the gods themselves are subject to Fate ; it is not worth while to make a fuss ; let us fight and enjoy and put off death , the only irretrievable ill , as long as possible .

		In Dante the world is but a welter of gloom , a shadow flung upward from the fires of hell .

		But Faith can find a path through those shadows and these fires .

		Man - kind may be saved by faith .

		Goethe is the real Protestant poet .

		Evil is everywhere , and no one can keep his feet from it .

		But man may be saved by Works .

		Dig a canal or make two blades of grass grow where one grew before and all vnll be forgiven .

		Shakespeare has neither the acquiescence of Homer , the faith of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, nor the utilitarian tolerance of Goethe .

		He struggles fearfully to find a footing in the abyss of the world .

		Sometimes he is a Pyrrhonist , and says that nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so .

		Sometimes , as Mr.
Wen	PERSON	- dell suggests , he is plunged in Calvinism .

		This world is bad and there is a worse hereafter .

		For nearly all , inevitable damnation awaits .

		The best we can hope is oblivion , -- ^ what the sleeping rocks dream of . '

		But at other times I think he rises to an older and more primeval creed , -- the philosophy of Zoroaster .

		Good and Evil , equal gods , contend in the world and throughout the infinite ; and the strife is eter - nal .

		There is one opinion of Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	's con - cerning the tragedies with which I particularly agree .

		It is that ''
Macbeth	PERSON	' is Shakespeare 's most perfect , has profoundest piece .

		It has not the personal appeal of ' Hamlet ' ; it has not the all-culminating power of '
King Lear	PERSON	. '

		But in its artistry , -- its pictorial beauty and grandeur , its absolute keeping , its clash of character , the swiftness and crash of events , it is unequalled .

		By reason of its concentration and reserve , it ds
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's one drama in the manner of the Greeks .

		And the scene of the Knocking at the Gate and the
Porter	PERSON	's speech -- a scene which , marvellous to say ,
Coleridge	PERSON	thought interpolated and offered to prove none of Shake - speare 's -- stands , with the scene of the mur - der of Agamemnon , at the head of all tragic situations in literature .

		More than this , * Mac - beth ' is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's one mythological drama .

		414 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, In it he strides across the borders of the visible world and seats himself on the ebon throne of
Night	TIME	.

		He summons the Parcse to his side , and sends them in new forms to entangle the wills and perplex the acts of man .

		Dreams and omens , too , he sends to shake mortal assurance .

		The piece is a miracle of art . '

		Othello / I think , is on an altogether lower plane .

		Almost in proportion as Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has succeeded in his interpretation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tragic work , he has failed , or so it seems to me , in his criticism of the comedies of the poet 's golden years .

		Some distrust of romance , some suspicion of joy , some fear of passion , seem inherent in all the
New England	LOCATION	writers .

		The glacial epoch still lingers on the banks of the
Charles	LOCATION	.

		The Puritans have an appreciation of all that is serious and great , but they have nearly as fierce a hatred of pleasure as the Friends .

		An old
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	acquaintance of mine once confided to me that he had had , all his life , an unconquerable desire to write poetry , but that his religion frowned upon this as a sinful indulgence , and for a long time he had refrained .

		At last he came to the conclusion that the pains and penalties of metrical com - position would be a fair off-set for its pleasures , and he gave way to his passion .

		Soon , however , he acquired such facility in verse that there was no longer any penance in writing it , and he felt that he must stop .

		It occurred to him , then , that sonnets were a very difficult form of poetry , and he decided to write nothing but sonnets .

		The fatal fluency came to him again , and his conscience compelled him to another remove .

		From that time forth he wrote only sonnets in acrostic .

		This story is not quite apropos to Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	, but it illustrates the antagonism which many minds feel towards art which is purely pleasurable .

		And
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's comedies are a palace of pleasure , -- a domain of pure joy such as exists nowhere else in liter - ature .

		The supreme master of clouds and storms , the wielder of lightning and thunder , builds up in them a sky of pure sunshine over an earth of dappled shade .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	somewhere contrasts the turbid grandeur of the poets of the North with the clear outlines and pure colors of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sons of song .

		The distinction is hardly a happy one .

		There is plenty of turbid grandeur , if you choose to call it so , in
Aeschylus	LOCATION	and
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, and there are nowhere -- not the Nausicaa of Homer or the Syracusan women of Theocritus -- figures outlined so clearly , colored so richly , so full of naive charm and studied enchantment , as the young girls of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's comedies .

		The ladies of the Decameron , the heroines of
Ariosto	PERSON	and Tasso , are limp and pale and spiritless beside the gracious guests of
Arden	LOCATION	's glade or
Illyria	LOCATION	's court or
Belmont	ORGANIZATION	's garden .

		That our magician of the North should have beaten his
Mediterranean	LOCATION	rivals out of their own field of grace and beauty and delight explains the secret preference which many of us feel for his com - edies over his greater tragic work .

		We have the same feeling for them that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	had for
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Shakespeare 's comedies are indeed the
Italy	LOCATION	of literature , -- a sunny world wherein all our longings may be satisfied .

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	considers that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's last plays , ' Pericles , ' ' Cymbeline , ' ' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , ' and ' The Tempest , ' show an exhaustion , as though the great creator 's force was spent , his vein worked out .

		He supports this liiesis with much ingenuity , but it seems rather fanci - ful .

		When we consider the freshness of the pastoral scenes in ' The Winters Tale , ' the vitality of
Imogen	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's most perfect woman , when we think that in one play , ' The Tempest , ' he put his most spiritual phantasy ,
Ariel	PERSON	, and his most prodigious piece of absolute creation ,
Caliban	LOCATION	, a pure anticipated cognition of our modern ideas of the primitive man , we can hardly grant any failing or falling off .

		Change of mood , change of direction , there was , but no declination in genius .

		And this leads us to the poignant thought that perhaps the latest and greatest of Shakespeare 's works may have perished .

		The indifference if not hostility of the people by whom he was surrounded in
Stratford	LOCATION	, his early and unexpected death , the burning of New Place and his house and theatre in
London	LOCATION	, may have conspired to rob the world of the captain jewels in his carcanet .

		There was possibly an interval of five years between the date of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's last known play and the time of his death .

		It is impossible that his mind and pen should have been idle during all this period . '

		You might as well put the kettle on the fire and tell it not to boil , as forbid me to work , ' said
Scott	PERSON	, a much older and far more broken man than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Well , we shall never know , and our loss is only a conjectural one .

		The Prince of Conjecture in regard to Shake - speare is
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		His book seems to me the most magnificent monument reared to Shakespeare since the glimpses and fragments of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's criticism were given to the world .

		He starts with the frank avowal of belief that the biography of Shakespeare can be deduced from the works .

		It is hardly to be questioned that the moods and emotions of a writer can to some extent be arrived at from his writings .

		That the outward events of a man 's life are mirrored in his books is a more doubtful con - clusion .

		It might take us too far .

		A future historian might be forced to believe that Victor Hugo had served in the galleys or that
Dickens	PERSON	had been imprisoned in the
Marshalsea	LOCATION	.

		Imag - ination and creative power may make an
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		415 immense show out of a small data of experience .

		It requires only a sHght obstruction to make an oyster secrete a pearl .

		Yet experience and obstruction there must be or you do not get the results .

		Goethe said that all his works were a long confession of his life .

		And in Shake - speare 's case the changes of mood as his work progressed are beyond parallel in any other poet .

		The heights of happiness to which they rise , the depths of despair to which they plunge , the final recoil to a middle state of tolerance and resignation , make it all but certain that in a measure they reflect their author 's experi - ence of life .

		Most authors are set to one tune ; they are optimists or pessimists from the start , -- idealists or realists .

		But Shakespeare starts with an optimism which sees a soul of goodness in things evil , and then wraps himself in such a mantle of gloom that
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and
Leo	PERSON	- pardi seem like gaudy garmented jesters beside him .

		For a time he paints only ideal pictures of love and truth , and then he turns to such descriptions of the brothels and the stews as
Zola	ORGANIZATION	has hardly equalled .

		This revulsion of feeling in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, this toppling of his mind almost over into madness ,
Brandes	PERSON	attrib - utes to three causes : his disappointment about women , his knowledge of the rottenness of the court and society about him , and the defeat of his ambition by unequal rivals .

		Brandes thinks that there must have come to Shakespeare at this period of his career a mighty feeling of self-confidence , the egotism of a supreme master ; that he haughtily compared himself with the men outstripping him in popular acclaim in his own art , and with the other intellects of the time , -- and he knew he was their master .

		All this sounds reasonable and probable enough .


Georg Brandes	PERSON	's conception is not authenti - cated history , but better than any other it satis - fies our sense of what Shakespeare the man must have been .

		Brandes accepts Hamlet a `` Shakespeare 's personal representative among his congress of creations , and devotes much space to the Danish Prince .

		He makes Hamlet out the most accomplished figure in literature , and rather combats the idea that he was weak and undecided .

		He quotes , indeed , the opinion of another critic who claims that Hamlet was a magnificent man of action who did all he ought to have done .

		Really it is something like the case of
Saladin	PERSON	's scimetar , which could not do the work of
Richard	PERSON	's sword , but which , nevertheless , was a wonderful weapon .

		It has always seemed to me a great absurdity that we should grumble at Hamlet because he did not kill his Uncle before break - fast after his interview with the Ghost .

		Even so great a critic as
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	wishes to displace Hamlet as the hero of his own story and substi - tute -- whom ?

		Horatio !

		Horatio was a per - fectly respectable person , who probably i-ose to be captain of the guard or commander of a Danish fishing fleet , but who , it is safe to say , would never have been heard of except for his connection with his great friend .

		There are three orders of minds in the world , -- the active , the contemplative , and the creative .

		The men of action rush about like cheese-mites : they make a great bustle , but a large half of what they do is not worth doing .

		Bismarck , a typical man of action , confessed before his death that he thought he had done more harm than good in the world .

		The contemplative men really possess the world , but they possess it mainly for their own delight , and they are of little practical use , save as passive examples of good - ness .

		The creative minds model and remake mankind ; in a hundred different ways they impress the world , and their signatures are stamped deeper and endure longer than thoee - of the men of action or affairs .

		To me - it , seems that the mind of Hamlet was distiisctly of the creative cast .

		Poet , philosopher , critic , _ reformer , he only needed time to blaze out a ; prodigy .

		Every one around him felt his power , , though his modesty disguised or distrusted itt The eternal thing in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's play is that it is the biography of a young genius .

		His ; ; hesitation in taking his revenge was mainly due - to his inexperience and his too great nobility .

		A huffing captain in one of
Dumas	PERSON	's novels utters a sentence which is the key to Hamlet 's original irresolution .

		The bully is talking to a young gentleman who draws back from a certain enterprise because his conscience would be compromised therein , and he tells him , ' The - man who can not lie , can not act . '

		Haralet is so constituted that a lie is almost death to him , , and when he sees the necessity of fighting the - world with its own weapons he is awkward and ' stumbling in the extreme .

		But he becomes stronger in worldliness as he goes on , and he - ends in a whirlwind of revenge .

		To turn from
Georg Brandes	PERSON	to Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	is to descend from art to business .

		It is like leaving a theatre where ' Parsifal ' has been - performed and going out into the garish , brawl - ing street .

		It is like riding one moment through the air with
Phaethon	PERSON	in his fiery chariot , and the next bumping along the ground or being ducked in the cold waters of the sea .

		As a compendium of the known facts about Shake - speare and his surroundings the book is admir - able ; learning , industry , and talent make it a work not to be superseded .

		As a study of a great poet it is , to speak frankly , deplorable - Mr.
Lee	PERSON	treats Shakespeare much as thoug ' h the poet had been a manufacturer of woolen yams in
Lancashire	LOCATION	or a breeder of prize sheep - on the
Cotswolds	LOCATION	.

		Among a good many recent 416 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, English critics there is a tendency towards prosaic views of literary idols , a disposition to take them down a peg .

		This attitude is very apparent in the work of Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		It is apparent in a good deal of Mr ,
Morley	PERSON	's criticism .

		It was largely the stock in trade of the brilliant
Bagehot	PERSON	.

		And to a certain extent it is justifiable and necessary .

		At a time when the literature of the nineteenth century was largely becoming , in
Freeman	ORGANIZATION	's phreise , ' chatter about
Harriet	PERSON	/ such a reaction was a healthy sign .

		But it has probably gone far enough , and • ought never to have been applied to Shake - speare .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's biography is largely on the lines of Bagehofs clever but quite Philistine • essay on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was well enough to prove that the poet was a good man of business , ` but it was hardly worth while to give the impression that he was nothing else .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	strips Shakespeare of all the glamor that legend • or conjecture have raised around him .

		He reduces him personally to the least dimensions .

		Even in utterly unimportant matters he insists • on the lowest terms .

		For instance ,
Brandes	PERSON	, ^ following Knight , makes the young Shakespeare .

		ride up to
London	LOCATION	and there sell his horse .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	says he walked .

		How does he know ?

		If , .

		as tradition holds , his first employment in Lon - don had to do with horses ,
Brandes	PERSON	' story is more likely to be right .

		One of the most acute and erudite chapters in Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's study has to do with the sonnets .

		His deduction that they are mainly or largely imaginative and impersonal is unconvincing .

		It is much the same question as to whether Shakespeare put his experience into the plays ; and the judgment must be the same , -- that of course he did .

		The events in both cases may ibe imaginary , but the mood is real .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	also decides that the ' Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	' of
Thomas Thorpe	PERSON	's dedication was only the collector of the sonnets , not the inspirer .

		Why the pub - lisher should have wished the mere gatherer-up of manuscript poems the ` immortality promised by our ever-living poet ' is unexplained .

		In all the discussions of the sonnets I can not recall that any critic has ever noted their immense ` disparity in literary merit .

		There are , I should - say , about fifty-five of them of great excellence , tmany of which are supreme stars in our sonnet literature .

		The remaining hundred or so are mot above the level of the mass of Elizabethan fionneteering .

		Such a disproportion of bad to good exists in no other admitted work of Shake - speare , and I am inclined to think that whoever gathered the sonnets together swept in a number written by other hands .

		This very thing hap - pened in more tlian one publication given forth under
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name , and why not in the .

		< ; ase of the sonnets ?

		* ISTot even * Praeterita ' or ' Fors ' brings the reader into so intimate contact with
Ruskin	PERSON	as do his letters to Professor
Charles Eliot	PERSON	Nor - ton , which now , edited and annotated by Mr. ^ N ^ orton , and enriched with illustrations and facsimiles , are published in two handsome Tolumes .

		As the editor says in his preface , '' No other series of his letters extended oinbroken over so long a term of years , or was likely to possess so much autobiographical interest , -- comparatively little , indeed , as a Tecord of events , but much as a record of moods and mental conditions .

		As a picture of char - acter the letters as a whole were unique . '

		Selec - tion and excision have of course been necessary ; ■ but the series as published extends , with no wide gaps , from the beginning of this long and • close friendship in
1855	DATE	down to
1887	DATE	, when
Ruskin	PERSON	's failing health brought his letter-writ - ing practically to an end .

		Beginning where ' * Praeterita ' leaves off , the letters form a sort of - sequel to that unique autobiography .

		To those not already pretty familiar with
Ruskin	PERSON	's peculiarities these letters must bring some disillusion , along with delight at theii marvellouis display of varied and brilliant ■ attainments .

		The only child of fondly devoted parents , and a child of genius at the same time ,
Ruskin	PERSON	was reared and educated in such a way as to foster those qualities of impulsiveness and unrestraint and emphatic self-assertion which are so manifest in his writings .

		Together `` with a few instances of admirable reticence , we have in his letters many less praiseworthy jieldings to whim and impulse and the annoy - ance of the moment .

		Yet if it be desirable to know the truth and the whole truth about a famous man , to have in very fact the real Rus - kin before us , perhaps this prodigality of self - revealment is not to be regretted , especially - since by no means the least conspicuous trait ■ disclosed is the beautiful craving for human love and sympathy which it seemed his destiny - never to be able to satisfy .

		Remarkable indeed is the quickness of cordial welcome with which
Ruskin	PERSON	at thirty-eight opened his heart to the young American stranger , nine years his junior , in that autumn of
1855	DATE	when Mr.
Norton	PERSON	sought him out .

		In a surprisingly brief space - the formal ' My dear Sir ' of the Englishman 's first letter gave place to ` Dear
Norton	PERSON	, ' while this in turn changed with better acquaintance to ` My dear
Charles	PERSON	, ' ` My dearest

		and at last ` My darling
Charles	PERSON	. '

		Through a similar ascending scale of warmth do the letter - endings rapidly pass , -- ` Very truly yours / ` Yours affectionately , ' and so on , up to ` Ever your lovingest
J. R.	PERSON	' So little of the tj ^ ical Briton 's armor of shy reserve did
Ruskin	PERSON	wear .

		Our first quotation shall be from the editor 's description of a small dinner party at Den - mark Hill , the
Ruskin	PERSON	homestead .

		` Another topic of the after-dinner talk was
Emer	PERSON	- son 's `` English Traits , '' which was then a new book .

		All praised it .

		`` How did he come to find out so much about us ? ''

		said the elder Mr.
Euskin	PERSON	, `` especially as regards matters on which we keep quiet and are reserved among ourselves . ''

		That was the voice of the generation to which Mr.
Euskin	PERSON	belonged .

		His son , speak - ing for himself and for his generation , would hardly have used the like terms .

		One of the great changes in
England	LOCATION	during the nineteenth century was the breaking down of many of the old-style walls within which the shy Englishman was wont to entrench himself , and no English writer ever opened himself and his life to the public with more complete and indiscreet reserve than
Euskin	LOCATION	.

		His father would have been horrified could he in the days of which I am writing have foreseen the revelations of `` Fors '' and `` Praeterita . ''

		They do , indeed , form a contrast which is both humorous and pathetic to the close reserves of
Denmark	LOCATION	Hill , and to the strict Anglican conventions , at their best so pleasant and so worthy of respect , in accordance to which life was there conducted . '

		A few letters from the elder
Ruskin	PERSON	are included in the collection , and they have an old-fashioned courtesy and formality about them that not only make them pleasant read - ing , but that place them in the sharpest con - trast with the son 's unchecked outpourings .

		The stately and awe-inspiring mother also comes to view now and then , and the wonder grows that such a son was ever born of such parents .

		A letter of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's written in
December , 1856	DATE	, is amusingly illustrative of his fondness for page-long sentences .

		It is also amusing in other respects .

		Note the ` candour and reflec - tive charity ' with which he speaks of
Rome	LOCATION	, his one early visit to which had been at a time of ill health .

		` Seasoning with myself in the severest way , and checking whatever malice against the things I have injured , or envy of you , there may be in the feel - ings with which I now think of
Eome	ORGANIZATION	, these appear to me incontrovertible and accurate conclusions , -- that the streets are damp and mouldy where they are not burning ; that the modern architecture is fit only to put on a Twelfth cake in sugar -LRB- e , g. the churches at the Quattro Fontane -RRB- ; that the old architecture consists chiefly of heaps of tufo and bricks ; that the Tiber is muddy ; that the fountains are fantastic ; that the Castle of
St. Angelo	LOCATION	is too round ; that the Capitol is too square ; that St.
Peter	PERSON	's is too big ; that all the other churches are too little ; that the Jews ' quarter is uncomfortable ; that the English quarter is unpicturesque ; that
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's Moses is a monster ; that his Last Judgment is a mistake ; that
Eaphael	ORGANIZATION	's Transfigiira - 418 THE DIAIi -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, tion is a failure ; that
Apollo Belvidere	LOCATION	is a public nuisance ; that the bills are high ; the malaria strong ; the dissipation shameful ; the bad company numerous ; the Sirocco depressing ; the
Tramontana	PERSON	chilling ; the Levante parching ; the Ponente pelt - ing ; the ground unsafe ; the politics perilous .

		I do think ^ that in all candour and reflective charity , I may assert this much . '

		That
Ruskin	PERSON	would persist , despite his physi - cian 's warnings , in burning his candle at both ends and at several intermediate points , is well kno ^ vn .

		Here is a passage depicting his rest - less industry : ' I am tormented by what I can not get said , nor done .

		I want to get all the Titians , Tintorets ,
Paul Veroneses	PERSON	,
Turners	ORGANIZATION	, and Sir Joshuas in the world into one great fire proof Gothic gallery of marble and serpentine .

		I want to get them all perfectly engraved .

		I want to go and draw all the subjects of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's 19,000 sketches in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, elaborated by myself .

		I want to get every - body a dinner who has n't got one .

		I want to macadamize some new roads to Heaven with broken fools ' - heads .

		I want to hang up some knaves out of the way , not that I 've any dislike to them , but I think it would be wholesome for them , and for other people , and that they would make good crow 's meat .

		I want to play all day long and arrange my cabinet of minerals with new white wool .

		I want somebody to amuse me when I 'm tired .

		I want
Turner	PERSON	's pictures not to fade ... Farther , I want to make the Italians industrious , the
Ameri	PERSON	- cans quiet , the Swiss romantic , the Roman Catholics rational , and the English Parliament honest -- and I can ' t do anything and don ' t understand what I was born for .

		I get melaacholy -- overeat myself , over - sleep myself -- get pains in the back -- do n't know what to do in any wise . '

		Surely few good men have ever been so relentlessly pursued by the demon of unrest .

		It is probable that his disappointments in love ,
Avhich	PERSON	are frankly referred to in his letters , had much to do with his urgent need of occupation .

		Interesting in this connection is the following paragraph : ` As for things that have influenced me , I believe hard work , love of justice and of beauty , good nature and great vanity , have done all of me that was worth doing .

		I 've had my heart broken , ages ago , when I was a boy -- then mended , cracked , beaten in , kicked about old corridors , and finally , I think , flattened fairly out .

		I 've picked up what education I 've got in an irregular way -- and it 's very little .

		I suppose that on the whole as little has been got into me and out of me as under any circumstances was probable ; it is true , had my father made me his clerk I might have been in a fair way of becoming a respectable Political Econo - mist in the manner of R'icardo or Mill -- ^ but grant - ing liberty and power of travelling , and working as I chose , I suppose everything I 've chosen to have been about as wrong as wrong could be . '

		As characteristic of the multiplicity of his interests and affinities , and as illustrating the perpetual youthfulness of genius , may be men - tioned his announcement , at fifty , that he is taking music lessons . '

		I am learning , ' he says , ` how to play musical scales quite rightly , and have a real Music-master twice a week , and practice always half an hour a day . '

		This is from a letter enumerating ten different things he is busy with , one of them being the writing of a course of lectures to be delivered at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The absorbing interest he took in political economy , in the hope of bringing to pass better things in his own and in other countries , claimed more and more of his time and strength , and incidentally moved him to cry out in a sort of Carlylean rage at those whom he conceived to be inculcating error in this department .

		` But when I accuse Mill of being the root of all immediate evil among us in
England	LOCATION	, I am in earn - est -- the man being looked up to as `` the greatest thinker '' when he is in truth an utterly shallow and wretched segment of a human creature , incapa - ble of understanding Anything in the ultimate con - ditions of it , and countenancing with unhappy for - tune , whatever is fatallest in the popular error of English mind .

		I want you to look a little at the really great statements of Economical principle made by the true Men of all time ; and you will gradually feel what deadly cast skin of the car - casses of every error they abhorred , modern `` Economists '' have patched up their hide with . '

		Referring to the talk raised by his deliverances on this subject , he declares that he does not care two straws what people think of him after he is dead , but that he does care very much what is said of him while alive ; and he begs his correspondent to do all in his power to allay the continual provocation he receives from the universal assumption that he knows nothing ' about political economy and is a fool for open - ing his mouth on the subject .

		A letter written soon after the Carlyle-Emerson correspondence appeared has the following : ` It has been a great mortification and disappoint - ment to me not to see S. again ; but the world 's made up of morts and disses , and it 's no use always saying `` Ay de mi ! ''

		like
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		I 'm really ashamed of him in those letters to
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		My own diaries are indeed full of mewing and moan - ing , all to myself , but I think my letters to friends have more a tendency to crowing , or , at least , on the whole , try to be pleasant . '

		Thus incorrectly do we picture to ourselves the impression we make on others .

		But with all
Ruskin	PERSON	's indulgence in a sort of lovable petu - lance , he now and then , perhaps to humor a mere whim , is noticeably reticent .

		One likes his saying nothing at all about his appointment to the Oxford professorship , and nothing about his election as Lord Rector of
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	, in letters that might well have dealt with little else .


Ruskin	PERSON	's admiration for
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	is enthusias - tic but not uncritical .

		Referring to
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's essay on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, he calls it very good ; ' hut / he adds , Hhe entire school of you moderns judge hopelessly out , of these older ones , because you never admit the possibility of their know - ing what we do n't .

		Lowell speaks of Dante as if
Dante	ORGANIZATION	were a for - ward schoolboy , and
Lowell	PERSON	his master . '

		Strong as was
Buskin	PERSON	's liking ` for some of Mr. Nor - ton 's American friends , he could not , during our Civil War , which horrified and sickened him , find much that was good in things or per - sons American .

		His utter lack of sympathy with either the union cause or the anti-slavery cause , was remarkable , but of course not pecu - liar to him among Englishmen .

		Another literary criticism is worth quoting .


Ruskin	PERSON	says of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's death , that ' the liter - ary loss is infinite / but very frankly adds , -- `
Dickens	PERSON	was a pure modernist -- a leader of the steam-whistle party par excellence -- and he had no understanding of any power of antiquity except a sort of jackdaw sentiment for cathedral towers .

		He knew nothing of the nobler power of superstition -- was essentially a stage manager , and used every - thing for effect on the pit .

		His Christmas meant mistletoe and pudding -- neither resurrection from dead , nor rising of new stars , nor teaching of wise men , nor shepherds .

		His hero is essentially the iron-master ; in spite of `` Hard times , '' he has advanced by his influence every principle that makes them harder -- the love of excitement , in all classes , and the fury of business competition , and the distrust both of nobility and clergy which , wide enough and fatal enough , and too justly founded , needed no apostle to the mob , but a grave teacher of priests and nobles themselves , for whom
Dickens	PERSON	had essentially no word . '

		These two men were of widely dissimilar genius . '

		It is my stern desire , ' declares Rus - kin , * to get at the pure fact and nothing less or more , which gives me whatever power I have ; it is
Dickens	LOCATION	's delight in grotesque exaggera - tion which has made him , I think , nearly use - less in the present day . '

		From
1868	DATE	to 1873 Mr.
Norton	PERSON	sojourned in
Europe	LOCATION	mth his family , some months of the time in
England	LOCATION	and near
Ruskin	LOCATION	.

		Frequent letters and much personal intercourse make this a fruitful period for Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's volumes .

		Several letters from
Ruskin	LOCATION	to Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	form one of the pleasant accompaniments of this visit .

		Among noteworthy events is a meet - ing between
Darwin	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	at the
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's temporary home in Kent .

		` The contrast between them was complete , and • each in his own way was unique and delightful .


Buskin	PERSON	's gracious courtesy was matched by Dar - win 's charming and genial simplicity .


Buskin	PERSON	was full of questions which interested the elder natur - alist by the keenness of observation and the variety of scientific attainment which they indicated , and their animated talk afforded striking illustration of the many sympathies that underlay the divergence of their points of view , and of their methods of thought .

		The next morning
Darwin	PERSON	rode over on horseback to say a pleasant word about
Ruskin	PERSON	and two days afterward Euskin wrote , `` Mr.
Dar	PERSON	- win was delightful . '' '

		The editor is apparently in error when he calls this the first meeting ; for
Ruskin	PERSON	himself has told us , in ' Praeterita ' or elsewhere , that he met Darwin at Dr.
Buckland	PERSON	's in his -LRB- Rus - kin 's -RRB- undergraduate days at
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		* He , and I got on together and - talked all the evening * is his record of the meeting .

		As volume two draws to a close we note with sadness the coming on of
Ruskin	PERSON	's infirmities , bodily and mental .

		The editor has probably spared us still further pain by large omissions from the latter part of the correspondence , and by publishing no scrap of it whatever for the last dozen years of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's life . '

		Taken all together , ' as Mr.
Norton	PERSON	says of the entire series of letters , ' they form a tragic record of the perplexities of a great and generous soul , the troubles of a tender heart , the spendthrift use and at last the failure of exceptional powers .

		Such genius , such high aim , such ardent yet often ill-directed effort , and such great yet broken achievement , such splendors sinking into such glooms , -- it is a sorrowful ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ • '

		Italian Country Houses .

		* On first acquaintance the Italian villa does not , as a rule , appeal to the taste of the Amer - ican .

		He is disappointed to find the house built up close to the highway instead of being approached by wide pathways and drives ; in the garden , he misses the large flower-beds and expanses of green lawn to which he has been accustomed , he resents the primness and for - mality of outline , the pebbly walks , the arti - ficial cut of trees and hedges , the absence of everything wild , the presence of arrangement everywhere .

		But , before very long , becoming accustomed to the Italian climate and to Italian ways of living , he begins to realize that both house and garden have a rationale of their own , that there is a logic behind all their forms and features , and that what at first had seemed senseless is really the product of high art com - bining , as all sound art must , logic and beauty into a harmonious whole .

		The logic of the American garden is to fur - nish an agreeable outlook from the house win - dows or the street ; the logic of the Italian gar - den is that it is a place to live in , -- as a matter of fact it is lived in more than the house for months at a time .

		Therefore , the grounds are as carefully and conveniently planned as the house , with broad paths where two or more can walk abreast leading from one division to another ; with shade for
summer	DATE	and sunny sheltered walks for winter easily accessible ♦ Italian Villas and their Gardens .

Dec. 1	DATE	^ , from the house ; with terraces and formal gar - dens in the foregi'ound from which lead ilex or laurel walks , clipped into shape in order to effect a transition between the straight lines of masonry and the untrimmed growth of the outlying woodland .

		Thus each step away from architecture brings a nearer approach to nature .

		Moreover , if the surrounding landscape be of the grand type , the artist has probably broad - ened and simplified his plan .

		Intricacy of detail , complicated groupings of terraces , foun - tains , labyrintlis , and porticoes are found in sites where there is no great sweep of land - scape attuning the eye to larger impressions .

		Where landscapes are the least grand , as in northern
Italy	LOCATION	, gardens are the most elaborate .

		The great pleasure-grounds overlooking the
Eoman Campagna	PERSON	, on the contrary , are laid out on severe and majestic lines ; the parts are few , and the total effect is one of breadth and simplicity .

		And everywhere the climaite of
Italy	LOCATION	combines with the artist to effect a gradual blending of nature and architecture by covering its bronze and stone and marble with an exquisite coloring of time , the patina which can neither be imitated nor acquired in any other land or in , any other way .

		Even the unromantic site of the house on the high road is forgiven after one lives a while in an Italian villa and finds how thoroughly this secures to his private use the full extent of the grounds when no space has had to be sacrificed for the sake of a public approach to the house .

		Such , then , are the typical excellencies of the old Italian garden : free circulation of sun - light and air about the house , abundance of water , easy access to dense shade , sheltered walks with different points of view , variety of effect produced by the skilful use of different levels , and , finally , breadth and simplicity of composition .

		Utility is at the foundation , but an artistic race can never content itself with mere utility , and aesthetic emotions are as neces - sary as breathing to the life of the Italian .

		The effect of passing from the sunny fruit - garden to the dense grove , thence to the wide - reaching view , and again to the sheltered pri - vacy of the pleached walk or the mossy coolness of the grotto , -- all these were taken into account by the old artists who , centuries ago , studied the contrast of assthetic emotions as keenly as they did the juxtaposition of dark cypress and pale lemon-tree , of deep shade and level sunlight .

		Moreover , their designs were based on a principle exactly the reverse of our own .

		Whereas the modem gardener 's one idea of producing an effect of space is to annihilate boundaries , and to blend a vague whole with the landscape in general , the old garden-architect proceeded on the opposite principle , arguing that as a house containing a single huge room would be less interesting and less serviceable than one divided according to the varied requirements of its inmates , so also a garden which consists of merely one huge outdoor room is less interesting and less serviceable than one which has its logical divisions .

		The American who stops long enough in
Italy	LOCATION	is sure , sooner or later , to come under the spell of the Italian villas and their gardens , and - he who began by scoffing ends by praising .

		On some fair day , as he wanders under the umbrella pines of the
Villa Borghese	LOCATION	, or prom - enades the terraces of the Villa Medici , be yields to the garden-magic and ever after hi & bondage is complete .

		But how shall he explain it ?

		Who wiH understand him in his native land ?

		Why does he like these stiff and ugly things that he exhibits in photograph ?

		Analysis of impres - sions , especially of aesthetic impressions , i & always a thankless task and requires genius of a peculiar kind .

		Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, in writing of ' Italian Villas and their Gardens , ' and Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	by his pictures of them , have produced !

		a book analytic enough to satisfy the most exacting mind and beautiful enough to content the most artistic taste .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is one who , having fallen under the ineffable spell of the Italian garden-magic , has found it ' more potent , more enduring , more intoxicating to every sense than the most elaborate and glowing effects of modem horticulture , ' and she can also tell us why .

		She has analyzed the secret of the charm , and shows us that it is because the great object of all landscape gardening -- the fusion of nature and art -- has never been so success - fully accomplished as in the treatment of the Italian country-house from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the end of the eight - eenth .

		Indeed , next to sitting on a marble bench and watching the play of light and shade among the trees and statues of an Italian garden for oneself , is the pleasure of reading about it in this book .

		Who that has availed himself of the
Wednesday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	privilege of rambling in the grounds of the Villa Medici at
Rome	LOCATION	, will not feel .

		himself again transported there by Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's description ?

		` It is not necessary to be a student of garden - architecture to feel the spell of quiet and serenity which falls on one at the very gateway ; but it i '' worth the student 's while to try to analyze the ele - ments of which the sensation is composed .

		Per - haps they will be found to resolve themselves into diversity , simplicity , fitness .

		The plan of the gar - den is simple , but its different parts are so con - trasted as to produce , by the fewest means , a pleas - ant sense of variety without sacrifice of repose .

		... Emerging from the straight shady walks , , with their effect of uniformity and repose , one comes on the flower-garden before the house , spread - ing to the sunshine its box-edged parterres adorned with fountains and statues .

		THE DIAL , 4 ^ 1 house-front are harmonized by a strong predomi - nance of architectural lines , and by the beautiful lateral loggia , with niches for statues , above which the upper ilex-wood rises .

		Tall hedges and trees there are none ; for from the villa one looks across the garden at the wide sweep of the
Campagna	PERSON	and the mountains ; indeed , this is probably one of the first of the gardens which Gurlitt defines as `` gar - dens to look out from '' in contradistinction to the earlier sort , `` gardens to look into . ''

		Mounting to the terrace , one comes to the third division of the garden , the wild-wood with its irregular levels , through which a path leads to the mount , with a little temple on its summit .

		This is a rare feature in Italian grounds ; in hilly
Italy	LOCATION	there was small need of creating the artificial hillocks so much esteemed in the old English gardens .

		In this case , however , the mount justifies its existence , for it affords a wonderful view over the other side of
Rome	LOCATION	and the
Campagna	LOCATION	. '

		In other chapters , we get similar sympa - thetic descriptions of the villas of
Florence	LOCATION	, of
Siena	LOCATION	, of
Genoa	LOCATION	, of
Lombardy	LOCATION	,
Venetia	PERSON	, and other regions .

		The cult of the Italian garden in
America	LOCATION	has hardly progressed further than an attempt to introduce Italian ' effects ' by placing a mar - ble bench here , a sun-dial there , and statues numerous .

		But it is not thus that we shall bring the old garden magic into our own garden patches .

		What will help us is to improve OUT opportunities for studying the old garden craft , which had for its aim to make a garden adapted to the uses for which it was to be put .

		Thus may we bring into our landscape and our age not indeed the Italian garden itself , but the informing spirit which told those men of old that house , garden and landscape must each be planned with reference to the other and blended into one harmonious whole ; which taught them how with simple materials and in a limited space they might give , impressions of distance and sensations of the unexpected for which one now looks in vain outside of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The pictures , many of them in color , are of uncommon beauty and charm ; while cover design and mechanical features throughout make the volume one of great distinction even at this time when publishers are vying with each other as never before in the elegance of their output .

		The
Autobiography of Justist McCarthy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	's life has been one of such varied interests and broad experience as to warrant the expectation that his autobiog - raphy would include scenes and incidents attractive to a wide circle of readers .

		Born near the city of
Cork	ORGANIZATION	, in Ir eland , his youth was * An Irishman 's Story .

		By
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		spent in an atmosphere which was heavily charged with literary aspiration , and in which the pressure of genteel poverty acted as a spur to endeavor .

		It was family poverty that turned him from law to journalism as a profession .

		Beginning as a reporter for the * Cork Exam - iner ' in
1848	DATE	, his first newspaper work was connected with the stories of suffering endured during the years of the great famine , and with the rebellion that followed .

		From this he gained a close and sympathetic understanding of political and social conditions in his native country , and grew into touch with the acknowl - edged leaders of Irish thought .

		But his ambi - tion had always been to see for himself , and to be a part of , the intense journalistic life of
London	LOCATION	; and he welcomed an offer of a place on a
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	paper as a step in that direc - tion .

		Finally , in
1860	DATE	, he secured a place on the ' Morning Star , ' a Radical
London	LOCATION	journal , at that time controlled and guided by
John Bright	ORGANIZATION	.

		This brought acquaintance with that element in English politics which best under - stood conditions in
America	LOCATION	, and stood for a distinctly friendly attitude toward the North in our Civil War .

		The influence of Bright in this connection is unmistakeable in the writings of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	at this period , and in his speeches in
America	LOCATION	at a later date .

		Mean - while , he was growing in power in newspaper work , making more or less successful experi - ments in the production of novels and histories , and becoming thoroughly familiar with politics and politicians by reason of his duties as a reporter of debates in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1868	DATE	he came to
America	LOCATION	, where he was already known as a writer of short stories and as a literary critic , but came primarily to seek a lecture-field and a wider public for his books .

		Throughout all this period he had been a quiet though untiring worker in the cause of Irish independence , though without much hope of any immediate betterment of the situation .

		But in
1871	DATE	he thought conditions were ripe for the adoption of a definite policy by Irish Nationalists ; and , setting aside the attractive idea of American citizenship , he returned to
England	LOCATION	to throw himself heart and soul into what was for him the one great patriotic cause .

		He was welcomed by the leaders of his party , and in
1873	DATE	became a member of Parliament for the Irish constituency of
Longford	LOCATION	, soon being elected vice-chairman of the party of which
Parnell	PERSON	was the head , bearing his share of the burden of those tactics of obstruction adopted by
Parnell	PERSON	as the only means of forcing English attention to Irish grievances , devoting his pen to the service of the cause , and mean - while earning the means of support for himself and his family by all sorts of literary produc -- tions .

		Later he became the personal represen - 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, tative of Gladstx -RRB- iie , when the latter attempted to force
Parnell	PERSON	into a temporary abdication of leadership -- the result of the scandal aroused by the
Parnell	PERSON	divorce suit ; and upon
Parnell	PERSON	's refusal to retire , he was chosen chairman of that majority of the Irish party which thought the only hope of
Ireland	LOCATION	lay in acquiescence to the will of the great leader of the liberal party .

		The succeeding years inflicted on Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	the unhappiness of being personally engaged in the bitter political quarrels of his native coun - try , and of seeing many of the strong ties of long friendship severed by political animosities .

		Ultimately , ill-health drove him from political life ; and since
1897	DATE	he has given his whole time to such literary labor as has been possible under the infliction of a partial loss of sight , serious enough to forbid any work whether of reading or writing without the aid of an amanuensis .

		This bare outline of a wonderfully interest - ing and useful life indicates the principal topics upon which Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has touched in his autobiography .

		From whatever aspect this life is considered , whether in the light of literary acquaintance in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, or of social conditions in
Ireland	LOCATION	, or of political conditions in
England	LOCATION	, enough material existed for a vividly illuminative and wholly entertain - ing work .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	had , as a part of his equipment for the field of journalism , an unu - sually attractive personality , pleasing manners , and a happy ability in social conversation .

		He also came to be trusted for the unvarying kind - ness of his judgments , and for his desire to avoid wounding the sensibilities of others .

		It followed that wherever he went or lived , he was welcomed by men in all walks of life , and was entrusted with secret motives and purposes to an extent enjoyed by few other men of his time .

		His readers will therefore expect intimate char - acterizations of men famous in the literary or the political world , and details of the inner workings of Irish associations and English politics .

		But here is a genuine disappointment ; for Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has carefully refrained from anytliing like intimate description or details .

		Possibly , and conceivably , it is a very delicate undertaking for a man to permit the publica - tion , during his life-time , of writings unravel - ling concealed political manoeuvres , or indulg - ing in honest and fearless criticism ; and pos - sibly also Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	might urge that the public should be interested in his own life , when he tells it , and not demand careful analy - sis of other men 's acts and books .

		But the fact remains that he has been so extremely good-natured in his treatment of personalities as to deny to his work any suggestion of that intimate knowledge which its author undoubt - ^ y possesses .

		There is such a thing as carrying good-nature and kindness of treatment too far .

		The result in the present work is to make it easy to chal - lenge the soundness of the author 's judgments ; and in truth his judgments , by their very gen - erosity , are provocative of such challenge .

		Hif !

		comments , whether of men or of events , can be designated by no other term than ' scrappy , ' with the unfortunate result that the pages devoted to comparatively unimportant events in his own life seem wasted , when topics of ex - treme interest in the literary or political world are but hastily summarized .

		In the course of his story over a hundred and fifty names are briefly mentioned , of persons in the dramatic , literary , or political world , with whom Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	claims acquaintance .

		With most of these he could have had no more than acquaint - ance .

		How much more satisfactory would have been a careful even though wholly kindly account of the few whom he knew with suffi - cient intimacy to render his estimate worth consideration .

		Such a mere enumeration of notables might seem an evidence of egotism on the part of the author ; but this is certainly not the case , for if egotism were the cause of this lack of discrim - ination it would be manifested by a self - lauda - tory history of services rendered to the cause of Irish nationalism and to literature .

		Far from offering such a history , he is here also brief and disinclined to expand upon his own labors .

		Now , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has met with vari - ous judgments from critics and historians as to the merits of his writings , but of his genuine service to the cause of
Ireland	LOCATION	there can be but one opinion .

		He has stood forward as a pure , high-minded Irish patriot , pursuring honest and upright methods in politics , steadily devoted to an ideal form of government for his beloved island .

		He has been able and vig - orous , a real help to the cause ; and has been closely in touch with all the movements of the last twenty-five years in both English and Irish politics .

		Why then could he not have told us more of himself , of the causes of things , of the characters of the men engaged with him or opposed to him in the pursuit of that high ideal -- in fine , more of the actual political life and labors of Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	?

		This would not have been regarded as an evidence of egotism , save by the hypercritical ; for the repu - tation of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	will survive , not as an author and critic , but as a worker in the cause of Irish nationalism , and he has a right to tell his story in this connection at any length he pleases .

		It is to be hoped that for the sake of historical knowledge , if for no other reason , he will still find strength and inclination to attempt this task .

		THE DIAL 423 The
IjAtest History of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The first volume of Messrs. Chancellor and
Hewes	PERSON	's '
The United States	LOCATION	: A History of Three Centuries ' presents a pleasing appear - ance .

		With an attractive binding , with clear print , and with many novel and sometimes use - ful little maps to illustrate the text , the gen - eral impression is inviting .

		One notes favor - ably , also , the plan of the work , and especially the division of each volume into four sections , which treat respectively of ' Population and Politics / ^ War and Conquest , ' ` Industry and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, ' and ' Civilization . '

		The work is Lo be complete in ten parts , each of which will be a unit and will be sold separately .

		Unfortunately , notwithstanding the large promises of the ' Publisher 's Announcement * prefixed to tliis volume , there is much to crit - icize with reference to the execution of the work .

		One of the authors , we are told , ` has for a series of years -LSB- sic -RSB- been accepted as a leading authority in the department of statis - tical and economic history ' ; and the other 's * clear-cut and vigorous style , his dramatic and picturesque presentation of events , and his critical and discriminating characterization of the men about whom American history has been shaped and whose careers are themselves a large factor in such history , will serve to give to readers who are already familiar with the subject fresh interest in it ; while the younger readers of the later generation will , it is be - lieved , secure from this history information and interest not to be found in any other single work . '

		Without attempting to controvert these posi - tive assertions as to the merits of the authors , we may accept the last statement , though hardly in the sense intended .

		Certainly the ' 3 ` ounger readers ' will find here much infor - mation , if not interest , ` not to be found in any other single work . '

		Let us take , for example , these statements as to the
Funda	ORGANIZATION	- mental Constitutions of
Carolina	LOCATION	, -RSB- -RRB- age 285 : * In
1669	DATE	the `` unalterable Constitutions '' were begun .

		These were devised by the
Earl of Shaftes	ORGANIZATION	- bury , that famous
Anthony Ashley Cooper	PERSON	whose initial `` A '' appears in the word `` Cabal . ''

		They were originated in
1667	DATE	, after the death of
Claren	PERSON	- don , and were prepared in literary form by his private secretary , the immortal philosopher ,
John Locke	PERSON	, than whom no other philosopher ever did a worse piece of work in an attempt at constructive statesmanship .

		There is , however , no evidence that he really approved of the Constitutions , though he doubtless acquiesced in the political theory of his employer . '

		Without any attempt to argue the question of authorship , it may be noted that th ese sen - * The

		tences must convey a very distorted and con - fused idea to the reader 's mind .

		As a matter of fact ,
Clarendon	PERSON	did not die until
1674	DATE	, and
Locke	PERSON	was
Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	's private secretary , not
Clarendon 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doubtless the authors are famil - iar with these facts ; but if so , why not be more accurate ?

		As remarkably misleading are the statements upon page 313 , to the eflEect that Governor
Nicholson	PERSON	's ` very unpopularity stirred his political enemy ,
James Blair	PERSON	, to go to Eng - land , and , by the greatest efforts to secure a charter for the second college in
America	LOCATION	,
William and Mary	PERSON	, founded in
1693	DATE	at
Wil	LOCATION	- liamstown .

		From
1672	DATE	to 1698 Sir
Edmund Andros	PERSON	was governor in
Virginia	LOCATION	, after his exciting experiences as governor of
New England	LOCATION	. '

		The date 1673 is wrong ,
Williams	PERSON	- town should be
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, and at this time
Blair	PERSON	and
Nicholson	PERSON	were friends .

		It would seem hard to use more careless language about this one topic ; but this feat the authors accom - plish later -LRB- page 473 -RRB- by referring to
William	LOCATION	and
Mary College	ORGANIZATION	in
Maryland	LOCATION	!

		Not all the pages are so bad as these quoted : the treatment of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Middle Col - onies is less inaccurate than that of the South - em Colonies .

		But the suspicion thus aroused finds too much justification elsewhere .

		A happy uncertainty or carelessness to the beginning of the year under the Old Style causes the writers to refer to the same event as of different years .

		On page 238 ,
Charles II	PERSON	.

		dies in
1685	DATE	, but on page 312 the news of James II .

		's accession reaches
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1684	DATE	; and the error is repeated on page 321 .

		It would be better to take one system and stick to it .

		Further instances of confusion in dates may be noted : on page 132 ,
1558	DATE	should be
1658	DATE	; on page 237 ,
1626	DATE	should be
1624	DATE	; on page 291 -LRB- map -RRB- ,
1653	DATE	should be
1563	DATE	.

		These are errors contained in the text .

		Appended to each sec - tion , and sometimes to an individual chap - ter , is a list of events with dates , entitled ' Historical Perspective , ' and sometimes this is supplemented by a colored scheme or plan to help the weary intellect .

		Both lists and plans are fearfully and wonderfully made , often inclu ` ding matters not referred to in the text , and vice versa .

		The statements found in them are frequently inaccurate , and sometimes unin - telligible .

		The bibliographical matter also is not well selected , and one has a grave suspicion that some books included therein -- e. g. , the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Studies -- have not received exhaustive attention from the authors .

		The work , or at least this volume , in its present form , full of mistakes and omissions , can make little pretense to scholarship .

		To serve even a popular use , the succeeding volumes should show a marked improvement upon this one .

Dec. 16	DATE	^ Fifty Yea rs of Illlnois .

		* It is perhaps one of the inevitable conse - quences of the centralization of power in the federal government of the
United States	LOCATION	, espe - cially since the Civil War , that not only should the various States lose individual prestige with their waning powers , but that the status of the American as an inhabitant or native of a
State	ORGANIZATION	should seem to him of comparative unimpor - tance beside his status as a citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The practical decision by the arbitra - ment of arms in 1861-65 that the sovereign States of the Union do not possess that final attribute of sovereignty , the right of secession , -- until that arbitrament a question open , at least , to discussion , -- has diminished the impor - tance of the individual
State	ORGANIZATION	in the minds of practically all Americans in the
northern States	LOCATION	, and has modified greatly the feeling of those in the South .

		It is likely that even now the real affection and pride of dwellers in the newer States , as in the West , turn toward the commonwealths of their origin in the
East	LOCATION	, rather than to those in which they live ; while the descendants of immigrants of more recent introduction , and a fortiori the immigrants themselves , find their pride almost wholly absorbed by their American citizenship in rela - tion to the government at
Washington	LOCATION	, with little left for the closer and more intimate government in their own
State	ORGANIZATION	capitol .

		No book published for a long while past can be said to compare with Colonel
Clark E. Carp	PERSON	's ' The mini : A Story of the Prairies , ' as regards its effect of awakening in the breast of the inhabitant of an individual
State	ORGANIZATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	in this instance , a feeling of proper pride in the achievements of his ' fellows as citizens of a
State	ORGANIZATION	rather than of
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	.

		No American can arise from a perusal of this book without a vastly increased respect , based upon authentic knowledge , for the people of
Illinois	LOCATION	; and to the Ulinoisan it will come almost as a gospel of enlightenment and encouragement to inter - est himself in the past history and present fame of so majestic a commonwealth .

		This is the first and most important aspect of Colonel
Carr	PERSON	's handsomely printed and entertaining volume : that it stands as the interpreter to .

		millions of people politically united of their own history and serious glory , and to the vaster multitude outside the State of the part played by
Illinois	LOCATION	in the enactment of one of the world 's greatest political and social dramas .

		history .

		From this experience , and from per - sonal contact with the men who made
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	great a half-century ago , he provides a series of pen-pictures of those whom
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	gave to the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	for its preservation during the period of its greatest struggle ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, .

		Douglas ,
Logan	LOCATION	,
Oglesby	PERSON	,
Yates	PERSON	,
Palmer	PERSON	,
Inger	PERSON	- soll ,
Davis	PERSON	, Secretary Hay , -- these are some of the names that fill a large place in Colonel
Carr	PERSON	's pages .

		Nothing except the very high - est literary art could excel in vividness of pre - sentation the actuality of these figures , which live and breathe here as they did in life , men of like passions and feelings with ourselves , , humanized as they can not be on the formal pages of history ; strong men all , but with the weaknesses of the strong to keep them sweetly reasonable and humane .

		Chief figure of all is
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and Colonel
Carr	PERSON	's portrait of ' Old Abe ' must add to the iRterest , however great it is to-day , with which he is regarded .

		` My first impression was that lie was the home - liest man I had ever seen ; but as he moved an ^ spoke , this impression was gradually changed .

		He was awkward and ungainly , bony and angular , his - body abnormally extending , his long legs and arms terminating in big feet and large bony fingers .

		His neck was long , and seemed to be intended espe - cially to lift his head high enough to survey every object about him .

		His head was covered with thick matted brown hair ; his forehead was not high but wide , his nose was prominent , his mouth large , his jaws widening back from his mouth and chin , and his cheek-bones high .

		He had dark grey eyes , well set in his head , heavy eyebrows , a large expressive mouth , and dark complexion . '

		The book may be briefly described as a story told in the first person by one who , at the beginning of the narrative , is a mere lad remov - ing with his parents from their comfortable home in central
New York	LOCATION	to a prairie farm in central
Illinois	LOCATION	, situated not a great way from the flourishing city of
Galesburg	LOCATION	.

		The father of this boy was already an abolitionist , and the son took his opinions and carried them through the days of persecution and unrighteousness to their great and bloody vindication on the fiel < 3 of battle .

		The fortunes of this little fellow are followed patiently through youth into man - hood , through the early struggles of
Eepubli	LOCATION	- can radicalism against Democratic conserva - tism , through the excitements of the
Lincoln	LOCATION	-
Douglas	PERSON	debates and the nomination of Lincoln for the presidency , through
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's election and inauguration , and through the fighting of Grant in the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley , the narrative
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 425 closing with the -
fall	DATE	of
New Orleans	LOCATION	and the imminent control of the great river by the federal forces .

		So much of the story is fully authentic and in .

		a sense autobiographical .

		But , for good measure and mindful of his countrymen 's liking for a love story , Colonel
Carr	PERSON	has added a romance of real moment , an outgrowth of the times , properly subordinating it to the more important events of actual his - tory .

		This romance is in two parts , one having to do with the love of the youthful hero for a charming girl of wealth and station , the other with the career of a slave , the son of a slave , from the moment of his escape from a brutal overseer on a
Missouri	LOCATION	plantation to his trium - phant vindication as the descendant of an important and aristocratic family of
France	LOCATION	.

		Tliis story would make an entertaining book in itself , independent of the historical and biographical incidents in which it is imbedded .

		Taken as a whole , the book is of a sort not to he described in a phrase , -- - a skilful blending of fact and fiction quite different from the usual historical romance in form and treatment .

		On his title-page Colonel
Carr	PERSON	quotes from Father Hennepin the sentence from which the name of his work is derived : ^ The word
Illinois	LOCATION	comes from the Indian Illini , signifying a com - plete , finished , and perfect Man , imbued with the spirit and bravery of the men of every nation that ever lived . '

		The etymology can not fail to gain new emphasis and significance through this intimate picture of men and measures in the most momentous period of
Illinois	LOCATION	history .

		^ The
Luxury of Children	ORGANIZATION	and Some Other Lux - uries ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a book of informal and very engaging essays by Mr.
Edward Sandford Mar	PERSON	- tin , wherein is proved , to the satisfaction of all right-minded persons , that no other luxury is to be compared for a moment with the luxury of children .

		Incidentally the author makes his readers feel that life is a very good thing and that there is plenty of fun in it for the man who will cease striving so desperately to get things that he would n't care about if he had them .

		Besides their breezy optimism , the particular merit of the essays is that they are entertaining without being dogmatic on issues which are sel - dom discussed without the dullest kind of dog - matism .

		Most writers about children have an axe to grind .

		Mr.
Martin	PERSON	does not ; he tells us what he has observed and what he thinks , with - out insisting that we agi-ee with him , and with - out even being sure that his is the only right way of looking at the subject .

		He does not seem to cai-e much on what system of parental manage - ment children are brought up , or where , how much , or by what theories they are schooled .

		Yet he is not to be classed with those most unpleas - ant and insidious of all dogmatists , the advo - cates of the ` Just let them grow ' method .

		The publishers have provided a delightful setting for this delightful book .

		There are eight full-page colored plates by Miss
Sarah S. Stilwell	PERSON	, and the same artist has filled the wide margins with tiny pictures of quaint little lads and lassies , singly or in groups , working , playing , laughing , crying , sleeping , or wondering at the big world they live in .

		These little pictures are printed in two colors , with a decidedly original and pleasing result .

		Among the very choicest of the season 's holi - day reprints are `` three volumes which inaugurate the Dent-Dutton series of ` English Idylls . '

		The publishers state in one of the prefaces , that they hope eventually to include in the series ' all those pieces of fine literature which depend for their charm on the presentment of the simpler life and emotion amid the environment of sweet counti ' y scenes around our old English homes . '

		They could not have selected three more charming idylls for a beginning than
Goldsmith	PERSON	's ' Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, ' Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's `
Cranford	LOCATION	, ' and
Miss Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's ` Our Village . '

		Each volume is very daintily bound in gray and gold , and delightfully illustrated by Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	.

		The quaint humor and picturesque setting which all three stories share in common , have tempted many illustrators ; but the opportunity afforded by modern processes of color printing furnishes the present edition with ample excuse for being .

		Mr.
Brock	PERSON	is at his best in pen-and-ink , but the soft coloring and delicate finish of his water - colors is almost as unusual , and his humor is of exactly the sort needed to interpret these clas - sics .

		He has provided twenty-five illustrations for each volume .

		In them all , the human figures are the central interest , but the village scenes , of the sort that are fast fading from English life , and the delightful costumes and manners of early Victorian days , all receive due attention .

		A brief foreword gives an interesting history of each classic .

		`
Cranford	LOCATION	' and ` The Vicar ' are of course published in their entirety ; ` The Village ' sketches are selected from the five volumes of the complete work , the effort being to choose those chapters that best show the author 's personality and that are most directly studies of nature and of village character .

		These idylls are of the sort that never grow old or lose their interest ; but one re-reads them with a new zest and a keener appreciation , to the .

		accompaniment of Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's suggestive pictorial interpretations .

		A holiday publication in lighter vein , but charming enough to satisfy the most critical taste , is Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's illustrated ` Ru - baiyat of a Persian Kitten ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		One opens it assured that it is .

		good , being Mr.
Her	PERSON	- f ord 's , and closes it with the conviction that Mr.
Herford	PERSON	has fairly out-done himself .

		The Cream of Life from out your Bowl shall pour Nine times -- ere it lie broken on the floor , '' with the absurd little angel-pussy soaring away from a broken milk-bowl on the opposite page , every stanza and every picture.is irresistible .

		It is , almost useless to quote , since we can not repro - duce the pictures , but we are tempted to give one or two of the stanzas .

		Here is the moth - eaten alley cat 's advice to the Kitten : • Myself when young did eagerly frequent The Backyard fence and heard great argument .

		About it and about , yet ever more Came out with fewer fur than in I went . '

		And this is the Kitten 's reflection on a tenanted mouse-trap : ' Tis but a Tent where takes his one
Night	ORGANIZATION	's Rest A Rodent to the Realms of Death address 'd , When Cook , arising , looks for him and then -- Baits , and prepares it for another Guest . '

		An art book at once beautiful and of peculiar interest and imiqueness is the collection of ^ Drawings of
Hans Holbein	PERSON	, ' the first volume in a series of * Drawings of the
Great Masters	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		It is tastefully bound in dull blue paper boards , stamped with a grace - ful design in gold , and backed with vellum .

		There are forty-eight quarto-sized plates , some in half-tone on white paper , others printed in tints and momited on a paper of harmonious shade ; so that the publication is , to begin with , a luxurious and unusually alluring book of pic - tures .

		An introduction by Mr.
A. L. Baldry	PERSON	, brief but pithy and suggestive , furnishes the '' backing ' that so many otherwise similar woi ` ks lack , and adds greatly to the value of the port - folio , both for art students and casual purchasers .

		Most of the drawings here reproduced belong to the famous
Windsor	LOCATION	collection of eighty-seven portraits , whose checkered history Mr.
Baldi	PERSON	' y traces down to the present time .

		Many of these , such as the portraits of the More family , of
John Colet	PERSON	,
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	, Sir
Thomas Wyatt	PERSON	,
Jane Seymour	PERSON	,
Edward VI.	PERSON	, and
Philip Melanch	PERSON	- thon , are of decided histoi'ical interest , apart from their artistic value .

		Besides the
Windsor	LOCATION	drawings , there are a few from originals pre - served at
Basle	LOCATION	, among them being one study of sheep and several interesting German types .

		Mr.
Baldry	PERSON	's introduction sums up the essential facts of
Holbein	PERSON	's life , with especial reference to his comprehensive artistic training and his many-sided artistic career , discusses very briefly his methods and aims in jx -RRB- rtraiture , and then turns to the specific subjects of the drawings .

		Attention is called to the master-touch that is as evident in
Holbein	LOCATION	's most fugitive work as in his most ambitious painting , to the ` exquisite combi - nation of delicacy and vigor ' which is the charac - teristic mark of his drawings , and to ` the instructive variety in method ' which they dis - play , and which a corresponding variation in the mounting and coloring of the plates aims to reproduce .

		Mr.
Baldry	PERSON	's comment not only fits his readers to appreciate the drawings , but is so inspiring that it will lead them to make the portfolio a point of departure for further study .

		Mrs.
Julia Cartwright Ady	PERSON	, in her account of ` The Life and Art of
Sandro Botticelli	PERSON	' -LRB- But - ton -RRB- , does not assume that her work is particu - larly original ; she acknowledges indebtedness to many previous writers , particiSarly to Mr.
Beren	PERSON	- son and Mr.
Herbert Home	PERSON	, the chief recent authorities on the general subject , and to French and German commentators on the Sixtine fres - coes , the Dante drawings , and the relation be - tween
Savonarola	PERSON	and the
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	brothers .

		She explains , too , that , in spite of the keen mod - em interest in
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	and the vast amount of study recently devoted to him , our knowledge of his history is still so scanty that no complete record can be given .

		The present work is an attempt to serve up the ` fragments , ' -- to put together in accessible and fairly popular form the results of research and of criticism from the time when
Ruskin	PERSON	re-discovered
Botticelli	PERSON	to the present , when
Walter Pater	PERSON	, the Pre-Raph - aelite painters , and a host of others have made his name familiar and interesting to the art - loving public .

		Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	's work is , of course , thoroughly standard and adequate , showing % ^ full knowledge of the bibliography of the subject and an unusual ability to view her material in many different lights , and thus to make the most of it .

		The masters with whom the painter studied , the friends he loved , the environment that molded him , ` his relations with the Medicis and the Florentine humanists on the one hand , and his connection with
Savonarola	PERSON	and the Piagnone revival on the other , ' the life he lived and the pictures he painted , are all matters of interest to Mrs. Ady .

		Forty full-page plates and as many smaller pictures set in the text eke out the verbal descriptions of the paintings .

		A few portraits are reproduced , some of the mythical paintings , more of those dealing with sacred subjects , and seven of the curious draw - ings for the ` Divine Comedy . '

		A catalogue of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's principal works , with their present locations , is appended .

		We , of course , can not do justice here to the special critical merits of the book , but merely call attention to it as a volume altogether calculated to appeal to the holiday buyer with a scholarly taste and a full purse .

		Students of English art will welcome the new popular edition of Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	's mono - graph on
Gainsborough	LOCATION	, recently imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The work was first published several years ago in a magnificent folio edition , the price of which put it far out of the reach of the general public , and which was besides very cumbersome to handle .

		The present edition , while designated as popular , is still a very hand - some book , of convenient size , substantially
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 427 bound , printed on excellent paper , and embel - lished with eight photogravures and forty fine half-tones .

		These illustrations foim a represen - tative collection of
Gainsborough	PERSON	's portraits and landscapes , and furnish a clear and adequate impression of his work .

		For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the scope of the text , it may be said that it is a complete and scholarly biographical study , prefaced by a preliminary dis - cussion of the aesthetic principles involved in
Gainsborough	LOCATION	's methods , and by a chapter on ` English Art and the Precursors of Gainsbor - ough , ' which makes possible a comparative treat - ment later on .

		The biographer complains of the paucity of details for a life of
Gainsborough	LOCATION	, but he does not let his readers feel the deficiency .

		He fills out the skeleton of facts by an indus - trious following up of slight clues and a skilful use of whatever he can run down , producing a narrative at once vivacious and authoritative , interwoven with a singularly clear and illuminat - ing analysis of the painter 's art .

		A complete catalogue of
Gainsborough	PERSON	's pictures , including portraits , landscapes , and copies , is given in an appendix .

		Mr.
N. Hudson Moore	PERSON	, known to connoisseurs in old china and old furniture for his delightful researches among these fascinating possessions of our ancestors , has now put readers who are interested in lace in his debt by writing ` The Lace Book . '

		The volume is published in elab - orate form by the
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with a charming cover design , borders of coffee-col - ored lace around each page , and about seventy illustrations .

		Many of the pictures are photo - graphs showing rare specimens of lace ; others are reproductions of famous portraits in which rare and beautiful lace is a prominent feature .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	evidently believes that association with its wearers , and with the dress and man - ners of a period , makes up a large part of the interest attaching to the study of lace .

		His pages are full of quaint anecdotes , citations from old diaries , letters and account-books , iinven - tories of royal wardrobes , sumptuary laws and trade statutes , couplets from observant poets and comedians , all showing how important a part ruffs and ruffles , frills and flounces , caps , aprons , stomachers , cuffs and collars , lappets and mantil - las played in the life of by-gone days .

		Whether one knows or cares anything about the technical side of the subject , he can not help being inter - ested in the fact that Prince
Charles	PERSON	spent fifteen pounds for the gold and silver lace on two
night	TIME	- caps which he carried with him on his Spanish trip , or that King William the Silent once squan - dered one hundred and fifty-eight pounds for six point-lace cravats .

		The book is full of such little items , fully half of them about the men , who seem to have been quite as vain and extrava - gant as the Avomen , as long as fashion gave them the chance .

		For the more practical seeker after facts there is plenty of definite and explicit infoi-mation .

		The first chapter , on ` The Growth of Lace , ' is necessarily very general , but the other four , which treat respectively of Italian , Flemish , French and Spanish , English and Irish laces , are much less discursive , and about one - third of each chapter is devoted to a reference list which contains brief descriptions of all the principal kinds of lace included in the chapter title .

		` The Lace Book ' must be counted one of the most successful of the holiday publications .

		Another book on the same subject , but quite different in scope , method of treatment , and mechanical features , is Mr.
Samuel L. Golden	PERSON	- berg 's manual called ` Lace : Its Origin and His - tory ' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- .

		Mr.
Goldenberg	PERSON	makes no attempt to brush the dust from the early history of lace-making for the delectation of the col - lector or the dilettante .

		His aim is to furnish those whose relation to lace is primarily com - mercial with a simple but comprehensive treatise that will fit them to judge of lace , and serve as a practical guide in times of doubt .

		However , in spite of his very matter-of-fact attitude , he has found it impossible entirely to dissociate lace from its makers and wearers , or to get rid of all the romance that inevitably colors the sub - ject .

		Mr.
Goldenberg	PERSON	's book is practical with - out being dull ; his information is summary and straight to the point ; his tables of ` Characteris - tics of the Different Types of Lace , ' which occu - py two-thirds of the book , are complete , well - arranged , and explicit .

		This publication is of course not so sumptuous as ` The Lace Book , ' but it is neat and attractive , and there are an abundance of well-printed plates .

		Probably no other city in the world presents so kaleidoscopic a combination of pulsing modem life , historical associations , and mediaeval romance as
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		In his book entitled ` Imperial
Vienna	LOCATION	' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr ,
A. S. Levetus	PERSON	attempts to give his readers at least a glimpse of each of the city 's manifold interests and activities .

		One notable thing about the book is the fact that it is comprehensive without being barren , -- an unusual combination , as readers of guide-books can attest .

		Another striking feature is its wealth of illustration , furnished by
Herr Erwin Puch	PERSON	- inger , whose interesting sketches of the architec - ture of the oity and some of its street types form a delightful record of impressions , besides being a vivid commentary on the text .

		They are from sketches in charcoal , pencil , j > en-and-ink , and wash , so that there is plenty of variety in method of treatment as well as in subject-mattei ' .

		Mr.
Levetus	PERSON	acknowledges special indebtedness to the Austrian Emperor , who gave author and illustrator permission to visit the
Hofburg	LOCATION	and other palaces for the purj > ose of making observa - tions and drawings .

		This fact adds a special interest to the chapters about Austrian court life and ceremony .

		A number of chapters are devoted to old
Vienna	LOCATION	, several to picturesque historical incidents such as the visit of
Napoleon	PERSON	, others treat of the magnificent galleries that house the national collections of painting and sculpture , of the musical and dramatic interests of the city , its universities , its society , and the life of its people .

		The cover design is very handsome , and the tinted paper attractive .

		Three toast books offer a wide field of choice to the seeker for after-dinner wit and wisdom .

		428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, A very substaaitial and systematic collection is * Toasts and Tributes , ' edited by Mr.
Arthur Gray	PERSON	, and published by Messrs.
Rohde	PERSON	& Has - kins .

		As its name suggests , it contains not only formal toasts , but also quotable sentiments .

		There is a short essay on the origin of toasts by the editor ; another about the responsibilities of the toast-master by Mr.
Allan Forman	PERSON	, and some epigrammatic post-prandial philosophy contrib - uted by
Creswell Maclaughlin	PERSON	.

		These writers and others furnish a few original toasts , but the main strength of the volume lies in its large collection of standard quotations , conveniently arranged under twenty-five different headings and carefully indexed by subjects and authors .

		A few blank pages are left at the end of the book for the entry of original toasts or those heard at dinners .

		The volume is printed with rubricated title-page and running-heads and ornamental chapter-headings , and is bound in gay colors .

		-- In lighter vein , wittier , and more strictly a toast-book , but , on the other hand , less com - plete and substantial , is the volume entitled ` Prosit . '

		It is issued by
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the auspices of the
Spinner 's Club	ORGANIZATION	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, who think that the state of the vine is the fitting place whence a toast-book should emanate .

		The
California	LOCATION	writers have contributed a number of original toasts and col - lected others , ancient and modem , including a few in foreign languages .

		Among the best of the newer ones is Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's ' A health to the man on trail
this night	TIME	; may his grub hold out ; may his dogs keep their legs ; may his matches never miss fire . '

		The canvas cover shows an ingenious design by Mr.
Gordon Ross	PERSON	, who also furnishes a very bibulous frontispiece .

		-- The third book , `
Waes Hael	PERSON	, ' written and compiled by Miss
Edithe Lea Chase	PERSON	and Capt.
W. E. P. French	PERSON	, and published by the
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	, seems rather more representative than ` Prosit , ' and equally clever and up-to-date .

		Among its novel features are the tiny beer stein attached to the ribbon marker , the ` apology ' in the form of a very clever parody of Kipling , and the grouping of the toasts according to the man - ner in which they should most appropriately be drunk .

		For example , toasts to Humanity ,
America	LOCATION	, the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and the Flag are to be quaffed ` In
Bumpers	PERSON	' ; the army and navy are to be toasted ` In Red Wine ' ; sweethearts , wives and mothers , love and marriage need ` The Lov - ing Cup ' ; wine and revelry are to be drunk ` From the Flowing Bowl ' ; the professions and such abstractions as music , literature , science , and wit , go down ` In Mixed Ale ' ; while toasts to ` The Day After , ' ` The Men Who Lost , ' death and parting , use up ` The Lees of the Wine Cup . '

		There are some fourteen hundred toasts in the book , about one-third of which are new and origi - nal .

		The long list of toasts to colleges and to states of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	will prove acceptable to harassed toast-masters .

		The book is carefvdly indexed and attractively printed and bound .

		This year 's additions to
Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's ` Photogravure Series ' of books of travel are `
France	LOCATION	: Historic and Romantic , ' in two volumes , and `
Switzerland	LOCATION	: Pietui-esque and Descriptive ' in one volume , both being the work of Mr.
Joel Cook	PERSON	.

		They belong to the systematic , orderly , and objective class of trav - elers ' guides , and embody more detail than is essential to any except those persons who con - template a journey through the countries described .

		For this latter class , Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's volumes would prove excellent preparatory read - ing , and would serve equally well as guide-books , -- though they are rather too heavy to can-y about comfortably .

		Copious indices and descrip - tive running-heads make the contents available for hasty reference .

		The book about
France	LOCATION	opens with a chapter on the English Channel , wherein all the ports and places of interest on both shores are noted and described .

		Next comes the journey to
Paris	LOCATION	by several different routes , then a full description of the capital city and its environs .

		The remainder of the work describes vai-ious journeys from
Paris	LOCATION	; south to
Provence	LOCATION	and the Rhone valley , and to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and the
Riviera	LOCATION	, west into
Britanny	LOCATION	, southwest to the
Bay of Biscay	ORGANIZATION	and the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	, and northeast into
Flanders	PERSON	and
Belgium	LOCATION	, the last - named country being included because of its similarity to
France	LOCATION	in geography , language , and history .

		It seems as if Mr.
Cook	PERSON	had neglected nothing in the way of either historic or romantic associations which could enrich his work .

		About fifty photogravure illustrations display the art , architecture , and landscape of the country .

		The volume on
Switzerland	LOCATION	includes the Rhine trip , which is generally combined by American visi - tors with the regular Swiss tour .

		The method of treatment is the same as in the other volumes , except that while legend and history get equal attention , scenic description naturally gets more , both in text and pictures .

		Western
Switzerland	LOCATION	, eastern `
Switzerland	LOCATION	, the
Upper Rhine	LOCATION	, the Mid - dle Rhine and Main , the great Rhine Gorge , and the Lower Rhine are the six divisions of the tour .

		The volumes are handsomely bound , and each work is protected by cloth slip covers and a substantial cloth case .

		Mr ,
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	and his camera have in past years journeyed together through
France	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
New England	LOCATION	, This year they have chosen to stay in
America	LOCATION	again , and have spent their time exploring some ` Highways and Byways of the South . '

		^ The records of the expedition have been made into a handsome volume , plentifully illustrated from the author 's photographs , and very prettily bound , bearing the imprint of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As usual , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has avoided the bustle of towns and cities ; he gives no facts about the commercial progress of the New South , and takes no side on the race question .

		Instead he rambles through the woods and fields , stops for the night at isolated hamlets or lonely farmhouses , and describes the scenes along the way and the peo - ple he meets in his journeyings .

		Chapters like ` The Birthplace of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, ' `
John Brown	PERSON	's Town , ' or ` Way Down upon the
Suwanee River	LOCATION	' have an incidental historic or romantic interest , and so have many of the pictures ; but the main
1904	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		429 purpose of the book is to describe the unspoiled iTiral life of a picturesque part of
America	LOCATION	-- the most picturesque part , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	calls it , and he ought to be a good judge .

		His studies of types like the
Georgia	LOCATION	` Cracker ' and the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountaineer are sympathetic and full of humor .

		Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	is never at a loss for a subject on which to compile a volume of • extracts by well-known authors .

		This year she lias chosen to deal with ` Famous Women , ' limit - ing the very elastic adjective by making it refer to women who have wielded an appreciable political influence .

		The list of such women of • course includes many sovereigns , queens of the left hand , mistresses of salons whose interest in politics was intellectual , women like the Duchesses • de Longueville and du
Maine	LOCATION	who plunged into ■ civil strife for the love of intrigue , and a few like
Agnes Sorel	PERSON	and
Joan	PERSON	of Arc whose sense ■ of duty led them into the political arena .

		Of the forty women included by far the greater num - ber are French , and all but a very few of the rast are English .

		The selections , which deal • chiefly with the political career of each subject , are chosen with a view to variety and pictur -
$ squeness	MONEY	as well as accuracy , and like all Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's compilations ` Famous Women as Described by
Great Writers	ORGANIZATION	' is interesting read - ing .

		A portrait of each famous woman stands before the sketch of her career .

		The binding is uniform with the rest of Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's works .

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Another book about famous French women is ` Miss
Geraldine Broolcs	PERSON	's ` Dames and Daughters of the French Court ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		But instead of treating her celebrities as founders of salons or as political and social leaders .

		Miss
Brooks	PERSON	writes of their intimate family life , showing them liter - ally as ` dames and daughters ' in their own homes .

		With this point in view , she has chosen from the innumerable characters at her disposal ten of the most natural and lovable -- those that will `` tand close scrutiny and repay close acquaintance .

		All of them have been written about many times before , some by so discriminating an analyst of human nature as Sainte-Beuve ; but
Miss Brooks	ORGANIZATION	's original and very American point of view and her fresh and racy style throw a new light upon her subjects .

		Portraits reproduced from famous paintings and a cheerful cover give a holiday air to the book .

		Pai-ody , particularly clever parody , is so rare nowadays that one opens Miss Myrtle Reed 's '' ` Book of Clever Beasts ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , further described on the title page as ' Studies in
Unnatu	LOCATION	- ral History , ' with a lively expectation of joys to come , which fortunately is not doomed to dis - appointment .

		The tales purport to be written by Mr.
Johnson-Sitdown	PERSON	, a telegraph operator , who is compelled by ill health to return to ' Nature , and resolves to make the most of his enforced vacation in approved modern fashion Tjy writing up his experiences .

		Little Upsidaisi , a field-mouse ,
Kitchi-Kitchi	PERSON	, a red squirrel .

		Jagg the Skootaway goat ,
Snoof	PERSON	, the big bear that lives off the garbage heap at the Geyser Hot ^ l ,
Jenny Ragtail	PERSON	and
Jim Crow	PERSON	, will at once suggest their originals to anybody who keeps up with the products of the Long-Seton-Roberts school .

		Little Upsidaisi communicates with Mr.
Johnson-Sitdown	PERSON	by means of the
Morse	PERSON	code , which unfortunately is also intelligible to Tom -
Tom	PERSON	, the pet cat of the hermitage ;
Jim Crow	PERSON	sets his own broken leg in a clay cast ; and the other ` clever beasts ' perform feats equally marvellous .

		Miss Reed is a daring pimster , as well as an ingenious fabulist .

		Not content merely to enter - tain her readers with animal stories , she keeps up a running comment -- or , rather , makes Mr.
Johnson-Sitdown	PERSON	do so -- upon the exigencies of the literary life and upon modem literary and scientific -LRB- or pseudo-scientific -RRB- methods .

		Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	's nine pictures of the clever beasts add the finishing touch of drollery to the book .

		` Yosemite Legends ' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of the most original and artistic of the smaller holiday publications .

		The text consists of six short legends , eaeh relating the substance of some ancient folk-song of the Ah-wah-nee-chee Indians , who dwelt in the Yosemite valley until the tribes of the pale-face drove them out .

		One of the legends tells how the Yosemite Fall got its name ; another explains why the Indians fear the Bridal Veil ; a third reveals the origin of the pointed rock that sticks up in the cliff between the
fall	DATE	and the canon of the Arrow-wood .

		There is a weird legend of Mirror Lake , and a bit of history about the three sons of the last great chief of the Ah-wah-nee-chee , who were captured at the Oase of the triple peak called thereafter ` The
Three Brothers	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The stories are admirably related by Miss
Bertha H. Smith	PERSON	, who succeeds in transcribing the impressiveness , the sense of mystery , and the barbaric poetry of the originals into her carefully finished and dramatic little sketches .

		Miss
Florence Lundborg	PERSON	, the illus - trator , has furnished a dozen full-page wash - drawings of a mystical , impressionistic sort , showing the valley as it might appear to the awed and frightened tribesman who has fallen under the spell of the legends .

		These drawings are reproduced in color , as are the marginal decorations , whose curious patterns suggest the designs of Indian pottery and baskets .

		` Kitty of the Roses ' is the sentimental little romance of a young architect who found the lady of his dreams in a rose-garden , had to leave her before he had more than found her , just failed to see her again before she sailed for
Algiers	LOCATION	, and at last caught her once for all in the rose - garden .

		Roses , pink , white , and red , riot through the story , which is simply and prettily told .

		Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	is the author , Mr.
Frederic J. von Rapp	PERSON	the illustrator , and the
J. B. Lippin	PERSON	-
cott Co.	ORGANIZATION	the publishers .

		The pink cloth cover is stamped in gold , with a gold border framing a vignette of
Kitty	LOCATION	, -- a form of cover decoration that seems to be very popular this season .

		The illustrations are tinted , and the page margins are filled with long-stemmed roses .

		` The Entirely New Cynic 's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for
1905	DATE	' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- appvears in the same familiar gingham cover , with the same familiar and fantastic decorations in 480 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, red and black , as in previous issues ; but this year the twisted proverbs and the illustrations accompanying them are all new .

		Possibly this second crop of cynicism is not quite so fresh and sparkling as the first , but it is still sprightly enough to be very entertaining to cynics and others .

		There is really no reason for fault-find - ing when we get a number of new proverbs as good as these : ` Actresses will happen in the best regulated families , ' and ` You will never miss water while the Champagne runs dry . '

		Mr ,
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's preface , ` To the World at Large , ' is one of the best things in the book , and his picture called ` The First
Monday	DATE	' is another irresistible bit of fooling .

		Mr.
Herford	PERSON	and his collaborators .

		Miss
Ethel Watts Mum	PERSON	- ford and Mr.
Addison Mizner	PERSON	, are putting all cynics in their debt by showing up the profession in so genial and pleasing a light . '

		Gilhooleyisms ' is a little book of observations about life , made by ` Lord
Gilhooley	PERSON	' -LRB- otherwise Mr.
Frederick H. Seymour	PERSON	-RRB- and illustrated by Mr.
Tom Fleming	PERSON	, The epigrams vaiy greatly in merit , their worst faults being that they generally take themselves too seriously and oc - casionally incline to triteness .

		` There are people who make themselves so ridiculous , living , that they are not forgfotten when dead , ' just misses being very good ; so does ` The genius does one thing too well , and other things not well enough , ' These are fair samples of the book 's quality .

		We should like the observations better without the pictures , which emphasize the luipleasant cynicism of the text without adding to it either humor or point .

		-LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	. -RRB-

		Of the same general sort , but cleverer and much better illustrated , is a little book of ` Com - pleted Proverbs ' -LRB- Coates -RRB- , by Mr.
L. de V	PERSON	,
Matthewman	PERSON	, ' `` True love is grounded on es - teem , '' but esteem rests upon no foundation , ' * `` Man proposes '' when woman so pennits , ' ' `` Live within yoiu ' means , '' if you have any means of doing so , ' -- these excerpts will give an idea of the satirical-humorous treatment of the proverbs .

		They are genuinely illustrated and greatly improved by the pictures , which are witty and suggestive .

		These are the work of Mr.
Clare Victor Dwiggins	PERSON	, who has collaborated with Mr.
Matthewman	PERSON	in previous volumes .

		` Flower Fables and Fancies ' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
N. Hudson Moore	PERSON	, is a sort of modernized , expanded , and de-sentimentalized version of the chapter on the language of flowers that always found a place in the ` Friendship 's Offerings ' of our grandmothers .

		It contains a vast amount of pleasantly diversified information about flow - ers , references to them in English poetry and Greek or oriental myth , explanations of the odd conceits involved in local nomenclature , quaint superstitions about flowers , their religious sym - bolism , their medicinal uses , the lore of perfumes , the rites of May-day and other floral festivals , glimpses of old-time gardens , and occasionally a curious bit of botanical information , or the his - tory of a floral mania like the tulip fad in Hol - land .

		The book is prettily gotten up , with tinted floral borders in various colors , a number of illustrations from photographs , and a dainty cover .

		Mr.
John Uri Lloyd	PERSON	's latest story , `
Scroggins	PERSON	, ' is published by
Messrs	ORGANIZATION	,
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co	ORGANIZATION	, in a handsome holiday edition , illustrated and deco - rated by Mr.
Reginald B. Birch	PERSON	.

		Scroggins is a Rocky Mountain stage-driver , who , finding him - self suddenly a millionaire , first tries to spend his money and then goes back to his old home and gives it away , finally returning happily to the box-seat of the Gulch stage .

		The plot is - perfectly conventional , but there is a good deal of pathos in the telling , and much sound sense in the old stage-driver 's philosophy of life .

		The cover , which simulates birch bark , with a pan - elled view of the Rockies set in across the top , , is unique and effective .

		Of all the so-called pocket editions , the ` Vest Pocket Series ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is probably the small - est , being literally tiny enough to slip conveni - ently into the receptacle indicated by its name .

		The text is printed lengthwise on the page , thus making it possible to use fairly large type with - out the necessity of breaking the lines of vei `` se .


Goldsmith	PERSON	's ` Deserted Village , '
Browning	PERSON	's ` Pied
Piper	ORGANIZATION	' and ` The Last Ride ' -LRB- in one vol - ume -RRB- ,
Tennyson	PERSON	's `
Locksley Hall	PERSON	, ' and Bums 's `
Tam O'Shanter	PERSON	' and ` The
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	' -LRB- the last two furnished with glossaries -RRB- , are some of the titles from which the man who wants a pocket companion -- and the woman , too , if she can lay claim to a pocket -- may make a choice .

		The little books open easily , and are bound in flexible morocco of vaiious colors .

		There is no end to editions of the Rubaiyat .

		A new one , which will interest the Omar cult because of its pictures , is offered by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains
Edward FitzGer	PERSON	- ald 's original preface and is illustrated by twelve photogi'avures after the drawing of Mr.
Gilbert James	PERSON	.

		Omarians who care for the
Vedder	PERSON	illustrations will find Mr.
James	PERSON	's inteipretations monotonous , lacking both in imagination and dra - matic quality .

		They all picture the poet and the lady to whom he sings , thus limiting their scope to the poet 's action and feeling instead of to the action and feeling of the poem .

		As the poster style precludes characterization , there is little left for the artist to strive for except graceful composition and a Persian setting .

		These he certainly secures , and his designs , though they miss the subtler suggestions of the poem , are exceedingly decorative .

		A new volume in Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's ` Flowers of Parnassus ' series of bibelots is
William Morris	ORGANIZATION	's `
Defence of Guenevere	ORGANIZATION	, ' with six illusti'ations by Miss
Jessie M. King	PERSON	.

		Last winter Mr.
Lane	PERSON	published this poem , with a number of Moriis 's shorter pieces , in a regulation-sized volume , which Miss King illustrated ; and the pictures in the present edition appear to be reduced from those in the larger one .

		In this miniature size they ai'e very dainty , and the little book will make the best sort of Christmas greeting for a friend Avho cares for
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		THE DIAL 431 ` The Wandering Host ' is a forceful little alle - gory by Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, published in holiday form , with decorative borders and a pretty cover , by the
American Unitariaji Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation .

		The text was first printed several years ago under the title of ` The Story of the Innum - erable Company , ' by which name some readers may remember it .

		The present edition is revised and slightly enlarged .

		We do not see any reason ' why President
Jordan	PERSON	's singularly ' direct and vigorous style should mask itself in symbolism , and we like him better in '' The Call of the Twen - tieth Century ' than in this , allegorical argument for individualism in the moral and religious life .

		Nevertheless , his points are w ` ell taken , and i his logic sound and convincing beneath the figurative dress .

		In the ` Art Gift-book Series , ' of the
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with its pretty and unusual bind - ing and tinted marginal decorations , come two little books , ` Divided , the Story of a Poem , ' by Miss
Clara Laughlin	PERSON	, and `
Gwen	PERSON	, an Idyll of the Canyon , ' by
Ralph Connor	PERSON	.

		` Divided , ' which has already appeared in one of the magazines , is the story of a lonely and sentimental ' little girl , who happened upon an illustrated copy bf
Jean Inge	PERSON	- low 's poero .

		of ` Divided , ' liked its pictures , pored over its symbolism , and finally grasped its mean - ing by living through the same sad experience herself .

		Like all
Miss Laughlin	LOCATION	's work , this story is a piece of special pleading , -- a reminder that fame and a career , however splendid , are not worth the loss of love .

		It is simply and graphically written , and is well suited to its present tasteful setting .

		`
Gwen	PERSON	, ' dedicated ` to all who question the Why of human pain , ' is an episode taken from
Ralph Connor	PERSON	's popular novel , ` The Sky Pilot . '

		Standing by itself , it makes a vivid and convincing study of the Pilot 's wonderful power , and is just the gift with vsrhich to brighten the Christmas of a sad or sick fri # ndw The marginal drawings are clever and stxg - gestive .

		An illustrated holiday edition of Mr ,
Hamil	PERSON	- ton
Wright Mabie	PERSON	's ` Parables of Life ' is pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with four new alle - gories added and eight drawings by Mr.
W. Benda	PERSON	reproduced in photogravure .

		We like these parables as well as anything that Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	has written lately .

		The imagery is grace ^ ful ' and sufficiently transparent , without being conventional , the movement rapid , and the thoughts vital , incisive , and inspiring .

		Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- da 's drawings are quite in the spirit of the text , as well as being artistic in themselves and well reproduced .

		Among the calendars for the new year those issued by Mr.
Alfred Bartlett	PERSON	are as usual dis - tinguished for their artistic designs and well selected quotations .

		The most novel among them is the small ' ^ Sepia Calendar , ' decorated with six landscapes from drawings by Miss
Helen Sin	PERSON	- clair
Patterson	PERSON	, These are printed on the calen - dar sheets directly from photographic negatives , , and a touch of color is added by hand , making an original and pleasing effect .

		One of the least pretentious of Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	's publications is ' A Calendar of Inspiration , ' gotten up in his char - acteristic style with decorative borders and initials , and old English lettering , ahd printed in black and red .

		There are two ' sheets to the month , each containing a .

		-LRB- Quotation from Such masters of hope and ^ ood cheer as
Stevenson	PERSON	^ Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	,
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	,
Enierson	LOCATION	, and
David	PERSON	Swing ; Similar in spirit and make-up , but larger and more elaborately colored , and decorated , is ` The
House of Life	ORGANIZATION	' calendar .

		The quotations are of the same inspiring type , but less familiar .

		Six of the twelve sheets are printed in sepia and purple , the rest in sepia and ochre .

		The ` Calendar of Prayers by
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	' is not new , but the
1905	DATE	edition appears in four colors , every other page being done in green and gold .

		To say that the decora - tive setting ; which suggests the pages of an illuminated missal , is beautiful enciugh for the prayers is high praise , but no more than is deserved .

		` The
St. Cecilia Calendar	ORGANIZATION	' is a single sheet , with a picture of the saint and a border around picture and calendar , for decoration .

		-- * A Book of Days ' is the title of a calendar issued by the
Young People 's Religious Union	ORGANIZATION	, a Uni - tarian society .

		Each page contains the calendar for a week , with seven quotations taken from the tporks of some prominent Unitarian .

		There is no lack of good material for such a calendar , and in the present instance excellent use has been made ot jt .

		The calendar is tied up with green coyd , is printed in green , and is bound in a green and gold cover .

		-- Decidedly imique and as pretty as we always expect Japanese work to be , is a series of Japanese ealenda.rs published in
Tokj	ORGANIZATION	' O by
T. Hasegawa	PERSON	, Two of the most elaborate are in the form of an oblong case or pocket prettily , decorated .

		Into this slips a packet of twelve sheets , which can be sorted to get the current nipnth uppermost .

		Each sheet shows a Japanese print , the designs in the smaller of the two calen - dars being mostly landscapes and flowers , and in the larger consisting of street scenes and characteristic bits of Japanese life .

		The - ` Pagoda C ^ ilendar ' is made up of twelve crosswise ' sec - tidnp , which spread out td form a fascinating ^ many-storied pagoda , wi ^ h quaint little figures perched on its various balconies .

		Three booklet calendars show respectively the flowers of the Japanese year , the landscapes of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, and ` the months of Japanese children . '

		The pictures in the last-named booklet suggest that life is one long and amusing holiday for Japanese boys and girls .

		Most unique of all is the ' Calendar in Japanese Towels . '

		An introduction es ^ plains tl ^ is ^ t according to Japanese standards every household utensil mast be decorative as well as iiseful , and that the patterns on , towels are almost as varied ^ beautiful , and full of symbolism as the patterns On china or screens .

		Having looked through the calendar , each page of which has for its baek-i ground a towel pattern .

		We are ready to credit this statement .

		-- Very gaudy in comparison • Vvith the dainty Japanese calendars just mentioned are three published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	` The
Coon Calendar	ORGANIZATION	' is conceived along , the lines of broad caricature , the twelve large And brightly colored pictures being accompanied ' by verses in negro dialect describing the various 432 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, types .

		` Gems from the Poets ' is a floral calen - dar , or rather a series of flower pictxires , each accompanied by a ` gem ' on the general floral theme .

		The calendai * proper is a mere accessory , and is contained in a small appendage fastened by ribbons to the large sheets .

		The ` Friendship Calendar ' contains twelve quotations from a wide range of authors .

		The borders and initials are in colors , and are fairly artistic in design .

		Books for the
Young	ORGANIZATION	.

		n. Judging from the few books remaining for con - sideration in this second of our two articles devoted to the children 's books of the present season , it would seem that the output this year has been at once more forward and less prolific than for several seasons past .

		But the residue with which we have now to deal contains a number of books of more than ordinary merit .

		Especially praiseworthy are several new editions or new adaptations of books that have gladdened the hearts of past generations , and these will have our first attention .

		.

		It is doubtful if many children will n ^ covert ^ ® ^ ^ ^ ® ** ^ appreciate fully the charm of the setting in which is offered to them the series of ` Stories from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Plays ' -LRB- Dent-Dutton . -RRB-

		These dainty volumes have all the outward characteristics of the well-known `
Temple Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' being issued in the same convenient form , with the same beauty of typog - raphy and binding , and possessing the added attraction of graceful illustrations .

		The stories are retold , simply and sensibly , by Mrs.
Alice Spencer Hoffman	PERSON	, with the aid of plentiful extracts from the plays themselves .

		Two vol - umes have so far appeared : ` The Tempest , ' illustrated by Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	, and ` King Eichard II. , ' with drawings by Miss
Dora Curtis	PERSON	.

		-- Of special distinction also is the handsome new edition of Mrs.
Anna Jameson	PERSON	's ` Shakespeare 's Heroines ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The text requires no comment at this time ; it need only be said that Mr.
W. Paget	PERSON	has illustrated the book most sumptuously , his six full - page pictures in color and seventy drawings in half - tone leaving little to be desired .

		-- Prof.
U. Waldo Cutler	PERSON	has utilized the wealth of splendid material in Sir
Thomas Malory	PERSON	's ` Morte d `
Arthur	PERSON	' for his volume of ' Stories of King
Arthur	PERSON	and his Knights ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Simplification of both the narrative and the language in which it is told have been con - stantly in the editor 's mind , and the result is a book unusually attractive to children .

		-- A somewhat similar service has been performed for another old favorite in the ' Stories of
Robin Hood	PERSON	and his Merry Outlaws ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
J. Walker McSpadden	PERSON	.

		The old ballads are the sources from which the several tales have been derived , and stanzas from them preface every chapter .

		This book and the one just mentioned are issued in uniform style in the series of ` Children 's Favor - ite Classics , ' with colored frontispieces and other illustrations .

		There is not much poetry , as distin - aTd ^ old ^ ^ ^ guished from mere jingle , among the children 's books this year , but the little that there is deserves prominent mention .

		Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge	PERSON	has prepared a new and enlarged edition of her ` Rhymes and Jingles ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , known to younger readers for thirty years past .

		The pieces newly included show no trace of their author 's more than three score years , but are as fresh and youthful as their predecessors of a long generation ago .

		The book has been beautifully illustrated and decorated by Miss
Sarah S. Stilwell	PERSON	, in a style uniform with Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	's pictorial setting of ' A Child 's Garden of Verses . '

		--
Miss Stilwell	PERSON	has also designed the pictures for Miss
Katharine Pyle	PERSON	's ` Childhood ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , using a combination of delicate reds and blacks , and achieving marked success .

		The verses are tender and graceful , and of more merit than usually goes to the entertainment of American children .

		-- The poems of the late Blanche Mary
Channing	PERSON	have been posthumously collected , and are published in a pretty little book called ' Lullaby Castle and Other Poems ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		More than half of the poems in the collection are intended for children , and they possess a delicacy of feeling which deserves to make them widely known .

		-- An excellent book in everything but name is the quarto volume entitled ` Babies ' Classics ' -LRB- Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which are brought together some two score poems for children by standard authors .

		The compiler .

		Miss
Lilia Scott MacDonald	PERSON	, has made a most intelligent selection , including a number of old-time favorites by such forgotten writers as
Jane	PERSON	and
Ann Taylor	PERSON	and
Mary Howitt	PERSON	.

		The illustrations by Mr.
Arthur Hughes	PERSON	are nothing less than a rare artistic treat .

		Among books having to do with 8cho `` lUfe school and college life , the collection 00 ije .

		^ ^ short stories brought together by Mr.
Arthur Stanwood	PERSON	Pier under the collective title of ' Boys of
St. Timothy	ORGANIZATION	's ' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deserves high praise .

		The school concerned is that of
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	's of
Southborough	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and the deeds of its youth are set forth in a series of entertaining episodes .

		Most of these , but not all , are concerned with athletic sports and the playing fields , and all are instinct with the spirit of honorable competi - tion .

		The book is cleverly illustrated by various hands .

		-- A service somewhat similar to that of Mr.
Pier	PERSON	's for
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	's has been done for
Phillips Exeter Academy	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Albertus T	PERSON	,
Dudley	PERSON	in his story called ` Making the Nine ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The interest of the book , as the title indicates , is with baseball .

		It shows the spiritual side of a game which Americans hold in too little esteem , describing how a lad both young and slight wins his way to a place on the school nine by the patient development of every manly quality , -- If Mr ,
Leslie W. Quirk	PERSON	had not been quite so eager to make his hero heroic , his story called ` Baby Elton , Quarter-Back ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- would take equal rank with the two just mentioned .

		It deals with a boy 's freshman year in college , and gives him an amount of glory that is almost overwhelm - ing .

		It is a well-told story , nevertheless , with plenty of exciting incidents .

		-- '
Helen Grant	PERSON	's Friends ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has to do with a young person whom Miss
Amanda M. Douglas	PERSON	has already made familiar to us in a previous book called `
Helen Grant	PERSON	's Schooldays . '

		The new story describes how the heroine won her way through a secondary school with the help -LRB- and occasional hindrance -RRB- of her numerous friends .

		-- Miss
Amy Brooks	PERSON	also brings a familiar figure to the front once more in ` Dorothy Dainty at School ' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Dorothy 's mild adventures at
Aunt Charlotte	LOCATION	's educational institution are eclipsed in interest by the much more thrilling experiences of little
Nancy Ferris	PERSON	, who is kidnapped and made to dance upon the stage .

		1904 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 433 stories of home life .

		A little brother and sister living with their deserted and unhappy mother come down very late Christmas Eve and surprise a real
Santa Claus	LOCATION	; who turns out to be their father , returned from long wanderings restored to moral sanity and in possession of great wealth .

		This is the situation described in Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's tale called ` Mr.
Kris Kringle	PERSON	, ' now published in a new edition by Messrs.
George W. Jacobs	PERSON	& Go .

		The pictures , by Mr.
Clyde O. DeLand	PERSON	, are thoroughly harmonious with the atmos - phere of the charming little story .

		-- A book with the genuine holiday flavor is Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	's '
Kristy	PERSON	's Queer Christmas ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Little
Kristy	PERSON	gathers a number of interesting grown folk about a great hearth fir ' ^ on Christmas evening in order to have them describe the most wonderful thing that ever happened to each of them on that wonderful day .

		The result is a series of tales which cover pretty much all of
America	LOCATION	in scene , and which are in turn heroic , thrilling , and humorous .

		-- The scene of ' Dandelion Cottage ' -LRB- Holt -RRB- is laid by its author .

		Miss
Carroll Watson Kankin	PERSON	, in northern
Michigan	LOCATION	, where a number of girls and an occasional boy work out their destiny in what had been the rectory of the small town .

		The story is one of difficulties bravely overcome , and the humor of the tale is well borne out in the pictures by
Florence Scovel Shinn	PERSON	and
Elizabeth E. Finley	PERSON	.

		-- To escape treatment more rigid than kind the heroine of Miss
Harriet A. Cheever	PERSON	's ` Lou ' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- runs away from the insti - tution in which she had been placed as an orphan , and finds happiness at the end of her long journey .

		-- How a small middle-class
London	LOCATION	lad wins his way to the esteem of his elder brothers is told most attractively by Mr.
B. A. Clarke	PERSON	in ` Minnows and Tritons ' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the little chap having the most exhilarating adventures with wild animals and robbers during the process .

		The second volume of Mr.
Edward S. oradvenZre	PERSON	^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ' ^ ` Colonial Series ' is called ` Cromwell of
Virginia	LOCATION	: A Story of
Bacon	LOCATION	's Eebellion ' -LRB- Coatee -RRB- , and it utilizes afresh some of the characters of ` An American King , ' published last year .

		An interesting struggle indi - cative of the high spirit of the settlers which was eventually to win them independence occupies the narrative .

		-- How a small family of boys and girls defended their home in their father 's absence dur - ing the last French and Indian war makes the exciting topic of Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	's ` Defending the
Island	LOCATION	: A Story of Bar Harbor in
1758	DATE	' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		-- A new volume in the ` Holly Tree Series ' is Mr.
H. Irving Hancock	PERSON	's ` Chuggins , the Youngest Hero in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	: A Tale of the Capture of
Santiago	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Altemus	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a convincing account of what befell a lad of thirteen who wished to fight because his ancestors had , and who made his way to
Cuba	LOCATION	as a stowaway .

		The colored frontispiece and other illustrations are by Mr.
J. C. Claghorn	PERSON	.

		-- We come almost to contemporary affairs in Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	's ` Under the
Mikado	LOCATION	's Flag ; or ,
Young Soldiers of Fortune	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The boy heroes already known to readers of previous vol - umes in Mr.
Stratemeyer	PERSON	's ` Old Glory Series ' are in
Korea	LOCATION	when the present war with
Russia	LOCATION	breaks forth , and they follow the fortunes of the Japanese through the battle of Liao-Yang .

		It would be a queer sort of child indeed that could resist the charm of the little animal books written and illustrated in color by Miss
Beatrix Potter	PERSON	.

		` The Tale of Benjamin Bunny ' and ` The Tale of Two Bad Mice ' are the titles of this year 's additions to the Oood books of all sorts , list .

		For smaller children nothing more delightful in their own unique way could possibly be found .

		Messrs.
F. Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the series .

		-- Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	's cheerful and fascinating Goops reappear this season in a volume comprehensively entitled ` Goop Tales Alphabetically Told : A Study of the Behavior of some Fifty-Two Individuals , Each of which , while Mainly Virtuous , yet has some One Human and Redeeming Fault ' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		While children can hardly fail to enjoy the peculiar Goop characteristics , we fancy that Mr ,
Burgess	PERSON	's clever drawings and verses will make their strong - est appeal to the ' grown-up . '

		-- A book of fairy tales from the versatile pen of the late
Thomas Dunn	PERSON	English is among the pleasant surprises of the sea - son .

		It is called ` The Little Giant , The
Big Dwarf	ORGANIZATION	, and Two Other Wonder Tales ' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , and is addressed to ` boys and girls from eight to eighty years old . '

		The ` two other ' tales are ` The Four Rescues ' and ` The Adventures of
Wydawayk	LOCATION	, ' this last now appearing in print for the first time .

		Ail the stories are quaint and humorous in the best sense of those words , and their effect is greatly heightened by the graceful drawings of Mrs.
Lucy Fitch Perkins	PERSON	.

		-- Another admirable book intended for small children is Mrs.
Mary Austin	PERSON	's ` The Basket Woman ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which are told a number of fanciful tales based upon Indian myths of the
California	LOCATION	desert .

		The book is marked throughout by imagination and literary skill , and the whole effect is delightful .

		-- Mrs.
Frances Trego Montgomery	PERSON	's ` On a Lark to the Planets ' -LRB-
Saalfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a sequel to last year 's '
Wonderful Electric Elephant	ORGANIZATION	. '

		In the new book the children take a ballon trip as far as the Milky Way , talk with the classical gods , and have adven - tures many and various before their safe return to earth .

		The illustrations in color are by
Miss Wini	LOCATION	- fred
D. Elrod	PERSON	.

		-- Of the simplest words of one syllable Miss
Clara Murray	PERSON	has composed the little stories in her book called ` The Child at Play ' -LRB- Lit - tle ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The tales are intended for very small children indeed , and there are suitable pic - tures in color by Mr.
Hermann Hayer	PERSON	.

		-- Rev.
Augustus Mendon Lord	PERSON	has written a delightful little account of children all over
Europe	LOCATION	in his book entitled ` The Touch of Nature : Little Stories of Great People ' -LRB-
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Child life in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and many other countries is here described in a way to appeal strongly to the young mind .

		-- Of a simi - lar sort , but going much farther afield in its range , in Miss
Lulu Maude Chance	PERSON	's ` Little Folks of Many Lands ' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		The book is fully illustrated . '

		-- In ` The Story of a Mission Indian ; or , Sunshine in a Dark Place ' -LRB- Badger -RRB- ,
Miss Kathryn Wallace	PERSON	has depicted the life led by the Indian children in the
California	LOCATION	missions before the coming of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	LOCATION	.

		The book will perform a praiseworthy service in telling the shameful truth of the treat - ment accorded these once happy people .

		Dr.
Edward Cannan	PERSON	of
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	has edited for modern students of economics the greatest of all economic classics -- ' An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The text is that of the fifth edition , carefully collated with the others .

		The notes and commen - taries of the editor are judicious and reverential , and are just what the modern student needs as a guide for the study of
Adam Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition is in handsome library form , in two volumes , and is published in this country by Messrs.
