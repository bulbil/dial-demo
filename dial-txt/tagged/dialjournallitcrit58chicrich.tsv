		632 SHERMAN ST. THE LIFE OF
THOMAS B. REED	PERSON	By
Samuel W. McCall	PERSON	From a three-column review in the
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript '' The best thing to say about McCalFs ' Life of
Thomas B. Reed	PERSON	' is that everyone should read it .

		It is quite impossible to dissect and analyze the work .

		As a whole , it gives a complete picture of the man and compels the reader to feel a sense of personal acquaintance and friendship with him .

		Very likely a biography of
Thomas B. Reed	PERSON	more detailed and exhaustive will at some time be written and very likely his speeches will be put before the public with some measure of completeness , but it is not too much to say that '
Tom	PERSON	' Reed will be known by
McCall	PERSON	's book rather than by any other work , however complete .

		Mr.
McCall	PERSON	had many advantages for the undertaking of this work and his selection to prepare it for the Statesmen 's Series was not only a happy but almost an inevitable one .

		He knew Mr.
Reed	PERSON	well and intimately very likely called him '
Tom	PERSON	' certainly he himself was called '
Samuel	PERSON	, ' for Mr.
Reed	PERSON	eschewed the abbreviated form by which his biographer is best known .

		He served in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with him for eight years , delivered the oration at the unveiling of his statue at
Portland	LOCATION	, and , being selected by the family for the writing of the book , has had free access to the family papers .

		The great temptation for a man of Mr.
McCall	PERSON	's scholarship and knowl - edge of the history for the last four decades must have been to overweight the book with the story of public affairs and to lose sight of the work as a biography .

		This temptation has been resisted .

		The running story of parties and politics and measures during Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's public life is admirably but succinctly told , but the main purpose of the book is everywhere in evidence and current affairs are used only as a setting of the picture .

		Moreover , the author has allowed the subject to tell his own story and to create his own impression .

		It would have been an easy matter to cull from letters and speeches of Mr.
Reed	PERSON	and from the numberless anecdotes told about him or attributed to him a book of quadruple the size of the present volume , and it would have been of distinct interest .

		The value of this work , however , is in the admirable selections which have been made and the way in which they illustrate the life story which is being told .

		Nothing is dragged in merely because it is eloquent or witty , but everything is placed in its true position and perspective in the narrative ... The intimacy between Mr.
Reed	PERSON	and Mr.
Long	PERSON	during the long years of their acquaintance is deliciously brought out , and the picture of the table at
The Hamilton	ORGANIZATION	, at which they both sat , is one to stir the imagination of every lover of fun .

		... It would be possible to extend this review almost indefinitely , but it can not be done without injustice to the work itself .

		It should close as it began , with advice to read the work itself .

		To those whose knowl - edge of public affairs embraces the eighties and nineties , the book will be of delightfully reminiscent value .

		In reading it they will live over two decades in the crucial life of the nation .

		To those who come later , there is history which should not be forgotten and the life-size portrait of a great and many-sided actor in it . ''

Jan. 1 , 1915	DATE	THE WORKS OF
RABINDRANATH TAGORE	PERSON	``
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, the mystic poet of
India	LOCATION	, who in
1913	DATE	was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature , more than any of the preachers , teachers or writers of
Europe	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, has given expression to deep philosophical and religious insight , which is quickened with intellectual honesty and scientific clearness .

		Son of
Abanindranath Tagore	PERSON	, a teacher and artist , and brother of
Dwijendranath Tagore	PERSON	, a philosopher , he belongs to a family which for generations has pro- duced great men .

		In his youth he was surrounded by the influences of literature ^ and music , and in his maturity he has written prose and verse of amazing strength and lyrical beauty .

		He does not in his poetry set the themes of life to great music ; he speaks them in a soft voice to the heart with all the simplicity and directness of power .

		He takes the little in - timate things which comprise life , and fashions them into pearls which reflect the color of the sky , the mightiness of love and life .

		He has vision ; he has intelligence in love , the last test of a man ' * nature . ' '

		26 DEMOCRACY AND THE THEATRE .

		We all wish art to be appreciated by every - body .

		The chief difference of opinion is over the question whether art should be brought down to the many or the many brought up to art .

		Most artists are earnest propagandists of beauty , especially of the beauty they are best able to see and record , but they rarely believe that it is given to more than a few to see beauty in any form .

		They are only less cynical than those popular purveyors of `` amusement '' who despise the public in order that they may not despise themselves .

		But occasionally there comes an artist , or , if not an artist , a playwright , or a critic of the drama , who believes not merely that art and democracy can meet and understand each other but that they have already done so .

		Mr. ``
William C. de Mille	PERSON	, the author of a num - ber of popular melodramas , is such a one .

		In the current issue of `` The Yale Review '' he maintains the thesis that the drama is a demo - cratic art , `` whose first essential is the power of reaching the mass , '' and , hence , that the receipts of the box-office are a measure of the playwright 's skill and power : '' Other arts are for the select few , each appeal - ing to its own comparatively small circle of fol - lowers .

		But the drama is for the many ; it is born not in the academy but in the heart of the great social centre ; it is shaped not by the critic but by the demands of the audience ; it is supported not by endowment and private subscription but by the people acting collectively ; it is housed not in the museum but in buildings maintained by the public for this one purpose .

		It is the only art which the people themselves control , and , through that control , direct ; it is essentially of the people , , by the people , and for the people ; and we should !

		take this function into consideration in any dis - cussion of the art ; for if the drama is to fulfill this basic condition it must be expressed in a form that the mass will accept and support . ''

		... Because the drama is the art of the whole people , it is the art of all arts which can 1 act most strongly upon the people for their devel - opment ; the one art which can really be a great force in the social and intellectual progress of the - race .

		Indeed , the efficiency of drama to accom ^ plish results is absolutely conditional upon its being directed and governed by the mass ; and it follows necessarily that any influence which tends to take the government of drama away from the - THE DIAL , -LRB-
Jan.	DATE	.

		I whole people is an unhealthy influence in that it is undemocratic . ''

		It seems perfectly clear that Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	believes that the drama is not only relatively democratic , as compared with such other arts as prose fiction or music , but absolutely democratic .

		The only danger to the theatre that concerns him is the presence in the com - munity of a class which , `` were it powerful enough , would menace the democracy of dra - matic art as any hierarchy of brains tends to limit progressive thought : '' The ' highbrow ' would take from the people its right of democratic suffrage to compel the pub - lic to vote for plays nominated by the ' machine ' ; and this method of selection would undoubtedly corrupt drama as it does politics . ''

		We are surprised that Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	's politi - cal metaphor does not in the least remind him of the actual conditions which prevail in what he ironically calls the `` commercial '' theatre .

		A play is seldom presented on the commercial stage in this country unless one of the two - score producing managers in
New York	LOCATION	is persuaded that it will pay him to spend
$ 10,000	MONEY	on it .

		Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	may believe that these gentlemen , whose decision is so gener - ally absolute that exceptions to it may be ig - nored as irrelevant , are peculiarly repre - sentative of the American democracy .

		But they suffer no such illusion ; they are frank to admit in their reflective moments that they can not foretell the fate of a play one time out of three ; in a word , that when their sole con - cern is to choose the plays that the public wants they fail far more often than they succeed .

		We might go on to ask Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	how he knows that the box-office receipts of a play are an index of the public 's favor ; how he can be certain that the money in the house is a tribute to the skill of the playwright and not to a matinee idol , or the leading lady 's gowns , or a whim of public opinion .

		But there is a less doubtful point to consider .

		When a play has been accepted by a manager for production it is almost invariably pre - pared in
New York	LOCATION	and presented to a
New York	LOCATION	audience those familiar visits to
New Haven	LOCATION	or
Atlantic City	LOCATION	being in the nature of a dress rehearsal rather than of a pre - miere .

		The first-night audience is notoriously a special one ; and the audiences immediately succeeding , which determine whether a play is to continue in the theatre or leave it for - ever , are only less special ; those who are not the guests of the management are chiefly citi - zens of
New York	LOCATION	who are willing and able to pay
$ 2	MONEY	to see a play about which very little is known .

		No one imagines that these persons are representative of
America	LOCATION	, of a democ - racy in which the average head of a family enjoys an income of perhaps
$ 600	MONEY	or
$ 700	MONEY	a year .

		Can anyone contemplate the process by which a play finally reaches a considerable number of the more prosperous of those Americans who live in or near the cities , and seriously argue that it is a democratic process by which is determined what sort of drama the American people most want ?

		The case for the democracy of prose fiction , or of music , is a good deal stronger .

		A novel is so much more readily accepted for publica - tion than a play for production that many young men who would rather be writing plays turn to fiction on that account alone .

		For one thing , a novel requires only one-tenth the investment on the part of the entrepreneur .

		A novel has a year , or even more , in which to find its audience as against the play 's two weeks , or three .

		A novel , when the fact that a copy can be read by several persons is taken into account , costs the consumer far less than seats in the theatre .

		For that mat - ter , the magazines have made entertainment in the form of prose fiction quite as cheap as entertainment in the form of moving pic - tures .

		The case of music is equally striking .

		Music in the form of grand opera visits only the half-dozen largest cities , and even there is offered only to those who have comfortable incomes ; but music travels wherever a piano , or a gramophone , or a flute may go .

		It might well be argued that music is the most demo - cratic of all the arts , and the one in which the masters are most generally appreciated .

		But no true art is in our day truly democratic .

		Some day a great art and the great multi - tude may come together in the theatre , which has now so little of either .

		In the meantime it ought to be understood that no art which requires the expenditure of any but the small - est sums on the part of those who enjoy it , can be truly democratic in its appeal .

		The art of the theatre among us is not of this descrip - tion and for that reason alone it does not exist for the majority of Americans .

		It is now , as it has always been except under the most extraordinary conditions in the past , the privilege of the few to go to the theatre .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL .

		DOST01EFFSKY .

		Those of us who feel that the best modern fiction has been written in
Russia	LOCATION	are pro- foundly grateful to Mrs.
Garnett	PERSON	.

		She has given us Tourguenieff and
Tolstoi	LOCATION	; she is now at work on
Dostoieffsky	ORGANIZATION	, offering us the first version in easy , idiomatic English that we have seen .

		Four volumes have appeared ; others are promised , and we hope that she will not weary of her task until she has enabled us to enjoy a complete view of this disturbing and impressive figure , the most deeply Rus - sian of the Russians .

		Tourguenieff and Tol - stoi we accepted at once , finding little to quar - rel about in our critical estimates ; but with Dostoieffsky the case has been different .

		The interval between those who praise and those who depreciate is greater than with other writers ; nor is this the most puzzling aspect of the affair .

		We can not foresee the reaction of a given temperament .

		Thus , we hear
Nietzsche	PERSON	-LRB- obviously a little bewildered -RRB- con - fessing that the chief exemplar , - in our time , of his `` slave morality '' is the only man who can teach him psychology .

		Yet Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, who is a psychologist or nothing , finds `` Crime and Punishment '' so little to his mind that he can not finish it .

		If we turn to Amer - ica , we hear Professor
Phelps	PERSON	asserting that `` of all masters of fiction , both in
Russia	LOCATION	and elsewhere , he is the most truly spiritual . ' '

		On the other hand , Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	plunges us at once into the abyss by simply recording the impression he carried away from `` Crime and Punishment . ' ' ''

		Filth , disease , morbid dreams , bestiality , in - sanity , sodden crime , these are the natural pathway to the emancipation of the spirit ; these in some mysterious way are spirituality .

		And the same les - son runs through
Tolstoi	PERSON	and
Strindberg	LOCATION	and a dozen other moralists who are , as it were , the Prophets of our young . ''

		Mr.
More	PERSON	not only brackets
Tolstoi	LOCATION	with
Strindberg	LOCATION	but throws in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	also , by way of good measure .

		His looseness gives us a clue .

		This , we see , is no mere aesthetic protest ; it is a moral judg - ment , delivered with all the heat our Amer - ican critics so often reserve for purely moral judgments .

		It may occur to us that this is only the story of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	over again .

		Not in the least , since Dostoieffsky is orthodoxy itself , so thoroughly in the tradition that
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	places him beside
Pascal	PERSON	, `` the only logical Christian . ' '

		And if we turn to a
Continental	ORGANIZATION	critic like
Herr Otto Julius Bierbaum	PERSON	, we find him in an entirely different quandary .

		How is it possible , he asks , for us modern men to read this `` primitive Christian '' with sympa - thy ?

		What ideal does he offer us ?

		Passion - ate humility ; utter renunciation of the self ; the Christian virtues , in short !

		But we west - ern peoples have travelled by a very different road .

		We have achieved our destiny by an active , not to say ruthless , assertion of the will ; and this seems to us necessary and even right .

		We must admit that
Dostoieffsky	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy is deeply antipathetic .

		Only an art comparable to that of the Greeks and of Shakespeare can induce us to read him .

		The paradox involved in this vehement con - flict of opinion is not , after all , very difficult to resolve .

		We do not need to chatter of art for art 's sake .

		As it happens , the group to which Dostoieffsky belonged never claimed the least license on the ground that they were artists .

		They only approached the moral prob - lem in the peculiar Russian way , which is vastly different from ours .

		It often occurs to us as we read the Russians that they would make uncommonly awkward dinner guests .

		They have not learned our caution , our conven - tional reserves .

		Their conversational taboo covers an amazingly small area .

		They are infinitely curious , and there is no question they will not put to themselves and to others .

		Nor do they see the least reason why the truth , once discovered , should be smuggled out of sight like a shameful thing .

		This stubborn integrity of the Russian soul strikes us at once in
Tolstoi	LOCATION	and in
Dostoi	LOCATION	- effsky .

		Tolstoi , in his old age , turns preacher .

		Very well , but
Tolstoi	LOCATION	the novelist remains to the end a vigorous truth-teller .

		He envisages every form of meanness , lust , cupidity , in - trigue , hypocrisy .

		His vision for these things is not less sure than
De Maupassant 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		His testimony , in other words , is not in the least invalidated by his peculiar notions of what constitutes a `` good man . ''

		In Dostoieffsky , too , we find this supreme disinterestedness of the artist , co-existing with a genuinely fanati - cal view of things .

		His sense of evil is pro- found ; it obsesses and tortures him ; he can not rest until he has sketched every detail of it into his macabre design .

		Yet it requires no power of divination to see how he loathes it .

		He is appalled and sickened , but he persists .

		Even a careless reader can see that he is not content to remain , like
Balzac	LOCATION	, the literary secretary of society Balzac into whose com - plex nature there was kneaded , along with transcendent genius , so much of the common
Paris	LOCATION	mud .

		We feel , as we read , how power - fully Balzac was seduced by wealth , luxury , worldly success , the glittering and empty show of things .

		Dostoieffsky is not under the dominion of such thoughts ; but his intuitive understanding of how they work upon and alter the minds of others is profound and even THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	unique .

		Perhaps this is not wholly intuition , either .

		Knowledge may have come to him by more personal and direct ways , but with that we are not concerned .

		It is not easy to convey the peculiar quality of Dostoieff sky 's work , though it is easy enough to feel it .

		After read - ing a single novel , you say at once : Here is a writer who gives us something thrill ingly strange and new , a new kind of excitement of the nerves even for the effect of his work is not wholly psychic .

		He communicates to us the fever that so often tortures his characters , and something , too , of their uncanny sense of being on the verge of fresh and alarming spir - itual discoveries .

		An ambiguous look , a sig - nificant silence , a chance word these carry us at once out of our sunlit world into the crepuscular depths of his strange creations .

		Below the smooth surface , so familiar to our eyes , there lurk unguessed and awe-inspiring possibilities , as monsters lurk in the depths of the sea .

		For Dostoieffsky there are no commonplace souls ; nor for us either , while we read .

		His people are rarely sophisticated in our western sense ; they are often incoherent , wild , the victims of a fixed idea , unable in spite of their incredible volubility to explain themselves rationally .

		They live in their emotions with an intensity that seems strange to our intellec - tualized habit .

		If we learn from them , it is rather new ways of feeling than of thinking ; and that , at least , we do learn .

		The vulgar and brutal murderers Dostoieffsky meets in
Siberia	LOCATION	teach him .

		secrets , so that penologists listen to him with respect .

		Each convict is an individual in more than the statistical sense .

		Neither cunning nor swagger deceives him .

		The real man , he knows , lurks uneasily below and is something quite different from the morose mask he wears .

		Well , it is for this real man that he lies in wait .

		The composite pic - ture of the criminal appears , in some sort , in ' ' Crime and Punishment . ' '

		In its machinery , this is but a sensational police novel .

		Many persons , we are told , can see in it nothing more .

		Raskolnikov , the youthful murderer of two old women , carries on his endless duel of wits with the police .

		For some , possibly , the interest lies solely in the external problem .

		Will Raskolnikov suc - ceed in extricating himself ?

		Will he ulti - mately be caught in the cunning web that the police magistrate -LRB- surely a great figure of his kind -RRB- has spun ?

		One ventures to say that , for those who know how to read , the drama of `` Crime and Punishment '' is an inner drama wholly , a drama of almost unendurable in - tensity .

		Easkolnikov exhibits to the full the singular insensibility which Dostoieffsky ob - served in the murderers of
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		He is as unlike
Bill Sikes	PERSON	as possible ; he knows no remorse .

		But always there is the consuming fear of detection , the terror of the law .

		And above and beyond that , there is the fear of his own inadequacy to meet the test of character he has imposed ; for his crime is , in a way , an experiment he is conducting on himself .

		He can continue to believe in himself only so long as he finds the courage and the skill to defy society .

		His pride fails ; his life crumbles about him , and he is obliged to reconstruct it on another plane .

		Siberia is thus but an epi - sode in the tale of his regeneration .

		If we turn from `` Crime and Punishment '' to ' ' The
Brothers Karamazov	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' we find a book at once more formidable and more truly typi - cal .

		Dostoieffsky here makes no concessions to our laziness .

		It exhibits all his character - istic faults , of which we hear so much , on a gigantic scale .

		It is appallingly prolix , and contains material -LRB- some of it superb -RRB- that is wholly extraneous .

		It exposes to our view such an inferno of vice , squalor , bestiality , and disease as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	never imagined .

		The
Kara	PERSON	- mazovs are a group of a father and three sons .

		The father and the eldest son are deeply marked with the characteristic Karamazov taint : sensuality has reached in them almost the pitch of insanity .

		The book opens on the struggle of these two to possess a prostitute ; murder is clearly in the air and is presently realized .

		The second son is at once subtler and more sophisticated than most of Dostoieffsky 's people , but he , too , is evil .

		Only the youngest has escaped the Karamazov taint , and he , with the `` Idiot '' of another novel , serves to give us his creator 's idea of a `` good man . ''

		The method is that of drama ; there is no description of motive , no explanation .

		Dostoi - effsky simply unrolls before us in a succession of superb scenes the epic conflict in this tragic family .

		After a few chapters , we fancy we know his people ; but this is an illusion fos - tered by the shallow judgments we allow our - selves .

		Dostoieffsky has a profounder sense of spiritual values .

		Little by little , these wretches reveal themselves , turning out under our eyes the last secret folds in their depraved souls .

		They are appalling , and yet they are not that alone .

		They must know the truth about themselves , for they are tortured both by what they already know and by what they only suspect .

		The candor with which they confess the worst , has about it , after all , some - thing not ignoble .

		The eldest brother calls himself an `` insect , '' one of the noxious crea - tures cursed by God with the very delirium of desire .

		He rails at himself endlessly ; his self - contempt is boundless ; he exists in a perpetual
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , hell .

		Is it possible that he is at bottom a hypocrite , shielding himself from the bitter - ness of ultimate self-knowledge ?

		And the fierceness with which the second son lays hold of his conscience is a revelation in subtlety , for
Dostoieffsky	ORGANIZATION	brings to bear on the problem of moral casuistry an intellectual energy that tries the brain like dialectics .

		It has been urged that in all this we hear not the talk of average men , but the inexorable whisperings of the accusing conscience .

		And there are those w r ho complain that this is not realism .

		But if realism is to concern itself with surfaces only , how can it minister in any satisfying way to our curiosity ?

		Surely the easiest way for it to become false and mislead - ing , is to restrict its play too narrowly .

		At all events , Dostoieffsky has justified , for some of us , both his method and his material .

		The world he reveals to us may be peopled with creatures mean , diseased , abnormal , drunken , the prey of every evil passion and perversity it does not matter .

		We feel , as we read , that they are proper subjects for tragedy , and even for the greatest tragedy .

		One comes from this great Russian writer with an uneasy realization of the superficiality of our average judgments , the thinness of our spiritual experiences .

		He increases our sense of wonder and our capacity for awe .

		And he adds immeasurably to our understanding of the pathetic dignity of the downtrodden and oppressed .

		He has found for their dumbness a voice , poignant in its brooding sorrow and lovely in its rich compassion .

		He touches both the heights and the depths , remaining indif - ferent only to that middle ground on which most of us choose , for our comfort , to live out lives .

		GEORGE
BERNARD DONLIN	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A VOLTAIREAN VIEW OF WAR may be of in - terest at this time .

		Some one has called atten - tion to the illuminating discourse between Micromegas , gigantic dweller on one of the planets revolving about
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	, and a company of our philosophers , as reported in the seventh chapter of the amusing fantasy bearing the name of the above-mentioned Sirian visitor .

		A free translation of a part of this conversa - tion is here offered .

		After congratulating his terrestrial hearers on being so small and add - ing that , with so manifest a subordination of matter to mind , they must pass their lives in the pleasures of intellectual pursuits and mutual love a veritable spiritual existence the stranger is thus answered by one of the philosophers : `` We have more matter than we need for the accomplishment of much evil , if evil comes from matter , and more mind than we need if evil comes from mind .

		Do you know that at the present moment there are a hundred thousand fools of our species , wear - ing caps , who are killing a hundred thousand other animals wearing turbans , or who are themselves being massacred by the latter , and that almost everywhere on earth this is the immemorial usage ? ''

		The Sirian , properly shocked , demands the reason of these horrible encounters between creatures so puny .

		`` It is all about a pile of dirt no bigger than your heel , '' is the reply .

		`` Not that any one of these millions of men marching to slaughter has the slightest claim to this pile of dirt ; the only question is whether it shall belong to a certain man known as Sultan or to another having the title of Czar .

		Neither of the two has ever seen or ever will see the patch of ground in dispute , and hardly a single one of these animals engaged in killing one another has ever seen the animal for whom they are thus employed . ''

		Again the stranger ex - presses his horror , and declares he has half a mind to annihilate with a kick or two the whole batch of ridiculous assassins .

		`` Do n't give yourself the trouble , '' is the rejoinder ; `` they will accomplish their own destruction fast enough .

		Know that ten years hence not a hundredth part of these miserable wretches will be left alive ; and know , too , that even if they were not to draw the sword , hunger , exhaustion , or intemperance would make an end of most of them .

		Besides , they are not the ones to punish , but rather those sedentary barbarians who , from the ease and security of their private apartments , and while their din - ner is digesting , order the massacre of a mil - lion men , and then solemnly return thanks to God for the achievement . ''

		The visitor from
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	is moved with pity for a race of beings presenting such astonishing contrasts .

		THE QUALITY OF NATURALNESS IN STYLE is something that defies analysis .

		Let one writer express himself with a certain degree of what may be called elegance , and the artificiality of it is at once apparent , whereas the same measure of rhetorical finish and ornament in another writer will seem entirely natural .

		The first writer calls up the image of a per - son dressed in his seldom-used and carefully brushed best clothes ; the second represents the man who is habitually well-dressed and always at ease in his perfectly fitting raiment .

		Just what it is that constitutes the ' '
Sunday	DATE	- go-to-meeting '' character of the one suit of clothes , and the every-day-in-the-week look of the other , even though both be equally correct and stylish , it is impossible to say .

		Probably THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	there is something in the manner of wearing the clothes that makes the difference .

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	makes use of this sartorial simile in closing his interesting `` Remarks on American and English Fiction '' in the
December	DATE	`` At - lantic Monthly . ' '

		He says : ' ' Another simile that obtrudes itself in reading many Ameri - can novels is that of a visit from kindly folk who have come to a gathering in
Sunday	DATE	clothes and with
Sunday	DATE	manners .

		The peo - ple 's week-day spontaneity is replaced by a cautious preoccupation with their deport - ment , as to how they are expected to behave , and everything that they say is a little forced .

		Even in the admirable novels of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	and
Anne Douglas Sedgwick	PERSON	the conflict so often depicted between the idealism of the characters and their ordinary earthly motives gives one an odd feeling that both their morals and their manners are like tightly cut clothes in which people can not be quite at ease . ''

		Whether or not this is harsh criticism , it is enforced by an almost ludicrously apt quota - tion from one of our leading novelists .

		A VERSATILE NONOGENARiAN , remarkable for the range and variety of his scholarly tastes and literary accomplishments , died recently at
Pittsfield	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The Rev. Dr.
Addi	PERSON	- son
Ballard	PERSON	, who was born at
Framingham	LOCATION
ninety-two years ago last October	DATE	, held from first to last so many professorships in so many colleges and universities , east and west , that a list of them would only be a bewilderment to the reader .

		Suffice it to say that at
Wil	LOCATION	- liams College , where he took his bachelor 's degree at the age of twenty , he taught rhetoric in his early life , and at the
New York Uni	LOCATION	- versity he held the chair of logic in the last years of his teaching , from
1893	DATE	to
1904	DATE	, with professorships of mathematics , astronomy , Latin and Greek , moral philosophy , and other branches scattered in between .

		His long course of teaching furnished him with mate - rial for a book entitled `` Arrows , or Teaching a Fine Art . ''

		and his experience as pastor of churches in his native state and
Michigan	LOCATION	qualified him to write `` From Talk to Text '' and `` From Text to Talk , '' also `` Through the Sieve , '' and other contributions to serious lit - erature of a reflective or moral tone .

		A val - iant pedestrian , he accomplished the feat of climbing
Monument Mountain	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which in - spired
Bryant	PERSON	's poem of that name -RRB- in his eighty-ninth year , and up to the very end he set a pace in the streets of
Pittsfield	LOCATION	that many a younger man might have found it difficult to equal .

		One likes to hear of his daily walks and his daily practice of memorizing some classical phrase or some bit of verse .

		Daily , too , he made it a point to write something , not necessarily for publication , we infer , but rather to keep his pen from rusting .

		For the last eight years he had lived with his son , Mr.

		AN ARTIST FOR ART 'S SAKE is revealed , unex - pectedly to some , in the banker , philanthro - pist , and veteran of our Civil War , Major
Henry Lee Higginson	PERSON	, as briefly portrayed in Mr.
M. A. DeWolfe Howe	PERSON	's history of `` The
Boston	LOCATION	Symphony Orchestra . ''

		In his early twenties this octogenarian lover of music and generous provider of the best in that art for his city wrote to his father from
Vienna	LOCATION	, after referring to the possibility of adopting music - teaching as a calling : `` But the pleasure , pure and free from all disagreeable conse - quences or afterthoughts , of playing and still more of singing myself , is indescribable .

		In
Rome	LOCATION	I took about eight lessons of a capital master , and I used to enjoy intensely the singing to his accompaniment my exercises and some little Neapolitan songs .

		My rea - sons for studying harmony are manifest .

		I can not properly understand music without doing so ; moreover , it is an excellent exercise for the mind .

		As to writing music , I have nothing to say ; but it is not my expectation .

		It is like writing poetry ; if one is prompted to do so , and has anything to say , he does it .

		But I entirely disavow any such intention or aim in my present endeavor , and this I wish to be most clearly expressed and understood , should any one ask about me .

		/ am studying for my own good and pleasure .

		... It is only carrying out your own darling idea of making an imperishable capital in education .

		My money may fly away ; my knowledge can not .

		One belongs to the world , the other to me . ''

		The accident , a bodily injury grievous for the - young man to bear , which later led to Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	's devoting himself to business rather than to music , adds a pathetic interest to the too-brief biography forming the open - ing chapter of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's book .

William Hamilton	PERSON	as professor of logic and metaphysics in

University	ORGANIZATION	, and author of many books relating to his department of study , died a few weeks ago , rich in honors and full of years .


Alexander Campbell Fraser	PERSON	was born
September 3 , 1819	DATE	, and finished his education at the university where he was to help educate others for almost half a century .

Hamilton	LOCATION	, who had just died , from
1856	DATE	to
1891	DATE	; profes - sor emeritus after closing his active labors in the university ; and throughout his years of maturity he wrote philosophical essays , biogra - phies of noted philosophers , and other books of some note .

		His ' ' Life and Letters of
Berke	PERSON	- ley , '' published in
1871	DATE	, was his first consid - erable work , and he also wrote the life of
Thomas Reid	PERSON	, contributed the volumes on
Locke	PERSON	and
Berkeley	LOCATION	to the series of ``
Philo	PERSON	- sophical Classics , '' put forth a two-volume `` Philosophy of Theism , '' and at eighty-five gave to the w r orld his ``
Biographia Philo	PERSON	- sophica , a Personal Retrospect . ''

		His recrea - tions , says `` Who 's Who , '' were `` country life and visits to scenes of biographical or histori - cal interest . ' '

Lucerne	LOCATION	,
Zurich	LOCATION	, and

		The new courses will , it is expected , begin with the
winter quarter	DATE	, and in the
spring	DATE	there will probably be offered courses in Russian literature and his - tory .

		Books and periodicals relating to all these courses will be added to the library , and additional lecturers from
Russia	LOCATION	will be en - gaged .

		AN AUTHOR 'S PROTEST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a recent issue of THE DIAL , in a paragraph speaking of my book , '' The Greek Spirit , '' are many misrepresentations in point of fact .

		Four of the misrepresentations prompt me to send you the following : First : Your reviewer writes , '' We find an American thumb-print in the use of humans in the sense of men and women . ''

		Humans , '' in the sense of men and women , '' is an old English word .

		I have met it , I think , in a black-letter Holinshed printed in
London	LOCATION	in 1584-5 ; certainly in other old English books .

		The reason of the use of the word in old times and now is clear it has the advantage of connoting what no other word in our noble English speech explicitly connotes .

		If your reviewer will turn to the word in `` A New English Dictionary , '' edited by Sir
James Murray	PERSON	, he will find a quotation from
Lowell	LOCATION	to the effect that
George Chapman	PERSON	, contemporary of Shakespeare and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, habitually used '' humanes , '' in its common meaning , in his translation of Homer .

		Your reviewer will also find humans , '' in the sense of men and women , '' in writings of the Scottish 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan.	DATE	1
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and of Englishmen of our day .

		Second : Your reviewer also finds '' an unhy - phened , half-German locution in the ugly words their art gift . ''

		Most excellent publications in
England	LOCATION	as well as in this country have used such words as art , race , without hyphen , adjectively , these past fifty years ; centuries longer , if the phrase art magique is included .

		Art , has even come into such popular uses as '' art union , '' '' art squares . ''

		Third : '' Subjects and predicates do not gener - ally play hide-and-seek with the reader as in this : ' Cereals grew in sunlit tillage , the grape sacred through its use in the religions of many peoples , the gray-green olive , other esculent fruits , and horned cattle grazed in meadows dotted by bene - factive forest trees . ' ''

		Subject and predicate play no hide-and-seek in this quoted sentence .

		It is plain , legitimate , parsable by a schoolboy .

		Fourth : Your reviewer speaks of competition with others .

		My book strives with none .

		Its plan and its philosophy , its content determining dis - tinctive features of a race spirit and tracing the evolution of that race spirit from earliest begin - nings to the end , show that the book is different from what he terms my , or its , '' dangerous rivals . ''

		As to Professor
Basil Gildersleeve	PERSON	's beautiful ''
Hellas	PERSON	and
Hesperia	LOCATION	, '' your reviewer should re - call that , upon its publication , a paragraphing fellow of his pronounced upon it with all the fatuous impertinence of incompetents of his craft .

		MOMMSEN AND THE WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Much has been written of the influence of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, as adapted and popularized by Treit - schke , in creating the conditions out of which sprang the present war .

		While that influence undoubtedly has been great , it by no means marks the beginning of German aspirations to world hegemony .

		When the development of this motive shall have been traced , I venture to predict that
Mommsen	PERSON	's glorification of Roman imperialism will be found to have been an important factor .

		From many passages in his `` History of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' which might be quoted in illustration of this point , I select three , which may be found on pp. 3 , 6 , and 440 , respectively , in Vol .

		V. of the American edition of
1900	DATE	: '' By virtue of the law , that a people which has grown into a state absorbs its neighbors who are in political nonage , and a civilized people absorbs its neighbors who are in intellectual nonage by virtue of this law , which is as universally valid and as much a law of nature as the law of gravity the Italian nation -LRB- the only one in antiquity which was able to combine a superior political development and a supe - rior civilization ... -RRB- was entitled to reduce to sub - jection the Greek states of the
East	LOCATION	which were ripe for destruction , and to dispossess the peoples of lower grades of culture in the West ... '' `` There was a direct political necessity for
Rome	LOCATION	to meet the perpetually threatened invasion of the Germans ... beyond the Alps , and to construct a rampart there which should secure the peace of the Roman world .

		But even this important object was not the highest and ultimate reason for which
Gaul	ORGANIZATION	was conquered by
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the old home had become too narrow for the Roman burgesses and they were in danger of decay , the senate 's policy of Italian conquest saved them from ruin .

		Now the Italian home had become in its turn too narrow ; once more the state languished under the same social evils re - peating themselves in similar fashion upon a grander scale .

		It was a brilliant idea , a grand hope , which led
Caesar	PERSON	over the Alps the idea and the confident expectation that he should gain there for his fellow - burgesses a new boundless home , and regenerate the state a second time by placing it upon a broader basis . '' ''

		For
Rome	LOCATION	alone history not merely performed miracles , but also repeated its miracles , and twice cured the internal crisis , which in the state itself was incurable , by regenerating the state .

		There was doubtless much corruption in this regeneration ; as the union of
Italy	LOCATION	was accomplished over the ruins of the Samnite and Etruscan nations , so the
Mediterra	LOCATION	- nean monarchy built itself upon the ruins of count - less states and tribes once living and vigorous ; but it was a corruption out of which sprang a new growth ... What was pulled down for the sake of the new building , was merely the secondary nationali - ties which had long since been marked out for de - struction by the levelling hand of civilization . ''

		Much could be said in comment upon these ex - tracts but their application is sufficiently obvious .

		Repeatedly does
Mommsen	PERSON	assert the right of con - quest that belongs to the union of superior organi - zation in the state and superior '' kultur '' in the people .

		The relation of the war to the subjective desire to check the growth of social democracy I leave to the reader .

		Mommsen 's '' History '' was completed in
1857	DATE	.

		In his later life he deprecated the growth of militarism , but the harvest was the legitimate fruit of the seed that he had himself sown .

		At - the annual meeting of the
American Society of International Law	ORGANIZATION
last April	DATE	, Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	quoted the first of the passages given above and christened its content ''
Mommsen	PERSON	's law . ''

		He remarked that it mas - queraded under various aliases , such as '' manifest destiny '' and `` benevolent assimilation , '' and he might have added '' peaceful penetration '' and '' international right of eminent domain . ''

		As
Viscount Bryce	PERSON	has recently said : '' The war is a struggle between ideals the ideal of a military state resolved to dominate all the neighboring countries and the ideal of peaceful communities dwelling in tranquillity under the protection of treaties . ''

		The fact that British interests are bound up in the triumph of the latter ideal does not alter the case .

		So are the interests of civilization .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL , 11 METRICAL , FREEDOM AND THE CONTEMPORARY POET .

		* Poets have grown either less bold or more courteous than they were in the days when the authors of '' The Dunciad '' or of `` English Bards and Scotch Reviewers '' blackened many a fellow - writer 's face with adroit mud .

		One need hardly bemoan the fact , since the admirable wit of those productions barely compensated for their execrable taste .

		But enthusiasm for even impersonal literary con - troversy seems lacking to-day ; and differ - ences of opinion so sharp that they might once have divided the poets into two hostile camps now scarcely serve to embroil them with their next-door neighbors .

		Only thus can one explain the fact that open warfare has not broken out between the pro- ponents of the lately resurrected theory of vers libre and the adherents of the orthodox type of regularly rhythmical metres .

		A genu - ine difference of opinion and of temperament is involved .

		On the one side stand the writers who demand complete freedom of rhythm as a requisite for expressing the free and irregular contours of emotion ; and on the other side stand those who regard metrical regularity as the sole instrument by which high emotion can be given successful expression .

		Mr.
Arthur Stringer	PERSON	, in the Foreword of his new volume , `` Open Water , '' states the first of these positions with some elaboration .

		The traditional technique of rhythm and rhyme is , he believes , as hampering and anachronistic as the chain-armour of the Middle Ages would be to a modern soldier ; the poet of to-day is unable to achieve natural expression under such a handicap .

		Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	points out very truly that the almost boundless liberty afforded by blank verse is not available to the poet except for large , almost epical , themes ; therefore , in actual practice , rhymed verse alone remains to him for `` the utterance of those more intimate moods and those subjec - tive experiences which may be described as characteristically modern . ''

		But rhymed verse forces him to `` sacrifice content for form , '' and has `` left him incapable of what may be called abandonment . ' '

		Even regular - ity of rhythm , where no rhyme is present , `` crowds his soul into a geometrically designed mould . ''

New York	LOCATION	:

		BEYOND THE BREAKERS .

		By
George Sterling	PERSON	.

		San Fran - cisco :
A. M. Robertson	PERSON	.

		The objection to Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	's plausible theory lies in his own admission that formal rhythm and rhyme supply `` definiteness of outline '' and `` give design to the lyric . ''

		Without the agency of a fixed rhythm , it is almost impossible to achieve those recurrences , pulses , waves , and echoes whose function in poetry is no adventitious or superfluous one .

		A fixed cadence alone can serve as a base for all the musical variations that the poet may wish to employ ; and his success here is vital .

		Deprive `` Lycidas '' of its antiphonal organ - roll of sound , its great succession of mounded harmonies , and it would be nothing .

		The design is the poem .

		The metrical form is the very condition , the true means , of the poet 's success .

		That spontaneous expression of emo - tion for which Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	pleads is not likely to result in poetry at all ; what turns raw feeling into poetry is precisely the com - pression of the material into an artful pat - tern , an expressive structure , an intelligible design .

		Not sobs , but music whose tone has sobs buried in it , not laughter , but the song that dances with winged feet , come within the categories of art .

		In the process of turn - ing emotion into art , some loss has to be suf - fered ; but the loss is not so large as Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	would have us believe .

		To sacrifice content for form , as he tells us we now do , would indeed be lamentable ; but on the other hand , to sacrifice form for content means sim - ply to break the bottle that might have held at least a part of the wine .

		The competent craftsman does not , however , have to choose between these evils .

		Form is his opportunity , not his prison , as some of Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	's own earlier lyrics prove .

		Most writers would agree that the exigencies of rhyme suggest felicitous excursions of thought far more fre - quently than they inhibit the exact statement of an idea in all its original integrity .

		The practiced poet learns not to formulate his idea too rigidly in advance , but to let it develop and grow like an unfolding vine over and through the lattice of his metrical trellis .

		After all , the sole criterion by which any artistic theory can be judged is its success in practice .

		Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	's practice of vers libre is not a convincing exemplification of the vir - tue of his theory .

		One of the best , and also one of the most regular , of his poems is the following , entitled `` The Wild Swans Pass '' : '' In the dead of night You turned in your troubled sleep As you heard the wild swans pass ; And then you slept again . ''

		You slept While a new world swam beneath That army of eager wings , 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	While plainland and slough and lake Lay wide to those outstretched throats , While the lone far Lights allured That phalanx of passionate breasts . ''

		And I who had loved you more Than a homing bird loves flight , 1 watched with an ache for freedom , I rose with a need for life , Knowing that love had passed Into its unknown North ! ''

		It is hard not to feel that even this finely con - ceived picture needs the melody of a more defi - nitely patterned form , that we shall forget this nebulous strain to-morrow , but that if it had been woven through the rhythm of a true music , however hesitant its beat , we could never forget it .

		Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, also , has provided her volume , `` Sword Blades and Poppy Seed , '' with a Preface in which she raises the question of metrics .

		`` Unrhymed cadence , '' as she prefers to call vers libre , differs from the rhythms of ordinary prose `` by being more curved , and containing more stress . ''

		This statement justly suggests that it is to prose and not to regularly rhythmical verse that we must look for the prototype of vers libre .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	has used `` unrhymed cadence '' for many , but not all , of her poems ; and she ex - pressly disclaims being an exclusive partisan of either form .

		Technique of versification is only one of many techniques that interest her .

		Her most notable quality appears in the open - ing passage of the volume . ''

		A drifting ,
April	DATE	, twilight sky , A wind that blew the puddles dry , And slapped the river into waves That ran and hid among the staves Of an old wharf .

		A watery light Touched bleak the granite bridge , and white Without the slightest tinge of gold , The city shivered in the cold .

		All day my thoughts had lain as dead , Unborn and bursting in my head .

		From time to time I wrote a word With lines and circles overscored .

		My table seemed a graveyard , full Of coffins waiting burial ... '' The sharply etched tones and contours of this picture are characteristic of the author 's work .

		Sometimes , however , an extreme carelessness , very different from that painstaking care which she praises in the `` clear-eyed French - men , '' mars her verse .

		`` Were '' does not re - spectably rhyme with `` where , '' nor `` vault '' with `` tumult , '' nor `` Max '' with `` climax , '' nor `` time '' with `` thyme '' ; yet this entire group of deformities occurs within the space of nineteen consecutive lines .

		This is no mere breaking of technical rules ; it is the destruc - tion of beauty .

		If the requirements of rhyme so irk a writer , it would be better to follow Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	's example and use vers libre only .

		In ' ' unrhymed cadence , ' ' Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's cadences are sometimes extremely delicate , as in `` The Captured Goddess '' : '' Over the housetops , Above the rotating chimney-pots , I have seen a shiver of amethyst , And blue and cinnamon have flickered A moment At the far end of a dusty street . ''

		Through sheeted rain Has come a lustre of crimson , And I have watched moonbeams Hushed by a film of palest green . ''

		It was her wings , Goddess !

		Who stepped over the clouds , And laid her rainbow feathers Aslant on the currents of the air ... '' But to some readers , this passage will be merely an added proof of the fact that good vers libre is absolutely not so expressive as good rhythmical verse .

		Several passages on a similar theme in
Shelley	LOCATION	's `` Prometheus Un - bound '' confirm such an opinion ; nor is the comparison an unfair one , since every writer must endure the rivalry of the whole body of his predecessors .

		`` Unrhymed cadence '' at its best can hardly convey that intensity of effect which is poetry 's peculiar function ; certain clear emotional heights are as impossible of attainment by it as by prose .

		Not so pliant , not so accurate , not even so free a medium for expression as the old rhythms !

		To say a thing directly , to cry it out , is not necessarily to express it .

		The complexities of rhythm and rhyme are not always a hindrance to the expression of com - plex thoughts .

		The poet 's need is sometimes best served by that great world of musical signals and emotional calls which is at the disposal of him who accepts the convention that governs rhythmical verse , and employs this very convention as the instrument for evoking emotions that could never be evoked by naturalistic means .

		The supreme element of poetry comes into being only with that peculiar lift and flight which the disembodied imagination can take on the wings of formal geometrical beauty .

		Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	, in her newly collected volume , `` You and I , '' experiments with vers libre ; but the pieces written in this style are few in number .

		Modernity in other than metrical matters chiefly marks her ambitions .

		In many of her poems she attempts with seriousness and devotion to consecrate poetry to the task of expressing modern industrial life .

		`` The Hotel , '' `` Night in State Street , ''
1915	DATE	-RSB- 13 ' ' The Turbine ' ' are the titles of the first three poems in the book ; and their names indicate something of the author 's aim .

		It is not wholly demonstrable that so specifically pur - posed an interest in the concrete and not always significant aspects of modernity is the best way of attaining this end .

		There is in such an effort too much of the conscious intel - ligence and too little of those blind tides of passionate understanding which alone pour greatness into poetry .

		Yet these are rather well-known poems , which have given pleasure to many `` people of high degree '' ; and it is perhaps a work of supererogation , or worse , of arrogance , to criticize unfavorably cer - tain conceptions that find place in them .

		The critic must , however , unsociably go his own chosen way , lighted by his own lantern .

		In some instances he may find himself unable to follow Miss
Monroe	PERSON	.

		To view the turbine , its purring revolutions , its hidden lightnings , its moods and rebellions , as a proud tempes - tuous woman , seems an example of that kind of poetic imagination which does not interpret but rather encumbers the true essence of its theme .

		In the poem `` Our Canal , '' also , the lines ''
Panama	LOCATION	, ribbon twist That ties the continents together . ''

		are surely a bad , a false , a really unimagina - tive way of seeing the world of things as they are .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's best work is not in this vein .

		Here she seems like a
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	led by an infelicitous chance into an alien and un - mastered world of modern mechanics , where her very genuine powers are largely useless .

		Her best accomplishment is in the vein of less ambassadorial utterance , in personal poems where she subdues a smaller world more per - fectly to the service of poetry .

		Take the fol - lowing sonnet : '' Look on the dead .

		Stately and pure he lies Under the white sheet 's marble folds .

		For him The solemn bier , the scented chamber dim , The sacred hush , the bowed heads of the wise , The slow pomp , the majestical disguise Of haughty death , the conjurer even for him , Poor trivial one , pale shadow on the rim , Whom life marked not , but death may not despise .

		Now is he level with the great ; no king Enthroned and crowned more royal is , more sure Of the world 's reverence .

		Yesterday this thing Was but a man , mortal and insecure ; Now chance and change their homage to him bring And he is one with all things that endure . ''

		This dignified passage , written probably some time ago , may serve to remind the reader once more of the value of the very old and , as Miss
Monroe	PERSON	herself now believes , `` exhausted '' sonnet form .

		In `` The Wonder of It '' also ,
Miss Monroe	PERSON	has no difficulty in aptly turning conventional rhyme and rhythm to her own fantastic and original uses : '' How wild , how witch-like weird that life should be !

		That the insensate rock dared dream of me , And take to bursting out and burgeoning Oh , long ago yo ho !

		And wearing green !

		How stark and strange a thing That life should be ! ''

		Oh , mystic mad , a rigadoon of glee , That dust should rise , and leap alive , and flee Afoot , awing , and shake the deep with cries Oh , far away yo hay !

		What moony masque , what arrogant disguise That life should be ! ''

		Mr.
George Sterling	PERSON	, an experienced metrist , trained in the great lyric tradition of the past , is wholly faithful to rhythmical verse in his new volume `` Beyond the Breakers . ''

		All the freedom that he needs he takes for hims_elf within the compass of regular rhythms .

		How little cramped he is , a passage from his `` Browning Centenary Ode '' may attest : '' vision wide and keen !

		Which knew , untaught , that pains to joyance are As night unto the star That on the effacing dawn must burn unseen .

		And thou didst know what meat Was torn to give us milk , What countless worms made possible the silk That robes the mind , what plan Drew as a bubble from old infamies And fen-pools of the past The shy and many-colored soul of man .

		Yea !

		thou hast seen the lees In that rich cup we lift against the day , Seen the man-child at his disastrous play His shafts without a mark , His fountains flowing downward to the dark , His maiming and his bars , Then turned to see His vatic shadow cast athwart the stars , And his strange challenge to infinity ... '' It is interesting to speculate as to how the devotee of vers libre would have gone about ' attaining this lift and soar of flight .

		It may be doubted if he could possibly do so except by falling back upon that fairly regular variety of free metre which
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	sometimes employed .

		To achieve that peculiar thing which we call poetry , a sus - taining , emotion-heightening recurrence of rhythm is as indispensable as music is to opera .

		The sole debatable question is , how regular must the recurrence be to produce the desired trance-like effect ?

		Vers libre often comes perilously near to the less insistent rhythms of prose , and loses the characteristic power of poetry thereby .

		* In 1834
George Bancroft	PERSON	published the first volume of his ' ' History of the Colonization of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' which was followed eigh - teen years later by a '' History of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion in
North America	LOCATION	. ' '

		For a long time the spirit of
George Bancroft	PERSON	animated the writing of American history , and even after two gener - ations the influence of his early pioneer work is still to be reckoned with .

		Bancroft came well prepared to his work and while in the diplomatic service had unusual opportunities to collect materials for the continuation of his great undertaking ; but in
the first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, when the memories of two wars with
England	LOCATION	were still fresh in the popular mind , it was scarcely possible to view the events of the later colonial period in their true light .

		In recent years the researches of Professor
Osgood	PERSON	, Mr.
G. L. Beer	PERSON	, and others have in a large measure discredited the con - clusions that
Bancroft	LOCATION	stated with such patri - otic fervor : it has come to be seen that there were deeper causes than the quarrel over taxa - tion for the separation from
England	LOCATION	, and that it was probably the complexities of the imperial problem rather than mean-spirited politics that led the English government to take the unfortunate course of action that it followed in
1765	DATE	and the succeeding years .

		It is therefore strange to find
Bancroft	LOCATION	's discredited viewpoint taken by a most re - spectable historian from across the seas .

		About a dozen years ago Sir
George Otto Trevelyan	PERSON	began to write a history of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, of which the sixth and last volume has just been published .

		For no very good reason , it seems , the last two vol - umes have been called ''
George III	PERSON	.

		and
Charles James Fox	PERSON	. ''


George III	PERSON	.

		is no more prominent in these than in the earlier ones and the same may be said of
Charles Fox	ORGANIZATION	.

		It ' is true , however , that Sir
George	PERSON	regards the English phase of the conflict as a struggle be - tween the opposing political systems that these two stood for ; and in tracing this con - flict the author does not attempt to conceal the fact that his sympathies are wholly on the side of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	and the Whigs .

		Whatever the merits ` of the American Revolutionary movement , and Sir
George	PERSON	believes in the essential justice of the American cause , the Revolution , and espe - cially its outcome , had great importance for the history of constitutional government by rendering impossible the plans of

		* GEORGE THE THIRD AND
CHARLES JAMES Fox	PERSON	.

		Being the Concluding Part of '' The American Revolution . ''

George Otto Trevelyan	PERSON	,
Bart	LOCATION	.

		In two vol - umes .

		Volume II .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cause of English liberty was victorious on American battle-fields .

		A work of this type would naturally meet with much criticism from both English and American reviewers .

		American reviewers have insisted that the work is really a history of
England	LOCATION	during the period of the American war ; and that on the American side it shows little originality , being chiefly a compilation from older American sources .

		These critics feel that the author has not attempted to fathom the deeper problems of our history during and immediately before the Revolu - tion .

		English reviewers , on the other hand , have insisted that , while the American patriots may have had the right on their side , they were not so virtuous -LRB- nor the English states - men so villainous -RRB- as Sir
George	PERSON	would have us believe .

		It has also been charged that his statements are not always accurate and that his emphasis is often misplaced .

		There is some truth in the charge that the author does not always distinguish nicely between impor - tant and unimportant matters : in his last volume , for instance , he describes in great detail two duels , one between
Fox	ORGANIZATION	and
Adam	PERSON	and the other between
Shelburne	LOCATION	and
Fullar	PERSON	- ton , `` affairs `` which may have furnished in - teresting gossip at the time but seem to have had no appreciable influence on the course of English history .

		It seems quite evident that the author feels that in these fearful days of
1914	DATE	there will be those who will feel that his work and par - ticularly the last volume , containing , as it does , much bitter criticism of the administra - tion of the
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	regime , is wanting in patriotic spirit .

		In an inserted `` address to the reader '' -LRB- clearly an after - thought -RRB- Sir
George	PERSON	informs us that the volume `` was already in print some weeks before the out - break of the German war '' and that there is ' ' no allusion whatever to passing events . ' '

		He also assures us that `` there is nothing in the book which the author desires to correct or alter ; and the subject-matter is not inappro - priate to the soul-stirring period in which we are living . ''

		Continuing he says , '' The story of the manly and chivalrous spirit in which , four generations ago , the two great English - speaking nations fought out , and ended , their famous quarrel is a story that an Englishman need have no scruple about telling even at a moment when his country , with a steadfast and grounded belief in the justice of her cause , is in the throes of war . ''

		In this connection one is tempted to quote from his characterization of Frederick II .

		of
Prussia	LOCATION	, some of the sentences of which might also be used in giving expression to the aver -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 age Englishman 's view of the present German Kaiser .

		The author believes that Americans generally have an unwarranted opinion of the services that the great
Frederick	PERSON	rendered to the Revolutionary cause . ''

		The gratitude of Americans toward
Frederick	PERSON	the Great was cheaply earned , and has lasted to this very hour .

		He ran no risks , and made no sacrifices , for their cause , and he was apt to forget their very existence as soon as they had ceased to serve his purpose ; and yet room has been found for his statue at
Washington	LOCATION	, while tlie unfortunate King of
France	LOCATION	, who went to war for
America	LOCATION	with con - sequences which ultimately were fatal to his own life , and his own dynasty , has no monument erected to his memory in any American town or city . ''

		In his estimates of American generals and statesmen Sir
George	PERSON	is as a rule very favor - able , sometimes using stronger terms than an American writer would care to use .

		In a casual reference to General
Philip Sheridan	PERSON	he speaks of him as `` the greatest captain of mounted infantry that the world has seen . ''

		He is much impressed with the strength and abilities of the
Adams	PERSON	family : '' For there is perhaps no other instance on record of a family which , over the space of a century and a half , has produced , in direct descent from father to son , four generations of men of such strong and sterling character , such remarkable and recognized talents , and such vigorous longevity . ''

		We are reminded of recent events when the author tells us that
John Adams	PERSON	`` scrupulously returned the visits made to
Passy	ORGANIZATION	by American gentlemen resident in
Paris	LOCATION	, who had already begun to complain , as American gentlemen have complained ever since , that they did not re - ceive due attention from the diplomatic representa - tives of their country in a foreign capital . ''

		His estimate of the military abilities of Gen - eral
Greene	PERSON	is probably somewhat lower than that of some American historians : ``
Nathan	PERSON	- iel
Greene	PERSON	was not a general of the first order but he had mastered the practice and had sedulously and clearly thought out the princi - ples of war . ' '

		The volume covers in a general way the
last two years	DATE	of the war , beginning with a dis - cussion of the state of English opinion after it was understood that the European powers were preparing to fight
England	LOCATION	and closing with the downfall of the
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	ministry a few months after the surrender of Corn - wallis at
Yorktown	LOCATION	.

		On the American side the work gives fairly satisfactory accounts of the activities of the American diplomats abroad , of the war in the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, and of the siege of
Yorktown	LOCATION	.

		The bulk of the volume , however , is devoted to English affairs : the Irish volunteer movement , the menace of the
League of Neutrals	ORGANIZATION	, the parliamentary situa - tion , the county associations , the
Gordon	PERSON	riots , and the movement for economical reform are some of the larger topics that the author has discussed .

		While Sir
George	PERSON	can scarcely find terms strong enough to express his condemna - tion of the ministry , especially
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	,
Lord Sandwich	PERSON	, and Lord
George Germaine	PERSON	, the last two having charge of the admiralty and the war office respectively , he is very chari - table in his treatment of the British generals .


Howe	PERSON	,
Clinton	PERSON	,
Cornwallis	LOCATION	,
Carleton	PERSON	,
Rawdon	PERSON	, were all excellent soldiers ; their failure to conquer the Continentals the author attributes chiefly to the blunders of the English war office , from which they received iron-clad and impossible instructions .


Howe	PERSON	and
Clinton	PERSON	also lost ground through their failure to ap - preciate the value of civil government in the conquered or loyal sections ; the military gov - ernment that they did provide Sir
George	PERSON	finds to have been unspeakably corrupt .

		Of General
Burgoyne	PERSON	he has this to say : '' Seldom , except indeed in the legend of
Belisarius	LOCATION	, was a general worse used by his official superiors than
John Burgoyne	PERSON	.

		Acting under iron-bound in - structions , with a far less than sufficient force of troops , he had displayed on several occasions the professional skill of a veteran commander , and on every occasion the heroic courage of a perfect soldier . ''

		Aside from his estimate of men and meas - ures Sir
George	PERSON	has contributed little that is new or original .

		Whether his opinions will find a very wide acceptance is a matter of great doubt .

		All historians are willing to grant that the government of
England	LOCATION	during the first two decades of the reign of
George III	ORGANIZATION	.

		was most of the time as corrupt and inefficient as Sir
George	PERSON	asserts it to have been ; but the causes of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	probably lay in
America	LOCATION	rather than in
Westminster	LOCATION	: the forces that work for nationality were at work in the western world , and
America	LOCATION	could not be expected to continue much longer as the willing subject of a distant government .

		But whether the author 's conclusions be ac - cepted or rejected , all will admit that he has produced a work of singular charm ; our only regret is that his style and his art have enshrined a mistaken view of American his -

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	down to the present time .

		Nor are signs alto - gether wanting that the appearance of the desired book is near at hand .

		Good models are to be had in works of the right proportion on other literatures both ancient and modern .

		One thinks of the `` Abridged History of Greek Literature '' by
Alfred	PERSON	and
Maurice Croiset	PERSON	, with its relation to their larger French work in five volumes , this latter being perhaps the best history of any literature in any language .

		Or one thinks of Mr.
J. Wright Duff	PERSON	's most admirable `` Literary History of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' mar - vellous for its fulness , accuracy , and conden - sation , and for a grace and interest that never fail ; or of Lanson 's ' ' History of French Lit - erature , '' which merits a similar description .

		Indeed , we may recall the noble work of
Ten Brink	ORGANIZATION	on English literature itself , regretting that no one has seen fit to revise the transla - tion , and to complete the whole , in English , in the light of our present knowledge in which case the demand for an ideal book would be satisfied .

		Wiilker 's volume -LRB- `` Geschichte der Englischen Litteratur von den Aeltesten Zeiten bis zur Gegenwart '' -RRB- , so far as I am aware , is the only work on the subject , by a recognized scholar with a technical training , that is intended to be popular , and at the same time follows the entire course of English literature from the beginnings down to
Tenny	PERSON	- son and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Wiilker was not an in - spired literary critic , as Ten Brink was ; his illustrations , and his estimable motives , hardly make up for the lack of attractiveness in his pages ; nevertheless in scope his book supplies a model .

		In addition to models , the trained linguist and literary student , who alone could produce the desired work , would have a few literary - histories of particular epochs to rest upon , among them the exceptionally good account of Middle English literature by Professor
Brandl	PERSON	in
Paul	LOCATION	's ' ' Grundriss '' ; and he would have at his command the `` Cambridge History of English Literature '' -LRB- with its bibliographies -RRB- , though the several parts of this must not be employed without discrimination .

		Nor should one forget Professor
Northup	PERSON	's forthcoming bibliography of bibliographies for the study of English , which will be indispensable to every scholar in this and related subjects .

		But the ideal historian of English literature will not possess every advantage enjoyed by Lanson ,
Duff	PERSON	, and the brothers Croiset : he will not find the wheat for his cake so thor - oughly ground and bolted as are the materials for a literary history of
France	LOCATION	or
Rome	LOCATION	or
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Much scholarly attention , it is true , has of late been devoted to the period , or periods , subsequent to the accession of
Eliza	LOCATION	- beth , which Ten Brink some twenty years ago felt unprepared to treat with precision , and so omitted from his plan .

		Yet from the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethans on , the historian will find many serious gaps in our knowledge , and more than one well-nigh incredible defect in the necessary apparatus .

		The prose of
Milton	LOCATION	, for example , has never been properly edited ; and there is no satisfactory edition of
Burke	PERSON	.

		Under these conditions , the historian must divine the hid - den course of events through the force of a trained sympathetic insight ; an insight into the nature and genius of the English language and literature as a whole ; an insight nour - ished in the best traditions of English scholar - ship , and rigorously disciplined in those parts of the subject for example , in Old English where the need of precision is most obvious , if not also most attainable .

		To those who know , it is obvious that the first requisite in the way of external acquirement for the historian of English literature is a thorough knowledge of Old and Middle English .

		Mr.
Mair	PERSON	's book , in spite of more than one excellence , is not of the sort we have in mind .

		It is the outgrowth of his handy little volume , ' ' English Literature : Modern , ' ' in the ' '
Home University Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' which followed a supe - rior work in the same series , `` English Lit - erature : Mediaeval , '' by Professor
Ker	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Mair	PERSON	's present work begins with
Chaucer	PERSON	, and the author undertakes to defend what is not defensible , the old notion that English litera - ture begins with `` The Canterbury Tales . ''

		He is at some pains not to be caught saying just that , but it is the idea he would like to convey .

		`` For the scholars , '' he remarks , `` our literature may begin earlier ; for the poets it began with him -LSB- Chaucer -RSB- . ''

		Is Mr.
Mair	PERSON	also among the poets ?

		And does he think that students of Old English have no feeling for literary and historical values ?

		Does he forget , too , that , among the poets ,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	showed some interest in the earliest stages of the language and literature , and were variously indebted to the study of it ?

		His general mistake , perhaps , lies in uncritically following Professor
Legouis	PERSON	, and in coming by ` himself to project Chaucer on a French and Italian background ; on this rather than on the entire background of mediaeval ideas , En - glish as well as
Continental	ORGANIZATION	, and in
Latin	LOCATION	as well as in the vernacular literatures .

		But in particular one can not agree with him when he says that , if we go no farther back in
England	LOCATION	than
Chaucer	PERSON	, `` we shall certainly lose nothing which affects what is to come afterwards . ''

		We should miss the Old En - glish `` Battle of Brunanburh , '' which seems to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 have affected
Tennyson	PERSON	, since he modernized it .

		And when Mr.
Mair	PERSON	says that Old English is as distinct from Modern as Modern English is from German , he must mean superficially as it were , to a schoolboy 's vision .

		Neither a scholar nor a poet who really knew and loved Old English would say so .

		We suspect Mr.
Mair	PERSON	's attainments in this part of the field from the time he alludes in his Preface to ' ' the philologist '' -LRB- meaning student of linguistics -RRB- and `` the professor of dead dialects '' ; and we therefore suspect his ability to judge after the fashion of Ten Brink whether the study of Chaucer is much or little dependent upon the study of Old and Middle English .

		Before proceeding to the praise which on some accounts we wish to accord to Mr.
Mair	PERSON	's volume , let us attend to a few other strictures .

		His plan , he says , '' aims at maintaining an individual point of view , at laying stress on ideas and tendencies rather than at recording facts and events , and it does not hesi - tate to draw generously on standard works of criti - cism and biography with which students are familiar . ''

		If in several cases the author derives his opinions from excellent studies , such as the work on Chaucer by Professor
Legouis	PERSON	, never - theless he can not be termed discriminating in the matter of authorities .

		Thue he is capable of naming as the `` two best critics '' of
Milton	PERSON	one who is good , but not best ,
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, and `` Professor ''
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, who is negligible .

		Where in his hierarchy would Mr.
Mair	PERSON	put Addison and Dr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	?

		And where would
Osgood	PERSON	,
Masson	PERSON	, and
Verity	ORGANIZATION	come in ?

		This lack of discrimination as to books is on a par with several other uncritical utterances .

		For example ,
Milton	PERSON	`` never vio - lates the harmony of sound or sense . ''

		Is that an echo of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's description , `` In the sure and flawless perfection of his rhythm and diction ... .

		.

		`` 1 It was Huxley , was it not , who imagined that
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's definition of tragedy would be , `` a generaliza - tion killed by a fact '' ?

		Enter Mr.
Mair	PERSON	's un - guarded `` never '' followed by this irrecon - cilable fact from the Ninth Book of `` Paradise Lost '' -LRB- 11.41 .

		ff . -RRB-

		: '' Mee of these Nor skilld nor studious , higher Argument Remaines , sufficient of it self to raise That name , unless an age too late , or cold Climat , or Years damp my intended wing Deprest , and much they may , if all be mine . ''

		Yes , the good
Milton	PERSON	sometimes nods , as his best critic ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, frankly admits , stating the matter thus : '' I could point out to you five hundred passages in
Milton	LOCATION	upon which labor has been bestowed , and twice five hundred more to which additional labor would have been serviceable ; not that I regret the absence of such labor , because no poem contains more proof of skill acquired by practice . ''

		Nor would better critics , I believe , go so far as to say with Mr.
Mair	PERSON	that
Milton	PERSON	' ' devised his own subjects , and wrote his own style , '' or that `` he stands alone , and must be judged alone '' ;
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, indeed , says some - thing different .

		Granting that
Milton	PERSON	's soul was like a star , and dwelt apart , we can not judge the poet by himself , since there is no astronomy , or other science , of the individual .

		His subjects were the common property of
England	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, and his treat - ment of them was profoundly influenced by the Italian interpretation of ancient poetical theory .

		To tell the truth , Mr.
Mair	PERSON	, as his over - praise evinces , is not in sympathy with
Milton	PERSON	, but with traditional notions about the poet , unrectified by scholarly observation and com - parison of the facts .

		As a result , coming to the point in
Milton	LOCATION	's biography where sympa - thy is most needed , he rashly declares that `` Milton always argued from himself to man - kind at large , '' and falls into the vulgar error of associating the Miltonic writings on divorce too closely with
Milton	PERSON	's private life .

		Are they not , rather , singularly objective , and is there anything better on the subject in En - glish ?

		The spirit of them is altogether in keeping w r ith the ideal of good manners rep - resented in the speeches of
Adam	PERSON	and Eve , almost constantly , in `` Paradise Lost , '' and constantly in the words and actions of the Hero in `` Paradise Regained . ''

		`` Manners , '' we recall , are one of the gifts which Words - worth , good poet and scholar , thinks to be in
Milton	LOCATION	's keeping for
England	LOCATION	.

		Turning to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, we again find Mr.
Mair	PERSON	using that dangerous word `` never '' : `` A study of the plots of either the comedies or the tragedies will convince the reader that the orderly faculty of marshalling events has never been so completely shown in the work of any other writer . ''

		What about Sophocles ?

		But perhaps we are to understand : any other English writer .

		Well , what about
Thackeray	PERSON	in `` The Rose and the Ring , '' or Fielding in `` Tom Jones '' ?

		`` What a master of composition Fielding was ! ''

		says
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		`` Upon my word , I think the ` Oedipus Tyrannus , ' ` The Alchem - ist , ' and `
Tom Jones	PERSON	' the three most perfect plots ever planned . ''

		No Shakespearean scholar would have expressed himself as does Mr.
Mair	PERSON	; in the first place , none would put most of the comedies , in the matter of con - struction , on as high a level as most of the tragedies .

		And to sum up in the words of Mr.
A. C. Bradley	PERSON	on Shakespeare : 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	'' Nine-tenths of his defects are not ... the errors of an inspired genius , ignorant of art , but the sins of a great but negligent artist . ''

		Turning to the pages on
Wordsworth	PERSON	, we discover the same bent for overstatement , and for essentially the same sort of thread - bare comment as is passed along in certain handbooks of criticism and biography with which students are familiar .

		Thus : Words - worth is `` a complete innovator '' ; `` he found his subjects in new places '' ; in his earlier years he had a vision of `` nature , '' which eventually faded , so that only `` a few fine things fitfully illumine the enormous and dreary bulk of his later work '' ; '' if we lost all but the ` Lyrical Ballads , ' the poems of
1804	DATE	-LSB- misprint for
1807	DATE	-RSB- , and the ` Prelude , ' and the ` Excursion , '
Wordsworth	PERSON	's position as a poet would be no lower than it is now . ' '

		Does Mr.
Mair	PERSON	realize that he has included three - quarters of the poet 's work ?

		The bulk of what is left is not enormous .

		The other assertions also need reconsideration .


Wordsworth	PERSON	is not a complete innovator : in part he harks back to his favorite `` elder poets '' more especially to Spenser and
Milton	PERSON	.

		Substituting England for
Sicily	LOCATION	and the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, one may say that
Wordsworth	PERSON	finds his subjects where The - ocritus found them ; and that is just what he tells us in the Eighth Book of the `` Prelude . ''

		In his earlier period his imagination was tinged with a neo-Platonism which , while not very good of its kind , still counts as `` poetry '' with the average reader of the present .

		That is , when
Wordsworth	PERSON	talks about a motion and a spirit `` rolling '' through various things , peo - ple think him inspired , though they may not care for his translation of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's address `` To the Supreme Being , '' which contains a very different form of teaching .

		Wordsworth gradually outgrew his crude naive philosophy , and , drawing his inspira - tion less and less from neo-Platonism , and more and more from Christianity , produced a body of verse that in workmanship is superior to his earlier attempts .

		Much of it is likely to attract well-educated readers of subsequent generations , when the doctrine of divine imma - nence gives way , as it gave way in Words - worth , to a more artistic conception of the universe .

		There are not `` a few , '' but many `` fine things '' in the `` Ecclesiastical Sonnets , '' that most important of his later writings ; it is a body of work that naturally falls into its place with the writings of
Herbert	PERSON	and
Keble	LOCATION	; and a critic who aims at maintaining an indi - vidual point of view -LRB- which means observing and comparing for himself -RRB- can not afford to treat it as it is treated in ordinary books of criticism and biography .

		Though he now and then lapses into an overfamiliar style , and though , as we have seen , his judgments lack finality , Mr.
Mair	PERSON	on the whole is naturally alert , and expresses things for himself , often with vigor , and sometimes with felicity .

		He duly insists upon looking at the history of literature in the light of fundamental principles , and on occasion enunciates such doctrine as the following -LRB- pp. 47-48 -RRB- : '' The unit of all ordinary kinds of writing is the word , and one is not commonly quarrelled with for using words that have belonged to other people .

		But the unit of the lyric , like the unit of spoken conversation , is not the word but the phrase .

		Now in daily human intercourse the use , which is uni - versal and habitual , of set forms and phrases of talk is not commonly supposed to detract from or destroy sincerity .

		In the crises , indeed , of emotion it must be most people 's experience that the natural speech that rises unbidden and easiest to the lips is something quite familiar and commonplace , some form which the accumulated experience of many generations of separate people has found best for such circumstances or such an occasion .

		The lyric is in the position of conversation at such a height - ened and emotional moment ... This is not to say that there is no such thing as originality ; a poet is a poet first and most of all because he discovers truths that have been known for ages , as things that are fresh and new and vital for himself . ''

		A word of praise must be given to the six - teen portraits scattered through the volume .

		The one of
Wordsworth	PERSON	-LRB- p. 220 -RRB- , reproducing the sketch by
Pickersgill	PERSON	in the Library of
St. John 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, though not well known , is a fortunate choice .

		AN ICONOCLAST IN ARCHITECTURAL , CRITICISM .

		* Mr.
Geoffrey Scott	PERSON	's `` The Architecture of Humanism : A Study in the History of Taste '' breaks sharply with the traditions of English criticism by attacking the formulas on which the apotheoses of Greek and of Gothic art have been based and boldly cham - pioning the architecture of the Renaissance .

		In the mind of the author the book is an at - tempt to formulate the chief aesthetic princi - ples of classical design in architecture , and to trace the history of our critical canons ; in reality it is a violent polemic against earlier opinions and a dogmatic apologia for a style deified in advance .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL a needful service .

		The working belief of the contemporary artist and critic of art is too often a jumble of incongruous fragments from earlier systems , patched together without ap - preciation of their inconsistency or true his - torical relations .

		The text in hand brings order into this confusion , distinguishing , very justly , successive phases in the development of critical dogmas .

		On the academic method of imitation of the antique and search for per - fect mathematical proportions , followed the romantic idealization first of
Greece	LOCATION	and then of the Middle Ages , passing over into the cult of the natural and the picturesque .

		Then fol - lowed the ethical evaluation of styles by
Ruskin	PERSON	and his followers , the mechanical or structural evaluation of Violet-le-Duc , and finally the biological , evolutionary explana - tion of compulsion from environment which still dominates criticism .

		Obviously any of these interpretations singly , or all of them together , can not exhaust the aesthetic values of architecture .

		There will still remain purely spacial relationships , eluding even the aca - demic formula ?

		.

		To call all previous views `` fallacies '' out of hand , however , as does Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, betrays a failure to realize their par - tial validity , as well as a lack of historic modesty .

		The substitute which he has to offer , the `` humanist '' evaluation , is not , we find , the theory of the humanists themselves , but a modern psychological doctrine , humanist only in a curious sense Professor
Lipps	PERSON	's theory of Einfuhlung .

		This familiar hypothesis , which Mr.
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	has already ap - plied to Renaissance painting , explains our aesthetic sensations as unconscious projections into the external world of our own bodily movements and tensions .

		To illustrate , arches seem to ``
spring	DATE	, '' domes to `` swell , '' and spires to ' ' soar , ' ' because we identify ourselves with their apparent states .

		If one were dis - posed to jest , one might say that Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's own fallacy had been added in advance , by his own arch-villain ,
Ruskin	PERSON	, to the romantic , the ethical , the mechanical , and the biologic falla - cies which he himself has condemned .

		It is the pathetic fallacy , a poetic animism , digni - fied by a modern and philosophic garb .

		`` With - out entering seriously upon its merits , we may suggest that its truth or falsity is really irrele - vant to Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's more concrete propositions that mass , space , line , and coherence are the true language of architecture , and that
Renais	PERSON	- sance architecture , which speaks this language with least restraint , is the style in which archi - tectural principles can most fruitfully be studied .

		The importance of abstract qualities like mass , line , and space is recognized by aesthetic philosophers whose systems are most diverse or antagonistic .

		Even one who has given such a wide extension to the aesthetic field as
Signor Benedetto Croce	PERSON	sees in them the channels for those expressions peculiar to architecture , in - capable of translation into other media .

		The idea that they exhaust its values , however , is an intolerable limitation , and one which , un - just to other styles , does Renaissance archi - tecture itself less than justice .

		We must turn against the author 's dogmatic assertions , his own protest against earlier apologies : ' ' Con - ducted without impartiality , arguments such as these are but the romance of criticism ; they can intensify and decorate our preju - dices , but can not render them convincing . ''

		It is true that a sympathetic estimate of Renaissance architecture must depend on an appreciation of abstract , spacial qualities , but it is equally true that an extension of the abstract criterion to other styles as the one principle of judgment would be as illegiti - mate as similar extensions of mechanical or biological criteria .

		Perhaps Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's brilliant and forceful rhetoric , in spite of the over - emphasis which arouses protest at almost every page , is the only weapon by which popular prejudices , themselves partly rhetorical in origin , can be beaten down .

		It is a pity , though , if the rhetorical bias of English criticism is so strong as to deprive us permanently of discussion which is measured and temperate .

Gaunt	PERSON	is a pro- fessional writer of fiction and stories of travel .

		`` Forces Mining and
Undermining China	LOCATION	'' is , we regret to say , lacking in that orderly analysis and mastery of material which wins the confidence of the reader in the judgment of the writer .

		The book contains valuable information concerning mining , railways , labor , finances , and concessions in
China	LOCATION	, and is well worth a rapid survey ; but it lacks maturity of judgment and dignity of expres - sion .

		`` Thirty Years in the Manchu Capital '' is , on the other hand , a work of unusual merit .

		A simple , unpretentious account of events that have come under the author 's personal ob - servation and experiences through which he has passed , the book throws much light upon two wars fought on Chinese territory the Chino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese conflicts and gives the reader definite impressions of Chinese character through sketches of various individual Chinese known to the author .

		The method and style of the book are natural and entertaining .

		The author wins without effort the confidence and respect of the reader , and his kindly and favorable estimate of the Chi - nese carries a high degree of conviction .

		There is , however , very little effort at generalizing , so that the book furnishes evidence rather than argument in connection with the problem of
China	LOCATION	.

		Among recent publications dealing with this problem no book we have seen possesses the literary merit of Mrs.
Gaunt	PERSON	's `` A Woman in
China	LOCATION	. ' '

		Entering the country by the Sibe - rian Railway in mid-winter shortly after the Revolution , the author spent some weeks in Peking observing and studying , and then trav - elled without companion by cart to Jehol , Inner
Mongolia	LOCATION	, the ancient hunting palace and grounds of the Manchu emperors .

		Her opportunity for forming an independent im - pression of the Chinese was , thus , very differ - ent from that of the ordinary tourist , and her training as a writer has enabled her to pro- duce one of the most entertaining and pleas - ing of books on the subject .

		Artistic by tem - perament , Mrs.
Gaunt	PERSON	has filled her pages with sketches from life , vivid and delightful .

		Her appreciation of Chinese architecture and landscape gardening is more earnest and out - spoken than that of any writer we recall .

		In - deed , `` A Woman in
China	LOCATION	'' is a rather unusual blend of keen observation , humor , sympathy , and artistic sense .

		An artist , however , is a delineator and in - terpreter of the static present , not a guide or a prophet .

		Possessed completely by the sem - blance before the eyes and concerned in its reproduction through the medium of art , the artist lacks a sense for the future , as yet invisi - ble and wholly unpicturesque .

		In spite of her evident good judgment , Mrs.
Gaunt	PERSON	is , first of all , an artist .

		The
China	LOCATION	which seemed to her antique and static , ancient Babylon still sur - viving in the midst of a novel and alien world , does not thus appear to Dr.
Christie	PERSON	, who has witnessed the changes of only three decades .

		Even the most gifted observer may be so engrossed by the quaint and outre in features , costume , manners , and age-long habits that he requires years , rather than weeks , to penetrate behind these veils which conceal the essential human spirit .

		Diversity in outward mani - festations does not disprove the unity of the human soul in all the races of men .

		The civ - ilization of any race may be slowly trans - formed by the working of new forces brought to bear upon it , and such forces are now at work in
China	LOCATION	.

		Scandinavian literature in One of the main purposes of the .

		.

		^ American-Scandinavian b oun - dation , established in
1911	DATE	by the generous bequest of
Niels Poulsen	PERSON	, is to publish English translations of important Scandinavian literary works .

		That purpose has now become achievement to the extent of three interesting volumes that offer us the first fruits of this aspect of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	's enterprise .

		Two of the volumes , devoted to
Holberg	PERSON	and
Tegner	PERSON	, are entitled `` Scandina - vian Classics '' ; the third , `` The Voyages of the Norsemen to
America	LOCATION	, '' is the first issue of a series of '' Scandivanian Monographs . ''

		The
Holberg	PERSON	volume is singularly welcome
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 21 and opportune .

		It offers three of the come - dies , in a translation made by Dr.
Oscar James Campbell	PERSON	and Mr.
Frederic Schenck	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	, it will be remembered , gave us last
spring	DATE	a study of
Holberg	PERSON	which was the first work in the English language upon the greatest of all Scandinavian authors .

		We now have three comedies representing the playwright who completes the great trinity of modern writers of comedy
Moliere , Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	, and
Holberg	PERSON	.

		The selection is the best pos - sible ``
Jeppe	PERSON	paa Bjerget , '' `` Den Poli - kiske Kandstober , '' and ''
Erasmus Mon	PERSON	- tanus , ' ' a selection in striking contrast to that made a year or two ago by a retired English army officer , who gave us three of the least significant and characteristic of the comedies in a singularly w r ooden translation .

		Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	's three represent
Holberg	PERSON	at his best , and his version is nervous , colloquial , and faithful .

		The
Tegner	PERSON	volume , edited by Mr.
Paul Robert Lieder	PERSON	, offers a reprint of old matter
Longfellow	PERSON	's `` The Children of the Lord 's Supper '' and
W. L. Blackley	PERSON	's ^ `
Frithiof	PERSON	's Saga '' the latter first printed in
1857	DATE	.

		This is a fair translation no bet - ter than several others of the score or more that exist , but it has the distinction of having been the first to be printed in this country .

		Commander
William Hovgaard	PERSON	's treatise on `` The Voyages of the Norsemen to
America	LOCATION	'' is planned on a large scale , and makes a vol - ume of three hundred pages , abundantly illus - trated .

		So much work has been done in this field of recent years that a comprehensive statement of the theories and conclusions of modern scholars is a very desirable thing to have , and the author is well equipped for the performance .

		He treats of his subject as an historical critic , a naturalist , an archaeologist and ethnologist , and especially as an expert in nautical matters and geography .

		The treatment of all these matters is minute and exhaustive .

		With regard to controverted points , it may be said that he regards the saga narratives as essentially historical , in opposition to
Nansen	ORGANIZATION	's belief in their legen - dary character ; that he believes the
Skrael	PERSON	- ings in some instances to have been Indians and not Eskimos ; that he holds the vinber to have been grapes rather than currants or cranberries , and Vinland -LRB- with the long vowel -RRB- to have really meant
Wineland	LOCATION	; and he offers evidence that the site of
Leif	PERSON	's set - tlement may well have been as far south as the coast of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps the most valuable part of the work is its detailed de - scription of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast from
Baffin Land	LOCATION	to the
Hudson	LOCATION	, and its attempts to identify the shores described in the sagas with actual parts of the American continent .

		The whole question is bewildering and baf - fling , and Commander
Hovgaard	PERSON	has probably done all that is scientifically possible to shed light upon it .

		He has no hobbies , and this is perhaps the most important prerequisite for the handling of the whole complex problem .

		Mr.
Ernest Newman	PERSON	in his book it tl
Wagner	PERSON	as Man and Artist '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- gives us a full length painting of the remarkable musician and dramatist .

		He says in his Preface : `` In spite of the size of this volume , many readers will no doubt feel that it either discusses inadequately several aspects of
Wagner	PERSON	's work and personality or it passes them over altogether .

		I plead guilty ; but to have fol - lowed
Wagner	PERSON	up in every one of his many - sided activities in all his political , ethical , economic , ethnical , sociological speculations would have necessitated not one book but four . ''

		And yet he says farther on : `` While there is at present no adequate life of Wag - ner , there is probably more biographical mate - rial available in connection with him than with any other artist who has lived ; and on the basis of this material it seems justifiable now to attempt what was impossible until the publication of Mein Leben in
1911	DATE	a complete and psychological estimate of him . ''

		We do not feel that the two statements can be made to agree , and we find , indeed , that in the long discussion of ``
Wagner	PERSON	as a Man / ' there are principally presented the relations of
Wagner	PERSON	with his wife ,
Minna	PERSON	, and the other women who contrived to make his life disappointing and miserable until
Cosima Wagner	PERSON	made her appearance .

		A treatment of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's relations to politics , government , economics , might have been undertaken with - out detriment to a subject like friendships with the other sex , which ought in every case to be kept within the limits which belong to it .

		Mr.
Newman	PERSON	could have compressed the love episodes , and enlarged the consideration of other sides of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's character without becoming prolix or lessening the value of his picture .

		He could have led up to his superb summary by a completer exposition of the varied interests of this restless and cosmopoli - tan artist .

		We also question the advisability of considering the form , to the exclusion of the content , of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		We see this course taken and advocated in the second part of the book , `` The Artist in Theory . ''

		It would seem that a discussion of Wag - ner 's power of character representation , his mastery of material , his immense advances in technique , would be enhanced by adequate 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	statements of his intent and purpose .

		Such was undoubtedly the opinion of the com - poser , and the reproduction of his idea in completely congruous music was his great effort and purpose .

		It is unquestionably in the third part of his volume , `` The Artist in Practice , '' that Mr.
Newman	PERSON	finds himself most at home , and it is here that the reader will find him most convincing and authorita - tive .

		Whatever our views may be of
Wagner	PERSON	and his work , we must take into account this book of Mr.
Newman	PERSON	's .

		All the great ques - tions in regard to
Wagner	PERSON	's achievement are here considered with insight .

		We may not agree with Mr.
Newman	PERSON	's conclusions , but we must concede his knowledge , his depth of appreciation , his eloquence of expression .

		No book on the subject will appeal to a larger circle of readers , nor give a more vivid con - ception of the whole movement .

		Insect biog - raphies , new The charm of
M. J. H. Fabre	PERSON	's .

		, .

		,
Souvenicr Entomologiques	PERSON	, published in
1882	DATE	and now translated by Mr.
Alexander Teixeira De Mattos	PERSON	, has its origin in the author 's enthusi - asm for his researches , in his skill in building up the reader 's interest in his observations and experiments , and in a certain naive un - sophisticated simplicity .

		The translator has preserved the latter admirably in `` The Mason-bees '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the latest volume in the series of translations of
M. Fabre	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		This deals with the habits and instincts of certain solitary mud-working bees of southern
Europe	LOCATION	and touches upon the operation and origin of such fundamental bio - logical phenomena as the homing instinct in bees , ants , and cats , and the origin of the semi - parasitic habits of those bees which , like the cuckoos among birds , lay their eggs in nests not their own .

		The author is a keen observer , with an experimental turn of mind , and puts to test his theories of sight and memory as guiding factors in the homeward movements of insects .

		The translation is excellently done save for a few lapses into archaic terms .

		While
M. Fabre	PERSON	depends wholly upon word pictures to charm his reader ,
Ward	PERSON	's `` Insect Biographies with Pen and Camera '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- supplements these by plates in color and heliotype and excellent half-tones .

		The book aims to present the life histories of certain of the representative insects , such as the lace - wing fly , various moths and butterflies , the `` death watch '' beetles , the hover-fly , and the flea , and adds to these some account of mites and spiders .

		The photographs are nearly all from life , and the attitudes of the subjects por - trayed are therefore normal .

		Both the pho - tographer and the engraver have succeeded exceptionally well in their work .

		Intensive study directed to a few carefully selected types and carried to a high degree of com - pleteness characterizes this work and lifts it above the level of the ordinary `` nature study '' treatment of entomological topics .

		tended work written by a con - scientious scholar of mature years ; but a dutiful reviewer is bound to ask what useful end can be served by Professor
E. G. Sihler	PERSON	's large volume on `` Cicero of Arpinum '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The gifted
Tully	ORGANIZATION	, so unanimously lauded as an orator , so bitterly debated as a statesman , has been the subject of many pens , and a new treatise on a large scale can be justified only by unique historical acumen or some singular felicity of presenta - tion .

		To the latter qualification our volume can make no claim whatever ; in fact , a rigor - ous effort is necessary to hold oneself to the task of reading it , so dispiriting is the style even to the most loyal student , so painful to any reader with the least literary feeling .

		If the editors of a great university press , like that of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, can not ensure a passably good general presentation , they might at least pre - clude annoying violations of elementary gram - mar and punctuation .

		Naturally , however , almost any failure in English would be gladly forgiven if the work were distinguished by an unusually keen sense for human character and motives , by some fine gift of perspective , some compelling profundity of judgment , some comprehensive faculty of grouping the particular and universal together , in short , by some exceptional power of dealing with history in biography .

		But , unfortunately , one misses these high essentials , and finds in - stead average ability , unsparing toil , and meticulous scholarship .

		However , we are glad to accord most unstinted praise to one noble quality , an absolute honesty of purpose that shines from every page .

		There is a care - fully arranged bibliography , followed by an index .

		That quality of lyric poetry observations of which lies in the unquestioning a flat-dweller .

		.

		, * .

		.

		, j assumption that the reader is as much interested in the poet 's private affairs as the poet himself , reveals itself quite en - gagingly on every page of Mr.
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	's `` Belshazzar Court '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , the supposed account of the family affairs and certain other intimate concerns of a young married couple and their two children in their
1915	DATE	-RSB- 23 life on the third floor of a mammoth apart - ment house in the far up-town regions of
New York	LOCATION	.

		As in Mr.
Edward S. Martin	PERSON	's `` Reflections of a Beginning Husband , '' which the book strongly resembles in some of its features , it is the young head of the family who acts as scribe , and who realistically pic - tures the pleasures and a few of the vexations of domestic life in a household just a little less prosperous , pecuniarily , than its tastes , its refinement , its ideals , might have rendered desirable .

		The entrance hall of
Belshazzar Court	ORGANIZATION	has handsome electroliers in imitation cut glass , a magnificent marble fireplace in which the effect of a wood fire is simulated by electric bulbs under a sheet of red isinglass , while the heat is furnished by a steam radiator close by , and the floor has two large Oriental rugs of American manufacture .

		What the humorously communicative young father has to say about his irrepressible son
Harold	PERSON	and the latter 's baby sister , about his wife
Emme	PERSON	- line , and , not least of all , about himself , his interests and diversions , his views of things metropolitan and cosmopolitan and miscella - neous , will be found entertainingly set forth in the eight discursive chapters of the book , which , it will be discovered by magazine read - ers , is not an entirely new production , though none the worse for that fact .

		Mr.
Strunsky	PERSON	has in the last few years made a name for him - self as a humorist of decidedly original qual - ity , and `` Belshazzar Court '' sustains this reputation .

		Mr.
M. L. Spencer	PERSON	's `` Practical En g lish Punctuation '' contains much more matter than its title implies ; it is really a compendium of direc - tions for the preparation of almost any kind of manuscript .

		It has no discussion of the principles of punctuation , and presents noth - ing new in organization or arrangement ; for the sake of brevity the directions are usually given as dogmatic rules .

		The basis of these rules is the practice of the more conservative magazines and the more careful writers of the present day , and wherever usage varies , what appears to be the preferred practice is indi - cated .

		Of course the first edition of such a compendium provokes some adverse criticism .

		The specimen sheet of corrected proof with the accompanying explanation is not so ser - viceable as it should have been made , some of the statements are very awkwardly phrased or are capable of misinterpretation , and occa - sionally the rules are too broadly stated .

		But such defects are not numerous .

		The rules are generally sound and clearly illustrated , the material is made readily accessible through a fine index , the presswork is very satisfactory , and typographical errors are notably absent .

		The volume should largely realize the hope expressed in the Preface that it `` may be found to be a compact , convenient , and rea - sonably full compendium of rules for the guidance of all persons who have need to write . ' '

		Mr.
Walter A. Mursell	PERSON	knew TZSSBSE himself at the age of ten to be a book-lover , and at twelve be - gan to be a book-buyer , taking delight in browsing about old bookshops .

		To him `` they are what form and outline and color are to the artist , what beauty is to the poet , what springtime is to the lover , what
summer	DATE	meadows are to the child . ' '

		That such a person should write well about books is no cause for surprise .

		`` Byways in Bookland '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- consists of a series of `` confessions and digressions , '' informal and intimate and alto - gether delightful .

		In a chatty , autobiograph - ical fashion Mr.
Mursell	PERSON	tells us of the birth of a book-lover , his first footsteps in bookland , the comradeship of books , the green pastures and still waters of bookland , its valley of twi - light , the spurs of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, a brown study , a recent byway , and , finally , emerging from byways , he pays tribute to two great writers who hold first place in his heart ,
Dickens	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		After a page of almost ex - travagant eulogy of Mr.
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	, and more especially of his book , `` In the Midst of Life , '' he shows his imperfect acquaintance with that author by saying , ' ' I believe this is his solitary book : at any rate , on this side the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		One might object to his spelling in the chapter where he glows with enthusi - asm for `` The Arabian Nights '' and writes of `` Sinbad '' and '' Scheherezade . ''

		Mr.
Mur	PERSON	- sell 's `` confessions and digressions '' are all excellent , largely because they are sincere and unpretentious , and are written , not to make a book , but because the mere writing is a pleasure .

		A thoughtful discussion of poverty .

		`` Now , in our own day , the conquest of poverty looms up as an economic possibility , defi - nitely within reach if only society desire it sufficiently and will pay enough to achieve it . ''

		Such are the heartening words that close the tiny volume , ' ' The Abolition of Pov - erty '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , wherein Professor
Hollan	PERSON	- der of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	treats the problem that he regards as the heart and centre of social disturbance .

		He believes that poverty is needless , and this hopeful tenet 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	brightens a sane and succinct discussion of such topics as ' ' The Distribution of Income , ' ' `` The Rate of Wages , '' `` The Underpaid , '' and `` The Unemployable . ''

		On the whole our economist is `` unwilling save as a last resort to venture upon the uncharted sea of socialism , '' and seeks a solution of the prob - lem in constructive social regulation .

		Here - with he proposes to `` retain the competitive system of industry , both as to production and distribution , but to impose thereon , by re - straint of law and by pressure of public opin - ion , such limitation and control as experience demonstrates to be necessary for the largest social interest . ''

		However , the academic socialist , at least , need worry but little over this formal repudiation ; for our author really believes in drastic measures , and with reasoned warmth expresses approval of not a few specific remedies that would have been decried as the rankest of socialism only a decade or two ago .

		If you get old-age pen - sions , a minimum wage , insurance against unemployment , and half a score other amen - datory measures , and if these operate success - fully along with state postal systems , state telegraphs and telephones , state canals , state education , and what not , it will rapidly become less difficult to look upon the ever chang - ing proposals of socialistic thinkers with fear - less eyes .

		In any event , such books as the modest study before us deserve the warmest welcome .

		In fact , we are even prepared to hope that some day `` The Abolition of Pov - erty '' will be available at about a third of the present price , although this is by no means unreasonable .

		A brief survey `` Elizabethan Literature '' by of the Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	has just been added to the `` Home Uni - versity Library , ' ' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It presents logically and as com - prehensively as the two hundred and fifty pages will permit the multiform activities of the age .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	has a first-hand ac - quaintance with Elizabethan writers .

		Apart from
Middleton	LOCATION	, whom he barely mentions among the later dramatists , he slights none of them ; and he gives much space , too much perhaps , to the smaller fry .

		In a work of this kind , do Phaer , Twine ,
Fleming	PERSON	, and Stanyhurst , those wretched translators of
Virgil	LOCATION	, deserve attention ?

		Will not Surrey suffice for the man whose university is at home ?

		In matters of opinion Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is nearly always safe and usually forceful .

		He argues vigorously , for example , that `` the vital divergence '' between English and French drama is not `` an expression of the divergent minds or temperaments of the two nations '' ; but that `` the very freedom of action in the French popular drama , trans - gressing all bounds of decency , ... made possible the reaction to strict classicism . ''

		Sometimes Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is incautious in statement , however , as when he says that
Marlowe	PERSON	' ' was more than audacious in his free thinking , '' and that Lyly `` showed the way '' in delicate lyrics .

		And when in his bibliographical note he refers to the `` careful texts '' of the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	and
Craig	PERSON	editions , but ignores the
Neilson	PERSON	edition , we wonder whether he is really unaware of so notable an achievement of American scholarship .

		Under the title `` The Life of a ?

		nd a iitar demic L i ttle College '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Professor
Archibald MacMechan	PERSON	has collected a number of papers dealing with such themes as , `` Little College Girls , '' `` The Vanity of Travel , '' `` Tennyson as Artist , '' `` Child of the Ballads , '' `` Every - body 's Alice , '' and `` Virgil . ''

		All of the essays are pleasing for their reflection of a well stocked mind and amiable personality , as well as for their well ordered English , which a college instructor would characterize as having an agreeable literary flavor with no disturbing smack of pedantry .

		Probably the most valuable chapter bears the caption `` Evangeline and the Real Acadians '' ; al - though old
Toronto	LOCATION	men will enjoy the pic - ture of the unique bedel , McKim , and the full-hearted eulogy of Professor
Young	PERSON	in `` This is Our Master . ''

		To one who remem - bers the less mature views of Professor MacMechan on the worthlessness of classical studies , it is joyous to read his graceful palinode in the closing pages .

		Most of the papers have appeared before , and we have enjoyed many of them as they are now pre - sented ; but it would be too much to say that there is enough matter of exceptional value or profundity in the individual essays to com - pensate for their lack of unity and make them widely acceptable to the reading public in their collected form .

Cawein	PERSON	published more than a score of books of verses .

		Eight years ago a complete edi - tion of his poems , which was published with an Introduction by Mr.

		60 AN AMERICAN LITERATURE .

		Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	is of the opin - ion that American literature has no existence apart from English literature .

		His opinion , since he is nothing if not orthodox in his view of literature , is probably that of the majority of those who have considered the point .

		We are inclined to agree with him as to the fact .

		But Professor
Matthews	PERSON	offers an explanation which is something more than an interpreta - tion of history .

		It is a bold prophecy of the future .

		And who agrees with a prophet ?

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	says , in his
Introduc	PERSON	- tion to `` The Oxford Book of American Essays , '' that : '' Of course , when we consider it carefully we can not fail to see that the literature of a language is one and indivisible and that the nativity or the domicile of those who make it matters nothing .

		Just as Alexandrian literature is Greek , so Amer - ican literature is English ; and as Theocritus de - mands inclusion in any account of Greek literature , so Thoreau can not be omitted from any history of English literature as a whole .

		The works of
Anthony Hamilton	PERSON	and
Rousseau	PERSON	, Mme. de Stael and
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	are not more indisputably a part of the literature of the French language than the works of
Franklin and Emerson	PERSON	, of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	and
Poe	PERSON	are part of the literature of the English language . ''

		In other words , American literature is a part of English literature and must always and inevitably continue to be so unless we on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	should develop a new language .

		It is only fair to add that after having thus denied the possibility of nationality in litera - ture -LRB- within the same language -RRB- , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	goes on to admit that owing to a slight difference in the social atmosphere and the social organization of the
United States	LOCATION	there is `` an indefinable and intangible flavor which distinguishes ''
Franklin	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, and
Mark Twain	PERSON	from
Steele	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and Lamb ; that the writ - ers of this country `` can not help having the note of their own nationality . ''

		But it is evi - dent that he considers the difference subtle rather than important .

		Whether the difference is important or not depends on whether it is now as great as it will ever be .

		It has not in the least occurred 38 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	to Professor
Matthews	PERSON	that the time may come when life in the
United States	LOCATION	will be as differ - ent from life in the
British Isles	LOCATION	as life in
Russia	LOCATION	now is .

		But that is among the possi - bilities of the future .

		An identity of language may be the strong - est connection between two nations .

		Language is the mother of ideas ; indeed , words are ideas .

		To own the same language has always meant to own the same feeling about funda - mental things .

		However greatly the next cen - tury may change either the Americans or the English , they will tend strongly to remain together in their conception of life , not merely because many of the same forces will act upon both but because each will so easily communicate and exchange with the other .

		Nevertheless , there are political , geograph - ical , and racial factors which may profoundly modify our present likeness to
England	LOCATION	.

		The case of politics , particularly of international relations , has been discussed so much that we need only mention it .

		The great war in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope may not affect us in any direct or impor - tant way ; it may not greatly affect the future of the British Isles .

		But the possibilities are obvious enough .

		The effects of geographical conditions on national character have only begun to be studied , and are little understood ; but the idea that the climate of the
United States	LOCATION	is producing an American type , distinct from the British , may be something more than an academic theory ; and climate is only one of several aspects of geography .

		The part which race plays in making national character is , of course , the most important ; and nothing is clearer than that the blood of the American people is no longer the blood of the British Isles .

		It is true that the English , Scotch , and Irish founded the republic ; and their ideas politi - cal , social , and moral still dominate it .

		The twenty or thirty American essayists whom Professor
Matthews	PERSON	has included in his an - thology are those of men whose ancestors came from the British Isles .

		And if tw T o of the most inexcusable defects of his choice w r ere cor - rected , the omission of
Mark Twain	PERSON	and the inclusion of Mr.
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, this fact would not be altered .

		Indeed , it is a typi - cal fact .

		American writers have so far been quite as English in blood as they have been in language .

		The same could be said of nineteen out of twenty Americans distinguished by other than literary achievement from
1776	DATE	to now .

		It could almost be said of the educated classes .

		The proportion of English names in a list of the undergraduates at
Dartmouth	LOCATION	or Princeton or
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is still large , though not as large as it was .

		It is only when one exam - ines the roll of
Columbia	LOCATION	, where Jewish names are very numerous ; or of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, where it is German names ; or of
Minnesota	LOCATION	, where it is Norse names , that the coming change is appar - ent .

		The immigrants from the south of
Europe	LOCATION	, even the Russians , will be slower to send their sons and daughters to the universi - ties than the immigrants of Teutonic stock have been .

		But whether they send them or not , they will need only to remain here to modify us .

		The battle of ideas is never still .

		We think of the German citizens of this country as differing with the older American stock only in respect to the institution of beer , of the Norse peoples as distinguished by no differ - ence of custom or ideas , of the Jews as a race peculiarly adaptable ; and as for the Italians , the Greeks , the Slavs we think they do not count at all .

		We should know better .

		We should realize that when `` Who 's Who '' no longer presents a preponderance of Brit - ish names , American institutions will have changed .

		But in addition to the battle of ideas there is the struggle of blood , which is only occasion - ally fought out with rifles as it is now being fought out in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		All the w r hite races represented in
America	LOCATION	are beginning to in - termarry .

		But biology does not promise that the result will be a composite type in which the characters we call Anglo-Saxon will predominate .

		We in
America	LOCATION	may remain descendants of British ancestors in those char - acters which we care most about , we may continue our present institutions though it is to be hoped that we shall be able to ex - change some of them for better ones but we have no guarantee that this is in the nature of things .

		Indeed , we know that there is no assimilation of races without modification .

		We can not be certain that so much as the language will remain to us .

		Our vernacular may be so modified that there will be more difference between the speech of an American and an Englishman than there is now between the speech of an Italian and a Spaniard .

		But long before that happens we shall have begun to produce an American literature dis - tinct from English literature .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 39 CASUAL COMMENT .

		NATURE-STUDY TRANSMUTED INTO LITERA - TURE is what the reader finds , to his delight , in the books of such gifted naturalists as White of
Selborne	LOCATION	,
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, Tho - reau , Professor
Fabre	PERSON	, Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, and that other
John	PERSON	so commonly associated with `` John of the birds , '' namely ,
John Muir	PERSON	, or `` John of the mountains . ''

		Wide - spread is the regret caused by the death , on the day before
Christmas	DATE	, of the famous dis - coverer of glaciers , explorer of the wilds of many lands , geologist , naturalist , and writer -LRB- of too few books -RRB- .

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	was born at
Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
April 21 , 1838	DATE	; received a Spartan upbringing at the hands of a father who belonged decidedly to the old school ; migrated with that parent and a brother and sister to this country in
1849	DATE	, rural
Wisconsin	LOCATION	being the goal of their pil - grimage ; won for himself a university educa - tion , or such branches thereof as appealed to him , at
Madison	LOCATION	; and thereafter became a wandering student of the wonders of the uni - verse as displayed in more or less accessible quarters of this planet .

		Honorary degrees and society memberships and other distinc - tions came to him unsought , in sufficient abundance , and his name as author is at - tached to `` The Mountains of
California	LOCATION	, '' `` Our National Parks , '' `` Stickeen , the Story of a Dog , '' `` My First Summer in the Sierra , '' `` The Yosemite , '' and the extremely interesting account of his boyhood and youth which was the last book to come from his hand , though his fertility in magazine and other periodical articles continued to a later date .

		But he w r as too restless , too eager to be doing and seeing , to submit willingly to the drudgery , as he regarded it , of authorship .

		Perhaps he acquired an early distaste for the printed page , as contrasted with the mar - vellous book of nature , under the harsh discipline of his Dunbar schoolmaster , who compelled him to learn Latin and French and English grammars by heart , and of his father , who piled on top of that an immense amount of Bible-reading , making the boy commit to memory so many verses every day that , as the victim himself says , in terms that are hardly credible , by the time he was eleven years old he `` had about three-fourths of the Old Testament and all of the New by heart and by sore flesh .

		I could , '' he continues , '' recite the New Testament from the begin - ning of
Matthew	PERSON	to the end of Revelation without a single stop '' which , if true , would put even
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's feats of memory in the shade .

		But all this was a weariness and a vexa - tion to the outdoor enthusiast who , when his father told him and his brother
Davy	PERSON	that they need not learn their lessons for the next day , for they were `` gan to
America	LOCATION	thel morn , '' looked forward with ecstasy to the land where there was ' ' no more grammar , but boundless woods full of mysterious good things , trees full of sugar , growing in ground full of gold ; hawks , eagles , pigeons , filling the sky ; millions of birds ' nests , and no gamekeepers to stop us in all the wild , happy land .

		THE MIND 's GAMBOL is not the least of intel - lectual recreations .

		It is a pastime in which many a nimble-witted writer has found keen delight , to the no small enjoyment of his readers .


Walter Bagehot	PERSON	confessed his love for playing with his mind , as he phrased it .


Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's wit was what her sister , in writing of her soon after her death , called `` a Damascus blade gleaming and glancing in the sun . ''

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, her correspon - dent and trusted friend for a quarter of a century , wrote of her fondness for `` phrases so emphasized as to seem very wantonness of over-statement , as if she pleased herself with putting into words what the most ex - travagant might possibly think without say - ing . ''

		Her niece , in selecting and editing some passages of intimate correspondence for the current `` Atlantic , '' says that `` the joy of mere words was to Aunt Emily like red and yellow balls to the juggler , '' and speaks felici - tously of ' ' the gambol of her mind on paper , ' ' and of her pen `` scarcely hitting the paper long enough to make her communication intel - ligible . ''

		One might liken her style to the humming-bird , come and gone with a flash and a whir `` a resonance of emerald , a rush of cochineal , '' as she herself expresses it in some exquisite lines on that coruscating epi - tome of life and fire .

		Characteristic was her shy way of communicating by little scraps of letters with her brother 's family next door , `` a hedge away , '' as she put it , and separated by a lawn ' ' crossed by a ribbon path just wide enough for two who love . ''

		From the above - mentioned epistolary fragments a few spark - ling bits may here be not out of place .

		Their epigram sometimes verges on obscurity ; but to be obscure , argues
Coleridge	PERSON	, is sometimes complimentary to the reader .

		Here is a cryp - tic passage : `` To do a magnanimous thing and take one 's self by surprise , if one is not in the habit of him , is precisely the finest of joys .

		Not to do a magnanimous thing , notwithstanding it never be known , notwith - standing it cost us existence , is rapture her - self spurn . ''

		And again : `` To the faithful , absence is condensed presence .

		To the others but there are no others . ''

		To an absent THE DIAL -LSB-

		Should there be other Aprils we will perhaps dine . ''

		Her oddly apposite choice of adjectives is almost startling .

		A little nephew is told by her that `` Vinnie and Grandma and
Maggie	PERSON	all give their love , Pussy her striped respects . ''

		Often her little message takes the form of verse .

		Here is a picture of ineluctable fate : '' It stole along so stealthy , Suspicion it was done Was dim as to the wealthy Beginning not to own . ''

		A MARK TWAIN OF THE GHETTO Solo - mon

New Yorkers	LOCATION	, and of Americans in general , that it grieves one to think of the number of laughs and chuckles that will die unborn for the lack of a wiser choice , on Mr.
Rabinowitz	PERSON	's part , in selecting his literary vehicle .

		From his home city comes the report that he found himself interned -LRB- to all practical purposes -RRB- in
Germany	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	by the outbreak of the war , and it was only when his admirers on
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	, learning of his plight and bewailing the enforced suspension of his contribution to their merriment , clubbed to - gether and effected his deliverance , that he was able to return to these shores and resume his literary activities .

		In a passage , ostensi - bly autobiographic , translated for the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' he says : `` I am a Droschnar , which means I came from
Droschna	LOCATION	, a small town of the Poliver district a very small town .

		To-day

		When it became a railroad station the whole world envied us .

		Every - body thought it was a godsend , a chance of making a living .

		We would all grow rich , all begin shovelling gold .

		Jews from the sur - rounding villages began pouring into the city .

		We began to think of getting a new butcher , of building a new synagogue , and of putting aside another field for a ceme - tery .

		All in all , it was a great time . ''

		A touch of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	makes itself felt in the cemetery enterprise , but probably this author would like better to be commended for his own merits than for any borrowed -LRB- even un - consciously borrowed -RRB- excellence .

		His fun seems to be all his own , at times not over - refined , but what great humorist has escaped that criticism ?

		BIBLIOPATHOLOGY , if the word is allowable , was the subject of some characteristic re - marks from Dr.
Samuel McChord Crothers	PERSON	in a recent talk before the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Women 's Club .

		Playfully posing as the mouthpiece of his friend Bagster , founder of the
Bibliopathic Institute	ORGANIZATION	for the Book Treat - ment , the speaker discoursed entertainingly and wittily on `` The Therapeutic Value of Literature . ''

		A new definition of literature was , in passing , struck out somewhat as fol - lows : ' ' Literature is a vast stock of thoughts in a variety of forms that have been thought over by interesting people and have become so organized that they are not only food but medicine for others . ''

		Considering a book as a literary prescription put up by a competent person , the lecturer goes on to say that `` a proper prescription contains four constitu - ents , a basis , or chief ingredient , an adju - tant to assist the action , a corrective to lessen any evil effects , and a vehicle to make it suit - able for administration and pleasant to the patient .

		These constituents may be used to test the literary style of books .

		For instance ,
Henry James	PERSON	, one of whose sentences may be read at one sitting , has a sound basis , with parenthetical clauses to provide the vehicle , a corrective to lessen any evil effects , but lacks the adjutant to quicken the action . ''

		In similar pleasant vein the speaker observes that `` the young people of each generation are the poison squad for the new books .

		If they sur - vive , then the older people , whose maxim is ` safety first , ' begin to take up the same books .

		Then there are the counter-irritants , often confused with true stimulants .

		A counter - irritant makes the patient forget irritation in one part of the body by creating disturbance in another part .

		In medicine , mustard and turpentine are counter-irritants ; in literary values
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is the best counter-irritant .

		This is the type of book that makes you feel bad in a new spot .

		They make you see yourself as those see you who do n't like you . ''

		A BLAST FROM
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is interesting , as it is perhaps flattering , to see myself bracketed with the late
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	-LRB- in your leader of
November 1	DATE	on '' The Younger Gen - eration '' as a sort of alternate cock-shy for warring poets , but I can not admit that you have accurately denned the issue .

		This issue as I see it is not whether young poets '' believe '' in me or in
Tenny	PERSON	- son , but whether or no they believe that poetry had traditions , even traditional freedoms before , say ,
1876	DATE	; whether poetry is good or bad according to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 41 some standard derivable from the full mass of poetry of
Greece	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and the world generally , or whether poetry is good or bad according to the taste of American magazine editors of
1876	DATE	.

		I still preserve the illusion that there once were American magazine editors who cared for litera - ture , as they conceived it .

		It may be that I am wrong , and that they have uniformly held the com - mercial viewpoint , Avhich some of them now openly hold .

		It may be sheer idiotic idealism to contend that the editors of papers like ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' and '' The Century Magazine '' are in positions of some power , and that their position entails some responsibility both to the public and to creative genius .

		In actual working I find that there can be , apparently , no truce between any of the honest men of my generation and these magazines .

		One finds editorial ignorance , and callousness to any standards save the fashion of
1876	DATE	.

		One finds a rooted prejudice , a sheer cliff of refusal , against `` matter too unfamiliar to our readers . ''

		That phrase is used over and over again .

		A public that took as much interest in good literature as it takes in the tariff on wool , would drive out any editor who thus should set himself against all invention , all innovation , and all discovery .

		There is no culture that is not at least bilingual .

		We find an American editor -LRB- whom it would , of course , be a breach of confidence to name -RRB- who in
1912	DATE	or
1913	DATE	writes of
Henri de Regnier	PERSON	and
M. Remy de Gourmont	PERSON	as `` these young men . ''

		The rest of his sentence is to say that their work is unknown to him .

		Note that this lacuna in his mental decorations does not in the least chagrin him .

		He has no desire to add to his presumably superabundant knowledge .

		To say that the letters of a certain editor now admitted incompetent -LRB- even in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- and after long years dismissed , used to be handed about
London	LOCATION	as examples of the incredibly ridiculous , is putting it mildly .

		No , cher m.onsieur , you put it wrongly when you say the young poets seem to care whether one believe in me or in
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		You should write , they care whether or no one has considered the standards of excellence to be found in
Villon	LOCATION	and the Greek anthology ; they care whether the editors who criticize them have ever heard of Stendhal ; whether one believe that verse should be as well written as prose ; whether an author should be him - self or a mimicry .

		Anent which , take two sentences from the edito - rials of '' The Century Magazine . ''

		Note that the < !

		new editor '' of this magazine has been recom - mended to me as a `` progressive . ''

		Here are his words : '' We wish to make the fiction in this magazine come as near to truth as circumstances permit ... '' Shades of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, and of every honest creator in letters -RSB- I Second example : '' The contributors make the magazine and the magazine makes the contributors . ''

		There 's another nice chance for literature to come through the magazines .

		Has any first-class work of any sort ever been done to the specifications of a machine ?

		And a machine for pleasing the popu - lace at that I No , cher monsieur , leave my name and my per - sonal reputation out of it .

		Ask whether the younger generation wants
America	LOCATION	to produce real literature or whether they want
America	LOCATION	to con - tinue , as she is at the present moment , n joke , a byword for the ridiculous in literature , and the younger generation will answer you .

		Investigate the standards and the vitality of the standards of the `` best editorial offices , '' and see what spirit you find there .

		See whether they believe that art is , in any measure , discovery .

		See whether there is any care for good letters , even if they care enough for good letters to be in any way concerned in trying to find out what makes , and what makes for , good letters .

		Bej ` ond this it seems to me that you make a mis - take in dubbing Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, for instance , an European .

		A deal of his work is about American subjects .

		Is a man less a citizen because he cares enough for letters to leave a country where the practice of them is , or at least seems , well-nigh impossible , in order that he may bequeath a heri - tage of good letters , even to the nation which has borne him ?

		It is not that the younger generation has not tried to exist '' at home . ''

		It is that after years of struggle , one by one , they come abroad , or send their manuscripts abroad for recognition ; that they find themselves in the pages even of the '' stolid and pre - Victorian ' Quarterly ' '' before `` hustling and modern
America	LOCATION	'' has arrived at tolerance for their modernity .

		This is American reasoning right enough .

		If an accomplishment can not be converted into dollars and cents , it seems to us a useless possession .

Jan. 16	DATE	SOME LESS AUTOCRATIC ASPECTS OF `` CzAR '' REED .

		* It is twelve years since
Thomas B. Reed	PERSON	's sudden and too-early death , and a few years more since he ceased , by his own choice , to be a conspicuous figure in our national govern - ment ; but popular interest in his decidedly original yet typically American personality is still strong enough to ensure a welcome to Mr.
Samuel W. McCall	PERSON	's biography of the man , which has just appeared under the sanction and with the cooperation of sur - viving members of the
Reed	ORGANIZATION	family .

		Mr.
McCall	PERSON	's twenty years in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the
Maine	LOCATION	statesman 's term of service in the same legislative body overlapped by six years ; the two represented the same political party and had much in common in their political views and their high ideals of national policy ; and therefore the younger is by no means unqualified to give a genuinely appreciative account of the other 's achievements in public life .

		It is this public rather than the more personal and private side of Mr.
Reed	PERSON	that receives especial attention in the book , and such a survey naturally involves some discus - sion of the more important political questions with which he was concerned , though the biographer has shown commendable restraint in subordinating his own opinions to the presentation of those held by the subject of his biography .

		Reed 's large and richly endowed nature had qualities that remind us now of one and now of another illustrious character of his own or of an earlier time .

		In Yankee shrewd - ness , the apt use of homely illustration , readi - ness with a timely Biblical phrase or allusion , and , with it all , a sturdy advocacy of fair play , he was not unlike
Lincoln	LOCATION	, whom he was fond of quoting , on occasion , as when , in argu - ing against our Philippine policy , he cited
Lincoln	PERSON	's `` government of the people , by the people , for the people . ''

		Like Lincoln , he first made his mark as a country lawyer , and he sat in his state legislature before passing to a more honored seat in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like Lincoln , too , he served his country in time of war though it was in the navy , as acting assistant paymaster on board a gunboat , not in a land campaign against the Indians and he likewise indulged in subsequent humorous reference to his martial exploits .

		In certain other aspects , not those of the statesman , he irresistibly suggests Mark * THE LIFE OF

		He had Mr.

		`` She became his best critic , whose judgment he sought and followed , ' ' says his biographer .

		`` It was his habit to rehearse to her what - ever he wrote or proposed to speak upon important occasions .

		Among his unpublished manuscripts is one , brilliant but rather de - nunciatory in tone , which bears upon it the note in his handwriting , ` Not published , by order of madam . ' '

		How many a

Clemens	PERSON	!

		Curiously alike , also , the two men seem to have been in some of those minor preferences that betray character .

		Mark

		Reed 's relish for certain characteristic quali - ties in

Tom	PERSON	was evident .

		A paper prepared by him on `` Our Cat '' -LRB-
Anthony	PERSON	, originally called Cleopatra , until it was dis - covered that this name was inappropriate -RRB- has passages that might have been written by his illustrious contemporary .

		Like the au - thor of `` The Innocents Abroad , ''
Reed	PERSON	was `` an indefatigable sightseer , '' with a lively interest in foreign lands and a zest for for - eign travel .

		On one occasion at least the two men enjoyed an extended cruise in each other 's company in domestic waters , at the invitation of their common friend ,
H. H. Rogers	PERSON	, owner of the yacht ' ' Kanawha . ' '

		For details see Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's biography of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and chapter twenty-two of the book under review .

		The record of
Reed	ORGANIZATION	's college course at Bow - doin shows him to have been a good scholar without strenuous effort , and a participant in all wholesome student activities , a member of his class crew , one of the editors of the college paper , active in a local chess club , and mighty in debate , being one of the leading spirits in the
Bowdoin Debating Club	ORGANIZATION	as well as a prominent member of the
Peucinian Society	ORGANIZATION	, where this form of intellectual athletics was cultivated .

		Thrown partly upon his own resources for the payment of his college bills , he used to teach district school in the winter vacation , as was then the approved custom of impecunious and ambitious collegians .

		But even with the best of will to make his way through and win his diploma , he found him - self so nearly stranded toward the end of his senior year that he had accepted the necessity of leaving college without a degree when assistance was offered by ``
William Pitt Fes	PERSON	- senden , father of
Reed	ORGANIZATION	's room-mate , and gratefully accepted .

		This timely provision of

		School-teaching , law-study , and naval service filled the first few years after his graduation , but in
1865	DATE	he established himself in his native city of
Portland	LOCATION	as a practising lawyer , and
less than three years later	DATE	entered upon that course of political activity which was destined to extend nearly to the end of his life .

		Successively repre - sentative in the
Maine	LOCATION	legislature , senator in the same body , and attorney-general , he re - ceived the nomination and election to Con - gress from his district in
1876	DATE	, and continued to represent that district until
1899	DATE	.

		when the action of the administration in taking on the `` last colonial curse of
Spain	LOCATION	'' found him so little in sympathy with so un-American a course that he resigned his seat and retired to private life .

		Referring to the proposed plan of subjugating the Filipinos , he said to his trusted friend and secretary , Mr.
Asher C. Hinds	PERSON	: `` I have tried , perhaps not always unsuccessfully , to make the acts of my public life accord with my conscience , and I can not now do this thing . ''

		This , too , when he had just been re-elected by the customary over - whelming majority to the succeeding Con - gress , and was sure of a renewal of the speak - ership , an office of which he had once declared that it had but one superior and no peer .

		That one superior , of course , was the presi - dency , to which he came near being nominated by the convention that finally gave its vote to
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	in
1896	DATE	.

		Without following more in detail the rise of
Reed	ORGANIZATION	from a position of local to one of national if not worldwide fame , let us add a few characteristic utterances of his , as re - corded by his faithful biographer , and thus fix in mind more clearly what manner of man he was in his thought and word and action .

		From an address delivered at
Portland	LOCATION	in his earlier life , we select , partly for the benefit of young college graduates , the following : '' Perhaps the most useless piece of furniture on the footstool for the first two or three years is the college graduate , whose scholarship was a comfort to the professors and an annoyance to his com - petitors .

		These years are a worry to the scholar himself .

		He has to take all that time to get right with the world , to find the other standards by which he must measure his efforts , and to realize the nothingness of the honors he has won . ''

		To about the same period , or to one a little earlier , belongs a vigorous assertion of his religious beliefs and disbeliefs , addressed to the pastor of his church in
Portland	LOCATION	.

		There is something rather refreshing in such pas - sages as this , for example : '' I do not believe in an
Atonement	LOCATION	, because I can not see its necessity .

		The whole idea strikes me as artificial .

		If all our sins and their effects are to be washed away by vicarious suffering and we are to find ourselves pure and perfect when we touch the other shore , the problem of ` Recognition in Heaven ' is going to be terribly complicated .

		It is needless perhaps to say that I am not persuaded of the ` fall of man ' j and as for that apotheosis of lounging , the life in the Garden of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, I believe in it as little as I do in the
Saturnia Regna	LOCATION	.

		If that
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	had ever existed and man had grown up in it , it would have been merely a Paradise of fools .

		It is only by fighting the devil that we ever get to be anything . ''

		In an address on the tariff question , given at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1884	DATE	, occurs a passage in somewhat the same tone as the foregoing , which is separated from it by twenty-one years in time . ''

		The forces of evil are as continuous and deter - mined as the forces of right , and I am sorry to say that right is only right by a very small majority that has got to be kept up every day .

		This world is one where we can not always have our own way .

		There have been times when I have not been able to have mine .

		Therefore a good many men that I would have liked to punish are still flourishing upon the earth .

		Life is a perpetual source of dis - appointment .

		You can never do what you would like to do .

		You have always to do the best thing you can do . ''

		Among
Reed	PERSON	's papers after his death was found one on the subject of Imperialism , ap - parently written , says Mr.
McCall	PERSON	, during the negotiation of the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	and while
McKinley	PERSON	was touring the West and deliver - ing orations on `` Destiny . ''

		Here is a frag - ment of that paper : '' Human selfishness pervades all human life .

		It is the mainspring of human action .

		Any man 's selfishness would wreck all his surroundings were it not for the antidote , which is the selfishness of all the rest .

		Therefore if men are to be justly governed they must participate in government .

		Do I mean to say that all men are of equal power ?

		No , they can not be .

		But give every man equal rights , and intellect and wisdom will justify them - selves by persuading where they have no power to command . ''

		A good , what may even be called a breath - ing , likeness of one eminent statesman by another is offered to the fortunate reader of this book .

		A more `` intimate '' biography will perhaps some day be prepared by another hand ; but meanwhile we are grateful for this excellent presentation of the eminent Speaker .

		not be admonished too strongly to use the books of the past ten years liberally and those of the past three months sparingly .

		There is an opportunity for some one to write a substantial book in which shall be traced the origins and development of the spirit of militarism in modern
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Until this task shall have been performed , per - sons interested in this subject will be obliged to search out the information they desire in masses of documents , and especially in the vol - uminous writings of great German militarists of the type of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	and
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	.

		Al - ready the stimulation of interest in the subject has been considerable ; and to meet the de - mand for information which has arisen , enter - prising publishers have put on the market a number of books consisting of translated pas - sages from the writings of Treitschke .

		Of two at present on the reviewer 's desk , the lesser in size and importance is `` Selections from
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's Lectures on Politics , '' translated by Mr.
Adam L. Gowans	PERSON	.

		The selections here given have the merit of following the original very closely , and they cover a range of topics sufficiently representative to enable the hur - ried reader to obtain from them a very fair idea of the trend of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		More important , however , because fuller and accompanied by an extended study of Treit - schke 's life and work , is
Hausrath	LOCATION	's `` Treit - schke : His Doctrine of
Imperial Destiny	ORGANIZATION	and of International Relations . ''

		The extracts here given relate exclusively to military and international affairs , and , being fairly copious , they serve very well to exhibit the great apostle of Pan-Germanism at his best .

		Haus - rath was an intimate friend of Treitschke , and his biographical sketch has the advantages and disadvantages which may be expected to arise from such authorship .

		He depicts with marked success the colorful personality of his hero and incidentally gives a very good ac - count of the life of German university pro- fessors a generation ago .

		But his enthusiasm for his subject leads to an estimate of Treit - schke 's scholarship which is hardly borne out at every point by the facts .

		Of the making of books about the
Kaiser	PERSON	there is no end .

		One of the many issued in recent weeks bears the title ' ' The Real Kaiser : An Illuminating Study '' and has been pub - lished anonymously , first in
England	LOCATION	and sub - sequently in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We are told that the author has had exceptional oppor - tunities to study his subject at close quarters .

		This may be true ; and it can not be denied that here and there he has a shrewd inter - pretation and employs telling phrases .

		He relates a number of episodes that have not THE DIAL 45 hitherto reached English readers .

		But inaccu - racies are numerous , notably in the chapter in which an attempt is made to describe the structure and operation of the imperial gov - ernmental system ; and the book is further marred by an occasional unnecessary expres - sion of anti-German sentiment .

		A better piece of work is Mr.
George Saun	PERSON	- ders 's ' ' Builder and Blunderer . ' '

		The author of this book was for many years
Berlin	LOCATION	corre - spondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Morning Post '' and of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' and his opportunity to go behind the scenes was without doubt exceptional .

		The book opens with a reason - ably accurate description of the German posi - tion at the
Kaiser	PERSON	's accession , and of the events attending the accession ; but the major portion of it is devoted to an analysis of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's foreign policy and of his `` German world - policy . ''

		It is maintained that , despite con - trary appearances which deceived many , the
Kaiser	PERSON	has been at all times since his accession the principal menace to the peace of the world , and in substantiation of the view a long chain of incidents in the diplomatic and political history of the past quarter-century is re - counted .

		The world , it is affirmed , has been supremely disappointed in the development of a character which originally seemed uncom - monly promising .

		Only a few days before the outbreak of the present war there was published in
Germany	LOCATION	a book written by Colonel Frobenius and bear - ing a title which may be translated as `` The German Empire 's Hour of Destiny . ''

		The book won the unreserved praise of the German Crown Prince , and of the Prussian militarists generally .

		The author took as the basis of his work a book written a few years ago by an American student of politics , namely Mr.
Homer Lea	PERSON	's `` The Day of the Saxon . ''

		In this volume Mr.
Lea	PERSON	pictured the dangers which threatened the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	, arising from its decline in fitness for war , - coupled with the growing ascendancy and lordliness of
Germany	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	was con - ceived to be the most dangerous opponent , and the somewhat fantastic idea was exploited that
England	LOCATION	's original mistake lay in her permit - ting the unification of
Germany	LOCATION	to take place .

		Mr.
Lea	PERSON	's practical proposition was that
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	should create an adequate army and proceed to the annihilation of her chief con - tinental rival .

		Colonel Frobenius similarly maintained that a titanic conflict between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	was inevitable , and he placed at the head of his first chapter the statement that `` the British world empire can be saved only by
Germany	LOCATION	's overthrow , '' the inference being that
Britain	LOCATION	's natural pol - icy would be the subversion of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It was his opinion , however , that the British would see the expediency of sparing the Ger - man army , to the end that
Russia	LOCATION	might be held in bounds , and that the conflict between
Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	would be exclusively , or at least primarily , naval .

		British troops might be expected to operate on land only for the purpose of driving the German warships from protected ports to the open sea where they could be engaged by British vessels .

		That war with both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	was coming was expressly predicted .

		Indeed , one chapter was written to demonstrate that as a military measure
France	LOCATION	must declare war against
Germany	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	or
1916	DATE	, and another to show that the hour of the German Empire and its allies might come as early as the
spring of 1915	DATE	.

		That the conflict had not broken much earlier , that `` so favorable an oppor - tunity as the war in the
Balkans	LOCATION	did not fire the powder , '' and that it was only
England	LOCATION	who held back her threatening allies , was attributed principally to the `` cold-blooded British commercial spirit . ' '

		There is nowhere in print not even in General von
Bern	LOCATION	- hardi 's writings a more frank and forceful statement of the point of view taken by the German authorities in the present conflict .

		In the
autumn of 1913	DATE	one of the editors of the
Paris	LOCATION	' ' Figaro , ' '
M. Georges Bourdon	PERSON	, paid a visit to
Germany	LOCATION	with the express purpose of ascertaining the actual sentiment of repre - sentative Germans toward the French govern - ment and people .

		Interviews were held with high officials , party leaders , university profes - sors , literary men , and representatives of mili - tary and patriotic organizations , and the re - sults were published in a series of articles in `` Figaro . ''

		In English translation , these arti - cles , with additions , have lately been brought out in
London	LOCATION	in book form under the title ' ' The German Enigma . ' '


M. Bourdon	PERSON	tells us that on his departure for
Germany	LOCATION	he made a determined effort to shake off all his precon - ceived opinions , and he confesses freely that his experiences showed him the error of some of the opinions which , in common with other Frenchmen , he had cherished .

		`` We know nothing of
Germany	LOCATION	, '' he exclaims , `` neither does she know anything of us . ''

		Few books are written with loftier purpose , and it must be said that the spirit of fairness and of altru - ism with which the author begins is sustained to the end .

		The result is an objective , impar - tial , and impersonal study .

		In only the last chapter does the author obtrude his private views and seek to draw conclusions .

		His great objective is an eloquent , although restrained , plea for a Franco-German rapprochement on THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	the basis of continued German possession of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	and the engagement of the
Berlin	LOCATION	authorities to govern the Alsatians as a free , rather than a subjugated , people .

		Such a solution , it was maintained , would involve no sacrifice of pride or of dignity by either nation , yet it would heal a festering wound and would deliver the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	from the crushing burden of military expenditure .

		The picture drawn was roseate , but events have proved it only a fleeting vision .

		The book is of interest because it was written from a viewpoint seldom assumed in recent years by European publicists .

		In '' What
Germany	LOCATION	Wants '' Dr.
Edmund von Mach	PERSON	has undertaken to supply a con - servative answer to a query which in these days is on every one 's lips .

		Dr. von
Mach	ORGANIZATION	is an American and a graduate of
Harvard	LOCATION	, al - though of Prussian birth and , in the main , of Prussian training .

		He knows his
America	LOCATION	rather better than do certain other German apologists in this country , and the temperate - ness of his arguments ought to ensure his book a wide and thoughtful reading .

		The essential desire of
Germany	LOCATION	he defines as follows : ''
Germany	LOCATION	wants to keep the confines of her home-land inviolate , but is not desirous of joining to them new lands of unwilling people .

		She wants to develop her colonies and invest her money in the building of extra-territorial railways which will ultimately bring her into relation with new mar - kets .

		She wants to develop her home commerce and industry , and increase the usefulness of her agriculture that she may give employment to a population growing at the rate of about a million a year ... Over and above these desires she has the very natural and proper ambition to be worthy of her great past and to make her own contribu - tions to the civilization of the world .

		She wants social justice , and she wishes to remove from her laboring classes the ills of poverty .


Germany	LOCATION	wants peace , for in peace only can she do what she has set out to do .

		She wants an honorable and a stable peace , and in so far as the defects of her character have been contributory causes to misunderstand - ings she wishes to eradicate these defects .

		She desires the good will of the world . ''

		A convenient handbook for Americans who wish to follow the course of the war intelli - gently is Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	's `` The War in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		This book falls into two parts .

		The first is devoted to a crisp description of the general international situa - tion in
Europe	LOCATION	on the eve of the war .

		The second contains an account of the outbreak of the war , with chapters on the psychology of the war , the question of neutrality , modern methods of warfare , the effect of the war on the
United States	LOCATION	, and the possible terms of peace .

		Evidence which has come to light since the date of publication would probably cause the author to give some of his statements to - day a different turn , but of course this was inevitable , and on the whole the book remains a very fair and substantially accurate piece of work .

		Eminently sensible are the suggestions which are offered concerning the necessary basis of a true and final peace .

		Stated briefly , they are : -LRB- 1 -RRB-
Europe	LOCATION	must recognize the blood kinship of people of the same race , and must cease trying to destroy the language and traditions of race groups ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- She must give up the idea of compelling large racial units to accept a government which is hateful to them ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- A larger portion of the people must be admitted to a share in decisions as to their own destiny ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- No peace can be durable that does not provide in some way against the causes which have brought about the present war , chief among them being the feeling , fos - tered by great armaments , that war is a proper and manly way of settling national differ - ences ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- War can be prevented only by some sort of world federation in which every nation shall have an armed force upon a fixed proportion , to be used as part of a contingent of a world police .

		It is just conceivable that the war may go on undecisively until the nations , from sheer exhaustion , shall become willing to terminate hostilities and to restore , as nearly as possible , the conditions of
July , 1914	DATE	.

		But it is much more likely that one side or the other will be definitely victorious , and in this event the map of
Europe	LOCATION	will undoubtedly have to be re - made .

		Dr.
Herbert A. Gibbons	PERSON	's `` The New Map of
Europe	LOCATION	'' was written in part before the outbreak of the war .

		But chapters were appended after the war began , and nowhere in English will one find as yet a fuller or better discussion of the political and geographical changes which the war is capable of pro- ducing .

		Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	has been for some years a member of the faculty of
Roberts College	ORGANIZATION	,
Constantinople	LOCATION	, and he has had varied oppor - tunity to acquaint himself with the political and military affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	, especially of
Europe	LOCATION	east of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	.

		His present chapters cover a wide range from the pass - ing of
Persia	LOCATION	and the problem of the
Bagdad	LOCATION	railway in the east to
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	and
Luxemburg	LOCATION	in the west .

		The best are the half-dozen or more recounting the military and political happenings of southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	since the Turkish revolution of
1908	DATE	.

		for the author has been an observer of , and even a participant in , many of the events of which he here writes .

		In his discussion of the present conflict Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	takes the ground that
Germany	LOCATION	forced war on
Russia	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, that German ambition has long been
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 47 a menace to all
Europe	LOCATION	, that
Great Britain	LOCATION	was fully justified in entering the contest , and that the violation of the neutrality of Bel - gium was not the cause , but only the occasion , of British participation .

		The only way in which war could have been avoided last Au - gust , we are told , would have been `` to allow
Germany	LOCATION	to make , according to her own de - sires and ambitions , the new map of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		PLAYS OF TO-DAY AXD YESTERDAY .

		* If we compare the publishers ' lists of to - day with those of fifteen or even ten years ago , it is surprising to see how many more plays are now getting into print .

		And these are not only plays which have been or might be successfully acted ; many of them are in - tended merely to be read , and could not be staged with any hope of interesting an audi - ence .

		Not only does the printed play serve as a platform , or at least a soapbox , for peo - ple who have a social or political message to deliver to the world ; it has been seized upon even by the lyric poets as a medium for the expression of personal emotion .

		Thus we find in our list not only Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	preaching pacificism , Mr.
Francis	PERSON	preaching syndical - ism , and M. Andreyev preaching nihilism , but Mr.
Eobinson	PERSON	and Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	translating their favorite types of lyric , the puzzle lyric and the mystical lyric , into what purports to be dramatic form .

		It is perhaps our misfortune that we live in an age when nothing can be taken for granted .

		Of course our field of speculation is considerably widened ; but this is a poor com - pensation for the artistic formlessness and poverty which the dissolution of tradition involves .

		We may smile at the simple-mind - edness of Aristotle , who thought a play was an imitation of action , or of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, who thought a playwright ought to hold a * THE UNSEEN EMPIRE .

		mirror up to nature .

		But the out-of-date dramatists who were expected to give pleasure by imitating human life in a manner presenta - ble on the stage had an immense advantage in knowing what was expected of them , and in general how they were expected to do it .

		Whether the modern dramatists , unguided by a tradition in these respects , will succeed in working out a satisfactory artistic form , is a hard question .

		There is no doubt that the drama , which had been slumbering in a sort of coma of conventionality , has been vitalized through the widening of its scope ; and though many of the playwrights seem to struggle vainly with their material , though their utterance is stammering and eccentric , most of them have something to say and are striving toward a comprehensible form .

		Events have made a cruelly sardonic com - ment on the rather saccharine optimism of ' The Unseen Empire . ''

		The youthful hero - ine ,
Friderika Stahl	PERSON	, has been left sole owner of the Stahl Gun Works , the great manufac - turing centre of war material in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Absorbed in philanthropic projects among her workmen , she has never realized the mean - ing of the vast establishment built up by her father .

		Her eyes are opened through the attempts of the Emperor to gain more direct control of the works , first by marrying her to a prince , then , when this fails and war is imminent , by forcibly seizing the plant .

		She defeats the second plan by the help of her chief electrician , who is also her lover .

		The result is that the Emperor , who , it appears , has always objected to war , heads a movement for a federation of
Europe	LOCATION	, and bestows the Order of the
Red Eagle	ORGANIZATION	on the young man who thwarted the war plans .

		The lightning change of Emperor and Chancellor from lion to lamb would be merely comic if history had not made it into a bitter caricature of pacifi - cist dreams .

		Mr.
Francis	PERSON	's `` Change '' has for its theme the tragic clash of the new and the old in a Welsh mining village .

		In
1911	DATE	it won a prize offered for the best play by a Welsh author dealing with life in
Wales	LOCATION	.

		As is often the case with prize plays and stories , it is sincere , respectable , and rather dull .

		The action moves very slowly ; there are three or four moderately interesting characters , but none of compelling interest ; the play lacks focus .

		The writer seems to have been more inter - ested in a social condition than in any of his characters ; and this is to say that as a dra - matist he has failed .

		It is not hard to see why the play , to quote the Introduction , `` met with a most deplorable and undeserved re - ception ' ' in
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	With a somewhat similar setting the mining region of Derbyshire Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	has written a vastly better play .

		In `` The Widowing of Mrs.
Holroyd	PERSON	'' he has no social theories to expound , but he is pro- foundly interested in Mrs.
Holroyd	PERSON	, her chil - dren , her drunken husband , and her sober and hard-working lover ,
Blackmore	PERSON	.

		A de - cent woman with ideals of her own , she at first gives
Blackmore	PERSON	no encouragement ; but things come to such a pass that she finally consents to run away with him , taking her two children .

		Then comes an accident in the mine , in which her husband is killed .

		A revulsion of feeling sweeps over her ; her early love for him returns , and with his old mother she weeps passionately over his body .

		The final scene , grimly realistic and of extraor - dinary power , shows the two women wash - ing the body for burial .

		The best evidence of the author 's tact and skill is that the effect neither of this scene nor of the play as a whole is sordid or depressing ; it is rather , in the true sense of the word , tragic .

		The fault of the play is its inconclusiveness , which would handicap it on the stage ; but , from the read - er 's point of view , this is more than redeemed by keen insight into character and firm grasp of situation .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	is still a very young man ; he will be well worth watching .

		From a first-hand study of life we turn to a literary echo .

		Mr.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	's `` And So They Were Married '' may be best described as an American imitation of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays .

		Surely a man of genius should pray thrice daily to be delivered from his imitators .

		They are sure to `` show him up , '' magnifying his faults and weaknesses till the public turns from him in disgust .

		No hostile criticism can be half so damaging as the imitation of the faithful disciple .

		The reac - tion against Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	was bound to come ; and the appearance of a follower like Mr.
Williams	PERSON	suggests that it is upon us .

		His heroine well knows that by the law of her nature she must compel the man with whom she is in love to propose to her ; she struggles bravely against it , and when in spite of her - self she has most obviously forced him into a declaration , she says , `` in an awed whisper , stepping back slowly , ' I 've done it !

		I 've done it !

		I knetv I 'd do it ! ' '

		But of course she will not let a poor scientific man ruin his prospects by marrying her .

		They will `` belong to each other '' without marriage , and this she announces to her assembled and astounded relatives .

		To do her lover justice , it must be said that at first he objects to this programme ; but the ' '
Life Force	ORGANIZATION	' ' has got hold of him too ; and besides , in defending
Helen	PERSON	from her incensed family , he has to defend her plan .

		A clever old uncle who is a judge , taking unfair advantage of their excitement and of the easy-going law of the state , mar - ries them on the spot in spite of their teeth ; but at the same time he warns Society - that a general overhauling is inevitable .

		Various minor characters and incidents make it too plain that Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is not intentionally writing burlesque .

		As the reader begins to turn the pages of Mr.
Edwin Arlington Robinson	PERSON	's `` Van
Zorn	PERSON	, '' various questions rise in his mind .

		Who is Van
Zorn	PERSON	?

		Who is
Villa Vannevar	ORGANIZATION	, the heroine ?

		What have been their past rela - tions with each other ?

		with
George Lucas	PERSON	?

		with
Farnham	ORGANIZATION	?

		There is no exposition to gratify his curiosity ; but he consoles himself with the thought that as he goes on these matters will become clear .

		On the contrary , he becomes more and more bewildered .

		There is a good deal of more or less clever dialogue ; there develops a kind of emotional tension , involving the transference of the heroine 's affections ; but Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	keeps his secrets , or reveals them only in riddles .

		The reader 's curiosity is teased very much as it is in some of Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's poems .

		He feels that if he could learn something about these people they might prove to be interest - ing .

		But perhaps after all they are not peo - ple ; perhaps they are symbols .

		The play will be a good subject for some future doc - tor 's thesis ; until that appears it will be safe to reserve our judgment .

		Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	's `` King of the Dark Chamber '' is frankly symbolical ; the characters could by no possibility be mistaken for real per - sons .

		Lecturers who expound the beauties of Tagore before women 's clubs will probably have no difficulty in explaining that the play is an allegory of the conquest of the soul -LRB- the Queen -RRB- by Love -LRB- the King -RRB- , with the help of Humility -LRB- Surangama -RRB- , and the discomfiture of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's chief rival , Practical Sagacity or Efficiency -LRB-
Kanchi	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The symbolism is rather clearer than is usual in
Maeterlinck	LOCATION	; the style is noticeably reminiscent of his .

		There is a good deal of the material of poetry floating around in a rather nebulous state , and there are some pretty lyrics , one , for in - stance , beginning : '' Open your door .

		I am waiting .

		The ferry of the light from the dawn to the dark is done for the day .

		The evening star is up . ''

		It is in a way refreshing to turn to the `` Three Modern Plays from the French . ''

		Here is no recondite or symbolical meaning , no prophet or lyricist disguised as a play -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 49 wright .

		`` We go back with a certain sense of relief to the good old triangle .

		It encloses nothing of extraordinary interest , but at least we know what to expect .

		It is odd to see how these plays , produced in
1892	DATE	,
1896	DATE	, and
1902	DATE	, already sound like voices from a past generation .

		Heavens !

		they seem written merely to entertain !

		In
M. Lavedan	PERSON	's `` Prince D'Aurec '' the chief interest is in the husband , a fine type of the useless and orna - mental French nobleman .


Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	's `` The Pardon '' is remarkable as a tour de force .

		The triangle , if I may mix the mathe - matical metaphors , is reduced to its lowest terms ; there are in this three-act comedy only three characters .

		As a piece of techni - cal sleight of hand it would be hard to equal .

		In
M. Donnay	PERSON	's `` The Other Danger '' inter - est centres in the woman who has a lover with whom her innocent daughter falls desperately in love .

		If we take the situation seriously , as
M. Donnay	PERSON	wishes us to , we can hardly be satisfied with his solution .

		Mme.
Jadain	PERSON	heroically resigns her lover , commanding him to marry
Madeleine	PERSON	, and he , though he pro- tests a good deal , seems not indisposed to consent .

		It must be a grim humorist indeed who could find anything amusing in the two plays of M. Leonid Andreyev published in the ' ' Modern Drama Series . ''

		In ''
Savva	PERSON	' ' we find ourselves in the company of a group of luna - tics and idiots .

		Considerable ingenuity is shown in distinguishing various types of men - tal alienation ; thus we have the drunken idiot , the playful idiot , the maniac who has committed the unpardonable sin , and the mild melancholiac .

		There is only one really sane person in the play .

		The hero is a young nihilist who wishes to destroy every mark and sign of civilization and the past , literature , art , cities , even clothes , so that the human race may begin over again au naturel .

		If they then show any signs of relapsing into anything resembling our present civilization , he plans to massacre them all .

		Very appro - priately he is torn to pieces by a mob ; but it is evident that
M. Andreyev	PERSON	regards him as a martyr .

		`` The Life of Man , '' published in the same year as ' ' Sawa , '' is a far more note - worthy performance .

		It is a sort of morality play , in a prologue and five scenes .

		If the philosophy of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's novels were to be summed up in a short dramatic allegory , the result would be something like `` The Life of Man . ''

		The characters are Man , his Wife , Father , Relatives , Neighbors , Friends , Enemies , etc. .

		Interspersed with the dialogue are long choral passages uttered by groups of people speaking individually but indistinguishably , and headed merely `` The Drunkards ' Conversation , '' or `` The Old Women 's Conversation . ''

		In the form of familiar talk , these passages often furnish the most poignant comment on the action where they seem most irrelevant or frivolous .

		Speaking the prologue , and dominating the whole piece , is the dread figure , `` Someone in Gray called He . ''

		He is present in the back - ground of every scene , holding in his hand the candle which burns gradually lower .

		He listens with equal apathy to the rejoicing of Man and his Wife over their first success , to their agonizing prayers for the life of their child , and to Man 's curses when the child dies .

		He is a God of stone .

		It is interesting to compare this twentieth - century morality with a morality of the fif - teenth century .

		The message of `` Every - man '' is that the soul of man is a thing of infinite value , and that man 's life on earth has infinite significance .

		The message of ' ' The Life of Man ' ' is that the soul of man is a trivial toy , and that man 's life is infinitely meaningless .

		The fifteenth-century play is filled with a sense of the reality of the past , of the reality of the future , and of the cru - ciality of the present that divides them .

		In the twentieth-century play all are alike empty and unreal .

		To turn from these powerful and melan - choly productions is like coming out from an asylum or an operating-room .

		The sec - ond of the ' ' Half Hours , '' '' The Twelve-pound Look , '' is a portrait of an egoist considerably less refined than

		In intro - ducing him , the author politely but unkindly says , `` If quite convenient -LRB- as they say about cheques -RRB- you are to conceive that the scene is laid in your own house , and that

		No doubt Harry would be glad to be you or anyone else before his interview with

Kate	PERSON	is his former wife , now a `` new woman , '' but not of the type familiar in the new drama .

		Perhaps it would not be a bad guess that Sir

		The last of the `` Half Hours , '' `` The Will , '' is a bit of the tragedy of life as it appears in a lawyer 's office .

Philip Ross	PERSON	's experience is not so very different from that of
M. Andreyev	PERSON	's `` Man '' ; yet in total effect the two plays are as wide asunder as the poles .

		In the back - ground of the `` Life of Man '' there are only spectres gibbering and flitting through vacancy , and the blank and stony stare of the insane God .

		In the background of `` The Will '' is the whole huge and various earth , with its forces of good and evil , and its rich - ness of real human sorrow and joy .

		It is interesting to speculate as to what would be the effect upon
M. Andreyev	PERSON	if he could look out upon everyday life for an instant through Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	's eyes .

		If he survived the shock , he would probably suppose , depending on his early training , that he had been trans - ported either to fairyland or to heaven .

		Later he would reason that he must have been sub - ject to a hallucination .

		Yet the result of such a glimpse , even on a logical and unhumorous mind , would surely be enlightening .

		has more problems to solve , and more pres - sures to equilibrate or perhaps to resist .

		If things go on as they have been going , he will have more adjustments to make next year than he has this year .

		Even in the school , which was originally a place of quiet for the purpose of encouraging reflective attitudes , there is constantly increasing tension because there are more subjects to study and tasks to per - form each succeeding year .

		The demands upon the schools have already become so numerous and burdensome that the chief problem discussed to-day in educational meet - ings is the pruning of the curriculum so that pupils will not be crowded so hard .

		Think of the number of things which a fam - ily even in modest circumstances must buy to-day in order to keep pace with their neigh - bors !

		Think of the ' ' amusements ' ' they must patronize , the books and periodicals they must read , the ' ' functions ' ' they must attend !

		And then consider especially the burdens imposed upon those who are on the firing-line , and must furnish the funds for all this unrest and striving and struggle !

		The above reflections are incited by reading the books under review .

		In purpose and gen - eral point of view they resemble other books that have appeared in
America	LOCATION	during the past decade .

		It is probable , however , that Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	's `` Worry and Nervousness '' is the most important and attractive contribution that has yet been made to the discussion of this subject .

		It is the work of a scientist , to begin with ; and its thoroughgoing presenta - tion of all aspects of nervous disturbances that give rise to worry and that are the out - growth thereof is based upon an accurate knowledge of the physical and mental laws involved .

		A number of recent writers upon this subject have approached it from the standpoint of religion Mr.
Carey	PERSON	's `` New Nerves for Old '' is written from this point of view or hypnotism or morbid psychology ; but Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	writes as a physician , and con - sequently one feels that his analysis and sug - gestions for the treatment of worry are a little more securely grounded than are most of the expressions on these topics which one hears or reads to-day .

		`` Worry and Nervousness '' discusses every phase of nervousness and its hygiene and !

		treatment ; and the discussion throughout is presented in a clear , graceful style .

		The varied forms of nervousness are classified under seven heads : -LRB- 1 -RRB- chronic fear , or worry , -LRB- 2 -RRB- neurasthenoidia , or near-neuras - thenia , -LRB- 3 -RRB- neurasthenia , or nervous exhaus - tion , -LRB- 4 -RRB- psychasthenia , or true brain fag , -LRB- 5 -RRB- hysteria , the master imitator , -LRB- 6 -RRB- hypo -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL .

		51 chondria , or chronic blues , -LRB- 7 -RRB- simple melan - cholia .

		Each of these types of nervousness is analyzed , and their relations toward one another pointed out .

		The largest general con - clusion to be derived from these analyses is that under the stress and strain of modern life , alike in the case of the worker and the social `` climber , '' the vitality of the nervous system is lowered , and there follows a host of troubles , all springing out of or giving rise to fear or w r orry .

		Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	cites a large num - ber of concrete examples of the various fears he describes , and they are very numerous .

		Modern students of this subject have had to develop an extensive vocabulary to describe the fears which have been differentiated out of the common attitude of worry or dread .

		There is `` aerophobia , '' the dread of fresh air , especially night air ; `` aichmophobia , '' the dread of pointed tools ; `` kenophobia , '' the fear of emptiness ; '' brontophobia , '' the fear of thunder ; `` acrophobia , '' the fear of high places ; ' ' agoraphobia , ' ' the fear of open spaces ; `` misophobia , '' the fear of dirt ; `` pathophobia , '' the fear of disease ; `` zoopho - bia , ' ' the fear of animals , and so on ad libitum .

		Then there are nervous states which are not quite of the nature of dread or fear , but which nevertheless give rise to the worrying attitude , such as the magnification of trifles , worrying about the weather , the chronic `` kicking '' habit , and so on through a long list .

		And what is the cause of all these abnormali - ties ?

		In some cases , lowered vitality ; in other cases , strain and stress in maintaining existence ; but in most cases in American life it is the struggle for more and more things and experiences .

		The results are social mal - adjustments which produce sooner or later nervous irregularities and mental strains and crises .

		Through twenty interesting chapters , the author analyzes and describes typical everyday types of worry and fear and nervousness , and he gives concrete examples of every type .

		He also presents diagrams giving the results of modern research on the relations between bodily states and nervous and mental reactions .

		He drives home some of his principles by presenting photographic and pictorial illustrations of fear , worry , and especially of `` going the pace '' in American life .

		But what can be done about it all ?

		Part II .

		of `` Worry and Nervousness '' is devoted to a discussion of how these troubles may be alle - viated .

		The sum of the whole thing is : let the neurasthenic reduce his wants .

		Let him give up thinking about himself , and become interested in some other person , or some cause of an impersonal character .

		But fundamen - tally he must live a simple , hygienic life .

		He must cut out every form of stimulant and narcotic .

		Alcohol , tobacco , tea , coffee , and the whole list of narcotic drinks are deadly in their effect upon the nervous system .

		Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	says that any physician who is thrown in contact with a large number of nervous cases has it borne in upon him every day that the chief enemies of the health and stability of the nervous system and the mind are the popularly used poisons , alcohol , tobacco , tea , and coffee .

		Tobacco stands foremost among the causes of increased blood pressure , which drags a whole train of evils in its course .

		Alcohol is next , and then come tea and coffee .

		The author quotes
Richardson	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	to the effect that excessive tea drinking among the women of that country has produced a sort of semi-hysterical condition .

		They try to relieve this condition by resorting to alcoholic stimulants , so that one evil intensifies thei other .

		He also quotes Dr.
Bock	PERSON	of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, who has observed the same effects among women who are addicted to the use of coffee .

		Even the use of condiments , as pepper , mus - tard , vinegar , and the like , is a source of nervous irritation and instability .

		Next to hygiene in order of therapeutic value in the treatment of nervousness and worry is faith simple , trusting faith .

		Here is the physician , looking at the whole matter from the physician 's point of view , who con - cludes that nervous health without faith , is impossible .

		Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	and Mr.
Carey	PERSON	are in agreement in respect to the value of faith in preserving healthy nerves .

		Most of `` New Nerves for Old '' is devoted to impressing this view .

		It would not do to pass over this point without quoting a paragraph from `` Worry and Nervousness '' -LRB- p. 50 -RRB- : `` All faith tendencies are toward mental happi - ness and psychical health .

		All people , good or bad , get the physical rewards of faith , regardless whether the objects of their faith and belief are true or false .

		Faith reacts favorably upon the body independent of the trueness of the object or the correctness of the thing believed .

		Faith is the natural , normal , and healthy state of mind for man .

		Faith is the state of mind that ever tends to make a man better , stronger , happier , and healthier . ''

		Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	discusses the modern use of psychotherapy and therapeutic suggestion , and indorses these means in many cases .

		He also considers educational therapeutics , the strengthening of the will , the value of recrea - tion , study , play , work , and social service .

		In particular cases these are all of great value , because they relax the tense nerves of the neurasthenic and substitute wholesome and upbuilding ideas for narrow , self-centred , 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	and hypochondriacal ones .

		Mr.
Carey	PERSON	ad - vances substantially the same views , though he does not base his principles upon physical and mental laws as Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	does .

		As a summary of all his suggestions , Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	makes self-mastery the supreme aim , which is in effect the conclusion reached by Mr.
Carey	PERSON	and most of the others who have written upon this complicated subject in recent times .

		The real secret of nervous and mental health is after all to get hold and keep hold of one 's self in the midst of all the strains and stresses of an increasingly complex life .

		The reviewer may perhaps add an opinion of his own which seems reasonable in view of the principles developed by Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	and others .

		Nervousness in all its morbid phases seems to show nature 's attempt to destroy the individual who is not living in accord with her laws physical , intellectual , social , and re - ligious .

		And in order to escape from this trouble , all remedies must come back in the end to simple , rational living first physical , then social to live in harmony and good will with one 's fellows and religious to have faith that back of the universe and sup - porting it is an all-wise and all - just power and personality .

		Most people who study human nature come to this conclusion sooner or later -

		RECENT FICTIOX .

		* The argument is sometimes made that the novelists of our day have , and can have , noth - ing really new to tell us .

		Men and women are pretty much the same everywhere , it is said , and their passions have been recorded in all their variety by the long procession of poets and dramatists and story-tellers .

		In particu - lar we are assured that we should be better off reading the great Victorians than the novel of the season , simply because they did all that any of our contemporaries can do and did it better .

		Many of us who are interested in novels give this advice lip-service by passing it on and do not follow it .

		One reason is to be found in fashion .

		To the mind which re - joices in the ``

Thackeray	PERSON	and

		eray and
Dickens	PERSON	knew very little and of which they did not always tell what they knew .

		There is one obvious retort to Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	's sneer at Thackeray because he did not dare to give
Becky Sharp	PERSON	a soul ; it is that
Becky Sharp	PERSON	exists .

		There is an equally obvious retort to the charge that
Dickens	PERSON	saw nothing in the lower classes except what was funny .

		It is that the lower classes are funny .

		The fact remains that women quite as wicked as
Becky Sharp	ORGANIZATION	have souls and that the poor are a great deal more than amusing .

		It is the fashion just now to belittle science , especially the less exact sciences .

		But science does count , even toward the novel .

		Darwin and
Karl Marx	PERSON	did not live in vain .

		Science can tell us more about the two great motives of human conduct , the erotic and the economic , than it once could ; and one of the results of the scientific method is a tremendously in - creased curiosity about the things it has only partially revealed to us .

		The merest hint of new knowledge is enough to create an active dissatisfaction with the old .

		It may be a long time before any novelist compels us to under - stand what the socialists like to call `` the working-class mind , ' ' but we can no more rest with
Dickens	PERSON	's sense of it than we can rest with
Thackeray	PERSON	's ideas about women .

		`` The Second Blooming '' is an example of a novel that could hardly have been written a generation ago .


David Graham Phillips	PERSON	a writer whose merits seem to have been hidden by his crudity from all but a few critics , like Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	dealt often with the same general theme : the futility of the lives of leisure-class women .

		But he never worked it out as subtly as Mr.
George	PERSON	has .

		The story is of three sisters , all of whom are frustrated by the lives they lead as the wives of well-to - do men .

		Grace found her only real happiness during the three years she conducted a liaison ;
Mary	PERSON	found a certain contentment in many children Clara expended most of her surplus energy in helping her husband 's political career .

		It looks as if Mr.
George	PERSON	had set out to demonstrate in fiction the feminist theory which he has previously expounded in argu - ment .

		But there is more to it than that .

		Most of his interest is in Grace , and her love for
Enoch Fenor	PERSON	.

		He tells what went on in her mind frankly , honestly , and without preaching about it ; so that while one may disapprove of Grace , or pity her , or respect her , one can neither hail Mr.
George	PERSON	as one who perceives that love justifies irregularity of conduct nor damn him as one who confuses moral values .

		There are some weak places in the story .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	has avoided telling just why it was that
Grace	ORGANIZATION	found herself out of love with her
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 husband ; it was n't , as he would have us be - lieve , just because she had nothing interesting to do and he bored her with his interest in what he had to do , which was to follow the law .

		Some of the unhappiness of these three sis - ters , more than Mr.
George	PERSON	admits , was due to that eternal disparity between the dream and the accomplishment which afflicts every hu - man being .

		But we must not quarrel with Mr.
George	PERSON	.

		He has written an excellent novel , and one much more readable than the clever one he published last year , `` The Making of an Englishman . ''

		He has done more .

		He has exhibited a kind of imagination which is too rare in English fiction , an imagi - nation that has enabled him to see -LRB- and to tell us -RRB- how it was with
Grace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Because his inter - est is always in understanding her rather in moralizing about her he succeeds in arousing our sympathy for a woman who was unable to find any better use for her courage or any more complete expression for her adventurous spirit than a brief and secret love-affair .

		To do that is as much finer as it is more difficult than merely to play upon our sense of our own vir - tue by presenting us with a properly chastised sinner .

		Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	has rounded off what we had expected was to be a trilogy with his second volume .

		`` Sinister Street '' apparently tells all that we are to know of
Michael Fane	PERSON	, whose acquaintance we made in `` Youth 's Encounter . ''

		Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	asks , in an epilogue , that we regard his volumes as the story of `` the youth of a man who pre - sumably will be a priest '' rather than `` as an idealized or debased presentation of his own existence up to the age of twenty - three . ' '

		But we can not freely grant his request , even though we do not know how much of an aesthete Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	was when he was at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		At any rate these two novels give a more complete account of the mind of a young man of our day than has been written pre - viously in English , an account which presents some of the things that
Thackeray	PERSON	meant when he complained that his public would not per - mit him to tell all he wished about Pendennis , and a good many more besides .

		For
Michael	PERSON	is of a kind of sensitiveness that would not have interested as full-blooded a man as the creator of
Colonel Newcome	ORGANIZATION	, and
Michael	PERSON	's experience with the Miss Fotheringay sort of person is very different from anything that was omitted by tacit request from
Pendennis	ORGANIZATION	's history .

		We mean to suggest that if ' ' Sinister Street '' is worth reading , and we think it is , the fact is not wholly owing to its free use of material which , as Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has put it , the Victorian novelist `` dodged . ''

		Perhaps there is no living writer who is more at home in the description of peasant and working-class life than Mr.
Martin Andersen Nexo	PERSON	, or one of a finer spirit .

		There can hardly be one who is dead , because his point of view is too new .

		But we hesitate to men - tion socialism in connection with `` Pelle the Conqueror , '' although it is mentioned once or twice in `` Apprenticeship , '' because the word is so likely to call up memories of propagan - dist novels which had no merit except their intention to improve the world .

		Perhaps Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	is not an orthodox socialist .

		One of the most illuminating and fascinating chapters in this second of the four volumes of
Pelle	PERSON	's his - tory tells of a vagabond workman , the most skilful of cobblers , who came back to the little shop where he was a legend and gave the others a glimpse of his romantic journey through the world , and of that vision which makes labor artistry .

		Would an orthodox socialist have put that passage in his novel ?

		Doubt - less anybody would have put it there who could , and the point is that Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	could .

		It may be that the half of the story which we have still to read , and which we know deals with
Pelle	PERSON	's experience as a labor-leader , will reveal the characteristic weakness of the propa - gandist , but we shall be surprised if it does .

		For so far Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	seems always the artist , the man of feeling who is bound to give us what he has lived , and only what he has lived .

Aymar Em	PERSON	- Colonicd churches , - i TT j' A. ' - L i bury II. , a distinguished prac - tising architect , attempts the history and description of the most important group of our early monuments .

		Undertaken primarily for brother-architects , it places at their disposal the richest collection of photographs of Colo - nial churches yet assembled .

		In the one hun - dred full page half-tones are illustrated the exteriors and interiors of all the existing buildings of first importance , and a repre - sentative selection of others , from the coloni - zation down to the abandonment of Georgian traditions , about
1830	DATE	.

		The text , with archi - tect , antiquarian , and general reader all in view , lacks fixity of purpose and uniformity of method .

		In general the effort is to recover the history and the successive forms of the buildings discussed , but the limits of rele - vancy in ecclesiastical episode and historical anecdote are frequently passed .

		The lack of an alphabetical index is a serious hindrance ; frequent misprints and slips in the spelling of 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	proper names force the reader to be on his guard .

		The author shows a commendable in - terest in contemporary documents , and adds to the published stock a number which he has encountered in several years of correspon - dence and travel , notably for the churches at
New Haven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other documents are repub - lished from parish histories and previous par - tial treatments , and much oral tradition is gathered up , relating both to the original struc - tures and to their transformations .

		The case of the church at
Sag Harbor	LOCATION	, built in
1843	DATE	, of which the original builder was still alive in
1912	DATE	, shows the occasional possibilities in this direction .

		Too often , however , documentary evidence is not sought insistently enough or not even demanded ; vague comparisons of unsupported assertions with estimates of probabilities take the place of methodical criticism .

		The section covering
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	at
Newport	LOCATION	, `` reported to have been built in
1726	DATE	, '' is particularly flagrant in this regard .

		``
Peter Harrison	PERSON	is reported to have been the architect of this building , but as
Peter Harrison	PERSON	has also been given as the architect of
King 's Chapel	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and other churches built toward the
latter end of the eighteenth century	DATE	, it seems improbable that he was designing at this early date , nor does the building itself bear any internal evidence of being his design . ''

		The importance of in - ternal evidence , of course , is very great , but such evidence should be verified , wherever possible , and relied on exclusively only when other testimony is found to be lacking .

		In the case in hand we know very well that
Peter Harrison	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Embury	PERSON	elsewhere de - scribes as an amateur , was our first trained architect , who came over with Dean
Berkeley	LOCATION	in
1729	DATE	and designed the
Eedwood Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Newport	LOCATION	in
1748	DATE	, a building which , like his other authenticated works , exhibits a schol - arly correctness of detail quite removed from the naivete of the church in question .

		In his concluding summary of development , as in some of the interpretations of single build - ings , the author is led astray by current misconceptions of architectural history and apparent lack of knowledge of earlier discus - sion .

		The renaissance of classic architecture in
England	LOCATION	had scarcely begun when the first
Virginia	LOCATION	colonists left the mother country , and it was the seventeenth century rather than the sixteenth in which English Gothic dragged out its moribund rural exile .

		The first
London	LOCATION	church with a colonnaded portico was St.
Paul	PERSON	's ,
Covent Garden	ORGANIZATION	, built by
Inigo Jones	PERSON	in
1631	DATE	, so that it is small wonder that St.
Luke	PERSON	's ,
Smithfield	ORGANIZATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	,
1632	DATE	, does not show more academic feeling .

		The statement that in
New England	LOCATION	the earliest church buildings resembled no English buildings at all , ignores their exact prototypes in the chap - els of English dissenters which Mr.
Ronald P. Jones	PERSON	has recently described in his little book `` Non-conformist Church Architecture . ''

		Mr.
Embury	PERSON	's treatment of the Classical Revival , , especially , reflects the habitual lack of sympa - thy with this pervasive movement .

		The ques - tion is larger than personal predilection ; it involves recognition of the historical bases of the neo-classic tendency and willingness to criticize its representatives by the canons of their own age .

		Only by such historical de - tachment can the superstition of a death of traditional art be replaced by a belief in its .

		unending vitality .

		Within the brief space of two - Autobiography n , TI/T - of a woman hundred and fiity pages ,
Miss Marie Sukloff	PERSON	, a Russian Jew - ess of twenty-nine years , has conveyed to En - glish and American readers in `` The Life Story of a Russian Exile '' -LRB- Century -RRB- an astonishing wealth of vivid information con - cerning Russian despotism and the efforts that are being made toward its overthrow .

		Miss Sukloif was born in a two-roomed hut one room devoted to the domestic animals in a village of thirty such huts .

		Inured from infancy to hardship , grinding poverty , and tyrannical oppression , she was apprenticed at the age of eleven , first to a woman grocer and then to a tailor .

		Even at that age the sor - rows of the peasants had entered into her soul .

		She had seen the fate of her aunt , out - raged and then beaten brutally and buried while still alive by the son of the neighboring country gentleman , and she had witnessed the continual desperate struggle of her own parents .

		Imbued with the new aspirations of the period , she joined in a strike and lost both her position as a tailor 's apprentice and nearly a year 's earnings , whereupon she im - mediately began devoting herself with youth - ful ardor to the propaganda of the Social Democrats .

		She was sent by her parents to
Odessa	LOCATION	to a poor uncle to secure employment , but became increasingly active as a revolu - tionist , and was selected to set up a secret printing press in
Kiev	LOCATION	, where she was arrested and thrown in prison .

		After more than two years in close confinement , she was exiled for life to eastern
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		From this remote re - gion , she escaped and brought back to
Russia	LOCATION	the baby of an exiled couple , thus avoiding recognition herself , and rendering the escape of the parents a future possibility .

		Embit - tered by her own sufferings and filled with pity for the oppressed people of her country ,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 55 she joined the headquarters of the Social Revolutionists at
Geneva	LOCATION	, and was appointed to assassinate several prominent and cruel officials , finally succeeding in killing with a bomb the terrible Governor
Khvostoff	PERSON	.

		She was condemned to death , but was exiled in - stead to a distant region of
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		After suffering for some years physical and mental hardships which threatened to unsettle her reason , she finally escaped through a daring and brilliant strategem and with the faithful assistance of devoted fellow revolutionists outside the prison .

		This escape took place from the prison at
Irkutsh	LOCATION	, where Miss Suk - loff had been taken for an operation , the long deferment of which by the heartless neglect of the officials had almost caused her death .

		It was almost by miracle that she escaped the permanent ruin of her health by the terrible experiences through which she had to pass after getting outside the prison walls .

		She was never safe from reimprisonment until she sailed from
Shanghai	LOCATION	.

		The vivid descriptions of prison interiors and prison life in the many prisons occupied by the writer , the thrilling narrative of experiences and emotions , the portrayal of numerous officials and revolu - tionists from intimate knowledge render the book a human document of the highest value .

		It illuminates dark and dreary
Siberia	LOCATION	with a lurid brilliance .

		Scarcely conceivable are the cruelties and abominations so realistically reported that the reader can not doubt their actuality .

		The book may well make one hold one 's breath in suspense , as the primitive and cruel government it exposes hurls its myriads across the frontiers of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But there is also another and very moving revelation in the little book .

		So spontaneous seem the many instances related of kindness , gener - osity , self-abnegation , and lofty heroism that one 's admiration of the Russian people rises in proportion to the indignation aroused against the tyranny of the Russian govern - ment .

		The world has surely much to antici - pate from the long deferred liberation of the Russians , and among these people none will give a finer account of themselves than the Jews , if we may judge from the gifts and the spirit of such Jewish women writers as

Russell	PERSON	then surveys the field of present - day thought and discusses three chief tenden - cies .

		There is first of all the classical tradition which descends in the main from
Kant	PERSON	and
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though still well entrenched academ - ically , this represents on the whole a decaying force .

		It is based on the omnipotence of rea - soning .

		Its world is constructed by logic with little appeal to concrete experience .

		Then there is , in the second place , evolutionism , still associated with the name of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, who in turn derives from the earlier English empiricists .

		Its modern representatives are
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	,
William James	PERSON	, and
M. Bergson	PERSON	.

		This philosophy , which is based on biology , has a predominant interest in the question of the destiny of life .

		But philosophy , if it is to be a genuine study , must have a province of its own and aim at results which the other sciences can neither prove nor disprove .

		In - tuition , insight , mysticism may carry convic - tion to the favored recipient , but , untested and unsupported , they can not constitute a suffi - cient guarantee of truth .

		The third tendency is the one which the author himself favors and to which he has given the somewhat unpre - possessing name of `` logical atomism . ''

		This has gradually crept into philosophy through the critical scrutiny of mathematics .

		It is akin to the `` new realism '' which has recently been developed at
Harvard	LOCATION	and other Amer - ican universities .

		It represents the substitu - tion of piecemeal , detailed , and verifiable re - sults for large untested generalities .

		The true function of the mathematical logic which it employs is analytic rather than constructive .

		It shows the possibility of hitherto unsus - pected alternatives .

		It liberates the imagina - tion as to what the world may be while refus - ing to dogmatize on what it is .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's chapter on the positive theory of infinity shows the indebtedness of his method to the mathematical investigations of two of the Ger - mans ,
Frege	PERSON	and
Cantor	PERSON	, and of the English scholar , Dr.
Whitehead	PERSON	.

		Such apparent para - doxes as that an infinite number can not be increased by adding to it are made plausible to the layman by a non-technical demonstra - tion .

		The last chapter is on the notion of cause , with application to the question of free - will .

		The author finds that freedom , in any valuable sense , demands only that our voli - tions shall be the result of our own desires and not of an outside force .

		Thus philosophy , in the author 's opinion , is becoming scientific through the simultaneous acquisition of new 56 THE DIAL I

		facts and logical methods .

		It has suffered much in the past from lack of modesty in wanting to attack the larger problems at once .

		But now it is ready to abandon all claims to gratify mundane desires .

		It does not even presume to prophesy about the future of the universe .

		This unpretentiousness is achieving its reward .

		The new method has already been successful in such time-honored problems as number , infinity , continuity , space , and time .

		It may be counted upon to proceed slowly from success to success .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	is one of the many English academic writers who possess an - enviable gift of expression .

		The lucidity , precision , and elegance of his style are so compelling that even the unphilosophically minded will find no stumbling blocks in his exposition .

		__ Dr.
Arthur `` Wentworth Hamil	PERSON	- ton
Eaton	ORGANIZATION	's interest in the na - n .

		- , tive Tories of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	has rendered him well fitted for the preparation of `` The Famous Mather Byles '' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	:
W. A. Butterfield	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Byles	PERSON	's relationships with the
Mathers	PERSON	, his alliance by marriage with several of the patri - cian families of
New England	LOCATION	, his long pas - torate of a fashionable
Boston	LOCATION	church , his far-famed wit , and his persistent Toryism , with the resulting loneliness and privation of his old age , all help to make him a picturesque character .

		His tradition is of the sort that is likely to grow by accretion , and particularly is this true of the stories of his wit .

		It is hard to believe that the man who was capable of some of the best things that have been ascribed to him could be guilty of some of the worst .

		Dr.
Eaton	PERSON	repeats .

		all the usual anec - dotes , generally without citing authorities , and , one is tempted to feel , without careful winnowing .

		In other biographical matters he has been thorough and apparently exact .

		He outlines the early history of the
Byles	PERSON	family in
America	LOCATION	; he cites the will in which In - crease Mather bequeathed to his grandson ,
Mather Byles	PERSON	, his wearing apparel , excepting his chamber cloak , and , on condition that the legatee entered the ministry , one-fourth of his library ; and he has unearthed the record of an interesting squabble between young
Byles	PERSON	and
James Franklin	PERSON	of the New En - gland `` Courant . ''

		He traces in some detail Dr.
Byles	PERSON	's long career as pastor of the
Hollis Street Church	ORGANIZATION	one of the many careers that remind us how much social position and fam - ily connections signified in the early life of supposedly democratic
Boston	LOCATION	.

		After the Doctor openly espoused the loyalist cause the voices that speak of him are mostly hostile , and although the biographer has given to these only their due weight the record of the later years is necessarily a trifle unsatisfac - tory .

		It is notable that Dr.
Eaton	PERSON	remarks , without mentioning his authorities , that
Joseph Green	PERSON	, the
Boston	LOCATION	humorist and dis - tiller who parodied some of Dr.
Byles	PERSON	's poems , `` had none too amiable a feeling '' toward the Doctor .

		It has usually been sup - posed that the two men , who were fellow - students at
Harvard	LOCATION	, fellow-contributors to a collection of poems , and later fellow-loyalists , were perfectly friendly in their combats of wit .

		The author has a fondness for odd col - locations of words , such as `` It is not to any one difficult in these days to see why , '' but aside from frequent sentences of this sort the book reads pleasantly .

		It contains a number of interesting portraits , a bibliography of Dr.
Byles	PERSON	's principal works , and copious notes , though these last are sometimes silent just where a citation of authority is most to be desired .

		The music of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		No one who wishes to under - stand Russian music will fail to familiarize himself with the writings of Mrs.
Rosa Newmarch	PERSON	.

		Her book on
Borodin	PERSON	and Liszt , her monograph on Tschaikowsky , and the volume here reviewed on the Russian opera all demand attention be - cause , of her intimate acquaintance with the land , the people , and the literature of
Russia	LOCATION	, as well as because of her critical knowledge of the music of Russian composers .

		Her book on `` Poetry and Progress in
Russia	LOCATION	'' should be mentioned in this connection because in
Russia	LOCATION	the musician has worked side by side with the poet , and the advancement of the fatherland has been an interest dear to both .

		In `` Russian Opera '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	-RRB- Mrs. New - march covers the whole field of operatic his - tory in that singular and somewhat myste - rious country .

		A great part of this account , especially that of the earlier periods , has merely an historical interest .

		The Russian opera became important only in the nine - teenth century .

		It was then that the great composers appeared , that the great operas were written , that the peculiarly national character of Russian music was made mani - fest , and that the strength and weakness of Russian music became known to the musical world in the work of such cosmopolitan musicians as
Rubenstein	PERSON	and Tschaikowsky , and of such nationalistic composers as the `` Invincible Band , '' or `` The Mighty Five '' -LRB-
Balakirev	ORGANIZATION	,
Moussorgsky	ORGANIZATION	, Rimsky-Rorsakov ,
Borodin	LOCATION	, and
Cesar Cui	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We find the two great critics ,
Serov	PERSON	and Stassov , obscuring as
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 well as illuminating musical controversies .

		We are introduced to the somewhat antagonistic musical circles of
Balakirev	ORGANIZATION	and
Balaiev	LOCATION	.

		We learn of the production of the operas that make Russian music perhaps the most con - spicuous body of purely national music in existence .

		Mrs.
Newmarch	PERSON	has lived in Rus - sia , has met the principal protagonists in this drama , has sympathized with their efforts and intentions , has throughout been on the patri - otic side of controversies , and yet has main - tained a judicial attitude toward everything .

		Her book is therefore authoritative and con - vincing in its utterances .

		Perhaps she makes too much of the national aspects of this music and does not emphasize sufficiently the lim - itations of all merely national music , but the value of her criticisms and interpretations is not thereby seriously impaired and her view of the movement as a whole does not disregard the region where the national shows its rela - tions to the substantially human and univer - sal .

		The book is provided with portraits , as well as a number of other illustrations , and the index is satisfactory .

		Treating , as it does , of a subject which has by no means had the consideration that belongs to it , the book be - longs in every musical library .

		Mrs.pnkhurst ' , This breathing spell in the apologia pro woman suffrage agitation in
England	LOCATION	is a good time to re - view what that agitation has effected and to consider briefly its hopes for the future .

		Mrs.
Emmeline Pankhurst	PERSON	's book , `` My Own Story '' -LRB-
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , gives an excellent even though warmly partisan account of the move - ment , especially of that part in which she has been concerned , and closes with hopeful prophecies of the future .

		Addressing herself to American readers and appealing for their sympathies , she writes with a very telling directness of speech about the attitude and methods of the English government in seek - ing to withhold from women the rights to which it will be difficult for any candid reader of her book to maintain that they have no just claim .

		Even of the violent means for obtaining them which she so notably advo - cates , she makes not a bad defence if violence is ever defensible .

		Certainly as mate - rial for a book , her stormy experiences of the last few years are rich in incidents of an unusual and not seldom a startling nature .

		And all this vehemence and hardihood , so lit - tle in harmony with accepted traditions of what is most excellent in woman and most truly characteristic of her , we find to be mani - fested not by one disappointed in early hopes of domestic happiness , soured by the repulse of her affection , denied the privilege of moth - erhood , but by a woman gently nurtured in a happy home , wedded in young womanhood to the man of her choice , with whom she enjoyed nineteen years of sympathetic and loving com - panionship , and to whom , as she relates , she bore five children .

		A most interesting and gifted personality is this that is presented so frankly in `` My Own Story , '' and at the same time the book is a clear and readable account of an important movement in English public life by the person most ardently devoted to the success of that movement .

		In closing her last chapter she feels encouraged to hope that further militancy on the part of women will be unnecessary , that past governmental mis - takes in the treatment of woman suffragists will not be repeated , and that it will be recog - nized how impossible is the task of `` crushing or even delaying the march of women towards their rightful heritage of political liberty and social and industrial freedom . ''

		The book is well illustrated , even to the point of including certain views of its writer in situations not exactly enhancing her dignity . ' '

		Biblical Libraries , ' ' as used by Book-collections j -RRB- r
Ernest Gushing Richardson	PERSON	in earliest times .

		.

		i ,1 L * ii.t j .

		a in his book thus entitled , does not mean collections of bibles , or libraries mentioned in the
Bible	LOCATION	, but book-collections worthy of the name of library `` in Biblical places in Biblical times '' ; and , quite unlike the snakes of
Ireland	LOCATION	, they were , he believes , very numerous `` thousands or even tens of thousands , containing millions of written books or documents . ''

		As in his immediately preceding book , `` The Beginnings of Libra - ries , '' the author gives to the name `` library , '' perhaps wisely , a more inclusive meaning than , for example , the Assyriologists might be inclined to allow .

		`` Archives '' might well enough be the term used by them instead of `` libraries , '' he admits , if they were writing only for one another ; `` but their case is a little different in this matter from the case of metaphysicians or crytographers -LSB- cryptog - raphers ? -RSB-

		, for the books of these men , unlike those of metaphysicians and mathematicians , are keenly desired to be read by ordinary mor - tals , the field is one of general interest and the works of these men the very best work done in the field . ''

		This keen desire on the part of ordinary mortals to read the writings of Assyriologists has not before been generally noted ; its existence is a hopeful sign in the world of letters .

		Mr.
Richardson	PERSON	's diligence has gathered material from the works of archaeologists , epigraphists , Egyptologists , and others , to fill a book of more than two hundred 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	pages , and a score and a half of helpful illus - trations are interspersed .

		The work is well done , and one is the more willing to commend it because of the author 's modest preliminary remark concerning his necessarily somewhat desultory chapters , that `` such value as they have lies chiefly in the fact that those who could do the work better do not do it at all . ' '

		As is already known to many , Dr.
Richard	PERSON	- son is librarian of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	; and so it naturally follows that the
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	issues his book .


Paris	LOCATION	in time of anarchy .

		Such scenes of tumult as may possibly be repeated before long in one or more of the capitals of
Europe	LOCATION	are stirringly presented by Mr.
Ernest Alfred Vizetelly	PERSON	in `` My Adventures in the Commune '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		At the close of the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, he returned with his father and brother to the harassed and disorganized city , and the three were present during the weeks of turbulence that followed .

		Both things actually seen and things learned on good authority are recounted by this expe - rienced chronicler of rather exciting personal adventure .

		Among other excesses of the Communists he witnessed , , for example , the burning of the guillotine in what is now the
Place Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and the conflagrations , as he calls them , of the
Prefecture of Police	ORGANIZATION	and the
Palais de Justice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , he gave some hours to pumping and to the passing of buck - ets at the latter fire .

		He also remembers listening to a public speech from
Louise Michel	PERSON	, the so-called Red Virgin of the Com - mune .

		These and numerous other personal touches give life to his detailed account of Parisian events in these memorable months .

		Narrow escapes , too , from personal injury or even death are not wanting , as where he de - scribes his casual conversation with a plumber near the Gare Saint-Lazare , and its abrupt termination by the entrance of a bullet into the workman 's temple and the whistling of others in the immediate vicinity .

		The duties of a journalist seem to have made necessary the author 's exposure of himself to the perils of the time and place , and to this necessity the book is indebted for much of its stirring quality .

		In one sense a sequel to the same writer 's earlier volume , `` My Days of Adven - ture , '' which tells the story of the famous siege , the work is nevertheless well able to stand on its own merits and can be read with entire satisfaction independently of that pre - vious narrative .

		Many illustrations from ' * contemporary prints and photographs enliven its pages .

		The teacher of ^ n Oberlehrer is a teacher in a the German German secondary school , that secondary school .

		^ ^ & claflsical `` gy mna sium , '' or its modern scientific equivalent .

		The evo - lution of this class of German school-master is traced in concise , clear outlines by Dr.
W. S. Learned	PERSON	of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the Advancement of Teaching -LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is based to a great extent on the late Professor
Paulsen	PERSON	's `` Geschichte des gelehrten Unterrichts . ''

		The author shows how the Oberlehrer was but a functionary of the church until the latter part of the eighteenth century , and how since his emancipation from ecclesiastical control he has gradually developed collective conscious - ness until his profession now ranks in dig - nity and importance , if not in emoluments , with the higher branches of law and medi - cine .

		The changes in educational outlook are also fully discussed , more especially the broadening curriculum of the last several decades since the monopoly of the classics was broken .

		Dr. Learned has a vision of the time when American teachers shall be even more rigorously selected , more amply and purposefully trained than are our lawyers and doctors .

		He finds in German educational conditions many features which we may profitably imitate .

		America , he believes , is greatly inferior in basal education and speci - fic training .

		Our teachers are more loosely organized and are too prone to regard their occupation as a stepping-stone to other things .

		But with German solidarity goes much deadening routine .

		The freedom , initiative , and responsibility which the Amer - ican teachers possess constitute a .

		priceless asset .

		The author believes further that the segregation of the sexes in the German schools has been carried too far , though he admits that the elementary schools in
America	LOCATION	have been excessively feminized .

		The education of girls .

		A more accurate title for Pro- fessor
William A. McKeever	PERSON	's `` The Industrial Training of the Girl '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- would be `` Training the Girl for the Home . ''

		The author ignores all other types of industry in which the girl might engage , and devotes his attention al - most wholly to the training of the girl for domestic occupations .

		The most remarkable characteristic of the book is the author 's unqualified faith in the happy results which he believes will follow the adoption of his rather general programme for the instruction of the girl .

		Take , for instance , the optimistic statement : `` Plain cooking , plain sewing , plain serving , and plain every-day living
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 59 once the ordinary girl has had her life well - defined and grounded in the principles of these common things , she has certainly made all the necessary beginnings of a beautiful and happy career . ''

		Again , in another chap - ter , he suggests a plan whereby the teacher would grade the girl in her monthly report on all the ordinary subjects taught in the school , and the parent in the same report would grade her on washing dishes , sweeping and dusting , preparing meals , darning and mend - ing , plain sewing , tending the baby , etc. .

		Leaving aside the question of the practica - bility of such a plan , it is doubtful whether the results would justify the author 's enthu - siastic statement that `` Thus the personality of the ordinary young woman of the future will have been made rich and deep in sym - pathy and service , full and strong in force and magnanimity , serene and poised through the inclusion of the higher things of the spirit . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Uniform in size with Mr.
Sonnenschein	PERSON	's '' The Best Books '' and Dr.
Ernest A. Baker	PERSON	's '' Guide to the Best Fiction in English '' is the stout volume , `` A Concordance to the Poetical and Dramatic Works of
Alfred	LOCATION	, Lord Tennyson '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.
Arthur E. Baker	PERSON	, F.R.Hist .8 .

		About 150,000 quotations and references are given , alphabetized on the keyword and classified accord - ing to its context or grammatical function .

		That the list of omitted words -LRB- words for which no quotation is furnished -RRB- includes less than two hun - dred fifty entries , in itself bespeaks the compre - hensiveness of the compiler 's plan .

		Over eight years ago Mr.
Baker	PERSON	, then in touch with public library activities in the north of
England	LOCATION	, felt the need of a reference work like this , and started the task of compilation which , completed after years of fruitful industry , will be of great value to the librarian , the student of English literature , and the public speaker .

		Most of Miss
Helen Dawes Brown	PERSON	's little book , `` Talks to Freshman Girls '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is com - posed of advice and suggestions about the very things that are emphasized especially in the talks of deans and instructors to girls in their first year in college the art of reading , the use of the pen , and studies '' for delight , for ornament , and for ability . ''

		Such advice , when as well expressed as it is in these .

		.

		brief essays , serves for momentary inspiration to the college girl , but it does not really get at the heart of the most pressing problems of her freshman year .

		At the end of the book , how - ever , in her last and shortest chapter , which she entitles '' Everyday Living , '' the author touches briefly upon some topics that really come home to the girl in a vital way .

		An entire volume in which each one of these questions could be elaborated and thoroughly discussed would probably prove of much more practical and lasting value to the col - lege girl than the present book .

		A translation of
M. Arzibashef	ORGANIZATION	's notorious novel , '' Sanine , '' is announced by Mr.

Jan. 16 , 1915	DATE	COMPLETE REVIEWS OF THREE NEW BOOKS WORTHY OF SPECIAL ATTENTION THE ROSIE WORLD By
Parker Fillmore Illustrated	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.30	MONEY	net -LRB- from
The New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Many of the chapters 9f this book have appeared as short stories in various periodicals , but one who has read them piecemeal and enjoyed their rich humor and keen insight into human nature will be glad to read them all again , linked up as they are in the book .

		The amazing thing is how a mere _ man can so understand the vagaries of several kinds of femininity , from forty-or-so-year-old
Maggie O'Brien	PERSON	down to little
Geraldine	PERSON	, in the throes of teething during the mid-summer heat of
New York	LOCATION	.

		At least , if he does not really understand , in his own mind , he gives such a good imitation of it that most women who read will have a little prick of self-con - sciousness behind their smiles .

		Rosie herself is one of the sweetest creations in present-day fiction .

		She has no more sense of humor then
John Shand	PERSON	himself , but when one has not a tear in the eye over her bigheartedness , her earnestness in doing what she believes to be her duty , he has tears in both eyes over the Irish humor of the situations that her earnest - ness and lack of humor so often call out .

		To one who enjoys genuine humor , without a hint of coarseness , who prefers little pictures from life that leave a good taste in the mouth , and who appreciates the setting forth of such pictures in good English , this collection will be distinctly welcome .

		BELSHAZZAR COURT Or Village Life in
New York City	LOCATION	By
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON
$ 1.25	MONEY	net -LRB- From The Nation -RRB- With a typically incongruous turn ,
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	entitles his latest volume `` Belshazzar Court , or Village Life in
New York City	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	net -RRB- .

		Readers of the
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	will recognize most of these `` field notes '' on the New Yorker in his apartment house or on the street , in the theatre or at the baseball park . '

		To the cosmopolitan these covertly serious essays will present a humorous picture of life as it is endured in
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		To the Gothamite they will seem a brilliant review of familiar but unregarded phases of his own existence .

		For they are indeed packed with shrewd , often penetrating , observation of public manners and homely customs .

		Most readers may be more taken with the writer 's fresh , quaint , witty , or hyperbolical way of putting things , since he has made his chief bid for popularity as a humorist .

		He has , to be sure , a sharp eye for the inconsistencies and insincerities of both our conduct and our ideals , and it must be conceded that there is seldom a dull page in all his wander - ing remarks .

		But his pleasantry is not the jolly English humor_of eccentricity , with laughter holding both his sides , nor is it the hearty American humor of exaggeration , artfully leading up to some surprising or grotesque conclusion .

		It is an intellectual humor that plays around ideas , finding an unexpected truth in apparent absurdity .

		In all likelihood , therefore , the discriminating conner of Mr.
Strunsky	PERSON	's para - graphs will set greatest store by the restless light of reason that flashes upon or lingers about every topic considered .

		By
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	his lucubrations would surely be pro- nounced literature , for the criticism of life is always just beneath the rippling , eddying surface of the style .

		His is far from being the easy paradoxical scintillation of the social revolutionist .

		On the contrary , the author plays the doubting
Thomas	PERSON	with regard to most of the educational , theatrical , and other fads with which our progressive age is rife .

		He even complacently pokes fun at
Bernard Shaw	ORGANIZATION	with roguish incon - sistency , seeing that in his own volume the pages have to be cut at the bottom .

		In fine , the rare quality of the book is not so much the humor as the suggestive quality of the thought .

		PELLE THE CONQUEROR Boyhood , Apprenticeship By
Martin Andersen Nexo	PERSON
$ 1.40	MONEY	net , each volume -LRB- From The New Republic -RRB- A Danish Epic From the moment when the Swedish boat lands little
Pelle	PERSON	and his old father Lasse on the shores of _ the island of
Bornholm	LOCATION	, our imaginations are caught in this northern world which , strange as it is in its primitive simplicity , is yet made glowingly real by the sympathy of genius .

		Few foreign stories place you more seductively in the very heart of the life they depict than this epic of a workingman 's life in modern
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		Only a rare spiritual fidelity to per - sonal experience could produce the color and movement and wisdom and good will of this story .

		We are told that the author was himself a shoemaker 's apprentice in the
Baltic island	LOCATION	, and then , like
Pelle	PERSON	, was sucked away into the many - towered capital .

		Here he worked as a bricklayer until he was rescued by one of the `` people 's high schools , '' those wonderful Danish popular universities scattered about the land , where farmers and bricklayers , kitchen-maids and clerks , come to spend a few arduous and fascinated months of their lives in the study oh , these sober northern people !

		of history and literature .

		This education permitted him to become a teacher , then the author of short stories and a book of reminiscences of a bright Spanish trip , and now there comes from him this four-volume story of his own life or the lives of such as he , the first volume of which , appearing in
1906	DATE	, has already become almost a Danish classic .

		The two volumes which have been translated into En - glish take
Pelle	PERSON	to the time when he leaves his island to seek nis fortune in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	.

		The life of the boy and his simple , patient old father as farm laborers at
Stone Farm	ORGANIZATION	, with its background of wind-swept heath and the distant sea ; the rough , jovial society of milkmaids and stablemen , with the fierce irascibilty of these little-tamed Norsemen ; the holidays and the drunkenness and the lovemaking ; the mystery of the old farmhouse with its kind , sensual master and the woe of the jealous mistress ; the grim old Protestant superstitions of _ the community ; the life of the small farmers lived so hardily against a cold and niggardly nature ; the reiterated themes of peasant life , the wresting of a homestead from the moor , the seductions , the fatalistic waiting of the old people for death ; all this , seen through the aimless play and riotous imagination of childhood , makes `` Boyhood '' a book of such charm that one scarcely knows whether to admire it most for its poetry or its realism , its imaginative power or its loyalty to life .

		91 THE YELLOW BOOK . ''

		The notion that the years from
1891	DATE	to
1898	DATE	were a period of decadence in English letters is already a legend .

		The
London	LOCATION	c ' Times ' ' hit it off very well when it called them `` the yel - low nineties . ''

		It is a new word , in its present sense , is it not ?

		Perhaps it goes back farther than
1891	DATE	, but we doubt it .

		Whistler made the color fashionable about that time , and pos - sibly it came to have a vague connection in the mind of the day with his personality , so vivid , so contemptuous , and so little understood .

		It is the fate of all such spirits , careless of the morality of security and ruthless in the prac - tice of that virtue of which mediocrity is inno - cent , to be regarded by their contemporaries as strange , then morbid , and , finally , wicked .

		But
Whistler	LOCATION	's fondness for yellow probably did little more than to suggest by indirection the title of `` The Yellow Book . ''

		Nothing more was required to give a name to the lit - erary and artistic character of the decade .

		The adjective has come to describe irresponsi - ble sensationalism in the newspapers .

		But it calls up very readily sensationalism in art ; and `` The Yellow Book '' seems likely to be remembered as an epitome of the exotic , the bizarre , the wicked , of `` art for art 's sake , '' and the fin de siecle .

		A certain humor , bitter enough to those who care passionately about the art of literature but not unpleasant to the ironic spirit , attaches to the legend of ' ' The Yellow Book . ' '

		For the thirteen volumes of that quarterly still exist and may be compared with the fable that has grown up about them .

		The first number , that of
April , 1894	DATE	, led off with a design by Sir
Frederick Leighton	PERSON	, than whom there was no more respectable artist liv - ing .

		This page was immediately followed by a story , `` The Death of the Lion , '' by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, who had not then written ' ' What Maisie Knew . ' '

		One of the poems was by Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	and one of the essays by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		An article by
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	on `` Reticence in Literature '' de - fended , though rather on behalf of art than on behalf of morality , the Victorian tradition 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	as to the representation of passion in fiction and poetry .

		Was it then so very devilish ?


Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	, who will be re - membered by some readers as the author of `` The Intellectual Life '' and by others along with
Harry Quilter	PERSON	as the victim of
Whistler	LOCATION	but by no one as anything but representative of Victorian appreciation in art and litera - ture , did not think so .

		He was invited by
Henry Harland	PERSON	, who must have been almost as astute as some contemporary magazine edi - tors , to write for the second volume of `` The Yellow Book '' a review of the first .

		He found two contributors whom we have not so far mentioned ,
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, to complain of .

		He recognized
Beardsley	PERSON	's quality , while objecting to his morbidity .

		He resented Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's poem , ``
Stella Maris	PERSON	, '' observing that it was of the fashion set by
Eossetti	ORGANIZATION	's `` Jenny . ''

		And he thought badly of an editor who permitted a defence of reticence to contain , even as an example of what should be avoided , three stanzas of
Swinburne	PERSON	's `` Dolores . ''

		But Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	concluded his criticism with this sentence : '' On the whole , the literature in the first number of ' The Yellow Book ' is adequately representa - tive of the modern English literary mind , both in the observation of reality and in style . ''

		Of the illustrations he wrote : '' On the whole , these illustrations decidedly pre - suppose real artistic culture in the public .

		They do not condescend in any way to what might be guessed at as the popular taste . ''

		In the three years that followed , `` The Yellow Book '' was never more shocking than in that first number .

		A contemporary reader is struck , in looking through `` The Yellow Book , '' with the number of serious and re - spectable names in the tables of contents .

		Mr.
Enoch Arnold Bennett	PERSON	and Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	are there , as well as Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Harland	PERSON	was himself a frequent contributor .

		So was
Ella D'Arcy	PERSON	.

		There is even an essay on Stendhal of all subjects by our own Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	.

		Is not the legend of the yellow `` Yellow Book '' a little absurd ?

		Perhaps there is more reason in it than appears .

		The Victorian spirit may have been as commonplace as the artistic spirit imagines it to have been ; but it was not blind to its enemies .

		It saw
Beardsley	PERSON	in `` The Yellow Book '' and sensed , if it did not know , that Sir
Frederick Leighton	PERSON	was no match for him .

		It saw very little of Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's verse .

		But it may very well have felt the man behind that little , the man who was so fundamentally opposed in his view of art and letters to all that , in the cliche of our own day , was `` sane . ''

		What it sensed or felt we have recorded for us in the meaning which attaches to `` yellow . ''

		It did not matter that
Symons	PERSON	and
Beardsley	PERSON	left `` The Yellow Book '' in order to create , in `` The Savoy , '' a more genuine magazine .

		Their names and their view were first asso - ciated with the earlier publication ; or , rather , the earlier publication was first associated with their names and their view .

		It did not matter that Oscar Wilde never contributed to either magazine .

		The smash-up of his career as a personality was widely regarded as proof that the influence of `` The Yellow Book '' on litera - ture was evil .

		The irony , of course , is not so much that everybody who cared for beauty and truth in art should have suffered for the scandal which swallowed Oscar Wilde .

		Anything else would be too much to expect .

		The irony is to be found rather in the predicament of criticism .

		Whistler thought criticism was merely stupid .

		It has sometimes been worse ; it has sometimes been cowardly .

		Criticism was intelligent enough to know that the men of the nineties had done work that was fine and strong .

		It knew that , after all , the immortal music of `` Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno
Cynarae	PERSON	' ' was infinitely more important in the consideration of
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	than the morality of his way of life .

		It knew that
Beardsley	PERSON	's mastery of design was the signifi - cant thing and the pre-occupation which was revealed in his romance ' ' Under the Hill ' ' the insignificant thing .

		It knew how much more important it is to literature that
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	wrote `` The Ballad of Reading Gaol '' than that he should have been put in prison .

		But criticism had not the courage of its knowledge .

		Compelled , on the whole , to sympathize with the art of these men and those whose names are associated with theirs , it has paid its re - spects to public opinion by emphasizing always their physical and moral weakness and never their artistic strength .

		If we were all so moral that we were always ready to recognize that which is moral and to flee from that which is of ill-repute , we should have created a very different legend about `` The Yellow Book . ''

		It is all very well to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 draw away from men who seem to have little responsibility in their personal relations .

		But it is not good to be blind to a supreme virtue .

		And there is no denying that men like Beards - ley and
Dowson	PERSON	had a supreme virtue .

		If they were not true to everything to which we demand allegiance they were true to the best thing in them .

		It is no piece of rhetoric that furnishes the refrain to
Dowson	PERSON	's poem : '' I have been faithful to thee ,
Cynara	LOCATION	, in my fashion . ''

		It is the precise truth .

		He was faithful to an ideal of art .

		And so was
Beardsley	PERSON	.

		They literally died for it .

		TEE POETS OF
BELGIUM	LOCATION	.


Belgium	LOCATION	, though lately she has lain crushed and bleeding under the heel of a ruthless invader , has nevertheless won for herself a proud position among the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		She has justified her intense nationalism ; she has vindicated her claim to live her own life ; she has carried into the battle-field the ardor and intelligent energy that had already brought her to the forefront of literary na - tions .

		It is no new thing to find a great literary renaissance coincident with other more material manifestations of national spirit ; and the
Belgium	LOCATION	that delayed the progress of the most powerful army in the world is the
Belgium	LOCATION	that had already given us
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Verhaeren	LOCATION	,
Rodenbach	LOCATION	,
Fon	ORGANIZATION	- tainas ,
Elskamp	LOCATION	, and
Mockel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since the death of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Tolstoi	PERSON	there can be little question that the foremost lit - erary reputation of to-day is that of
M. Mau	PERSON	- rice
Maeterlinck	PERSON	; his work has made a profound impression on the reading public of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		But though
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck has achieved the wider popularity , his fame must not blind us to others of the small nation that gave him birth .

		This little coun - try has been like a nest of singing-birds .

		The song of many may not have been strong enough to pierce to the outside world ; but we have to remember that it takes much to break through the barriers of a foreign tongue , and that poetry in special suffers from difficulties of translation .

		Belgian poets also have often been taken to be Frenchmen by casual readers , because for the most part French in their literary language : so that against the advantage of gaining an im - mensely widened audience has to be set the disadvantage of some veiling of their nation - ality .

		It is true that some of them could have written equally well in
Flemish M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck for instance , who is a pure
Fleming	PERSON	; and a limited number have done so .

		But Flemish is simply a variant of Low-German or Dutch , and it offers no compensating bene - fits to counterbalance its narrowing of the audience .

		In spite of their writing in French , which is at least as much their native tongue as English is the native tongue of an Irish - man ,
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	may be claimed as entirely for
Belgium	LOCATION	as Shakes - peare for
England	LOCATION	, Goethe for
Germany	LOCATION	, or Dostoieffsky for
Russia	LOCATION	.


M. Verhaeren	PERSON	has used the phrase les forces tumultueuses , and these are the best words to describe the vitality of modern Bel - gium .

		The country has been seething with tumultuous forces , intellectual unrest , vigor - ous animal spirits , pulsing life .

		Borrowing something of impulse and inspiration from its two great neighbors ,
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, something also from its own Flemish tradi - tions and from
Holland	LOCATION	, Belgian life has had the abundant virility so often found in things largely hybrid .

		`` In no other part of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , '' says
Herr Zweig	PERSON	, `` is life lived with such intensity , such gaiety .

		In no other coun - try as in
Flanders	LOCATION	is excess in sensuality and pleasure a function of strength . ''

		But the sensuality , if we must use that word , has not been neurotic or morbid ; clearly it has not sapped the vigor of the people late events have shown them robust , heroic , strong .

		It is about thirty years since the literary new - birth of the people began , its centre of origin being the now devastated
University of Lou	ORGANIZATION	- vain .

		It began in a spirit of licence and re - volt , of rebellion against authority in most things , not easily to be crushed by the forces of inertia and convention .

		Journals were started , such as `` La Semaine '' and `` Le Type , '' only to be suppressed ; and little vol - umes of verse began to appear , suggesting the influences of
Verlaine	PERSON	and Baudelaire , and suggesting also that there were new voices quite able to speak for themselves .

		.

		The finest of these voices , undoubtedly , was that of
M. Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, who has lately , in French and British periodicals , been pour - ing forth the fierce anguish of his outraged patriotism .

		He was born almost sixty years since at
St. Amand	LOCATION	, a village in the centre of the recent war-district .

		Like
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Rodenbach	PERSON	, he was educated at the Jesuit college of Sainte-Barbe in
Ghent	LOCATION	.

		`` We have the local scenery of his boyhood , its broad levels and fine atmospheric effects , its peasan - try , everywhere pervading his poetry .

		Later he studied law at
Louvain	LOCATION	, and had a share in publishing the aggressive little weekly ' ' La Semaine . ''

		A brief attempt at legal practice convinced him that literature , not law , was 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	his true mistress ; and he threw himself into his vocation with passionate and brave ardor .

		Both plastic art and music had a powerful share in forming him .

		It is a narrow soul that can only be reached through one avenue , and
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's is so sensitive that at times there has almost seemed a lack of bal - ance .

		His first book , `` Les Flamandes , '' was an outburst of crude realism ; it was a positive orgy of realistic detail , full of the grosser qualities of the old Flemish painters but pos - sessing also their exuberant vitality .

		This was followed in
1886	DATE	by `` Les Moines , '' deal - ing with the romantic and picturesque fea - tures of monasticism rather than with its spiritual depths .

		He did not go further , like
Huysmans	PERSON	-LRB- who also was of Lowland de - scent -RRB- , to a full reconciliation with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Humanity was his subject-matter ; the monk was but one among the many living men and women that attracted him .

		From this time he passed into a spiritual `` storm and stress '' period , fighting his way through a conflict with material realities to a more assured clearness and repose of soul .

		It is impossible even to name all his volumes .

		In
1891	DATE	we find him exclaiming , `` I have been a coward , and I have fled from the world into a great futile egotism '' ; but , '' L'aube ouvre un beau conseil de confiance , Et qui Fecoute est le sauve De son marais , ou nul peche ne fut jamais lave . ''

		This is the true
Verhaeren	LOCATION	; he has come to himself ' ' out of the marsh in which no sin was ever yet cleansed '' ; he has made his way toward mysticism , and toward a nobler han - dling of his material .

		He is still realistic , and never shirks ugly detail ; but he has truly emerged from haunts of the noisome .

		He has breathed a purer and more serene atmos - phere ; the far horizons of his native land have shown him something better than mere curl - ing fog or driving rain .

		He has found that there is a possible loveliness , a spiritual sig - nificance , in the stress and toil and soil of human life ; he has seen the magic of the sunset and the undying hope in the heart of man .


Georges Rodenbach	PERSON	,
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's school - fellow , born in the same year , though he early left
Belgium	LOCATION	for
Paris	LOCATION	, in spirit never really left his beloved Bruges .

		He had nothing of his companion 's bounding vitality , and his poetry , though graceful , is always subdued .

		We chiefly remember him for his prose `` Bruges la Morte , '' whose title reminds us how the living and the dead have jostled together in modern Flanders a land not only of vast activities but of dreamy , deserted old towns , sweeping rain and solitary sunsets , lingering faiths and haunted ruins .

		Such was
Belgium	LOCATION	a year since ; of its future we know nothing except that much of its charm has been robbed for ever , and that at present its glory is the thorny crown of martyrdom .

		There is great diversity in the spirit and tone of the poets who have sung for her ; some have had the daring that questions every - thing , others are conservative and Catholic .

		Such is
M. Braun	PERSON	, born in
1876	DATE	, who has drawn a beautiful symbolism from the rites of his Church , and has written of the benediction of the wine , the benediction of the cheeses a quite typical blending of the mystical and the realistic .

		Greater than
M. Braun	PERSON	is the lyrist van Lerberghe , whose verses are pure music .

		With daring imagery he tells us how '' the sun Avitli golden hair Dries the bare Feet of the rain . ''

		M.
Andre Fontainas	PERSON	, though a romantic symbolist , has dreamed that the joys of mad battle and carnage are better than dream - ing ; he has thought it would be fine to tread the grass of roads down-trodden and red - dened by the feet of fugitives .

		Perhaps now he could tell us what he really thinks ; for elsewhere he says that life is cloudless , calm , and passionless .

		His poems have a beauty of the inner life .

		Peace also is the key-note of
M. Max Elskamp	PERSON	, with his idealizations of religious phrase and symbol .

		It is a very real aspect of Flemish life that he depicts .

		In contrast , writers such as
M. Gilkin	PERSON	and
M. Giraud	PERSON	are frank Satanists .

		in the manner of
Baudelaire	LOCATION	, dealing with wild excesses of the flesh , the visible , the real .

		It would be pleas - ant to linger over the thoughtful poems of
M. Fernand Severin	PERSON	, or those of M.
Paul Gerardy	PERSON	-LRB- who writes in German as well as in French -RRB- with their touch of
Heine	LOCATION	; there might also be much to say of
M. Georges Mar	PERSON	- low , of
M. Isi-Collin	PERSON	, of Mme.
Jean Domin	PERSON	- ique .

		It is not to be denied that in some of these poets , such as
M. Mockel	PERSON	and
M. Ver	PERSON	- haeren , there are aspects to be regretted , too free a prodigality of sensuous coloring , too free indulgence in profitless realism : but we have to take these things as features of the national life from which they have sprung , and we should not truly understand
Belgium	LOCATION	without them .

		We have also to remember that the writings we have been considering are chiefly the work of young men .

		Youth often says too much ; discretion , restraint , come later .

		The notable fact is that
Belgium	LOCATION	's amazing virility on the field of battle had already manifested its intensity in the domain of literature .


ARTHUR L. SALMON	PERSON	.

		1915 -RRB- THE DIAL 71 CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE ENGROSSING THEME which at present renders it difficult for either writers or read - ers to give undivided attention to what we are wont to call pure literature , is of course the war .

		In some quarters a commendable effort is made to ignore so harsh a fact .

		One notes with approval the calm disregard of present disturbances shown by the staid and venerable ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' while to an old-time reader of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' the readi - ness of that esteemed publication to subordi - nate literature to discussion of the topic of the day might seem more than a little surprising and regrettable .

		One distinguished member of the ``
Harper	PERSON	's '' staff , however , no other in fact than the genial occupant of the `` Easy Chair , '' has favored the public not ex cathedra. , it is true , not from the chair he has so long adorned , but in a newspaper inter - view with some well-considered observa - tions on the relations of war to literature . ' '

		War stops literature , ' ' he affirms . ''

		It is an upheaval of civilization , a return to barbar - ism ; it means death to all the arts .

		Even the preparation for war stops literature .

		It stopped it in
Germany	LOCATION	years ago .

		A little anecdote is significant .

		I was in
Florence	LOCATION	about
1883	DATE	, long after the Franco-Prussian War , and there I met the editor of a great German literary weekly I will not tell you its name or his .

		He was a man - of refinement and education , and I have not forgotten his great kindness to my own fiction .

		One day I asked him about the German novelists of the day .

		He said : ` There are no longer any German novelists worthy of the name .

		Our new ideal has stopped all that .

		Militarism is our new ideal the ideal of Duty and it has killed our imagination .

		So the German novel is dead . ' '

		Russia Mr.
Howells	PERSON	does not regard as militaristic in the sense that
Germany	LOCATION	and the German people are milita - ristic .

		`` Whatever the designs of the ruling classes may be , the people of
Russia	LOCATION	keep their simplicity , their large intellectuality and spir - ituality .

		And therefore their imagination and other great intellectual and spiritual gifts find expression in great novels and plays . ' '

		This from the one who introduced to us the author of `` Spring Floods '' is signifi - cant .

		One more observation of his must here be noted : `` Of all the writings which the Civil War directly inspired I can think of only one that has endured to be called litera - ture .

		That is
Lowell	LOCATION	's ` Commemoration Ode . ' '

		This would exclude the immortal `` Battle Hymn , '' as well as the romances of
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	and Mr
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page .

		AN EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM of a novel char - acter is puzzling some of our foremost educa - tors .

		Is it for the best interests of culture that the war be taught in our schools , or should it be ignored ?

		`` In all the history of education , '' declares President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	in a current article on `` Teaching the War , '' '' I can not find that pedagogy was ever subjected to such a test . ''

		Never since the general extension of popular education has there been anything resembling the present world war , and to shut one 's eyes and the eyes of one 's pupils to its significance would seem to be extremely foolish , if indeed it were humanly possible .

		The pupil who is taught to bury his nose in his Latin grammar and see nothing of what is going on about him is being instructed in the ways of the ostrich .

		But , it is urged , war is wicked and hateful , and even mental contact with the things of mili - tarism is corrupting .

		Seen too oft , familiar with Avar 's face , we first endure , then pity , then embrace .

		Such teaching bears obvious resemblance to the anxious mother 's coun - sel to her daughter to carry on her exer - cises in natation without approaching the water .

		Adopting
Tolstoi	PERSON	's wise advice , the instructor might well enliven his pupils ' study of history by teaching it backward , tracing present world-shaking events to their more or less remote beginnings and causes .

		Professor
Cramb	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, some time before his death , and many months before the explosion of
last August	DATE	, called attention to the manner in which the old
German Empire	ORGANIZATION	rose on the ruins of the ancient Roman Empire , and pointed out certain present conditions that portended , to him at least , the rise of a great modern German Empire on the decaying structure of the British Empire .

		Thus the linking of current events with past history gives unity and a very living significance to the study of the world 's progress .

		Inciden - tally , too , object lessons in geography and ethnology , in manners and customs , in pecul - iarities of speech and costume , and in sundry other interesting things , are being impressed on alert young minds in a manner that has never before been possible .

		Small wonder that Dr.
Hall	PERSON	is in favor of getting as much out of the war as is educationally possible .

		A NEW LIGHT IN FRENCH LITERATURE rises to cheer the world in these sad days .

		An inevitable excess of enthusiasm , such as greeted , for example , those rather earlier luminaries on the horizon , Mr.
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	,
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	, Mr.
John Mase	PERSON	- field , and Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, is here to be noted , by no means disapprovingly , for we 72 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	have it on
Wordsworth	PERSON	's authority that we live by our enthusiasms .

		M.
Paul Claudel	PERSON	, hailed by some of his admirers as ranking with JEschylus ,
Goethe , Dante	ORGANIZATION	, yes , even with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, comes to English-speaking read - ers in a small collection of sketches entitled `` The East I Know , '' translated with evident taste and skill , and introduced by a sympa - thetic fellow-countryman ,
M. Pierre Chavan	PERSON	- nes .

		`` A strange phenomenon , the Christian poet , '' he says of the devout author of the volume , `` passionately , uncompromisingly , almost fanatically Catholic , in the country where
Anatole France	LOCATION	, the bantering and dis - illusioned master , holds sway , where Renan and Voltaire reigned , and with them hard rea - son distrustful of the supernatural . ''

		As illustrative of
M. Claudel	PERSON	's style , here is a passage from a sketch called `` Tombs and Rumors . ' '

		The author , who has strolled out to a suburban cemetery , is listening to the dis - tant sounds of a great city .

		`` Chinese cities have neither factories nor vehicles .

		The only noise that can be heard , when evening comes and the fracas of trade ceases , is the human voice .

		I come to listen for that ; for , when one loses interest in the sense of the words that are offered him , he can still lend them a more subtle ear .

		Nearly a million inhabitants live here .

		I listen to the speech of this multitude far under a lake of air .

		It is a clamor at once torrential and crackling , shot through with abrupt rips like the tearing of paper ... Has the city a different murmur at different times in the day ?

		I propose to test it .

		At this moment it is evening .

		They are volubly pub - lishing the day 's news .

		Each one believes that he alone is speaking .

		He recounts quar - rels , meals , household happenings , family affairs , his work , his commerce , his politics .

		But his words do not perish ... Guest of the dead , I listen long to the murmur , the noise that the living make afar . ''

		Probably the laurels of
Goethe , Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, are safe enough ; nevertheless , this modern Frenchman , who has seen something of the world in the consular service of his country , knows how to describe what he has seen .

		A SELF-CONGRATULATORY EDITOR , indulging in a pleasing retrospect upon something attempted , something done , invites his read - ers to celebrate with him the first anniversary of the birth of `` The Unpopular Review . ''

		Infant mortality among magazines and other periodicals is far greater , proportionally , than among human beings ; hence the pardonable exultation with which this fond parent of a vigorous and promising one-year-old an - nounces to the world : `` We have survived the most dangerous period of infancy , and though of course we ca n't see into our own mouth '' the parent here identifies himself with his offspring `` and are too young effectively to handle a looking-glass , we infer from some remarks we 've heard , that we 've cut some teeth ; we have had some pains that felt like it . ' '

		Contrary to the usual rule , one is glad to learn , this lusty young quarterly has elicited from subscribers and others far more testimonials of hearty appreciation than letters of complaint and fault-finding .

		In the most distant and unlikely quarters it has raised up to itself friends and admirers .

		May it not be that the fate-defying title of the magazine , piquing curiosity as it does , has had more than a little to do with this initial success ?

		But however that may be , it is a success not to be grudged to the able and alert men and women of letters who are making `` The Unpopular '' so readable if not exactly `` popular '' in the `` best-selling '' sense of that term .

		To the pardonably com - placent editor we say , in the words of the poet already quoted in this paragraph , happy , thrice happy , every one who sees his labor well begun , and not perplexed and multiplied by idly waiting for time and tide .

		THE CATHOLICITY OF POPULAR TASTE IN
FIC	ORGANIZATION	- TION shows itself in the range and variety of imaginative literature that has been success - fully adapted to the uses of the cinemato - graph .

		In the `` Branch Library News '' published monthly by the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is printed a list of the works of fiction that have been thus translated from the liter - ary into the pictorial form .

		Thirty-nine such works are enumerated , from Mrs.
Barclay	PERSON	's novel , `` The Rosary , '' at the head of the list , to Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's presentation of a quite different set of characters and incidents in `` The Virginian . ''

		Strong indeed is the con - trast in literary excellence between the first book named and two half-way down the list .

		`` The House of Seven Gables '' and `` The Scarlet Letter . '' ''

		The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, ' ' too , must not be overlooked in naming the masterpieces now offered to the millions fre - quenting the `` movies , '' nor
Dickens	PERSON	's works -LRB- to the number of eight novels or stories -RRB- ,
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Treasure Island , '' Mrs.
Jack	PERSON	- son 's `` Ramona , '' Hugo 's `` Les Miserables , '' Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's `` Quo Vadis , '' Mrs.
Shel	PERSON	- ley 's `` Frankenstein , '' and , of course , Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ''

		Though the list does not profess to be complete , it ought to have included `` The Pilgrim 's Progress , '' which has found favor as exhibited on the screen , appealing as it does to somewhat the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 73 same taste as the Biblical story of
Joseph	PERSON	, which has a place on the list .

		New titles are of course being added to these thirty-nine , with accelerating rapidity .

		POETRY IN
WARTIME	LOCATION	is holding its own cred - itably in this country at least , as Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	makes evident by the second annual issue of his `` Anthology of
Magazine Verse	ORGANIZATION	and Yearbook of American Poetry , '' a work compiled and published by him with admirable industry , taste , and , not least of all , courage .

		Ten years ago , when interest in American poetry was nearly at its lowest , and consequently much of that poetry was but little worthy of serious attention , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	took it upon himself to examine critically , but not in a destructive spirit , the magazine verse of the calendar year , and to report upon it in an enlightening and on the whole encouraging summary which appeared in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript . ''

		This labor of love he continued year after year until his annual report became an influential contribu - tion to the cause of better poetry in this coun - try and even beyond its borders ; and now for two years he has expanded this report and compilation to the dimensions of a modest vol - ume .

		This year , more than ever before , we have reason to feel gratified with the results of his studies , for they show that war 's alarms and excitements have not diverted our poets from their high calling , nor even concentrated their attention upon martial themes .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	maintains that the general excel - lence of the last twelve months ' products of American magazine verse is higher than ever a most encouraging pronouncement .

		THE DRAMA AS AN INSTRUMENT OF REFORM , not as a form of art or a means of recrea - tion , was discussed in characteristic fashion by
M. Eugene Brieux	PERSON	in his recent lecture and reading at
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	.

		His visit to Amer - ica has been called an `` informal , amicable ambassadorship , '' and his public addresses have shown him to be quite as much a humani - tarian and reformer as he is a playwright .

		The lover of art for art 's sake , pure and simple , must find little use for such ideas as this distinguished Frenchman is ventilating among us .

		He talked at
Northampton	LOCATION	on the subject of the problem play , called by many the boring play , and insisted that most of the notable comedies , including even the lighter ones of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, are really problem plays .

		He read from his own play , `` Le Berceau , '' the lesson of which seems to be that married persons having children should not be allowed to be divorced ; and from `` Les Rempla - cantes , '' which is directed against the custom of importing wet-nurses from the country to minister to the needs of
Paris	LOCATION	infants , often at the expense of these peasant women 's own children .

		That the stage should be devoted to higher uses than mere amusement was the doc - trine preached from first to last by
M. Brieux	PERSON	, who perhaps is too much inclined to lose sight of the fact that the highest of all possible uses may at times be served by an inspired work of pure art .

		THE POPULARIZATION OF CULTURE progresses apace .

		In
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, already not the least cultured of our States , the establish - ment of a state university , in addition to the excellent agricultural college at
Amherst	LOCATION	, is under consideration .

		A bill for the creation of such an institution was presented in the last legislature , and was referred to the board of education for careful consideration .

		In connection with it an alternative plan is un - der advisement for paying the tuition fees of all
Massachusetts	LOCATION	students attending existing colleges , universities , and scientific schools of a certain standard .

		This would be a rather startling as well as questionable application of the patriarchal idea in government .

		But the tax-payers , through their delegated spokesmen , will have a word to say about free Latin and Greek to the youth of the commonwealth .

		I sincerely hope that this is only the beginning of a long series of similarly startling discoveries .

		In the meantime I beg to ask a few questions of you and Mr.

		THE VARIOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED liOUD AVEBURY .

		* To his thousands of readers and admirers the late Lord
Avebury	PERSON	will always remain Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	, of `` St.
Lubbock	LOCATION	's Day '' fame , author of many delightful
Lubbock	LOCATION	books , and especially associated with certain entrancing chapters on ants , bees , and wasps , with sun - dry inspiring volumes on the pleasures and the uses of life , and , more recently , with a widely accepted list of the hundred best books in all literature .

		A playful rhymester in `` Punch '' years ago put into four lines the popular conception of the man 's chief claims to renown , and even now , after a third of a century , they have not lost their epigram - matic appropriateness .

		They were appended to a '' Fancy Portrait ' ' of Sir
John	PERSON	under the semblance of a huge bumble-bee , and ran as follows : '' How doth the Banking Busy Bee Improve the shining hours , By studying on
Bank Holidays Strange	ORGANIZATION	insects and wild flowers . ''

		Like many another versatile genius before and since ,
Lubbock	LOCATION	suffered in his reputation with specialists from the great variety of channels through which he allowed his super - abundant energies to flow .

		Among bankers , as it was rather cruelly and not quite accu - rately said of him , he was known as a famous scientist , and among scientists as an eminent banker .

		His introduction of the highly suc - cessful
Bank Holiday	ORGANIZATION	into English business life does indeed link his name lastingly with
London	LOCATION	banking , as his popular treatises on insects associate him with the entomologists ; but his device of a system of cooperative clear - ing for checks and notes received by
London	LOCATION	banks from the country , instead of the labo - rious and time-consuming individual treat - ment of such commercial items that gave place to it , showed him to be both expert and origi - nal in the sphere of banking , just as , for example , his early researches in the vitelli - genous glands of insects proved him to be not lacking in capacity for independent observa - tion and discovery in natural science .

		Born in
1834	DATE	, his adolescent years fell at a rather fortunate time and amid rather favor - able surroundings for the development of his peculiar tastes and aptitudes .

		Darwin lived at Down , about a mile from the
Lubbock	LOCATION	home at
High Elms	ORGANIZATION	, and to the influence and * LIFE OF SIR JOHN
LUBBOCK	LOCATION	, LORD AVEBURY .

		encouragement of the great naturalist he owed much .

		Acquaintance too was made with such contemporary men of science as
Lyell	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	PERSON	, and
Spencer	PERSON	.

		Though his formal education did not extend beyond
Eton	LOCATION	, be - cause both he and his father , a banker with a bent for mathematics , had a poor opinion of the almost exclusively classical curriculum of that day , and though he was called from his books at fifteen to take a place of responsibility in the paternal banking house , yet his extraor - dinary industry and mental activity made it possible for him to achieve the sort of intel - lectual training that really counted in his case and that was probably the best possible one for the work that lay before him .

		The story of that work , branching out in many directions and rich in the astonishing variety of things attempted and carried through , is what the reader finds presented in attractive detail in Mr.
Horace G. Hutchin	PERSON	- son 's `` Life of Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	, '' a biog - raphy filling two considerable volumes and undertaken with the sanction and assistance of Lady
Avebury	PERSON	and other members of the family .

		Letters , diaries , and other private papers have been placed at the author 's dis - posal , and they have been of great service in making possible a full and accurate chronologi - cal account of
Lubbock	LOCATION	's achievements in science and in public life , in authorship and in banking , as a legislator and reformer and zealous promoter of multitudinous good causes ; but , unfortunately for the best inter - ests of biography as a fascinating form of literature , these papers have not , as the biog - rapher admits , proved to be of much help in conveying any intimate sense of what man - ner of human being Lord Avebury really was .

		Huxley 's letters are far more characteristic of the writer , far more enjoyable and sug - gestive in the reading , than any but a few of the earlier ones from the pen of his more ver - satile younger contemporary .

		However , it is perhaps impossible for a man to put the best of himself into a series of books too numerous even to count without weariness , besides leav - ing his impress on the laws of his nation and on the public life of his day and generation , and at the same time draw his own likeness with speaking fidelity in his daily correspon - dence .

		Certainly
Lubbock	LOCATION	has not done so , and therefore to the number of those biogra - phies whose chief excellence lies in their being little short of autobiographies Mr.
Hutchin	PERSON	- son 's work , however admirable in other re - spects , can not belong .

		On the title-page of the book one notes the rather conspicuous insertion , to the length of fifteen lines in small print , of
Lord Avebury	ORGANIZATION	's
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 75 many society memberships and honorary de - grees , just as in the later published works from his own pen these innumerable adjuncts to his name have not failed to make their appearance , somewhat to the surprise of those who like to imagine the author of ' ' The Pleas - ures of Life '' a person of simple tastes and unaffected deportment .

		The reason of this parade of personal distinctions we are now glad to find set forth with some care by the biographer .

		It is worth quoting . ''

		He was honorary member and fellow of an extraordinarily large number of learned societies , both home and foreign , and bearer of distinctions as various as his talents .

		Some surprise has been expressed at the conscientiousness with which he gave at full length , after his name on the title - pages of his books , the initial letters indicating these degrees , etc. .

		Certainly Lord
Avebury	PERSON	's very simple character , without a touch of cynicism in its composition , made him highly appreciative of the recognition of his fellows , but one of his publishers has explained to me what he believes to have been his real motive in inscribing at full the initials sig - nifying his dignities .

		Lord
Avebury	PERSON	, in his opin - ion , was influenced by the feeling that if any let - ters of the kind were affixed to a name , a certain slight was cast on the institution which had hon - oured him if the distinguishing initials of that institution were omitted .

		His idea was that all or none should be given , more especially as many of the distinctions were of foreign origin , and it was particularly imperative , by all laws of courtesy , not to hurt foreign feelings .

		It is a motive per - fectly in accord with
Lord Avebury	PERSON	's peculiar kindliness and sensitive consideration of other people . ''

		In this connection there is an amusing bit of correspondence given by Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	which perhaps may help to explain this punc - tiliousness in the use of titles .

		An East Indian scholar once exchanged some letters with the author of `` The Pleasures of Life '' on the sub - ject of a proposed translation of that book into one of the dialects of
India	LOCATION	; and in the latter part of the correspondence occurs this reproachful passage from the pen of the
Orien	PERSON	- tal : `` Formerly your Lordship used to ad - dress ' Mr. ' or ' Esquire , ' but I don ' t know why your Lordship have omitted in the last two letters .

		Although I did not gain or lose any - thing by it , but still I wonder . ' '


Lubbock	LOCATION	's power of getting things done , both in his own person and through others , argues unusual energy and the strictest economy of time .

		Indeed , among his early papers there are various schemes or schedules assigning its particular task to each hour or half-hour of the day with a painful particu - larity hardly surpassed by `` Queed '' himself in the prime of his priggishness .

		An anecdote very much to the point is as follows : '' One of his sons told me that on the day that his father first took him into the
City	LOCATION	, to introduce him to the partners of their business house ,
Lord Avebury	PERSON	drew a book out of his pocket as soon as they were seated in the ' tube , ' and said , ' I think you will find it a good plan always to have a book with you , in your pocket , to read at odd times , ' and therewith he became at once so absorbed in his reading as to be quite unconscious of his fellow - travellers and their conversation . ''

		A pleasant personal touch and also an inci - dental testimony to the popularity of Lub - bock 's books are to be found in another passage that offers itself for citation .

		The eldest boy by his second marriage had just been sent away to school at Rottingdean . ''

		Sir
John	PERSON	affectionately notes the sorrow of himself and of
Lady Lubbock	LOCATION	in parting with him , but from the very first the school seems to have been a success .

		The boy was happy there , his reports were good and , for his age , he took a high place .

		His father and mother went down to see him .

		Sir
John	PERSON	writes that
Harold	PERSON	conducted him to the school library and pointed out with pride to the father that all the latter 's books were ' out ' boys were reading them .

		He said they were always out and were among the most popular .

		In this year both the Pleasures and the Use of Life were translated into Greek , Arabic , and Japanese . ''

		It is the first of the above-named books that , of all his works , has won for its author the largest number of readers , being now in its two hundred and seventy-second thousand -LRB- in Part I. -RRB- and in its two hundred and thirty - second thousand -LRB- in Part II . -RRB-

		.

		Of the some - what less popular kindred work , ' ' The Use of Life , '' the author noted seventeen years ago that , beside editions in English , the book had appeared in French -LRB- seven editions -RRB- , German , Dutch , Polish , Bohemian , Spanish , Italian , Greek , Arabic -LRB- five editions -RRB- ,
Marathi	LOCATION	,
Gujer	PERSON	- athi , Japanese -LRB- six editions -RRB- , Danish , Rus - sian , Armenian , and Esthonian .

		As a zealously active member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and , after
1900	DATE	, an energetic participant in the less momentous proceedings of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	,
Lubbock	LOCATION	advocated successfully many needed reforms and improvements .

		In a single parliamentary session we find him introducing three important bills , one for the earlier closing of shops , one for amending the public-library law , and one to facilitate the forming of open spaces in large cities .

		The first was blocked , says his biographer ; the other two were passed .

		He held , first and last , a great number of chairmanships , includ - ing that of the
London	LOCATION
County Council	ORGANIZATION	, and he served the causes of science and humanity and education in various capacities , official and unofficial .

		In fact , the list of his activities is much too long to be given here .

		Mr.
Hutch	PERSON	- inson makes an impressive showing of these 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	varied interests and occupations , and has pro- duced a useful and not uninspiring biography .

		It is a record such as the late Dr.
Samuel Smiles	PERSON	would have taken delight in pointing to as a most helpful one for eager and ambi - tious youth .

		Its lessons in the value of econ - omy of time , making the most of one 's resources , controlling one 's temper under provocation , and so on , are many and obvious .

		Lord

		THE DRAMA MOVEMENT .

		* The new drama is still young , still youth - fully and vigorously uncertain , still the sub - ject of prophecy ; but it seems nevertheless to have reached age and reliability enough to warrant the attempt to define it and to esti - mate the significance of its achievement and its tendencies .

		Among the most recent books , Mr.
Sheldon Cheney	PERSON	's '' The New Movement in the Theatre '' is a broad survey of strictly contemporaneous dramatic activity , especially in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, and '' The Changing Drama , ' ' by Mr.
Archibald Hender	PERSON	- son , an already well-known writer on the European dramatists , is a critical account of the contributions and tendencies of the past sixty years .

		If the lover of the stage will add to these two Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	's `` How to See a Play , '' he will possess the means of greatly increasing his capacity for enjoyment of the contemporary drama , whether as reader or witness .

		While Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's volume shares the char - acter of the other two in containing a measure of historical and critical matter , it is first of all a practical work , whose concern is the need of the play-reader or theatre-goer .

		It discourses vigorously and sensibly on the structure of the play and the method of its composition , upon the qualities which make it real drama , upon its value as a cultural opportunity , and upon its possibilities as a factor in social im - provement .

		It recites the principal facts in the history of the drama , leads up to and char - acterizes the modern school , and helps the reader to the means of making its literary as well as its stage acquaintance .

Burton	PERSON	's immediate purpose is the enlightenment of the * How TO SEE A PLAY .

		THE CHANGING DRAMA : Contributions and Tendencies .


Archibald Henderson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Richard Burton	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: By
Sheldon Cheney	PERSON	.

		By play-lover for his own sake ; but he has the ulterior purpose , as befits the President of the
Drama League of America	ORGANIZATION	, of encouraging good drama by helping to provide the ideal audience .

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	divides his time about evenly between characterization of the play - writer 's work and characterization of the new stage - craft .

		He has a great deal to say in praise of the new drama , especially in
England	LOCATION	, as `` the drama of sincerity . ''

		In
America	LOCATION	he sees the movement as `` hardly more than a promise , '' in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent as `` both a promise and a vital , lasting achievement . ''

		He is especially enthusiastic for Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	and the `` a?sthetic theatre movement , '' and hostile to naturalistic stagecraft , which he assails under the name of `` Belascoism '' as the `` theatre producer 's perfect realization of a false ideal . ''

		Recognizing the tyranny of play-house commercialism in the
United States	LOCATION	, for real progress he looks to such smaller centres of drama interest as the uni - versities and colleges , and the `` art '' theatres in the larger cities .

		The authority of Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	's otherwise excellent book is impaired by repetition and careless expression .

		The last chapter , especially , on ``
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's Service , '' contains a great deal that is already said in earlier chapters .

		There is too much of `` gripping '' and `` sincere '' and `` vital , '' to say nothing of lapses like ' ' chief protagonist , ' ' `` such protagonists as
Gordon Craig	PERSON	, etc. , '' ' ' touches were infused , ' ' and ' ' refreshing reti - cence of touch . ''

		This , however , is perhaps to be charged to the New Education rather than to the author .

		There are not a few who suspect that the `` new and broader universities that are so splendidly maintaining their place at the forefront of American progress , '' to use Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	's words , are doing rather less to preserve the ideal of the English language than the '' old hidebound institutions , with their set academic standards , '' that come un - der his condemnation .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book is primarily critical , and is exceedingly stimulating .

		Such chapter headings as ' ' The New Criticism and the New Ethics , '' `` Realism and the Pulpit Stage , '' `` The Battle with Illusions , '' `` The New Technic , '' `` The New Content , '' and `` The Newer Tendencies , '' indicate at once its com - prehensiveness , its philosophic character , and its pugnacious tone .

		Ibsen and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	are its main figures , and the social significance of the drama is the theme that runs through the whole discussion .

		Many indeed will think the theme too prominent .

		`` The great discovery of modern life ... is ... that society has become the tyrant of the universe '' ; `` the
1915	DATE	-RSB- 77 deterministic pressure of social institutions , the tyranny of capital '' ; `` the curved backs of oppressed humanity '' ; `` the tocsin of re - volt '' ; `` an age that fought with dragons and an age that fights with microbes '' ; `` the dra - matic artists of to-day , of all races and all climes , have a sense of common purpose , a cer - tain unity of aim , '' that `` may best be de - scribed as the intention of advancing the cause of civilization '' there is an abundance of these familiar expressions , and theatre-goer and play-writer begin to wonder as they read whether one more tyrant has not been set over dramatic art in the shape of sociology .

		There are drama-lovers who , while recognizing the fact of human suffering and sympathizing with it , can not agree that social tyranny has spread to the stars , or that the fault is never in ourselves that we are underlings , but always in society , or that a social drama will prove the means of regeneration .

		These people would like the privilege of sometimes wit - nessing , reading , or writing plays for pure pleasure plays which they dare to think may be made by the real artist as efficacious as the drama of `` social conscientiousness '' and ' ' moral propagandism . ' '

		In spite of over - emphasis of the social theme , however , and in spite of needless protests against the poor old unities and ' ' art for art 's sake , ' ' which no one has insisted on for a long time now , and against a really no longer tyrannous `` person called Aristotle , '' in Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	's phrase , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's volume is full of thoughtful and illuminating criticism on the drama as art , and deserves high praise .

		The reading of Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	and Mr.
Hen	PERSON	- derson for Dr.
Burton	PERSON	's book is different in purpose and character begets a number of impressions in regard to the new drama .

		In the first place , it is clear that there is really something being achieved , and that the some - thing has to do with art as well as propa - gandism .

		In the second place , there exist a striking number and variety of stage repre - sentations claiming recognition as dramatic art , and there is a great deal of fruitful ex - perimentation in process .

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	, after removing farce , melodrama , musical comedy , and vaudeville , carefully divides what is left into aesthetic drama , represented by Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's marionette-drama ,
Herr Rein	PERSON	- hardt 's mimo-drama , and the Russian dance - drama ; the drama of emotion , where `` the appeal to the eye and the ear is merely a very small aid to the effectiveness of the whole '' ; and the drama of thought , where more empha - sis is placed on the theme .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	defines a play as ' ' any presentation of human life by human interpreters on a stage in a theatre before a representative audience , ' ' and a drama as '' a particular kind of a play . ' '

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's definition seems at first sight handsomely liberal , though it does n't provide for the dance and marionettes ; but the next sentence , which begins three pages of interpretation by saying that `` the play in - trinsically , and its representation by the interpreters , must be so effective , interesting , and moving as to induce the normal individual in appreciable numbers to make a sacrifice of money and time , either one or both , for the privilege of witnessing its performance , '' would go a long way toward keeping the classics outside the definition .

		Who is the normal individual ?

		At least the normal indi - vidual of American theatrical commerce does not go to classic plays in appreciable numbers .

		But one receives the impression , too , that the classics , both ancient and less remote ^ count comparatively little with either Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	or Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	.

		Like other valiant champions of the New , their first impulse is to dispose of the past , and the past in these pro- gressive days is more or less defenceless .

		They do n't have to prove the ignorance and tyranny of the past ; they simply admit these and all its other vices and incapabilities , and go on .

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	`` has very little respect for what is commonly taken -LRB- like medicine -RRB- as authoritative criticism . ''

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	laments that `` our critics of the drama are unfortunately classic in predilection . ''

		Shakespeare did n't love the common man r Moliere sympathized with society rather than the individual , and the Greeks missed the social point utterly .

		`` The false assump - tion , which has persisted from the time of the Greeks to the present day , '' is a phrase which can be applied with ease and comparative safety to anything the modernist wishes to remove from the path of his argument .

		Along with other things New there seems to be a
New Logic	LOCATION	, which is almost capable of saying what it really means : ' ' The world up to our day has thought thus-and-so ; we think other - wise ; therefore , the world up to our day has thought wrong . ' '

		The statements of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, we are told , are incomplete and ridiculous , and he is guilty of gross and exaggerated dis - tortions of the truth .

		To prove
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's comparative mediocrity as a critic of the drama by assuming that he knew nothing beyond what he says , is of course no worse than to prove his infallibility by assuming that what he says implies everything he does n't say .

		It is the principle that is objectionable the use of an ancient and helpless person to prove anything or everything , as if he were mere statistics , or , let us say , the `` facts '' 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	connected with the immediate beginning of a , great war .

		Yet in spite of this independence and self - sufficiency in the partisans of the
New Drama	LOCATION	, it can hardly fail to strike the attention of the reader familiar with the classics that many of the virtues claimed for the drama of to-day are precisely the classical virtues , and the ancient classical virtues at that .

		Compact - ness , simplicity of plot and omission of sub - plot , breadth of character-drawing , the re - turn to the purely human , the use of scant and simple scenery , the open-air performance , the relief-theatre , the reconciliation of litera - ture and the stage , the tendency toward relig - ious drama enumerate these things to one acquainted with the whole course of the drama , and it will be Sophocles that he thinks of , not
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	or
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even the much - abused unities are being made welcome , in the one-act drama now so frequent .

		Gather all these virtues together , add nobility of lan - guage , without which drama can only by exception be other than local and ephemeral , and ' ' the sense of the nobility of life , ' ' which Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	says the dramatists of the new movement lack , insist less on ' ' the mystery and immensity of little things '' and `` the apotheo - sis of the insignificant , '' and more on univer - sals , and we shall possess again the ideal of twenty-five hundred years ago , the departure from which , as
Martin Schanz	PERSON	has said , never fails to bring its own revenge .

		Then get a national theatre and cultivated audiences , and the acting and writing of great drama will depend upon the presence of genius among us .

		But we do not possess all these virtues , either in
America	LOCATION	or abroad .

		The new drama , like all youth , is too confident , and claims too much .

		A little more modesty and a little less combativeness would be as well for the cause we all have at heart .

		The classics are not so dead , nor the new drama so `` vital and last - ing , '' as the new critics think .

		Ibsen , who receives so much attention from Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son , is already recognized by the new English artists , according to Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	, as `` not of their country , or their time -LRB- for the world has taken mighty strides forward since he ceased to write -RRB- . ''

		The social themes of to-day may easily prove to have been neither for all time nor for all places , and the ' ' symbolic romance , extensive , vast , '' which in Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's thinking ' ' bids fair to express best the artistic sense of the coming century , '' may have its own ' ' new content . ' '

		As to national theatres , in
America	LOCATION	we have none , and are not likely to have them under popular government until the popular idea of the usefulness of literature and the fine arts has undergone a change .

		The opportunity to hear good drama comes rarely to all but a very few places , and when it does come costs the price of a half barrel of flour for the Belgians .

		Art drama at cost , produced by our dramatic societies , is con - demned beforehand as `` highbrow , '' and is poorly patronized .

		In all but a few journals , criticism of the drama is either identical with advertising or the best is like the worst .

		Even the
Drama League of America	ORGANIZATION	puts the pro- hibitive price of
seventy-five cents	MONEY	on its pub - lished single plays by contemporary authors .

		It was possible at one time in the long ago to get a play of Shakespeare for
six cents	MONEY	, and the difference is not explainable wholly on the ground of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's inferiority .

		THE FKAXCE .

		* For many years it has been the fashion among superficial observers to regard
France	LOCATION	as a decadent nation .

		It is true that for some time her population has been stationary and , indeed , the last census -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- disclosed an excess of deaths over births ; but the phe - nomenon of a declining birth rate is by no means peculiar to
France	LOCATION	it exists in most countries and is symptomatic of our so-called higher civilization .

		The situation in
France	LOCATION	differs from that in
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	only in degree , and it seems only a question of time when the populations of these countries will cease to increase .

		There has also been a popular belief that the mental and physical vigor of the French , their national spirit , their patriotism , and their capacity to govern themselves have all been on the decline .

		To whatever degree this belief may have been well founded in the past , no well-informed person regards it as true to-day .

		In a book entitled ' '
France Herself Again	ORGANIZATION	' '
M. Ernest Dimnet	PERSON	, a professor in the College of
St. Stanislaus	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and a distinguished scholar who writes in perfect English , dwells upon the far-reaching transformation which the national spirit of
France	LOCATION	has undergone in recent years .

		That a remarkable change has come over
France	LOCATION	since the beginning of the twentieth century , he says , can not be denied or doubted , for everybody has felt it or heard of it .

		To present a picture of this change in its true perspective M. Dimnet starts out with a review of the intellectual and moral deterio - ration of
France	LOCATION	which set in during the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	and continued steadily until the
Tangier	LOCATION	incident of
1905	DATE	, an event which seemed to awaken the French to a realization *
FRANCE	LOCATION	HERSELF AGAIN .

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 79 of their national consciousness and kindle in the nation an esprit nouveau .

		After fifty years of fruitless and often foolish experi - mentation , distracted and gradually corrupted by false ideals and low morals , during which her precious hours and resources were wasted ,
France	LOCATION	now desires to be a nation once more : '' She is like a man whom philosophy or science mere intellectual pursuits have absorbed until some great sorrow makes him feel that he has a heart as well as a brain and has to live as well as to think in a way that will fit him for life . ''

		At the beginning of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	,
France	LOCATION	had only one rival in
Europe	LOCATION	that was
England	LOCATION	.

		The feeling of national su - premacy was expressed in a speech of the Emperor shortly after his accession in
1852	DATE	when he said , ' '
France	LOCATION	is happy ,
Europe	LOCATION	may now live in peace . ''

		This was no mere boast but an absolutely true statement of French supremacy on the Continent .

		To-day all is changed .


France	LOCATION	no longer has it within her power to impose her will upon
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The German Empire ,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	have risen oy her side to dispute her old time suprem - acy .

		The deterioration began , as has been said , in the midst of the outward splendors of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, when the seeds of materialism , the decadence of morals , the un - wholesomeness of literature , the hatred of Christianity -LRB- under the guise of anti-clerical - ism -RRB- were planted ; and these seeds produced their full fruition during the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	.

		During this period the French lived on illu - sions as on pleasure .

		Everyone seemed bent on deceiving himself .

		Everywhere the spirit of ideology and self-satisfaction was dominant .


France	LOCATION	was weakened by ideas which obscured Tier reason and enervated her moral powers .

		She could have quickly recovered from the losses of
1870	DATE	had it not been for the intellec - tual deterioration which a harmful philosophy and a lawless literature produced .

		`` Within twenty years , we are told , after
Napoleon	PERSON	's boast that
France	LOCATION	was the arbiter of
Europe	LOCATION	, she had `` fallen in power , influence , popula - tion and moral energy behind a rival whose greatness her own monarch had helped and practically made . ''

		The chief cause of the moral and political decadence of
France	LOCATION	under the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	and the `` state of dis - order '' in which the country found itself after the retirement of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	, according to
M. Dimnet	PERSON	, is to be found in the character of the constitution .

		It is , he says , a mere makeshift and is ' ' not only democratic but demagogic in its principles . ''

		The President of the Repub - lic is a mere dummy without real authority .

		He presides without governing , he attends inaugurations , opens expositions , distributes the grand prix , and hunts rabbits .

		He can not exercise a single one of the numerous and important powers which the letter of the writ - ten constitution gives him .

		The Radicals have for a long time advocated the abolition of the Presidency , but the great majority of the peo - ple desire a President who shall be a leader and a real executive like the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		When
M. Poincare	PERSON	was elected the people believed and hoped that he would be something more than a figurehead , but he too , like his predecessors , has adopted a policy of self-effacement .

		Under the operation of the constitution , as it has developed , he could not do otherwise .

		The whole trouble lies in the attitude of the parliament , which insists on subordinating every other power in the state to itself .

		It is not content with legislating and controlling the ministers in respect to their general policies , but it insists on govern - ing and administering as well .

		The result is short-lived ministries -LRB- there have been about fifty-five since the establishment of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and a President who plays only a ceremonial role .

		In its colonial and foreign policy , the Republic , we are told , has failed ; in education the results have been unsatisfac - tory and the education of the schools is mak - ing the country a nation of atheists .

		The bourgeois democracy is a fraud and the coun - try has been cursed with petty , low-born , God - hating politicians who , not content with secu - larizing the schools , have broken up the religious orders , confiscated their property , dispersed poor monks and nuns ` who had grown gray in the service of philanthropy , education , and charity , persecuted the church , and abrogated a solemn compact with the papacy that had endured more than a hundred years .

		Not stopping with this , the Radicals have tried to drive Catholics from the army and the civil service .

		M. Dimnet 's indictment of the Radicals for their anti-clerical policy is severe , but there is another side to the ques - tion which naturally , because of his clerical affiliations , he entirely ignores .

		He makes no reference to the opposition of the church to the Republic , and its well-known activities in favor of the monarchy ; nothing is said of the persecution of the greatest of French scholars and statesmen who were too liberal for the church , of its fight against
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	, of its championship of
MacMahon	ORGANIZATION	in the great crisis of
1877	DATE	, of its sympathy for
Boulanger	PERSON	, and of its opposition to science and liberal educa - tion .

		The Republicans of
France	LOCATION	believed , and the evidence is not lacking , that the schools , which until recently were under the control of the church , were teaching the chil - dren to hate the Republic .

		For these and 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	other reasons which can not be discussed here , the Republicans of
France	LOCATION	were compelled to do what they did , and although there may have been unnecessary harshness and severity in their methods , the general principle of their legislation is what Americans have always stood for .


France	LOCATION	, according to
M. Dimnet	PERSON	, had reached a state bordering on degradation when the
Tangier	LOCATION	affair of
1905	DATE	came like a flash of lightning after which the clouds lifted .

		It was one of those events , we are told , which rapidly destroys a whole system of thought .

		Since that time
France	LOCATION	has entered upon an era of regeneration , she has awakened from her apathy , and is beginning to return to her own .

		A great change has occurred in the national spirit , in the mode of thinking , in the character of the national literature , and even in the attitude of the Radical party , which seems disposed to adopt a policy of greater conciliation toward the church .

		In a concluding chapter written after the outbreak of the present war , the author re - marks that while
France	LOCATION	has been the victim of politicians and while the history of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	has been a history of radical blunders , recent events have shown that the nation has remained sound at the core .

		Ani - mated by a new spirit , conscious of her power ,
France	LOCATION	is ready to meet her duty .

		What she now needs most is not a conversion of mind or soul but a transformation of her institutions .

		With better institutions and the kind of lead - ers she desires , the beginning of the century will soon appear as one of the greatest turning points in her history .

		With much of what
M. Dimnet	PERSON	has to say in criticism of the French constitution and of the class of politicians that have governed the country since the advent of the Third Re - public , well-informed Americans will agree , although there will be a difference of opinion concerning his reproach of the Republicans for their anti-clerical policy .

		Most of us will feel that his rather gloomy picture of French democracy and his indictment of the Republic have been overdrawn , but we all will share with him the pride which he feels in the birth of a new
France	LOCATION	, and his optimism for the future .

		STUDIES IN THE HISTORY or ART .

		* Of the essays in Mr.
Richard Norton	PERSON	's luxu - rious volume , `` Bernini , and Other Studies in the History of Art , '' some continue the lit - erary tradition of English criticism , others * BERNINI , AND OTHER STUDIES IN THE HISTORY OF ART .

		By
Richard Norton	PERSON	.

		With sixty-nine plates .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the scientific tradition of exact scholarship .

		To the first group belong the estimate of
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	, the `` Art of Portraiture , '' the `` Phidias and
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, '' and , essen - tially , the `` Head of
Athena	ORGANIZATION	from Gyrene . ''

		Not claiming to add to our stock of knowledge , they seek to clarify it or to modify our critical judgments .

		The most powerful of these , and the most necessary , is the essay on
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since
Ruskin	PERSON	, and in the English-speaking world ,
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	, like all the artists of the Baroque , has lain under the condemnation of a prejudice at once irrelevant and unjustified .

		An ethical criterion , itself not germane , has been invoked against them , without appreciation of their own moral sincerity .

		More serious , because more philosophically supported , is the notion that they represent a time of purely artistic decay , inevitably following periods of growth and maturity .

		The analogy with organic life which this view presupposes , however , like - wise has failed of demonstration , and the his - tory of art , if subjected to any metaphor , seems rather a succession of beats of a pendu - lum , or an alternating crescendo and diminu - endo , at any point of which greatness may appear .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	finds
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	's greatness in merits characteristic of his own time and individuality spiritual intensity , artistic crescendo , dramatic power as well as in per - sonal and moral qualities common to the titanic spirits of all ages .

		It is primarily with
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	's work in sculpture that the author has concerned himself , passing lightly over equally distinguished work in architecture , yet in the field of sculpture alone he makes good his claim that
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	is to be ranked as one of the world 's greatest masters .

		The other essays of this group , dealing with less controversial material , lead to less striking conclusions .

		Portraiture , Mr.
Norton	PERSON	sug - gests , has two possible modes , and but two : the embodiment of thought , as exemplified by the Greeks and Venetians , and the embodiment of action .


Michael Angelo	PERSON	, though like Phidias in so many respects , and like him a supreme master , was less fortunate in his background , and his works are in the main monuments of thwarted purpose .

		The head of
Athena	ORGANIZATION	from
Gyrene	PERSON	, the work of a local sculptor , illus - trates how pervading were the fundamental characteristics of the Greek genius human - ism and directness .

		More promising are those portions of the book which are descriptive or scientific in their aim , the richly illustrated catalogues of Ber - nini 's clay models and his designs for the
Piazza	PERSON	of St.
Peter	PERSON	's , and the two essays deal - ing with
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sketch book for the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 81
Piazza	PERSON	, to be sure , has been already twice pub - lished by foreign scholars , yet it might have been made to give up further secrets relative to the gradual development of the project in
Bernini	LOCATION	's mind .

		The author 's idea , however , seems rather to have been merely to adduce the drawings as illustrations of
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	's mys - ticism in conception , grandiose power , and care in study .

		For a similar purpose , appar - ently , the superb collection of sculptor 's mod - els owned by Mrs.
Brandegee	PERSON	is illustrated and described without any study of their relations to the completed figures to which they corre - spond .

		It is the essays on Giorgione which most repay the scholar .

		They summarize the at - tributions made by previous writers , and attempt a new and corrected list of his works , based not only on a `` combination of the best points of the work of these very differently endowed critics , '' but on personal acquaint - ance with the originals as intimate as theirs .

		Agreement or disagreement with his conclu - sions will depend mainly on one 's principles of historical criticism .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	reacts against what he considers an excessive atten - tion to externality and detail in
Morelli	PERSON	's methods , at the same time protesting against Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's occasional affirmations of mys - tical faith .

		From a similar impressionism , in - deed , Mr.
Norton	PERSON	is by no means free .

		In - stances could be multiplied from the book in hand of ascriptions made or denied without any assignment of logical grounds .

		Without pressing the argumentum ad hominem , how - ever , we may raise the question whether another method which Mr.
Norton	PERSON	'em ploys by preference is superior to those of his prede - cessors .

		It is based on the assumption that an artist postulated as great can never repeat himself , or fall below the standard established for him .

		Such a doctrine of infallibility , read - ily maintained in a case like that of Giorgione by casting doubt on the authenticity of every - thing inferior , falls to the ground in any case where a great number of works are authenti - cated , as in the case of
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	has to deprecate among the known works of Bernini failures exactly similar to those which he cites as impossible in
Botticelli	LOCATION	and Gior - gione , yet to him
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	is a master of coor - dinate rank and equal inspiration .

		Although his purgations of this sort are of doubtful value , Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's suggestions on the posi - tive side must be very seriously considered .

		He adds to the list of
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	's works the `` Gypsy Madonna '' in
Vienna	LOCATION	, ascribed to
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, the `` Pieta '' of the Correr Museum -LRB- perhaps a copy -RRB- , ascribed to
Bellini	PERSON	, the ``
David	PERSON	and Solomon '' in the
National Gal	ORGANIZATION	- lery , ascribed to the school of
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	, and , under reserves , a portrait of a youth in
Vienna	LOCATION	-LRB- copy -RRB- .

		For the `` Madonna , '' espe - cially , he gives solid grounds for his belief , in an analysis which is a model for such discus - sions .

		The book is written with a positiveness of expression which may alienate those to whom its conclusions are unpalatable , but it is a posi - tiveness to be respected as the result of in - dependent study and personal conviction .

		Dwarfing the loose compilations on artistic subjects with which we have usually to con - tent ourselves in
America	LOCATION	, the book comes as a reassuring testimony of faith that painstaking scholarship and concentrated thought may still receive a hearing .

		YOUNG OF THE '' NIGHT THOUGHTS . ''

		* It is strange that a poet so popular and influential in his day as the author of ' ' Night Thoughts '' should have had to wait a hundred and fifty years for an adequate biography in his own language .

		This has been the fate of Young ; and therefore Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's substan - tial `` Life and Letters of Edward Young '' fills a real need .

		For the first time we have in English a full-length portrait of that `` polite hermit and witty saint , '' as Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	called him .

		But there already existed in French an accurate and exhaustive study of
Young	ORGANIZATION	's life and works , by
W. Thomas	PERSON	, pub - lished at
Paris	LOCATION	in
1901	DATE	.

		Incredible as it may seem , Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	appears never to have heard of this admirable biography .

		If he had been able to consult it , he would have avoided a number of minor errors and some really serious ones , and could have filled certain gaps in his narrative .

		Thus he tells us -LRB- p. 2 -RRB- that `` one other child was born of the marriage '' of
Young	ORGANIZATION	's parents ;
Thomas	PERSON	shows from the parish records of Upham that
Young	PERSON	had three sisters , two of whom , to be sure , died in childhood .

		Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	, repeating earlier writers , says that Lady Young died in Janu - ary ,
1741	DATE	; Thomas cites an entry from the
Welwyn	LOCATION	parish register showing that she died
January 29 , 1739	DATE	or 1740 .

		The mistake is serious , because upon the date of Lady Young 's death depends the interpretation of a famous passage in the `` Night Thoughts , '' involving the identification of the central characters , and , to some extent , the whole question of the sincerity of the poem .

		The matter is too complex to be discussed here ; but it may be said that Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's wrong * LIFE AND LETTERS OF EDWARD YOUNG .

		By
Henry C. Shel	PERSON	- ley .


Boston	LOCATION	: Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	date leads him to suppose that
Young	PERSON	left his wife in her last illness to pay a visit to the Duchess of
Portland	LOCATION	, and that he listened to the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	's suggestion of a second mar - riage at a date indecently near that of his wife 's death .

		Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's friendliness to the poet causes him to gloss over these sup - posed delinquencies ; but an examination of the
Welwyn	LOCATION	records would have shown him that Young needed no excuses .

		The great value of Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's biography of Young is in the abundance of new mate - rial which it presents , consisting chiefly of a series of letters from the poet to
Margaret	PERSON	, Duchess of
Portland	LOCATION	.

		This correspondence covers the last twenty-five years of
Young	ORGANIZATION	's life ; it began in
1740	DATE	, when the poet was fifty-seven and the Duchess twenty-five , and ended only a few weeks before his death in
1765	DATE	.

		The letters show Young at his best , as a man of the world , courtly , witty , and sensi - ble ; deeply religious , and grave on occasion , but more often gay .

		Incidentally they give us a high opinion of the charm and goodness of the lady who inspired them .

		Her letters to Young are unfortunately lost ; by the direction of his will , all his papers were destroyed .

		It is thus partly his own fault that he has waited so long for a biographer , and has been generally thought of as the mel - ancholy type of a `` grave-yard poet . ''

		Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	has very properly emphasized the other side of
Young	ORGANIZATION	's temperament .

		We see the poet entertaining friends at his home , amusing the Duchess with lively stories , or rallying her on her failure to appreciate his friend
Richardson	PERSON	's `` Clarissa '' ; `` your great - grandchildren , '' he tells her , `` will read , and not without tears , the sheets that are now in the press . ''

		We see him at the age of sixty - two making friends with that aged butterfly ,
Colley Gibber	PERSON	, and delighting in his company .

		Reproached for this intimacy , he defends himself : `` As for poor
Colley	PERSON	, his impu - dence diverts me , and his morals shall not hurt me , though , by the way , he is more fool than knave , and like other fools is a wit . ''

		In another letter he complains humorously of the insincerity of one of his fair admirers : `` Lady
Andover	LOCATION	does me honor in remember - ing that I exist .

		Yet 't is all compliment ; there is no sincerity , or she had not disap - pointed my assignation with her .

		Why go to town !

		Dishonorable creature !

		She is gone only with her husband ! ''

		Another letter of half - jocose moralizing ends as follows : ' ' Your Grace will wonder what all this means , and what gives occasion to such random stuff .

		Why , Madam , I am now in a coffee-house waiting for a rascally attorney , who , having robbed me already of all my money , would now rob me of my time ; and rather than do nothing , which is very tedious , I was deter - mined to write nothing to your Grace . ''

		This is the Young of the satires , who could hit off so aptly the hypocritical church-goers : '' And when their sins they set sincerely down , They 'll find that their religion has been one , '' or the ignorant librarians : '' Unlearned men of books assume the care , As eunuchs are the guardians of the fair . ''

		But Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	does justice also to the serious Young , the Young of the '' ` Night Thoughts , '' who placed in his garden a `` painted bench , a mere optical deceit . ''

		and inscribed on it the motto , `` Invisibilia non decipiunt , ' ' As a portrait of the man Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's book is in many respects excellent .

		Apart from his inaccuracies as to fact his chief weakness is on the critical side .

		His estimate of
Young	ORGANIZATION	's work is not always discriminating ; for in - stance , he rates the turgid tragedies much too high .

		Little or nothing is said of literary influences on
Young	ORGANIZATION	, and almost nothing of
Young	ORGANIZATION	's own great influence .

		His popularity on the Continent , for example , signalized by translations into a dozen languages , is an ex - tremely interesting matter to which Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	scarcely alludes .

		These are grave omissions ; and here again the French study would have furnished invaluable aid .

		When all deductions are made , however , we must remain grateful to Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	for his sym - pathetic and attractive portrait of a poet nowadays neglected , and above all for the delightful series of letters which he has made available .

		NATURE IN Music .

		By
Lawrence Oilman	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 83 and
Scarlatti	PERSON	, '' and who has since gone on accumulating laurels until his place among the leading men in musical interpretation and literature is almost equivalent to a final and positive verdict of posterity .

		We have here a number of essays , some of which have seen the light before , dealing with the deeper aspects of music in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		One paper , however , is devoted to the Italian composer of oratorios ,
Don Lorenzo Perosi	PERSON	.

		The author attempts to some extent a comparison of recent German and French composers , and makes no very profound secret of his predilection for the men of his own land and time .

		This statement is not meant to be disparaging , but to indicate the point of view from which the work is written .

		Our author also seems to be an eloquent advocate of music with a programme as the highest form of music , a position which makes him something of a reactionary .

		This view may be a recoil from the extreme views of
Wagner	PERSON	and
Strauss	PERSON	, and is perhaps shared by many musi - cians of to-day ; but it is always difficult to take the step backward , and history , after all , never repeats itself .

		The French composers of whom
M. Holland	PERSON	speaks are
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	, Saint-Saens , d'Indy , and
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	; the German composers are
Wagner	PERSON	,
Strauss	PERSON	, and
Hugo Wolf	PERSON	.

		He has a separate essay in which he compares German and French music ; and there is an elaborate account of the musical movement in
Paris	LOCATION	since
1870	DATE	, which he calls ' ' The Awakening , ' ' a title which leads to some consideration on the reader 's part .

		The date
1870	DATE	has its con - notations , and one may ask oneself what may become of French and German music after the sinister years of
1914	DATE	and
1915	DATE	.

		The essay on
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	is especially note - worthy .


M. Holland	PERSON	is frank in revealing
Berlioz	PERSON	's weakness of character , and in our opinion gives altogether too much attention to that side of the case .

		The close connection between character and achievement is indis - putable , but art has mostly to do with the lat - ter , and in the lapse of the years the misdoings of exceptional intelligences are lost in the record of service to the advancing destinies of the race .

		His view of
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	, and indeed his view of music as a whole , may be gathered from the following paragraphs : '' Before
Berlioz	PERSON	's time there was really only one master of the first rank who made a great effort to liberate French music ; it was Rameau ; and de - spite his genius , he was conquered by Italian art .

		By force of circumstances , therefore , French music found itself moulded in foreign musical forms as most men speak more than they think , even thought itself became Germanized , and it was diffi - cult to discover , through this traditional insin - cerity , the true and spontaneous form of French musical thought .

		But
Berlioz	PERSON	found it by instinct .

		From the first he strove to free French music from the oppression of the foreign tradition that was smothering it . '' ''

		Berlioz is thus the true inheritor of
Beetho	LOCATION	- ven 's thought .

		The difference between a work like the ` Romeo and
Juliette	PERSON	' symphony of
Berlioz	PERSON	and one of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's symphonies is that the former , it would seem , endeavors to express objec - tive emotions and themes in music .

		I do not see why music should not follow poetry in getting away from introspection and try to paint the drama of the universe .

		Shakespeare is as good as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Besides , one may add , it is always Berlioz that may be discovered in his music ; it is his soul , starving for love and mocked at by shadows , which is revealed through all the scenes of Romeo . ''

		The above quotations indicate the trend of
M. Holland	ORGANIZATION	's thought , and the method of his procedure .

		When he comes to treat of Ger - man music , it must be said at once that he is eminently just , and generous in his admira - tion .

		We may point to the essay on
Hugo Wolf	PERSON	, in which genuine appreciation of the musician vies with sympathy for the un - toward fate which overwhelmed the great tal - ent at so many places and times in its career .

		In the comparison between French and Ger - man music , it must be conceded that his bias in favor of the music of his own country shows itself fully and clearly .

		Art , however , de - mands allegiance for its own sake , and it is certainly time that we should outgrow na - tional prejudices in matters of universal concern .

		Nobody talks about French mathe - matics ; why make so much of French hiusic , or German music , or Italian music ?

		The realm of art is above national limitations , it is its own creator , its own arbiter , its own appreciator .

		In it we become conscious of universal humanity , and nations are like shad - ows of the night disappearing in the splendor of the daytime .

		In the essays on
Strauss	PERSON	and
Wagner	PERSON	we see reflected
M. Holland	PERSON	's pre - disposition for the symphony with the pro- gramme ; he finds it somewhat objectionable in
Strauss	PERSON	when in the `` Sinfonia Domestica '' he omits the programme altogether , and he evi - dently prefers
Wagner	PERSON	in the concert room to
Wagner	PERSON	in the theatre .

		He says : '' There are dilettanti who pretend that at a con - cert the best way to enjoy
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's last works where the sonority is defective is to stop the ears and read the score .

		One might say with less of a paradox that the best way to follow a per - formance of
Wagner	PERSON	's operas is to listen with the eyes shut , so perfect is the music , so powerful is its hold on the imagination that it leaves nothing to be desired ; what it suggests to the mind is infinitely finer than what the eyes may see .

		I have never 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	shared the opinion that
Wagner	PERSON	's works may be best appreciated in the Theatre .

		His works are epic symphonies .

		As a frame for them I should like temples ; as scenery , the illimitable land of thought ; as actors , our dreams . ''

		We have no space to tell of the appreciation of d ` Indy , which is intense , or of the idealiza - tion of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	, who represents to
M. Holland	ORGANIZATION	in their highest form some of the salient char - acteristics of the French , or of the sincere rhapsody on the theme of Saint-Saens .

		There is not a page of the book without arresting thought or insight ; there is the enthusiasm of the genuine lover of his art ; there is no un - reasoning admiration , but the analytical ten - dency of the modern critic .

		Coming from such a source , the book is , of course , authorita - tive , and to those who love music it will prove an opportunity to gain not only pleasure but an outlook fine and high .

		Mr.
Lawrence Oilman	PERSON	's book , `` Nature in Music , '' follows in the main the same direc - tion as
M. Holland 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first essay gives the title to the volume .

		It is a history of the growth of nature expression in music .

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	says : '' The strongest appeal of natural beauty has always , then , been chiefly to people of emotional habit , and especially to those of untrammeled imagination and non-conformist tendencies ; in other words , to poetically minded radicals , in all times and regions .

		It is probable that the curious and enlightened enquirer , bearing in mind these facts , would not be surprised to find , in studying the various expressions of this attraction , as they are recorded in the arts , that the uniquely sensi - tive and eloquent art of music has long been the handmaid of the
Nature	ORGANIZATION	lover ; and he would be prepared to find the
Nature	ORGANIZATION	lover himself appear - ing often in the guise of that inherently emotional and often heterodox being , the music maker . ''

		The transcriptions of nature in music date back to very early periods .

		The earlier at - tempts at nature description , however , were merely imitative or sentimental ; that is , they were subjective ; the painting of nature objec - tively belongs to recent times ; the further advance to the use of nature expression as a symbol of spirit or intelligence , belongs to the latest composers ,
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	,
MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	,
Loeffler	PERSON	.

		An example of the earlier nature music is
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's `` Hebrides '' overture , which gives us the emotions of the composer in view - ing natural scenery .

		An example of the later nature music is
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	's `` La Mer . ''

		The essay , while here and there amenable to the charge of being overburdened with lan - guage , gives , nevertheless , a really satisfac - tory view of the contention of music in the matter of nature transcription , and contains a strong defence of programme music , which is repeated in more than one other place in the book , showing how near the subject is to the author 's heart , and how important he con - siders it .

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	is evidently a mystic of the highest type .

		He has been a student of the oriental literatures , and he bathes his subject everywhere in the light which never was on land or sea .

		This gives a unique quality to his writing , and leads him everywhere to posi - tive conclusions .

		In an age of prevalent negation and materialistic nihilism , this is a fine faith and assurance .

		So in his essay on `` Death and the Musicians '' he makes ; his climax with
Schubert	PERSON	's `` Death and the Maiden , ''
Wagner	PERSON	's `` Isoldens Liebestod '' and
Strauss	PERSON	's `` Tod und Verklarung , '' in all of which there is imaged a region wonderful , over which destroying time has no control .

		With the defence of
Herr Hugo von Hoff	PERSON	- mannsthal as given in the essay on ``
Strauss	PERSON	and the Greeks , '' apropos of the modernized ' ' Electra , ' ' we are less inclined to be satisfied .

		There is certainly no objection to poet or musician making such use of the myth as he sees fit , filling it with a modern significance and giving it splendors which it never had before .

		The utterance , musical or otherwise , belongs to him who does it best .

		But for the introduction of unnecessary disagreeable de - tails , and the lowering of tone in a drama there seems no adequate excuse .

		The music of
Strauss	PERSON	, however , to the `` Electra , '' is in the heaven of all its desires , `` it is full of his typical qualities he never halts or fumbles ; he has a superb assurance .

		His mastery of his imaginative material and of his technic is absolute . ' '

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	has a reasonable word to say in regard to opera in English .

		He comes in gen - eral to the conclusion that an opera should be sung in the language which its composer gave to it .

		He considers this country lucky over European nations in that it can always hear an operatic work in the language in which it was produced .

		He instances the unhappy translations with which we are all familiar , in which the music does not fit the words ; he thinks that it is hopeless to expect that a talent spanning both music and words so completely as to be able to make a suitable translation could be induced to devote itself to so thank - less a task as the pouring of the liquor of thought from one vessel to another .

		It would be irresistibly led to creation , either in the drama or the opera .

		Therefore it behooves the English-speaking public to encourage the bringing forth of English operas which will have the importance of
Wagner	PERSON	and
Strauss	PERSON	and
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	in their respective mediums .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 85 We can not close this notice without refer - ence to the essay called a `` Musical Cosmopo - lite , '' which deals with the German - American composer , Mr.
Charles Martin Loeffler	PERSON	, who , although born in
Alsace	LOCATION	, has done all his work in our own country , and takes place as an American composer , for which let us be duly thankful , as we have need of many recruits in the department of music .

		Mr.
Loeffler	PERSON	has now found his place on programmes everywhere , and in the opinion of our author , is one of the greatest masters living to-day , with a message , sombre , perhaps , but high and noble , and with great control of musical resources .

		The book has some of the qualities of the music of which it treats ; it has its enthusi - asms and its repugnances ; it is full of knowl - edge , both of music and literature ; it gives to music its place among the great and serious arts ; it recognizes that music , like every art , is expressive of the World Ideal ; and it must add to the genuine understanding of music wherever it is thoughtfully read .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Until the outbreak of war the nearer capitals of continental
Europe	LOCATION	held important colonies of American students , many of them youthfully eager and impecunious .

		Remoteness and growing differ - ences in standards between these temporary exiles and their fiction-reading compatriots at home sug - gest possible reasons why American writers have not utilized material so seemingly fitted for their purposes to any notable extent .

		It is , perhaps , as well , since it has remained for Mrs.
Mary Roberts Rinehart	PERSON	to open the way with a book of unusual interest , '' The Street of Seven Stars '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		The leading characters are an American girl , studying the art of the violin in
Vienna	LOCATION	, and a physician , her fellow-countryman , seeking wider knowledge .

		They are given the attributes we like to think of as American , satisfying admirably our idealists , though all suspicion of exaggeration is removed by the use of an eminently undesirable person or two and the sympathetic treatment of the Viennese introduced .

		A wide range of emotions is successfully depicted and the love story is tender - and true , and hopelessly impractical , as ideal love stories may well be .

		A refreshing novel , '' Sons of the Rhine '' -LRB- Des - mond FitzGerald -RRB- , has been translated by Miss
Louise T. Lazell	PERSON	from the German of
Herr Rudolf Herzog	PERSON	's '' Die Wiskottens . ''

		The scene is laid in the province of the
Rhine	LOCATION	where the valley of the river Wupper is given over to manufacturing , and the title of the work in the original is the family name of the manufacturers , a father , mother , and six sons , with whose fortunes the pages are con - cerned .

		The elder sons inherit the business abilities - of their parents , the founders of a growing ribbon factory , while the two younger are of poetic and artistic bent , and one intermediate is a scientist .

		The most aggressive of the number is wedded to a wife of tendencies which Americans will recognize as Puritan in the less worthy sense of the word , and her coldness leads to an estrangement which ends with her complete surrender to the facts of life as her husband lives it .

		The youngest boy makes an earlier failure as a painter after running away from home to study , but his designs for new ribbons go far toward saving the business from the effect of a relentless competition .

		It is one of those artificially artless stories in which everything that has been wrong turns right at the best possible moment , and is likely to appeal to a large follow - ing .

		The character studies are well done and the translation excellent , except for the numerous scriptural quotations , where Miss Lazell might have used the English authorized version to advan - tage .

		The book is free from militarism ; indeed , from Germanism , with the exception of an extraor - dinary line from
Von Moltke	PERSON	, '' In its own strength , in that alone , lies the strength of a nation . ''

		The italics are the author 's , and the sentiment fairly astounding . ''

		Yourself and the Neighbours '' -LRB- Devin-Adair -RRB- is made up of a series of brief descriptions of life in
Ireland	LOCATION	among the peasantry , chiefly among their small sons and daughters , written by Mr.
Seumas MacManus	PERSON	and illustrated by Mr.
Thomas Fogarty	PERSON	.

		As in others of Mr.
MaeManus	PERSON	's books , the knowledge displayed has been gained at first hand , and is treated with complete comprehension and sympathy .

		The same may be said of the pic - tures , which lack nothing of the wit of the text .

		It is such stories as these that interpret racial spirit and bring to foreigners the assurance of a common humanity which is the truest internationalism .

		Excellent melodrama makes up Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	's `` Anne Feversham '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , a story of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's time in which the author has had the daring to introduce
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his theatrical associates as subordinate though important char - acters .

		A beautiful youth is condemned to death most unjustly .

		A lovely girl has just been soundly whipped by her irate father for disobedience and cast into a dungeon where she is neighbor to the beautiful youth .

		They effect their escape and have the most astonishing adventures , eventually falling in with the
Lord Chamberlain	PERSON	's Players at
Oxford	LOCATION	, she disguised as a boy and both as gypsies .

		The part of
Rosalind	LOCATION	, which she had originally inspired , is created by her before the Queen , and a happy ending , virtue rewarded and vice rebuked , crowns the story .

		`` The Place beyond the Winds '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- is Mrs.
Harriet T. Comstock	PERSON	's newest adventure in fiction .

		Its scene is laid near the Canadian border and its characters are tough pioneers and woods - men and their gentler teachers and offspring .

		The girl leaves a most unhappy home with her name under a cloud , and becomes a trained nurse in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Once there , the interest becomes largely medical and the most difficult of all problems con - fronting the practising physician she solves by cut - ting the knot .

		This divided interest does not add to the artistic value of the work , but it will surely serve the cause in which M. Brieux conceived and 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	wrote more than one of his plays .

		The characters of the book are strongly differentiated , and the narrative diversified enough to appeal to many tastes .

		Practically impossible as it is for the author to be more explicit in stating the terms of her problem , it strikingly lacks definition .

		Irony and hyperbole combine with a very pretty wit to make Mr.
Stephen Leacock	PERSON	's `` Arcadian Adventures of the Idle Rich '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- that rare bird in contemporary English literature , a success - ful satire .

		The treatment of our plutocrats is episodic , though many of the characters appear in several of the tales .

		Nearly all of these are of pre - posterous wealth , which the men are striving to increase , only such persons of average possessions being admitted to the pages as tend to enhance the evidences of conspicuous waste .

		The reader will probably find the note rather shrill for continuous reading , much as the work deserves to be read .

		The merger of two fashionable churches , one
Angli	PERSON	- can and the other Presbyterian , along the lines of the most approved methods of high finance is one of the best bits of witty sarcasm in recent print .

		The heroine of Mr.
Dion Clayton Calthrop	PERSON	's `` Clay and Rainbows '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is about as disa - greeable a piece of feminine flesh as has appeared in recent fiction , quite degenerate , even to the point of suggesting that she would certainly be held a moron in any morals court .

		Incapable of con - stancy , she contrives to keep one fairly good man and several others who are not so good in a state of more or less complete unhappiness from one cover of the book to the other .

		Before the tale is com - pleted , not one of the characters has retained the reader 's sympathy , being thoroughly committed as lacking in elementary morality , good taste , or com - mon sense .

		BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS .

		It is a curious and regrettable o !

		l s ^ te .

		artment fact that the g reat executive de - partments of our Federal Gov - ernment have not received from students and writers a measure of attention commensurate with their interest and importance , or in fair proportion to the amount of study which has been devoted to the presidency , the houses of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or even the courts .

		Until very recently there was not one book in which the organization and working of any one of the departments was described adequately , for either the expert or the general reader .

		There is , of course ,
Ingersoll	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of the War Department , '' Gushing 's `` Story of Our Post Office , ''
Swank	PERSON	's `` Department of Agricul - ture , '' and
Easby-Smith	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		not to enumerate a considerable list of histories of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		But all of these works -LRB- except that of Mr.
Easby-Smith	PERSON	, pub - lished in
1904	DATE	-RRB- are antiquated , or are mere popular sketches , or are histories rather than descriptive treatises .

		And the several excel - lent monographs which have been written upon various individual bureaus or adminis - trative services make no pretense of covering the field .

		To the student of political science , therefore -LRB- and doubtless to many people who lay no claim to such designation -RRB- , Mr.
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	's `` The
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is highly gratifying , first be - cause in its plan and execution it so closely ap - proximates the ideal piece of work of its kind , and secondly because the preparation of it has fallen to a writer of such exceptional qualifi - cations .

		For many years - Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	occupied the post of chief of the
Bureau of Citizenship	ORGANIZATION	in the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	, and his knowledge of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	is the product not only of prolonged and painstaking historical investi - gation but of personal observation and of act - ive participation in the
Department	ORGANIZATION	's activi - ties .

		His book is technical rather than popular in character , and it is at the same time histori - cal and descriptive .

		It is not a history of diplomacy , or a series of biographical sketches of the secretaries of state .

		It abounds , fur - thermore , in lengthy citations from laws , cir - culars , and regulations .

		But , as the author rightly says , these documentary passages tell the story more accurately than a paraphrase could do , and unquestionably their use will contribute to a realization of the expressed desire to make the book , so far as it goes , defini - tive .

		The first three chapters recount suc - cinctly the history of the varying arrange - ments made for the conduct of foreign affairs by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	and by the Con - gress of the Confederation , supplementing ad - mirably the chapters of Mr.
Learned	PERSON	in his `` President 's Cabinet '' dealing with the gen - eral administrative aspects of the period , and leaving apparently little or nothing further to be said .

		Two chapters are devoted to the creation and organization of the
State Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ment in
1789	DATE	, two others to the functions once exercised by the
Department	ORGANIZATION	but now with - drawn , together with those which are still exercised only on occasion , and two more to the
Department	ORGANIZATION	's past and present internal organization .

		Seven chapters serve for an analytical discussion of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	's present functions .

		And the volume closes with an interesting account of the buildings and rooms utilized for the work of the Depart - ment throughout the past century and a quar - ter .

		With respect to the allotment of space one criticism only may be suggested .

		The diplomatic and consular services are covered together in a single chapter of but twenty pages .

		More space might well have been given them , even at the sacrifice of some details pre - sented upon other and less important subjects .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 87 A British admiral 's retrospect .

		Caustic comment from Admiral Lord
Charles Beresford	PERSON	on naval and other matters of current interest has obtained some publicity of late , and shows him to be as incisive in speech as he has proved himself unhesitating and vigor - ous in action during his long and distinguished service afloat and ashore , in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	and in parliament , and in whatever rank or capacity it has been his lot to serve his country .

		In ' ' The Memoirs of Admiral Lord
Charles Beresford	PERSON	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he does not fail to reveal a mastery of his native tongue such as few sailors can claim .

		Very early in his sea - faring life , which began when he was but thir - teen years old , he demonstrated the sufficiency of his vocabulary in an amusing manner .

		He was asked to be coxswain of a racing crew belonging to the ``
Marlborough	LOCATION	, '' the first ship of war to which he was assigned as naval cadet , and the invitation was extended in these words by the spokesman of the deputa - tion entrusted with the business : ' ' Well , sir , it 's like this here , sir , if you 'll pardon me .

		Yew be young-like , and what we was thinking was whether you have the power of language that du be required . ''

		`` I said I would do my best , '' relates the one thus honored .

		`` I did .

		I astonished myself . ''

		In his enthusiasm for his calling , he rises almost to the realm of poetry in an early chapter , which opens thus : `` I wish I could convey to my readers some - thing of the pride and delight which a sailor feels in his ship .

		But who that has never had the luck to be a deep-water sailor , can under - stand his joy in the noble vessel , or the uplift - ing sense of his control over her matchless and splendid power , born of a knowledge of her every rope and sail and timber , and of an understanding of her behavior and ability .

		For every ship has her own spirit , her own personality . ''

		Admiral
Beresford	PERSON	comes of illustrious and gallant Irish stock , one mem - ber of which , Admiral Sir
John Poo Beres	PERSON	- ford , achieved both unusual glory and uncom - mon length of years , dying in
1884	DATE	at the ex - treme age of one hundred and sixteen .

		Lord
Charles	PERSON	himself , as we learn , but not from his own narrative , has in the course of his strenu - ous life broken his breast-bone and parted with a piece of it , broken his right leg , right hand , right foot , five ribs , one collar-bone three times , the other once , his nose three times , and one of the bones of the pelvis ; but though he was in youth marked for an early grave by the wiseacres , his energy of will has carried him through to a well-preserved ma - turity , for not yet can he be called old , being still on the sunny side of seventy .

		His two - volume autobiography is packed with events of interest , sometimes of thrilling interest , and often of great historic importance .

		His life is , in very truth , a part of his country 's his - tory .

		Mr.
L. Cope Cornford	PERSON	provides the book with useful Introduction and notes , and many illustrations are interspersed .

		The life of a great singer .

		There is an undeniable fascina - tion about the men and women who have won a prominent place in the theatre , where we go to see life moving before us in a sort of dream .

		The applause which they receive , the splendor in which they appear , the idealization which we give to their character and attainments , set them apart from the ordinary human being , and give interest to them in every aspect in which they manifest themselves .

		We like especially to know about them as simple human beings , and an opportunity to gaze into their daily life away from the glamour of the stage is gladly seized upon .

		Madame
Lilli Lehmann Kalisch	PERSON	in her book , `` My Path through Life '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , presents us with an autobiography singularly minute and agreeable .

		She begins with her girlhood days and passes on to the period of her extraordinary triumphs , when she was almost without question the greatest singer of her time .

		Her book shows her to be a woman of remarkable insight and intelli - gence ; her aims are , and have been , as high as those of the art which she made grander and nobler by her efforts ; w r e doubt whether any singer ever lived who brought to her art sincerer devotion .


Lilli Lehmann	PERSON	came of a musical family .

		Her mother ,
Marie Loew	PERSON	, was a distinguished singer in opera , and her father ,
Carl August Lehmann	PERSON	, was one of the famous tenors of his day .

		The father proved a wayward person and his death released the family from considerable embarrassment .

		The mother , who had left the stage , became harpist in the orchestra of the theatre in
Prague	LOCATION	, and maintained herself and two daughters thus , and by giving lessons in sing - ing .

		Both girls followed their mother in their careers , and
Lilli Lehmann	PERSON	seems to think that her sister
Marie	PERSON	was a greater artist than her - self .

		The account of these youthful days is very entertaining , and the young girls soon had many chances of appearing in public , securing thus an education which subse - quently proved invaluable to them .


Richard Wagner	PERSON	comes into their life very early .

		He was a friend of the mother , and at one time made a serio-comic proposition for the adop - tion of Lilli .

		After some effort a professional engagement for the elder daughter
Lilli	PERSON	was obtained at the
Prague National Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, and the life-work began in earnest .

		The book will 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	be found enjoyable by musicians and laymen alike ; for it is the story of a grand woman and a great artist at her best .

		The translation by Mrs.
Alice Benedict Seligman	PERSON	is in the main well done and the portraits and other illustra - tions add to the value of the book .

		The mind of Dostoievsky .

		Miss
Ethel Colburn Mayne	PERSON	's translation of the `` Letters of Dostoevsky '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book that will interest all admirers of the Rus - sian novelist .

		The letters contain much that our reading of the novels had prepared us for and a little that was less to be expected .

		The extraordinary preoccupation of the young Dostoieffsky with European literature , for example , will be somewhat surprising to many of his American readers .

		On the other hand , his characteristic enthusiasms are set down here at the greatest length , with a fullness , indeed , that is a little trying to the patience .

		He was the most fanatical of Slavophils , find - ing little to admire and much to condemn in the civilizations of the
West	LOCATION	.

		He was a mystic in politics as in religion , and the efficiency of modern
Germany	LOCATION	desolated his soul , while
France	LOCATION	seemed to him decadent and immoral .

		The hope of European civilization appeared to him to lie in ' ' holy
Russia	LOCATION	, ' ' though he found it difficult to convey this hope in intelligible terms .

		His unfortunate quarrel with Tour - guenieff was intensified by the latter 's con - tempt for Russian pretensions .

		Throughout the letters , as in the novels , one is struck by the singular confusion that characterized ; Dostoieffsky as thinker .

		His grasp of abstract ideas was always uncertain , and he was never able to discipline himself by a rational con - sideration of any subject that had deeply engaged his sympathy .

		The letters , although illuminating to those already familiar with the novels , should not be read as an introduction to
Dostoieffsky	ORGANIZATION	's works ; they should be read only by those who have already gained some knowledge of the strength and the weakness of the man who wrote them .

		Wonders and riches of the Enamoured of our youthful and .

		^ .

		, - , i i vigorous Far West , though him - self a resident of the effete East , Mr.
E. Alexander Powell	PERSON	, F.R.G.S. , writes with both enthusiasm and knowledge concern - ing the manifold attractions and possibilities of the vast domain stretching from the Mexi - can border to Puget Sound , and even beyond , to the Alaskan boundary line .

		This region he has traversed in a motor-car , being , he be - lieves , the first to make the journey in that manner . ' '

		The End of the
Trail	ORGANIZATION	' ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , describes in vivid style and with a wealth of pictorial accompaniment the incidents of the undertaking , with such items of geographical and agricultural and miscellaneous informa - tion as naturally include themselves in a nar - rative of this kind .

		Especially impressive is the change recently wrought in the desert regions of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	by the introduction of artificial irrigation , whereby the sandy wastes of
New Mexico	LOCATION	and
Arizona	LOCATION	are made to develop unsuspected fertility and the face of nature is marvellously transformed .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's chapter-headings indicate the tone of his book ; he chooses such picturesquely de - scriptive captions as `` Conquerors of Sun and Sand , '' `` Chopping a Path to To-mor - row , '' `` The Land of Dreams-Come-True , '' `` Where Gold Grows on Trees , '' `` The Coast of Fairyland , '' and `` The Valley of Heart 's Delight . ''

		Allowing himself a sufficiency of rhetorical exuberance to preserve his style from dullness , he perhaps carries to excess the familiar devices of exaggeration and allitera - tion , as where he describes 1 the road from
Phoenix	LOCATION	to the
Roosevelt Dam	ORGANIZATION	, which he calls ' ' the trail of a thousand thrills , ' ' and says ' ' its right-angle corners and hairpin turns are calculated to make the hair of the motorist permanently pompadour . ''

		This last expres - sion is a favorite of his in emphasizing the startling character of far-western scenery .

		As in his preceding volume , `` The Last Fron - tier , '' the author gives evidence of much expe - rience as a `` gentleman rover '' -LRB- to use a term of his own -RRB- and an alert observer .

		There is a wealth of entertainment and information in his pages .

		, ... .

		, The
William Brewster Clark	PERSON	The biological .

		* i .

		n n basis of human Foundation at
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	aims to throw light in a genu - inely scientific spirit upon the relations which research and scientific discovery of to-day bear to individual attitude and social policy .

		The second series of lectures , `` Biology and Social Problems , '' was given by Professor
G. H. Parker	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and they admirably carry out both in letter and spirit the purpose of the enterprise .

		The first lecture deals with the fundamental conceptions and discoveries of modern biology regarding the structure and action of the nervous system , in its relation to reflexes , freedom , and memory .

		The second concerns itself with the secretions of the duct - less glands and those mysterious chemical sub - stances known as hormones , which profoundly affect and control the activities of organs , de - velopmental processes , and secondary sexual characters .

		The third lecture discusses the wonderful revelations of the secrets of repro - duction and heredity and their practical ap -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 89 plication in genetics .

		The closing lecture is a conservative estimate of the present status of our knowledge of the factors of organic evolu - tion , consisting of a frank recognition of the profound inadequacy of our present proved ground , a relegation of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's natural selec - tion to a place of secondary importance , and a confident belief that experiment and analysis will ultimately place in man 's hands a fuller knowledge of the factors which have brought about his existence .

		Lucidity , definite prog - ress to conclusions , frankness , and breadth of view characterize this book and make it one of the best brief statements of current biological thought so far published for the general reader .

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		A person who believes that Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	wrote Shake - speare 's plays is not quite so crazy as a Baconian .

		Raleigh had far more than
Bacon	PERSON	of the Elizabethan versatility ; he had also more imagination , and a very pretty talent for poetry .

		Still no one with any sensi - tiveness to style could suppose that the author of `` Give me my scallop-shell of quiet '' could have written the tragedy of
Lear	PERSON	or `` The Tempest . ''

		Nothing so imponderable as lit - erary quality , however , is noticed by Mr.
Henry Pemberton , Jr.	PERSON	, in his `` Shakespere and Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He applies , as he tells us in his Preface , methods to which he has ' ' been accustomed in the study of physical sciences . ' '

		Perhaps it is this scien - tific training which leads him to find profound significance in the fact that on the title-pages of some early editions the name of the author is spelled with a hyphen , `` Shake-speare . ''

		Surely it is not the scientific method which leads Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	to repeat from
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	an outrageous calumny on
Richard Burbage	PERSON	, based on a passage from one of
Jonson	PERSON	's masques ; for if Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	had looked up the reference , even he must have seen that
Kingsley	PERSON	entirely misunderstood the passage .

		In justice to Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	, how - ever , it should be said that he discovers no acrostics or cryptograms , but relies for his evidence upon a number of `` topical allu - sions '' in the plays and sonnets , which can be explained as referring to various circum - stances in
Raleigh	LOCATION	's life .

		Some of these ex - planations are neat and by themselves plausi - ble .

		But the book exhibits beautifully the three fundamental weaknesses characteristic of its class .

		Practically all such books are based in great part upon -LRB- 1 -RRB- a literary stu - pidity which can not distinguish between sharply contrasted styles , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a form of snob - bishness which , in defiance of literary history , assumes that no work of the highest merit can be done by an author of obscure social stand - ing and irregular education , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- an encyclopaedic ignoring of all the facts which do not fit into the writer 's theory .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` The Short Story '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Professor
E. A. Cross	PERSON	of the
State Teachers	ORGANIZATION	' College of
Colorado	LOCATION	, is a well selected collection of eighteen or twenty prose narratives with an Introduction and brief notes .

		Unlike many recent books on the same subject it gives no directions to the pros - pective writer of short stories , but aims to help the thoughtful reader to a better understanding of this literary form .

		Five new volumes in the Greek section of the ''
Loeb	PERSON	Classical Library '' have come to hand , as follows : the second and final volume of Mr.
Walter Miller	PERSON	's translation of Xenophon 's '' Cyropaedia , '' two volumes of a ten-volume translation of ''

Oxford Editions	ORGANIZATION	, '' which include the following titles :
Newman	PERSON	's '' The Dream of Gerontius , and Other Poems '' ; `` The Poetical Works of
George Crabbe	PERSON	, '' edited by Messrs.

William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	; and the poems of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, including '' The Saint 's Tragedy , '' `` Andromeda , '' and other verse .

		123 THE THREE-PLY THEE AD OF LIFE .

		Mankind is always within six months of starvation , and therefore it must work that is , act .

		And when it gets a day off and turns to play it generally chooses a play of action .

		Action is as universal as the casing air .

		.

		And this action , the action of stokers and steve - dores , of locomotive firemen and ironworkers , of doctors facing contagious disease or lawyers fighting graft and injustice , of women in childbirth or the charge of families , - is full of heroism and dignity .

		Nine-tenths of us , probably , deserve the Iron ,
Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the decoration would have no value if so profusely bestowed .

		We have to have representatives in glory .

		Real distinction in the active life is only for the chosen of a few favored classes .

		Thucydides , describing the return of Bra - sidas , the Spartan general , , after a victorious expedition , says : `` He was received almost as if he had been an athlete . ' '

		`` We suppose that the player who kicks a goal or makes a home run does receive applause more tumultuous and dizzying than falls to the lot of any other mortal .

		But the fame of a Brasidas is rather more permanent .

		Of all men of action , in - deed , the final and most satisfying - award goes to the soldier .

		Statues are erected for them , histories are written around them , they live in legend and the memory of the people .

		The world recognizes that they risk more than other men , and as a rule from more unselfish mo - tives .

		Generals of course do not to-day lead picturesque charges ; but before they get to be generals they have to chance their lives again and again .

		They are the most concentrated examples of that heroism which is the ideal - of the race .

		Explorers , discoverers , pioneers of various kinds , deserve to and do attract the admiration of mankind .

		Statesmen are far less deep in our affec - tions .

		For one thing their actions are not so open and straightforward .

		They mine like moles in the dark .

		For another thing , they are a protected class , and do not much risk life or limb .

		But they have great issues in their hands , and genius and devotion will make their memories sacred .

		Opportunity , how - ever , plays a great part in their success .

		We 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	are all potentially politicians .

		Probably every third man one meets on Broadway or Chestnut street would make a tolerably decent Presi - dent of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		As they say of Hamlet , the part plays itself .

		The nation speaks and acts through its representative .

		It is a mere truism to say that the men of action are the servants of the men of thought .

		The contemplators , the meditative minds , are the real dynamos that move the world .

		They are the earthquakes , the volcanoes , which every now and then break up the crust of formulas that is always tending to thicken over human life .

		Gautama , profoundly dis - satisfied with his palace and his princeship , puts on the yellow robe , takes up the begging bowl , and becomes a guide to a quarter of the human race .

		Christ , born in a manger , con - fronts the Roman Empire , and in time it van - ishes before him .

		Socrates , amid the most brilliant civilization the world has ever known , starts questionings about the soul and the good of life which after a while tumble that civ - ilization down .

		Luther looks at the Roman Catholic creation of
Europe	LOCATION	and sees that it is not good , and it is shaken by his breath .

		Rous - seau sees the horror of the ancien regime and finds watchwords and formulas for the new age .

		The latest example of a thinker 's power has been so much discussed that it is hardly worth while to advert to it , except to say that it is a revolt against
Rousseau	PERSON	's revolt .

		The doctrines of liberty and equality had been car - ried so far that it seemed to him time for the ideas of rule and superiority to assert them - selves .

		All these thinkers drew after them vast agitations , changes , revolutions .

		Probably more than half the wars which the historic world has known can be directly traced to them or their like .

		The struggles between the
Eastern and Western Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, the Mohammedan invasions , the Crusades , the Thirty Years ' War , the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars , all these conflicts and many more received their impetus from thinkers who desired only the good of man .

		And undoubtedly they have wrought his good .

		The clash of ideas and ideals has kept humanity fluid .

		Even if it could be cast in a mould of perfection , that would only be a liv - ing death .

		But full of imperfection as it is , too much rest means decay and degeneration .

		If the ocean were still it would stagnate ; but the winds and waves that send ships to the bottom , and eat away the confining coasts , keep the waters salt and sweet .

		The thinkers , then , are at once destroyers and saviors .

		The destruction they work is so frightful that men instinctively sense them , before their theories get into operation , and offer them the cross , the hemlock , the prison cell .

		If they escape these things it is because they seem so harmless that their fellows think them of no account .

		Mrs.
Darwin	PERSON	once called her cook into consultation to provide some dainty to tempt her husband 's appetite , which was failing .

		`` Begging your pardon , Mum , but if Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	would do a little work he would have an appetite . '' ' '

		But Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	does work , '' objected her mistress .

		`` Him work ! ' '

		said the cook . ' '

		Why , I see him with my own eyes
this morning	TIME	sitting for two hours in the garden , looking at an anthill . ''

		The only work
Darwin	PERSON	did was to tear down the dam-wall of tradition and let out on the world a ravaging , but possibly a fertilizing , flood .

		But we can not be soldiers in the war of ideas all the time .

		We must have rest , recreation , happiness .

		There must come halcyon days , hours of charm and effortless exaltation .

		And that is what the creative minds give us .

		Theirs is an almost flawless bestowal .

		Shake - speare does not declare war , Rembrandt does not bombard cathedrals ,
Beethoven	PERSON	does not starve out populations .

		They give us the keys to another world , a world enough like ours to be intelligible to us , but fairer , more glo - rious , more perfect , and infinitely more amus - ing .

		And our residence in that world is not merely a refined kind of lotus-eating , which lifts us up as gods for the moment only to drop us back on the hard stones of reality ; it is not only `` the world 's sweet inn of rest from troublesome annoy '' ; no , it is a school of virtue .

		The precepts of the prophets do not really do us as much good as the examples of the poets .

		The great , the magnificent , the lovely , are there for us to admire and imitate ; and the evil , the horrible , the grotesque , are there for us to avoid or laugh at .

		All art must have its shadow to make its light stand out .

		The deeper the shadow the more vivid the light ; but it is the light which attracts .

		Being so rich and almost blameless in their gifts to man , one should think that the poets in words and sounds and colors and forms would be welcomed , or at least would escape being stoned as the prophets are .

		But the
1915	DATE	-RSB- 103 generality of them are starved in life and pur - sued with malignant rancor after death .

		What fables are existent about Shakespeare and
Moliere !	ORGANIZATION

		What pitiful picayune gossip about
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	and Car - lyle !

		The eternal whipper-snapper is like Gulliver perched upon the shoulder of Glum - dalclitch , and only sees rugosities and sores in what to equal eyes is the complexion of health and goodness .

		The hand of mediocrity gravi - tates inevitably towards the mud .

		Anything shining only attracts it as a target .

		The scandal-mongers ought to have their mouths washed out with soap and an odorless excava - tor put to work on their minds .

		It is a three-ply existence which we possess , and we ought not to follow exclusively any one of the strands .

		Absolute devotion to the active life brings us out at a pretty low level of intel - ligence .

		The contemplative mood is divorced from practicality , and is likely to make us persecute and kill one another because of dif - ferences of opinion on points of theology or about the summum bonum .

		We can lose our - selves in art ; but there , too , we get out of touch with reality , and lacking knowledge of the world will not even know what is good art .

		The wise thing is to exercise all our facul - ties ; but unfortunately in order to do any - thing important we must concentrate .

		We must save all our oil for one lamp .

		Hence the men of action will continue to persecute the prophets whom sooner or later they must obey ; and both will brush aside the creative artists who do the least harm , and who add some - thing of permanent value to the common stock of the world .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		POETRY AND EFFICIENCY dare we name the two in the same breath , or even on the same day ?

		And will the poet and his dream ever be subjected to the indignity of the efficiency test , ever be brought so low as to have their efficiency curve plotted by some efficiency ex - pert ?

		Heaven forbid !

		Yet in these days when economics , linguistics , ethics , and even politics , are being brought into line with mathematics and the other exact sciences , can one hope that poetics will escape the general doom ?

		Already , if we mistake not , some ambi - tious candidate for a Ph.D. degree has devoted a laborious thesis to the discovery of an alge - braic formula that shall express the degree of emotional effectiveness in any given piece of poetry .

		A keen observer of the spread of effi - ciency standards in all departments of human activity gave an address , not devoid of humor , before a recent gathering of educators .

		From this address , now printed in `` The School Review , '' a brief passage is pertinent here .

		Professor
Fred Newton Scott	PERSON	is the speaker .

		`` In every field of knowledge in economics , in psychology , in linguistics , in sociology , in ethics , in short in all the looser - woven ` ics ' and ` ologies ' somebody is setting the screws a little harder .

		In every one of these depart - ments of instruction some stern , wall-eyed thinker , rising stiffly and frowning upon his shamefaced colleagues , has announced that in his book or brochure or syllabus the subject has at last been elevated to the status of mathe - matics , physics , chemistry , and astronomy .

		Nay , even in such irresponsible , Ariel-like subjects as literature , music , and the arts gen - erally , the same motive is seen at work .

		Within the past few years a book by the brother of an eminent scientist , himself a scientist of some note , professes to have raised to the dignity of an exact science the whole subject of poetry . ''

		This evidently refers to Mr.
Hudson Maxim	PERSON	's work , `` The Science of Poetry and the Philosophy of Language . ''

		But it is not too much to hope that the
Ariel	PERSON	- like spirit of poetry will not be found to have been caught and imprisoned for all time within the definitions and rules of that scien - tific treatise .

		A PLEA FOR LIBRARY SUPPORT is put f
Orth	PERSON	in what should prove an eloquently persuasive form by the administrative officers of the Chi - cago
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		It brings to prominent notice some significant facts not very credita - ble to those who have the apportionment of the city 's annual income .

		Spending last year only 1.26 per cent of its total tax receipts on its public library , while in the same period it spent , wisely enough , nearly fifty per cent on its schools ,
Chicago	LOCATION	is found to rank , in respect to library support , with cities having approxi - mately only one quarter of its population and area .

		In other words ,
Boston	LOCATION	and
Cleveland	LOCATION	, in proportion to their size , are four times as liberal in their treatment of their public libraries .

		But even with its present inade - quate resources the
Chicago	LOCATION	institution man - ages to take no lower than second place , among our ten largest cities , in its circulation of books and in the number of library-users .

		The number of volumes that it owns , however , places it third in a similar scale of rank , while in the number of volumes per inhabitant it stands at the foot , and in the per capita cost of its library service , under the present parsi - 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	monious policy , it holds the same unenviable position .

		In its number of branch library buildings the city likewise leads the class at the lower end .

		The shame of
Chicago	LOCATION	may be stated in still other and more definite terms , if the foregoing be not humiliating enough .

		In a table of annual per capita expenditures for library purposes embracing the same ten larg - est cities , we find
Pittsburg	LOCATION	heading the list with fifty -
three cents	MONEY	for each inhabitant , Bos - ton following as a close second with
fifty-one cents	MONEY	.


New York	LOCATION	coming fifth with thirty -
three cents	MONEY	, and the metropolis of the middle West contenting itself with the last place and an expenditure of but
fifteen cents	MONEY	for each member of its population .

		The whole situa - tion is put graphically before one .

		by means of diagrams with accompanying figures , in the printed appeal referred to above .

		It ought to succeed in starting something , to the benefit of the third largest public library in
America	LOCATION	and its long-suffering users .

		BATTLES AND BOOKS represent two very dif - ferent kinds of human activity so different , in fact , as to be mutually antagonistic .

		Nev - ertheless , as is shown by the `` Publishers ' Circular '' in a review of
England	LOCATION	's book-pro - duction for the year recently closed , it is not impossible for a powerful nation to carry on warfare and publication at the same time .

		For the twelve months there was a decrease of less than seven per cent , as compared with the preceding twelve months , in book-publishing , or a fall from 12,379 to 11,537 ; and in the rather panicky months just after the outbreak of hostilities the difference was not so great as might have been expected .

		August produced 427 books , against 703 in
August , 1913	DATE	; Sep - tember 853 instead of the
1203	DATE	in the same month of
1913	DATE	; and
October	DATE	rallied to the extent of
1244	DATE	, not a serious decrease from the
1696	DATE	of the year before .


November	DATE	's record exactly equalled that of
November , 1913	DATE	, and
December	DATE	exceeded by 135 the num - ber credited to the last month of the preceding year .

		Significant of the seriousness of men 's minds in these trying days is the increase of religious books , from 889 to 969 , in the British book-trade of
1914	DATE	as compared with
1913	DATE	.

		Perhaps there is an equally obvious signifi - cance in the lessened production of philosophi - cal works 179 as compared with 280 a partial exclusion of German-made philosophy being probably responsible for some of this decrease .

		Sociological discussion seems also to have been somewhat restricted , the fine arts are not quite so flourishing , travel falls off a little , and even biography wanes all , pre - sumably , on account of the war .

		On the other hand , however , a new department of literature is admitted to the statistical tables , a depart - ment of naval and military works , which cer - tainly owes its present prominence to the existing belligerent state of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Four hundred and two books are classed under this new head , and many of them have had large sales .

		It would be interesting now to learn what effect the war has had on the book-trade of
Germany	LOCATION	, hitherto the foremost of book - producing nations .

		A GENEROUS BENEFACTION TO ARTS AND LET - TERS comes to public notice in Mr.
Archer M. Huntington	PERSON	's gift of a site , in upper Manhat - tan , for a building to serve as a home for the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters and the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The situation is suitable though not , to an architect , ideal .

		It is at
Broadway	LOCATION	and 155th and 156th streets , where other learned socie - ties have their habitations , and where there - fore the openness of space requisite to give dignity to a fine building is lacking .

		The Hispanic Society , the
Numismatic Society	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	are already here installed , and their presence will help to coun - teract the less dignified aspect of the monster apartment houses that hem in the proposed site on two sides .

		How to erect something less than a sky-scraper that shall not be dwarfed by these pretentious rookeries will be a problem for the resourceful architect to wrestle with .

		A brief backward glance shows interestingly at this time that the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	will ere long be rounding out its second decade , having come into existence in
1898	DATE	, while the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, its offspring , has six fewer years of useful activity to its credit .

		Of the original seven chosen by the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	as a nucleus to the proposed Academy , Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells , the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	's President , is the only one now living ,
Clemens	PERSON	,
Stedman	PERSON	, Hay , Saint -
Gaudens	PERSON	, and La Farge having all paid their debt to nature .

		Our Immortals , it will be noted , number fifty , and not forty ; but our
Academy	ORGANIZATION	embraces all the arts , whereas the French Academy is , ostensibly at least , one of letters .

		Our Academy will , in its proposed home , front no
River Seine	LOCATION	, have as an ap - proach no Pont des Arts , but it is always pos - sible that it will build more stately mansions as the swift seasons roll .

		A BROAD-GAUGE PERIODICAL , representing what at first might be regarded as a rather narrow range of interests , but which is easily demonstrated to be the very reverse of narrow , is `` The Newarker , '' now widely and favor - ably known as ' ' the house organ of the
Newark	LOCATION	1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 105 Free Public Library . ''

		A recent issue , con - taining articles on civic beauty , clay and its uses , old
New Jersey	LOCATION	pottery , and other sub - jects less distantly related to library work , has also an editorial utterance in able and ener - getic defence of the periodical 's liberal policy in relation to printable matter .

		So admirable in its make-up -LRB- its typography , paper , illus - trations , and general attractiveness -RRB- is `` The Newarker , '' that one is glad to aid in giving further currency to its editor 's enlightened views in respect to library publications .

		Of his own monthly periodical he truly says that it `` does not to most libraries look like the publication of a library , its organ and pro- moter .

		This is because most libraries do not realize that a new day of print is upon us ; that their books and journals may continue to be used to ' broaden , ' to ' uplift , ' to ' spiritual - ize , ' to entertain , to refresh and to wait upon scholarship , and yet may at the same time be useful to the tinker , the tailor , the candle - stick-maker , the brick-layer , the salesman and the farmer , in their homely tasks of earning a living , finding a market and cheapening their products ... THE NEWARKER goes against library traditions in the things which it prints , '' as the briefest glance at its varied pages will show ; and this is well , for perhaps there is no set of traditions that can so well endure a little courageous smashing as the traditions of the public library .

		AIDS TO CULTURE , of a less doubtful efficacy than modern warfare , received timely con - sideration the other day from Professor
Henri Liehtenberger	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	exchange professor , at the third meeting of the
Alliance Franchise	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		European culture was his theme , which he admitted might be thought a rather inopportune subject to discuss at this time when national sentiment and national ideals are so predominant over any larger and more inclusive conceptions .

		But even now the European nations are betraying their uneasy consciousness of not being , any one of them , wholly sufficient unto itself .

		The belligerent states thirst for the approval of their neutral neighbors .

		Among the factors contributing to a more enlightened European culture the speaker named the development of rational science , whether historical or natural , to which all large universities lend a helping hand , and the promotion of a higher civilization through commerce .

		Stress was laid upon the need of developing a European spirit , as distinct from a national spirit .

		Why not aim rather at a cosmopolitan spirit and a world culture ?

		Asiatic and European ideals are sure to clash if each continent remains content to develop a culture exclusively adapted to its own tastes and needs .

		In violent contrast with the French savant 's liberal programme for all
Europe	LOCATION	stands the recent utterance of a Prus - sian publicist ,
Herr Maximilian Harden	PERSON	, who makes bold to declare : `` We do not stand before the judgment seat of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		We acknowledge no such jurisdiction .

		Our might shall create a new law in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is Ger - many that strikes .

		When she has conquered new domains for her genius , then the priest - hoods of all the gods will praise the god of war . ''

		What a departure , in this representa - tive of modern
Germany	LOCATION	, or of a certain part of it , from the aims and ideals of Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	and Lessing !

		* LITERARY LIKINGS OF THE SERIOUS
VERMONT	LOCATION	- ERS come interestingly to view in the `` Tenth Biennial Report of the
Free Public Library Commission of the State of Vermont	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		With only two decades of organized library effort to look back upon , the
Green Mountain	ORGANIZATION	people already have 198 free libraries , twenty-seven not free , and 267 stations to which travelling libraries are sent , so that only twenty-nine towns remain unprovided with library facili - ties of some sort , and only fifty have no per - manent libraries .

		In the record of travelling collections of books it is noteworthy that
thirty-six per cent	MONEY	of the adult reading is of the class known as non-fiction , while the juvenile reading of a similar serious character attains the handsome total of fifty-six per cent .

		The average of non-fiction circulation in pub - lie libraries is supposed to be about twenty - five per cent .

		Thus the Vermonters show themselves to be considerably less frivolous than the majority of their fellow-countrymen , and the
Vermont	LOCATION	children far less light - minded than their elders .

		But the tremen - dous seriousness of childhood is proverbial everywhere .

		In fact , the theory was long ago advanced by certain wise men of the East that , whereas the body is born young and grows every year older , the soul is born old and gains in youthfulness with the passage of time .

		Hence , doubtless , our devotion to ephemeral fiction in our toothless and tottering old age .

		HUMORS OF THE ADVERTISING PAGE come nowhere more frequently or more amusingly to notice than in the columns of the sober and sedate
London	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		Some weeks ago that journal published an advertisement in - serted by a gentleman who signified his will - ingness to accept the free use of a touring car and accompanying chauffeur for week-end excursions as a restorative from exhausting labors in connection with the present interna - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	tional conflict .

		And now a more recent issue contains this specimen of advertising humor : `` Gentleman , 30 , perfect health , magnificent physique , absolutely fit , offers himself for vivisection experiments to any one who would care to infect him with complaint known as the embarrassment of riches . ' '

		One is tempted to search for the motive that prompts these anonymous and obviously futile exhibitions of facetiousness at a considerable cost to the humorist himself .

		It must be a purely artis - tic impulse , a love of art for art 's sake , an irre - sistible desire to cut an intellectual caper , just as the armadillo and the wombat are known to execute in the night solitudes certain ridicu - lous gambols that serve no purpose whatever except to give a moment 's free play to the animal 's creative instincts as an artist in antics .

		It is the innate necessity of self - expression in each case .

		AN EDITORIAL RETROSPECT of a not ungrati - fying character is indulged in by `` Public Libraries '' on the occasion of its entrance upon its twentieth year of increasing use - fulness .

		When that excellent monthly was started there was , says its editor , `` but one other periodical devoted exclusively to library matters , '' and the new venture was regarded as extremely hazardous .

		But the magazine has handsomely vindicated its right to exist - ence , and has doubtless served to encourage the founding of the now sufficiently numerous kindred publications that were not dreamt of twenty years ago .

		In library development it has witnessed the increase of states giving aid to library extension from a meagre two or three to a widely beneficent thirty-seven .

		Not more than half a dozen library associations had struggled into being when ' ' Public Libra - ries '' drew its first breath ; now there are seventy such local organizations with an esti - mated membership of more than six thousand .

		In fact , the great things and the new things that have come to pass in the library world within the lifetime of this monthly survey of that world are far too numerous to mention ' ' all of which , ' ' it might , in classic phrase , not immodestly add , `` I saw , and a part of which I was . ''

		LUMBER-CAMP LIBRARIES FOR
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	fol - low quite promptly the establishment of such antidotes to ennui in the forests of
Minnesota	LOCATION	.

		Of course these libraries have no costly and permanent
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	buildings ; indeed they have no buildings at all , but are housed in boxes that travel thither and yon as need re - quires .

		It is said by those who have had expe - rience in supplying literature to the `` lumber jacks '' that many of these artisans in timber are men of education , and they all prefer good books to trash .

		There is a tradition of a cer - tain lumber camp where the hunger for read - ing-matter was so gnawing that a stray copy of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' was thumbed un - til its contents were committed to memory .

		On the other hand , the cheap illustrated magazines are commonly rejected with dis - gust by the sturdy axemen .

		The ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' invites the assistance of public libraries in that
State	ORGANIZATION	in supplying books and periodicals for the lumber camp travelling libraries .

		Communications should be sent to the
Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	at
Madi	PERSON	- son , and it is safe to infer that even assistance from beyond the borders of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	would not be unwelcome .

		THE INCREASING COST OF CULTURE , or at least of the culture bearing the college or university label , is unmistakably indicated by the an - nouncement , in President
Lowell	PERSON	's latest annual report , of a considerable deficit in the year 's finances at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and in his recom - mendation of an increase in the rate of tuition .

		Several professors have generously returned their year 's salaries to the treasurer , while others have relinquished a part of their pay .

		The president is said to have handed back his salary in full .

		Significant at this time is the report of the
Massachusetts Board of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , just sent in , advising against the found - ing of a
State	ORGANIZATION	university a project for some time under consideration but suggesting as a less expensive partial substitute for such action the annual appropriation of a certain sum for scholarships for deserving pupils in the existing colleges and universities and tech - nical schools of the commonwealth .

		The cost of higher education throughout the country has greatly increased since many , not yet old , received their college diplomas ; but this is only another phase of the increased cost of living .

		COMMUNICATIONS . ''

		GEEMAN '' AND `` AMERICAN . ''

		-LRB- To the - Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr. 0 .

		E. Leasing asks a series of questions in your issue of
February 1	DATE	, to which I beg to be allowed a partial response .

		In his introduction to these questions , Mr.
Lessing	PERSON	announces himself to be '' a plain American citizen of German descent '' ; I , using the words in precisely the sense in which Mr.
Lessing	PERSON	uses them , am a still plainer American citizen of American descent , as are rather more than fifty millions of my countrymen .

		By that I mean to say that , just as Mr.
Lessing	PERSON	points with pride to a father or grandfather born in
Germany	LOCATION	, so do I and the fifty million others like me point
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL with pride to a grandfather 's grandfather who fought for American independence against a Ger - man king who was endeavoring to foist ideas upon
England	LOCATION	, and so upon
America	LOCATION	, which bear a marked family resemblance in method and content to the ideas which
Germany	LOCATION	is seeking to intrude at this moment upon
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		The difference in point of view between us is a remarkable one , and one which most Americans of ancestry and habits of thought similar to mine could not have been convinced existed
eight months ago	DATE	.

		The chief difference , it seems to me , lies in the fact that there is no phase of the present war which we Americans are viewing with a European squint ; there are few phases of it which the Ger - mans in
America	LOCATION	are viewing with an American squint .

		Note that I do not say '' German - Americans . ''

		William the
Greatest	ORGANIZATION	settled that bit of bastardy once and for all . ''

		Germans I know , '' he said , `` and Americans I know ; but I do not know German-Americans . ''

		I see no use in pre - tending to be more German than
William the Greatest	LOCATION	; I merely assert that I and those like me are Americans .

		This brings me to the first question : '' What does the ' Declaration of Independence ' mean ?

		Independence of English rule or German rule ? ''

		The answer is rather pitifully obvious : Indepen - dence of both English and German rule , even though an English king was attempting to enforce upon the freeborn Englishmen of the old colonies ideas which were no more characteristically Ger - man then than they are at this moment .

		Read the Declaration .

		It is directed against whom ?

		Until the next paragraph before the last it speaks of one individual only , '' the present King of Great Brit - ain . ''

		And who was he ?


George III.	PERSON	, of German descent so pure that one has to go back seven generations to find a suspicion of contaminating '' Anglo-Saxon '' blood .

		His government of the colonies was typically German , as exemplified in the government of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	to-day gov - ernment without representation .

		The friends of the rebelling Americans were , quite characteris - tically , the English Whigs , political ancestors of the Liberal party which found itself compelled to declare war against
Germany	LOCATION
last August	DATE	.

		The friends of
George III.	PERSON	, quite characteristically , were those obliging fellow German sovereigns who lent him their soldiers to put down the American rebellion , when free Englishmen refused to recruit his armies for service against us .

		Read from as obvious a source as the
Encyclopaedia Britannica	LOCATION	, a paragraph about
George III	PERSON	.

		: '' He would have given
England	LOCATION	that dangerous position of supremacy which was gained for
France	LOCATION	by
Lewis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, and by
Napoleon	PERSON	in the nineteenth century .

		He would have made his country still more haughty and arrogant than it was , till other nations rose against it , fis they have three times risen against
France	LOCATION	, rather than submit to the intolerable yoke . ''

		Has not this a certain familiar sound ?

		What Americans fought for and what the Declaration of Independence sets forth is the ideal of the English - speaking peoples , and not the ideals of any of the German-speaking peoples made effective in history .

		It is the world-old conflict between that fine old Bourbon maxim , even more effective in
Germany	LOCATION	in the twentieth century than it was in the eighteenth , '' Everything for the people , nothing by the people '' ; and the English maxim finally crystallized in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's `` A government of the people , for the people , by the people . ''

		It is the difference exemplified between the governments of the English-speaking peoples and of the German - speaking people to-day , whether , as
Jefferson	LOCATION	, author of the Declaration , said , governors are to be in moral fear of the governed , or the governed in physical fear of their governors .

		We Amer - icans owe much to
England	LOCATION	and English laws and ideals .

		We owe much to Americans like
Francis Lieber	PERSON	and
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, who chanced to be of German birth , and to the immigrants of '48 and
' 49	DATE	, who rebelled against the Prussian and other German constitutions of that day , which stand practically unchanged at the present moment .

		But we have no criticism quite as effective as the pres - ence in this free country of what we are told are twenty-five millions of Germans the greater the number the more effective the criticism who are here because life was unendurable to them in the Fatherland .

		Moreover , we expect many more mil - lions to add to the weight of this criticism and bring it down to date when this frantic war is over .

		We Americans find ourselves criticized for our Americanism by certain of these transplanted but unrooted Germans , chiefly in periodicals mori - bund or non-existent at the opening of the war .

		These find it logical to offset their devotion to German governmental ideals as exemplified by
William the Greatest	ORGANIZATION	by savage criticism of Amer - ican government as exemplified by the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, a Jefferson-minded man ; apparently unaware that the very freedom of the press they are exercising makes possible their live - lihood here as against life in jail and suppression of their organs in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		We can at least wel - come their appreciation of their new opportuni - ties and their quickness in taking advantage of it .

		But we are inclined to resent any implication that we as Americans would leap to the command of a British official , as so many Germans in this coun - try have come to heel at hearing their master 's voice echo through Dr.
Richard Dernburg	PERSON	; and many of us have read Dr.
Dernburg	PERSON	's arguments in favor of mental reservations in oaths , or of ends justifying means , with a curiously baffled sense that those questions were disposed of in the English-speaking world during the reigns of the Stuarts .

		Coming to Mr.
Lessing	PERSON	's second question , it seems easy enough to admit that
England	LOCATION	, rather than
Germany	LOCATION	, has wronged
Ireland	LOCATION	in the past , but it still appears to us that this is largely due to the fact that
Germany	LOCATION	had no chance ; surely
England	LOCATION	may plead Home Rule in extenuation .

		But again En - gland can plead the results to-day in justification more or less complete .

		She has no frightful slaughters on her mind like that of the Hereros in German
Southwest Africa	LOCATION	, nor exhibitions of Scbrecklichkeit such as were given by the German expeditionary force in
China	LOCATION	.

		Parenthetically it may be observed that Americans , fighting Indian savages across a continent , have been familiar with this particular quality in warfare since the first settlements , just as
Ross	PERSON	's destruction of the Con - gressional Library in
Washington	LOCATION	in the reign of
George III	ORGANIZATION	.

		lent us comprehension of Belgian feel - ing , when the
Louvain	LOCATION	library was fed to the flames .

		American 's are able to see a vital difference between British '' navalism '' and German mili - tarism , responding to the fourth question , '' Who controls the sea ? ''

		We see
Germany	LOCATION	, for exam - ple , quite as infected with '' navalism '' as
Great Britain	LOCATION	, while
Great Britain	LOCATION	was hardly touched by militarism at all before the outbreak of the war , as unexpected by Britons as almost complete unpreparedness proves it to have been .

		We see , too , that the navy of

		If it is an evil , it is at worst a cutaneous one , not a cancer eating out the nation 's vitals .

		Furthermore , the position of the British ; Isles makes starvation only too easy without con - trol of the seas , while

		But , just as the question was about to be settled to that effect , the German govern - ment/proclaimed all food supplies as the property , of the .

		State , leaving discrimination between food , for civilians and food for the military impossible .

		Finally , it may be urged that
Great Britain	LOCATION	's con - trol of the sea has been beneficent , with that per - fect restraint which comes with accustomed power , ever since
America	LOCATION	gaye up its control of the seas after , the Civil War ; while there is nothing in German history ; since

		I have no doubt that Mr.

		When German scholarship is not speaking about mili - tarism and its consequences , it is generally right .

		Every American must regret that any German can , sneer at Anglo-Saxonry with a good con - science .

		We find it occasion for pride that we belong to a great family of self-governing nations framed upon Anglo-Saxon ideas of individual rights and constitutional liberty , hardly touched at all until this war began with militarism and lax conceptions of treaty obligations .

		We take no less pride in a mighty literature which embodies these ideas and ideals , and has seldom been false to them at any point ; and we should like to have the Ger - mans proud of them , too , as we are proud of

		`` LITERARY '' VERSUS `` COMMERCIAL '' DRAMA .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		.

		Your recent criticism of an article by Mr.
W. C. de Mille	PERSON	in the
January	DATE	'' Yale Review '' puts sev - eral questions to Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	as to his conclusions about our '' commercial '' drama .

		I should like to go a step farther and ask a question about his premises .

		What does he mean by '' commercial '' drama anyway ; and how , according to his defini - tion , does it differ from that which he patroniz - ingly refers to as '' literary '' ?

		All through his article , we find assumed , a distinction between the two forms , and always to the discredit of the lat - ter .

		What , then , are the requirements that Mr , de Mille makes for the '' commercial '' play ?

		On looking through the article , we find that the '' com - mercial '' play must provide '' entertainment , '' must '' tell a story which finds its best expression through acting ' ; ; it must be '' a splendid piece of craftsmanship '' ; it must '' reflect to a large degree the point of view of its audience '' and '' get its hands on their hearts . ''

		Now by a strange coinci - dence , these and no others have always been considered the requirements of the '' literary '' play , which Mr. de Mille nowhere clearly defines .

		Thus we may conclude that , under favorable cir - cumstances , '' commercial '' drama and '' literary '' drama are one , or rather become one through the simple medium of the box-office .

		That these favorable circumstances once existed as they do not exist to-day , no student of stage history would deny .

		In Elizabethan
London	LOCATION	, prices of theatre seats were such that the drama was indeed a `` democratic '' art ; and , further , no despotic cen - sor or trust magnate intervened between public and playwright .

		This was the great period of the ; lit - erary play , which , because it met the requirements of '' commercial '' drama , drew crowded houses .

		On the other hand , when we get down to the early part of the nineteenth century in
England	LOCATION	, we find that the '' literary '' play and the '' commer - cial '' play have become two different things , not necessarily through any fault of either public or dramatist , but through the outside interference of official censor and theatrical manager .

		On the commercial side , we have tawdry stage successes which would not at all answer Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	's re - quirements for '' commercial '' drama , in that , for one thing , they fail signally to reflect the viewpoint of the great era succeeding the French Revolution .

		On the literary side , we have the closet-dramas of
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, which , although they breathe the fiery spirit of the social awakening , do not wholly obey generally accepted laws of technique .

		Let us hope that the time is approaching when '' literary '' drama and '' commercial '' drama will again be one .

		Perhaps Mr.
de Mille	PERSON	means to prophesy this when in the cause of the '' commer - cial '' play , he appropriates all the '' literary '' play 's qualities .

		If this is so , one can only say that he appears to be confusing the issue when he exalts '' commercial '' drama thus endowed to so high a seat and leaves '' literary '' drama , thus robbed and stripped , to lie by the roadside .

		* An autobiography richer in varied interest , more diversified with pictures of life amid all sorts of surroundings and in many dissimilar fields of activity , and in the rehearsing of it re-lived with keener zest and , if one may add it without offence , greater complacency , of a justifiable sort , than the life-story of Dr.
John Allan Wyeth	PERSON	, is .

		not offered to the reader every month in the year or every year in the century .

		`` With
Sabre	ORGANIZATION	and Scalpel '' he calls this `` autobiography of a soldier and sur - geon , ' ' but in addition to his dashing exploits as a Confederate trooper in the
Fourth Ala	LOCATION	- bama Cavalry , and his subsequent notable achievements in medicine and surgery , he has been a farmer , woodsman , cotton-planter , cattle-buyer , river-pilot , telegraph-operator , land-speculator , building contractor , lecturer in his profession , twice president of the
New York Academy of Medicine	ORGANIZATION	, founder of the
New York Polyclinic School and Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, which is the first institution of its kind in this country to offer post-graduate courses , and author of numerous works both of tech - nical and more general interest , including a life of General
Nathan B. Forrest	PERSON	and an his - torical sketch of the settlement of

		No mean talent is his also for the turning of graceful verse , as he is pleased to remind the reader by appending to his latest book a half - score of what may be styled occasional pieces , some if not all of which have already seen the light in magazines or elsewhere .

		If it be per - missible , for variety 's sake , to give the present review a certain topsy-turviness , let us begin by bespeaking the reader 's favorable opinion of Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	the poet , and to this end quoting from his appendix the first stanza of some animated and pleasing verses that may be read in full in
Bryant	PERSON	's `` New Library of Poetry and Song . ''

		They are entitled `` My Sweetheart 's Face , '' and begin , with rather original as well as felicitous imagery , as follows : '' My kingdom is my sweetheart 's face .

		And these the boundaries I trace : Northward her forehead fair ; Beyond a wilderness of auburn hair ; A rosy cheek to east and west ; Her little mouth The sunny south , It is the south that I love best . ''

		interest one in his other than poetic capaci - ties , may not unreasonably be assumed .

		And other things are not unequal , for the same impress of a distinctive personality stamps itself on all his heterogeneous activities and saves his recital from any touch of triteness or monotony .

		A rather sure index to a man 's character is commonly thought to be found by a study of the mother 's mental and moral endowment .

		Therefore it may be possible to throw a sidelight if not a full-face flash of illumination on the subject of our inquiry by relating in the author 's own words the story of how he `` discovered '' his maternal parent when he was well advanced in his seventh year .

		`` The discovery came about in - this fashion : a boy playmate lost his temper at something that happened between us , and in anger gave me a slap which I did not resent .

		At this juncture I heard a voice from a near-by window , and , turning , I saw my mother leaning out , her eyes flashing s6 that I could almost see the sparks flying and her cheeks as red as fire .

		.

		In a tone about which there could be no misinterpretation , even by one who instinctively preferred peace to war , she asked me if the boy struck me in anger ; and when I told her he had , she blazed up and said , ` And you did n't hit him back ? '

		My response was that father had told me it was wrong to fight , and that when another boy gave way to anger just to tell him it was wrong and not fight back .

		At this the blue bonnet of Clan -
Allan	PERSON	-LSB- the mother 's maiden name -RSB- went ' over the border , ' and she fairly screamed : ' I do n't care what your father told you ; if you do n't whip that boy this minute I 'll whip you ! '

		And she looked on , and was satisfied when it was over .

		I date my career from that eventful day ; for I had come to the parting of the ways . ''

		Thus sprung of Old Testament and New Testament parentage , so to speak , the Ala - bama boy , who was sixteen years old when the Civil War broke out , yielded to the prompt - ings of the less pacific strain in his blood and soon , with his noble mare , Fanny ^ whose sad end forms a touching episode in the narrative , joined a troop of cavalry and played a spir - ited if inconspicuous part in the national drama before he was taken prisoner in the
autumn of 1863	DATE	and confined for a year and a half at
Camp Morton	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, after which there was no more fighting for him to do .

		Not to convey a false impression of the pacific father , it should be added that even his dis - inclination to violence did not keep him at home when the call to arms reached him .

		As a matter of fact , he was earlier in the field than his son .

		Interesting and enlightening are the views which this loyal Southerner takes of sundry questions that once were burning issues be - 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	tween the North and the South .

		His pictures of the negro slave 's not unhappy lot , of the evils of abolitionism , of the splendid patriot - ism of those to whom state rights meant more than national unity , and of southern condi - tions in general as he intimately knew them , are not to be passed over with cursory and unsympathetic glance , whatever the reader 's preconceptions and predilections .

		From the opening pages of the book the following vehement utterance may be taken as char - acteristic and significant : '' I am firmly convinced that if instead of the nagging , irritating , insulting , and finally insurrec - tionary and murderous meddlesomeness of the Northern abolitionists , the conservative and better portion had united in earnest and friendly co - operation with their brothers of the South , who proved their zeal and devotion to principle by the wholesale sacrifice of wealth and ease , the humane scheme of emancipation and colonization as set forth in the '
Virginia	LOCATION	Resolutions ' would have been carried out and chattel slavery would have disappeared by peaceful means . ''

		In a subsequent chapter we find the portrait of that hero of anti-slavery days ,
John Brown	PERSON	, drawn with no flattering touches .

		The fea - tures are delineated with strokes like this : '' Out of this turmoil emerged a weird , red - handed specter in human form whose name but for his lawless deeds in
Kansas	LOCATION	would never have crossed the boundaries of that fair State had he not become the agent in one of the most nefarious plots recorded in history .

		A group of men of intelligence , position , and wealth aided him in the armed invasion of a peaceful and law-abiding com - munity .

		Brown 's purpose was the treasonable capture of the
United States	LOCATION	arsenal and the appropriation of government property to an un - lawful purpose , the robbery of the houses of law - abiding citizens , and murder .

		He sought to incite a wide-spread slave insurrection and the consequent massacre of thousands of helpless women and chil - dren .

		This wicked deed , known as the '
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry Raid , ' made secession possible and brought on tbe Civil War . ''

		No gleam of admiration for a martyr 's hero - ism is to be discerned in the glowing terms with which the author paints the deeds of this remarkable man .

		On another page he further writes in his dispraise that `` having failed at every one of a half-dozen different vocations to make a living for his family and himself , a rolling stone so mossless that at the age of fifty-five he was absolutely bankrupt in fortune , and no less so in honorable reputa - tion ,
John Brown	PERSON	turned up in
Kansas	LOCATION	in
October , 1855	DATE	, in the role of a professional Free-soil agitator . ''

		If one wishes a view of the
Kansas	LOCATION	occurrences of that day quite dif - ferent from the accepted northern presenta - tion of those historic events , let one read Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	.

		The chapters devoted to memories of the war have the lively interest belonging to all well-written accounts of personal experience in battle and in camp and on the march .

		The narrative of prison life at
Camp Morton	LOCATION	has the one fault of brevity , which can not be said of the author 's term of imprisonment itself .

		A larger view of things military is found in the portion of the book devoted to the battle of
Chickamauga	LOCATION	, where the author indulges in speculation as to what might have been . ' '

		In my opinion , ' ' he says , ' ' the South - ern Confederacy was won here by desperate valor and lost by the failure of the command - ing general to appreciate the magnitude of his victory and to take advantage of the great opportunity which was his for the capture or destruction of the entire
Union	ORGANIZATION	army in
Georgia	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	.


Chickamauga	LOCATION	, as I interpret it from personal observation and from careful study , marked the high tide of the Confederacy . ''

		Making an abrupt transition now , let us get a glimpse of Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	in one of his many non-military aspects .

		Toward the end of his book , where the practice of medicine supplants the sterner occupations of war , he shows him - self interestingly in a character not unlike that of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	.

		After relating a Holmes-like incident in Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's professional experience , he details a similar occurrence in his own . ''

		Spending the
summer	DATE	near
New York	LOCATION	, I made it the rule to be in my office in the city at a certain hour on two days of each week .

		As I was nearing my door I noticed a man a few feet ahead of me who turned to ring my bell .

		He had on a long frock-coat which fitted well and wore a soft felt hat .

		At first glance I took him to be from the South ; but as he was pulling at the bell-knob , he having not yet seen me , I noticed on the rim of one ear a well-marked epithelioma , a form of cancer which occurs only after frost-bite .

		I then placed him from the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, for his coat and hat were not of the
East	LOCATION	.

		As I came up the stoop just behind him I said , ' You want to see Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	? '

		He turned quickly and said , ' Yes . '

		I continued in an off-hand manner as I was getting my key into the lock and not looking toward him , ` About that cancer ? '

		He said , ' Yes . ' '

		From the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	? '

		` Yes . '

		`
Nebraska	LOCATION	or
Iowa	LOCATION	? '

		` Why ?

		Iowa ! ' '

		What regiment did you serve in during the war ? '

		-LRB- He had a small
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	button on the lapel of his coat collar . -RRB- '

		I was major of the Thir - teenth
Iowa	LOCATION	. '

		... By this time we were standing within the hallway , and he said : ` All right ; but before we go any further I 'd like to know how much you will charge me for the operation . '

		I told him ; and then he exclaimed : ' Well , my goodness !

		What kind of a man are you , anyway ?

		You never saw me before in your life ; you knew I was looking for you ; knew what was the matter with me ; knew what state I was from ; knew I
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , in was in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army ; and d me if you have n't named exactly the amount I made up my mind to pay for the operation . ' ''

		Thus having , it is hoped , indicated in some measure what kind of a man Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	is , and stirred some interest in the book that pre - sents him more in detail and with far greater fidelity , the reviewer will close with a word of commendation for the attractive appearance of the autobiography .

		Its matter is enter - tainingly and conveniently grouped in two - score chapters or more , with an abundance of pictorial accompaniment , including two por - traits of the author at widely separated periods in his life and a process-print repro - duction of his bust , recently unveiled at the
Polyclinic Hospital	ORGANIZATION	which he founded .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		ART HISTORY .

		* `` My desire , '' writes Mr.
Lisle March Phil	PERSON	- lipps , in his book on `` Art and Environment , '' `` has been to confine myself to the considera - tion of art as an expression of human life and character .

		Selecting some of the great periods , or creative epochs , in the art of the world , I have endeavoured to deduce from them the dis - tinguishing qualities , limitations , and points of view of the races which produced them . ''

		These , Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	thinks , are revealed chiefly by architecture , and only secondarily by sculpture and painting and such minor arts as furniture-making ; consequently he devotes the bulk of his book to an interpretation of various architectures .

		Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's treatment is both lively and persuasive .

		Like all intelligent persons , he has strong preferences and reasons for them that he believes in , so that his epithets for what he dislikes are striking , even though his com - mendations of what he prefers do not appear excessive .

		So far as we are aware , no one since
Taine	PERSON	has expounded with so much vigor and good sense any phase of the principle that works of art are to be understood in terms of race , time , and place .

		On the whole , Mr.
Phil	PERSON	- lipps succeeds in ignoring time and place , par - ticularly when considering those types of art that have his approval ; environment seems to matter chiefly in determining the works of the Egyptians , the Arabs , and the eighteenth cen - tury aristocratic French , which he dislikes .

		An innocent reader is led to wonder why the word `` environment '' and not `` race , '' ap - pears in the title ; all the more , in view of the author 's avowed intention to deduce the quali - ties of races from their gesthetic creations .

		* ART AND ENVIRONMENT .

		vised edition .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Re - Soon , however , the reader begins to wonder whether `` race '' would have been the better term .

		He observes the whole book permeated by another and more general distinction , a distinction based on the presence of certain qualities of the human spirit , and transverse to the distinctions of race .

		The qualities are notably intellectuality and passionate energy .

		With them , he finds , Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	coordinates aesthetic traits .

		Thus , predominant horizon - tality in architectural line is said to reveal intellectuality in the people that use it , while predominant verticality or obliquity is said to reveal energy .

		The one is the expression or effect of the other , so that Greek and Renais - sance builders built as they did because they were intellectual ; and they were intellectual because they built as they did .

		And Arabs and Goths built as they did because they were energetic ; and they were energetic because they built as they did .

		This is the skeleton of Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's `` deduction '' !

		With it the division of mankind into races is superseded by the division of mankind into psychological groups , sub-intellectual , intellectual , and post-intellectual : the qualities of the arts be - come coordinated with these qualities of mind ; the monotony of the Egyptian , the energy and elan of Arabian , the activity of the Gothic with the sub - or un-intellectual ; the unity and definiteness of the Greek and the Renaissance with the intellectual ; the realism and expres - siveness of Hellenistic sculpture and Renais - sance sculpture and painting , intent on catching the fleeting details of expression with `` spiritual emotion '' which is post-intellectual .

		And there you are !

		As a `` deduction , '' Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's argu - ment begs the question .

		But whatever may be said of his argument as a deduction , nothing but good can be said of it as an interpretative vision of life and art .

		Indeed , he might retort that in this field all arguments beg the ques - tion , since they are really nothing more than an exhibition of analogies and similarities which are identical only to belief , and depend for their force on persuasiveness rather than on logical cogency .

		And we must grant that we have read nothing in recent years that ex - hibits so persuasively the opinion that race , human quality , rather than time and place is , in art , the dominant agency of control and creation .

		If , very frequently , other factors , particularly environment , seem to displace race in his account , the displacement should be credited , not to Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's inadvertence or fallibility , but to his unusual intellectual honesty , the rarest thing in `` art-criticism , '' and his eagerness to tell the truth as he sees it .

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	What is the truth which he sees ?

		The great tradition of the Occident has its historic roots in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	begins , therefore , with the analysis of Egyptian art .

		The Egyp - tians , in his opinion , were sub-intellectual .

		Theirs was a case of arrested development , arrested by the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		The river 's monotonous routine held them until their life and its changes flowed as one ; it fixed their habits , dominated their thoughts , and ordained their behavior .

		Victims no less than beneficiaries of their environment , they manifested its overwhelming influence on them nowhere so clearly as in their art .

		This is seen to be as unvaried as the Nilotic floods , whose vegeta - tion supplies them with their model for orna - ment and design , a perennial repetition of the primitive same , a childish reproduction of forms not seen but recollected as a child recol - lects , an accumulative repetition and reproduc - tion , technically perfected through practice , spiritually inane .

		`` Perfect yet primitive , young yet old , its hoary infancy defies time .

		It is the image of routine , of deadly monotony and unthinking iteration . ' '

		To this ' ' hoary infancy ' ' Greek art presents an absolute contrast .

		Natural , observant , realistic , its essence is intellectuality , and in - tellectuality of a unique sort .

		Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	describes realism as an expression of intellec - tuality ; for intellectuality is definitive , and realism defines .

		Sculpture is , he thinks , uniquely the art of the Greeks because ' ' sculp - ture is definition .

		The sculptor undertakes to express his ideas in a hard material , in curt , distinct lines , in concrete and exactly articu - lated forms . ''

		Hence his themes are neces - sarily ' ' finite ' ' ; his art refuses , if he is a. Greek , to deal with the unknown ; it can not express `` spiritual emotion '' -LRB- whatever that may be -RRB- ; it is , for example , incapable of treating death as the Christian treats it .

		It is marked by limitations , as is all intellectuality ; and this mark pervades the whole spiritual content of Greek life , no less than its representative art .

		The limitation of Greek spirit differs from that of the other intellectualist races of
Europe	LOCATION	in a particular way , however .

		It is unique , and its uniqueness springs from the fact that the Greeks were an eye-minded peo - ple .

		In them the faculty and preferences of seeing infected and suffused the residuum of consciousness .

		Consequently , the needs of the eye determine for them the principles of life and art ; nay , life is art , and the consumma - tion of art the inspiration of life .

		In the Doric temple the Greek genius expresses itself with organic completeness .

		The laws of vision de - termine the details of its construction , and the construction is such that it is abstract , inde - pendent of time and place , self-containing and self-contained , unvaried and unvarying through the ages , like a syllogism , or a god of the Epicureans .

		This self-sufficiency , this `` unity and repose , '' are ordained by the eye 's inertia and attained by the harmonious devel - opment of a central structural theme .

		It is most conspicuous where the theme is un -
Hellenic	LOCATION	; consequently , to see the essence of the Greek mind in architecture , see it as it handles the Roman arch in the church of
S. Sophia	LOCATION	.

		That is the tour de force of the logical Greek genius .

		This summary falls , we are afraid , far short of justice to Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's brilliant chapters on the Greeks .

		Perhaps this is because we can not help being quite as much impressed by what they fail to say as by what they say .

		They make no mention of the possible influ - ence of an immemorial environment , of an in - tense and even feverish social activity during the most brilliant period of Greek history , of possible imitative response and compensatory reaction to nature and society .

		Yet can it be that the Greek eye learned nothing from the sharp , clean outlines of the low Greek hills against the intensely blue Greek skies , from the barren landscapes definite as silhouettes in outlining the low and almost geometric for - estation ?

		Why should the Greek have been less susceptible to definiteness and articula - tion in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's shapes than the Egyptian to the rank jungles and tepid hazes of the Nilotic lotos-land which were
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's face to him ?

		And is it quite logical to say that the Greek was eye-minded because he built Doric temples as he built them , and then to say that he built Doric temples in the lovely Doric manner be - cause he was eye-minded ?

		On the contrary , the strenuosity of Greek life , its athleticism and militarism , its emphasis on the impor - tance of music in education , in the significant dynamism attributed by its most representa - tive philosopher ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, to its most charac - teristic philosophic conception , the `` Platonic idea '' -LRB- so distinctly visual a conception to the layman ! -RRB-

		might easily lead to the opinion that the Greek was motor - or muscle-minded , and that his works of art , far from being an expression of his nature , were a compensation for it .

		Just as desires unfulfilled in fact are satisfied in imagination and in dream , so , it may be , a disorganized and embattled state may imagine unity and repose , and a torn mind may dream of peace .

		Such dreams and imaginings , realized in art , are not an ex - pression of a people 's actual character , but rather a compensation for it .

		So , the esthetic mood of a people may be the direct opposite of its natural and political mood , even as the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 vaudevillian tastes of the American man of affairs are the direct opposite of his puri - tanical acquisitiveness and devout republican - ism .

		Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	has not shown that this was not the case with
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Nor , for that matter , is it the case with any of the people he deals with , certainly not with the Arabs , with whose works he next invites our souls .

		Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	offers good reasons for not liking the Arabian creation , but he invokes environment , which with him acts like charity , to cover and explain the mul - titude of its sins .

		The Arab lives in the desert , and his soul reproduces the desert 's traits .

		He is possessed of `` the desert 's fiery elan and restless inconstancy . ''

		His art is `` a strange mingling of frailty , fickleness , and poetic energy , '' which throws together any kind of material in any way that will hold for the moment , which disintegrates the trabeated and arcuated solidities of the Greek and Roman buildings into unstable and fanciful forms , which multiply as the shifting sands of the desert multiply , all to no end .

		The whole of Arab life has the fancifulness and irrelevancy of Arab architecture , its science gets lost in magic , its philosophy in mysticism , its social order in confusion , its military prowess in chaos .

		It is without reason and without con - tinuity , and before these it fades away like a mirage .

		All that Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	says about the Arabs is , we think , true ; but here again the truth is only half-truth .

		What would have been the fate of Arabian civilization if Christian had not conquered Moslem in
Spain	LOCATION	, and Ottoman barbarism had not thrown Arabian culture back to its own level ?

		What is to be said of the persistence of the Arab conversion to Mohammedanism , and the sta - bility and articulation of the new order that revelation prescribed ?

		If Arabian philosophy is predominantly mystical , German is so no less ; and as for fancifulness , the German content may be different , but the irrelevance to reality is the same .

		Mir .

		Phillipps 's account - ing for the Arab in art is beautifully simple , but Arabs are human , and with respect to the characterization of human beings the simple is too near the untrue .

		It becomes dangerously near being identical with the untrue in the discussion of Gothic architecture .

		To explain this , Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	disposes at a swoop of the various alternative accounts of its origin .

		That the conditions of labor determined the material , and the material determined the structural form , he denies ; as he denies its appearance as the solu - tion of the structural problems of Romanesque builders who had difficulty in roofing their naves and aisles .

		Of environment he makes no mention whatsoever .

		The origin of Gothic forms is to be found , he insists , in the genius of the
Goth	ORGANIZATION	, at work in
France	LOCATION	and in En - gland .

		The Goths `` were what they were making . ''

		Their unconscious ideal , when they entered European history , was a life of action .

		`` They valued exclusively , or at least primarily , such qualities as took effect in action . ''

		When in the twelfth century they have become civilized enough to express them - selves consciously in art , the form that comes spontaneously to their hand is the pointed arch .

		This is because the essence of the arch is its energy , it `` never sleeps '' ; the strong `` lateral thrust '' tends to disintegrate it , and it must be repressed by a buttressing and whatnot .

		Gothic , says Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	bril - liantly , is not a style but a fight .

		All of which may be so , and much of which no doubt is so .

		But are the factors which Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	either completely sets aside or ignores deprived of potency because it is so ?

		Is the relation not much more likely to have been reciprocal ?

		After all ,
Gothic	ORGANIZATION	is the solu - tion of a structural problem ; after all , Gothic does make use of small stones because the con - ditions of labor were such as to make this use inevitable .

		These conditions might , of them - selves , have generated the Gothic style : they are sufficient for its origin .

		If , indeed , race alone were potent , North European archi - tecture should still be Gothic .

		In point of fact , the relation is reciprocal : purpose , need , modifies material ; but material , and most par - ticularly in the art of building , limits purpose .

		It is still impossible to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear , while a very excellent one may be made in forms appropriate to pigskin .

		A thousand years hence a Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	of the thirtieth century studying our art of the twen - tieth may point to an exclusive causal connec - tion between American sky-scrapers and the ' ' natural ' ' strenuosity of the American ' ' race . ' '

		On the principle that verticality expresses energy , he might demonstrate that the
United States	LOCATION	of the twentieth century was franti - cally energetic and proportionally irrational .

		He might gather innumerable accessory data from our political and economic life , our re - ligion and our art .

		But he would neglect in all this the real causes of the development of the sky-scraper .

		These are , first of all , the unnaturally high rate of ground-rent in our American cities , and secondly the use of the steel-girder and concrete as the architectural materials .

		Prevented for economic reasons from spreading horizontally , American archi - tecture rises vertically .

		It could not have become vertical without the use of structural steel .

		The limitations of material are ultimate .

		THE DIAI , -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	That Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	knows all this , but is unconscious of it , may be seen in the uncon - scious paradox in which his analysis of the Gothic style culminates .

		The essence of that style is the pointed arch .

		The arch alone , of all architectural forms , is energetic .

		The lateral thrust , pushing outward and down - ward , would unless checked disintegrate , by force of the energy it lets loose .

		Gothic con - struction consists of check and counter-check of this energy .

		Withal , `` it may be we sel - dom enough realize how strenuous and alive are the forces which are here engaged . ''

		It is `` difficult to connect the idea of activity with such rigid immobility . ''

		But the rareness of this realization , the difficulty of this connection , are a rareness and difficulty which depend on a contrast be - tween the structural and cesthetic tendencies of Gothic architecture .

		It is an engineer 's , not an artist 's , analysis of the Gothic arch Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	here gives us ; it has reference to the material .

		An aesthetic analysis would have reference to the form .

		And here the paradox begins to appear .

		For the Gothic form is , as Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	says , an aesthetic expression of energy ; but it is energy in the reverse direction from the structural energy .

		Mechanically , the energy of the arch moves downward and outward : it is the energy of a push or thrust ; festhetically the energy moves upward and outward : it is the energy of a linear pull .

		Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's own language unconsciously expresses this fact .

		`` Gothic has been called the linear type of architecture .

		... The web of interior lines ... seem to uphold the structure ... it is in these that the strength and vigour appear to reside .

		... fit -RSB- is the most recognizable and salient trait of the style .

		These light and sinewy lines pervade the whole structure .

		They dart in sheaves from the floor ... diverge and spread fanlike over the vault-surface ... ' In sum , the total effects is that of a lateral lift .

		Inside , the lines that `` uphold '' `` dart in sheaves from the floor '' ; outside , the shadowed peaks and curves of buttress against arch , and arch against buttress , rising in intricate linear tracings against the sky , what is there in nature for analogue , that might so impress the mind of a people that their own significant building would tend unconsciously to assume its forms ' ?

		What is there but the primeval forest of great trees , whose long , rising shafts are literally an upward lift against a down - ward pull ; literally alive with energy ; whose meeting branches form natural Gothic arches , with intricate traceries in long avenues we have learned from novels to know as Gothic ?

		For generations the northern peoples lived among them and with them , seeing them daily and hourly ,
summer	DATE	and winter , until their generic contours , their dominant shapes , must have become part and parcel of the uncon - scious funded mentality of the race .

		If Egyptian temperament and architectural forms are determined by the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, if Arabian temperament and architectural forms are the effects of the desert , why may not Gothic be the outcome of immemorial association with the primeval forest ?

		But Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	does not even consider this possibility .

		Goth , like Greek , is represented by him as altogether uninfluenced by environment .

		There are many things still to say , if space permitted , about Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	's account of the art of the renaissance and its relation to the recrudescence of intellectuality in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope ; about the influence upon this art of what he calls `` spiritual emotion , '' and its connection with the philosophical ideas of infinity .

		We should like even more to dis - cuss his brilliant and perspicacious chapter on the art of the French aristocracy of the court of Louis XV .

		We should like to show in detail how unified and articulate his view is , a vision , in fact , of the march of history in terms of art .

		We should like to show how , like all things unified , it attains its unity always by minimizing or ignoring factors which an adequate account of art must con - sider ; and how , therefore , one always must agree with Mr.
Phillipps	PERSON	, but agree with reservations .

		One thing , however , readers may agree in without reservation , namely , that in recent years there has appeared no general book on the arts which so well repays the reading .

		SOME AMERICAN DISSENTERS .

		* The capital fact in the political history of the
United States	LOCATION	in the past ten years has been the growth of dissent .

		Not , of course , that dissent was unknown until the fateful days in which we live .

		For there have been many periods in which , in this country as elsewhere , it has flourished .

		It was , indeed , dissent which first gave the nation being .

		And one calls instantly to mind the epoch of Jeffersonian criticism of Federalist adminis - tration , the decades of Abolitionist denuncia - tion of a national government palsied by the grip of the slaveholder , and the Mugwump - Granger-Populist-Socialist era of the eighties and early nineties .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 115 The dissent of the most recent years , how - ever , has been peculiarly comprehensive in its scope , penetrating in its criticism , and relent - less in its methods .

		It began to gather strength even before the turning of the cen - tury .

		It won its earlier triumphs in the estab - lishment here and there of the initiative and the referendum , in the enfranchisement of women in a number of the western states , and in the widespread substitution of the direct primary for the nominating convention .

		It found expression in the rapid growth of trade unionism , socialism , and the demand for in - dustrial democratization .

		It obtained , in time , its most illustrious and influential pro- tagonist in Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		And , finally , it acquired a name to conjure with , namely , progressivism .

		The future historian of our period will have as one of his principal tasks the interpretation of the progressive movement .

		He will have the advantage of a perspective which is , of course , unattainable at the present day .

		In the meantime , we are being supplied with some highly ingenious and interesting , even though tentative and incomplete , interpreta - tions from a group of young and keen students of American society who have been themselves numbered among the sympathizers with , or the active participants in , the movement .

		Conspicuous among these men are Mr.
Croly	PERSON	, Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	, and Mr.
Walling	PERSON	, all of whom , in recent months , have published books de - scriptive of progressivism as they see it .

		Mr.
Croly	PERSON	is concerned chiefly with an explanation of the rise and growth of progressivism , and with a sympathetic exposition of the multifold character which it bears to-day .

		Mr.
Lipp	PERSON	- mann portrays the semi-chaotic state in which the break with the past has involved us , and considers the means by which the sure mas - tery of the people is to be established .

		Mr.
Walling	PERSON	, approaching the subject as a social - ist , seeks to demonstrate that the progressiv - ism of to-day is but a step in the direction of the ultimate social democracy and the social - istic state .

		Mr.
Croly	PERSON	's book must be pronounced a work of first-rate importance .

		It is admirably written , and we are not likely soon to have a discussion of the subject with which it deals that will be better informed , of fairer spirit , or more deeply philosophical .

		It is in no sense a brief for the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	as such .

		The progressivism with which it deals transcends the bounds of party .

		It may be described more nearly as a state of mind than as a party programme , and its antecedents are to be traced to successive stages of the nation 's his - tory from a period as early as that of the formation of the Constitution .

		The fundamental proposition of progressiv - ism , as Mr.
Croly	PERSON	describes it , is that the injustice and wastage of our American indus - trial and social order are too deep-seated to be overcome by ordinary expedients of reform ; and the process by which , as this conviction has grown , reform has given way to insur - gency and insurgency to progressivism is sketched with keen insight into both the psychology and the economic environment of the American people .

		Reforms , whether in the civil service , in municipal politics , or in other branches of public affairs , were always -LRB- so we are told -RRB- half-hearted and ephemeral ; insurgency was largely obstructionist and negative ; only progressivism takes the long view and seeks to build from the foundations .

		There are , Mr.
Croly	PERSON	admits , various brands of progressivism , and the comparison which is drawn between the progressivism of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and that of President
Wilson	PERSON	is illu - minating , if not at every point convincing .

		Roosevelt progressivism , it is admitted , `` can fairly be charged with many ambiguities . ''

		But in one essential respect , it is contended , its meaning is unmistakable .

		`` Its advocates are committed to a drastic reorganization of the American political and economic system , to the substitution of a frank social policy for the individualism of the past , and to the realization of this policy , if necessary , by the use of efficient governmental instruments . ''

		The progressivism of President
Wilson	PERSON	is characterized as `` vague in precisely this essen - tial respect , '' and its vagueness is said to be of a kind that is elusive and secretive rather than merely flexible .

		While Roosevelt progressiv - ism considers the existing order fundamen - tally unsound , so that no mere loppings off here and tonings up there will meet the social need , the tendency of the
Wilson	PERSON	school is to emphasize those aspects of progressivism which `` can be interpreted as the emancipa - tion of an essentially excellent system from corrupting and perverting parasites . ''

		The progressivism which results is scrupulously careful not to be too progressive , and , like the reform movements which have been super - seded , it poses as a `` higher conservatism . ''

		In its emphasis upon the restriction of gov - ernmental regulation , the `` new freedom '' harks back to Jeffersonian individualism .

		It voices no desire `` to substitute for an auto - matic competitive economic regime one in which a conscious social purpose , equipped with an adequate technical method , was to play a decisive part . ''

		Mr.
Croly	PERSON	recognizes that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's version of progressivism , 116 THE DIAL
Feb. 16	DATE	`` whatever its underlying tendency and mean - ing , is a high and serious doctrine , which is the outcome of real elevation of purpose and feeling , and which up to date has had on the whole a beneficial effect on public opinion . ''

		He recognizes , too , that as a matter of prac - tical politics Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, in his capacity of party leader , has been obliged to lay emphasis upon any possible analogies between pro- gressivism and the historic tradition of his party .

		He feels , none the less , that the Presi - dent 's progressivism has in too large a degree the backward look .

		It is not a new birth of public spirit ; it is a rebirth .

		It is not an awakening of public opinion to something novel ; it is a reawakening .

		It is not aiming at an unprecedented vitalizing of democracy , but at its revival along traditional lines .

		Were it not for the trammels of his party and official connections , Mr.
Croly	PERSON	suggests , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	would probably place the emphasis differently .

		But as it is , his progressivism must be adjudged partial , halting , and inade - quate to meet the needs of the times .

		Mr.
Croly	PERSON	recognizes the value of the con - servative spirit in a society , and he freely admits the general sincerity of that portion of the American people which is , whether or not it calls itself such , conservative .

		He agrees that men can not reasonably be expected to break with an old system until they can see what is to be put in its place .

		The providing of a substitute for the existing order in the
United States	LOCATION	is the peculiar and indispensa - ble task of progressivism ; and not merely a new order , but a new faith , `` upon the rock of which may be built a better structure of indi - vidual and social life . ''

		The object of the present volume is to consider `` whether any substitute is needed for the traditional system , and whether progressivism offers any prospect of living up to the manifest requirements of the part . ''

		The answer to both questions is , of course , affirmative ; and whatever one 's opinion of the conclusions reached , it must be conceded that the spirit in which the inquiry is made is altogether commendable .

		The vital defect of the existing system is conceived to be the indirectness of popular control over the national government .

		The Constitution is too difficult to amend ; the workings of the government are controlled too much by legalism rather than by the public will ; the courts have become the irresponsible interpreters of the Constitution , and therefore the irresponsible makers of law under the Constitution .

		The best , and only real , remedy is declared to be direct government by the people , `` entered into with wisdom and cau - tion . ''

		That direct government taking ex - pression chiefly in the initiative , the referen - dum , and the recall is retrogressive , merely because its methods exhibit certain analogies to those used in city and tribal states , is denied ; and in a chapter under the title `` Direct versus Representative Government '' will be found an argument as masterful as has been put in print in favor of the direct system .

		The nationalizing of our democracy , while preserving in state and city vigorous agencies of local self-government ; the break - ing of the paralyzing grip of legalism , while preserving the respect of the people for law ; the extension to the body politic of unre - stricted and immediate control over its gov - ernmental institutions , while perpetuating the practical conveniences of the representative system , these are the supreme ends toward which , we are assured , all true progressivism moves .

		The cardinal proposition of Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	's book is that in the present era of unrest there is too much aimless drifting , too much futile beating of the waves , and not enough mastery of the situation such as the people are capable of if only they be well-informed , courageous , and ably led .

		That the epoch in which we live is one of unrest is a condition not of our choosing .

		The case against absolutism , com - mercial oligarchy , and unquestioned creeds has been made out .

		`` The rebel program is stated .

		Scientific invention and blind social currents have made the old authority impos - sible in fact , the artillery fire of the iconoclasts has shattered its prestige .

		We inherit a rebel tradition . ''

		In this situation , , the battle for us , we are admonished , lies not against crusted prejudice but against the chaos of a new free - dom .

		The danger is no longer from unreason - ing conservatism , but rather from the anarchy of untried , unorganized , combative radical - ism .

		There must somewhere be mastery , and under twentieth century conditions and ideas the only possible master is the people .

		This means democracy .

		But democracy must be conceived as something more than the absence of czars , more than freedom , more than equal opportunity .

		`` It is a way of life , a use of freedom , an embrace of opportunity . ''

		It is positive , virile , fundamental .

		But the proper mastery of their own affairs by the people is conditioned upon several things .

		It involves intelligence , alertness , and strong civic sense . ' '

		A servile community will have a master , if not a monarch then a land - lord or a boss , and no legal device will save it .

		A nation of uncritical drifters can change only the form of tyranny , for , like Christian 's sword , democracy is a weapon in the hands of those who have the courage and the skill to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 117 wield it ; in all others it is a rusty piece of junk . ' '

		The mastery of the people involves also a new .

		industrial emancipation .

		No one unafflicted with invincible ignorance , we are told , desires to preserve our economic system in its existing form .

		The thought is that there can be no true political democracy unless there is a much closer approach than at pres - ent to an economic democracy .

		Men must be reasonably well-to-do and accustomed to self - mastery before they can achieve a stable and masterful social or political democracy .

		Recognizing that the day is past when any - body can pretend to have laid down an inclu - sive or final analysis of the democratic prob - lem , Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	seeks in his book to diag - nose the current unrest and to ' ' arrive at some sense of what democracy implies . ''

		As he frankly explains , his chapters touch upon the American problem at only a few significant points .

		Of special interest is his discussion of the problem of ' ' big business , ' ' the labor move - ment , the trusts , the woman 's movement , and the contemporary processes of intellectual and social emancipation .

		But the book is notable for its points of view and for its penetrating , often caustic , observations upon the phenom - ena of our time , rather than for systematic discussion of any subject or group of subjects .

		It is not a book of information , but one of suggestion .

		If it preaches the doctrine of progressi vism , it does so by the general tenor of its philosophy , not by the grosser method of direct argument .

		It could not more deftly supplement Mr.
Croly	PERSON	's book if it had been written expressly for the purpose .

		In his '' Progressivism and After '' Mr.
Walling	PERSON	has given us , from the point of view of a socialist , an economic interpretation of contemporary American politics .

		That poli - tics in our day has well-nigh become a mere exercise in applied economics , is a fact known to every competent observer .

		Three-fourths of the time Mr.
Croly	PERSON	and Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	are writing in their books about matters which are distinctly economic , or which involve impor - tant economic relationships .

		Progressivism is itself builded upon the unrest which arises principally from economic conditions .

		It is not unnatural , therefore , that Mr.
Walling	PERSON	seeks to follow out in his thought the prepon - derating economic trend and attempts to iden - tify certain phases of present political and industrial development as stages in the his - toric process whose ultimate product , as he views it , is to be the socialistic state .

		That a complete and absolute social democracy is to be the eventual outcome of past and present developments , he never for a moment doubts .

		The rule of privileged minorities is to give way to that of privileged majorities , and by assisting in the establishment of true majority rule , albeit at first in the domain of govern - ment only , progressivism is playing directly into the hands of socialism .

		Of course Mr.
Walling	PERSON	does not expect the triumph of social - ism immediately .

		On the contrary that event is , he admits , a long way off .

		The capitalistic regime will hold out yet awhile , and it will even be constrained to extend to the wage - earning masses certain further improvements in conditions of life and labor , although only as an expedient to increase productivity and profits , not at all from considerations of altru - ism or of patriotism .

		Eventually , however , this will fail to satisfy and , the way having been prepared by the reforms carried through by progressivism , private capitalism will be succeeded by state capitalism ; that in time will give way to state socialism , or laborism ; and from this it will be but a step to the social - istic society in its final and idealized form .

		ARCTIC LANDS FORLORN .

		* Under the happy though cheerless title of `` Lands Forlorn , '' Mr.
George M. Douglas	PERSON	tells the story of his expedition in
1911-12	DATE	through a portion of the
Barren Grounds of Northern Canada	ORGANIZATION	to the mouth of the Copper - mine River .

		The ostensible object of the jour - ney was to report on the copper-bearing rocks of the Coppermine ; but , although scientific data of value were obtained , one gets the im - pression throughout the narrative that the underlying motive was exploration pure and simple .

		Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	had been engaged for years as an engineer in the hot and arid re - gions of the
Southwest	LOCATION	; and when oppor - tunity came for a holiday he naturally chose , being of an adventurous and resourceful disposition , the practically unexplored wilder - ness of the extreme north .

		The journey in - volved a certain amount of hardship , and enough danger to give spice to the adventure ; but what one finds peculiarly refreshing is the entire absence of that heroic pose that marks so many narratives of more or less original exploration .

		Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	makes it clear that a small party of white men , accustomed to roughing it , with a suitable equipment , and without the embarrassment of native guides , can not only travel practically anywhere in
Northern Canada	LOCATION	, but may winter there with no very serious danger or even discomfort .

		The route was by rail to
Edmonton	LOCATION	, thence * LANDS FORLORN .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	by stage to Athabaska Landing on the
Atha	LOCATION	- baska , thence by canoe and scow to
Fort Mc	LOCATION	-
Murray	PERSON	, and by the steamers of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	to
Lake Athabaska	LOCATION	and
Great Slave Lake	ORGANIZATION	and down the
Mackenzie	PERSON	to
Fort Norman	LOCATION	at the mouth of
Bear River	LOCATION	.

		Here the expedition really began , Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	and his companions being henceforth thrown upon their own resources .

		They made their way up
Bear River	LOCATION	, and through Great Bear Lake , not without a good deal of difficulty by reason of the ice ; and finally reached
Dease River	LOCATION	, where they built a comfortable log cabin to serve as headquarters .

		From this point to the Coppermine was no very great distance as the crow flies , but the intervening country pre - sented serious difficulties , not the least of which was the fact that very few white men had passed this way since
Hearne	PERSON	discovered the Coppermine in
1771	DATE	, and even these had left most imperfect descriptions of the route .

		Nevertheless Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	managed before the close of the season of
1911	DATE	to make his way over the height of land and down to the Cop - permine .

		Feeling that the way was now clear to their more ambitious expedition planned for the succeeding
spring	DATE	, he and his compan - ions settled down for the long winter at Hodg - son 's Point , their main camp .

		The chapter devoted to this winter in the Arctic makes exceedingly interesting reading .

		An ample supply of the right kind of provis - ions had been brought up from
Edmonton	LOCATION	, and systematic hunting added more than suffi - cient caribou and ptarmigan to keep the party in fresh meat , and for variety big lake trout could be got through the ice at any time ; dead spruce trees kept them in firewood .

		The work was so distributed that each man had it in turn to hunt , cook , and collect firewood ; the first and last gave them outdoor exercise , while cooking offered endless opportunities for culinary experiments not always favorably received .

		Bird life was remarkably abundant for this rigorous country ; ptarmigan were plentiful all the time , usually in large flocks , ravens were occasionally seen , as well as sev - eral kinds of hawks , whisky-jacks , chickadees , and once a big snow-white owl .

		The only really serious drawback seems to have been the absence of a convenient circulating library .

		Their stock of literature was naturally small .

		Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	had borrowed
Michelet	PERSON	's '' His - tory of
France	LOCATION	'' from the
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay Com - pany 's factor at
Fort Simpson	LOCATION	, and this proved a godsend to the party .

		It was read and re-read , though in a manner that was surely somewhat original .

		`` It was in two volumes , ' ' says Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	, ' ' and the Doctor would read one while I pored over the other ; then we would exchange , and re-exchange them .

		Whether he knows less about the early history of
France	LOCATION	now than I do I. would hesi - tate to conjecture .

		I do n't think Lion ever tackled this book ; had it been in three vol - umes he might have done so . ' '

		These winter quarters were some twenty-five miles within the Arctic Circle ; the sun was seen for the last time on
December 9	DATE	, and for the first time on New Year 's day ; the temperature in
Janu	LOCATION	- ary ran down to 56 , 57 , and 59 below zero .

		That men inexperienced in travel in the far north could spend a winter on Great Bear Lake , not merely in comfort but with appar - ent enjoyment , upsets many popular impres - sions as to the hardships of this region .

		The
spring	DATE	journey was in every respect successful .

		Thanks to their careful planning , and the knowledge of the route acquired the previous autumn , the explorers reached the Coppermine without serious difficulty , and made their way down to its mouth , spending some time in an examination of the copper deposits .

		Whether or not profitable ore exists in this country can not be determined without a more thorough survey .

		Throughout this part of the narrative one obtains exceedingly interesting glimpses of the Eskimos .

		The book is illustrated with reproductions of nearly two hundred photographs taken in the course of the journey , all interesting and some remarkably so .

		One that has rather a tragic interest represents
Radford	PERSON	and Street of the
Mounted Police	ORGANIZATION	in their canoe , at
Fort Simpson	LOCATION	, as they started out on the expedition from which they never returned .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The publication of an English version of
M. Artzibashef	PERSON	's `` Sanine '' is bound to at - tract attention .

		The book has been widely regarded as an expression of the despair into which the Russian intelligentsia degenerated after the failure of the last attempt to obtain a truly constitutional government , a despair which substituted doubt for faith and self - indulgence for self-sacrifice .

		It created a furore in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Saninism became a cult which spread rapidly through young
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The idea behind it was that the only happi - ness in life is to be found in the satisfaction of one 's immediate desires an idea which the book upholds by precept rather than by example since , with the exception of the hero , * SANINE .

New York	LOCATION	: D.
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 119 unhappiness is visited alike on those who yield to their instincts and those who do not .

		Until now `` Sanine '' has been regarded as unsuitable for translation into English , not merely because of its scenes of passion -LRB- which could , and to a degree have been , eliminated -RRB- but because of its point of view , so alien to the Anglo-Saxon in its acceptance of sex - hunger .

		Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	takes M. Artzibashef seriously , assuring us that while the tendency of this novel is to be deplored its art proves the author a man `` to be reckoned with . ''

		Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	, who has made out as good a case for the book as is possible , takes rather the opposite view .

		He remarks in his Preface to the present version : '' It has been objected to
M. Artzibashef	PERSON	's work that it deals so little with love and so much with physical necessity .

		That arises , I fancy , because his journalistic intention has overridden his artis - tic purpose .

		He has been exasperated into frank - ness rather than moved to truth .

		He has desired to lay certain facts of modern existence before the world and has done so in a form which could gain a hearing , as a pure work of art probably could not .

		He has attempted a re-valuation where it was most needed , where the unhappy
Weininger	PERSON	failed .

		Weininger demanded , insanely , that hu - manity should renounce sex and the brutality it fosters ; Artzibashef suggests that the brutishness should be accepted frankly , cleared of confusion with love , and slowly mastered so that out of pas - sion love can grow . ''

		We suspect that
M. Artzibashef	PERSON	will find some little difficulty in understanding what Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	is talking about , if he ever reads the English Preface to his novel ; but no matter .

		It is hard to believe that `` Sanine '' would have gained less of a hearing if it had been true instead of merely frank , like one of
M. Brieux	PERSON	's plays , but there is no question about the justice of Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's adjectives .

		`` Sanine '' is journalistic and frank rather than artistic and true .

		M. Artzibashef is hardly more to be `` reckoned with '' than any one of a dozen contemporary American nov - elists .

		He has set out to smash certain roman - tic notions about the sex motive , but in so far as he is successful he has only substituted one sentimentality for another .

		His admiration for Sanine , the strong , healthy , natural man who always takes what he wants and never regrets , who always says exactly what he means and who is as free from illusions as he is from doubts , is almost as naive as the adolescent boy 's admiration for
Jesse James	PERSON	.

		Sanine is the kind of dream of strength and beauty one might expect a highly introspec - tive , unhappy , and physically weak man to construct for himself .

		Those who are much given to the torture of doubt , and especially those who , lacking vitality , exaggerate the satisfactions of physical strength , are as sus - ceptible to this sort of romanticism exactly as vulgar , brutish people are susceptible to a kind of fine sentiment that amuses or disgusts persons of a critical sensibility .

		Those who thunder against such a book and those who hail it with a glad cry are perhaps equally mistaken .

		Its capacity to do good and its capacity to do harm are alike limited .

		But whatever its defects it is a sincere work .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's `` Young Earnest '' is very much in the vein of its predecessor , `` Old Mole . ''

		It is better organized , but there are not so many good bits in it .

		No one can possi - bly take exception to it on the same grounds as exception has been taken to
M. Artzibashef	ORGANIZATION	's book .


Rene Fourmy	PERSON	, the `` young Earnest '' of the title , is an instructor in economics at a provincial university who runs away from his classes and his wife to adopt driving a taxi-cab as a profession and to take a Lon - don factory girl as a mistress .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	is still vigorously engaged in attacking bour - geois society .

		It is characteristic that the struggle in his hero 's mind , which is the strug - gle to `` escape from sleep and death , '' should take him from a university instructorship to taxi-driving .

		It is characteristic , also , that Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	should be much more convincing about the sleep and death than about the escape from it .

		The story of how
Linda Brock	PERSON	, clever , pretty , conscienceless , set out to capture
Rene Fourmy	PERSON	is well done ; the story of
Ann Puddick	PERSON	is well done ; and even the story of
Catherine	PERSON	, whom he finally mar - ried , is well done .

		But somehow or other , though the women are well sketched in , the man , who should be something more than a sketch , is never put before us .

		The book remains amusing , and sometimes moving , but it is not very real .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	has so much to say about his people that he has to save on the space he uses in presenting them .

		In the endeavor to put the material of a very long novel into a minimum of pages he skips too much .

		There are conversations between
Rene	PERSON	and his mother ,
Rene	PERSON	and his father , and
Rene	PERSON	and the three women with whom he successively lives , of which one feels that peo - ple do n't say such things .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	is aware of it .

		He has tried to give us the essen - tials of their talk , having lent his people his own expressiveness in order to save our being bored with their inexpressiveness , but he sac - rifices too much of the illusion .

		We feel , as we have felt before of Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's novels , that this book is the artistic experiment , im - mensely interesting , of a talent both `` young '' and `` Earnest . ''

		If not his best book .


M. Maeter	PERSON	-
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, .

		, , / / m1 TT i / ^ i A. on subliminal linck s The Unknown Guest -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is certainly one of the most readable and stimulating works which he has yet produced .

		The clearness of his style , even in an English translation , is nothing short of amazing and a revelation to English readers accustomed to the cumbersome and in - tricate subtleties of other writers in similar fields .


William James	PERSON	and
M. Bergson	PERSON	have brought modern philosophies out of the clos - ets ; but an infinitely more difficult task is his who brings mysticism into the light of com - mon day and makes of it the most triumphant sort of common sense .

		Of the five chapters in the present book , three have already appeared in as many different magazines : ' ' The Knowl - edge of the Future , ' ' ' ' The Elberf eld Horses , ' ' and `` The Unknown Guest . ''

		The other two chapters , `` Phantasms of the Living and the Dead ' ' and ' ' Psychometry , ' ' are new .

		The book is the second of a trilogy : the first was an essay on death , entitled `` Our Eternity '' ; the present volume , dealing with veridical apparitions and hallucinations , psychometric manifestations , and all manner of subliminal phenomena , is to be followed by a third which will `` treat of the miracles of Lourdes and other places , the phenomena of so-called materialization , of the divining-rod and of fluidic asepsis . ''

		In his chapter on `` The Knowledge of the Future , '' M ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	presents a brief but trenchant scientific critique of the mightiest of all mysteries , psychological or theological .

		His investiga - tion at Elberfeld of
Herr Krall	PERSON	and his won - derful `` denkende Tiere , '' Muhammed ,
Zarif	PERSON	, and the rest , leaves little to be desired from the standpoint of scientific criticism , and cer - tainly nothing at all from that of artistic presentation .

		M.
Maeterlinck	PERSON	sees in these animals indubitable indications of clairvoy - ancy , and so thinks it proper to discuss their miracles of rapid calculation and spontaneous thought-origination along with the other mul - tiform and restless travailings of `` the un - known guest . ' '

		There is within us , he writes , `` a strange , inconsistent , whimsical and dis - concerting '' entity that `` seems to live on nothing but nondescript fare borrowed from worlds to which our intelligence as yet has no access .

		It lives under our reason , in a sort of invisible and perhaps eternal palace , like a casual guest , dropped from another planet , whose interests , ideas , habits , passions have naught in common with ours ... It knows everything , perhaps , but is ignorant of the uses of its knowledge .

		It has its arms laden with treasures ... Lastly , even at its best moments , it behaves as though the fate of the being in whose depth it dwells interested it hardly at all , as though it had but an insignifi - cant share in his misfortunes , feeling assured , one might almost think , of an independent and endless existence . ''

		This `` unknown guest '' pervades the book , and gives to its several chapters a gripping unity .

		If you don ' t believe that agricul - F arming as * .

		.

		.

		... , .

		the finest of ture is a noble calling , ranking high among the learned profes - sions , read Dr.
Harvey W. `` Wiley	PERSON	's book , `` The Lure of the Land '' -LRB- Century -RRB- , in which the former Chief Chemist of our national Depart - ment of Agriculture , now a scientific farmer in
Virginia	LOCATION	, ably and at the same time with much charm of manner defends the thesis that `` farming requires the greatest industry , the keenest intellect , and the best training of all of the professions . ''

		Though waiting until comparatively late in life before furnishing the most convincing possible proof of his faith in farming as the worthiest of mortal pursuits , Dr.
Wiley	PERSON	was born and bred on a farm and was from childhood familiar with the praises of farming life from his father 's lips .

		A favorite story often told by that wise father was as follows : `` A farmer with three sons was asked what he purposed to make of them .

		He replied : `
John	PERSON	is the brightest of my boys , the most industrious , anxious to work , and quick to learn .

		I am going to make a farmer of him .

		Sam would rather talk than work , and is fond of telling all he knows and much that he imagines .

		I am going to make a lawyer of him .

		Thomas is the laziest one of all my boys .

		In fact , he is so lazy that he never gets into any trouble of any kind .

		I am going to make a preacher of him . ' '

		One could hardly be better qualified than Dr.
Wiley	PERSON	both to engage intelligently in scientific farming and to write instructively and entertainingly about it .

		Going `` at a plump age , '' as he expresses it , to till the soil , he has both a stock of useful technical knowledge in agricultural chemistry and a good supply of apt idioms wherewith to communicate his knowledge and the results of his experience to intending farmers and to those other readers who must content themselves with enjoying his book without yielding to `` the lure of the land . ''

		Comparatively few are those who can wisely and successfully follow his example in taking up `` farming after fifty , '' but there are thou - sands of younger men , already tilling the soil or about to engage in that industry , who should be able to profit by the admonition and advice of this expert agriculturist .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 121 The war as war w iH n Ot last prelude to f orever , and it is not too soon to forecast its effect upon society .

		Among those who have sought to pierce the veil of the future is Mr.
L. Cecil Jane	PERSON	, whose volume entitled `` The Nations at War : The Birth of a New Era '' -LRB- Button -RRB- is a strangely optimistic prophecy .

		If one half of the bless - ings that Mr.
Jane	PERSON	categorically states will follow in the train of this war should actually ensue , the nations would have secured them at a bargain .

		The author believes that this war will usher in an age of toleration to supersede intolerance in the recognition of nationalism , and of voluntary assent in place of coercion in government .

		These two substitutions will ful - fil all the law and the prophets ; arbitration will settle international and domestic disputes ; militarism will perish , because the fallacy of entrusting the maintenance of peace to an armed camp has been exposed ; the work of the French Revolution will be consummated in the triumph of democracy ; strikes will be no more , because employer and employee will approach each other as friends with common interests ; the sexes will be on a legal equality ; the agencies of culture , religion , and govern - ment will all press forward with new ideals of tolerant cooperation ; statesmen will be sought , rather than party-men , by an electorate which has a new sense of values .

		Few readers will go all the way to his Utopia with Mr.
Jane	PERSON	, but one may catch something of his enthusiasm , and be the better for it .

		If the world is going to be better after this war , as it must be , not one man but millions of men must have the faith and the optimism of Mr.
Jane	PERSON	.

		The only way that one may sit in the present darkness with any comfort is to believe that the light of a better day is about to break in men 's hearts .

		It is encouraging that such a book as this should find a publisher at the present time .

		Health in its The socialization of medicine in - social aspects volves not only the application lce - of the discoveries of biological and medical sciences in the fields of public and social hygiene , sanitation , and preventive medicine , but also the creation of a sound pub - lic opinion based on a knowledge and appre - ciation of the discoveries of the past few years which are revolutionizing medical science and practice .

		One of the main factors in the crea - tion of such a public opinion is the ability to command a hearing in this day of health fad - dists and of negations .

		Dr.
Woods Hutchin	PERSON	- son wields so trenchant a pen that his readers are always interested and entertained , if not convinced .

		Unstilted , untechnical , versatile , and rich in allusion to affairs past and pres - ent , he challenges the mind of his reader by the brilliancy and piquancy of his attack , the wealth of his material , and the forcefulness with which he repeatedly drives home the sig - nificant conclusions regarding diseases and their social consequences .

		His latest volume of essays , `` Civilization and Health '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , is a rapid-fire defence of the new science of preventive medicine , of the utilization of guinea pigs in medical research , and of the feminist movement in so far as it offers a wider field of action for women and is based on a candid recognition of the physical differ - ences between men and women in their nervous organization and limitations .

		He also takes up the cudgels for the employer 's interest in the employee 's health , the regulation of industry from the standpoint of hygiene and health , personal and national , lends a hand to the `` swat the fly '' and pure milk campaigns , and has a good word to say for the vacation habit and the out-of-door life .

		Such books make for intelligent citizenship , and for efficiency in the hygienic functioning of the body politic .

		Varied aspects In Mr - JaKleS Davenpqrt Whelp - of American ley s volume entitled Amer - ican Public Opinion '' -LRB- Button -RRB- there are presented fourteen essays upon varied aspects of the public affairs of this country .

		All save two have appeared pre - viously in English or American magazines .

		Five deal with subjects of a domestic nature , including two in which there are some observa - tions upon the character of public opinion in this country .

		The other nine deal with phases of foreign policy the handicaps of the diplo - matic service , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, food as an international asset , and the relations of the
United States	LOCATION	with
Mexico	LOCATION	, with the
Balkan States	LOCATION	, with
Russia	LOCATION	, with
Japan	LOCATION	, and with the Far East in general .

		There is not in the essays much that is new or anything that is profound .

		There is a good deal that is inaccurate .

		For example , in the opening paragraph of `` The Overtaxed Melting-Pot '' we are told that the immigration measure vetoed in
1913	DATE	by Presi - dent Taft imposed a literacy test upon every alien coming to the
United States	LOCATION	, when as a matter of fact large numbers of newcomers -LRB- relatives of admissible aliens -RRB- were specifi - cally exempted .

		And one wonders by what sort of prescience the author came to the knowledge that this measure , re-introduced in the present
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, would `` in time become a law with the sanction of President
Wilson	PERSON	. ' '

		The work of the
Immigration Commission of 1907	ORGANIZATION	is unjustly criticized , and the essay is in other respects at fault .

		All in all , one can not repress the observation that if these papers were to be reprinted , they should first have been revised and corrected .

		122 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	A camera actress in
West Africa	LOCATION	.

		The cinematograph is playing no small part in undermining the reading habit and lessening the demand for printed books , particularly among the rising generation .

		It is therefore somewhat refreshing to discover from the pen of a `` movie '' actress a serious book devoted to the writer 's experiences in West African wilds while collecting films depicting native life , and when posing as the white heroine in
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- African cinematograph dramas in con - junction with Major Schomburgk .

		Miss
M. Gehrts	PERSON	's `` A Camera Actress in the Wilds of Togoland '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is written with little stress on the professional aspects of the au - thor 's remarkable trip into the remotest cor - ners of this German colony .

		It is , rather , an extensively illustrated narrative of the jour - ney of a very observant woman , observant especially of German efficiency in matters of health and sanitation , of the development of commerce and industry , and discipline of the native peoples under their control .

		She is chiefly interested in human nature , and as a result her narrative is concerned more with the incidents of the expedition than with the natural features of the country she explored .

		Her excellent photographs and interesting chapters tell us little of the wild life of the jungle , but are replete with accounts of the native tribes .

		Talks on life `` The College Course and the lli C cMw er Preparation for Life '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- president , ton -RRB- is a series of eight talks delivered at
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	by Dr.
Albert Parker Fitch	PERSON	, president of the
Faculty of Andover Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is heartily to be recommended for its sane , stimulating , and vivid discussion of the life and the ideals of college students .

		President
Fitch	PERSON	writes with a candor and an undeviating directness which must appeal to even the most blase of young men .

		Fearlessly , nobly , and with good will for all youth , in his chapter entitled `` The Fight for Character '' the au - thor searches with explicit analysis the very heart of the temptations of college life , and offers wise counsel to those who are dwarfed and cramped by unworthy standards .

		Whether read by collegians or by others , the book will prove an ardent and undidactic call to higher ideals .

		The chapters on religious experience , as well as those on `` The Distaste for the Beautiful '' and `` Is Learning Essential ? ''

		re - veal much that is profoundly significant in the trend of modern life .

		Here , and through - out the book , the keen idealism of a tolerant yet critical observer gives special zest to all that President
Fitch	PERSON	has to say .

		Sir
J. G. Frazer	PERSON	's selection of
Addison	PERSON	's Essays , which Messrs.

February 3	DATE	Third Edition Now Ready THE HARBOR By
Ernest Poole	PERSON	Mr.
Poole	PERSON	has written a novel of remarkable power and ` vision in which are depicted the great changes taking place in American life , business and ideals in the present generation .

		Under the tremendous influence of the great
New York	LOCATION	harbor , with its docks , warehouses , its huge liners and its workers , a young writer passes , in the devel - opment of his life and work , from a blind worship of enterprise and efficiency to a deeper knowledge and understanding of humanity .

		N. Y. Times `` This first book of his is by all odds the best American novel that has appeared in many a long day .

		It is earnest , sincere , broad in scope and purpose , well balanced , combining intel - lect and emotion ... The characters are ably drawn , strikingly contrasted , essentially American ... Here in this vision of the harbor is focused much of our modern world , its perplexities , its struggles and its ideals ... Mr.
Poole	PERSON	may be congratulated upon having written an absorbingly interest - ing and very significant novel . ''

		N. Y. Post 11 Many and varied as are the themes that have been woven together to make the whole , each one is clean cut and fits into its right place .

		` The Har - bor ' is well worth reading , both for what it gives and the manner in which that is given . ''


N. Y. Tribune	PERSON	`` This is a remarkable book , ... an achievement in itself .

		It is one of the ablest novels added to American fiction in many a year ... The first really notable novel produced by the new democracy , ... a book of the past and the present and the future , not only of
New York	LOCATION	and of this country , but of all the world .

		.

		.

		Mr.
Poole	PERSON	is an author of exceptional gifts , of ideas and convictions .

		Let us hope that the American reading public , which has neglected so many new talents among us , will give him in fullest measure the recog - nition which he so fully de - serves . ''

A work which must be placed at once among the rare books that count which may prove quite possibly to be the distinctive American novel of the year ... He finds in the harbor the glory and the wretchedness of the world , together with a new , vast breadth of outlook and a new depth of thought ... The
New York	LOCATION	it presents is no limited city , but a vast world centre of ideas , ideals , hope , passions and struggles . ''

		159 WAR AND POETRY .

		A German visitor came to the
United States	LOCATION	not long ago for the purpose of sound - ing American sentiment upon the subject of the great war .

		After some weeks of investiga - tion , during which he interviewed many peo - ple in the various walks of life , and read his fill of newspaper and magazine comment , he became a very despondent and chastened per - son .

		In conversation one day , the discussion turned upon the bankruptcy of German diplo - macy in the weeks preceding the outbreak of hostilities , and it was suggested to him that the capital error of his country was to be found in its failure to understand the psychology of the English people .

		He admitted the justice of the criticism , and added with a sigh : `` We did not know how they hated us , '' thereby affording an illustration more striking than any argument in its illumination of the charge .

		Now we knew very well how the Germans hate the English .

		The passion is expressed in thousands of sayings , both private and official , that have of late found issue from the German mind , and is a national attitude merely crys - tallized in
Herr Ernst Lissauer	PERSON	's `` Hassge - sang , ' ' which has been so adroitly turned into English and so widely read .

		When this truly hateful poem came to the attention of the English public , it was accompanied -LRB- in a letter to `` The Spectator '' -RRB- by an expression of naive surprise that it should have been first published in `` Jugend , '' which from its title would seem to be `` a magazine for boys and girls . ''

		So even the most ghastly subjects are sometimes lighted up by flashes of unconscious humor .

		Probably no German in these heated days could grasp the simple and obvious truth that an outburst against
Germany	LOCATION	in
Herr Lissauer	PERSON	's violent strain could not possibly be a product of the English mind .

		We can read - ily imagine an Englishman of the type , say , of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	or Mr.
Watson	PERSON	or Mr.
Hew	PERSON	- lett , countering with an entirely sincere and heartfelt `` Liebesgesang '' for the country of the enemy although such an expression would of course be addressed to the
Germany	LOCATION	of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	, of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	and
Wagner	PERSON	, of
Kant	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, the coun - 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 4	DATE	try of the soul cherished in countless English hearts , rather than to the
Germany	LOCATION	of Treitschke and
Bernhardi	PERSON	and the
Prussian Kaiser	PERSON	, or of the excited German professors whose manifesto last autumn was such a shock to the moral consciousness of the world 's commonwealth of ideas .

		In very truth , no one who has the least understanding of the En - glish psychology believes that its attitude toward the Germans is one of hatred .

		It hates the evil of the German policies and pedantic methods of warfare , but it retains a deep and genuine sympathy for the German people , and does not withhold from them its meed of praise for their valor in arms , for their self-sacrifice and devotion to the Fatherland , and for the beau geste that occasionally shines out through the murk of the strife .

		Those who imagine that Englishmen hate the Germans are of the purblind tribe who find in the `` Divine Comedy '' merely a record of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's personal hatreds , and the expression of his vindictive - ness toward his enemies .

		Meanwhile , a differ - ent sort of counter to the attack is provided from
America	LOCATION	in Miss
Helen Gray Cone	PERSON	's beautiful `` Song of Love for
England	LOCATION	, '' pub - lished in `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' a month ago .

		The relations between poetry and war have long been a subject of literary discussion and even of controversy .

		There are some who hold that such a flowering of a nation 's passion as is manifested by its participation in war is bound to arouse and stimulate the poetical faculty to unwonted exaltations of expression .

		By a careful process of selection , the facts may often be made to fit in with this thesis , and give it plausible support .

		On the other hand , a broader view will tend to dislodge such a conclusion , and lead us back to the proposition that the wind of the spirit of genius ' ' bloweth where it listeth , '' and that no historical syn - thesis can establish a sure relation -LRB- except for Tyrtaean strains -RRB- between the agony of war and the agony whereby the poet 's mind is impelled to teach in song what it has learned in suffering . ''

		Vex thou not the poet 's mind With thy shallow wit , '' is an injunction that may profitably be laid upon the theorists who are disposed to formu - late rules upon which the poetic faculty per - force must act .

		Our own Civil War , one of the greatest in history until all comparisons were dwarfed by the horror of
last autumn	DATE	, now still upon the world , affords a case in point .

		It must be ad - mitted that
Browne	PERSON	's `` Bugle Echoes , '' which represents the best possible gleaning from that field of endeavor , is a work that contains very little poetry of enduring value .

		We who knew the poems of the Civil War period when they came white-hot from the heart and imagina - tion of their singers , are still reluctant to acquiesce in any appraisal that allows them no more than their eternal and objective value , but there remain , after all , very few pieces that belong to the world 's golden treasury .

		Lowell 's `` Commemoration Ode '' and Whit - man 's `` When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed , '' are about all that we are sure of .

		to which , for our inglorious little war of a later date , must be added
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's `` Ode in Time of Hesitation . ''

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	seems to have said the last word of wisdom upon this subject : '' The late Civil War was not of itself an incen - tive to good poetry and art , nor directly productive of them .

		Such disorders seldom are ; action is a substitute for the ideal , and the thinker 's or dream - er 's life seems ignoble and repugnant .

		But we shall see that the moral and emotional conflicts preceding the war , and leading to it , were largely stimulating to poetic ardor ; they broke into expression , and buoyed with earnest and fervid sentiment our heroic verse The Civil War was a general absorbent at the crisis when a second group of poets began to form .

		The conflict not only checked the rise of a new school , but was followed by a time of languor in which the songs of Apollo seemed trivial to those who had listened to the shout of Mars . ''

		We can not , then , predict with any assurance that the world war of this year will bear the fruit of a poetical renascence .

		If it should , the ripening will be slow , and the harvest long delayed .

		There is no indication that the poet for the occasion now exists anywhere unless he be
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	as the poet was found in 1870-71 in the person of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, who forged `` L'Annee Terrible '' in the white heat of his passionate indignation .

		No one seems capable just now of getting the right perspec - tive , or striking a deeper note than that of vehemence and outraged sensibility .

		Probably the finest poem occasioned by the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian war was
George Meredith	PERSON	's ``
France	LOCATION	in
December , 1870	DATE	, '' written at the time , it is true , but with so deep and comprehensive an understanding of its theme that it now reads like the verdict of the ages .

		But we scan the horizon in vain for a Meredith in this super - terrible year .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 135 All this does not mean that the poets , such as they are , have been silent during the past half-year .

		They have risen promptly , even too promptly , to the appeal , and dashed off com - positions innumerable showing their hearts to be in the right place -LRB-
Tipperary	LOCATION	or else - where -RRB- , but not often reaching the heights of which their previous performances have shown them capable .

		The flow of their rhymes has too often been turgid , and its waters anything but crystal-clear .

		Now and then , indeed , as in Mr.
Barry Pain	PERSON	's lines on `` The
Kaiser	PERSON	and God , '' we get a really impressive bit of verse : '' Impious braggart , you forget ; God is not your conscript yet ; You shall learn in dumb amaze That His ways are not your ways , That the mire through which you trod Is not the high white road of God , To Whom , whichever way the combat rolls , We , fighting to the end , commend our souls . ''

		But it must be admitted that the poetry of the war has thus far proved a disappointment .

		The output of English verse upon this theme seems to deserve , as a whole , the treatment given it in these lines by a
London	LOCATION	journalist : '' Has
Robert Bridges	ORGANIZATION	's success with fighting Been such as to encourage emulation ?

		Or Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's ' bit them in the Bight ' - ing ?

		Or the same author 's other lucubration -LRB- Yet one more blow for a disthressful nation -RRB- In which , dead gravelled for a rhyme for '
Ireland	LOCATION	, ' He struggled out with ' motherland and sireland ' ? ''

		Did even the voice from
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's shelf Say anything it had not said before ?

		And was not
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	just himself ?

		And was not
Newbolt	ORGANIZATION	's effort on the war Distinctly less effective than of yore ?

		And would not German shrapnel in the leg be Less lacerating than the verse of Begbie ? ''

		After all , poets exist by the grace of God , and neither war nor any other fortuitous cir - cumstance can create them .

		If they are on hand in a great spiritual crisis like the pres - ent , well and good ; but we must not expect them to be struck off from the mint of human potentiality even by such a struggle as the present , in which all the interests and ideals that civilization holds dear are at stake .

		The real singers of the present cataclysm may be yet unborn , and that Weltgericht which it is the peculiar mission of the poet to pronounce upon it may not find expression until the hor - rors of this war have become as '' Old , unhappy , far-off things , And battles long ago . ''

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE ROAD TO AUTHORSHIP is of varying length .

		Some writers produce books in their early ` teens , while others , not less endowed with the vision and the faculty divine , yet want the accomplishment of book-writing , and die with only a meagre magazine article or two to their credit .

		An instance not at all belonging in this latter class comes to our attention .

		In
1890	DATE	a young colored man of
Alabama	LOCATION	w.as so fortunate as to find himself in the neighborhood of Tuskegee and yielded to the impulse to seek an interview with Mr.
Booker	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	, in the hope of gaining admittance to the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	under the latter 's superintendence .

		In answer to certain ques - tions put to him as an entrance examination , the young man was unable even to tell the county or the state or the nation in which he lived , and when interrogated as to the parts of speech he answered that they were the lips , teeth , tongue , and throat .

		Nevertheless he was admitted to the
Tuskegee Institute	ORGANIZATION	and was put to work at stripping fodder from sorghum cane .

		It is this member of our large negro population who now comes before the book-reading public as author of `` The Black Man 's Burden , '' evidently a not insignificant piece of work , to which the Principal of Tus - kegee contributes an introduction , and which one critic pronounces to be `` among the six greatest works by members of the negro race '' that he has read .

		Mr.
William H. Holtzclaw	PERSON	for he is the author was graduated from Tuskegee in
1898	DATE	, and has since then founded and built up the
Utica Normal and Industrial Institute	ORGANIZATION	, at
Utica	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	, which to-day has more than five hundred pupils , taught by thirty-five instructors , and owns 1700 acres of land , with fourteen buildings .

		And less than twenty-five years ago the head of this great school and the author of the notable book that has served as text to these rather desultory re - marks did not know the parts of speech .

		SEEKERS AFTER CURIOUS AND RARE BITS OF INFORMATION furnish more occupation to ref - erence-room attendants than all other persons combined .

		Experience in library work has proved that there is almost no imaginable query that may not at any time be sprung upon the supposedly omniscient librarian or some member of his staff .

		For instance , earnest inquiry was once made , in our hearing , at a certain public library , concerning the color of the
Due de Reichstadt	ORGANIZATION	's hair and eyes , and as to whether his hair was curly or straight ; and another inquirer wished to - know how much port wine was consumed m 136 THE DIAL
March 4	DATE	England in the year
1716	DATE	.

		No veteran library worker would be surprised or very much dis - concerted at being abruptly asked whether
Queen Elizabeth	PERSON	was in the habit of putting her right shoe on before her left , or the re - verse ; or whether dentistry was known to the ancient Egyptians ; or what proportion of those wounded in the battle of
Hastings	PERSON	died of their injuries .

		In order to meet with smil - ing confidence such manifestations of extraor - dinary thirst for knowledge , libraries are now more and more following the practice of index - ing and classifying their available stores of out-of-the-way information .

		The
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has begun a `` Facts and Fig - ures Index '' of this nature .

		From a week 's list of inquiries it publishes a few sample ques - tions on the preparation of peanuts for mar - ket , the number of buildings erected in large cities in
1913	DATE	, the regulations for packing motion-picture films for shipping , the rise in real-estate values , the amount of food con - sumed by the nations at war , the number of deaths attributable to alcohol , and other equally interesting matters .

		If one would learn the vast range and variety of his own ignorance , let him serve for a week as refer - ence librarian in a large library .

		AN EMBARRASSING OBLIGATION that has often made itself felt outside the library world is the subject of some editorial remarks in the `` Library Occurrent '' the quarterly publica - tion of the
Indiana Public Library Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion .

		After giving suggestions for district meetings of library workers , the writer refers to two reasons that `` clearly seem to have deterred some districts from meeting oftener : difficulty in finding an easily accessible meet - ing place , and fear of social obligations con - nected with the meeting . ''

		As to the latter reason , `` District meetings are professional meetings , and , though there is properly a so - cial atmosphere when friends meet , there should be no attempt on the part of the host to furnish refreshments or entertainment .

		Unquestionably , such hospitality adds much to the pleasure of the meeting , but the expressed opinions of many librarians make as unques - tionable the fact that many librarians whose boards are unwilling to pay for such entertain - ment and who themselves can not afford to do so , feel it impossible to invite the district to meet with them .

		Either such entertaining should be entirely omitted or the district itself , if it so votes , should contribute towards the expense . ''

		Possibly a useful hint might here be conveyed by citing the example of the charming Mrs.
Ware	PERSON	-LRB- wife of the author of `` Zenobia , '' `` Julian , '' and other books now too little read -RRB- who by her graces and accom - plishments as hostess could so delight those who gathered about her rather meagre board that they became unaware whether they were partaking of simple bread and butter and tea or were feasting on ambrosia and nectar , but with a subsequent impression that it had been ambrosia and nectar .

		THE PASSION FOR TEXTUAL CRITICISM has un - doubtedly been indulged in with less restraint by German scholars than by the scholars of any other country , and the stock illustration of this passion raised to its highest power is the traditional but unauthenticated instance of the learned
Teuton	PERSON	who devoted a lifetime to the study and explanation , of a certain punctuation mark in an ancient manuscript , only to discover at the very end that it was nothing but a fly-speck after all .

		A conspicu - ous example of industry and zeal in textual criticism was the late
Ingram Bywater	PERSON	, for - merly Regius Professor of Greek at
Oxford	LOCATION	, who died in one of the last days of the past year , and whose titles and honors and list of scholarly publications make a most impressive showing .

		He edited with microscopic care the fragments of
Heraclitus	PERSON	, the works of Pris - cianus Lydus ,
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's `` Nicomachean Ethics '' and `` Poetics , '' and wrote a treatise on the textual criticism of the `` Ethics . ''

		But it was his work on the ' ' Poetics ' ' that consti - tuted his magnum opus , though that frag - mentary disquisition itself is but an opuscule , an inconsiderable item in the list of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Years of painstaking research were devoted to this task , and it was not until
1897	DATE	, when
Bywater	LOCATION	was fifty-seven years old , that he ventured to give to the world his recension of the text , with critical commentary .

		Then followed a dozen years of further study of the Aristotelian text , after which , in
1909	DATE	, he issued his final enlarged and emended work on the `` Poetics , '' accompanied by a transla - tion and elaborate commentary .

		From that time until his death he had lived , more em - phatically than before , the life of a scholarly recluse among his books , in his home at
Onslow Square	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		JUVENILE DISRESPECT FOR LITERARY PROP - ERTY , or , in plainer language , young people 's tendency to steal books , has compelled the trustees of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library to discontinue , so far as the children of that city of culture are concerned , the free - dom of access to bookshelves which is the glory and the pride of those library workers who like to believe that the great public is becoming more and more intelligently and conscien -
1915	DATE	-RSB- 137 tiously responsive to the increasing opportuni - ties and privileges extended to it by those who purvey to its literary needs .

		An inventory , the first one in five years , has lately been com - pleted in the juvenile department of the Cam - bridge library , and it reveals a loss , by theft or otherwise , of more than a thousand vol - umes .

		Hence the trustees ' action in enclosing the formerly open children 's shelves .

		`` The new arrangement , '' reports the librarian , `` is working admirably from the point of view of both the children and the attendants .

		Its economic , administrative and educational ad - vantages seem already assured .

		It makes practicable the keeping of the books in better condition , and the room in better order .

		It enables the attendants to know that a book not in its proper place on the shelves is really out and not merely misplaced .

		It tends , by empha - sizing our own care for the books , to make the children more reverent and careful of them .

		Above all , it obviates the moral risk involved in an arrangement which , because of the struc - tural plan of the room , permitted among chil - dren frequent and undetected thefts . ''

		It may be that these children will value their later and less restricted library privileges the more highly for this early curb to their law - lessness .

		... FRENCH POETRY AND GERMAN POETRY were once compared , or contrasted , by
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	, in humorously realistic phrase , in one of his familiar letters .

		He said : `` I am coming to believe the Germans an unpoetic people even their greatest poets are pretty wordy and dull and clumsy .

		But there is a school of modern French poets worth trans - lating .

		I have been doing some of Sully Prud - homme , for instance .

		It is to the Germans as cloud-fluff to cheese . ' '

		In the same vein one of his published bits of prose has this : `` Perhaps the best topics on which to feel the difference are those two immemorial inspirers of song , war and love .

		`` When the German poet sings of war , it is with the solemnity of
Korner	ORGANIZATION	's ` Gebet wahrend der Schlacht . '

		When the French poet sings of it , it is with the ' Gai !

		Gai ! '

		of
Beranger	PERSON	.

		In the one , you hear the heavy tread of men , a dull , regular beat , which , after all , is not very distinguish - able to the ear , as to whether it be an advanc - ing column or a funeral march .

		In the other you hear only the bugles ringing and shouts of enthusiasm and excitement . ''

		In what fol - lows the Germans seem to have the better of it ; or are the French here , too , more truly poetic ?

		`` In their treatment of love there is even sharper contrast .

		The German word Liebe has quite a different atmosphere of sug - gestion from the French amour .

		The German poet sings of love and home ; you feel that there is at least a possibility that the passion of to-day will outlast the year , or the years .

		Constancy is one of its very elements .

		When the French poet sings of love , it is very deli - cate , rosy , beautiful , but we do not hear of home . ''

		These quotations are from the just - published biography of Sill , reviewed on an - other page .

		READERS BEHIND THE BARS of prison cells make a peculiar appeal to the library worker , and library-extension activities in our penal institutions are increasing at an encouraging rate .

		Stone walls do not a prison make , nor iron bars a cage , to a convict absorbed in a good book .

		To the old school of penologists this would seem to be an argument for with - holding the good book , but luckily the ten - dency now is to lessen the rigors of incarcera - tion in various reformatory ways , including the influence of wholesome literature .

		In the `` Seventh Biennial Report of the
Nebraska Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	'' a very readable section treats of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	's supervision of libraries in
State	LOCATION	institutions .

		Here is a passage : `` In writing of his library work with the men at the penitentiary , one of our former librarians says , ' A prison library can be the drive wheel on the engine of discipline . '

		This same man , whose first introduction to a library was in our state prison , after his release sent in from one of our far western counties for a traveling library for the girls and boys of the community .

		The books had to be hauled thirty miles from the railroad .

		This fall he sent for another library and sent an additional request for books for the nearest school .

		Still later , another request was received from this same district .

		`` We are ' proud indeed of the work this man is voluntarily doing and to know that his interest in libraries is a permanent one . ''

		It needs but a glance at a library map of
Nebraska	LOCATION	, where whole counties are still library-less , to demonstrate the opportunity there offered for an unlimited amount of such library-extension work as this ex-convict is now so zealously doing .

		.

		THE PLACE OF CRITICISM in the scheme of things is one to which the critics themselves are , naturally enough , prone to ascribe too much importance .

		In a current magazine article on `` The Acid of Criticism '' the Rev.
Hugh Black	PERSON	says some things that apply not only to Bible criticism , which is his main theme , but also to literary criticism in general and , in fact , to criticism in a still more inclu - sive sense .

		It is well to be reminded , now and then , that criticism commonly , though not 138 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 4	DATE	always , `` deals with the fringe , the methods and the outward manifestations of life .

		There is room for criticism , for thought , for reason in the unfathomable depths of divine truth , but these do not generate the truth .

		It is intuitive .

		The child , the ignorant , the un - learned may see it .

		It is to be seen , not argued about .

		Men spoke before the laws of gram - mar were propounded .

		Men reasoned before
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	built up logic .

		Men sang before the theory of music was dreamed of .

		Men ate before the chemistry of edibles was studied .

		Men believed before the theology was built up into a system to formulate their faith .

		The explanation may be difficult , but the thing itself is simple .

		The science of it may be im - perfect and hard , but the thing itself is intui - tive a flash , a gleam , an inspiration , an act . ' '

		Those who believe that the first duty of criti - cism is to be constructive and not destructive , positive and not negative , sympathetic and generously appreciative rather than antipa - thetic and grudgingly laudatory , will enjoy reading in full the utterance here fragmen - tarily cited .

		It is to be found in the
February	DATE	number of `` Everybody 's Magazine . ''

		BOOKS AS FOOD FOR THE FLAMES are expen - sive fuel .

		The number of valuable libraries that , partly or wholly , have in recent years gone up in smoke is larger than most people would suspect .

		The fire in the
Wisconsin State House	ORGANIZATION	destroyed several department libraries and the travelling library collections there in store .

		The
Maryland Institute	ORGANIZATION	lost by fire a rich collection of works on art and archi - tecture , more than twenty thousand volumes in all .


McGill University	ORGANIZATION	suffered a like de - struction of its medical library ; the
Spring	LOCATION	- field -LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB-
City Library	ORGANIZATION	has experienced a serious loss by damage to its books by fire ;
Turin	LOCATION	's ancient university had one hundred thousand volumes of its library reduced to ashes ; a branch of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	was wiped out by fire ;
San Francisco	LOCATION	lost its public library by earthquake and fire ; the
Equitable Life Insurance Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, after forming what was esteemed a unique library in its special department , saw it fall a prey to the flames ; the
Paterson	PERSON	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library was totally destroyed by fire ; the library of the
University of Vir	ORGANIZATION	- ginia suffered a like fate ; and , to cap the cli - max , the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, the most important collection of its kind in the country , fed to the flames nearly half a million volumes , more than quarter of a million manu - scripts , and three hundred thousand pam - phlets .

		These rather startling proofs of `` hindsight '' in the fireproofing of libraries are cited by the
Michigan Library Association	ORGANIZATION	in an appeal to the
State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	to provide safe quarters for the
Michigan State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Lansing	LOCATION	.

		COMMON SENSE IN BIBLIOGRAPHY needs to be preached to the enthusiastic bibliographer .

		Here is a wise word from the current number of ' ' The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of
America	LOCATION	, '' the writer being Mr.
Frederick W. Jenkins	PERSON	: `` To my mind the greatest need is not more of the mechanical records of every good , bad , and indifferent publication , but an indication of really important articles and pamphlets , as well as books .

		In using such records I find nine-tenths of the entries only an annoyance .

		The scholarly tendency to put down every conceivable thing is like the crazy librarian who saves everything in type .

		The real service to the public is to make a list of the things one really needs to read .

		It is a mighty unimportant thing practically to peo - ple to see a catalogue of everything that has been printed on a certain point ; 99 per cent , of the value rests in finding what there is that is worth consulting . ' '

		This is from an article on `` Bibliography and its Relation to Social Work '' a not very obvious relation at first thought , but still existent , else Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	could not have filled four octavo pages on the subject .

		Other papers in the same issue are a `` Bibliographical Outline of French-Cana - dian Literature , '' by Mr.
James Geddes , Jr.	PERSON	, a short article on the proposed check-list of Canadian public documents , by Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	, and an account of the
Durrett Col	ORGANIZATION	- lection in the Library of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, more especially its newspapers , by Mr.
Edward A. Henry	PERSON	.

		ONE OF THE FAMOUS LAWSUITS OF FICTION IS recalled to the novel-reader 's mind by the recent death of
David Jennings	PERSON	in the work - house at
Wolverhampton	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		He was of rather more than local celebrity as the claimant to the ' '
Jennings	PERSON	millions , ' ' a Bir - mingham estate long held in rather precarious possession , and at an immense cost for legal de - fence , by the descendants of Lady
Andover	LOCATION	and
Earl Howe	PERSON	; or at least that is the current ac - count of the matter .

		Dickens 's famous case of ''
Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce	PERSON	'' in `` Bleak House , '' the wearisome Chancery suit `` never ending , still beginning , '' is said to be taken from the
Jennings	PERSON	controversy over the
Birmingham	LOCATION	property .


William Jennings	PERSON	, or
Jennens	PERSON	, known as `` William the Rich , '' accumulated wealth to the extent of about
eight million dollars	MONEY	, and also owned extensive tracts of
1915	DATE	-RSB- 139 land in what is now the centre of Birming - ham .

		He died in
1798	DATE	, and the greater part of this handsome property passed to the two persons named above , who claimed to be the next of kin .

		From that time until about forty years ago there was almost constant litigation over the disputed millions , and a goodly share thereof was spent in keeping them out of the avid Jenningses ' hands which , for aught one knows , may have been the hands rightly entitled to them .

		But with the death of poor
David	PERSON	in the workhouse the likelihood of fur - ther legal dispute over the famous property seems to have disappeared .

		BOOKS `` NEVER IN '' are naturally regarded by many disappointed library-frequenters as nothing but a snare and a delusion .

		The latest quarterly bulletin of the
Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Atlanta	LOCATION	prints some observations and direc - tions in regard to these elusive works of litera - ture , remarking with truth that `` nothing is more discouraging than to go to the library several times in a vain attempt to find a book , ' ' and informing the reader how , at the expense of
one cent	MONEY	for a postal card , to secure the reservation of such book , unless it be a novel not in the rent collection , at the earliest pos - sible moment .

		Some libraries undertake to reserve for applicants all novels except recent accessions ; others go so far as to reserve even these upon request ; and we recall one library where instruction was issued from high quar - ters to the desk attendants to make a note of all books , of whatever kind , applied for unsuccess - fully , with names and addresses of the appli - cants , and to reserve these books as fast as they came in , at the same time notifying the appli - cants that the books asked for were now avail - able .

		Any library worker can easily imagine the rapidly increasing congestion and confu - sion that speedily resulted in the department undertaking this record .

		Only a quiet and dis - creet disobedience of the rule , in all its rigor , saved the desk attendants from insanity and the circulation department from paralysis .

		* LITERARY DIPLOMATS from the
United States of America	LOCATION	are at present filling positions call - ing for the greatest practical sagacity and untiring energy as well as the utmost tact and diplomacy .

		A more difficult task than that imposed for the past six months on our Bel - gian minister could hardly be imagined .

		Probably Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	's previous `` forty years of it '' will seem as child 's play to him when contrasted with this subsequent shorter period , which ought to furnish a supplement to that earlier narrative far more thrilling than anything recorded in those noteworthy chapters .

		Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	, too , at The Hague , must have been acquiring a store of raw mate - rial for future literary use such as falls to the lot of few writers .

		Mr.
Walter Page	PERSON	, also , trained to the labors of the pen before he essayed those of the ambassador , is in the very heart of things at
London	LOCATION	, and may be reck - oned upon to give some interesting account of himself one of these days .

		Our other
Ambas	LOCATION	- sador Page , at
Rome	LOCATION	, is somewhat removed from the crash and the din ; but even his sit - uation is not without its possibilities , and something in the form of fiction , or perhaps of most interesting diary or reminiscence , will be expected from him to show how far he has been awake to his enviable opportunities .

		THE LIBRARY AS PACIFICATOR has a duty to perform , as we are reminded by an editorial note in the current `` Quarterly Booklist '' of the
Pratt Institute Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, second only in importance to its duty as educator .

		Or perhaps the order of importance should be reversed .

		At any rate , the
Pratt Institute	ORGANIZATION	librarian holds that ' ' the Library is an instru - mentality for peace , '' and continues : `` Our recently published list of books dealing with the historical , social and economic issues that led to the European eruption is intended to be an argument for peace .

		Without infraction of ` neutrality , ' the exercise of private judg - ment as to the righteousness of the opposing contentions is encouraged by the extensive literature the
Library	ORGANIZATION	affords on both sides of the case .

		We invite open-minded reading that may lead to the ultimate conviction of the unrighteousness of war upon any pretext , and the futility of it as a means of deliverance from the ills of the world . ''

		The writer opti - mistically expects the forthcoming peace -LRB- when it does come -RRB- to be `` not a truce under arms , a calm of suspended hostilities , the quiet of exhaustion , the silence of repression , but the permanent abolition of warfare with all its paraphernalia . ' '

		If abundance of read - ing matter on subjects of war and peace could insure that desirable end , even a cursory glance at the array of such literature exposed to view in most of our public libraries would encourage hopes of a speedy dawn of a new era in the world 's history .

		A SET-BACK TO SIMPLIFIED SPELLING , in En - gland at least , is what the war seems in some measure to be , if one may judge from an `` editorial noet '' in the latest issue of `` The Pioneer ov Simplified Speling . ''

		Until the return of `` pees '' -LRB- good Chaucerian orthog - raphy , by the way -RRB- the paper will be published bi-monthly instead of every month .

		As a pos - 140 THE DIAL -LSB-

		* -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The novels of
Madame Marcelle Tinayre	ORGANIZATION	have received little notice from American critics , but have aroused considerable discussion in
France	LOCATION	.

		She is hailed by the feminists as a champion of their cause , a fact which may give her some title to interest on this side of the water .

		At least it is interesting to note the trend of her theories of woman 's rights . ''

		The only feminism possible , '' says a reviewer of her first work , '' Before Love '' -LRB- 1897 -RRB- , `` would be that which strives to keep woman in the unique religion of Love . ''

		Mme. Tinayre seems to have accepted the views of her critic , for her novels are a justification and glorifi - cation of feminine passion .

		The most interesting of her characters are her heroines .

		She says she has '' dreamed them in accordance with the ideal of an ancient poet , feminine body , heart of man , and head of angel . ''

		The reader may be inclined to regard them as romantic titans with a super - abundance of feminine body .

		Marianne , in '' Before Love , '' demands '' her place in the sun , and her right to love , '' by which she understands little more than the elemental privilege given by nature .


Jacqueline Vallier	PERSON	in '' The Ransom '' is a frivolous young woman aroused by illicit love to a sense of her responsi - bilities as wife and mother .

		The reader is a bit startled to see adultery seriously proposed as a school of ethics , and , contrasting the work with '' The Princesse de Cleves , '' in which the character of the heroine develops ^ through her victory over passion ; one is inclined to agree with Miss Repplier that our age is marked by a '' loss of moral nerve . '' ''

		The Storm Bird '' is the author 's weakest attempt .

		One critic has observed that it is the counterpart of ''
Madame Bovary	PERSON	, '' apparently because Mme.
Tinayre	PERSON	treats her erring provincial heroine with all tenderness , while Flaubert applies the sternest logic to
Emma Bovary	PERSON	. ''

		Helle '' is the story of the niece of a distinguished Hellenist who has edu - cated her according to principles of his own .

		His aim was to give to her , a woman , what the Renais - sance had brought to the men of the sixteenth cen - tury , liberation of the spirit from the chains of convention , social and religious .

		She is deeply read in the masterpieces of antiquity , and is thus led to an ideal of complete and harmonious devel - opment of character .

		She has been trained to be the peer and comrade of her husband , who is to be , as her uncle puts it , one who has known how to create in himself a demi-god .

		Introduced to Pari - sian society , she scandalizes the dear old ladies of another generation by revolting against the idea of * A detailed study of Mme.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 141 effacing her personality in love .

		She is at last united to a high-minded though rather pedantic social reformer , whose work she shares .

		Very much a woman and perhaps the most attractive of the author 's heroines , she is yet more a rebel than any of them , as her battle is for intellectual equality .

		Mme.
Tinayre	PERSON	's masterpiece , '' The House of the Sin , '' is not a thesis novel , though some critics would make it a diatribe against Christianity .

		It relates the struggle betAveen human passion and a fanatical Jansenism ; but the action rises naturally from the characters , and both sides receive fair treatment .

		Nowhere has the author succeeded in giving such a variety of uniformly convincing and well-drawn portraits . ''

		The Amours of Francois Barbazanges '' is a charming idyll which presents amid pathetic and comic incidents two clashing images of love , that of the so-called idealists -LRB- the scene is laid in the seventeenth century -RRB- , and that of the realists '' The Rebel '' is the maturest work of the author in the literature of revolt .


Josanne Valentin	PERSON	is an older sister of
Marianne	PERSON	, and a relative at least of
Helle	LOCATION	; she pleads her cause more passionately than either .

		She demands equality with man , and freedom in both emotional and intellectual spheres ; but in the working out of the story the emphasis is on liberty in passion .

		A question similar to that of ''
Tess	PERSON	of the D'Urber - villes '' is posed , but the conclusion is very different from Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's : '' Victory remained with love which had not despaired , with love strong as life . ''

		The best of the novel is the description of humble quarters of
Paris	LOCATION	, with their picturesque denizens , and of
Josanne	ORGANIZATION	's work as reporter for '' Le Monde Feminin , '' where the author seems to be drawing on her own experience as a journalist .

		The fault of the book is its over-stress on the thesis ; one feels that the characters , however living , are forced into subordination to it .

		The social order combat - ted by Mme.
Tinayre	PERSON	as the universal one , is reversed in her novels : woman holds the strings and man dances to her music .

		Slave of his slave becomes his doom , and the reader can not escape the impression of a decidedly abnormal state of society .

		The author 's latest books seem to be drawing away from '' problem '' studies .

		`` Mourning Love '' is a collection of short stories relating the suffering imposed by passion in different situations .

		Love is represented as an ' all-conquering force for whose loss there is no consolation but death . ''

		The Shadow of Love '' takes us to the author 's native province ,
Limousin	LOCATION	, and charming descriptions of this out-of-the-way region serve to lighten a dis - agreeable story .

		Mme.
Tinayre	PERSON	is at her best in portraying picturesque characters and landscape ; here
Limousin	LOCATION	gives her ample opportunity .

		The background of '' The Sweetness of Living '' is
Naples	LOCATION	; the subject is the effect of the voluptuous Italian sky on visitors from the north .

		The last book , '' Madeleine at the Mirror , '' is not a novel , but the reveries of a young widow .

		It is written in a rich poetic style , and , best of all , portrays a woman 's character so simply that we almost forget its complexity .

		Madeleine , not being a heroine of fiction , is permitted her share of sound judgment and some sense of humor .

		It is interesting to note that many of the author 's ideas will seem less revolutionary in
America	LOCATION	than in
France	LOCATION	of to-day .

		We are rapidly consenting to the re-division of social privilege , and are giving woman an equal part with man ; she receives prac - tically the same education , and can thus enter life 's struggle on equal terms with him .

		Marriage is more or less a partnership , in which both parties retain to a large extent their right of individual development , and in which sacrifices are divided .

		Other claims on which Mme. Tinayre insists more may be less acceptable .

		She regards passion as an universal and irresistible force , perhaps stronger in woman than in man .

		She comes perilously near demanding the application in favor of her sex of the '' wild oats theory . ''

		Herein lies a curious con - tradiction in her thought .

		Her heroines are con - stantly enslaved by the very passion they demand freedom to gratify .

		It is written of the rebel her - self : '' She is no longer
Josanne Valentin	PERSON	, she is woman before man , '' and she returns to elemental instincts in the embrace of her lover .

		If it is all to end thus , why so much ado ?

		Mme.
Tinayre	PERSON	's work shows some striking points of resemblance to that of George Sand .

		In both are found the passionate rebel , the socialist and the lover of picturesque landscape with its humble toil - ers .

		It may be hoped that this new titan , like her predecessor , will abandon theses , choosing defi - nitely to present new corners of
Limousin	LOCATION	and above all to portray character without bias .

		In her thesis novels , to put it brutally , there is too much that recalls Rabelais 's '' Et tout pour les tripes ! ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Those who hold to the belief , urged in your pages recently by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, that war and cultural progress are somehow inseparable are often fond of citing
Ruskin	PERSON	as a conspicuous cham - pion of their theory .

		And it is true that
Ruskin	PERSON	did believe that in the past war had been '' the foundation of all the high virtues and faculties of men . ''

		But of modern war , of war as it is being waged to-day , let us hear what he has to say .

		-LRB- The passage is to be found in the lecture on War re - printed in '' The Crown of Wild Olive . '' -RRB- ''

		If you have to take away masses of men from all industrial employment , to feed them by the labour of others , to move them and provide them with destructive machines , varied daily in national rivalship of inventive cost ; if you have to ravage the country which you attack , to destroy for a score of future years , its roads , its woods , its cities , and its harbours ; and if , finally , having brought masses of men , counted by hundreds of thousands , face to face , you tear those masses to pieces with jagged shot , and leave the fragments of living crea - tures , countlessly beyond all help of surgery , to starve and parch , through days of torture , down into clots of clay what book of accounts shall record the cost of your work ; what book of judg - 142 THE DIAL -LSB-

		That , I say , is mod - ern war , scientific war , chemical and mechanic war , worse even than the savage 's poisoned arrow . ''

		When one considers the hellish perfection to which '' chemical and mechanic '' war has been brought since
Ruskin	PERSON	's time , one can not but feel that even that supreme master of language would have been at a loss for words forcible and fiery enough to express his abhorrence of the '' insensate devilry '' of modern war .

		I , for one , can not but believe that he would have preferred to see all the great cultural treasures of the past perish like the manuscripts of
Louvain	LOCATION	or the painted glass of
Rheims	LOCATION	rather than that
Europe	LOCATION	should be devas - tated and tortured and impoverished and brutalized as is being done to-day .

		WHEN IS A NOVEL NOT A NOVEL ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Having been occupied with the reviewing of novels for some thirty years past , I may claim a certain acquaintance with the subject-matter of the above query .

		A circulating library called the '' New Fiction Library , '' having branches in many cities , publicly advertises its readiness to supply its customers in the following language : `` Any book of new fiction not in stock will be secured on the following day . ''

		For several weeks now I have been asking to be supplied with
Nexo	PERSON	's '' Pelle the Conqueror , '' and have been refused .

		At last comes a letter from the
New York	LOCATION	headquarters of the concern , stating as the reason for refusal that '' Pelle '' is not a work of fiction .

		This assertion is not only a ridiculous falsehood , but it comes with comical effect from a concern which supplies its customers with '' Jean-Christophe '' and '' The Re - volt of the Angels . ''

		A second reason adduced -LRB- as in the old story of the stolen kettle -RRB- , is that '' Pelle '' is in two volumes , '' which in itself would bar it from being placed in our library . ''

		But how about ''
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	, '' in three volumes ?

		Last of all , the real reason for the refusal is given : ''
Pelle	PERSON	is not a popular book of fiction , and would only be read once or twice . ''

		But this does not seem to be in accordance with the advertised promise , as above quoted .

		DID MILTON NOD ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the tenth book of '' Paradise Lost '' there occurs a textual difficulty to which I have never seen atten - tion called .

		It is in the account of
Satan	LOCATION	's second interview with Sin and Death , and has to do with the cosmic locality in which the poet would have his reader picture the parties .

		At the moment of the meeting Satan is represented as '' now returned to hell , '' 1 .

		346 ; and as being `` near the foot '' of the upright structure just completed by Sin and Death , 1 .

		348 .

		His location , therefore , as at or near Hell-gate , seems doubly indicated : -LRB- 1 -RRB- he has returned from
Earth	LOCATION	to his own abode ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- he is at the foot of a structure which rises from Hell to a point hard by the gate of Heaven .

		But in spite of this , some lines further on , as Satan is closing his speech , he is evidently not at the bottom , but at the top of the new viaduct .

		On it he pro- poses to descend to Hell , 1 .

		394 ; on it he does descend to Hell-gate , 1 .

		414 ; furthermore to reach the terrestrial paradise Sin and Death must de - scend , 1 .

		398 ; all three of them are '' near Heav - en 's door '' 1 .

		389 .

		Has the poet in closing the scene forgotten where he began it ?

		That seems incredible .

		Have we then just here evidence of inadvertence on the part of some amanuensis ' ?

		This also seems incredible , for there is no one word or phrase failure to catch which would account for the inconsistency .

		This passage -LRB- 330ff . -RRB-

		is of the greater impor - tance because of its bearing upon the problem of the correct location of the head of '' the new won - drous pontifice . ''

		Dr.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	, in his ''
Milton Primer	PERSON	, '' p. 87 , makes the structure ter - minate at '' the base '' of the newly created cosmos , while Professor
Masson	PERSON	and Dr.
Orchard	PERSON	carry it higher , even to the summit , hard by the foot of the Golden Heaven-stair .

		The parallelism in function between the celestial stair and the infernal bridge favors Dr.
Brooke	PERSON	's interpretation , but the passage before us is clearly against it .

		If any reader of THE DIAL will harmonize the data of this problem , he will surely place many students under obliga - tion .

		Even a conjecture should be of value .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The late Emperor ,
Meiji Tenno	PERSON	, as he is posthu - mously known , and the late Empress , were both proficient and prolific in the production of the famous Japanese short poem .

		The present Em - peror and Empress seem to be following in the footsteps of their predecessors .

		The following translations of some of their recent poems will indicate how their minds are occupied at the pres - ent time .

		The first three are by the Emperor ; the remaining two by the Empress . ''

		If life , for country 's sake men give , How shall dependent loved ones live ? '' ''

		ONE WHOM THE GODS TJOVEI > .

		* Not having a heart '' dry as
summer	DATE	dust , ''
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	was not one of those who are suffered to ' ' burn to the socket , ' ' but rather did he belong among those favorites of heaven to whom an early death is benign an tly granted .

		Five and forty years was his allotted span , and it sufficed him for such rare and exquisite self-expression in word and deed , in prose and verse and daily conduct , as will long be an inspiration to those qualified to appre - ciate what his too-short life and his too-modest contribution to literature stood for .

		Of these discerning few is his present biographer , Mr.
William Belmont Parker	PERSON	, who is also the editor of his collected poems , and who , as he tells us , more than ten years ago , in a burst of enthu - siasm and admiration , entered upon this more important task now so happily completed .

		When half-way through his work as originally planned , the author came under the influence of that master-biographer ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, and turned back to make his book as far as possible an autobiography of
Sill	ORGANIZATION	, drawing largely upon the latter 's correspondence and other writings for the purpose .

		For it was a dictum of
Stephen	PERSON	's that `` nobody ever wrote a dull autobiography , '' and that though `` the biog - rapher can never quite equal the autobiog - rapher , '' yet `` with a sufficient supply of letters he may approach very closely to the same results . ''

		Thus , while no one can tell how good Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's work as first con - ceived would have been , it is certain that the actual production , with its copious extracts from
Sill	ORGANIZATION	's unpublished manuscripts , epis - tolary and other , gives a clear and vivid im - pression of what manner of human being here confronts us .

		`` Like most American men of letters , '' the opening chapter begins , `` the author of ` Opportunity ' and ` The Fool 's Prayer ' was a native of
New England	LOCATION	. ' '

		Windsor , Connect - icut , was his birthplace ;
April 29 , 1841	DATE	, the date of his birth .

		He was a descendant of Presbyterian and Congregational ministers on his mother 's side , of physicians and surgeons on his father 's , and his ancestral tree is rich in
Walcotts	LOCATION	, Grants ,
Edwardses	LOCATION	,

Rowlands	PERSON	,

		Early left an orphan ,

Boston	LOCATION	:

		in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and finally at
Exeter	LOCATION	, that he spent the years devoted to preparation for
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, whence he was graduated at twenty .

		A voyage to
California	LOCATION	then followed , and half a dozen years of changing occupations in that new land , after which came marriage , a brief taste of theological study at the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	, six weeks of journalism in
New York	LOCATION	, two years of high-school principal - ship and superintendency of schools at Cuya - hoga Falls , twelve of teaching in
California	LOCATION	, including nine years in the chair of English at the
State University	ORGANIZATION	, and , finally , from
1883	DATE	until his death in
1887	DATE	, literary pursuits at Cuyahoga Falls with no daily grind of reci - tations and lectures .

		But from his college days to the end Sill was addicted to writing , with brilliant success in competition for aca - demic honors , biat apparently never with any consuming desire to see himself in print .

		On this point he said of himself in later life , in writing to an editor and friend : '' I do n't think other people feel the way I do about that .

		When a thing is written , they have a trembling hope , at least , that it is good , and any - how wish to have it used .

		But you should see the equanimity with which I write thing after thing both prose and verse and stow them away , never sending them anywhere , or thinking of printing any book of them , at present , if ever .

		Sometimes I do think I will leave a lot of stuff for some one to pick out a post-humorous volume from but more and more my sober judgment tells me that other people have seen or will see all that I have , and will state it better . ''

		This lack of eagerness for public fame both contributes to the charm he exerts over us and helps to account for the veil of anonymity he chose to throw over much of his best literary work .

		It was in the unpretentious ' ' Contribu - tors ' Club '' of the magazine edited by his friend
Aldrich	PERSON	that he most frequently ap - peared in his choice bits of unsigned prose , and it was in the same monthly periodical that he first came somewhat conspicuously into public view as a poet .

		Even as a poet of whose merit
Aldrich	PERSON	delighted to regard himself as the discoverer , Sill would fain have remained unknown by name .

		He writes to the editor : '' I like the anonymousness of the Contribu - tors ' Club .

		Would you not as soon print poems for me unsigned ? ' '

		Occasionally he was permitted to use a pen-name , partly to avoid any seeming excess of his verse in the maga - zine .

		On the subject of pseudonymity occurs this characteristic utterance in one of his let - ters to Aldrich : '' It may be said but a man would be in danger of printing -LRB- or offering for print -RRB- things that he would have made better if his own name were to go with them .

		No , I think not .

		If he had a perma - 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 4	DATE	nent mask he would be more sensitive about this even than his own proper face , and would do his best for it . ''

		Significant of his modesty and of his un - willingness to bear the responsibility of any - thing short of the best possible in his art , is the fact that only one slight volume , `` The Hermitage , and Other Poems , '' was given by him to the public ; what else we have from his pen in book form is of the posthumous sort which he wittily but not quite accurately chose to regard as `` post-humorous . ''

		This anxious concern about the products of his pen appears again and again in his correspondence so often as possibly to arouse a suspicion of mock modesty , unjust though such a suspicion must be held by his admirers and it is found in an amusing form in a letter to
Aldrich	PERSON	that is worth quoting , in part , at this point , largely because it shows how far the writer had strayed from the rigid orthodoxy of his Pres - byterian ancestors .

		He writes , under date of
June 9 , 1885	DATE	: '' Do you want to do me a great favor ?

		I do n't know in the least what your proclivities -LRB- or declivi - ties -RRB- are in the way of religious matters , but I am going to assume that yours are not far away from mine enough to ask you , if you are naturally in the way of seeing manuscripts , submitted to the firm for publication , to look into an essay I sent them -LRB- with some others -RRB- entitled ' The XlXth Cen - tury ' along toward the end of it and purloin certain pages treating of the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	as a nuisance and a fraud if it is likely , otherwise , to be read by some members of the firm -LRB- I do n't in the least know who or what they are -RRB- some very conservative , elderly , religious , sensitive , choleric , old-fashioned gentleman with gold-spectacles and high collar , and a pew in church and gold-headed cane who hates
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	and
Herbert Spen	PERSON	- cer -LRB- by reputation -RRB- and loves
Joseph Cook	PERSON	.

		Is there such a fearful catastrophe imminent as that such a man should read my essay and be made really ill by it ? ''

		Almost twenty years earlier the conviction had begun to force itself upon Sill that he could never be other than a non-conformist , that he must live his own life and think his own thoughts in entire independence .

		Hence , in part at least , the severing of his connection with the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, where in his day a free-thinker was not exactly a persona grata .

		Hence also , still earlier , his departure from
Cambridge	LOCATION	and his farewell to the study of theology .

		`` There could be no pulpit for me after going through there , '' he says , `` ex - cept as an independent , self - supported minis - ter , which of course is open to any one with a purse .

		I came reluctantly to that conclusion .

		Another person , even with my opinions in theology , might have judged differently .

		It is no sentimentalism with me it is simply a solemn conviction that a man must speak the truth as fast and as far as he knows it truth to him .

		I may be in error but what I believe is my sacred truth , and must not be diluted .

		When I get money enough to live on I mean to preach religion as I believe in it .

		Emerson could not preach , and now I under - stand why . ''

		Hence , once more , his inability , as a mere youth , to conduct himself as a model student at the hide-bound
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	of his day ; and in the light of his subsequent devel - opment one is not surprised to find him chafing under meaningless restraint , breaking arbi - trary rules , and rusticated at the end of Freshman year for neglect of college exercises , which included perfunctory and undevotional chapel attendance sixteen times a week .

		Of
Sill	PERSON	's variety and brilliancy of endow - ment we get a hint from the testimonies of classmates printed in the biography .

		Gov - ernor
Baldwin	PERSON	, of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, finds written in his diary of those student days : `` We have n't got much of a class , but
Sill	ORGANIZATION	is some - what of a genius , to be sure . ''

		Before his first year of college was half completed this was the general verdict concerning him .

		Another classmate recalls that `` despite his slight fig - ure , he had a beautiful rich bass voice ; and he had , of course , as lyric poets must have , a genius for music .

		He could play on any in - strument he took a notion to , with very little practice .

		Yet I do n't remember that he sang in the choir .

		Perhaps he would have been apt to refrain in those rebellious years , because of distaste for the service . ''

		It appears that at one time he thought seriously of training him - self to become an organist .

		That was in the first
California	LOCATION	period , when also he came within a little of adopting the stage as his profession , and when too he made trial of the law -LRB- or gave some thought thereto -RRB- , of ranch - ing , of bank-clerking , of post-office work , for a season coquetted with the notion of studying medicine , and doubtless turned his eager and active mind in many other more or less prom - ising directions besides .

		As an actor or as a musician there is reason to believe he might have won distinction ; as an expounder of the ' ' nice sharp quillets of the law ' ' he would have been a ludicrous misfit ; and as a healer of the sick he would , despite his gentleness , his sympathy , and his tenderness , have rebelled against the monotony and the drudgery of the calling .

		As already intimated , the author has done well to let Sill tell most of his own story , and to withhold , so far as the present work is con - cerned , such excursions in `` essay and criti - cism '' as had been included in his first plan .

		The real
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	was what his
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 145 lovers were waiting for , and this is what Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's book , written with the sanction and help of
Sill	ORGANIZATION	's relatives and friends , and well provided with portraits and other illustra - tions , now faithfully presents .

		* When the new
Hall of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	was opened in
1911	DATE	, two rooms were allotted to Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	in which to house the dramatic museum it had long been his ambition to establish .

		The larger of these rooms now con - tains a dramatic library of several thousand volumes ; a considerable proportion of which are the gift of Professor
Matthews	PERSON	himself , while the smaller has been set apart for the exhibition of an historical series of models , illustrating the successive stages in the devel - opment of the drama from the days of the Greeks to the present time .

		Many of these models have already been installed ; a few , such as the Palladian Theatre at
Vicenza	LOCATION	and the theatre built by Richelieu in the
Palais	LOCATION	- Cardinal , await a patron 's bounty , all the models displayed being the gifts of individ - uals .

		Although still incomplete , this excep - tional museum contains in miniature the Athenian Theatre of Dionysus , a platform of a French mystery play , a pageant-wagon of an English mystery , a platform in a Tudor inn yard , a stage-set of the Italian comedy of Masks , a multiple-set at the Hotel de
Bour	PERSON	- gogne and the Fortune Theatre , a fairly com - plete historical series with which to make plain to the student the development of the drama from the days of the Greeks to the time when
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, inspired by Italian mask com - edy , created the modern drama .

		No true student of the stage will gainsay the practicality of this museum .

		Indeed , as Professor
Matthews	PERSON	says in his prefatory note to its catalogue ' : '' In so far as the drama is within the limits of literature it can be studied in a library ; but in so far as it is outside the limits of literature , it needs for its proper understanding a gallery and a museum , containing the graphic material which will help the student to reconstruct for himself the conditions under which the masterpieces of the great dramatists were originally performed the * PUBLICATIONS OF THE DRAMATIC MUSEUM OF

		conditions in conformity with which they were composed . ''

		With this pronouncement all those who really know the stage and its functions will agree ; for although we may read dramatic master - pieces while sitting in a comfortable library chair , we should not forget that they were written to be seen , on the stage .

		In other words , unless we can visualize the size and arrangement of the theatres in which they were played , as well as the character of the audiences to which they made appeal , we can - not rightly estimate the work of such masters as
Sophocles	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and Gol - doni .

		As an aid to this necessary visualiza - tion , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's museum stands unique .

		The
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	possesses certain models illustrating plays it has pro- duced ; while at the
Clara-Ziegler Haus	PERSON	in
Munich	LOCATION	, there is a museum showing the his - tory of the German stage ; yet neither of these chauvinistic collections , nor the Museo Teatrale in the Scala Theatre at
Milan	LOCATION	, shows the successive stages in the development of the drama throughout the world .

		To perform this latter function is the aim of the
Dramatic Museum of Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , an institution which should right - fully have been called the
Brander Matthews Museum	ORGANIZATION	, so entirely is it the creation of its founder .

		The Professor of Dramatic Litera - ture at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has not been content , how - ever , to confine his efforts to those of the librarian or curator ; the same reverence for professional stage-craft which led to the estab - lishment of his museum as a laboratory for his students having inspired the publication of several series of papers to be known as the Publications of the
Dramatic Museum of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of these , re - cently published by subscription in an edition of three hundred and thirty-three copies , con - sists of four neat little volumes on the art of play-making , comprising respectively : `` The New Art of Making Plays , '' by
Lope de Vega	PERSON	, translated by Professor
William Tenney Brewster	PERSON	, with an introduction and notes by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; `` The Auto - biography of a Play , '' by
Bronson Howard	PERSON	, with an introduction by Mr.
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	; `` The Law of the Theatre , '' by
M. Ferdinand Brunetiere	PERSON	, translated by Mr.
Philip M. Hayden	PERSON	, with an introduction by Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	; and ' '
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	as a Dramatist , '' by Sir
Arthur Wing Pinero	PERSON	, with an introduction and a bibliographical appendix by Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	.

		Although his name appears here solely as author of the introduction to one of these booklets .

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	is as en - 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 4	DATE	tirely the originator and editor of these pub - lications as he is the founder and curator of a dramatic museum in the catalogue of which he is not recorded as functioning in any capacity whatsoever , a self-effacement nota - ble in an age when the rays of the lime-light are sought even by college professors .

		Turning from this exceptional modesty to the four enlightening volumes Professor Mat - thews has edited , it may be said forthwith that here is both solid shot and canister with which to rout the ardent enthusiasts whose self-imposed task is to `` uplift '' the drama .

		Indeed , with the exception of
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	, the authors of these papers on play-making may be classed as commercial dramatists , who believe that the function of the theatre is to please and not to preach .

		As Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	writes the introduction to this single exception to Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's rule that papers on play-making should be written by makers of plays , the voice of the practical man may be said to be raised even here .

		Moreover , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's scintillant introduction quite eclipses in interest
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	's didactic holding of his pet thesis that a play `` is the spectacle of a will striving toward a goal , and conscious of the means which it employs . ''

		In contravention of this theory , Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	has insisted that a play is a crisis not a conflict .

		But Mr.
Jones	PERSON	frames a law of his own .

		`` Drama arises , '' he says , `` when any person or persons in a play are consciously or unconsciously ` up against ' some antagonistic person , or circumstance , or fortune . ''

		Whether a drama be a conflict , a crisis , or a case of `` up against it , '' is of minor impor - tance , the elusive art of play-making being to hold the interest of an audience .

		To place a person or persons in a play `` up against '' something that will get over the footlights is the problem that confronts the dramatist , and it matters little whether that something be defined as a conflict or a crisis , provided it be novel enough to excite interest or human enough to inspire sympathy .

		Moreover , the test of the box-office is also the test of time , since a play that does not appeal to its own age sufficiently to gain at least a respectable hear - ing will not live long enough for posterity to become aware of its existence .

		Knowing his contempt for the closet-drama , one suspects Professor
Matthews	PERSON	of having published these instructive papers on play - making in order to confound the `` high - brows , '' for the voice of the successful dra - matist inevitably conjures up the spectre of ` Commercialism .

		Listen to
Lope de Vega	ORGANIZATION	, as .

		commercial a dramatist as ever wrote : '' True it is that I have sometimes written in accordance with the art which few know ; but , no sooner do I see coming from some other source the monstrosities full of painted scenes where the crowd congregates and the women who canonize this sad business , than I return to that same bar - barous habit , and when I have to write a comedy I lock in the precepts with six keys , I banish Ter - ence and Plautus from my study that they may not cry out at me ; for truth , even in dumb books , is wont to call aloud ; and I write in accordance with that art which they devised who aspired to the applause of the crowd ; for since the crowd pays for the comedies , it is fitting to talk foolishly to it to satisfy its taste . ''

		The authorship of some two thousand or more plays is attributed to this same
Lope de Vega	PERSON	.

		yet his name spells Spanish drama .

		As Pro- fessor
Matthews	PERSON	says , in his introduction to Lope 's ' ' New Art of Writing Plays , '' `` it was he who made the pattern that
Calderon	PERSON	and all the rest were to employ . ' '

		Here is the pat - tern drawn by this master craftsman : '' Do not spend sententious thoughts and witty sayings on family trifles , ... But when the char - acter who is introduced persuades , counsels , or dis - suades , then there should be gravity or wit ... If the king should speak , imitate as much as possi - ble the gravity of a king ; if the sage speak , observe a sententious modesty ; describe lovers with those passions which greatly move whoever listens to them ... Let him -LSB- the playwright -RSB- be on his guard against impossible things , for it is of the chiefest importance that only the likeness of truth should be represented ...

		In the sec - ond weave together the events , in such wise that until the middle of the third act one may hardly guess the outcome .

		Always trick expectancy ; and hence it may come to pass that something quite far from what is promised may be left to the under - standing . ''

		To study further the laws of dramatic con - struction , except in practice , is largely futile ; since , in the words of the late
Bronson How	PERSON	- ard , `` when all the mysteries of humanity have been solved , the laws of dramatic con - struction can be codified and clearly ex - plained ; not until then . ''

		Yet this lamented American has himself framed a vital law of construction in his edifying `` Autobiography of a Play . ''

		`` A dramatist , '' he holds , `` should deal so far as possible with subjects of universal interest , instead of with such as appeal strongly to a part of the public . ''

		Realizing , as have all successful dramatists , that a stage appeal must not be made to `` hearts here and there , '' but to `` a thousand hearts at once , ' ' he reaches the logical conclu - sion that ' ' love of the sexes is most interesting to that aggregation of human hearts we call the audience . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL , 147 To
Lope de Vega	PERSON	's epitome of the art of play-making and
Bronson Howard	PERSON	's sane rule of selection should be added Sir
Arthur Wing Pinero	PERSON	's definition of strategy as `` the general laying out of a play , '' and tactics as `` the art of getting the characters on and off the stage , of conveying information to the audience and so forth . ''

		To complete this vade-mecum for the playwright , it is necessary to turn to La Critique de I ` ficole des Femmes , a dramatic polemic written by Moliere to confound the `` high-brows '' of his day .

		In scorn of their `` rules made only to embarrass the ignorant and deafen the rest of us , '' Moliere thus frames the one universal law , not only of the drama , but of every art : '' I should like to know whether the great rule of all rules is not to please , and if a play which has attained that end has not travelled a good road ?

		Can the entire public be mistaken , and is not each one capable of judging of the pleasure he receives ? ''

		The drama is the most democratic as well as the most contemporary of the arts ; its appeal being made not to people of the future but to those of the present , not to one class but to all .

		If a play pleases the public of its own time , has it not , as
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	says , travelled a good road ?

		Moreover , can the entire public be mis - taken ?

		This question is answered by Sir
Arthur Wing Pinero	PERSON	in his paper on ' '
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	as a Dramatist . ''

		`` The in - stinct , '' he says , `` by which the public feels that one form of drama , and not another , is what best satisfies its intellectual and spiritual needs , at this period or that , is a natural and justified instinct . ' '

		A dramatist may rise to a moral plane as high as the ideals of his public , or debase his talents to the limit of police toleration ; but he can not disregard the instinct of which Sir
Arthur	PERSON	speaks , without failure as the penalty .

		It should be apparent , therefore , that if in a particular age this instinct is either vicious or crass , the public , rather than the stage , needs `` uplifting , '' a ` task for the accomplishment of which a cohesion of all the moral elements in the community , rather than the ardor of a few zealots , is required .

		Another pertinent lesson in stage-craft is taught by Sir
Arthur Wing Pinero	PERSON	in his analysis of the failure as a dramatist of so dramatic a novelist as
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The prizes of the dramatist were to
Steven	PERSON	- son 's thinking `` out of all proportion to the payment of the man of letters '' ; therefore the theatre was `` a gold mine , '' upon which to keep his commercial eye .

		However , he failed to secure its ingots , because , as Sir
Arthur	PERSON	says , `` he played at being a playwright . ''

		The art of play-making , which the eminent dramatist just quoted so aptly defines as `` compressing life without falsification , '' is too serious an art to play with .


Stevenson	PERSON	approached the dramatic gold mine believing he had only to scratch the earth in order to disclose the ingots .

		These , alas !

		lie far be - neath the surface .

		Only by infinite patience and skill may they be unearthed .

		To the novelists who share
Stevenson	PERSON	's con - tempt for the drama , as well as to the enthu - siasts engaged in elevating it , the admirable booklets Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has modestly issued in the name of his pet achieve - ment are recommended as pertinent reading .

		Papers on the art of acting by
Talma	LOCATION	,
Coque	PERSON	- lin ,
William Gillette	PERSON	, etc. , are to be added in the autumn to these publications of the Dra - matic Museum of

		EUROPEAN TRAVEL , IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY .

		* If not quite a pioneer in the rich field of early European travel , Professor
Mead	PERSON	is one of the first to work systematically therein .

		Miss
Howard	PERSON	's `` English Travellers of the Renaissance , '' Mr.
Bates	PERSON	's `` Touring in
1600	DATE	, '' and most other detailed studies have dealt mainly with the sixteenth and seven - teenth centuries .

		Babeau 's `` Les Voyageurs en
France	LOCATION	, '' though covering about three cen - turies , is limited to one country .

		Professor
Mead	PERSON	has therefore limited himself to the eighteenth century , with an occasional glance backward and forward , and .

		in the nature of things , to those countries -LRB-
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, Ger - many , and the Low Countries -RRB- which were generally included in the conventional grand tour .

		Foreign travel for the avowed purpose of education of becoming `` the complete gen - tleman '' may be said to have begun in Elizabethan times , and owing to the heavy expense involved was limited to the upper classes .

		With occasional interruptions due to war , the stream of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	travel contin - ued , and in the eighteenth century travelling became , relatively , so easy that large numbers of young Englishmen were constantly to be found in the great centres of the countries chiefly visited .

		So numerous , indeed , did they become that it was not easy for a Briton to * THE GRAND TOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY .

		This , however , did not seriously trouble many Englishmen , who cared little about learning foreign lan - guages .

		The indifference of Englishmen to the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	vernaculars has always been marked .

		It was of course a far different
Europe	LOCATION	that the eighteenth century tourist saw from that of to-day .

		It was the
Europe	LOCATION	of pre-Revolu - tionary days , before the social order had been transformed .


France	LOCATION	had not yet got away from the fatal centralizing policy of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.


Spain	LOCATION	was `` in full decadence . ''


Italy	LOCATION	was at the lowest ebb of her decline ; ' ' no man could take pride in the name of Italian . ''


Germany	LOCATION	was slowly recovering from the Thirty Years ' `` War , and was `` inert and un - progressive , feudal in spirit and practice , and everywhere divided against itself . ' '

		The Low Countries alone were on the whole free and prosperous ; except
Belgium	LOCATION	, whose commer - cial expansion was blocked by
Holland	ORGANIZATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		The impression left by Professor
Mead	PERSON	's chapters on
Water Travel	ORGANIZATION	, Roads ,
Carriages	LOCATION	, and Inns is that tourists were courageous to travel at all .

		The railways have completely revolutionized travel ; by making it easy to get over the country they have vastly in - creased the number of travellers , and thus have forced an improvement in accommoda - tions and at least a partial change of heart on the part of innkeepers , who now real - ize how essential it is to make travellers comfortable .

		Before the advent of steam , how - ever , travel both by land and by water was `` no unmixed delight . ''

		In
1787	DATE
Arthur Young	ORGANIZATION	spent fourteen hours between
Dover	LOCATION	and
Calais	LOCATION	.

		On the Continent travel by water was much more common than now .

		One could go from
Paris	LOCATION	to
Lyons	PERSON	by water -LRB- ten days , thirty-five livres , or about
$ 6.75	MONEY	-RRB- ; the water journey from
Lyons	PERSON	to
Avignon	LOCATION	alone required three days .

		To avoid the Alps , many preferred the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	trip from Mar - seilles or Nice to
Genoa	LOCATION	, even with its possi - bility of sea-sickness and its danger of capture by the dreaded Barbary pirates .

		In Ger - many the Rhine , the Elbe , and the
Danube	LOCATION	were utilized as far as possible , and in the Low Countries water travel was well organ - ized .


James Edward Smith	PERSON	says that the con - venience and pleasure of travel in
Holland	LOCATION	and
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	`` can hardly be conceived from description . ''

		Land travel was scarcely less difficult than in former times , and was vastly more tedious than now .

		French roads were better than Italian .

		Naples had practically no roads at all except that which led to
Rome	LOCATION	, and this was in winter so bad that `` one ran great risk of being swallowed up in the mud-holes . ''

		German roads were notoriously bad ; improve - ments did not begin till
1753	DATE	.

		In
Nugent	PERSON	's time -LRB- about 1756 -RRB- post wagons made about eighteen miles a day .

		` In
Hanover	LOCATION	, as late as
1826	DATE	,
John Russell	PERSON	reports , scarcely outside the gates the wheels of the coach sank up to the axle-tree .

		Unless one could afford one 's own vehicle , one travelled in the diligence a vehicle which grew in massiveness until those used by
Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	were '' as large as an ordi - nary load of hay , carried twenty or thirty passengers , and weighed five tons . ''

		Many preferred the post-chaise , which was more expensive .

		From
Calais	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- thirty - two posts -RRB- a single post fare in
1756	DATE	cost about
$ 21.75	MONEY	; two could do it for
$ 31.50	MONEY	.

		Private coaches were very expensive .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	one could travel `` with post-horses ; with a vet - tura or hired coach or calash in which they do not change horses ; and , finally , with a procaccio or stage-coach that undertakes to furnish passengers and necessary accommoda - tions on the road . ''

		The German post wagon was much more clumsy and unwieldy than the French , and went only about three miles an hour .

		The inns left much to be desired , and their wretched condition compelled travellers to take much more luggage -LRB- both linen and pro- visions -RRB- than is necessary to-day .

		Beds were likely to be damp and dirty ; there were only the most primitive sanitary arrangements .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	especially the food , except in the large towns , was often poor or ill cooked ; and as
Smollett	PERSON	remarks , a common prisoner in the Marshalsea or King 's - Bench was more cleanly and commodiously lodged than travellers were in many places between
Rome	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Yet in spite of these drawbacks , the attrac - tions of travel proved too strong to be re - sisted .

		In the ' ' Letters Concerning the Present State of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1772 -RRB- it is said that `` where one Englishman travelled in the reigns of the first two
Georges	PERSON	, ten now go on a grand tour . ''

		The number who travelled chiefly for the purpose of improving their minds and gaining -RCB- intelligence , however , does not seem to have been relatively very great .

		Few were well prepared to reap the maximum advantage from foreign travel .

		At the university a man `` could not avoid picking up the rudiments of Latin and Greek and some bits of information about ancient

		often disgracefully ignorant . ''

		Many still favored the plan of sending boys abroad in care of a tutor ; but the number of competent tutors was small indeed .

		Attempting some generalizations , Profes - sor Mead thinks that the average English tourist was incompetent to form a judgment of the people of the Continent . ' '

		Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the ordinary run of English travellers was their insularity and their unreadiness to admit the excel - lence of anything that was unfamiliar . ''

		Yet Englishmen who chose to be popular on the Continent were often remarkably so .

		They `` had a reputation for fair dealing , and for keeping their promises . ''

		Likewise Englishmen were unable to esti - mate fairly the art and architecture of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		`` To many an Englishman
Italy	LOCATION	was interesting chiefly as a vast museum of antiquity which enabled him to vivify his recollections of the classics . ''

		Addison at once occurs to those familiar with his travels , as of this class .

		On such men the glories of mediaeval Gothic made no impression .

		The change of attitude which took place toward mountain scenery in the eighteenth century has been often commented upon .

		St.
John	PERSON	's view , as late as
1787	DATE	, is typical of many : '' Far off lay the mountains of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, forming a most awful and tremendous amphithea - tre .

		When first I turned my glass upon them , if I may so express myself , and brought their terrors closer to my eye , I started with affright !

		... Per - haps on approaching , and having them continually in view , they would not appear so dreadful as at first ; but even yet at so great a distance , I could not behold them through a glass without terror . ''

		Gray was one of the first to admire mountain scenery , and there seem not to have been many who followed him , at least for a long time .

		The failure to appreciate the Alps , the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	, and - the
Apennines	LOCATION	was probably due to two things : first , men 's preoccupa - tion with `` the proper study of mankind '' ; and secondly , the difficulties experienced in traversing these barren and forbidding re - gions .

		As these difficulties gradually dimin - ished , Gray 's delight in the sublimity of mountain scenery found an echo in many hearts .


William Coxe	PERSON	wrote to his friend
William Melmoth	PERSON	in
August , 1776	DATE	: '' I have now visited the sources of three great rivers in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and traced their impetuous progress through a tract of country , in which nature has exhibited the grandest and most
august	DATE	of her works .

		But it is impossible adequately to describe these majestic and astonishing scenes !

		In description they must all appear nearly the same ; yet , in fact , every river , cataract , rock , mountain , precipice , are respectively distinguished by an infi - nite diversity of modifications , and by all the possi - ble forms of beauty , magnificence , sublimity , or horror .

		But these discriminating variations , though too visibly marked to escape even the least observ - ing eye , elude representation , and defy the strong - est powers of the pen and pencil . ''

		Yet with all his obtuseness and his inability to make the most out of his opportunities , the Englishman must have got more out of his travels than we generally give him credit for .

		We are accustomed , following Matthew Ar - nold and some others , to think of
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	as a singularly obstinate and conservative person .

		Yet we shall have to admit that in
Britain	LOCATION	new ideas have made steady if slow progress .

		The most flexible of British minds
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Burke	PERSON	, Arnold himself have been leaders of many .

		The success of British colonial policy in these latter days shows that
Burke	PERSON	's view has at length pre - vailed ; and we can not help thinking that something of this change of attitude is due to the observing British travellers who have penetrated to the ends of the earth .

		And if for a few years following the present war the English and the Germans could frankly ex - plore each other 's country -LRB- forgetting all about spies -RRB- , it is safe to say that there would never be a repetition of the crime that is now being perpetrated on the innocent bystanders of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Mead	PERSON	has succeeded in producing a volume which is both entertaining and of high scholarly value .

		Typographically the book leaves nothing to be desired ; and the eleven illustrations have been well chosen .

		We dislike to have all the notes relegated to the back ; nothing of importance is gained , and hunting for the notes where they are wastes too much time .

		There is an adequate bibliographical note -LRB- supplementing
Pinker	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , and a good index .

		CHARACTER-READING THROUGH THE FEATURES .

		* Since Aristotle 's day , at least , men have diligently searched for a key with which to let themselves into the inner life of their fellows ; and no subject of study seems to have been so fascinating and at the same time so elusive as this one .

		The ancients sought to solve the great mystery by comparing the features of man with those of animals , ' on the principle that likeness in features denoted similarity in * CHARACTER READING THROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE FEATURES .

March 4	DATE	intellectual and temperamental traits .

		They assumed , for instance , that a man with a leonine brow must have a lion 's characteris - tics , while a man with a canine brow must have the traits of a dog .

		This mode of ap - proach to the secrets of character has been the favorite one , though not the only one , all the way down to our own day .

		Mr.
Fosbrooke	PERSON	's `` Character Reading through Analysis of the Features '' is based in part on this conception , and in part on the doctrine that a particular formation of features denotes a special sort of intellect and type of character .

		But the au - thor does not depend entirely on analysis of the features in a strictly anatomical sense .

		At times he bases his `` reading '' on the expres - sion of the features , rather than on their form , size , and relation .

		The frontispiece is a pic - ture of a woman , and bears the title , ' ' Con - centration . ''

		It is evident that the author intended the reader to get the idea of concen - tration from the expression of the woman 's face , the lines of strain in the brow and about the eye , and from the attitude of her body ; and not from the size and shape of her nose , ears , or chin , the color of her eyes and hair , the construction of her lips , or any other anatomical characteristic .

		The sketches for the various types of each feature are unusually good .

		The impression which a hasty turning of the leaves makes upon one is that there will be some interesting secrets revealed in this book , and that stu - dents of human nature will get suggestions from it which they can utilize in classifying people .

		But the critical reader will be disap - pointed when he comes upon Plate I. , for this is a reproduction of the conventional phreno - logical chart in which all the varied faculties of the soul are localized in the left hemisphere of the brain .

		What the right hemisphere is used for is a mystery about as profound as the other mysteries discussed in the book .

		A dozen or so of the faculties , such as `` lan - guage , '' `` form , '' `` size , '' `` weight , '' `` color , '' `` order , '' and `` calculation , '' are located over the left frontal sinus and below the left eye .

		The author says that the `` bump '' theory in character-reading was exploded years ago ; and yet he endorses this phrenological chart , and relies upon it in his analysis of concrete cases in the latter part of the book .

		It seems extraordinary that in the light of modern research on the brain anyone should locate `` ideality , '' `` sublimity , '' `` hope , '' '' spiritu - ality , '' `` veneration , '' and `` conscientious - ness '' in the upper middle region of the left hemisphere .

		It has been shown literally hun - dreds of times that this is the general motor region which regulates the movements of the dextral half of the body .

		If one should be injured in the left hemisphere where the chart localizes ' ' spirituality , ' ' he would be paralyzed in the right leg .

		He probably would not have any more or any less spiritu - ality than he had before .

		If one should ex - pose this area and stimulate it , the right leg of the subject would respond ; but there would be no spiritual demonstration whatever .

		But the most amazing feature of this phreno - logical chart is the location of the language faculty underneath the left eye .

		Modern research has shown that the vocal language centre is in the middle motor region of the left hemisphere .

		The visual language centre is in the occipital lobe .

		The graphic language centre is differentiated out of the general right-hand centre in the left hemisphere , and the auditory language centre is in the audi - tory region of the brain .

		How anyone in these times can continue to befuddle the lay - man by pretending to read linguistic ability from an examination of the topography of the region below the left eye is inconceivable .

		There are many conflicting statements in the book , although no more than in any book which attempts to delineate character on a physiognomical basis .

		One may read that a certain face shows in the forehead `` reflective and perceptive formation , ability to reason from cause to effect , good comparative powers , natural knowledge of human nature , construc - tive and executive ability , reverence , firmness , and a love of approbation , a desire to learn , power of judgment as to size and weight , mental order well developed resulting in a good memory .

		Eyebrows show indications of irritability , the eye shows observation , pene - tration , and intellect .

		Upper eyelids show selfishness , self will , and self satisfaction . ' '

		What little progress psychology has made in trying to differentiate the characteristics and powers of individuals has led to the view that the strongly reflective type of person , one who has marked ability in reasoning from cause to effect , is likely to be lacking in execu - tive ability .

		Again , the psychologist has been able to show that there are as many kinds of memory as there are kinds of perceptions and ideas , and to say that the forehead shows that one has a good memory is indeed humorous .

		Often in this book one reads that the forehead shows lack of concentration , while the nose shows just the opposite , the lips something else , and the chin still something different .

		What kind of a theory of mind can a person have who believes that mental characteristics are revealed in anatomical traits , when differ - ent traits suggest diametrically opposite abilities *
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 151 If those who are engaged in an attempt to develop a science of character-reading would take their cue from
Darwin	LOCATION	, they might in time give us something which would be of service ; but when they base their ' ' readings ' ' upon phrenology and physiognomy , they are certain to lead their followers into blind alleys .

		Darwin showed that the fundamental emotions are revealed in characteristic muscu - lar movements and adaptations of the body as a whole , and of the more mobile parts of the face , hands , etc. .

		These muscular activities were once of service in the struggle for exist - ence , and they have persisted even down through human life in more or less modified and complicated forms .

		Darwin also showed that certain of the very general intellectual traits , such as attentiveness and concentra - tion , are revealed in specific muscular adapta - tions ; and the frontispiece in Mr.
Fosbrooke	PERSON	's volume illustrates this very well .

		But no man has ever shown any connection whatever be - tween the expression of the eyes , the lips , etc. , and particular types of thinking , as in phys - ics , chemistry , psychology , philosophy , his - tory , etc. .

		And still there are many persons who imagine that every intellectual activity is revealed in some kind of characteristic tension or adaptation of some or all of the features .

		A large proportion of American people have apparently not yet grown out of their superstitious feeling about the reading of character .

		They still think that someone has discovered the connection between every `` attribute of the soul '' and the construction and expression of the features .

		Superstitious people of this sort read the analyses of fea - tures such as appear in books like the one under review , in which a great multitude of the most general activities , abilities , and attributes are enumerated ; and they will feel that they are in the presence of a great revela - tion of subtle truth , when they are really only being plunged deeper and deeper into confu - sion .

		The author is probably not under as great an illusion as his readers will be , for in his chapters on `` How to Read Faces '' and `` The Knowledge of Physiognomy and Its Uses '' he does not make a definite statement applying his own principles , though he does this for the concrete types presented in the last chapters of the book .

		But how can any - one test the accuracy of his analyses when they concern only imaginary persons designed by the artist ?

		It may be added that the artist has done his work admirably , and that the book is at - tractively made on the physical side .


M. V. O'SHEA	PERSON	.

		A SKETCH OF THE ENGLISH DRAMA .

		* Professor
Schelling	PERSON	is so well known as an authority on Elizabethan drama that one ap - proaches his treatment of that field with assurance , knowing that even if it were noth - ing more than a condensation of his large work on the subject it would be well worth while .

		The chief question concerns his treat - ment of the later periods , in which the whole subject of English drama is so much less at - tractive , and has been so much less put in order by scholarship , than in its greatest age .

		Here , also , it may be said at once , there is little but praise called forth either by Profes - sor
Schelling	PERSON	's judgments in themselves or by his frank but urbane manner of pronouncing them .

		In respect to the matter of proportion , however , some greater doubt may be felt .

		Ad - mitting the immensely preponderant interest of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods , the dreariness of English drama in the neo - classical age , and the still tender youth of the fresh growth of the form in our own time , yet to give substantially two hundred pages out of 330 to the matter from Lyly to
Davenant	PERSON	, and but forty to the entire eighteenth cen - tury , with some sixteen for the nineteenth , is open to question .

		The really large product of the eighteenth century in serious literary drama , while of course of no corresponding intrinsic excellence , leads the student to de - sire some careful consideration of it , if for no other reason than to explain its limitations .

		The great value of the important portion of the book , that dealing with what may be called Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's own period , is the topi - cal analysis of the rich material it affords , according to which the several types , such as romantic comedy , the `` drama of everyday life , '' and the like , are separately accounted for with brevity and sureness .

		This is the method of the author 's large work , ``
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan Drama , '' and in that instance it has sometimes been found troublesome because of the effect in separating rather widely matters chronologically akin ; but in a book of the present compass there can be little question of its usefulness .

		And the writer has not permitted himself , even where so great con - densation was demanded , to make his chapters mere lists and summaries , without distinction and individuality of style .

		On the contrary his agreeable personality is almost always present .

		Witness such an obiter dictum as this : '' In our own time the example of Everyman has begotten a progeny of contemporary plays , and created , even on the popular stage of
England	LOCATION	and * ENGLISH DRAMA .

		It is referable , like our modern shudder at the robust punishment meted out to the Jew , to our emasculated contemporary sentimentality that hab - itually meddles with clumsy hand to interpose between human acts of folly and criminality and their logical consequences . ''

		Another fine passage is on the relation be - tween
Ford	ORGANIZATION	and that modern romanticism whose faith is `` in the divine guidance of passion ' ' ; but there is the less need to quote this because it is found in substantially the same form in the earlier and larger work .

		Readers familiar with Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's criticism will be prepared to guard themselves unless they be of the same school against his disposition to teach that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	could do no wrong .

		This is evidently not due to mere traditionalism , but to a truly devout and one must admit an intelligent faith in the methods of the great master 's art .

		Yet it sometimes leads to results dubious at best .

		If Professor
Schelling	PERSON	, for instance , finds the conclusion of `` Measure for Measure '' ethi - cally satisfying -LRB- see page 100 -RRB- , he differs not only from
Coleridge	PERSON	, who called it `` a hate - ful work , '' but surely from very many of us .

		In ' ' Othello ' ' he seems to find a certain poetic justice of the old-fashioned sort -LRB- page 133 -RRB- , which again is at least questionable .

		And once more he refuses assent -LRB- page 186 -RRB- to that view of Shakespeare 's latest plays which recognizes a certain falling off in dramatic power , though this may now fairly be called the orthodox view , and to the present writer seems indisputable .

		The bibliographical material in this volume is by no means so rich as in the author 's sim - ilar volume on the Lyric , in the corresponding American series ; but this is due to no fault of his , but to the plan of the general editors .

		Despite this , he has managed to include , in a number of valuable footnotes , apparatus sure to be very useful to the serious reader .

		The index is of the wholly mechanical and almost wholly useless sort ; but this again is obviously the fault of the publishers .

		Nor is the proof - reading impeccable , though better than in Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's volume in the same series .

		Par - ticularly distressing is the punctuation , whether due to unusual theories on the part of author or printer one can not say .

		When all is said of such details as these , whereon we critics thrive , this book remains a really notable achievement in the packing into small compass , by methods at once scholarly and humane , of much riches .

		Few living men doubtless no one else in
America	LOCATION	could have done this special task so well .

		And it may be observed that while certain of these type-subjects the lyric for instance , are rather ill adapted to consecutive historical treatment , in the manner of the present series , the drama is of just the opposite character .

		It thrives in some sense as an organism , rather than in isolated individuals .

		The study of causes , effects , and quasi-biological relations , is nowhere more significant .

		It would be well if we could have , one day , a new edition of this volume , including a study of the recent development of English drama made with the same care which has been be - stowed on the golden age of its youth .

Miss Rose Strunsky	PERSON	courageously essays the task of worthily picturing to us the veritable
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the man of the people , `` the apostle of true democracy , '' and of placing in a new and true historical perspective both the man and his time .

		`` While it is beyond dispute that
Lincoln	LOCATION	is so great a man , so noble a figure in history , and from manifold points of view so attractive a personality , that we can hardly have too many faithful and well-written ac - counts of his life , it is also not to be denied that already more than one able pen has traced without serious distortion the features of this perennially interesting man and shown with some clearness his abiding significance in our national history .

		Although Miss
Strun	PERSON	- sky declares that `` the truth is we have not been taught how to tell of his life , '' many of us were of the impression that no ignoble attempt to achieve that end was to be found in the ten volumes of Nicolay and Hay 's great work , as well as in such less elaborate under - takings as

Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' and , by no means least of all , the late
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	's capti - vating volume , `` The Every-Day Life of Abraham Lincoln . ''

		What Miss
Strunsky	PERSON	would lay emphasis on , however and it is an aspect of the subject not to be overlooked is the moulding influence of his environ - ment and his time in the production of the leader demanded at that particular period and in those peculiar circumstances .

		`` We can not tell his life by speaking of his life alone , '' she truly says .

		`` We were looking for
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 153 our old-time hero of the sagas , and here came along one who made the people hero , '' she further tells us , and again : `` We speak of one who was no more or less than the execu - tive and administrator of the will of the peo - ple .

		Whatever were the ideals and desires and faults of the common people of his day were the ideals and desires and faults of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	. ''

		This is paring down his native genius and force , his distinct individuality , rather unduly , and is making of Lincoln an opportunist and a time-server instead of a leader and the champion of a cause .

		The writer makes not slavery but `` property in land '' the real cause of the Civil War .

		Yet the southern plantation system would have been impossible without slavery , and thus the latter must still bear the responsibility com - monly ascribed to it .

		Speaking of what the present-day American is striving for , the au - thor closes her book with this reading of the signs of the times : `` Behind the aegis of Lincoln he is advancing towards the new order of social control small capitalistic and closely-knit together . ''

		Is it so certain that the day of large industrial and financial operations is near its sunset ?

		The book , in - telligently planned , agreeably written , and provided with half a dozen appropriate illus - trations , is a welcome though hardly an epoch-making addition to the literature of its inexhaustibly fertile theme .

		Humors of peculiarities of the Scottish the Scottish character show themselves no - where more unmistakably than in the clash of wits that takes place in a Scot - tish court of law .

		Hence the fund of amusing anecdote and character-sketch that such a book as `` Some Old Scots Judges '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , by Mr.
W. Forbes Gray	PERSON	, is likely to contain .

		It is not a work of laborious biographical re - search , but rather an entertaining compilation from such sources as
Cockburn	PERSON	's `` Memorials of his Time , ''
Ramsay	PERSON	's ``
Scotland	LOCATION	and Scots - men , ''
Kay	PERSON	's `` Edinburgh Portraits , '' and
Knight	PERSON	's `` Monboddo and his Contempora - ries , '' with such editorial touches as serve to set the several characters in their proper per - spective and give a sufficient unity and pro- portion to the volume .

		Here we have , for instance , the bluff , unpolished Lord Braxfield airing his broad humor and his broader dia - lect on the judicial bench . ' '

		Hae ye ony coon - sel , man ? ''

		he asks of
Maurice Margorot	PERSON	, brought before him on a charge of sedition . ' '

		No , ' ' was the laconic answer . ' '

		Dae ye want to hae ony appointit ? ''

		he continues .

		`` No , '' is the sarcastic rejoinder , `` I only want an interpreter to make me understand what your lordship says . ''

		It was the same incorrigible Caledonian who said of young
Francis Jeffrey	PERSON	, fresh from
Oxford	LOCATION	and beginning his profes - sional practice at the Scottish bar , ' ' The laddie has clean tint his Scotch and fund nae En - glish . ''

		To
Jeffrey	PERSON	himself , in due time raised to the bench , the author devotes one of his most readable chapters .

		It is significant to find the man who , as first editor of the `` Edinburgh Review , '' misjudged the poetic genius of others , equally at fault in estimating his own endowment as a writer of imperish - able verse .

		`` I feel , '' he wrote to his sister , `` I shall never be a great man unless it be as a poet . ' '

		In addition to the celebrities already named , the book has sketches of Lords Kames ,
Monboddo	LOCATION	,
Gardenstone	PERSON	,
Hailes	PERSON	,
Eskgrove	LOCATION	,
Balmuto	LOCATION	,
Newton	LOCATION	,
Hermand	PERSON	,
Eldin	LOCATION	, and Cock - burn all of the later eighteenth and earlier nineteenth centuries .

		Portraits of all are pro- vided , and an unusually full index closes the book , which may be confidently commended to the lover of biographical anecdote and well - considered terse characterization .

		A study of musical psychology .

		In his clearly written and en - tertaining book , `` The Musical Faculty '' -LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
William Wallace	PERSON	endeavors to consider , in its abstractness as a part of the musician 's inner equipment , the conscious activity which pro- duces music .

		The noun in the title indicates the point of view from which the book is writ - ten .

		We had supposed that this was a phase of speculation somewhat overworn .

		The iso - lating of a section of the consciousness , and the elaborate treatment of this abstraction , leads generally to rather shadowy results .

		We are inclined to believe that there is no such thing as a musical faculty ; but that the whole man , his entire development and achievement , all that he is and knows , go to the produc - tion of his aim , in this case , an expres - sion in sound of some profound insight or some overmastering experience .

		Nevertheless , this is a book full of interesting if not new analyses of various aspects of musical phe - nomena .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	maintains that the ear - lier composers had no individual development ; they showed no growth in their compositions ; their later works , like their earlier ones , were built upon the same model , and showed the same tonal characteristics .

		With Beethoven the break with the old was made ; he aban - doned his forerunners , and set sail upon the unfathomed sea on which the argosies of the bold musicians of to-day are navigating , bound for ports never dreamed of before .

		The question appears in every art form to-day , and yet the orthodox sonata in
Beethoven	LOCATION	's hands 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 4	DATE	was the medium of utterance for ideas not sur - passed by any of his successors .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	analyzes the intellectual equipment of the `` wonder child '' who seems to know every - thing in music when wholly immature in all other directions .

		He concludes that there is something occult here which as yet entirely exceeds our understanding .

		He describes the nervous apparatus at the basis of music ; he deals with the mental hearing of music , as in the case of a deaf musician ; the extraordinary power of inhibition or concentration required of the musician ; the character of musical memory ; and the vast command of multitudi - nous resources demanded of the modern leader of the orchestra .

		He discusses at length the problem of musical heredity , and has small respect for the theories usually advanced on the subject .

		He considers the great musician as a representative person at the highest point of human development , and combats the no - tion that the so-called `` genius '' invariably possesses a diseased consciousness and is al - ways an abnormality .

		The book is provided with a useful bibliography , a satisfactory in - dex , and contains a great deal of material that is valuable .

		A score of great names are .

		selected by Professor
Edwin `` Watts Chubb	PERSON	, in his `` Masters of English Literature '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , to repre - sent seven of the eight periods into which he conveniently divides that literature .

		Those periods are : the Anglo-Saxon or Early En - glish , the Middle English , the Elizabethan , the Puritan , the Restoration , the Age of Classicism , the Age of Romanticism , and the Victorian Age .

		The Anglo-Saxon period he leaves unrepresented , for obvious reasons , in a popular treatise such as he has prepared ; to illustrate the others we have Chaucer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- whose name Professor
Chubb	ORGANIZATION	prefers to write in almost its briefest possible form -RRB- ,

Pope	LOCATION	,

Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Car - lyle ,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		A brief biographical sketch and a generously appreciative rather than severely critical account of his works are given under each writer 's name , the whole being preceded by a brief Preface and an introductory outline of English literature as divided into the fore - going periods , and interspersed with frequent short quoted passages , while bibliographical references at the end of each chapter point the student to more extended sources of in - formation .


George Eliot	PERSON	, the one woman writer on the list , has a compliment paid to her apophthegmatic quality which is not paid even to
Johnson	PERSON	or
Carlyle	LOCATION	; that is , a selec - tion of pithy sayings beginning with , `` Blessed is the man who , having nothing to say , refrains from calling attention to the fact '' is made from her books and ap - pended to the section headed by her name .

		In his opening paragraph the scholarly author allows himself a little indulgence in what seems not exactly like scholarly restraint , the scholar 's preference for understatement , when he says that `` one could collect several hun - dred definitions of literature or religion . ''

		It would be a task for most of us to collect a dozen of each .

		What one likes most in this attractive book from an ardent lover of `` the best that has been said and thought in the world '' is the contagion of enthusiasm for that `` best '' which its pages spread .

		Mr.
Hubert Howe Bancroft	PERSON	's fheAzt d ecl .

		`` History of
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Bancroft Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a revision , with exten - sion to the
summer of 1914	DATE	, of his work pub - lished twenty-eight years ago , `` A Popular History of the Mexican People . ''

		The im - penetrable obscurity enveloping the origin and early history of the Mexican aborigines is acknowledged at the outset by this sixty-years student of the subject , and he claims little that is new for his opening section on the pre - Spanish period of Mexican history .

		The re - maining five sections of the work deal with the Spanish conquest , the viceregal or colonial period , the war for independence , the period of national existence to the downfall of
Maxi	ORGANIZATION	- milian , and the later course of events to the abdication of
Huerta	LOCATION	, with a concluding chap - ter on the country 's general conditions and natural resources .

		Not wanting in contemp - tuous sarcasm is the historian 's treatment of recent American policy toward
Mexico	LOCATION	, but he formulates no alternative course as a remedy for existing ills , though he does say toward the close : ' ' Out of the predicament there ap - pears for the
United States	LOCATION	one of two courses : open , inglorious retreat , or conquest , protec - tion , and dismemberment . ''

		The latter mode of cure , however , he hardly seems to favor when he says , a little earlier : ' ' Three special years of infamous treatment they had had at the hands of their own countrymen , and now the foreign invader is at their door to bring them happiness in the form of thirty years more of war and bloodshed , for without this and more the promised pacification will never come to pass . ''

		It would have added to the book 's value as a handy work of reference , and would have made its substance easier of mas - tery , if dates had been given in the table of contents , or in the chapter-headings or page -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , headings , or occasionally in the margin year dates , we mean , as some avoidable uncer - tainty arises from too frequent mention of months and days of the month in the text , with no year at the top of the page or else - where for ready reference .

		This fault , it should be added , is partly corrected by the appending of a `` chronological table of the rulers of
Mexico	LOCATION	, and dates upon which they assumed office . ''

		Maps and illustrations abound , and in general the work is very ser - viceable and also agreeably readable .

		impressions ^ selection of
M. Pierre Loti	PERSON	's of things out of slighter sketches , of various dates , appears in excellent trans - lation under the title `` On Life 's By-ways '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book presents in pleasing form the French naval officer 's impressions of things seen in different parts of the world to which ' ' the exigencies of a seafaring life , ' ' as he expresses it , have at various times called him , together with a brief chapter on
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	as man and friend , and another on
Michelet	PERSON	's book , `` The Sea . ''

		With exquisite art the gifted Frenchman makes one expe - rience with him the varied and novel sensa - tions evoked by varied and novel sights and sounds in divers quarters of the globe in
Senegal	LOCATION	, on
Easter Island	LOCATION	, in the Basque coun - try , in
Madrid	LOCATION	, and under the shadow of the great Sphinx .

		Of unusual interest to an American are the pages written at the Spanish capital soon after the outbreak of our war for the liberation of
Cuba	LOCATION	, or , as this sympathizer with
Spain	LOCATION	phrases it , in `` the early days of the American aggression . ''

		The charges of perfidy and atrocity there brought against us bear an interesting likeness to the charges now so vehemently urged against one or another of the belligerent nations by the opposite side .

		Warmly espousing the cause of his hospitable entertainers , the writer paints a touching pic - ture of the sad-eyed Queen Regent in those distressing days .

		Now and then , through the impressionism of these vividly descriptive chapters , one gets a glimpse of the author 's philosophy of life , a philosophy not always so admirable as the style in which it is clothed .

		After witnessing , with proper loathing , the abhorrent spectacle of a Spanish bull-fight , the writer thus lightly dispels the shameful vision : ' ' Then , remembering that only what constitutes physical beauty , the charm and delight of the eye , does not prove deceptive , I turned my gaze away from the arena and looked up at the beautiful senora , dressed in light blue , and wearing on her head a white mantilla and in her breast a bunch of tea roses . ''

		A description of the barren dreari - ness of
Easter Island	LOCATION	, taken from a notebook of early youth , but subjected to some needed revision , is the most remarkably arresting piece of writing in the book .

		It alone would justify the volume 's existence .

		The compe - tent translator of these well-selected sketches is Mr.
Fred Rothwell	PERSON	, who also contributes a finely appreciative preface .

		Africa 's largest island is a thou - in
Madagascar	LOCATION	, sand miles long , three hundred and more broad , and contains 230,000 square miles somewhat larger than all the

Fifty Years ' Intimate Association	ORGANIZATION	with the Natives and Study of the Animal and Vegetable Life of the Island '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- contains this in - formation , and a great deal more .

		It is the work of the Rev.
James Sibree	PERSON	, F.R.G.S. , a missionary who has written extensively about his theatre of operations .

		The book is in - tended rather to be enjoyed than to be studied , and is made up of informal accounts of a num - ber of journeys made in the island .

		Precise scientific terms are little insisted upon , native names are given wherever possible , numerous reproduced photographs heighten the interest of the text , and result in a substantial octavo packed with knowledge imparted cheerfully .

		As the principal haunt of the interesting lemurs and of most of the chameleons , with a fauna and flora sufficiently distinct from that of the mainland to heighten investiga - tion , as well as being the home of several sorts of humankind , apparently compounded in various degrees of Melanesians and Negroes , the island is abundantly worth the time and space here devoted to it , and is rapidly assum - ing importance since its conquest by the French nearly twenty years ago .

		Told as it is in an intimate and gossiping manner , the volume makes excellent reading , and conveys the idea that the author has led a long , happy , and interesting life , crowded with strenuous duties cheerfully performed .

		Qf greategt menaces o f human life is dealt with in a competent man - ner .

		Medical research in ever-increasing vol - ume is being directed to the solution of this problem ; but it remains a problem as yet un - solved , both as to the cause of cancer and to any effective cure .

		The less technical conclu - sions thus far arrived at indicate that inheri - tance of cancer holds no special element of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
March 4	DATE	alarm , that the contagiousness or infectious - ness of cancer is far from proved , that danger of its accidental acquirement is slight , and that care and attention to diet and hygienic surroundings are of utmost importance ; that cancer is local in its beginning , and when accessible it may in its beginning be removed so perfectly by radical surgical operation that the chances are overwhelmingly in favor of its non-recurrence .

		The book is abundantly illus - trated , has an extensive bibliography , and holds a mine of technical information on the theories as to the cause of cancer , the course of the various types of the disease , and the various methods of treatment and so-called `` cures . ''

		There is also a plea for scientific -RRB- statistics and a campaign of public education to protect sufferers from the dread disease by prompt surgical treatment .

		We note the omission of
Boveri	ORGANIZATION	's very important contribu - tion -LRB- possibly too recent for inclusion -RRB- to the etiology of cancer derived from the study of abnormal cell divisions .

		Dr.

Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- hardly calls for comment on the origi - nalthe bible of the architects of the

Morgan	PERSON	, through the editor -LRB- Professor
A. A. Howard	PERSON	-RRB- , and through Professor
Warren	PERSON	, who has prepared the illustrations .

		These advantages , together with the picturesque and characteristic En - glish in which Professor
Morgan	PERSON	has managed to preserve the flavor of the original , make it doubtless the definitive translation .

		The illus - trations show a comparison of the prescrip - tions of Vitruvius with actual classic exam - ples , usually those which correspond most nearly to them .

		The notes which Professor
Morgan	PERSON	had intended , both textual and ex - planatory , he did not live to supply , but the translation and illustrations by themselves are sufficient to be of very great interest both to architects and to scholars .

Capitaine Gabriel de Libert de Flemalle	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Danish correspondent to the

		After mentioning that , before the war ,
Germany	LOCATION	had shown an almost insatiable appetite for translations of foreign books , he adds that a leading German publisher has just an - nounced that he has done with
Gabriele d'Annun	PERSON	- zio .

		According to this publisher ,
d'Annunzio	PERSON	has attacked

		Lord
Cromer	PERSON	has written a supplementary vol - ume to his `` Modern Egypt , '' which will be pub - lished this month by Messrs.

Tewfik Pasha	PERSON	, in
1892	DATE	, and
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	's departure from
Egypt	LOCATION	in
1907	DATE	.

		Lord
Cromer	ORGANIZATION	's view of
Abbas	PERSON	's character was obtained at close range , and was quite as unfavor - able as its subject deserved .

		Lord Cromer and Abbas never '' got on , '' for , indeed , it was hard to respect the ex-Khedive either as a man or as a ruler .

		The work of
Stijn Streuvels	PERSON	, the Low-Dutch author who is regarded both in
Belgium	LOCATION	and Hol - land as among the most distinguished writers of our time , is to be introduced to English readers by Mr.

West	LOCATION	- Flemish dialect under the title of `` The Web of Life . ''


Stijn Streuvels	PERSON	's real name is
Frank Lateur	LOCATION	.

		Until ten years ago his home was at Avel - ghem , close to
Courtrai	LOCATION	and the Lys , where he earned his living as a baker . ''

		The Web of Life '' belongs to that period .

		Mr.

Margaret d'Angouleme	PERSON	. ''

		This time , 158 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		Margaret was not only the author of the '' Heptameron '' but the patroness of a group of men of letters that included
Rabelais	ORGANIZATION	,
Clement Marot	PERSON	, and
Bonaventure des Periers	PERSON	, and the influence of her Court makes one of the most fascinating chapters in the history of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		If any of the friends of
John Muir	PERSON	have missed his Alaskan dog story , '' Stickeen , '' they should by all means look it up .

		Its general circulation would go a long way in reducing the residuum of cruelty to animals which man seems to have brought down with him from primitive savagery .

		Since its origi - nal publication , a few years ago , the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	have included it in their '' Riverside Literature Series , '' printed in large type and neatly bound in cloth , for only
twenty-five cents	MONEY	.

		It is a story which children and grown-ups alike will read with intense interest , and all friends of dumb ani - mals ought to assist in promoting its circulation .

summer of 1899	DATE	, and published in book form in the following year . '' '


Carlyon Sahib	PERSON	' and ` Andromache , ' '' writes the author , '' were really companion studies of two views of life , the two that we now associate with the names of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	respectively , although at that time I do not think I had heard of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	.

		` Andromache ' shows a Tolstoyan heroine living and eventually prevailing in a primitive society based upon re - venge and force ; '
Carlyon	PERSON	' a kind of superman hero trying , and eventually failing , to find scope in modern civilization . '' ''

		Like many other readers , '' says a writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation , '' '' I have been trying to keep up with the deluge of books about the war , or at any rate , to miss nothing of importance which would help to a better knowledge of the greatest event in contemporary history .

		But a glance through
Messrs. Lange & Berry	ORGANIZATION	's annotated bibliography , ' Books on the Great War , ' just published by
Messrs. Grafton	PERSON	, has almost driven me to give up the attempt .

		I find that , excluding reprints , pamphlets , poetry , sermons , and so forth , more than a hundred and eighty books on the struggle , all of them with some claims to attention , have been published since the beginning of
August	DATE	.

		And if a reader had gone through all these , he would still be faced by the heading ' Poetry , Songs , and Plays , ' with nearly fifty entries ; ' Religion , Sermons , Prayers , and Hymns , ' with more than seventy ; and ' Humor , ' with a score , to say nothing of the mountain of pamphlets .

		If the output continues at this rate and it shows no signs of slackening future historians who take account of all the mate - rial will need to be long-lived men .

		Historians , by the way , have lost no time .

		More than a score of histories are chronicled by
Messrs. Lange & Berry	ORGANIZATION	, the most important being
M. Gabriel Hanotaux	PERSON	's ' Histoire Illustree de la Guerre de
1914	DATE	, ' which is appearing in monthly parts . ''

		233 THE DARKENED FOREGROUND .

		In the
Altman	PERSON	collection of the Metropolitan Museum in
New York	LOCATION	there is a magnificent specimen of the work of the great landscape painter Ruysdael .

		In the foreground of the painting , where in Nature -LRB- for it is mid-day or thereabouts -RRB- everything would be the clear - est and most distinct ,
Euysdael	PERSON	has thrust a broad wedge of night .

		There is a road , there are some fallen trees , a few figures ; but scarcely anything can be distinguished .

		Why did the artist do this ?

		Well , on either side of this darkened space slope rye fields which we feel we could wade through if we could reach them ; in the rear is a farmstead with trees peaceful and alluring and absolutely true in tone and scale ; and back of all is the real dome of the sky , with rising clouds as magnificent as have ever been drawn by man .

		By falsifying his foreground ,
Ruysdael	PERSON	secured all the other truths of his picture .

		In an art so various as painting it is foolish to generalize .

		It is possible in depicting inte - riors , those builded by either nature or man , to plunge the foreground objects into light and get some sort of distance by means of lurking shadows behind .

		It is possible to throw a veil over everything , and thus shirk the presenta - tion of strong light and shade .

		It is possible to paint decoratively with harmonies of colors which have little relation to reality .

		There are new schools in painting which reject the imitation of nature altogether .

		But in the main the method which Ruysdael so boldly dis - plays in this picture is the method of painting .

		Compared with the infinite variety of nature 's illumination , an artist 's pigments are so dull that if he puts the real hues in the front of his picture he will have exhausted all his grada - tions of tint before he reaches his middle dis - tance , and will have nothing at all left for his background or sky .

		So he `` fakes '' his fore - ground , and lies about the nearest and dis - tinctest visibilities .

		Painting is confined , or ought to be confined , to one moment and one division of space .

		Lit - erature introduces duration and a multiplica - tion of spaces , and is therefore immensely more complex .

		But we think that there is in the 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	best literary art something analogous to the painter 's principle of darkening the fore - ground .

		Literature 's poverty of resource as compared with life is even more apparent than that of painting .

		There are something like thirty million seconds in a year , and each one of them may be productive of an emotion or a situation .

		Every personage in a piece of lit - erature must pass through innumerable scenes ; but only a few of these scenes can be given .

		To get proportion , vividness , reality , the writer must select his moments and his locations properly .

		To get distance , large - ness , vision , he must more or less obscure his foregrounds .

		That a vast deal of modern literature has followed an exactly opposite principle , has dealt only with the near and the new , is nothing to the purpose .

		A vast deal of mod - ern literature , judged by the work which has lasted , is wrong .

		Take , for example ,
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's enormous novel , `` War and Peace . ''

		It has been called an epic ; but it precisely contra - venes every epic law .

		It is all foreground .

		Each figure in it is painted as distinctly as every other .

		When we try to call it up in memory we can only think of a confused med - ley , with no one figure or scene emerging dis - tinctly .

		It is a wonderful work of genius in detail ; but a bound volume of a newspaper would have almost as much claim to be called a work of art .

		The sooner we recognize that life and litera - ture are separate businesses the sooner we shall begin to produce something worth while in the latter field .

		Life is huge , confused , hap - hazard .

		Accident , sickness , death , the peril of the elements , thrust into it .

		The contradic - tory and the unexpected make up a large part of its happenings .

		Unless there is some ob - scure law of evolution guiding it , there seems to be no direction and no purpose except the very definite determinations to live , to work , to strive , to enjoy , to exhaust itself .

		A piece of literature is small , ordered , disciplined .

		It bears the law of its maker 's nature .

		It bor - rows its material from life , and of course it may react enormously on life .

		It is its mak - er 's report of some part of the vast phantas - magoria of life , his judgment upon it , and perhaps his vision of something different from it .

		The main point is that it subjects the med - ley of life to a certain discipline .

		At first blush it might seem that comedy is an exception to the rule of art 's separation from life and from the principle of the dark - ened foreground .

		Comedy is , though not essentially yet in usual practice , a contempo - rary creation .

		It steps right off from the street .

		Yet take the greatest comedy the last century produced , that of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		The grime , the gloom , the squalor of
London	LOCATION	, are used to set off his gigantic figures of fun .

		The principle of contrast is invoked , and out of their almost unbearable conditions
Micawber	PERSON	.


Sairey Gamp	PERSON	,
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	, the Wellers , and a hundred more rise in a riot of animal spirits ten times more living than life .

		The light , bright comedy of Meredith is weak and unsub - stantial in comparison .

		It may be objected that the gloom and squalor of
London	LOCATION	existed , and that
Dickens	PERSON	merely painted what he saw .

		But he undoubtedly put more of them in his prescription than life 's recipe would call for .

		And he might have ignored them altogether , as did Meredith and most of the rather watery humorists and novelists who have followed him .

		But he exaggerated , as all great artists have done .

		The hostess of the inn which was the supposed scene of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's `` Jolly Beg - gars '' protested that hers was a perfectly respectable house and that no such crew of tatterdemalions had ever gathered there .

		The lady suffragists of
Athens	LOCATION	probably hated Aristophanes for his three woman comedies , and the priesthood of
France	LOCATION	certainly hated Rabelais .

		Comedy at its greatest is an upset - ting and irreverent thing , and uses a great deal of lampblack .

		Even in the ideal comedy of Shakespeare there is plenty of shadow , and the principle of contrast is maintained .

		The tempest and the wreck precede
Ariel	PERSON	and
Miranda	PERSON	and the voices of the island .

		The Jew sharpening his knife comes before the moonlight scene at
Belmont	LOCATION	.

		The unjust brother , the jealous Duke , and the wrestling - match are a prelude to the forest loves and friendships of
Arden	LOCATION	.

		Tragedy in literature , if it is to be effective , must of course be removed and separated from ordinary life .

		In its thrilling moments on the stage they darken the house to bring out the full effect .

		We should probably laugh at a great deal of tragedy if it was not carefully prepared for , and solemnized by its surround - ings .

		How little the tragedies of life , of course barring our own , impress us !

		Every morning newspaper has a score , a hundred of them to report .

		We glance at the head-lines , yawn and toss the sheet aside .

		It takes an
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 193 earthquake , a holocaust , to move us a little .

		Yet an artist can take one of the least incidents in the news and by properly subordinating other things to it can win us to sympathy and tears .

		A certain remoteness and loftiness are necessary to the greatest tragic effects .

		Make your hero a king , said
Aristotle	PERSON	, and then peo - ple will sympathize .

		Either we do not feel that ordinary life is good enough for tragic trappings , or we secretly believe that we are princes and princesses who have been changed in the cradle and so only sympathize with our kin .

		Here , too , of course , the modern spirit has tried to nullify the teaching of ages .

		Democracy has wanted to be tragic , as it has wanted all other good things .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	have shown us the plots and per - plexities that attend the lives of the great suburban class .

		Dostoieffsky has revealed to us the fortunes and fates of criminals .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has tried to lift up those trodden flowers of the world ,
Tess	PERSON	and
Jude	ORGANIZATION	.

		But we are entirely unconvinced that these creations , charming or powerful as they may be , will per - manently or even for a time usurp the places of the kings and captains and great ladies of Shakespeare or
Scott	PERSON	.

		The human instinct for believing the best of itself is against them .

		Even in contemporary popularity , their mak - ers are beaten out of the field by novelists like Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	and
Miss Corelli	PERSON	, who do , in a way , put their trust in princes .

		Poetry , absolute poetry , must be more or less removed from life , it must keep its dis - tance .

		It does keep its distance by means of a special language , a special movement and ordering of words , an atmosphere of its own .

		With its purple robes , its round of gold about its brow , its inspired air , it becomes ridiculous when it steps down into the forum or the drawing-room , - among men clad in tweeds or women in
Paris	LOCATION	fashions .

		The vulgar can not understand it ; they would indeed have to be born again to enter its heaven .

		It is for the young and unspoiled , for the solitary enthusi - asts , for the dreamers brooding over the secrets of the universe .

		That is the reason why politi - cal poetry is such a doubtful good , and why humorous poetry is almost a contradiction in terms .

		The best poetry , too , has its foreground shadow .

		There is a good deal to be said for
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's theory that melancholy is the highest poetic motive .

		Joy may be , and indeed almost always is , vulgarized , but sadness can never be vulgarized .

		We have now gone the round , and may get back to
Ruysdael	ORGANIZATION	's picture , which we hope we have shown has a lesson in it not only for painters but for literary artists .

		Nay , it is not without a bearing on morality .

		The
Delecta	PERSON	- ble Mountains and the fair skies are generally separated from us by a bar of shadow , strug - gle , suffering .

		`` Can you have all this and heaven too ? ''

		said
Lyman Beecher	PERSON	's rustic parishioner , as to his shocked eyes were re - vealed the horsehair sofa , the marble-topped table , and the plush-covered album of the min - ister 's parlor .

		Modern life and art and litera - ture , womanized , have tried to put light and joy into the foreground .

		But it wo n't do !

		We must work through shadow into glory ; we must earn our kisses by kicks ; we must run the gauntlet before being acclaimed a warrior .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LATE LIBRARIAN OF THE HISPANIC SO - CIETY ,
Winfred Robert Martin	PERSON	, whose recent death has called forth glowing tributes to his virtues and talents , was evidently the strong - est possible contrast to the typical book - custodian of olden times .

		But how could he have failed to be , sprung from a father of such varied and unusual gifts as those possessed by the Rev.
William Alexander Martin	PERSON	, who survives his son ?

		The elder
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's mis - sionary and diplomatic services in
China	LOCATION	, and his published works in English and Chinese for he both speaks and writes the latter diffi - cult language have won for him a more than local distinction .

		A similar or even wider range of interests and aptitudes is to be noted in the son , whose skeleton biography in `` Who 's Who '' shows him to have been a
Princeton	LOCATION	graduate , of the class of
1872	DATE	; a bachelor of law ,
New York University	ORGANIZATION	; a doc - tor of philosophy ,
Tubingen	LOCATION	; a doctor of laws ,
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	; professor of oriental lan - guages at
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	from
1888	DATE	to
1907	DATE	; instruc - tor in Sanskrit at the
Hartford Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	from
1902	DATE	to
1907	DATE	; librarian of the
Hispanic Society of America	ORGANIZATION	from
1907	DATE	until his death ; and member of various American and foreign learned societies .

		But first and last he seems to have been preeminently a teacher , a kindler of zeal for knowledge in the breasts of others , as is plain from the testi - mony of his former pupils and of those who came into inspiring contact with him else - where than in the classroom .

		In the sixth chapter of Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	's `` Teaching in School and College '' occurs this 194 -LSB-
March 18	DATE	attesting passage : ' ' The teacher must not be a mere hearer of recitations .

		He should not exclusively confine himself to discovering whether or not the pupils have made sufficient preparation .

		In many of our recitations at school and college we never expected to learn anything ; never did , anyhow : we simply an - swered formal questions .

		So fixed was this idea in our minds , that our first interview with a new instructor in the
Hartford High School	ORGANIZATION	, Mr. ``
Winfred R. Martin	PERSON	, one of the greatest teachers I ever knew , was not only disastrous to us , but we nearly broke out into open rebel - lion .

		He asked us things that were not in the notes !

		Later we found him a constant and powerful inspiration .

		Even at that early age we obtained from him a notion of the meaning of true scholarship .

		He was and is a profound and original scholar , a man of varied and amazing learning , and we respected him for it . ''

		UNDERDONE ENGLISH might be a good term to apply to those alien words that elbow their way into our speech without showing any like - lihood of ever becoming naturalized in spell - ing or pronunciation .

		Ennui , for instance , will never be thoroughly English , and as long as we have tedium and boredom it will not be needed .

		Wanderlust , which we still write with an initial capital , in the German manner , and usually pronounce as the Germans do , if we are able , might well enough be unreservedly adopted , and written and spoken as good English , which indeed it is .

		As Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	sensibly remarks , in a cur - rent magazine article on pure English , `` if a word is now English , whatever its earlier origin , then it ought to be treated as English , deprived of its foreign accents , and forced to take an English plural . ' '

		He continues : `` No one doubts for a moment that cherub and criterion , medium and index can claim good standing in our English vocabulary , yet we find a pedant now and then who still bestows upon these helpless words the plurals they had to use in their native tongues , and who there - fore writes cherubim and criteria , media and indices , violating the grammatical purity of English . ''

		Many will have noted the pitfalls laid for the unwary and the uneducated in these foreign plurals : the use of data as a singular noun is now so common that presently we shall have the lexicographers bending to popular custom , and stamina already receives from them a sort of half - recognition as a singu - lar noun .

		The height of absurdity is attained in cherubims , which is not unknown in the speech of the uneducated .

		Another absurdity is met with in the lavish use of the French feminine adjective to designate brands of cigarettes , confectionery , and other merchan - dise .

		Thus we have `` Egyptienne cigarettes '' -LRB- not cigarettes egyptiennes -RRB- and `` Premiere chocolates . ''

		At some restaurants the guests are treated to `` spaghetti Italienne , '' as well as to `` bullion soup , '' `` consomme '' -LRB- unac - cented -RRB- , and other philologically wonderful dishes .

		Of course the French expression in full , of which the feminine adjective is often the surviving remnant , is familiar enough ; but that does not make good English or fault - less French of `` string beans Parisienne '' or ' ' lamb chops with Hollandaise sauce . ' '

		Those who are interested in the preservation of our tongue in its purity will enjoy reading the aforementioned article in the
March	DATE	issue of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		BOOKS FOR SPECIALISTS are among the most costly works known to the book trade .

		They may be out of print , rare , and all but unob - tainable ; or , if current publications , they may represent such an excess of labor and expense in their preparation , compared with the lim - ited demand they are likely to meet , as to ren - der their purchase an impossibility for most individual students and for all but the largest libraries .

		Hence the importance , to special - ists , of knowing just what great public collec - tions of books are strong in their particular fields .

		Among American libraries noted for their resources in these special departments , the
Newberry Library of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	enjoys a deserved repute .

		Its librarian 's latest Report has some pages of interesting reading that illustrate the zeal and intelligence constantly devoted to the strengthening of the various special collections in the library .

		That this effort is not wasted becomes evident from the testimony of the call slips .

		`` It is a note - worthy fact , ' ' records the librarian , ' ' that the most highly specialized divisions of the library are the ones whose books show a steadily increasing use .

		The casual visitor or person unfamiliar with the materials of research usually picks out just these divisions in which to ask the invariable question , ` But does any - one ever call for or need such books as these ? '

		And the necessarily affirmative reply evokes with equal invariability a politely skeptical smile . ''

		But the facts speak for themselves . ' '

		For example , the Prince
Louis Lucien Bona	PERSON	- parte Library consists of some 18,000 volumes , chiefly relating to the various languages , dia - lects , and patois known to have been spoken or employed as a medium of literary communica - tion in
Europe	LOCATION	during the past two thousand years .

		Few persons are able to make intelli -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 195 gent use of these works except trained philolo - gists and advanced students of literary and linguistic origins .

		And yet , well over 3,000 volumes were drawn from this collection for reading or consultation during
1914	DATE	, while during the five-year period , 1910-14 , nearly 15,000 volumes have been put at the service of readers .

		The case is the same with the
Edward E. Ayer Collection of Americana	ORGANIZATION	, an ex - tremely specialized library of original sources printed , manuscript , and graphic . ''

		It is a theory of librarians , which library expe - rience tends to confirm , that there is no book in any library that will not , sooner or later , find its reader .

		THE PERIODICITY OF ANECDOTES can hardly equal in regularity the recurrence of the
spring	DATE	and neap tides , or the successive re - turns of
Encke	ORGANIZATION	's Comet , but there is no ques - tion that the same popular story has a way of taking repeatedly new forms and enjoying fresh favor .

		It is not improbable that some neat situation , having tickled some one 's fancy either in real life or as an invention of the imagination , may again independently present itself in fact or fancy a half-century or so later ; just as the man in
Ohio	LOCATION	re-invented the screw-propeller a generation or more after it had been successfully applied to ship-propul - sion .

		Or the same good story may have simul - taneous birth in two distant places , after the manner of the
Adams	PERSON	and
Leverrier	PERSON	coinci - dence in astronomy .


Mark Twain	PERSON	's `` Jump - ing Frog '' is one of those unfailingly popular stories that might , without violence to proba - bility , have moved to laughter a knot of idlers on the banks of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	five thousand years ago , or a group of loungers on the strand at
Aulis	LOCATION	, at a somewhat later date .

		In fact , its occurrence , in Greek form , in the pages of Professor
Henry Sidgwick	PERSON	's `` Greek Prose Composition '' gave rise to the belief that the tale was of Athenian origin , and even its author was deceived until the translator ac - knowledged his deed .

		Familiar to observant readers is the frequent recurrence , with or without change of form , of the greater part of our best jokes and anecdotes .

		The humorous department of a justly-esteemed American magazine prints this month the supposed answer of a schoolboy to the question , What is the backbone ?

		The definition is hoary with age : ' ' The backbone is a long , straight bone .

		Your head sits on one end , and you sit on the other . ''

		Three months ago we retold -LRB- with due credit given -RRB- Miss
Effie L. Power	PERSON	's story , from `` How the Children of a Great Library Get Their Books , ' ' of the small boy who begged the librarian to extend the time on his book because he did not dare go home and get it for fear of being made to take a bath .

		Soon afterward one of our English exchanges repro - duced as new this
St. Louis	LOCATION	story with a Lon - don setting ; and so it promoted the gaiety of at least two nations within two months .

		A MAN OF INFINITE VARIETY , which age can - not wither nor custom stale , is he whose recent pamphlet , `` Commonsense about the War , '' shocked and alienated so many of his former admirers and set the world at large to dis - cussing with renewed curiosity this Protean and perplexing personality .

		Whether one considers him a genius or a mountebank , a seer or a charlatan , a philosopher or a mad - man , a constructive reformer or a ruthless iconoclast , Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	remains a perennially interesting , even fascinating , member of the human race .

		To him who in the love of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	holds communion with his visible forms he speaks a various language ; for his gayer hours he certainly has a voice of gladness and a smile , though he may not ex - actly glide into his darker musings with a mild and healing sympathy .

		Proof of something like universality in his genius is found in the rather amusing assurance with which one after another of those that have studied him venture to affirm that they alone really understand him and can interpret him to the world .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has expounded the real
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	an exposition in which the subject utterly failed to recognize himself , and Mr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	has laboriously pre - sented another real Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	; and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	himself has all the while , naturally enough , maintained that he himself was his only trust - worthy interpreter , and that the innumerable current opinions and impressions of him were all , or mostly , wrong ; and , finally , we have another self-confident expositor , Mr.
John Palmer	PERSON	, demolishing -LRB- in the pages of the cur - rent `` Century '' -RRB- all the hitherto accepted notions of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's character and explain - ing him anew to a mistaken world .

		Reduced to the conciseness of an algebraic formula , here is the latest solution of the `` G. B. S. '' puzzle : ' ' The ideas of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	== the commonplaces of his time .

		The ideas of Ber - nard
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	- f - his way of presenting them = G. B. S. '' SUGAR-COATING THE PILL OF REJECTION will never greatly lessen its bitterness , and many there are who prefer to take their pill , if take it they must , undisguised by this thin layer of saccharine deception .

		A certain editor of our acquaintance used to publish a soothingly plausible statement that there were no rejec - 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	tions in his office , but that after such literary offerings as best met existing needs had been selected the rest were restored with appro - priate thanks to their obliging senders .

		In somewhat the same spirit the head of the Bos - ton Public Library smilingly explains , if the reporter has not misinterpreted him , that `` in the purchase of fiction no books are ' censored , ' as that term is generally understood .

		We choose books , and that implies that some will be bought and others not bought .

		No doubt many books are not taken which are as good as , even better than , some that are taken .

		But , in choosing , various elements must be considered besides literary merit ; for example , adap - tability to uncultivated readers , human inter - est , unquestioned moral tone , and the fitness of the book for circulation , practically without formality , upon open shelves , free to readers of all ages . ''

		As to the somewhat celebrated volunteer board of fiction-tasters that so faith - fully serves the library , Mr. `` Wadlin adds : `` The volunteer committee which reads new fiction simply gives its opinion of the books , the way in which each strikes a reader of aver - age attainments ; it is not intended to give a literary judgment only , though that point is not overlooked , and what a reader says about a book is never conclusive as to its purchase . ' '

		Some books , though approved by this com - mittee , are not bought , and others , though not approved , are bought .

		`` That a book is not bought simply means that in the exercise of choice some other book was thought preferable , all things considered . ''

		After this the free advertisement given to a novel by its rejection on the part of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	ought to lose some of its commercial value .

		ENCOURAGING TO BOOK-DEALERS of the pres - ent are certain episodes in the book-trade of the past .

		Mr.
James Milne	PERSON	writes , in the course of a recent ``
London	LOCATION	Letter '' to `` The Book Monthly '' : `` We have to recognise , in the first place , that it is going to be a long war , possibly a very long war .

		It can not , in the nature of things , be as long as the
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic wars of a century ago ; but as a cata - clysm it may be compared to these , and perhaps we may derive some encouraging les - sons from them .

		If you remember , '
Waverley	LOCATION	, ' the first herald of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's genius , was published in the year before
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		His other stories began almost immediately to pour out ; and generally , while
Pitt	PERSON	was fight - ing
Napoleon	PERSON	, English literature was not merely not quiescent , but remarkably produc - tive .

		If this was possible then , why should it be different now when the field of authorship , if it be not so great in masters , is very much larger in area ?

		If ` eighteen hundred and war-time ' was more than a passably good period for English authorship , is there any reason why ` nineteen hundred and war - time ' should not also see good work and plenty of it in English literature ? ''

		Yet it should be borne in mind that warfare a century ago was not the tremendous and exhausting perform - ance that it is now .

		Also , as the writer admits , we have not , or are not conscious of having , any
Walter Scott	PERSON	at present producing Waver - leys for the entertainment and delight of the reading public .

		A FORGOTTEN CARLYLE MANUSCRIPT , never published , and , except to a few bibliophiles , not known to be in existence , has come to light among the literary treasures of a collector at
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and at the present writing is about to pass to the highest bidder at the
Henkels	LOCATION	auction rooms in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It is entitled ' ' The Guises , ' ' and is said to be forty - six folio pages in length , closely written in the familiar crabbed penmanship of its author , and to contain about twenty thousand words .

		Its date is given as
1855	DATE	.

		As its title indi - cates , it gives the history of the house of Guise from the first duke of that name .

		As it has to do with a part of
Europe	LOCATION	where history is just now violently in the making , let us quote a characteristic fragment from the opening page .

		``
Lorraine	PERSON	,
Lotharingen	LOCATION	, fell , not to the first
Lothar	PERSON	, who was
Charlemagne	PERSON	's grand - son , but to a 2d
Lothar	PERSON	-LRB- who married that one 's daughter -RRB- , but whose pedigree , relation - ships to men and things , and general bio - graphic physiognomy in this world remains , as is usual with these poor people , irretriev - ably dark to me , weltering in endless im - broglios of Carlovingian ramifications and disjecta membra ; unknown now I do believe to all the living ; for how can you know it ?

		Riddle it out for yourself , with much dis - gusting conscientious labour , you straightway proceed to forget it again : thrice over that has been our experience . ''

		READING IN THE TRENCHES varies the deadly monotony of killing and being killed .

		In Ger - many the call for books to be distributed in the field and in military hospitals is said to be such as to have caused a remarkable de - velopment of the travelling-library system , if that is the right term to apply to the mech - anism whereby literature is supplied to the soldiers of the fatherland .

		The Royal Library at
Berlin	LOCATION	, acting as a receiving and distribut - ing centre in this good work , sends out four thousand volumes daily to the front and to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 197 hospitals .

		A
Berlin	LOCATION	publishing house , that of
Ulstein & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has subscribed a large sum for the crating and packing of these books , and two express companies carry the boxes without charge .

		A
Hamburg	LOCATION	agency reports the re - ceipt of two hundred and three hundred books a day for distribution , and many other coop - erating agencies are similarly active .

		Both individual donors and publishing houses are contributing the reading matter that through these various channels flows to quench the book-thirst of the soldiers .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		WAB AND POETEY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The interesting article under the above caption in your issue of
March 4	DATE	has suggested this ques - tion in my mind : Is it not the violently partisan spirit pervading most of the verse of the present war which is chiefly responsible for its failure to measure up to high poetical standards ?

		The good poet is not necessarily a good patriot , love of humanity is with him a far more vital and com - pelling impulse than love of country ; and he sees too deeply and widely into the great complex of life ever to believe that in war , as in any other form of conflicting human relations , it is always a clear case of the devils against the angels .

		There is infinite poetical material in this European drama ; but it lies leagues beneath the surface aspects dealt with by the `` patriotic '' bards , with their hack - neyed variations on the chords of vituperation and self-righteousness .

		It lies in the tragedy of the individual soul , whether English , French , Ger - man , Russian , or what not ; it is to be found in the experiences of almost countless men and women who have made every sacrifice and suffered every agony of which humanity is capable and for a cause of which not one in ten thousand could give a coherent or plausible explanation .

		To me the most striking poem yet evoked by the war is Mr.
W. N. Ewer	PERSON	's '' Five Souls , '' pub - lished in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation ''
last autumn	DATE	.

		As it has never been reprinted in this country , so far as I know , perhaps you may be willing to let me share it with your readers . ''

		FIRST SOUL . ''

		I was a peasant of the Polish plain ; I left my plough because the message ran :
Russia	LOCATION	, in danger , needed every man To save her from the
Teuton	LOCATION	; and was slain .

		7 gave my life for freedom This I know : For those who bade me fight had told me so .

		SECOND SOUL . ''

		I was a Tyrolese , a mountaineer ; I gladly left my mountain home to fight Against the brutal , treacherous Muscovite ; And died in
Poland	LOCATION	on a Cossack spear .

		I gave my life for freedom This I know : For those who bade me fight had told me so .

		THIRD SOUL .

		I worked in
Lyons	LOCATION	at my weaver 's loom , When suddenly the Prussian despot hurled His felon blow at
France	LOCATION	and at the world ; Then I went forth to
Belgium	LOCATION	and my doom .

		I gave my life for freedom This I know : For those who bade me fight had told me so .

		FOURTH SOUL .

		I owned a vineyard by the wooded Main , Until the Fatherland , begirt by foes Lusting her downfall , called me , and I rose Swift to the call and died in fair
Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		/ gave my life for freedom This I know : For those who bade me fight had told me so .

		FIFTH SOUL . ''

		I worked in a great shipyard by the
Clyde	PERSON	.

		There came a sudden word of wars declared , Of
Belgium	LOCATION	, peaceful , helpless , unprepared , Asking our aid : I joined the ranks , and died .

		I gave my life for freedom This I know : For those who bade me fight had told me so . ''

		This may not be great poetry in form , but is not its truth and power as '' a criticism of life '' beyond question ?

		The essential folly and tragedy of war , the blind devotion to leaders , the beauty of self - sacrifice , all this and much more glows through these simple lines , and makes the poem worth -LRB- to me , at least -RRB- a ton of the '' mad Kaiser '' and '' per - fidious Albion '' sort of thing with which we have for months been deluged .

		A TEXTUAL DIFFICULTY IN
MILTON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If I may be permitted to offer my conjecture on the textual difficulty in the tenth book of Milton 's '' Paradise Lost , '' suggested by the communication in your issue of
March 4	DATE	, I should like to venture the following .

		The whole situation , briefly stated , seems to be this : Sin and Death had just completed the giant causeway , and '' now descried their way to earth , first tending to Paradise '' -LRB- 1 .

		325 -RRB- , when the meet - ing with Satan , which is under consideration , took place .

		Now the question arises , Where shall we locate these three spirits of evil ?

		It appears to me that this may be done quite satisfactorily by first gathering together the most important visualizing data of this structure , and of the flight of Satan returning to his palace in Hell .

		That great '' pontifice '' was evidently '' high arched '' -LRB- 1 .

		301 -RRB- , to begin with , a fact we must not lose sight of , if we wish to follow
Milton	PERSON	's description of this path through Chaos .

		A little further on we learn that Satan , while '' steering his zenith betwixt Centaur and the Scorpion '' -LRB- 1 .

		328 -RRB- , or somewhere near what we might per - haps coldly term the limits of our solar system , `` met who to meet him came '' -LRB- 1 .

		349 -RRB- , namely , the aforesaid Sin and Death .

		Here , I think , we should bear in mind that he is returning , not has returned , to Hell , as your correspondent apparently conceived him to have done ; he was on his way , 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	but not yet arrived there .

		All the text gives us is , that after Eve was '' seduced , '' '' to Hell he now returned '' -LRB- 11 .

		332-346 -RRB- ; `` returned '' being here , according to the general context , a simple narrative imperative , not a participle , as our original inquiry seems to suggest in the expression : '' At the mo - ment of meeting Satan is represented as l now returned to
Hell / 1	ORGANIZATION	.

		346 . ''

		This contention being taken for granted , we may claim that Satan only came upon the first incline of the unsuspected highway , when he met his fellow-spirits .

		He was only '' steering his zenith , '' after having risen from
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, and reached the bounds of our atmospheric sea , wing - ing his way as an angle of light -LRB- 1 .

		327 -RRB- , and apparently unconscious of '' a passage broad , smooth , easy , inoffensive '' -LRB- 1 .

		305 -RRB- , and obligingly prepared by his children .

		Espying the latter , he no doubt descended or `` lighted from his wing , '' '' and at sight of that stupendous bridge his joy increased , '' and he stood long admiring -LRB- 1 .

		350 -RRB- .

		And the part of the bridge where he would be most likely to stop and praise , as he soon did , would be right here , rather than at the door of Hell , or at the end of his flight .

		Approximating , then , the view from this ethereal spot , or trying to do so , we ought not to do vio - lence to the imagination in undertaking to fix it too rigidly , and with too strict a localism .

		Neverthe - less , for a scientific age there is perhaps nothing so agreeable here as at least a half-way probable mathematical precision in the location of this meeting-point .

		This could be done by thinking of this whole magnitude of space as a great cosmic spherical triangle , with Hell and Paradise at the lower apexes and the point in question at the top ; and the '' stupendous bridge , '' or '' the three several ways in sight , to each of these three places '' -LRB- 1 .

		323 -RRB- , as the bi-sectors of the three angles of this imaginary triangle .

		Then the bi-sector of the Para - dise-angle would curve downward to
Earth	LOCATION	, the bi-sector of the Hell-angle would curve down to Hell-gates , and the bi-sector of the upper angle would incline `` near to Heaven 's door '' -LRB- 1 .

		389 -RRB- .

		Thus the intersection of all three bi-sectors would be the point of meeting in our discussion .

		But inasmuch as Satan was only between '' Cen - taur and the Scorpion , '' not yet out of reach of our solar system , he was at the '' brink of Chaos '' -LRB- L 347 -RRB- , `` near the foot of this new wondrous ponti - fice . ''

		If then we consider that this monstrous structure was curved and '' high arched , '' and that the segment reaching to earth was probably shorter than the one running down to Hell -LRB- 11 .

		320-323 -RRB- , Sin and Death could easily descend to Paradise and Satan likewise descend '' down to Hell . ''

		And yet , after all , the imaginative freedom of poetry almost revolts at such a matter-of-fact ex - planation !

		Suffice it to say that
Milton	PERSON	here neither '' nodded , '' nor gave an amanuensis cause to commit a blunder at once fatal to true poetry and vexatious to her conscientious student .

		The won - derful constructive imagination of the master mind simply took such a magnificent flight that ours of the lesser wing was at first unable to follow .

		SOME ANTI-GERMAN MISCONCEPTIONS CORRECTED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	's communication in your issue of
February 16	DATE	contains a few errors of fact which you may wish to correct .

		1 .

		The representatives of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	in the
Reichstag	LOCATION	are elected by universal suffrage ; and this suffrage is conceded to be as free and un - hampered as any in the world .

		Alsace-Lorraine has fifteen representatives , and at the last elec - tion two of these represented the French party , while thirteen represented the various German parties .

		2 .

		With the exception of
Mecklenburg	LOCATION	, all Ger - man states have different constitutions than they had before
1848	DATE	.

		3 .

		The Constitution of the German Empire of
1871	DATE	is a liberal document , and should not be over - looked by those who wish to discuss German Con - stitutions .

		4 .

		Most Germans who emigrated to
America	LOCATION	did not do so because '' life was unendurable to them in the Fatherland , '' but because they believed that
America	LOCATION	offered opportunities which none of the European countries could afford to encourage .

		To draw conclusions unfavorable to
Germany	LOCATION	from the presence of many millions of people of Ger - man stock in this country is erroneous unless one wishes to draw similar conclusions as to the other countries whose sons have settled here .

		The aver - age emigration from
England	LOCATION	for the past ten years has been over 200,000 , while the emigration from
Germany	LOCATION	has practically ceased .

		5 .

		Nobody who knows modern
Germany	LOCATION	can be - lieve that the Bourbon maxim , '' Everything for the people , nothing by the people , '' is effective in
Germany	LOCATION	to-day .

		One glance at the German con - stitution , as well as familiarity with the workings of the
Reichstag	LOCATION	, will disprove this assertion with - out question .

		6 .

		England has more '' frightful slaughters on her mind '' than any other nation , perhaps because the extension and maintenance of her world empire amid less civilized people has made greater de - mands on her .

		The suppression of the Indian mutinies , the Egyptian River War described by Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	, the Boer War with its concentra - tion camps and Lord
Roberts	PERSON	's proclamation issued from
Pretoria	LOCATION	, and finally the oppression of Ire - land , prove this .

		7 .

		During the Civil War almost 200,000 Ameri - cans of German descent fought for the Union ; while '' the Germans in this country , '' as Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore
Roosevelt	PERSON	says , '' were largely responsible for keeping
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and
Missouri	LOCATION	in the
Union	LOCATION	. ''

		Nobody thought any the less of these people at that time ; nor did any one doubt their loyalty because they were proud of their German descent .

		It is very unfortunate if the natural difference of opinion prevalent as to the right or wrong in the European War induces the Anglo-Saxon ma - jority or the
Teuton	LOCATION	minority to doubt each other 's loyalty to their joint country .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 199 00ks .

		THE NEW MOVEMENT IN DRAMATIC PRESENTATION .

		* A `` new movement '' in art or in anything else generally goes through three stages .

		First , an idea is conceived by some genius , or by a few people of genius sometimes working together , sometimes separately , and is appre - ciated by a few people who are apt nowadays to be scattered about all over the world .

		Next , it begins to come to public notice and is found so interesting that people write , first articles then books about it or the people concerned with it .

		Every one begins to know something about it or the people concerned with it , and it has for a time a popularity which is often enough factitious and short-lived .

		Later * everybody knows about it , takes it as a matter of course , and then its true power begins to tell widely , if there be enough in it , because the people at large are familiar enough with it to be able to get at its true spirit .

		This has happened with all sort of things , and not in matters of art alone .

		The `` new movement '' in the theatre is still , in
America	LOCATION	at least , in the second stage .

		For ten or twenty years there have been innova - tions in stage presentation , Greek plays , Shakespearean settings , out-of-door plays , `` Yellow Jackets , '' and the like .

		And for as many years there have been people here and there who understood and appreciated them , sometimes many , sometimes few .

		Now , how - ever , after a good many articles , criticisms , magazines , and what not , there are appearing books which offer a general account of the matter .

		`` We are beginning to wake up to the idea that here is something important .

		Just how important , people might not agree .

		Mr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	, in his chapter on newer tendencies in `` The Changing Drama , '' calls it ' ' this art of the future which stands out as the most significant tendency of the contem - porary drama . ''

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is -LRB- among other things -RRB- one of the most widely read dramatic critics of our day ; few know as well as he what is `` up '' in the dramatic world , what are the currents of present-day thought , what people are thinking , dreaming , doing , or trying to do .

		He views as most significant this effort to give form and body to the play .

		Most significant or not , good or bad , here is a lear enough case ; everybody knows some - thing about it .

		We have now two books , each * THE THEATRE OF TODAY .

		THE THEATRE OF
MAX REINHARDT	PERSON	.

		By
Huntly Carter	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		of which gives something of a broad treatment of the subject ; one the general account of the conditions of the theatre by Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	, the other Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	's book on
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	.

		This latter book makes the well - known producer of the Deutsches Theater the basis of a general treatment .

		Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	gives a more generally planned account of the matter , but is more especially interested in the work of Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		As is commonly known , these two men have for some years been the leading innovators in the new Art of the Theatre .

		If I had to choose between the two I should choose Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	's book , and that not because I agree with him in his admiration for Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, although I do , but because he gives a well-ordered and well-worked-out gen - eral treatment of the whole subject .

		He would appear to have a more systematic mind than Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	, who , when he gave a while ago an aper ^ u of the whole field , got his material together in a form which must have stood in the way of many who would have liked to know something about the subject he was presenting .

		Nor does Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	seem to me less appreciative and under - standing because he is more systematic .

		He has by no means the arid idea of the pure stu - dent and investigator .

		In fact , his mind appears to act in much the same way as other men 's , which is a great advantage when one tries to explain matters to one 's fellows .

		The reader will find in his book general ideas and principles , as well as particular details and events ; he can get the general view and also learn facts , dates , and so on .

		Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	views the New Theatre through the medium , as we may say , of
Max Eeinhardt	PERSON	, the director of the
Deutsches Theater	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a good thing that he has done so , for there is no other thorough treatment of
Reinhardt	ORGANIZATION	's work in English .

		He does not , however , give a definite biography ; in fact the title of his book shows that it is the dramatic or theatrical art that is of interest to him rather than the personal development .

		And in this matter Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	is known to have much information and knowledge .


Max Reinhardt	PERSON	is the man who has actually done most in the new art of dramatic presentation .

		For ten or twelve years now he has given plays in
Berlin	LOCATION	, plays of all kinds : `` Salome '' by
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, `` The Lower Depths '' by
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	, `` Pelleas and Melisande '' by
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, `` Electra '' by
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	, `` Candida '' by
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, `` Rosmersholm '' by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the staid old plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has naturally put on the stage the plays of others , many of whom had no idea at 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	all of the kind of stage upon which their works were destined eventually to appear : Sophocles and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote their plays for theatres very different from anything
Reinhardt	PERSON	was likely to use .

		So in a lesser degree with
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same thing was doubtless the case with many writers of our own day ; Gorky and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	probably took little account of the possibilities of the modern stage , whatever we may think of
Hofmannsthal	ORGANIZATION	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Reinhardt seems to stand for an idea that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	gives us : `` In the light of
Croce	PERSON	's theories , I should like to stress the fact that in the presentation of a drama we have the most intricate and com - plex form of critical reproduction . ''

		Rein - hardt is , as one may say , a critic , interpreting the works of the great dramatists of any and all time , just as .


Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	interpreted `` Hamlet , '' putting them so that people in general will really get at them .

		There is , however , another way of doing things in this dramatic movement , namely , that which is generally associated with the name of Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		Similar as his work is in many ways to that of
Reinhardt	PERSON	, yet if we may judge from his writings it has a different spirit and motive power .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	has been engaged in presenting the work of others : he has not been able to present many plays ; he has no such imposing record of interpretations as
Reinhardt	PERSON	; but the few things he has done have made an immense impression , his `` Hamlet '' and `` The Blue Bird ' ' at
Moscow	LOCATION	, especially .

		To us in Amer - ica that matters less because we know these things chiefly by book , and Mr.
Craig	PERSON	is most widely known by his writings .

		If we call
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	critical , we may say that
Gordon Craig	PERSON	is creative .

		He thinks of something other than simple presentation or interpreta - tion ; in his `` Art of the Theatre '' a few years ago he presented the idea of a creative artist using all the means of the drama and the thea - tre to embody his thought .

		THE DIAL has already printed some studies of his ideas apropos of his books .

		I have mentioned Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	's book as presenting the ideas of Mr.
Craig	PERSON	.

		This gives only a slight idea of the book , which is an ex - cellent treatment of the whole matter of the theatrical art of to-day .

		The mechanical forces are described , the different innovations in the form of the stage , the revolving stage , the rolling stage , the sliding stage ; the arrange - ments for scenery , like the cyclorama or the horizont ; the different developments in light - ing .

		The matter is also considered more or less at length from the artistic standpoint , and also with reference to what is being done in this country .

		Design , color , light , three matters so fundamental in the newer ideas , are dealt with .

		The literary forces are con - sidered , namely , the dramatists now at work throughout the world .

		The book ends with a consideration of the social and economic forces ; and in fact we have a very general , all-around treatment of the subject , not at all limited to any particular view or school .

		I do not , in fact , know of any other one book which gives a better introduction to the dramatic world to-day , unless it be that of Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son 's already quoted , which takes the subject rather from the dramatic standpoint , the point of view of literature , as Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	views it from the theatrical standpoint , that of the stage .

		Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	's book is a good accompani - ment to those of Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	in giving an idea of the theatre , not so much as the means of interpreting the work of great dramatists , as a means whereby the artist may express himself .

		That is the new ' ' Art of the Theatre '' ; just as an artist may express him - self in painting , music , poetry , architecture , or in many other well-recognized ways , so he may express himself by the much more com - plex means of the theatre , which calls for the use of poetry , painting , music , architecture , as well as acting , dancing , pantomime , costume , and so on .

		`` The drama as the culminating synthesis of all the arts '' is Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's expression .

		The artist of the theatre is a creator rather than a critic .

		This is rather an art of the future : even Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	, who is very busy fashioning his instrument , has not yet played upon it , at least so far as the world in general is concerned .

		Although Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	seems some - thing of a partisan , I see no reason why one should think of any necessary antagonism be - tween the critical and the creative schools of presentation .

		Even though the creative view appeal to one most , as it does to me , there is no getting away from the other .

		Create as much as possible , there must always be the critical presentation , unless we are content to let all the great drama of the past sink into nothingness .

		There will always be the pre - sentation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , unless Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	should succeed in his ill-concealed effort to make away with him in the public mind .

		It will never be possible to present Shakespeare in the way he was originally pre - sented , we can never produce just the im - pressions that he produced in the way he did ; if we could reconstitute the Elizabethan actor and the Elizabethan play-house we could never reconstitute the Elizabethan audience .

		So there must always be the modern presentation
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 201 of Shakespeare and of the other great masters of the drama , and that , as a rule , by means of which they did not dream .

		Even the dram - atists of our day , unless devoted `` men of the theatre , ' ' must often be in ignorance of the means whereby their imaginations will be real - ized ; indeed , they must often see their own imaginations realized in ways better and more adequate than they had conceived themselves .

		The critical presentation will even be the most common .

		It is presumably easier , for one thing ; in the drama , as elsewhere , one will find many men of critical ability for one of any creative power .

		It is also more widely useful ; in learning the Art of the Theatre , as in learn - ing any other art , whether for creative pur - pose or merely for general culture , one must deal with the work of earlier masters .

		Great geniuses have developed without the training of schools and conservatories , and on the other hand the confining effect of traditional criti - cism has been long understood .

		Yet in the main , genius likes to view the work of genius .

		One can not learn the Art of the Theatre out of one 's head , nor are there many schools like Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's at
Florence	LOCATION	; the young artists of the theatre must learn their art by seeing plays produced , and it will certainly be hard on them -LRB- as on the public -RRB- to see only the plays of their own time and generation and even moment , as might be the case if the creative artist of the theatre dominated the situation .

		There must always be critics of the theatre , like
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	, who has never sought himself to create , save perhaps in a minor way .

		Yet the ideas of Mr.
Craig	PERSON	are singularly sug - gestive .

		The practical man will doubtless think it improbable that we shall ever have many dramatic artists who can both conceive a dramatic idea and themselves bring it to presentation , even with the assistance of prop - erly subservient specialists in acting , lighting , music , and so on .

		It is probable that we shall never have very many , but certainly we shall have none at all unless a beginning is somehow made .

		And making once a good beginning we may find it not so impossible to continue as it may have once appeared .

		To me , if I may add a sort of obiter dictum , such matters appear most likely to be fruitful in a direction not often noticed , namely , in developing a dramatic audience .

		I know of nothing that makes one understand a play bet - ter than to try to present it .

		If you want to understand `` Hamlet , '' get a company of your friends to act `` Hamlet , '' even though you can get nobody to come and see you .

		The study you will have to give the play will give you an appreciation you never have had be - fore , especially if you can yourself assume the task of directing the performance .

		But more useful even than the presenting the works of others is the presenting plays of one 's own upon no matter how small a scale provided it be done with any real consideration of the needs and necessities of the case .

		You may give your performance at one end of a parlor , on a High School stage , at a Club smoker , or in a garden , or anywhere else .

		Provided you realize your dramatic opportunities and use them in an artistic way , you are getting some - thing on the Art of the Theatre that you can - not get even by going to see other people act every night in the season and reading plays in books all the rest of the year .

		Only one must do the thing in the best way with the view of the artist of the theatre , not necessarily of Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	or any particular person .

		And a public made up of people who were accustomed to such matters , who took stage presentation as naturally as they did reading , would be one which would appreciate the work of the masters better than ours does now .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		Two YEARS IN HURRICANE LAND .

		* After the thrill and exultation attending the conquest of , first , the
North Pole	LOCATION	and then , within a brief space , the
South Pole	LOCATION	, it might seem that further exploration of Arctic or Antarctic regions must partake of the nature of an anticlimax ; and in some sense this can - not but be true .

		No other pushing into the unknown can quite equal in excitement the pursuit of that infinitesimal point where all the meridians meet and there is no longer any East or any West .

		But just as the discovery of
America	LOCATION	did not exhaust the possibilities of occidental exploration and adventure , so the achievements of Captains
Peary	PERSON	and Amund - sen have rather stimulated than deadened eagerness to learn more of the secrets of the frozen polar seas and undefined continents .

		Among those best equipped by nature and training to supplement the work of those earlier explorers , Sir
Douglas Mawson	PERSON	, of Ade - laide
University	ORGANIZATION	and a member of the Shackle - ton expedition of 1907-9 , .

		is not the least conspicuous .

		His organization and leadership of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911-14 placed him among the foremost of skilled and resourceful and intrepid adven - turers into the vast unknown of
Antarctica	LOCATION	, `` the home of the blizzard , '' as he calls it in the title to his elaborate work descriptive of that expedition , now published in two hand - * THE HOME OP THE BLIZZARD .

		Being the Story of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition , 1911-1914 .

Douglas Mawson	PERSON	, D.Sc. ,
B.E.	LOCATION	Illustrated in color and black and white , also with maps .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		202 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	some volumes , with every accompaniment of colored and uncolored illustration , of map and diagram and appendix , that the exigent reader could desire except that the more scientific or technical fruits of the undertaking are reserved for future presentation .

		As explained in the opening chapter , the design of the expedition was to land a party of five men on
Macquarie Island	LOCATION	, about half - way between
Australia	LOCATION	and the Antarctic con - tinent , this party to be equipped with wireless apparatus for communication with the ex - plorers southward and with
Hobart	LOCATION	to the north , and to carry on certain assigned investi - gations , while the rest of the company took in hand the more arduous and hazardous ex - ploration of the little-known regions lying within or near the Antarctic Circle between
King George V Land	ORGANIZATION	on the east and
Queen Mary Land	ORGANIZATION	on the west , or over a stretch of nearly sixty degrees of longitude .

		This latter work was to be done by several parties oper - ating separately but in pursuance of one well - considered scheme , which embraced researches in geography , oceanography , meteorology , glaciology , geology , biology , bacteriology , the study of tides , wireless and auroral observa - tions , and terrestrial magnetism .

		In addition to the chief 's account of the expedition as a whole , and of his own activities as organizer and leader , as first in command at the `` main base '' in
Adelie	LOCATION	Land , and as engaged in a particularly toilsome and dangerous excur - sion to the eastward across King
George	PERSON	V Land , the book contains subordinate and al - most equally interesting narratives from the pens of those who led forth other parties on their several more or less perilous quests .

		Even those who have had but slight expe - rience in roughing it with an outing party will appreciate what the author has to say on the extreme importance of care in selecting the men with whom one is to winter and
summer	DATE	in the wilderness .

		Mental and physical equip - ment for the work in prospect is not enough , though it is indispensable ; moral quality must also be insisted upon . ''

		In no department can a leader spend time more profitably than in the selection of the men who are to accomplish the work .

		Even when the expedition has a scientific basis , academic distinction becomes secondary to the choice of men .


Fiala	PERSON	, as a result of his Arctic experience , truly says , ' Many a man who is a jolly good fellow in congenial surround - ings will become impatient , selfish and mean when obliged to sacrifice his comfort , curb his desires and work hard in what seems a losing fight .

		The first consideration in the choice of men for a polar campaign should be the moral quality .

		Next should come mental and physical powers . ' ''

		Of interest , too , is this further specification of attributes essential to success in the peculiar task here under consideration : '' For polar work the great desideratum is tem - pered youth .

		Although one man at the age of fifty may be as strong physically as another at the age of twenty , it is certain that the exceptional man of fifty was also an exceptional man at twenty .

		On the average , after about thirty years of age , the elasticity of the body to rise to the strain of emergency diminishes , and , when forty years is reached , a man , medically speaking , reaches his acme .

		After that , degeneration of the fabric of the body slowly and maybe imperceptibly sets in .

		As the difficulties of exploration in cold regions ap - proximate to the limit of human endurance and often enough exceed it , it is obvious that the above generalizations must receive due weight . ''

		The men selected with proper regard to this Oslerian age limit comprised a party of about forty , including the five ship 's officers and several temporary members of the expedition , and all but one seem to have fulfilled expecta - tion in respect to physical hardihood .

		That one , Dr.
Xavier Mertz	PERSON	, a Swiss of exceptional ability and promise , and not yet thirty years of age , succumbed to exposure and an insuffi - ciency of nutrition on the arduous expedition already mentioned which was led by
Dr. Maw	ORGANIZATION	- son .

		The other member of this party ,
Lieuten	PERSON	- ant
B. E. S. Ninnis	PERSON	, a youth of twenty - three , also lost his life on the way , falling with sledge and dogs through a crust of snow covering a crevasse .

		These two , it appears , were the only ones who failed to survive the rigors and perils of the enterprise .

		Most tragic and grimly impressive is the story of that ill-fated excursion from which only the leader , after indescribable sufferings and hair-breadth escapes , returned to the friendly shelter of winter quarters .

		That a month of lonely struggle and semi-starvation -LRB- the last dog had been sacrificed -RRB- in those icy solitudes should have left him with reason unimpaired and bodily powers not perma - nently weakened , is almost beyond belief , and speaks volumes for his virility .

		The tempta - tion to let go his grip , in more senses than one , evidently assailed him with increasing fre - quency as the margin of possible endurance became narrower .

		A passage from his diary illustrates that strange mingling of the awful and the trivial , the sublime and the ridiculous , that many a reader will have noted in his own experience at moments of exceptional trial or danger . ''

		Going up a long , fairly steep slope , deeply covered with soft snow , broke through lid of crevasse but caught myself at thighs , got out , turned fifty yards to the north , then attempted to cross trend of crevasse , there being no indication of it ; a few moments later found myself dangling fourteen feet below on end of rope in crevasse
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 203 sledge creeping to mouth had time to say to myself , ' so this is the end , ' expecting the sledge every moment to crash on my head and all go to the unseen bottom then thought of the food uneaten on the sledge ; but as the sledge pulled up without letting me down , thought of
Providence	LOCATION	giving me another chance . ''

		It was a small chance , but the edge of the crevasse was at last gained , when a second fall , to the full length of the rope , followed .

		The remainder of the incident must be told in the author 's own words : '' Exhausted , weak and chilled -LRB- for my hands were bare and pounds of snow had got inside my clothing -RRB- I hung with the firm conviction that all was over except the passing .

		Below was a black chasm ; it would be but the work of a moment to slip from the harness , then all the pain and toil would be over .

		It was a rare situation , a rare temptation a chance to quit small things for great to pass from the petty exploration of a planet to the contemplation of vaster worlds be - yond .

		But there was all eternity for the last and , at its longest , the present would be but short .

		I felt better for the thought .

		My strength was fast ebbing ; in a few minutes it would be too late .

		It was the occasion for a supreme effort .

		New powers seemed to come as I addressed myself to one last tremendous effort .

		The struggle occupied some time , but by a miracle I rose slowly to the surface .

		This time I emerged feet first , still holding on to the rope , and pushed myself out , extended at full length , on the snow on solid ground .

		Then came the reaction , and I could do nothing for quite an hour / ' Though the author modestly ascribes to a friendly reviser any literary merit his chap - ters may possess , it is plain that the pre - requisite of having something to say before attempting to say it , is all his own , and that he can well afford to let his style take care of itself .

		Not unworthy of a place beside the last recorded words of the ill-fated Captain
Scott	PERSON	is the terse account of that all but desperate struggle to regain the land of the living after death had claimed the two companions of the outward journey .

		Other parts that hold the attention are the detailed descriptions of land - ing , hut-building , dog-management , and all the ingenuities and contrivances evolved by the exigencies of the time and place .

		Recogni - tion also is due to the clear style , effective and unwasteful of words , in which the lesser con - tributors to the book tell their respective tales of more or less exciting adventure .

		A later work presenting the scientific results of these two years -LRB- and somewhat more -RRB- of manifold investigation in an almost virgin field is prom - ised .

		Here , then , let it suffice to register appreciation of the more generally narrative and descriptive volumes .

		Their appearance and workmanship , with the large , clear type of the
Ballantyne Press	ORGANIZATION	, and with their many strikingly beautiful illustrations , including a number of unusually fine colored ones , and their generous provision of large folding maps , could not easily have been improved upon .

		In only one particular , hardly important enough to mention , has expectation been a little dis - appointed : the index references seem to lack that scrupulous accuracy which the reviewer if not the general reader likes to find in a work of so rich and varied contents as `` The Home of the Blizzard . ' '


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE QUALITY ' OF GENIUS .

		* The first edition of
Tiirck	ORGANIZATION	's `` Man of Genius '' was published in
Germany	LOCATION	in
1896	DATE	, and was so well received that other editions , variously revised and enlarged , rapidly fol - lowed one another .

		In all , seven editions have been issued in
Germany	LOCATION	up to the present time .

		The English translation , now before us , was prepared and printed in
Germany	LOCATION	, though published in
London	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	's conception of genius is a quali - tative rather than a quantitative one .

		We are not to regard as a genius any man possessing extraordinary abilities , without reference to their nature .

		On the other hand , something of the quality of genius is universal : as
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer said , ' ' really every child is to a certain extent a genius . ''

		We are to consider that genius is an inherent power , without reference to performance ; thus it is easy to imagine a man potentially capable of producing works of genius , hindered by circumstances from doing anything of consequence .

		What , then , is the essential mark of genius ?

		It is , according to Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	-LRB- following
Schopenhauer	PERSON	-RRB- , a capac - ity for love , using that word in the widest sense , an objective tendency , which seeks realization through contact with the external world , and puts aside selfish and subjective mo - tives .

		At the same time , appreciation or love being the motive force , reality is idealized , and the world is understood in its meaning , rather than in its imperfect expression .

		This , we must hold , is to get at the core of truth , the original version of which visible things are , as it were , an imperfect translation .

		Thus we glide into idealism , our own nature suffusing and transforming external reality .

		It may properly be objected , that Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	has selected the human quality which he most admires and values , and has labelled it genius .

		At the same time , he is not altogether without warrant in this , for according to the ordi - nary conception of the word , genius certainly * THE MAN OP GENIUS .

		York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Hermann THJrck	PERSON	.

		Ph.D. .

		New 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	implies increased capacity for understanding and appreciation .

		Think of any man to whom we ascribe this quality , is he not distin - guished by the breadth and depth of his relationship to reality , by the extent of his com - prehension of truth ?

		He can not be wholly self - centred , if only for the reason that his field would remain altogether too narrow for the expression of his powers .

		So , as we think about it , the simple definition which our author gives , `` genius is love , '' rather grows upon us , and seems less absurd than when we first read it .

		Then , as to the idealistic outcome : is it a final reaction from the severity of truth , a re - turn to the subjectivism from which we sup - posed we had escaped ?

		Perhaps so , in part , but it is curious to recall a rather similar development in the innermost sanctum of the most modern science .

		Following the path first indicated by
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	, we have explored the maze of heredity in directions he never knew , and find ourselves contemplating every living being as a compromise between what is and what ' ' might have been . ' '

		Not at all as a mat - ter of idealism , but by calculations having almost the validity of mathematics , do we postulate the potential qualities of this or that descendant of known ancestors , and estimate the deviation from the fullest expression , due to this cause or that .

		Are we , then , to blame the philosophical idealist , who , looking beneath the surface of things , discerns often a half - expressed meaning , and values the outcome partly for the implied purpose ?

		Crass anthro - pomorphism , if you like , but we can not do without it .

		Repeat a thousand times , things are what they are , and even in science we can never forget that they are also , in a genuine sense for us , what they are not .

		It is rather more difficult to follow our author in some other matters .

		Growing out of the idea of the disinterestedness of genius , there is developed the conception that the ac - tivity must be its own justification , rather than any particular end to be gained .

		In any intense work , it is certainly true that the mind is centred upon the activity itself , and the end to be gained may be quite nebulous or unreal - ized for the time being .

		Under such circum - stances the work is pleasurable ; whereas if the end alone is in view , it becomes a burden .

		Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	goes so far as to assert that the high - est work , thus accomplished , is of the nature of play , and states in several passages that the genius is primarily interested in what he is doing , and can not take the world and its needs very seriously .

		He thus dismisses the future , as it were ; he has neither hope nor fear ; in a word he is free from care .

		Here we think the extremes meet , and we find that our genius is after all in danger of landing in that very mire of selfishness from which he had escaped .

		We are confirmed in this opinion when we find the author lauding
Napoleon	PERSON	as a man after his own heart .

		This breakdown of the whole theory , as it seems to us , is especially apparent in the ex - tremely interesting chapter on `` Hamlet . ''

		The play is analyzed quite fully from Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	's point of view ; and whatever we may think of this , the boldness and originality of the treatment command admiration .

		The idea is , that Hamlet was a genius in the fullest sense of the word , capable of great ideas , of seeing things in the large , incapable of nar - rowness and selfishness .

		He grew up believing in the general goodness of men and things , supposing that the love of his mother and the respect of all men for his father were due to the latter 's good qualities alone .

		When he finds that the same respect and love are given to one who has indeed power , but is in all other respects unworthy , the whole fabric of his idealism collapses .

		He finds , too , that
Ophelia	PERSON	has none of the high qualities which he sup - posed must go with so lovely a form .

		Conse - quently , although he is not wanting in courage and other manly qualities , he sees things in too large a way to care very much about mere revenge , about a deed which will not , can not , set the whole world right .

		It is not a matter of conscience , of moral uncertainty , but of lack of interest in a mere detail of the wretch - edness of things .

		Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	states that this explanation occurred to him one day when reflecting on the passage in the
Gospel of Matthew	ORGANIZATION	, in which Christ asks `` Who is my mother ?

		and who are my brethren ?

		And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my breth - ren ! ''

		It struck him that Hamlet , in like man - ner , had gone beyond the stage of feeling special responsibility in connection with his father as distinguished from other men .

		This ingenious hypothesis surely can not represent
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's meaning .

		As it seems to the reviewer , the greatness of the tragedy of `` Hamlet , '' as that of `` Othello , '' lies in the internal rather than the external failure , the wreck of an essentially noble nature which could not rise to the occasion .

		It is for this reason that we are more moved by these plays than by ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		To represent Ham - let 's attitude as laudable , and put the whole blame on the cheapness of his environment , is to emasculate the work .

		At the same time , no doubt , the quality which Dr.
Tiirck	PERSON	calls genius , the breadth of understanding and ap - preciation , may at times deprive men of that
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 205 simplicity of purpose which is necessary to action .

		Shakespeare appears to have under - stood at least this , that academic life and thought tended to inhibit action , and his lesson may not be without significance for us to-day .

		Other chapters take up
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faust , ''
Byron	PERSON	's `` Manfred , ''
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and Spi - noza , Christ and Buddha ,
Darwin	PERSON	and
Lorn	PERSON	- broso ,
Stirner	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The treatment of `` Faust '' is especially detailed and original , but we can not take the space to outline it here .

		Stirner ,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, together with
Lombroso	PERSON	, are vigorously at - tacked , and called antisophers .

		It is perhaps hardly fair to class Ibsen with the others , but his work is discussed at length , and the au - thor 's position is made clear .

		We may close with a quotation remarkable not only for its pungent sarcasm , but for a certain suggestive - ness in relation to the attitude taken by some learned men with reference to the happenings of to-day .

		After describing
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's theory of conduct , Dr.
Turck	PERSON	exclaims : '' Imagine , on these lines , a speech for the de - fence such as the following : ' Gentlemen of the jury , the accused pleads guilty to having com - mitted a murder : I request you , however , to con - sider how horribly beautiful his crime is .

		From a sheer passion for murder because , as our great Nietzsche sayc , '' his soul wanted blood ... he thirsted for the happiness of the knife , '' he de - coyed a child to a lonely place , and slowly killed it with exquisite tortures .

		Neither the innocently terrified looks of the child , the little hands con - vulsively clasped in despair , the small body trem - bling and twitching with pain , nor the pitifully beseeching voice and the frightful cries of the little creature writhing in an agonizing death could touch this man 's heart .

		What sternness of decision and character he here showed .

		To whom would it come easy to imitate him ?

		Who would not rather commit suicide than inflict such terrible suffering on a poor little creature ?

		Gentlemen of the jury , I pray you to admire this man 's strength of mind , '' the beautiful terribleness of the deed , '' as our famous antisopher calls it , and further beg you to consider what this man would have been able to accomplish , had he been born to a throne . ' ''

		ENGLISH LJTERATITRE ix THE ROMANTIC PERIOD .

		* For the earlier volumes of `` The

		is the sole representative of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	learn - ing .

		The absence of any chapter from Amer - ica might be explained by the fact that a supplementary enterprise , `` The Cambridge History of American Literature , '' which is now in preparation , has been entrusted to American hands it is , indeed , mainly an American venture .

		But , as in Volume X. , the bibliographies here and there betray an inex - cusable ignorance of books and articles that have been published in this country .

		One has a feeling that some of our English cousins more readily tolerate American scholarship when it concerns itself with Old and Middle English , or with the Elizabethans and
Milton	PERSON	, and are less complacent when we offer to inter - pret the modern poets .

		Of the sixteen chapters , eight are by persons whom we have come to recognize as steady contributors : Mr.
Previte-Orton	PERSON	deals with `` Political Writers and Speakers '' ; Professor
Sorley	PERSON	with ``
Bentham	PERSON	and the Early Utilita - rians '' ; Mr. Child with
Cowper	PERSON	and with
Crabbe ; Professor Saintsbury	ORGANIZATION	with
Southey	PERSON	, with `` The Prosody of the Eighteenth Cen - tury , '' and with `` The Growth of the Later Novel '' ; and Mr.
Harold Routh	PERSON	with `` The Georgian Drama . ' '

		Practice , and an ability to anticipate the plans and wishes of the editors , are sure to tell in a work of this sort ; the chapter by Mr.
Routh	PERSON	, for example , is a model in perspective and compression , without undue sacrifice of interest .

		Nor are the authors of the remaining chapters all new ; Mr.
Aldis	PERSON	has appeared before , and so have Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, Mr.
Yaughan	PERSON	, and Professor
Grierson	PERSON	.

		It would be idle to repeat the table of con - tents .

		We must single out a few chapters for special mention .

		The first , that of Professor
Grierson	PERSON	on
Burke	PERSON	, opens with a laborious sen - tence containing ninety-nine words and a date .

		Once in motion , however , we are carried along easily on a stream that more than once reminds us of the tide in the eloquence of the master - orator himself .

		Professor
Grierson	PERSON	, rising to the height of his great argument , has produced an essay -LRB- if one be allowed to predict -RRB- that will have a lasting place in the literature on
Burke	PERSON	.

		It is clear ; it is orderly ; it is elevated in tone ; it displays true philosophic insight .

		And it has memorable passages , such as this one on
Burke	PERSON	's temperament : '' The sensitive , brooding imagination , which , coupled with a restless , speculative intellect , seek - ing ever to illuminate facts by principles , gives tone to
Burke	PERSON	's speeches and pamphlets ; for it is this temperament which imparts vividness and color to the dry details of historical and statistical knowledge , and it is this temperament which at once directs , keeps in check , and prescribes its limits to , that speculative , inquiring intellect . ''

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	Again : '' Of the three means by which
Cicero	PERSON	, following the Greeks , declares that the orator achieves his end of winning over men 's minds , docendo , con - ciliando , permovendo , tradition and the evidence of his works point to
Burke	PERSON	's having failed chiefly in the second .

		He could delight , astound , and con - vince an audience .

		He did not easily conciliate and win them over .

		He lacked the first essential and index of the conciliatory speaker , lenitas vocis ; his voice was harsh and unmusical , his gesture ungainly .

		The high qualities , artistic and intellectual , of his speeches are better appreciated by readers and students than by ' even the most illustrious of those who watched that tall gaunt figure with its whirling arms , and listened to the Niagara of words bursting and shrieking from those impetuous lips . ' ''

		And once more : ''
Burke	PERSON	's unique power as an orator lies in the peculiar interpenetration of thought and passion .

		Like the poet and the prophet , he thinks most pro- foundly when he thinks most passionately .

		When he is not deeply moved , his oratory verges toward the turgid ; when he indulges feeling for its own sake , as in parts of Letters on a Regicide Peace , it becomes hysterical .

		But , in his greatest speeches and pamphlets , the passion of
Burke	PERSON	's mind shows itself in the luminous thoughts which it emits , in the imagery which at once moves and teaches , throwing a flood of light not only on the point in question , but on the whole neighboring sphere of man 's moral and political nature . ''

		This is not the only striking chapter in the volume .

		Professor
Legouis	PERSON	of the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, whose career began with a study of the French officer Beaupuy mentioned in `` The Prelude / ' and whose reputation was assured through a notable interpretation of that poem , now utters , as it were , his final judgment upon
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		In the interval , the skill of the critic has not diminished , but probably in - creased ; his sentences are packed with thought and solid information ; and his conception of
Wordsworth	PERSON	as carrying on the tradition of
Rousseau	PERSON	, with modifications from the philoso - phy of
Burke	LOCATION	, is subtly elaborated , and pre - sented with the grace and charm which we have come to expect from the school of
Alexandre Beljame	PERSON	.

		And yet one reads this chapter with a sense of disillusionment .

		It is as if the author had lost something of his initial interest in the poet .

		His former knowledge , which chiefly bore upon the early life of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and upon the proximate origins of Wordsworthian ideas , is duly resuscitated ; but it would seem that for the poet 's subsequent activity
M. Legouis	PERSON	to some extent has been swayed by secondary sources of opinion , so that the views expressed , while far from being stereotyped , and reflecting conventional criticism only in a general way , can hardly be said to possess the freshness and independence of his work on '' The Prelude . ''

		If his estimate is conven - tional , this appears in his treatment of `` The Excursion , '' and , still more , of the `` Ecclesi - astical Sonnets . ''

		Indeed , it is unsafe to ap - praise ' ' The Excursion '' as a narrative poem , or , as many others do , to disparage it as not entirely composed in a lyrical or impassioned style ; the style was not so intended , nor yet was it meant to be that of an epic .

		`` The Excursion '' is a dialogue , and must be judged according to the laws governing this form of art ; one does well to read Plato -LRB- who is not always impassioned -RRB- before taking up a mod - ern Platonist or Neoplatonist ; and it may be said that the poem of
Wordsworth	PERSON	endures comparison with other English dialogues .

		As for the `` Ecclesiastical Sonnets , '' so few per - sons look at them , not to speak of studying them with care , that in the popular opinion they would seem to be negligible .

		M. Legouis says they are ' ' the Anglican counterpart , on a much narrower basis , of Chateaubriand 's Genie du Christianisme . ''

		They are , how - ever , founded upon good authorities , such as
Bede	PERSON	and
Sharon Turner	PERSON	, and reveal a schol - arly method to which Chateaubriand was a stranger .

		Montalembert , saturated with the spirit of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, praised some of them at least very highly .

		If we view them in the lineage , not of Chateaubriand , but of Her - bert and
Keble	LOCATION	, if we find their place in the main course , not of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literature , but of religious poetry in
England	LOCATION	, we are more likely to appreciate their true significance .

		One hesitates to enter the lists against an interpreter so expert and so well-prepared ; but
M. Legouis	PERSON	, as it seems to the present writer , has considered the poetry of Words - worth too exclusively in the light of imme - diate circumstances , and of Revolutionary influences and French ideals , and too little sw6 specie eternitatis .

		The remarks of Mr.
Vaughan	PERSON	on
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	suffer in comparison .

		For one thing , his chap - ter is marred by censurable carelessness in matters of detail .

		For example , he says that the beginnings of the opium habit ' ' go back as far as 1797 '' ;
Coleridge	PERSON	certainly began to take laudanum before that .

		He speaks of an impalpable quality illustrated by the line '' Enclosing sunny spots of greenery , '' where
Coleridge	PERSON	wrote Enfolding .

		He speaks of `` the ghastly colors which ` patched the bones ' of Death in a verse which the subtle instinct of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	led him subsequently to strike out . ''

		`` Patched the bones '' is a bad misquotation ; and the criticism of friends , and of the reviewers , had much to do with the excision by
Coleridge	PERSON	of grotesque and repul -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 207 sive images from `` The Rime of the Ancient Mariner . ''

		Again , there is slipshod work in the statement that
Southey	PERSON	`` pronounced the poem to be ` an attempt at the Dutch sub - lime . ' ''

		What
Southey	PERSON	wrote was , `` a Dutch attempt at German sublimity . ''

		Pie probably did not think ill of the thing attempted , since the supernatural was his own field , and he could himself learn from
Burger	LOCATION	; he thought the attempt awkward .

		But the obvious errors are not the only ones in the chapter .

		Taking issue with the utterance of Coleridge himself , '' ' I can not write without a body of thought , ' ' Mr.
Vaughan	PERSON	says of ' ' Kubla Khan '' : ' ' While thought alone , however inspiring , is powerless to make poetry , pure imagery and pure music , even without thought -LRB- if such a thing be pos - sible -RRB- , suffice , when working in absolute har - mony , to constitute what pedantry alone could deny to be a great poem . ''

		If it be pedantry to desire depth of thought in poetry and music , as well as in criticism , the present writer can - not evade the impeachment ; holding , in fact , the opinion of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	as elsewhere ex - pressed : ' ' Poetry is certainly something more than good sense ; but it must be good sense , at all events ; just as a palace is more than a house , but it must be a house , at least . ''

		As for the sense of the criticism , if thought be - comes inspiring , will it not produce something artistic ?

		But can thought exist without imagery that is , without organic sensation ?

		Psychologists , we believe , say it can not .

		And what does our author mean by the words , `` if such a thing be possible '' ?

		If imagery and music without thought are not possible , so much the better for the human mind and for human art ; in that case , there can be no such thing as `` pure '' imagery , and no poetry that is `` pure '' sound and fury , signifying nothing ; though there can be intentional and uninten - tional nonsense in both poetry and prose . ' '

		If such a thing be possible '' implies that the con - text in which it is found may be nonsense ; and that is .

		what we strongly suspect it is .

		Instead of assuming that '' ` the body of thought ' does not obtrude itself for the simple reason that there is no thought to obtrude , '' how much better would be the plan of trying to find out what the content of ' '
Kubla Khan	PERSON	' ' really is !

		As the present writer pointed out some years ago , the poem , when attentively examined , takes its place among the many de - scriptions of the terrestrial paradise .

		There is a description of the Tartar paradise at the beginning , an allusion to the Abyssinian para - dise in the middle , and an apparent reference to the false paradise of the Persian necro - mancer Aladdin at the end ; and there are various reminiscences from the fourth book of `` Paradise Lost '' and from
Bartram	PERSON	's `` Travels '' -LRB- in
Florida	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, etc. -RRB- inter - mingled ; the whole being drawn together by no inner bond of necessary sequence , but by casual association .

		The poem is not a great one ; its unquestionable merits do not suffi - ciently outweigh the latent defects for that .

		It would be greater if , as in the fourth book of `` Paradise Lost , '' or in the twenty-eighth canto of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's `` Purgatorio , '' the sensuous element , the flesh , had a distinct form , so as to give unmistakable significance to the whole .

		And beautiful and melodious as the parts may be , where the heart should be there is some - thing repulsive :
Coleridge	PERSON	suggests that the place is `` holy '' as being the scene of demoniac love `` A savage place !

		as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover ! ''

		That reminds one of the essential indelicacy of ''
Christabel	PERSON	, '' and of other passages in which the poet has utilized repulsive ideas , from works on demonology , which may not be clear to the uninstructed reader , but which must be reckoned with in studying the genius of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	- ridge .

		We must discover where the poet is laudable , and where he is open to censure .

		Mr.
Vaughan	PERSON	praises without discrimination .

		Thus he says of `` The Rime of the Ancient Mariner '' that `` the story shapes itself in a succession of images unsurpassed for poetic power and aptness '' : whereas
Hawthorne	PERSON	called attention to the absurdity of a seaman going about his nautical tasks when there was hanging upon his neck a bird with wings meas - uring thirteen feet across .

		This is not to minimize the loveliness of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	at his best ; the aim is to show the want of precision in an unwary critic in one who does not verify his references , and who has the corre - sponding habit of careless generalization .

		As Mr.
Vaughan	PERSON	has previously worked in the field of literary criticism , it may be well to touch upon one matter there .

		In the passage commonly referred to -LRB- `` Ars Poetica '' 333-4 -RRB- .

		Horace does not say that `` the object of poetry is to instruct '' -LRB- p. 148 -RRB- .

		He describes what poets actually wish to do , dividing them into three classes : `` Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poetee Aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere vitee . ''

		They wish either to profit , or to delight , or to do both in one .

		It is not a question of what they ought to do , but of characteristic desires ; and it is true to the facts .

		Of the chapters hitherto unmentioned , that of Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	on
Blake	PERSON	deserves high com - mendation .

		There is nothing better on the subject .

		Chapter XIV. , on `` Book Produc - 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	tion and Distribution , 1625-1800 , '' by Mr.
H. G. Aldis	PERSON	, gives a very interesting picture of the relations between author and publisher in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, of the activities of Tonson ,
Lintot	LOCATION	,
Dodsley	LOCATION	, and
Miller	PERSON	in the eighteenth , and of the circumstances which gave rise to such collections of the English poets as those of
Bell	ORGANIZATION	and
Johnson	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	also does well with `` The
Bluestock	PERSON	- ings , '' and Mr.
Darton	PERSON	with `` Children 's Books , '' beginning with the earliest specimens .

		The bibliography appended to this final chap - ter fills about seventeen pages , and is an achievement in itself ; it should attract the notice of parents and teachers , who will not elsewhere find so excellent a guide .

		The author of the chapter is evidently responsible for the list .

		For several other lists the case is different , and the results are not always happy .

		In the
Bibliography of Wordsworth	ORGANIZATION	, Knight 's Ev - ersley Edition -LRB- 1896 -RRB- should not have been made a mere adjunct to his earlier and infe - rior
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Edition ; Mr. No well
C. Smith	PERSON	should not be disguised as ``
Smith	PERSON	, C. N. '' ; negligible anthologies like that of
A. J. George	PERSON	should have been omitted ; and under ' ' Biog - raphy and Criticism , '' there should be more entries from American scholarly periodicals .

		On p. 455 the page-heading properly changes to `` Coleridge '' ; but on pp. 457 , 459 , reappears ``
William Wordsworth	PERSON	'' ' a confusing over - sight .

		The list of books on
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	mentions the recent bibliography of
T. J. Wise	PERSON	, but not that of
J. L. Haney	PERSON	-LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
1903	DATE	-RRB- , which , with its entries of books and articles on the poet , is indispensable to students .

		Under `` Biography and Criticism , ''
Lucas	PERSON	's `` Life of Charles Lamb '' ought by all means to have been included ; it would be easy to add a dozen other important titles .

		In the work as a whole there is a certain awkwardness of arrangement .

		Why should
Blake	PERSON	-LRB- 1757-1827 -RRB- precede Burns -LRB-
1759	DATE	-
1796	DATE	-RRB- , and both follow
Wordsworth	PERSON	-LRB-
1770	DATE	-
1850	DATE	-RRB- and
Coleridge	PERSON	-LRB- 1772-1834 -RRB- ?

		But we must not quarrel with the volume .

		The chapters on
Burke	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Blake	PERSON	, which are not the only significant ones , would be enough to redeem it from defects far more serious than any we have noted .

		EYE-WITNESSES AT THE SHAMBLES .

		* Mr.
Irvin S. Cobb	PERSON	's `` Paths of Glory '' easily deserves first place among recent books about the war .

		Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	has an unusual talent for description , and his pages disclose a character typically American .

		He saw the war largely through German eyes and under German auspices , and he retained throughout something closely approximating a judicial poise ; certainly there is always the manifest intention to be just and an almost meticulous adherence to fact .

		Nevertheless , the very per - fection of the machine , the subordination of the individual to the orders of an admitted superior , leave a sense of outraged American - ism behind , as in such an innocent instance as this : '' The turf was scarred with hoof prints and strewed with hay ; and there was a row of small trenches in which the Germans had built their fires to do their cooking .

		The sod , which had been removed to make these trenches , was piled in neat little terraces , ready to be put back ; and care plainly had been taken by the troopers to avoid damaging the bark on the trunks of the ash and elm trees . ''

		There it was the German system of warfare !

		These Germans might carry on their war after the most scientifically deadly plan the world has ever known ; they might deal out their peculiarly fatal brand of drumhead justice to all civilians who crossed their paths bearing arms ; they might burn and waste for punishment ; they might lay on a captured city and a whipped province a tribute of foodstuffs and an indemnity of money heavier than any civilized race has ever demanded of the cowed and conquered might do all these things and more besides but their common troopers saved the sods of the greensward for replanting and spared the boles of the young shade trees ! ''

		None of the reproduced photographs which accompanied the serial publication of Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	's narrative have been used in his book , but there is no need for them , so pictorial are his words and so interpretative his attitude toward what he saw .

		Above all , perhaps , is the sincere American attitude he preserves from cover to cover of his interesting volume .

		He detested the thought of war before ever he saw it or its consequences ; and when he was brought face to face with these he abomi - nated it and the spirit which calls men to * PATHS OF GLORY .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 209 slaughter .

		His hatred for the wickedness of what he saw and sympathy with those who suffer from this wickedness has produced a work of literature , a profoundly sad criti - cism of life .

		Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, like most of his countrymen , probably admired
Germany	LOCATION	but did not like it before he met it in war ; since that time he has had reason for a more active sentiment of dislike , which he sets forth in his `` With the Allies , '' recounting his expe - riences in
Belgium	LOCATION	from shortly after the German invasion of that peaceful country un - til the fall of
Antwerp	LOCATION	.

		He fell into the hands of German officers and for more than a day was under condemnation to die as a spy , in spite of his possession of a passport signed by the American minister , Mr.
Brand Whitlock	PERSON	.

		His long experience as a war correspondent , almost always with regular soldiers , had not prepossessed him with conscript armies to begin with , and certain unpleasant Prussian habits , such as threatening civilians with a drawn revolver , did not change his opinions .

		His judgment of the German army is worth quoting , as follows : '' It is , perhaps , the most efficient organization of modem times ; and its purpose only is death .

		Those who cast it loose upon
Europe	LOCATION	are military - mad .

		And they are only a very small part of the German people .

		But to preserve their class they have in their own image created this terrible engine of destruction .

		For the present it is their servant .

		But , ' though the mills of God grind slowly , yet they grind exceeding small . '

		And , like
Franken	PERSON	- stein 's monster , this monster , to which they gave life , may turn and rend them . ''

		At the close of his book Mr.
Davis	PERSON	has an inter - esting discussion about the war correspondent and the attitude of the European war offices toward him .

		It goes to bear out the general impression in the
United States	LOCATION	that war is so essentially stupid that its votaries become in - capacitated from seeing the rest of life in true proportion .

		The contents of Mr.
E. Alexander Powell	PERSON	's book , `` Fighting in
Flanders	LOCATION	, '' have all ap - peared in a number of American daily news - papers .

		So rapidly do the events of the war march , in spite of the stalemate at present , that the volume fails of interest through no fault of its own ; certainly the events it de - scribes are of the first consequence .

		The most famous passage in it is that relating the inter - view between Mr.
Powell	PERSON	and
General von Boehn	ORGANIZATION	, commanding one of the armies of invasion , in which the American cited to him specific instances of atrocious conduct on the part of his soldiers .

		The German replied : '' Such things are horrible if true .

		Of course , our soldiers , like soldiers in all armies , sometimes get out of hand and do tilings which we would never tolerate if we knew it .

		At
Louvain	LOCATION	, for example , I sentenced two soldiers to twelve years ' penal servi - tude each for assaulting a woman . ''

		It is in this book that the adventures of Mr.
Donald Thompson	PERSON	, the photographer from
Kansas	LOCATION	, are related , and they make an inter - esting chapter in the study of American na - tional character .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's observations are as follows : '' In all the annals of modern war I do not believe there is a parallel to this little Kansas pho - tographer halting , with , peremptory hand , an ad - vancing army and photographing it , regiment by regiment , and then having a field-gun of the Impe - rial Guard go into action solely to gratify his curiosity . ''

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's photographs are used to illus - trate the book , and bear out the conclusions of the text , which will probably be accepted as true by everybody in the world except the Germans .

		The ``
Paris	LOCATION	War Days '' of Mr.
Charles Inman Barnard	PERSON	can scarcely be said to be a book at all , its contents comprising nothing more than the notes of a newspaper correspon - dent long resident in
Paris	LOCATION	, with occasional conclusions arrived at from his knowledge of the life there .

		But the author is none the less right in holding that even this slender information will be welcomed by the
Ameri	PERSON	- can public as adding to the general fund of knowledge which has made our people , except such of them as refuse to read the American and English books and papers , by far the best informed in the world .

		Among the various episodes which the German government has not yet succeeded in explaining away is the reason given for declaring war , thus : ``
August 3	DATE	...
Germany	LOCATION	officially declared war upon
France	LOCATION	at five forty-five
this evening	TIME	.

		The notification was made by
Baron von Schoen	PERSON	, the German Ambassador to
France	LOCATION	, when he called at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	to ask for his pass - ports .


Baron von Schoen	PERSON	declared that his Govern - ment had instructed him to inform the Government of the Republic that French aviators had flown over
Belgium	LOCATION	and that other French aviators had flown over
Germany	LOCATION	and dropped bombs as far as
Nuremburg	LOCATION	.

		He added that this constituted an act of aggression and violation of German territory .

		M.
Viviani	PERSON	listened in silence to
Baron von Schoen	PERSON	's statement , and when the German Ambassador had finished , replied that it was absolutely false that French aviators had flown over
Belgium	LOCATION	and Ger - many and had dropped bombs . ''

		As a result of a conversation with
M. Jules Cambon	PERSON	on his return to
Paris	LOCATION	from the
Embassy	ORGANIZATION	to
Germany	LOCATION	, eked out by interviews with those accompanying him , Mr.
Barnard	PERSON	says : ''
M. Cambon	PERSON	drew an important distinction be - tween German diplomacy and the German military 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	clique .

		The former were willing only to go so far as risking a war , while the latter seized the oppor - tunity to bring on the war and attack
France	LOCATION	.

		The discussion lasted two or three days , and the mili - tary caste , receiving the strong personal encourage - ment and support of Emperor
William	PERSON	, became omnipotent , and from that moment war was in - evitable .

		In regard to
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	constantly repeated the formula : ' Put strong pressure upon
Russia	LOCATION	, your ally , to prevent her from helping the Servians ! '

		To this
France	LOCATION	replied : ' Very good , but you yourself should put strong pressure upon
Austria	LOCATION	, your ally , to prevent her from provoking a catastrophe ! ''

		To this
Germany	LOCATION	rejoined : ` Ah !

		But that is not the same thing ! '

		Thus it was in that cercle vicieux that the diplomatic conversation continued , which , under the circumstances , and especially owing to the attitude of Emperor Wil - liam , could end in nothing else but war . ''

		The book is dedicated to Mr.
Ogden Mills Reid	PERSON	in memory of his father , the late
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	, under whose editorship the author be - gan his career as a foreign correspondent .

		It bears just tribute to the value of the services of our ambassador , Mr.
Myron Herrick	PERSON	.

		It was a good idea of Mr.
James A. Kilpat	PERSON	- rick 's to embody into permanent form the numerous narratives of interest that were pub - lished from time to time in the British and Irish newspapers and give it the self-explana - tory title of ' '
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	at War as Told in His Own Letters . ' '

		By dividing the letters into chapters , ' ' Off to the Front , '' ' ' Humor in the Trenches , '' `` The Intrepid Irish , '' `` The War in the Air , '' and so on , to the number of thirteen , a consecutive series of pictures is presented , which constitute the most vivid impressions imaginable .

		One sups so full of horrors day by day since the beginning of this most awful of all wars that strong meat in - deed is required to jolt the jaded appetite , but this book will do it .

		One therefore reads with entire accord the compiler 's statement that `` In spite of the hatreds this war has engen - dered there is still room for passages of fine sympathy and chivalry . ' '

		He goes on to say : '' One young French lieutenant distinguished himself by carrying a wounded Uhlan to a place of safety under heavy German fire , English soldiers have shown equal generosity and kindness to in - jured captives , and the tributes to heroic and patient nurses shine forth in letters of gold upon the dark pages of this tragic history . ''

		Even more welcome , perhaps , because it finds a partial excuse for an oft-repeated tale of violations of the laws of war by the enemy is contained in the following paragraph : '' Stories of German treachery are abundant , and official reports have dealt with such shameful prac - tices as driving prisoners and refugees in front of them when attacking , abusing the protection of the
White Flag	ORGANIZATION	, and wearing Red Cross brassards in action .

		The men have their own stories to tell .

		An Irish Guardsman records a white flag incident dur - ing the fighting on the Aisne : ' Coldstreamers , Connaughts , Grenadiers , and Irish Guards were all in this affair , and the fight was going on well .

		Sud - denly the Germans in front of us raised the
White Flag	ORGANIZATION	, and we ceased firing and went up to take our prisoners .

		The moment we got into the open , fierce fire from concealed artillery was turned on us , and the surrendered Germans picked up their rifles and pelted us with their fire .

		It was horrible .

		They trapped us completely , and very few escaped . '

		The German defense of these white flag incidents was given to Trooper
G. Douglas	PERSON	by a prisoner who declared that the men were quite innocent of inten - tion to deceive , but that whenever their officers saw the White Flag they hauled it down , and compelled them to fight . ''

		In some senses the most interesting of all these books is the one that deals least with actual fighting , relating the adventures of
Millicent Duchess	PERSON	of
Sutherland	LOCATION	during `` Six Weeks at the War . ''

		The Duchess left En - gland on
August 8	DATE	to join a branch of the
French Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and , after seeing what could be done that would be useful , sent back to her home and procured a surgeon and eight trained nurses and the funds needed for the ``
Millicent Sutherland	PERSON	Ambulance , '' to be stationed at
Namur	LOCATION	and eventually to find their duties at the convent of the
Sisters of Notre-Dame	ORGANIZATION	there .

		The German occupation forced the English party to return about the seventh of
September	DATE	, and they did their best to get into
France	LOCATION	, there to continue their work of mercy .

		But it was found impossible , and they returned to
Brussels	LOCATION	and through the efforts of the American Legation soon reached
Holland	LOCATION	, taking ship for
England	LOCATION	on
September 18	DATE	.

		So remote from any custom - ary experience were the adventures of the Duchess and so far removed from the sanity and common sense of every-day living was the treatment accorded her by those she met that the rational mind finds almost as much sheer nonsense in her calm and entertaining recital of events as in `` Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	. ''

		The English mind and the German never seemed quite to meet , and as the results never went further than to cause inconveniences sensibly borne , there is an element of true humor in the narrative .

		When , for example , the Duchess reached
Brussels	LOCATION	on her way home , she found herself a prisoner in her hotel with guards stationed at her door .

		She sent a note to the American Minister , Mr.
Brand Whitloek	PERSON	.

		and what follows is best told by herself : '' He most kindly came , but at my door the sen - tries refused to let him in .

		He told me afterward that he went to the Kommandantur and ' raised ! '

		The result was very successful .

		An offi - cer came round with him , cursed the sentries as
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 211 if it was their fault and they were removed .

		The American Minister , Mr.
Brand Whitlock	PERSON	, is a very agreeable man .

		He had been appointed by President
Wilson	PERSON	as Minister to
Brussels	LOCATION	for a rest cure !

		... Unfortunately for him destiny has checkmated his rest cure , but I am quite sure that this man of peace was in a great many ways check - mating the Germans . ''

		It is to be said that , though the Duchess is in no sense of the word a professional writer , she has so fully developed the faculty often found in women of the world of saying what she thinks and conveying in words how she feels that many a trained writer would give an eye for it .

		WALLACE RICE .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* A surprisingly good novel by Mr.
Ernest Poole	PERSON	-LRB- a new writer , as far as we are in - formed -RRB- , is entitled ' ' The Harbor . ' '

		It offers an epitome of American life at the present time , taking the harbor of
New York	LOCATION	as a symbol .

		Dante 's famous description of the Sacred Poem might be taken as Mr.
Poole	PERSON	's text . ''

		The meaning of this work is not sim - ple , but rather can be said to be of many sig - nifications , that is , of several meanings ; for there is one meaning that is derived from the letter , and another that is derived from the things indicated by the letter .

		The first is called literal , but the second allegorical or mystical . ' '

		The author himself puts the mat - ter more bluntly when he makes his hero say , near the end of the book : `` I have seen three harbors : my father 's harbor which is now dead ,
Dillon	PERSON	's harbor of big companies which is very much alive , and
Joe Kramer	PERSON	's harbor which is struggling to be born .

		It 's an inter - esting age to live in .

		I should like to write the truth as I see it about each kind of harbor . ''

		Of the first two harbors we should say that Mr.
Poole	PERSON	had written the truth ; of the third , we are far from certain .

		The transition which has taken place , within a generation , from the age of competitive individual enterprise to the age of organized efficiency , is clearly set before us .

		The teller of the story , which is auto - biographical in form , is the son of an old ship - master and dock-owner , whose prime has seen the great age of American shipping , and who , in his declining years , has watched its disap - pearance from the seas , and felt what seem to be the foundations of life crumble beneath his feet .

New York	LOCATION	:

		spell of
Dillon	PERSON	, an engineer whose daughter he marries , and who has a splendid vision of the city beautiful , based upon a glorified harbor and the most enlightened organization of its ancillary industries .

		To the boy , the harbor has seemed repellantly ugly , but to the young man , learning to know it intimately , and studying its various aspects under the enthusi - astic guidance of his chief -LRB- and father-in-law -RRB- it grows to be a thing of awful beauty with amazing possibilities for the redemption of social life .

		But working all the time counter to
Dillon	PERSON	's influence is the influence of
Joe Kramer	PERSON	, a college friend , a modern of the moderns , who scorns their college teaching as `` news from the graveyard , '' and develops into a wild-eyed socialist , bent only upon the upsetting of the comfortable order of society , and seeing in the harbor only a vast capital - istic engine for the crushing of human lives .

		There is nothing constructive about
Kramer	PERSON	's ideals , but only a fierce conviction that any - thing would be better than the existing state of affairs , and an absolute inability to partici - pate in
Dillon	PERSON	's vision of social amelioration through enhanced efficiency and the applica - tion of directive intelligence to industrial affairs .

		The hero , whose part in the drama is that of a professional writer for newspapers and magazines , gradually finds doubts creep - ing into his mind , and becomes more and more swayed by sympathy with
Kramer	PERSON	's material - istic aims and aspirations .

		To our mind there is no doubt as to the ascendancy and ultimate triumph of
Dillon	PERSON	's ideals , because they mean the victory of intellectualism over emotional - ism in human affairs , and it is something of a disappointment that the hero should come to waver between the two views .

		When we take leave of him , he is struggling with a confused sense that there is something big and unappre - hended in the cause of which
Kramer	PERSON	has been the protagonist , and for which , as the ring - leader of a riot of striking dockers , he has very nearly forfeited his life to the law .

		The char - acterization in the novel is fine , although the two women -LRB- the hero 's wife and sister -RRB- do not quite take hold of our sympathies as we wish they might ; but the hero , his father , and the two men who most influence him , are genuine creations .

		In style and temper , this book re - minds us strongly of the two novels of Mr.
Albert Edwards	PERSON	, to say nothing of its being concerned with the same sort of subject - matter .

		Turning from this vivid piece of modern realism to Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's `` The Sword of Youth , '' we are plunged into the very different atmosphere of sentimental ro - mance , tinged with psychological subtlety , and 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	delighting in word-painting for its own sake .

		The story is of the slightest , but , considering the nature of some of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's recent per - formances , we may be glad that the book he now gives us has any story at all .

		Here is an episode of the Civil War , the story of a
Ken	PERSON	- tucky boy who , on his seventeenth birthday , determines to join the Confederate cause for which his father and four brothers have al - ready sacrificed their lives .

		To do this , he must forsake his sweetheart , and leave his mother to struggle alone with the difficulties of an impoverished farm .

		Two years then elapse , and the boy , now a veteran soldier , is with the
Army of Northern Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, the for - lorn last hope of the Confederacy , on the eve of the fall of Kichmond and the end of all things .

		A letter gets through to him with the information that his mother is dying , and an appeal to come to her before it is too late .

		He at once deserts , and reaches his
Kentucky	LOCATION	home only to find that it is too late .

		Then he goes back to Lee 's camp , makes his confession , and is pardoned .

		The end of the tale leaves him in the arms of his betrothed .

		This is all of the story ; it is eked out to novelistic volume by what we should call padding were it not the writing of so artistic a stylist and sugges - tive an intelligence as those of Mr.

		A minor but irritating inaccuracy is the spelling 11
Clarke	PERSON	'' for the name of the explorer ; a more serious lapse is the implication that slavery no longer existed in
Kentucky	LOCATION	in the
autumn of 1863	DATE	.

		Of course , the Declaration had no application to the slave states that re - mained in the
Union	LOCATION	, and it was not until the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment that the
Kentucky	LOCATION	slaves were legally emancipated .

		Miss
Clothilde Graves	ORGANIZATION	, who writes under the pen-name of ``
Richard Dehan	PERSON	, '' has added to `` The Dop Doctor '' and `` Between Two Thieves , '' a third novel of similar dimensions .

		`` The Man of Iron , '' with
Bismarck	PERSON	for its central figure , treats of the Franco-Prussian War with the methods employed by `` Between Two Thieves '' for the Crimean War .

		The book has taken over two years to write -LRB- as well it might ! -RRB-

		, according to the preface , which thus magniloquently states this simple fact : `` For the second time , since this book 's begin - ning , the rose of
June	DATE	had flamed into splen - did bloom .

		I drew breath , for my task approached its ending , and looked up from the yellowed newspaper records of a great War waged forty-four years ago . ''

		What she saw the world knows only too well .

		But , beholding it , she further says : '' I see no cause to blot .

		a line that I have written .

		For the
Germany	LOCATION	of
1870	DATE	was not the
Germany	LOCATION	of
1914	DATE	.

		The New Spirit of Teutonism had not shown itself in those dead days I have tried to testify ... Could the relentless exponent of the fierce gospel of blood and iron have foreseen the imminent , approaching disintegration of his colossal life-work , under the hands of his suc - cessors could he have known what Dead Sea fruit of ashes and bitterness his fatal creed , grafted upon the oak of
Germany	LOCATION	, was fated to bring forth he would have drunk ere death of the crimson lees of the Cup of Judgment ; he would have seen in the shape of his pupil the gro - tesque , distorted image of himself . ''

		Both this prophecy and this psychological judgment are probably true ; and , although the author claims to have blotted no line of her story in the light of recent happenings , we may venture to assert that the last words of the heroine to the Iron Chancellor have been penned since the fatal first of
August	DATE	of last year . ''

		You are not a good man , Monseigneur ... Hard , subtle , arrogant , cruel , and unscrupulous , God made you to be the Fate of
France	LOCATION	.

		One day she will lift up her face from the mire into which you have trodden it , and the star will be burning unquenched upon her forehead .

		We may both he dead before that day dawns .

		But rest assured that when your armies cross the Rhine they will not gain an easy victory !

		We shall be prepared and ready , Monseigneur , when the Germans come again ! ''

		These words come at the very close , when the heroine , after having cherished the ambition to become a second
Charlotte Corday	PERSON	, has heeded the scriptural injunction `` Ven - geance is mine ; I will repay '' and has been stirred by compassion to save
Bismarck	PERSON	's life instead of destroying it , takes her leave of the sinister Man of Iron .

		The heroine is a French girl , noble and pure-souled , the daughter of a French officer slain on the battle-field , and of a wicked mother , who has trafficked in both personal and patriotic honor , and who has even sought to drag her own child into the maelstrom of corruption .

		The mother has just met a richly-merited fate , and the daughter is on the way to
England	LOCATION	with the young Irish journalist who has been her faithful lover from the time when he first saw her , and to whom she has given her heart in gladness .

		This Irishman ,
P. C. Breagh	PERSON	by name , is the hero of the story on its private and romantic side , and plays his part acceptably to the reader , if not much more than that .

		He is a free-lance war correspondent , driven into that calling by the accident of having been swin - dled out of his inheritance by a rascally trus - tee .

		To make smooth his future , we are given to understand that the inheritance is eventu - ally to be recovered .

		On the historical side , the novel gives us vital characterizations of
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Moltke	PERSON	, of the pathetic Prince
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 213 Imperial and of his tinsel emperor-father con - cerning whom these burning words are writ - ten : ' ' He had made
France	LOCATION	his mistress and his slave , and now her fetters were to be hacked apart by the merciless sword of the invader .

		Through losses , privations , and hu - miliations ; through an ordeal of suffering unparalleled in the world 's history , through an orgy of vice and an era of infidelity , through fresh oceans of blood shed from the veins of her bravest , she was to pass before she found herself and God again . ''

		This concep - tion of the Terrible Year as a divine judgment upon a beloved but sinning nation is the key - note of the work , which is infused throughout -LRB- we need hardly say -RRB- by the deepest of relig - ious feeling .

		Its war pictures are vivid tran - scripts of reality , its human figures have the stamp of life upon them , and its decorative features are the embodiment of minute and comprehensive knowledge .

		It is all over - wrought , and this lack of restraint in both style and feeling is its chief defect .

		We think it somewhat less impressive than `` Between Two Thieves , '' but we would not willingly have missed reading it .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The test tube , the analytical Mysteries of balanop thp spalnpl nnrl tVip the living world .

		Uct .

		ltJ ce > cupel , dm microscope have marvellously enhanced man 's knowledge of , and his mas - tery over , the forces of nature , enlarged his understanding of his own structure and func - tions , and filled his quiver with new weapons against foes seen and unseen .

		Nature is no longer a sealed book , and superstitious fear of her has forever been banished by men .

		In - deed , he scans the creeping caterpillar and turns it at will by his knowledge of its reac - tions to stimuli , and straightway proclaims mechanism as the all-sufficient and complete explanation of the mystery of life .

		Those who find the mechanistic conception of life satisfy - ing , as well as those who question the adequacy of its foundations and conclusions , will find in Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	's `` The Wonder of Life '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- much food for rumination .

		It is a series of glimpses into the structures , functions , activities , habits , and instincts which characterize living things , and distin - guish them from the non-living world which does not trade with time and transmit its gains to its descendants .

		This is admirably shown hy the marvellous story of the fresh-water eel which migrates from the
Vistula	LOCATION	to the deep ea off
Ireland	LOCATION	for the purpose of spawning , and by the unique transformation of its trans - parent ribbon-like larvae into the still smaller black elvers which make their way back by some secret homing instinct from the open sea to the streams and lakes of the centre of the continent .

		To the mechanist this is no more than the intricate unravelment of chemical reaction , provided only he endows the fleeting and ever-changing molecules of the eel , as they come into and then forever leave its changing body , with all the fundamental properties that the race of eels have accumulated in the ages of their long evolution .

		Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	is a Neo-vitalist of an undogmatic sort , and he has set forth an inviting array of problems for his many materialistic confreres to consider .

		Anything from his pen is sure to be interest - ing , to be marked by lucidity , by a spirit of candor , and by a clearly defined progress to definite conclusions , or at least to a clear state - ment of the problem .

		Although deeply im - bued with the philosophic significance of the fact related , the work is not written in the philosophic tone nor does it employ the phil - osophic vocabulary .

		It is a charming series of natural history word pictures , painted for the most part in newly explored lands , and sketched with a trained hand .

		These countless illustrations of life 's wonders are grouped about seven main themes : the drama of life with its primal impulses of hunger and love ; the haunts of life , or the story of exploitation of the earth to its remotest nooks and corners ; the insurgence of life , or the circumvention of space and the conquest of time by produc - tivity , by adaptation to difficult conditions , by tenacity and plasticity , and by the mysterious instinct of migration that guides the inexpe - rienced fledgling across trackless wastes of land and sea .

		Behavior of animals , or the ways of life , are illustrated by the complex instincts of birds and insects , and the web of life by the intricate interrelations of flowers and insects , of parasites and their hosts , by the story of pearls , and by the complex adapta - tions of the cuckoo , who foists her domestic cares upon other birds .

		The cycle of life is illustrated by the various types of develop - ment under normal and experimental condi - tions , and includes a discussion of parental instincts , and of death .

		The closing chapter , on the wonder of life , is one of unusual inter - est which sums up and elaborates the distin - guishing characteristics of organisms .

		It ranges over a great variety of topics , from anaphallaxis and chemical individuality to sleep and phosphorescence , protective colora - tion , mimicry , and transmission of acquired characters , and closes with an illuminating , if not wholly conclusive , discussion of vitalism as opposed to mechanism .

		214 THE DIAL
March 18	DATE	This is an elementary book , The atom of , , T r T > \ J L the French says Mr.
H. P. Adams	PERSON	in the preface to his brief sketch of the French Revolution -LRB- McClurg -RRB- . ''

		It aims , above all , at making the story clear .

		Its other purpose , no less important , is to indicate the present state of the chief problems associated with the great Revolution . ''

		A book which should really do what Mr.
Adams	PERSON	aims to do , within the space which he has allowed him - self , would be a notable event ; it would be such a book as might be written by a man possessed of the learning of Aulard , the in - sight of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and the constructive and literary talent of , let us say , Mignet .

		In lieu of first-hand knowledge , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has read ``
Acton	LOCATION	,
Sorel	PERSON	,
Aulard	LOCATION	,
Kropotkin	PERSON	,
Belloc	ORGANIZATION	, and the writers of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern His - tory . ''

		These are all very well in their \ vay , but they are so little agreed in their concep - tions of the Revolution that however intelli - gently one may read them -LRB- and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	appears to have read them attentively enough -RRB- a sketch of the subject `` based mainly '' on them is almost sure to lack precisely that merit which Mr.
Adams	PERSON	seeks to attain , namely , clearness .

		Certainly one must have not only a pretty good first-hand knowledge of the Revo - lution , but a considerable appreciation of the influences that have given us such varied inter - pretations of it , before it is possible to recon - cile Aulard ,
Kropotkin	PERSON	, and the `` writers of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History . ''

		To two parts of
Kropotkin	LOCATION	, Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has apparently added one part of Aulard and one of what col - lege students know best as ' ' Mr.
Cambridge	PERSON	. ' '

		The mixture has been well stirred , and spiced with certain generalizations of the author 's own brewing .

		But the trouble is that the ingredients do not combine , and the result is far from clear .

		Fortunately , it is no crime to write an unsatisfactory book about the French Revolution ; and if ' ' the readers for whom -LSB- the book -RSB- is intended '' are such as like to read about the Revolution without going be - yond text books and brief manuals , they will find here , as the author expresses a hope that they may , `` something essentially differing from what they can get from the excellent hand books of similar size that exist . ' '

		The late
John Hays Gardiner	PERSON	's Jd ement v lume on
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in the `` American Colleges and Uni - versities Series '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not a con - ventional history ; it is an impressive account of the institution that was practically created by President
Eliot	PERSON	during the forty years of his administration .

		Some of the items that stick in memory after the book has been read are :
Germany	LOCATION	's major part in the develop - ment of
Harvard	LOCATION	, the way the college attends to the intimate needs of its students , the illus - trious names that have been connected with it , and the inimitableness of its collections .

		There could not be a more inspiring chapter in American education than the one in this book treating the origin , development , and present status of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's libraries .

		And the story of the other collections -LRB- including that of the glass flowers -RRB- does not lag in sug - gestiveness .

		It is good for the soul to read of the equipment for research with which Har - vard is endowed .

		The social life of the stu - dents , as it revolves around athletics and clubs , is set forth in a most enlightening way .

		There is nothing apologetic or patronizing in this connection ; the physical activities seem to prevent dyspepsia and the social ones offish - ness , so that all are pleased .

		The fact that from one-half to two-thirds of the students work their way , partly at least , through Har - vard is viewed optimistically .

		Could not the impecunious do a little far-sighted borrow - ing while in college ?

		The time is at most short , and during this brief space
Sauls	PERSON	are supposed to be metamorphosed into
Pauls	LOCATION	.

		But students have a way the country over of answering this and similar questions to their own apparent satisfaction , and it is their affair .

		If the author of this book thinks that students at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	act wisely , the reader is almost forced to agree , for he sees that Har - vard did well by him .

		The volume was writ - ten with care and love .

		It contains a great mass of detailed information presented in the orthodox Harvard tone : dignified , measured , truth-bearing , unhumorous .

		Arranged as the chapters are , there is an occasional repetition ; the traditional
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	use of the fine-tooth comb as a searching instrument occurs -LRB- it reminds one too much of Murillo -RRB- ; and there is at least one slip : on page 19
Harvard Hall	ORGANIZATION	is said to have burned down on
February 2 , 1764	DATE	, while on page 237 the same disaster is reported to have taken place on
January 24 , 1764	DATE	.

		But these are trivialities which the author would indubitably have attended to had he lived to revise his manuscript .

		All in all , this is at once an inspiring and an instruc - tive account of the way in which
America	LOCATION	's best-known university makes men out of boys and scholars out of men .

		Essays and addresses of a famous surgeon .

		The name of the late Dr.
Roswell	LOCATION	.

		,
Park	LOCATION	, of
Buffalo	LOCATION	, became widely ^ Q ^ f < -RRB- fne genera l pub l ie at the time of President
McKinley	PERSON	's assassination at the
Pan-American Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Holding the office of Medical Director of the Exposition ,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 215 and being also Professor of Surgery in the
University of Buffalo	ORGANIZATION	and Surgeon-in - Chief to the
Buffalo General Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, as well as an acknowledged leader in his profession , he was naturally called upon to minister to the dis - tinguished visitor .

		His absence from the city , however , made it necessary that another hand should perform the immediate operation de - manded by the exigencies of the case .

		His subsequent endeavors to save the patient 's life and his disappointment and distress at failure are matters of history .

		It is to his pen that we owe the '' Selected Papers , Surgical and Scien - tific , '' chosen for publication by two of his colleagues , and issued to subscribers .

		One of these colleagues , Dr.
Charles G. Stockton	PERSON	, has prepared a memoir of Dr. Park , with which the volume opens , and the surgeon 's son
Julian	PERSON	contributes a brief preface and otherwise coop - erates in the editorship of the volume .

		From papers on cancer , a subject of special study , to an inquiry into the ultimate substance or force composing the universe , the writer shows a wide range of interests and attain - ments ; and the clearness and simplicity with which , even to a layman , he succeeds in con - veying his meaning render his writings attrac - tive beyond the circle of those to whom most of them are primarily addressed .

		The picture of the man himself , in Dr.
Stockton	PERSON	's memoir , is by no means the least interesting feature of the volume .

		A portrait of a more literal sort than this literary one faces the title-page .

		England in the later Middle Ages .

		Macaulay found but one fault in his favorite Thucydides , a too close adherence to narrative .

		Since
Macaulay	PERSON	's day experiments in histori - cal writing have been tried in which the con - secutive statement of particular events has been broken for purposes of exposition , or philosophy , or what not .

		For the serious stu - dent of history such an excursus , breaking the narrative , is less enlightening than might be expected .

		`` England in the Later Middle Ages , '' by Professor
Kenneth H. Vickers	PERSON	, of
the University of Durham	ORGANIZATION	, has been criticized as lacking in such `` philosophical '' passages .

		From this criticism we dissent ; there was a noticeable need of a book covering the period from
1272	DATE	to
1485	DATE	in narrative form , and ad - hering as closely as possible to the sources .

		Such a book the third volume of `` A History of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- in seven volumes un - der the general editorship of Professor
Oman	LOCATION	turns out to be .

		Sources only recently avail - able are referred to constantly .

		It is no easy matter to satisfy the specialist and the gen - eral reader in the treatment of these two cen - turies ; in the adoption of his style Professor
Vickers	PERSON	has had the specialist as well as the reader in mind .

		Certainly the decorations of history , dramatic and picturesque details , he has employed with economy .

		One may read well into the narrative of
Agincourt	LOCATION	without realizing it ; but one is bound to admit that the casual account is probably better history than eloquence or dramatic writing after the event .

		Nil admirari and personal detachment mark the book ; and if few will sit down to read the work through , leisure permitting , others will find themselves coming back to it for what is , on the whole , the best narrative of the period yet put together from confused and often contradictory masses of record .

		Par - ticularly to be commended are the maps of campaigns at the end of the volume .

		America 's foremost art museum .

		In form and appearance befit - ting its subject , `` A History of the Metropolitan Museum of Art '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Winifred E. Howe	PERSON	, presents in considerable detail , and with a preliminary chapter on the early art institu - tions of
New York	LOCATION	, a chronological account of the now splendid collection started nearly half a century ago through the activity of a group of
New York	LOCATION	art-lovers , notably enriched some decades later by the discriminating generosity of the late
J. Pierpont Morgan	ORGANIZATION	, fourth presi - dent of the Museum and most zealous and intelligent promoter of its fortunes , and , since
1910	DATE	, under the able directorship of Mr.
Edward Robinson	PERSON	, in succession to Sir
Caspar Purdon Clarke	PERSON	.

		A preface of more than a perfunctory character is contributed by Mr.
Robert W.	PERSON	De Forest , who for more than a quarter of a century has been a trustee of the Museum and has served it in various capaci - ties .

		The preliminary account of the city 's early institutions of art is a notable contribu - tion to local history , filling a third of the volume .

		Prepared before the publication of the recent biography of
Samuel F. B. Morse	PERSON	, first president of the
National Academy of Design	ORGANIZATION	and otherwise prominent in
New York	LOCATION	's early endeavors to become an art centre , the chapter could not avail itself of the considerable relevant material that excellent biography contains ; but it appears to be a thorough and trustworthy piece of work within the limits of its design .

		Many por - traits and other illustrations suitably enrich the volume .

		war and ^ n `` War an < ^ Insurance '' -LRB- Mac - thTiwurance millan -RRB- , Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	.

		has applied his pet theory of dyadic and triadic relations to international affairs .

		The dyadic relations of man to man he considers unstable and fraught with danger : 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	`` A pair of men is what I may call an essen - tially dangerous community . ''

		He sp eaks of it as a law that this dual relation produces fric - tion , and that this friction tends to increase ; and goes on to say that the deepest reason why war is so persistent is that nations , thus far in history , are related chiefly in pairs .

		This would be altered by triads , which , like the normal family father , mother , and child , consist of a group of three parties .

		In the family triad , the winning and common care for the child may charm away many of the influences that threaten to wreck the unity of the home .

		Similarly in any triadic group the interme - diary , corresponding to the child in the fam - ily , transforms the dangerous pair into a harmonious triad , and gives stability and peace .

		Such a group of three Professor
Royce	PERSON	calls a ' ' community of interpretation . ' '

		Besides the family we have such communities of interpretation in the judicial triad -LRB- com - plainant , defendant , judge -RRB- , the banking triad -LRB- investor , borrower , banker -RRB- , and the insur - ance triad -LRB- adventurer , beneficiary , insurer -RRB- .

		Of all relations and practical communities yet devised , the insurance relations and communi - ties most tend to bring peace on earth .

		No adequate effort has been made to further peace through an application of the insurer 's community to international business .

		This Professor
Royce	PERSON	advocates , and he believes , notwithstanding the difficulties discussed in his introduction , that the proposal is practical .

		A mediaeval story in modern dress .

		How well French scholarship .

		, , .

		.

		* '' might teach
America	LOCATION	to unite ^ pQwer Q learning with the forces of daily life has often enough been shown ; yet seldom more clearly than when
M. Joseph Bedier	PERSON	, now foremost among au - thorities on the mediaeval romances , con - structed from several versions a story of Tristan and Iseult which is essentially faithful to tradition , and yet suited to the demands of modern taste , and to the likings of the modern reader .

		Le Roman de Tristan et Iseut , as adapted by this eminent scholar , having been crowned by the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	, has since attracted the services of skilful translators , one of them Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	, whose version is published in this country by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English translation has in some quarters been even more highly praised in point of style than
M. Bedier	PERSON	's adaptation , though his skill in French is great .

		If the praise be too high , it nevertheless serves as a vigorous recommendation of a fascinating book .

		May the volume come into the hands of everyone who knows the tale of Tristan only through the medium of
Wagner !	ORGANIZATION

		In ' ' The English Parish iaeval church Church '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- Mr.
J. Charles Cox	PERSON	has written , out of fulness of knowledge , an admirable brief manual for the amateur .

		It is , as the sub - title proclaims , `` an account of the chief building types and their materials during nine centuries , '' broadly considering the church fabric as a whole rather than individual forms of detail .

		It is in this respect that it contrasts with the more minute treatments of Mr.
Bond	PERSON	, whereas it supplements Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's portfolio of views through its enlightening text .

		Especially vital is the chapter on the gradual growth of church plans .

		The illus - trations , though small , are many and unhack - neyed , selected with a knowledge of the buildings and of the literature which is aston - ishingly wide .

		It is the parish church rather than the cathedral which is the flower of En - glish mediaeval church architecture .

		To the tourist and the student this little volume will prove an excellent guide .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The `` Useful Reference Series '' published by the
Boston Book Company	ORGANIZATION	has two unquestionably useful recent additions in Mr.
Axel Moth	PERSON	's '' Glossary of Library Terms : English , Danish , Dutch , French , German , Italian , Spanish ,
Swed	PERSON	- ish , '' and Miss
Katharine H. Wead	PERSON	's `` List of Series and Sequels for Juvenile Readers . ''

		These are in pamphlet form and constitute numbers ten and eleven , respectively , of the series .

		Technicalities remote and obscure , slang expres - sions , archaic terms , and unusual phrases of all sorts are contained in the index to Mr.
Ralph Durand	PERSON	's `` Handbook to the Poetry of Rudyard Kipling '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		The index alone should convince anyone that a Kipling handbook satisfies a real need .

		The book itself further justifies the assumption .

		It is more than a mere glossary of terms : it is brimful of information about the unheard-of things with which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	whets the curiosity of his readers just the information , in fact , that every Kipling enthusiast wants .

		The well-known Stedman-Woodberry edition of the Works of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, first published in
1895	DATE	in ten volumes , is now re-issued by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	in their `` Library of Modern Authors . ''

		It has been reset in larger type and printed from new plates on paper bearing the author 's initials in water-mark ; the bibliography has been brought down to date , the matter pertaining to the por - traits rearranged , and the text , re-examined by Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, has been revised in the few immaterial points where it has been found wanting .

		The scholarly critical notes , subjected to the same careful re-examination , have been retained .

		Ex - cellent in every detail of book manufacture , this becomes without question the definitive edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

1906	DATE	.

		The publishing business of
Messrs. Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, has been taken over by Mr.
Frank L. Howell	PERSON	, long associated with the old com - pany , and will be conducted under the name of
The Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- not inc. -RRB- , with general offices at 608
South Bearborn St.	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It will be the aim of the new company to maintain the high standard of publishing set by the older concern .

		New publica - tions for the
spring	DATE	will shortly be announced .

		Two books of special interest to come from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	are ''
Mark Rutherford	PERSON	's '' `` Last Pages from a Journal , '' which has been prepared for the press by Mrs.
Hale White	PERSON	, and the late Mr.
W. P. Courtney	PERSON	's '' Bibliography of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	spent an im - mense amount of labor on this task , which he did not live to finish , but his manuscript has had the benefit of revision at the hands of Mr.
B. Nicol Smith	PERSON	.

		218 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 18	DATE	'' Writers of the Day '' is a new series announced by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	the aim of which is to present brief yet comprehensive estimates of au - thors while they are yet alive .

		To the first group of titles now in preparation belong Mr.
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	's ''
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	's ''
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, '' Mr.
W. L. George	PERSON	's `` Anatole
France	LOCATION	, '' Miss
Sheila Kaye-Smith	PERSON	's ''
John Gals	PERSON	- worthy , '' and Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	's '' Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	. ''

		The forthcoming translation of Treitschke 's '' History of
Germany	LOCATION	in the Nineteenth Century '' recently announced in these columns is the joint undertaking of Messrs.
McBride	PERSON	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	and
Messrs. Jarrold & Sons	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The translator is Dr.
M. E. Paul	PERSON	, and the editor is Mr.
William H. Dawson	PERSON	, author of '' The Evo - lution of
Modern Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	will write the supplementary volume of the series , which is to be issued in seven volumes .

		The posthumous book by the late Sister Nivedita , which Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	will have ready imme - diately under the title of '' Footfalls of Indian His - tory , '' deals with the re-interpretation of the great ages of the past of
India	LOCATION	, especially in relation to the social and religious consciousness of the people .

		It will be illustrated in color from water-colors by
Abanindra Nath Tagore	PERSON	, and two other members of the
School of Indian Painters	ORGANIZATION	which has grown up under his inspiration at
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		Russian literature figures prominently in the
spring	DATE	announcements of English publishers .

		We note in particular a new edition of
Gogol	PERSON	's '' Dead Souls , '' with a preface by Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	.

		Another of the great Russian realist novels , '' The Golovleffs , '' by
Shchedrin	PERSON	-LRB- Saltikov -RRB- , is to appear for the first time in an English translation .

		Other announcements include a translation by
J. E. Hogarth	PERSON	of Andreiev 's play , '' The Life of Man , '' which enjoyed a long run at the Arts Theatre in
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		The next batch of volumes to appear in Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	's '' Home University Library '' will comprise a study of
Milton	LOCATION	, by Mr.
John Bailey	PERSON	, whose ''
Johnson	PERSON	and his Circle '' is already among the most successful volumes in the library ; a '' History of Philosophy , '' by Mr.
Clement C. J. Webb	PERSON	; '' Political Thought in
England	LOCATION	, from
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	to the Present Day , '' by Mr.
Ernest Barker	PERSON	; and ``
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
R. C. K. Ensor	PERSON	, who deals with his subject both from the historical and the descriptive standpoint , with maps illus - trating past and present campaigns .

		Short and carefully-considered lists of note - worthy books in various departments of literature are compiled and issued at short intervals by the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, the works named being selected from its own resources .

		For instance , there have lately appeared little paper book bibli - ographies of '' Stories of Romance and Imagina - tion , '' `` Stories of the Sea '' -LRB- romance and fact -RRB- , '' Plays of Thirteen Countries . '' ''

		Favorite Stories of the Library Reading Clubs , '' and , finally , of books dealing mostly with real life , but '' as inter - esting as a novel , '' which much-used phrase is utilized as title .

		`` A History of Travel in
America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Seymour Dunbar	PERSON	, is announced for immediate publication by
Messrs. Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is primarily a story of pioneer conditions , the story of the wilderness road , prairie schooner , dog-sled , and pack-train ; but it is more than that , for in tracing the development of travel to the highly organized railway systems of to-day it becomes a study of the nation 's social and economic evolu - tion involved in the process .

		To the large mass of detailed information are added numerous photo - graphic reproductions of rare early prints , broad - sides , and obscure documents and manuscripts .

		The work will comprise four large volumes .

		New light is thrown on the business world of early
Babylonia	LOCATION	in a book about to be published in the ''
Columbia University Oriental Studies	ORGANIZATION	, '' entitled '' Sumerian Records from Drehem , '' by Dr.
W. M. Nesbit	PERSON	.

		The work contains a collection of inscribed clay tablets recovered from
Drehem	LOCATION	, near the city of
Nippur	LOCATION	, where expeditions from the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	have carried on exca - vations since
1888	DATE	.

		These particular tablets , how - ever , with others , were discovered at Drehem by Arabs and surreptitiously removed before the Turkish authorities could claim them for the
Constantinople Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were afterwards dis - tributed among various private collectors , the col - lection now dealt with being eventually secured for Dr.
Nesbit	PERSON	by Professor Gottheil , of
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity .

		Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	has finished his great biog - raphy of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and the work is announced for publication this
spring	DATE	.

		It is now nearly thirty years since the Danish critic gave his first series of lectures on
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, so that the coming biography will contain the results of a study that has lasted almost for a generation .

		In an interview , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	stated that his book has been written from a European rather than a German point of view , and that its plan differs as much from all existing biographies of Goethe as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's own system of botany does from that of
Linnaeus	LOCATION	.

		He does not expect that his book will be well received in Ger - many , and he is afraid that the bitterness caused by the war will prevent it from having any great success in
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	.

		He has hopes , how - ever , that it will find readers in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		I have often thought , '' says a writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation , '' '' that an interesting parallel could be drawn between contemporary Belgian lit - erature and that of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Both owe a good deal to a more or less self-conscious movement started by a few men in the ` eighties and ` nineties of the last century .

		In both cases there are the two languages , each modifying and influencing the literature produced in the other , and if neither Irish nor Flemish has produced a writer who can compel attention , the Belgian writers of French and the Irish writers of English are deeply in - debted to the other tongue .

		And against the realist , and sometimes brutal ,
Camille Lemonnier	PERSON	.

		Ireland can place Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, while the weight of critical opinion would undoubtedly class
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	and Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	as the two greatest living poets . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 219 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS .

MR. WELLS	PERSON	AND RECONSTRUCTION .

		Almost everybody had one experience at the outbreak of the war , for it gave a sudden check to many forms of thought and action .

		It seemed as if nothing were so theoretical or so remote as to be unaffected .

		In politics , business , philanthropy , even in education , philosophy , art , and many another form of interest , the war interposed a bar even to thought .

		People have not got over that feel - ing .

		There is a sort of indifference , such as comes of the continuance of anything which one can not influence in any way .

		The daily work of life must be done , and it is better ta do it with undivided mind .

		Still it is not easy to get back to the old line of thought .

		There is a tendency to jump the gap , come to the end of the war , and begin anew .

		On this subject there are all sorts of ideas .

		Some people are most gloomy in their fore - bodings ; they predict an intolerable
England	LOCATION	or a predominant Pan-Slavism or an over - powering militarism , or even a new epoch of more tremendous wars .

		Others have a very different view : they see signs of a renais - sance of righteousness ; they believe that peo - ple will get together for a re-assertion of the spiritual in life ; they feel that somehow civilization will draw good out of so great evil .

		No one has thought more on just this sub - ject than Mr.
H. Gr	PERSON	.

		Wells .

		For twenty years he has been constantly turning over in his mind the question of world organization and re-organization .

		Whatever one 's opinion of the value of his thoughts or of his ideas , there is no question as to the abundance of them .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	-LRB- who in some ways can hardly be supposed to admire Mr.
Wells	PERSON	-RRB- thinks of him as showering his ideas upon mankind '' as from a high window ever open . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has sometimes dealt with just this question , as in '' The War in the Air , '' the more recent `` The World Set Free , '' or even such a book as `` In the Days of the Comet , '' in which we have reconstruction not after war , it is true , but after another form of cataclysm .

		Sometimes he has dealt with the general question of ideal society , as in `` An - ticipations , '' `` Mankind in the Making , '' `` A 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	Modern Utopia . ''

		Sometimes he has pre - sented not thought on this subject , but peo - ple thinking , as in `` The New Macchiavelli '' and other such novels .

		Of late he has pub - lished a good deal of particular consideration of the immediate future .

		With Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's past ideas of what war would be or his present ideas of how current circumstances may best be managed , we would not deal at the moment .

		As to the anticipations of the past , we need not sup - pose that they could have been exactly realized , for the present war occurs under circumstances very different from those which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	postulated .

		As to his ideas about the present crisis , we may suppose that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has opportunities very different from ours , so that our criticism would not be illuminating .

		It may be interesting , how - ever , to say a word upon what seem to be Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's controlling ideas , as we see them , let us not say in all his books , but at least as they appear in one place or another , seeming to make on the whole rather a consistent sys - tem .

		Such main ideas have been before the public for a good while .

		Implicit in much of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's thinking on this subject is the idea of a new temper , a new disposition , in mankind .

		We may not think this a very probable condition ; in an earlier book , `` In the Days of the Comet , '' the new disposition was the result of the Great Change caused by the nitrogenous gas dif - fused by the comet .

		After that people were different , and indeed as one read it seemed most natural that they should be different .

		In `` The World Set Free '' Mr.
Wells	PERSON	relied on no such unlikely circumstance ; simply the war brought about such horrible destruction that existence itself was hardly possible for multitudes , and the new order of things made `` an appeal to elements in the nature of man that had hitherto been suppressed . ''

		`` The World Set Free '' is said to have exhausted the reviewers ' stock of adjectives .

		It was pronounced daring , stimulating , apocalyptic , masterly , and so on , as well as timely .

		All this it doubtless was and much more , among other things very plausible .

		And in nothing was it more plausible than in the way in which the world was seen to acquiesce in the assump - tion of authority by those who set themselves the task of reconstruction .

		The conference governed by right of being able to govern ; it obviated interference by allowing any out - sider , who wanted to help , to do his share of the .

		work .

		And , government being a chance to work for those who could work instead of a chance to draw pay for those who had a `` pull , '' affairs went better than nowadays .

		We may have our doubts as to such a plan ; but even so , it appears that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is basing this part of his plan upon a really existing disposition .

		When a number of prominent men in any city get together now - adays to consider some immediate question , such as unemployment at home or want abroad , everyone feels that it is the proper thing , and they carry through their plan with - out anyone wanting to interfere with them , because there is an obvious thing to be done and they can obviously do it .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	develops this idea , common enough in every - one 's experience , upon a large scale .

		With or without such a change in general disposition , the fundamental idea of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's reconstruction is usually a world - order based upon scientific coordination and cooperation .

		`` Science , '' said the abdicating King of
Italy	LOCATION	, in the book , `` is the new king of the world .

		... It is the mind of the race . ' '

		As we see the process in `` The World Set Free '' the first tasks of the administration were , almost of necessity , scientific .

		Here was the population of the world in need of food and shelter .

		It was natural to go about relief in a scientific way ; and if one begins scientifically why not go on ?

		If it is best to have a world-planning committee , why not have city-planning committees ?

		And if one is going to arrange the cities in the best pos - sible way , why not the houses , and so on ?

		Of course in the
United States	LOCATION	we have a general feeling against such universal man - agement .

		We are too near the frontiersman to be willing to do away with the all-around man ' , who can turn his mind to any problem , in favor of the specialist .

		But there is an - other objection suggested -LRB- in earlier works -RRB- by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself , namely , the fact that extreme specialization would have its disad - vantages .

		In `` When the Sleeper Wakes , '' a story of two hundred years ahead , we have two clearly distinguished classes , the workers and the players ; in `` The Time Machine '' two hundred centuries or so ahead the division has become much more marked and we have two distinct species .

		That is Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's view of what our haphazard specialization will re - sult in .

		But in '' The First Men in the
Moon	PERSON	'
' 1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 249 he shows us scientific system , and the result is worse .

		The Selenites were the definite re - sult of systematic selection : those who had to do physical work were all hands or all whatever they had to work
Avith	PERSON	.

		So it was with mental work : one man could remember , one could solve problems .

		The Grand Lunar , their king , w r as -LRB- characteristically -RRB- all brain .

		This specialization seemed painful to the visi - tor from the earth ; though as Mr.
Wells	PERSON	then remarked , it was really more humane to have people grow up into machines than to let them grow up into human beings and then make machines out of them .

		Still that last , of course , was only satire , better have them not machines at all .

		Another point about the scientific coopera - tion which makes such a figure in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's system is its efficiency .

		Now efficiency is rather under a cloud at present , and people who look ahead are inclined to desire not a more efficient civilization but a more spiritual civilization .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's civilization is spir - itual in some senses ; it is certainly not mate - rial or mechanical .

		In `` A Modern Utopia '' we have a civilization far less material than our own and far less bound by the ties of mechanical literalism .

		So also in the little picture at the end of `` The World Set Free '' of the life at the hospital ; indeed , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is always full of ideas which in the simple sense of being not material , not bound by legalism , are spiritual .

		If , however , we imply by `` spiritual , '' as most people do , some rela - tion to a spirit not our own , then it is pretty clear that we are thinking of something out of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's usual sphere .

		As one watches the unfolding of his ideal world one is struck more and more by the fact that it has nothing about it answering to the usual idea of relig - ion .

		It will be remembered that most of the men one hesitates to say heroes in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's books are men who have parted from traditional religion and do not have any obvious substitute for it .

		In some cases Mr.
Wells	PERSON	tells how this came about .

		Mr.
Lew	PERSON	- isham , for instance , read his
Butler	PERSON	's `` Anal - ogy '' and some other books , had doubts , and called upon God for ' ' Faith ' ' in the silence of the
night	TIME	, `` Faith to be delivered immedi - ately if Mr.
Lewisham	PERSON	's patronage was valued , and which nevertheless was not so deliv - ered . ''

		Mr.
Lewisham	PERSON	was an early figure , but his followers had equally slight expe - riences , which is perhaps rather like life .

		One would not expect in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's think - ing to find much consideration of traditional religion .

		We do , however , curiously enough , have something slightly of the sort : in `` The World Set Free '' is an interesting quotation from the general memorandum to teachers which was ' ' the keynote of the modern educa - tional system . ''

		It begins with the familiar words , ' ' Whosoever will save his life shall lose it , '' and ends with this singular sentence : `` Philosophy , discovery , art , every sort of skill , every sort of service , love , these are the means of salvation from that narrow loneli - ness of desire , that brooding preoccupation with self and egotistical relationships , which is hell for the individual , treason to the race , and exile from God . ''

		These last words must come to many readers of the book with some astonishment as the first appearance of God on the scene .

		He is not otherwise mentioned , except once , and that in connection with the past .

		Yet it would appear that He was some - how in the minds of the world-managers .

		There is another interesting matter which seems to bear on this point . ' '

		The World Set Free '' ends with a fine account of the last days of
Karenin	ORGANIZATION	, the great educational genius and organizer whose words have just been quoted .

		He was incurably crippled and de - formed and had to undergo an operation which killed him .

		As he talks with the direc - tors and doctors and nurses in the great hos - pital in the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, he asks whether he could not be patched up somehow so as to last a bit longer .

		But that is not possible .

		`` I suppose , '' says he , `` the time is not far off when such bodies will no longer be born into the world . ' '

		`` You see , '' says the Doctor , `` it is neces - sary that spirits such as yours should be born into the world . ' '

		The spirit of
Karenin	ORGANIZATION	, what could that have been ?

		Was it merely his wonderful see - ing and organizing mind ?

		He said himself that science was `` the awakening mind of the race '' ; would he have said `` the awakening spirit of the race , '' or would that have been something different ?

		Surely we gather that there was something more to
Karenin	PERSON	than his remarkable mind , something more to his life and art than his remarkable penetration and organization .

		There certainly seems the implication of something which was perhaps in mind when
Karenin	PERSON	wrote of being ' ' exiled from God . ''

		But just what that something 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	was Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does not say nor does it have much to do with his ideas on a world-state .

		Such things seem worth noting about Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and his thinking .

		You may wonder why , if one disagree with him on such funda - mental matters , one thinks it worth while to read his books or to write of them .

		But few would ask such a question who have felt the fascination of any great writer , or , we might say , of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	in particular .

		As one reads his books , whether agreeing with his ideas or not and generally one can not fully agree with him one is carried along by the inter - est and suggestion of there being so many ideas , or even of any ideas at all .

		It is not so much that he `` makes one think '' according to the stock phrase , but that he suggests so much that is different from one 's ordinary way of looking at things and yet so plausible , that one is constantly agreeing and disagreeing and always in a state where one wants to talk either to him or about him .

		Yet in addition to all this , it may be said that even though facts have not substantiated some of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's ante-bellum ideas , and though our fundamental conceptions may pre - vent our accepting all his ideas for recon - struction , yet it is something to find one who has definite ideas about reconstruction .

		We may at least agree with him in the idea that there ought to be some sort of reconstruction after the madness of the moment has come to an end and men 's minds may undertake some better scheme of things .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		BY WAY OF PARENTHESIS let a f ew tentative observations here be offered on a minor ques - tion of literary style .

		Some writers there are who never fail to unfold their thought in so logical and natural and altogether convincing a manner that the reader has a delightful sense of being lifted and carried , without jolt or jar , to a predestined goal .

		No sudden halts for repairs , no spasmodic sprints to make up the time lost in such halts , no time-wasting zig-zag side-trips on the way , rack the pas - senger 's nerves and fret his soul .

		Of this sure and steady gait are such prose masters as
Johnson	PERSON	and
Macaulay	PERSON	, to read whom is a rest and a relief from the chaos of one 's own less strictly disciplined mental processes .

		Others there are , of a quite different habit , whose mode of progression , if not exactly that of the `` razzle-dazzle , '' familiar to sea-side pleasure - seekers , yet bears some resemblance to the meanderings of the `` roller-coaster '' track .

		Mazes and involutions , doublings and turn - ings , lingerings and loiterings and wide cir - cumambulations , are dear to this order of writers , and the elaborate pattern traced by the pen of a master in this labyrinthine style moves to ecstasies of admiration and despair .

		In this category belong , preeminently ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		Each of these two so opposite manners has , of course , the defects of its qualities , and each may win from an impartial reader an equal degree of ap - proval , or of disapproval .

		One test of style as a sure and effective vehicle of thought is found in its suitability or unsuitability for oral recital .

		Many a person in the habit of reading aloud to others must have noted the ease and satisfaction with which certain authors may be thus interpreted to the listening ear , while others , equally or even more richly gifted , are an irritation and a torture to both him who reads and him who listens .

		Excessive use of the parenthesis is a not uncommon hindrance to ready recitability ; and it is not a rash assertion that the woman writer is more given than the man to this parenthetical style , this habit of catching at the first thought or image that presents itself , and then breaking off for a moment , sometimes a long moment , to make a place for omissions , or , so to speak , to pick up the dropped stitches , before completing the sentence .

		This rather awkward procedure might be likened to the headlong haste of a boy who , in dressing , inadvertently snatches up his coat and begins to put it on before donning his vest , and then , perceiving his error , holds his coat in suspension with his teeth while wriggling into his vest , after which exhibition of misapplied energy he succeeds in adjusting the other garment .

		`` SHAKESPEARE EVERY DAY / ' the motto of the
Henry Jewett Players	ORGANIZATION	at the
Boston Opera House	ORGANIZATION	, evidently assumes that the greatest of the world 's dramatic poets is not too bright or good for human nature 's daily food ; and that this is no rash assumption one would fain be - lieve , as in fact one is encouraged to believe by the report that the production , since the begin - ning of the year , of the five plays , `` As You Like It , '' `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' `` The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	, '' ``
Julius Cassar	PERSON	, '' and `` Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' has met with `` the hearty approval of the press and the enthusi - astic support of the public . ''

		Here would seem to be gratifying proof , if proof were needed , that the great mass of wholesome , hearty , unaffected , workaday people really prefer good drama to worthless if they are but
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 251 allowed a choice .

		For the purposes of ade - quate and not too costly presentation of a rather long list of Shakespeare plays , a good stock company like the above-named , striving to attain and maintain `` balance , smoothness , coordination , and careful detail , '' is likely in the long run to produce better results , both on the stage and in the box-office , than can be expected of a single star indifferently sup - ported .

		Like Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	in his praiseworthy endeavors to provide the
New York	LOCATION	public with something better than the theatres have hitherto been offering , the
Jewett Players	ORGANIZATION	, if their prospectus speaks truly , are striving to confer upon
Boston	LOCATION	a benefit of no mean sort .

		With the innumera - ble moving-picture houses and other cheap resorts as rivals in the amusement field , the management still hopes to win the increasing favor of the great public .

		Here is the beatific vision that inspires the movement : `` The ideal toward which the management is con - stantly looking is the establishment of a per - manent repertory theatre in
Boston	LOCATION	, a theatre for all the people who love the drama , and not merely for habitual playgoers .

		... To pro- vide the best in drama , presented by the best players obtainable , in the most beautiful play - house in
America	LOCATION	, and at the most reasonable of ' popular ' prices : this is the means whereby the management hopes to bring about that long-cherished dream of a theatre that shall be to
Boston	LOCATION	much the sort of institutional influence that the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	is to
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		A GET-RICH-QUICK CULTURE naturally has its attractions for many in this stirring age and generation ; but it was this sort of crude cul - ture , or pseudo-culture , that received a sharp rap of condemnation from the president of
Hamilton College	ORGANIZATION	at a recent teachers ' confer - ence held at the seat of that institution of learning .

		Urging a rally to the cause of the classics , and deprecating the increasing ten - dency to short-cuts through school and college , the speaker said : `` If this practical and mer - cenary attitude continues , not only will the classics disappear from our curricula , but higher mathematics and the more advanced work in literature will also go . ''

		How much more than mere `` polite literature '' may be meant by a broadly based classical culture was long ago made clear by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in reply to some of
Huxley	LOCATION	's depreciatory re - marks on
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's educational ideals .

		The scientist had averred that his distinguished contemporary referred only to belles lettres when he spoke of the need of knowing the best that has been thought and said by the modern nations ; to which
Arnold	PERSON	replied in one of his American lectures -LRB- that on `` Literature and Science '' -RRB- : `` But as I do not mean , by know - ing ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, knowing merely more or less of Latin belles lettres , and taking no ac - count of
Rome	LOCATION	's military , and political , and legal , and administrative work in the world ; and as , by knowing ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, I under - stand knowing her as the giver of Greek art , and the guide to a free and right use of reason and to scientific method , and the founder of our mathematics and physics and astronomy and biology , I understand knowing her as all this , and not merely knowing certain Greek poems , and histories , and treatises , and speeches , so as to the knowledge of modern nations also .

		By knowing modern nations , I mean not merely knowing their belles lettres , but knowing also what has been done by such men as
Copernicus	LOCATION	,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Newton	LOCATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	. ''

		It is safe to say that no system of get-rich - quick culture will give the world either any Arnolds or any Huxleys .

		A FOLLOWER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF
CLARK RUSSELL	PERSON	, like him going to sea at a tender age , but continuing much longer this life on the ocean wave , like him turning to later literary account his salt-water experiences , though with somewhat less abundant productivity , and like him enjoying in his lifetime a gratify - ing degree of popular success , the late
Frank Thomas Bullen	PERSON	-LRB- he died last month at
Madeira	LOCATION	-RRB- might well be called , so far as there is any meaning in the term , a self-made author .

		Born in
London	LOCATION
April 5 , 1857	DATE	, he received no school education after nine years of age , when he became an errand boy and began to make his own way in the world .

		At seventeen he turned sailor , and for fourteen years he was a sea-rover , visiting all parts of the world and rising to the position of chief mate , after which he accepted a junior clerkship in the
Meteoro	LOCATION	- logical Office , where he remained until
1890	DATE	, making meanwhile occasional and not unsuc - cessful trial of his pen as a story-teller .

		In - deed , such encouragement did he receive from editors and readers of these tales of the sea that he decided to devote himself unreservedly to their composition .

		His whaling story , ' ' The Cruise of the ` Cachalot , ' '' in emulation of the work of a greater than he , the gifted author of `` Moby
Dick	PERSON	, '' is perhaps the best-known as it is among the most readable of his numerous romances of sea-faring , which include , among others , `` A Whaleman 's Wife , '' `` Cut off from the World , '' `` Creatures of the Sea , '' `` A Son of the Sea , '' and `` Sea - wrack . ''

		Somewhat different from these , and yet begot - ten of the same sort of activity and observa - 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	tion , are his `` religious autobiography , '' `` With Christ at Sea , '' and his book entitled ' ' Sea Puritans . ' '

		Though not a
Herman Mel	PERSON	- ville or a
Clark Russell	PERSON	or , still less , a
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	,
Bullen	PERSON	had won for himself an inti - mate knowledge of things maritime , and he wrote from the fulness of personal experience .

		Significant of his industry as a writer is the brief entry under the head of recreations in ' ' Who 's Who . ' '

		One word sufficed , ' ' none . ' '

		A FAMOUS POLITICAL PAMPHLET , ' ' The Fight in
Dame Europa	LOCATION	's School , '' with appropriate and amusing illustrations by
Thomas Nast	PERSON	, who was just beginning to achieve fame when the pamphlet was written , will bear a re - reading at this time , if one is so fortunate as to have access to a copy of the forty-four - year-old publication or any later reproduction of it .

		The satirical author begins in the fol - lowing pleasant vein , as some older readers may remember : `` Mrs.
Europa	PERSON	kept a dame school , where boys were well instructed in modern languages , fortification , and the use of the globes .

		Her connection and credit were good , for there was no other school where so sound and liberal an education could be ob - tained ... These lads at Mrs.
Europa	PERSON	's were of all sorts and sizes good boys and bad boys , sharp boys and slow boys , industrious boys and idle boys , peaceable boys and pugna - cious boys , well-behaved boys and vulgar boys ; and of course the good old dame could not manage them all .

		So , as she did not like the masters to be prying about the playground out of school , she chose from among the biggest and most trustworthy of her pupils five moni - tors , who had authority over the rest of the boys , and kept the unruly ones in order .

		These five , at the time of which we are writing , were
Louis	LOCATION	,
William	LOCATION	,
Aleck	LOCATION	,
Joseph	PERSON	, and
John	PERSON	. ''

		Then follows , of course , the story of the fierce quarrel between
Louis	PERSON	and
William	PERSON	, with the awkward part played by the other monitors in their attempts to preserve a digni - fied neutrality ; and it is
John	PERSON	's conduct that receives the satirist 's sharpest stabs .

		Among the innumerable printed products that owe their origin to the present war , a new `` Dame Europa 's School , '' modelled after the old , was sure to find a place .

		NEW BOOKS FOR OLD might sound like a good bargain to an unwary Princess Badroulbou - dour , but if the Aladdin in the case were any - thing of a bibliophile he would not thank his fair spouse for lending an ear to the specious offers of the book-peddling magician .

		In the latest report of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	, the Director , announces the acquisi - tion of three hundred thousand `` pieces '' -LRB- presumably books , pamphlets , manuscripts , etc. -RRB- in partial replacement of the valuable collection destroyed by fire two years before .

		Yet he asserts that these considerable acces - sions `` do not remotely approach three-fifths of the gross value and effectiveness of the 500,000 pieces burned . ''

		And he continues : `` There are two chief reasons for this : the increased cost of books and the impossibility of reproducing by a tour de force the costly organization and bibliographic apparatus for administration which was established in the old library .

		Not only have currently pub - lished books shared substantially in that in - creased cost which has marked luxuries as well as necessaries during the past ten or fifteen years , but older books , those outside the trade and technically known as ' out of print , ' espe - cially of certain kinds , have multiplied in value often many hundred fold . ''

		Both the spread of public libraries and the increase in the number of wealthy private collectors have contributed to raise the price of out-of-print books .

		The multimillionaire collector is a for - midable competitor for even the richest library to bid against , and the only possible course in such circumstances is usually for the library to possess its purse in patience and wait for the multimillionaire 's inevitable relinquish - ment of his treasures in the course of nature , when they may be again thrown on the mar - ket or perhaps bequeathed to the very library most desirous of obtaining them .

		In the book world all things have a tendency to come to him who waits .

		AN EDITOR WITH AN IDEAL that he succeeds to a notable degree in realizing is in one sense a creative author , and so deserves something of the honor paid to gifted authorship .

		This , of course , presupposes that the ideal is con - siderably higher than that symbolized by the letter S crossed by two perpendicular lines .

		Of this high quality was the standard set for himself by the late
Samuel Bowles	PERSON	, fourth of that name and third in successive editorship of the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republican . ''

		Though he was , by genius and training , much more of a business manager than a man of letters , yet he was heir to the journalistic traditions of his father and grandfather , and succeeded in perpetuating those traditions as embodied in the newspaper founded ninety-one years ago .

		As his father before him had added the daily to the weekly issue of the journal , so he ex - tended its field by creating the
Sunday	DATE	`` Republican , '' perhaps the best , the most respectable , the most worthy of a careful read - ing from beginning to end , of all our
Sunday 1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 253 journals .

		Some of the minor peculiarities of the `` Republican '' have acquired a fame al - most as wide as its reputation , for literary excellence and general sanity .

		Its scholarly restraint in the use of capitals is commend - able , even though carried to some excess .

		Its slight leanings toward spelling-reform are chiefly praiseworthy in that they go no fur - ther .

		Mr.
Bowles	PERSON	, who was in his sixty-fourth year when he died -LRB-
March 14	DATE	-RRB- , seems to be succeeded by no
Samuel Bowles	PERSON	the fifth , in the control of his paper , though he does leave a son of that name in journalism in another city ; yet it is to be hoped and confidently expected that the standard of the `` Repub - lican '' will suffer no depression from his death .

		THE BOUNDLESSNESS OF THE FIELD OF AU - THORSHIP is now and then brought forcibly to one 's realization .

		Unsuspected domains of literary activity reveal themselves upon glanc - ing however cursorily over the catalogue of almost any considerable collection of books .

		A list of bibliographies , dry in itself as the proverbial `` remainder biscuit after a voy - age , '' is nevertheless a good eye-opener to the vastness of the world of things written about .

		This splendid spaciousness of the literary realm ' ' literary ' ' is here used in its largest sense was brought home to us not long ago by the appearance of a `` Bibliography of Bibliographies , '' and is now again made in some sort apprehensible to the intelligence by a perusal of the latest report of that triply based institution whose foundations were laid by
John Jacob Astor	PERSON	,
James Lenox	PERSON	, and
Sam	PERSON	- uel
J. Tilden	PERSON	.

		For instance , it appears that in the
Technology Division	ORGANIZATION	of that library there was recently compiled and published a list of works on oxy-acetylene welding , and even in so limited and specialized a branch of technical study there were enough treatises to furnish a catalogue thirty-four pages in length .

		It is small wonder that the special libraries , whereof so little was heard and so small account was made in our youth , have now their proper organization and are fast growing in number and importance .

		A NEW VARIETY OF THE JOURNALIST 'S ART appeals for recognition in the world of letters ; it is to be known as rural journalism , and its mysteries will be taught , appropriately enough , at the agricultural college .

		The trus - tees of the school of farming at
Amherst	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- have voted to establish a `` major '' course in this latest branch of journalism , un - der the direction of Professor
Robert `` W. Neal	PERSON	, who has urged the innovation on the ground of `` the extreme importance of the farm jour - nal and the country newspaper to country life . ''

		Agricultural schools , it is argued , in order to treat effectively the subject of farm - ing in all its phases and ramifications , have found it necessary to concern themselves with the economic and social interests of country life .

		Hence the attention they pay to the churches and schools as important factors in rural affairs ; and hence , too , their recognition of the newspaper as a powerful influence in the life and work of the farming community .

		In all this the man of letters will be disposed to see an acknowledgment that the pen is mightier than the plough .

		A PLEASING PROSPECT IN BIOGRAPHY Opens before us in the announcement of two forth - coming books on that brilliant author and many-sided , lovable , and always interesting man , the late Father
Hugh Benson	PERSON	, recently cut off in the early prime of his remarkable pow r ers .

		The more full and formal biography will be that prepared by
Benson	PERSON	's friend ,
Father Martindale	PERSON	, who , a brilliant man him - self , is said to have understood his brilliant associate as well as to have loved him .

		There will also be the less elaborate but probably more touching tribute from the elder brother , Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	, under the title , `` Hugh : The Memoir of a Brother . ''

		From such passages of biographical reminis - cence as have already come from his pen as in `` The Leaves of the Tree '' and in several of his volumes of miscellaneous essays one may safely assume that the promised fraternal sketch will be likely to take its place among the books that are not soon allowed to perish from memory .

		COMMUNICATION .

		A WOED OF EXPLANATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
March 4	DATE	the statement is made that '' a branch of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	was wiped out by fire . ''

		Although technically cor - rect , this statement is , I fear , apt to be misleading .

		The fire was that which destroyed the
Missouri	LOCATION	Building at the
St. Louis World	LOCATION	's Fair .

		In this building among other things was an exhibit of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, which was operated as a temporary branch of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The building , like most of those at world 's fairs , was of light temporary construction , and therefore easily burned .

		Our regular branches are all of fire-proof construction .

		254 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	FROM CANOE TO AEROPLANE IN
AMERICAN TRAVEL	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In no field of invention is the cumulative rapidity of progress more impressive than in the development of modern means of travel .

		Truism though it be that every fresh discovery of science makes possible a hundred additional discoveries and inventions , so that the rate of advance is represented by a geometrical pro- gression having a very large constant factor , the marvel of modern scientific and industrial progress never loses its power to impress and fairly to daze the imagination .

		Even the crudest conjecture of what astounding results may be possible to applied science in a single decade or half-decade of the twenty-first century , if already that brief space of time suffices for achievements exceeding the total of accomplishment witnessed by entire centuries , is enough to take away the breath .

		Confining himself to that department of applied science which has to do with the means of locomotion , and also limiting his researches to our own country and , in the main , to the century end - ing with the completion of the first transcon - tinental railway , Mr.
Seymour Dunbar	PERSON	has nevertheless found ample material , both docu - mentary and illustrative , for the filling of a four-volume work which is thus comprehen - sively designated on the title-page : `` A His - tory of Travel in
America	LOCATION	.

		Showing the
Development of Travel and Transportation	ORGANIZATION	from the Crude Methods of the Canoe and the Dog-Sled to the Highly Organized Railway Systems of the Present , Together with a
Nar	ORGANIZATION	- rative of the Human Experiences and
Chang	PERSON	- ing Social Conditions that Accompanied this Economic Conquest of the Continent . ''

		It is elaborately equipped `` with maps and other illustrations reproduced from early engrav - ings , original contemporaneous drawings and broadsides . ''

		A final chapter gives a `` sum - mary of present conditions '' and briefly fore - shadows the wonders to come , including of course the still unimagined developments of aerial navigation .

		Then follow a hundred pages of appended matter , historical and sta - tistical , and an elaborate fifty-page index , the whole work attaining the rather formidable proportions of
1529	DATE	pages .

		So impressive a monument to a single person 's industry and scholarship can not fail to command admira - tion .

		With all the books on historic highways and * A HISTORY OF TRAVEL IN

		waterways and famous trails that our histo - rians and descriptive writers have of late pro- duced , much of the present work will be more or less familiar to many readers ; but its point of view , most of its details , and not a few of its illustrations , will probably be found to pos - sess a pleasing novelty , and their manner of presentation , by which is meant , not least of all , the sumptuous appearance of these well - made volumes , will not fail to attract .

		In his attitude toward his subject the author natu - rally and properly fails not , throughout , to uphold the dignity and importance and far - reaching significance of his theme .

		Modes of moving from place to place he considers indica - tive of the degree of development attained by the people using them ; and a well-developed vehicular traffic is of course a potent instru - ment for the material and intellectual improve - ment of the society in which it is found .

		This philosophy of the matter , however pleasing and satisfying to the author and his readers , has nevertheless its weak points .

		If a people 's method of travel is to serve as a criterion of its general enlightenment and progress , the Greeks of the time of Pericles ought to be accounted as little better than barbarians , and the subjects of
King Cheops	LOCATION	, notwithstanding the testimony of the Pyramids , could hardly be said to have emerged from savagery .

		But , granting the soundness of the author 's theory in the main , let us allow him to set forth in his own words something of the plan and purpose of his work .

		In his opening chapter he says : '' The subject to which these pages are devoted is the foundation whereon the country , considered as a social and industrial organization , has been built .

		A few years ago until as late a date as 1806 the six or seven million people of
America	LOCATION	were contentedly visiting their friends , or moving about on business , in flatboats , dog-sleds , stage - coaches , strange wagons or canoes .

		Those were the only vehicles of travel , and when they were not available , as was very often the case , the traveller walked or else rode upon a horse .

		To go from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seacoast to such remote regions as Cin - cinnati or
St. Louis	LOCATION	or
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	now Chi - cago in those days meant a journey of many weary weeks , with possibly the loss of a scalp .

		Such a thing as a trip across the continent and back was not within the range of thought of the ordinary man .

		... In this present realm of four - day ocean steamships , of trains that dive beneath rivers or plunge through a thousand miles in twenty hours , of subways , motor-cars , submarine boats , and with the flying machine just beginning to dot the sky , we are privileged to remember , if we choose , that once upon a time the express boats on the canals maintained a speed of three miles an hour for day after day , and that the Pioneer Fast Line advertised it would rush its passengers through from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	in four days and often nearly kept its word . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 255 In its wealth of contents , the book first sur - veys the general condition and appearance of our country in its infancy , pointing out the all but insuperable difficulties of travel through the dense forests , and giving some account of the early Indian trails ; then traces the gradual growth of improved means of com - munication as influenced and accelerated by the condition and needs of the people , and argues that it was universal transportation facilities , rather than politics or war , that acted as the compelling force for real national unity ; brings forward much new material in illustration of social conditions and modes of travel in the middle and far `` West , with glimpses of pioneer life and details concerning the government 's dealings with our native tribes ; and , in its later chapters , exhibits the on-rush of our population into the vast west - ern domain made at last accessible to all by the road of iron .

		With a `` summary of present conditions , '' as already stated , the fascinating narrative comes to a close .

		As a sample of its quality , a passage describing the old-fashioned tavern breakfast will here serve as well as another : '' Then came the breakfast ceremonial .

		The host marched to the front door , lifted a cow 's horn to his lips and sent forth the resounding blast that summoned all hands to the table .

		Some landlords preferred a big bell rather than a horn , and filled the air with a clangor heard for a mile around .

		A meal at one of the early taverns was nearly always a bountiful repast , and usually ended , whether at breakfast , dinner or supper , with two or more kinds of pie .

		Everything was put on the big table at once , and everybody ate until he reluctantly made up his mind to stop .

		In those days a meal meant all a man wanted to eat .

		The price re - mained the same .

		A slice of bread was visible even when the edge of it was held toward the eye .

		the butter could be safely attributed to the cow , and a third cup of tea or glass of milk was as smilingly produced , if called for , as the first .

		In short , the deplorable deficiency in varieties of knives and forks , and in different species of spoons as measured by modern requirements was made up by a plenitude of things that could be eaten instead of looked at . ''

		The beginning of certain reprehensible practices in railroad finance that are now only too well known to us of a later generation is traced back to about the middle of last cen - tury , or , more definitely , to the year
1848	DATE	, and is thus noticed by the author in connection with the general railway development of the period : '' At about this time , however , there likewise appeared the first outwai 'd symptoms of an un - fortunate condition that was destined to become much more prominent as the years went on , and that has injuriously affected the railway system of the country since the period mentioned .

		Although the people as a whole had cast out their mania and viewed the subjects of railroad construction and administration with saner eyes , a small but influ - ential portion of the population did not follow their example .

		Those avaricious men who repre - sented , in the economic and political affairs of their day .

		the influences which these later times have come to define as ' predatory wealth ' and ' special privilege , ' were beginning to recognize the opportunities that would lie within their grasp if they could control so vital a portion ` of the nation 's ; industrial fabric as the railways were obviously destined to become .

		They caught glimpses of the power that would be theirs if they built , operated and manipulated railways as gigantic weapons , rather than as agencies of public benefit which would methodically aid in the creation of new wealth through the operation of those processes they were primarily designed to perform .

		To characters so warped , and to able minds so inclined , the lure was irresistible and the result was sure .

		Thus began the extensive practice of building rail - ways with the object of acquiring money through their construction rather than by their later efficient operation . ''

		Then is described in outline the nefarious scheme w r hereby , with occasional differences in detail but with a wearisome sameness in essen - tial rascality , the too-trusting investor of the
last half-century	DATE	or more has been plundered by the unprincipled and avaricious railroad - promoter and railroad-wrecker .

		A noteworthy chapter of the concluding volume is devoted to the history of the great Mormon overland pilgrimage of 1846-8 , re - lating the events that led up to it , the expul - sion of the Church of Latter-day Saints from
Nauvoo	LOCATION	, the sufferings of the migrating party , the discovery of the
Great Salt Lake Valley	LOCATION	, and the final settlement of the wandering host in the new land of promise after two and a half years of vagrancy .

		Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	has spared no pains to make his book all that the promise of its title-page leads one to expect .

		His diligence is beyond praise , his range of research amazing .

		Libraries and historical societies , antiquaries and special authorities , have been called upon , not in vain , to swell the riches and perfect the historical accuracy of his stately volumes .

		If a reviewer were to presume , from the lesser resources of his own equipment , to offer any general criti - cism as he closes with hearty commendation this absorbing story of a great movement in American civilization , it would perhaps take the form of a regret that the greatness of the theme is not always matched by an equal greatness of style in the writer .

		A certain unfailing niceness in the choice of words , a true sense of the literary possibilities and im - possibilities of a subject or a situation , a 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	scholarly avoidance of excesses of any sort , are not among the outstanding merits of the author 's style as displayed in this book .

		He makes , too , the rather frequent mistake of crediting his readers with too little rather than too much intelligence .

		On one page , for in - stance , he takes the trouble to explain what a railway `` turnout '' is , and at the foot of another he thinks it necessary to add a note to the effect that ' ' a public house was also called an ordinary .

		* ' Probably it is better , all things considered , to overestimate than to underesti - mate a reader 's mental equipment ; at any rate , it is a Coleridgian axiom that an uneluci - dated obscurity is a compliment to the reader 's acuteness .

		Four hundred illustrations , colored and un - colored , with two folding maps , add no little to the book 's attractiveness and interest .

		The quality of its typography and press-work is in accord with the other excellences of the work .

		PERCY F. BICKNELU THE ARCH-PRIEST OF GERMAN IMPERIALISM .

		* One of the `` literary '' results of the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean war has been the resuscitation of a group of writers of German birth or affiliations who had been largely forgotten or who were formerly known only to a small number of scholars .

		Among these may be mentioned the military writers ,
Clausewitz	PERSON	and
Bernhardi	PERSON	, the philosopher
Nietzsche	PERSON	, and the historian Treitschke .

		This result has been the work chiefly of Englishmen who believe they have found in the teachings of these writers all the abominable doctrines of imperialism , mili - tarism , the supremacy of force , the blind idolatry of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and other ideas of the kind which now reign in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Treitschke 's \ vritings in particular have been translated , edited , and republished in numerous editions , and are now being widely read by the English and American public .

		Three of the most recent of these publications are Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	's `` Treitschke and the Great War , '' Mr.
H. W. C. Davis	PERSON	's `` The Political Thought of
Heinrich von Treitschke	PERSON	, ' ' and the collection of translated essays entitled ``

		contribution ; but unfortunately it is marred by evidences of strong prejudice and at times of unfairness .

		The work of Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is less a commentary or analysis , and more of a collection of ex - tracts from
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's historical and po - litical writings , especially his Politik , which consists of two volumes of lectures delivered at
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Happily , there is here less evidence of bias than in the first mentioned work .

		For this and other reasons it is a more trustworthy and useful book for English and American students of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's political philosophy .

		The third book is a collection of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's essays dealing with questions of German for - eign politics .

		They are unaccompanied by any comment or criticism except a brief prefa - tory analysis by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	.

		They include papers on German relations with other powers .

		Turkey and the great nations ,
Germany	LOCATION	and the oriental question , what
Germany	LOCATION	demands of
France	LOCATION	, the German Empire , and other essays .

		The ideas which run through them all are characteristic of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's political thought : the doctrine of imperialism ,
Germany	LOCATION	's mission as a world power , the rule of force , etc. .

		Treitschke 's was a unique personality in many respects .

		He was a Saxon by birth , but of Czech ancestry .

		His father was a general in the army , and the son would doubtless have chosen a military career had an accident not deprived him of his hearing .

		He studied and taught in various German universities , but in
1874	DATE	he was called to the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	, where he remained until his death in
1896	DATE	.

		He was distinguished by his historical scholar - ship and his eloquence as a lecturer , and prob - ably no German professor ever lectured to larger audiences or more completely capti - vated his hearers .

		He started out as a liberal , but after his removal to
Berlin	LOCATION	he became an ultra-conservative and an ardent supporter of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, an enemy to the Social Democrats , and a glorifier of the Hohenzollern dynasty .

		He became a member of the Reichstag in
1871	DATE	, where he sat continuously until
1888	DATE	, when he resigned largely out of disgust because of the increasing influence of the Social Demo - crats .

		His political philosophy may be summed up in the following ideas : The essence of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is power , and it is to be found in a well - equipped and well-drilled army ; it is not a mere academy of arts or sciences .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	belies its own nature when it neglects the army , therefore the organization of the army is one of the first constitutional questions for the consideration of the
State	ORGANIZATION	; the army is
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 257 the foundation of political freedom , so that we need not waste pity on states that have a powerful and well-drilled army .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	exists over and apart from the individuals who compose it ; and it is entitled to their utmost sacrifices , in short , they exist for it rather than the
State	ORGANIZATION	for them .

		Treitschke has been much reproached for his views regarding the binding force of treaties ; and the responsibility for the `` scrap of paper '' theory of which we have heard so much lately is attributed to him .

		His views upon this point are substantially as follows :
The State	ORGANIZATION	is subject to no human superior ; any restrictions upon its sovereignty are mere voluntary and self-imposed limitations ; all treaty obligations are subject to the rule of rebus sic stantibus , and therefore treaties which have outlived their usefulness may be denounced and replaced by new ones which correspond to the new conditions .


Every State	ORGANIZATION	, therefore , is the final judge of its obli - gations , and the duty of self-preservation may require it to repudiate treaties which are in - consistent with its own progress and existence .

		There is no reputable writer on international law to-day who would contest the soundness of this view ; yet
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's disciples have employed his doctrine of rebus sic stantibus in a sense which he apparently did not intend it to be understood , and his critics have like - wise attributed to him the responsibility for , the view , now apparently held by some Ger - mans , that treaties may be denounced and rejected upon mere grounds of inconvenience .

		The deification of war runs through the whole of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's historical and political writings .

		Again and again he speaks of the `` moral majesty , '' the `` moral grandeur , '' and the `` moral sublimity '' of war .

		In his Politik he says : `` War is political science par ex - cellence .

		Over .

		and over again has it been proved that it is only in war that a people becomes indeed a people .

		It is only in the common performance of heroic deeds for the sake of the Fatherland that a nation becomes truly and spiritually united . ''

		`` The second important function of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' we are told , `` is warfare .

		That men have so long refused to recognize this fact proves how emasculated political science has become in the hands of civilians . ''

		`` If it had not been for war , there would be no States .

		It is to war that all the States we know of owe their existence .

		The protection of its citizens by strength of arms is the first and foremost duty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Therefore wars must continue to the end of history as long as there is a plurality of States .

		Neither logic nor human nature re - veal any probability that it could ever be otherwise .

		The blind votaries of perpetual peace fall into error of either mentally iso - lating the individual
State	ORGANIZATION	, or else of imag - ining a World-State , which we have already shown to be an absurdity . ''

		Again he says : ' ' Any one with a knowledge of history realises that to expel war from the universe would be to mutilate human nature .

		There can be no freedom unless there can be a warlike force , prepared to sacrifice itself for freedom .

		We must repeat that scholars , in con - sidering this question , are apt to argue from the quiet assumption that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is merely intended to be an Academy of the Fine Arts and Sciences .

		That is one of its functions , but not the most important .

		If a
State	ORGANIZATION	neglects its physical in favor of its intellectual energies , it falls into decay . ' '

		Time and again he dwells upon the glories of war , the duty of men to sacrifice not only their lives but the `` natural and deep-rooted feelings of the human soul for a great patri - otic idea , '' the impossibility of liberty without war , and the self - stultification of those who think that warfare can be eliminated from the world .

		War is the only remedy for sick na - tions ; without war all progress will disappear from history ; it has always been the ex - hausted , spiritless , enervated ages that have played with the dream of universal peace .

		Treitschke had no admiration for
England	LOCATION	or the English .

		On the contrary , his feeling toward them was largely one of contempt .

		More than any one else , he is held responsible by the English for the anti-English sentiment which blazed out during the Boer War , and which has since reigned in German society and in the press .

		For this reason English historians and editors of his writings have not always interpreted his political theories fairly or correctly .

		Finally , it may be seriously doubted whether
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's teachings have ever exerted any - thing like the influence on the thought and life of the German people that the English now attribute to them .

		He was primarily a uni - versity professor ; and while he lectured to large audiences of students , the number of persons who were directly affected by his doc - trines was probably comparatively small .

		At the time , his views , now so much detested by Englishmen , attracted little attention ; and had it not been for the present war they would have remained unknown to the great mass of mankind .

		* The stream of
Browning	PERSON	books continues .

		If they were all of one type , that of uncritical praise and adulation , we might heartily wish the habit would die out ; but fortunately we have now and then a book or essay from one who is not altogether a Browningite , and who endeavors to see
Browning	PERSON	's work not through colored or distorting glasses but as it really is .

		Of such a character is Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	's volume on ``
Browning	PERSON	's Heroines , '' and we welcome it as on the whole a contribution of importance to the discussion of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's artistry .

		We must first say one or two things about the style of the book .

		It gives us constantly the impression of effort to be vivacious ; this it generally is , but , with its superabundance of short sentences , its rows of periods indi - cating omissions , its questions , it is also jerky and suggestive of a lack of poise .

		It is far from the simple , effective style which would carry far greater weight , and over which men have no monopoly .

		One specimen will suffice .

		The author is describing
Pippa	PERSON	's reflections at the close of her one day : `` But gradually the atmosphere of her mind seems restored ; the fogs of envy and curiosity begin to clear off she goes over the game of make-believe , how she was in turn each of the Pour ... but no !

		the miasma is still in the air , and she 's ' tired of fooling / and New Year 's Day is over , and ill or well , she must be content ... Even her lily 's asleep , but she will wake it up , and show it the friend she has plucked for it the flower she gathered as she passed the house on the hill ... Alas !

		even the flower seems infected .

		She compares it , ' this pampered thing , ' this double heartsease of the garden , with the wild growth , and once more Zanze comes to mind is n't she like the pampered blossom 1 ?

		And if there were a king of the flowers , ' and a girl-show held in his bowers , ' which would he like best , the Zanze or the
Pippa	LOCATION	?

		... -LSB- all these periods are in the text -RSB- .

		No ; nothing will conquer her dejection ; fancies will not do , awakening sleepy lilies will not do , '' etc. , etc. .

		This is of course indirect discourse ; but does it quite fit ?

		While the book is interesting , it can not be said that all parts are of equal value .

		In the case of some heroines no new point of view is presented ; the character is merely described as we are already familiar with her .

		This is true , for example , of much of what is said about
Pompilia	LOCATION	, about the
Countess Gismond	PERSON	, even about
Pippa	PERSON	.

		Was it worth while to go over the story of each of the poems at such length ?

		Except for a certain class of imma - ture or indolent readers , we doubt it .

New York	LOCATION	:
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		much of the book is taken up with the retelling of the stories , with copious though well chosen quotations .

		But other parts of the book are important .

		For example , we may take the treatment of
Mildred Tresham	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	thinks
Brown	PERSON	- ing did not understand her , and therefore did not succeed in his portrayal of her ; and Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	is right . ''

		What a girl he might have given us in
Mildred	LOCATION	, had he listened only to himself !

		But , not yet in full possession of that self , he set up as an ideal the ideal of others , trying dutifully to see it as they see it , denying dutifully his deepest instinct ; and , thus apostate , piled insincerity on insincerity , until at last no truth is anywhere , and we read on with growing alienation as each figure loses all of such reality as it ever had , and even
Gwendolen	PERSON	, the ' golden creature ' his own dauntless , indi - vidual woman , seeing and feeling truly through every fibre of her being is lost amid the fog . ''

		Likewise she is right in what she says of Pompilia : ''
Pompilia	PERSON	is a living soul , not a puppet of the theatre .

		Yet even here the same strange errors recur .

		She has words indeed that reach the inmost heart poignant , overpowering in tenderness and pathos ; but she has , also , words that cause the brows to draw together , the mind to pause un - easily , then to cry l Not so ! '

		Of such is the analysis of her own blank ignorance with regard to the marriage-state . ''

		Was the Lady of the Glove wrong ?

		Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	thinks so . ''

		And so the Lady thought right and did wrong : 't was not love set that task to humanity .

		Even
Browning	PERSON	can not win her our full pardon . ''

		Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	will not allow that the age was different from ours : '' Women 's hearts were the same ; and a woman 's heart , when it loves truly , will make no test for very pride-in-love 's dear sake .

		It scorns tests too much scorns them , it may be . ''

		But has she not already conceded that the age was different when she says above that for these great gifts `` the endless descriptions of death He would brave when my lip formed a breath , the lady `` must give in return her love , as love was understood at the court of
King Francis	LOCATION	'' ?

		Is it not true that love in its rela - tion to marriage was differently conceived in those days , and that we are not to judge of that age by standards which apply only -LRB- so far as we know -RCB- to our own ?

		In fact , is it not paradoxical to say that she thought right and did wrong ?

		If her act was the logical result of right thinking , how can it be maintained to have been a wrong act ?

		One remark which the author makes about Phene is , it seems to us .

		merely fanciful :
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 259 '' In this Passing of
Pippa	LOCATION	, silence and song have met and mingled into one another , for Phene is silence , as
Pippa	LOCATION	is song .

		Phene will speak more when
Jules	PERSON	and she are in their isle together but never will she speak much : she is silence . ''

		How do we know all this about Phene ?

		`` We never see her normal self in the poem .

		And when the author repeats , apparently with approval , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's comment , that having made
Pippa Monsignor	PERSON	's niece , ``
Browning	PERSON	might just as well have made
Sebald	ORGANIZATION	her long-lost brother , and Luigi a hus - band to whom she was secretly married , '' we must protest .

		Surely
Browning	PERSON	had the same right to represent Monsignor as
Pippa	LOCATION	's uncle that he had to cause the Happiest Four in Asolo to hear
Pippa	PERSON	's song at the precise mo - ment when it would influence each of them as it does ; and who are we that we should dis - pute him ?

		`` We suppose that the point at - tempted in the above quotation is that making Monsignor
Pippa	PERSON	's uncle renders the situation too melodramatic ; but even if one were to concede this , is melodrama necessarily un - truthful ?

		In that world of poetry of which , after all ,
Pippa	PERSON	is a denizen , we must take things as we find them .

		In spite of these adverse comments , how - ever , it is our opinion that the volume con - tains much that is good .

		Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	has read her
Browning	PERSON	carefully and with open eyes .

		Of her contention that
Browning	PERSON	has been in - jured by the blind worship of some of his followers there is no doubt .

		And her book will assuredly help to set forth the great poet in a truer light .

		is worth saying about this pitiful existence could be put in a single sketch .

		Fortunately , few authors err in such a choice of subject .

		Fortunately , also , in nearly every group of books two or three are found which distinctly advance the serious study of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's achievements , and do this without committing the blunder of being dull .

		The most recent examples of this latter type are Mr.
Edward Foord	PERSON	's `` Napoleon 's Russian Campaign of
1812	DATE	'' and
Colonel Vachee	ORGANIZATION	's `` Napoleon at Work , ' ' published in
Paris	LOCATION	a little over a year ago and now translated .

		Colonel Vachee had a definite pedagogical purpose in preparing his book .

		He desired to set forth in the person of the greatest of modern military leaders the characteristics of successful leadership .

		He had in mind the `` future wars '' in which
France	LOCATION	might be obliged to take a part , wars which within six months ceased to be future , and became tragically present .

		His method is not didactic but descriptive .

		He shows how
Napoleon	PERSON	reached his decisions , and the exact manner in which at every stage of the proceedings the execution of his plan was secured .

		This necessitates a careful description of the im - perial staff and of the functions of each prin - cipal officer .

		Colonel Vachee includes also two chapters upon
Napoleon	PERSON	's `` Rewards and Penalties , '' which were designed to secure the fidelity of soldiers as well as officers , and were suggested by a Machiavellian shrewdness .

		The last two chapters of the book deal with `` Na - poleon on the Battlefield . ''

		The material for this study is drawn from official records and correspondence , and from the recollections of those brought into intimate contact with Na - poleon during his campaigns .

		One of the most valuable witnesses is
Baron Fain	PERSON	, long
Napoleon	PERSON	's trusted private secretary .

		The secret of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's successes lay in
Colonel Vachee	ORGANIZATION	's opinion , not merely in his skill as a strategist , but chiefly in the energy and rapidity with which he drove his orders through to fulfilment .

		On a campaign he was accustomed to go to sleep at eight and to get up at twelve .

		The orders for the next day were drawn up and despatched between mid -
night and morning	TIME	.

		A single illustration will show how time , so vital in moving large bodies of troops , was saved .

		Two or three days be - fore the battle of
Jena	PERSON	, when his headquarters were at
Auma	LOCATION	, the orders sent to all six corps and the cavalry were despatched between three and four-thirty in the
morning	TIME	.

		The order to
Bernadotte	PERSON	, who was then eighteen miles away , was received in three hours and fifteen minutes .


Bernadotte	PERSON	's corps , of more than 20,000 men , was on the march within an hour 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	and three-quarters , and at the close of the day had marched seventeen miles .

		Napoleon 's camp was always an agitated scene .

		Neither his private secretaries nor his aids knew when they would be called upon for service , day or night .

		He would wake up suddenly and ask for his maps and his secre - taries .

		When the work was done , his next exclamation might be , `` The carriage ! ''

		or `` To horse ! ''

		Horses were kept saddled and bridled , and held by attendants .

		He had a campaign carriage , which could be driven in a few hours over the distance covered by the army in a day .

		On the night before a battle he usually reconnoitered the enemy 's position personally in order that his final directions to his generals might take account of the latest changes in the situation .

		At
Jena	PERSON	he was so venturesome that upon his return to his lines he was nearly shot by one of his own outposts .

		Colonel Vachee regards the organization of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's staff as defective .

		Indeed , it was so complex that even the lucid account of it in this volume leaves the mind of the reader sadly confused .

		The machinery for recording and transmitting orders seems to have been efficient , principally because it operated im - mediately under the eyes of the master and of
Berthier	PERSON	, his chief of staff .

		Napoleon was not accustomed to explain to his corps com - manders , even when a great battle was immi - nent , what his plan was .

		He did this to certain favorite generals , while to the others he gave specific orders , leaving them quite in the dark upon the general scheme .

		Sometimes the consequences of such a method were un - fortunate .

		This is the explanation , for ex - ample , of
Bernadotte	ORGANIZATION	's inaction on
October 14 , 1806	DATE	, taking part neither in the battle of
Jena	PERSON	nor going to the assistance of Davout in his struggle with the Prussians at Auerstadt .

		The most fatal consequences came when
Napoleon	PERSON	's own energy was diminished , and when this lack was not made up by the initiative of his subordinates .

		Two or three of the minor personages of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's staff are well described by
Colonel Vachee	ORGANIZATION	.

		One was D'Albe , the topographical secretary , who had served
Napoleon	PERSON	for seven - teen years .

		He would stick colored pins into the maps of the region to represent the exact position of the different corps , as this was indicated in the latest reports .

		The same would be done for the position of the enemy 's army , so far as it was known .

		In the night time the map was surrounded by twenty candles .

		If a despatch came , the conclusions from it were entered on the map ; and Na - poleon , compass in hand , would bend over it measuring the distances .

		Sometimes the map was so large that both
Napoleon	PERSON	and D'Albe would lie flat upon it , discussing the situations and distances .

		Occasionally in their excite - ment their heads came together violently .

		D '
Albe	PERSON	's knowledge was so indispensable that
Napoleon	PERSON	treated him more confidentially than any other officer in the army .

		He , if any one , knew what steps the master 's mind was fol - lowing in arriving at a plan of the decisive manoeuvre .

		Another confidential officer , D'Ideville , was both interpreter and statistician of foreign armies .

		Napoleon in military affairs as in civil administration was systematic in obtain - ing and recording useful information .

		The strength of foreign armies naturally interested him .

		His officers and even ambassadors and other diplomatic agents had orders to send to
Paris	LOCATION	every scrap of information about the strength , position , and movements of foreign , armies .

		All this was carefully sifted and sum - marized , so that
Napoleon	PERSON	often knew as much about foreign armies as about his own .

		On a campaign D'Ideville was always with him , and if a prisoner was brought in D'Ide - ville questioned him in his own language , and the information was classified with the rest .

		Napoleon occasionally amused himself in times of peace by telling ambassadors about movements of their armies of which they had not been advised and requesting an explana - tion .

		It is satisfactory to note that although
Colonel Vachee	ORGANIZATION	sees much to admire in Na - poleon as a military leader , he is not blind to
Napoleon	PERSON	's defects as a man and a statesman .

		Indeed , the selfishness of the Emperor , his egoism -LRB- to use the favorite word of French writers -RRB- , receives quite sufficient emphasis .

		It is a question whether the author does not overstep the limits of his task in stating how the baser imperial appetites were provided for through the solicitude of such distinguished panders as
Talleyrand	LOCATION	,
Berthier	PERSON	, Murat , and
Duroc	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Foord	PERSON	's volume shows how Napoleon in
1812	DATE	instead of organizing victory sent his greatest army to final defeat and ruin , mainly through failure to estimate adequately the climatic and geographical conditions of a cam - paign in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		His transport system broke down before the army reached
Vilna	LOCATION	, fifty miles from the frontier .

		For one thing , the wagons proved to be too heavy for the Polish roads , which were turned into a quagmire by five or six days of rain .

		In several of Na - poleon 's decisions during the campaign the author sees not merely natural miscalculation but a decline of that mental alertness and power of imagination which had accounted for
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 201 so many victorious campaigns .

		One of the most striking instances is the order given at
Orsha	LOCATION	on the retreat to destroy the reserve bridge train of sixty pontoons .

		Mr.
Foord	PERSON	says that
Baron Eble	PERSON	, chief of the bridge trains , `` alive to the danger , pressed to be allowed to keep fifteen pontoons , but in vain , and he could save only 2 field forges , 2 wag - gons of charcoal and 6 of implements . ''

		And this happened when the passage of the
Bere	PERSON	- zina was imminent .

		The special qualities of Mr.
Foord	PERSON	's treatment are his careful atten - tion to details of food , clothing , discipline , and morale at various stages of the campaign .

		He writes with full appreciation of Welling - ton 's dictum that an army `` moves on its belly , '' and if that is empty the fate of the army is sealed .

		The crowning disasters of the retreat he attributes to the lack of discipline , due in part to a month of pillage in
Moscow	LOCATION	and to the large number of non-combatants , including many women , by whom the army was accompanied .

		Equally illuminating is the author 's handling of the military prob - lems , the question of
Bagration	ORGANIZATION	's escape from
King Jerome	PERSON	, the fiasco of the Drissa camp , the refusal of Napoleon to put in the Imperial Guard at
Borodino	LOCATION	, and others .

		The handsome volume which is devoted to the vicissitudes of `` An Unknown Son of Na - poleon -LRB- Count Leon -RRB- '' comes very close in its early chapters to the bounds of pornographic literature .

		After it leaves the story of the father and mother and takes up that of the son , it deals with melodrama , often that which is on the edge of the gutter .

		Every folly of the son is , however , another blot on the memory of such a father .

		One must pro- test , furthermore , against the wrong of dragging out into the light of notoriety the descendants of the mother or those of the child .

		This is cruelty which can hide behind no shred of reason .

		A much pleasanter book is
Montagu	ORGANIZATION	's `` Na - poleon and His Adopted Son . ''

		No figure in the Napoleonic gallery is more attractive than that of
Eugene	PERSON	, Viceroy of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		As ruler of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's Italian kingdom he deserves a place among the makers of modern
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He was not a great statesman , and he was too subservient to his step-father 's will ; and yet during his reign
Italy	LOCATION	took certain steps in administrative and military reorganization which were not wholly retraced when the
Grand Empire	ORGANIZATION	fell .

		This work deals almost exclusively with
Eugene	PERSON	's personal and mili - tary career .

		One will consult it in vain for any adequate account of the Napoleonic re - gime in the Italian kingdom .

		The book is not free from inadvertencies , as , for example , when
Eugene	PERSON	at
Marengo	LOCATION	is said to have helped by `` his repeated charges to drive the Italian troops back into
Milan	LOCATION	. ''

		`` The Story-Life of Napoleon , '' by Mr.
Wayne Whipple	PERSON	, is a selection of anecdotes in regard to each succeeding incident or phase of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career , so arranged as to form a biography .

		There is evidently room for such a book , and the only question concerns the method by which it is constructed .

		If the reader should inquire what reason he has to suppose any particular story to be true , the editor offers him no assistance , for the stories are quoted indiscriminately from memoirs and secondary works of all sorts , some of which have no other merit than a readable style .

		The collection would have been far more help - ful if the editor had traced the stories back to the original sources .

		They could still have been given in the most attractive English form available .

		A story may be worth telling , al - though apocryphal , as , for example , the story of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's smashing the porcelain vase during his negotiations with Cobenzl prior to the
Peace of Campo Formio	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is still told as historical by so distinguished a historian as
Fournier	PERSON	.

		The author quotes from
Madame Junot	ORGANIZATION	's Memoirs the tale that at his coronation
Napoleon	PERSON	seized the crown to prevent the pope from placing it on his head .

		This tale is disposed of by
Frederick Masson	PERSON	in his recent work on the Coronation .

		The legend of the drowning of the Russians at
Austerlitz	LOCATION	is quoted from
Emerson	LOCATION	's ' ' Rep - resentative Men ' ' !

		In this group of books are two biographies of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, one a new edition of
Viscount Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's `` Decline and Fall of Napoleon , '' published first in
1895	DATE	, the other a `` Life of Napoleon '' by Major
Arthur Griffiths	PERSON	.

		Wolse - ley 's narrative opens with the campaign of
1812	DATE	, and is professedly a piece of military historical writing , especially interesting be - cause of its author 's competence upon the questions involved .

		The biography by Major
Griffiths	PERSON	deals with
Napoleon	PERSON	's whole career .

		It is written in a vigorous style , interspersed with wholesome English denunciations of Na - poleon 's conduct .

		It makes no compromise with the `` New History , '' giving hardly more than allusions to the great constructive achievements of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	and the Em - pire .

		The narrative is mainly concerned with political intrigue , diplomacy , and wars .

		It is brief , running only to the length of eighty thousand words .

		There are certain errors of statement which should be corrected .

		Young
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	did not `` beat the streets of
Paris	LOCATION	'' from
May	DATE	until
October , 1792	DATE	, hoping for reinstatement in the army .

		He 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	was reinstated with the rank of Captain on
July 10	DATE	, and his promotion was dated back to the preceding
February	DATE	.

		On his return from
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	could not have `` tried the
Jacobin Club	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' because this had been closed by
Fouche	PERSON	.

		Furthermore it is not true that the financial successes of the early
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	were due mainly to exactions similar to those which characterized
Napoleon	PERSON	's first Italian cam - paign .

		After all , these are minor blemishes ; the chief question is the distribution of in - terest .

		The significance of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career for
France	LOCATION	and for
Europe	LOCATION	is missed .


H. E. BOURNE	PERSON	.

		A HALF-FORGOTTEN AMERICAN PRESIDENT .

		* One would have expected an authorized biography of
Rutherford B. Hayes	PERSON	long ago , as it is now twenty-two years since his death .

		His friend
William Henry Smith	PERSON	had in fact begun such a work , but it was interrupted by the hand of death , in
1896	DATE	.

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's plan was an extended history of the time , woven about the life of
Hayes	PERSON	.

		A part of his ma - terial was published some years after his death in the form of two large volumes on '' The Political History of Slavery . ''

		On his death bed he had requested his son-in-law , Mr.
Charles Richard Williams	PERSON	, to finish the task .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	did not immediately find the time to fulfil this commission , but brought out the volumes on Slavery as a separate work , leaving the biography to be taken up by itself when opportunity should offer .

		Finding it possible to withdraw from other labor a few years ago , he set himself seriously at work upon the biography , which we now have be - fore us .

		It is safe to say that this change from Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's original plan means a much wider reading for the biography .

		Indeed , the com - pression of the subject into a single volume would have had a decided advantage in this respect , but anyone who is aware of the em - barras des richesses which the author had at his disposal in the old
Hayes	PERSON	mansion in Fre - mont will wonder only that he could have had the heart to practice a rigorous enough ex - clusion to keep within the limits of the two volumes here presented .

		Perhaps the
Hayes Diary	ORGANIZATION	, drawn upon constantly for this work , may some day be published in its entirety .

		The
Western Reserve Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	might find a useful field of endeavor here .

		During an inroad of the
Danes	PERSON	into the * THE LIFE OF
RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD	PERSON	HATES , Nineteenth President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		By
Charles Richard Williams	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		With portraits and other illustrations .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Frith of Tay , according to
Holinshed	LOCATION	, the Scots were hard beset and about to give way .

		Suddenly there appeared upon the scene a farmer named Haie , with his two sons .

		They had observed the plight of their countrymen from the field where they were at work , and grasping plough-beams in their hands they rushed upon the foe with such lusty vigor as to turn defeat into victory .

		`` And the
King	PERSON	gave them armes , three scutcheons gules in a field of silver , a plowbeame added thereunto which he used instead of a battell axe , when he fought so valiantlie in defense of his owne countrie . ''

		Of this family President
Hayes	PERSON	is said to have been a descendant .

		We know of no reason to doubt the connection , but it would have been of interest to the general reader to have had the evidence of it more fully stated .

		A third of a century has passed since the administration of President
Hayes	PERSON	closed , des - tined to have its sharper features suddenly blurred in the public eye and dulled in the public consciousness by the shot of the assassin of his successor .

		That time has justified those features of his policy which brought the im - mediate wrath of a large section of his own party heavily upon his head is now the opinion of most students of the period whose views are worth considering .

		Few Americans would now tolerate the thought of bolstering up by federal bayonets a state government wholly unable to command the support or respect of any considerable portion of the educated and responsible citizenship of the state , as had been done in parts of the South for some years before
Hayes	PERSON	entered upon his high office .

		The difficulty grew not out of the extension of the suffrage to the enfranchised negroes in itself , but out of the fact that the Republican Party of the time had not risen high enough to refrain from the temptation to organize this immense new body of ignorant and inexperi - enced voters into a solid partisan tool to be used by party manipulators against the southern whites .

		Hayes keenly realized the abhorrent conditions to which this unwisdom had led , and had the courage to withdraw the federal troops , which were the sole support of a number of wholly corrupt and inefficient Republican state `` governments , '' in spite of the fact that this action was sure to be con - strued by many as impeaching his own title to the Presidency .

		For the same returning boards upon whose action his own title rested had declared these Republican state officers duly elected .

		In the opinion of the reviewer , the author 's very extended account of the contested elec - tion is the least profitable part of his work .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 263 Much more readily than could have been ex - pected , the country settled down to the ac - ceptance of the verdict of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	as giving
Hayes	PERSON	a legally unim - peachable title to the Presidency .

		The country realized that a certain amount of discretion had to be lodged in this
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and at no time was there the slightest danger of any forcible uprising against its decision .

		Of course it was only to be expected that thou - sands would feel that this discretion had not been rightly used , and that some would feel that it had been corruptly used .

		Thirty-eight years have passed ; those most intensely in - terested have largely left the stage of life , and but little of the deep feeling of
1877	DATE	lingers .

		What good can there be in laboriously trying the whole question over again , attempting to prove what everybody knows , that there was Democratic intimidation of colored voters in the South ; slurring over what is equally known , that there was wholesale Republican corruption in the same quarter ; accusing Tilden of guilty knowledge of an attempt to secure an electoral vote by bribery , of which there is neither convincing proof nor inherent probability ; defending
Hayes	PERSON	against the now forgotten charge of paying for electoral votes by appointment of certain election officers to federal positions , of which there is equally neither valid evidence nor inherent proba - bility !

		All this is only stirring up a smudge which tends to conceal the real greatness of a really great and good President , and was wholly unnecessary to the completeness of the work , except in the briefest epitome .

		President
Hayes	PERSON	had many lovable traits of character .

		In the thick of the Civil War , with southern bullets flying about him and oc - casionally into him , he could write home to his wife deprecating untrue aspersions against the men of the South .

		His fundamental sense of right revolted against unnecessary destruc - tion of property in war , and the soldiers under him applied the torch only when he himself was constrained by written orders from su - perior authority .

		The later years of his life were marked by untiring devotion to Prison Reform and other philanthropic activities .

		His beautiful
Fremont	LOCATION	home was a centre of refined culture and high moral ideals , where men and women of the highest types of Ameri - can citizenship loved to gather .

		Our political evolutionists will perhaps tell us that he be - longs to a type irrevocably past ; but it re - mains true that the politics of the day would lose nothing by a liberal infusion of some of his most prominent characteristics .

		And all this can be said , and should have been said by Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, without casting any slur upon the ability and character of his opponent ,
Samuel J. Tilden	PERSON	, whose services to
New York	LOCATION	were those of a great and upright statesman and philanthropist .


W. H. JOHNSON	PERSON	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The anonymity of so remarkable a novel as `` Home , '' published about a year ago , could not long be preserved .

		It soon transpired that the author was Mr.
George Agnew	PERSON	Chamber - lain , the occupant of a consular post in
South America	LOCATION	.

		This accounted for the exotic graft upon the homely
New England	LOCATION	stock which made the work of such enticing interest .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's success has encouraged him to further production , in consequence whereof we now have `` Through Stained Glass , '' a novel which fairly matches `` Home '' in charm and depth of human revelation .

		Here also , we skip somewhat breathlessly about the globe , from
Virginia	LOCATION	to
South America	LOCATION	, thence to
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, and finally to
New England	LOCATION	.

		A
Leighton	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, after fighting for the Confederacy , seeks a new home for his family , and finds it in
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		Presently , a boy
Leigh	PERSON	- ton of the northern branch is consigned to his care , and grows up in happy childish compan - ionship with his cousin
Natalie	PERSON	.

		As he ap - proaches manhood , his father , who has been a wanderer over the face of the earth since the death of his wife in childbirth , seeks the boy out , and carries him off to
Europe	LOCATION	to make of him an artist and a gentleman .

		The boy is a perfect illustration of the way in which breed - ing will tell , for he fits into the ways of civiliza - tion without an effort , and knows by instinct how to do and say the right thing .

		For years the father and the son live in beautiful and devoted companionship , the former supplying the worldly wisdom of his sophisticated intel - lect illuminating life for the boy as `` through stained glass '' the son repaying this solicitude with affection , and preserving his own purity of soul while realizing his artis - tic self .

		He needs no curb to keep him from going astray , except in the one case of his infatuation for Miss Folly Delaires of the chorus , and here the father 's persuasive tact scores a triumph .

		There is no blustering about it , or declared opposition , but simply a little subtle manceuvering to bring the boy to his senses , and just the touch of cynicism that is needed to open his eyes .

		In the end , there is
Natalie	PERSON	, who has found a home in New En - gland , and has never ceased to hope for her * THROUGH STAINED GLASS .

		264 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	cousin-playmate 's return .

		The love story is very tenderly and delicately managed ; it leaves far more to the imagination than it ex - presses , which is the way of all true art .

		The action of this novel extends so widely over time and space that it is perforce swift , and its jerky movement hurries us on where we would gladly linger , but it tingles with vitality and glows with beauty on well-nigh every page .

		`` The Secret of the Reef , '' the latest novel by Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	, is written upon the stereotyped model with which his readers are familiar .

		There is an energetic and courage - ous hero , down on his luck , a heroine toward whom he aspires , and a villain who endeavors to thwart him in his efforts to win love and fortune .

		This villain is none other than the heroine 's father , which provides material for a conflict between romantic and filial love on the part of a high-souled maiden .

		There is never any doubt as to which love will come out ahead .

		The story is concerned with the sal - vage of a wrecked treasure ship , sunk on a reef in the Alaskan far north .

		The author has abundant knowledge of his material , but there is little of either imagination or literary grace in the telling of his story .

		Time was when a novel by the Castles con - noted joyous adventure and the very
spring	DATE	- tide poetry of romance .

		But to '' The Haunted Heart '' we can ascribe no such qualities .

		The delicate sentiment that we used to find in their work has become coarse and treacly ; the col - oring is garish , and emotion is strained to the breaking point .

		In the slang of a bygone gen - eration , this is a novel for which ' ' too utterly utter '' offers the only adequate description .

		Moreover , it makes a frank bid for cheap popu - larity by depicting the smart set in
London	LOCATION	society with the pencil of the caricaturist , much as Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	describes the corre - sponding abscess in our American social organism .

		The heart which is here haunted is that of the Master of Stronaven , whose wife , after fifteen years of devotion , discovers an early lapse from virtue on the part of her hus - band , and runs away from him with an Italian artist .

		After cooling his rage by smashing the furniture , the deserted husband goes lion - shooting in
Africa	LOCATION	, and returns to
England	LOCATION	a few months later with the fixed intention of marrying the first attractive girl he meets , in order to show the errant divorced wife that he does n ' t care .

		The match is soon found in the person of an heiress , the daughter of an un - speakably vulgar and snobbish parvenue from the Argentine , and
Ian	PERSON	weds her , while love for the vanished
Morna	PERSON	is still gnawing at his heart .

		The spooks prove too much for this heart , which breaks down after a few months of re-wedded life , and the former sharer of his couch comes post haste from her Italian villa just in time to apprise him before his death that she is sorry for her precipitate desertion , and that she has been his in spirit all the time .

		His brother , the Catholic priest , although overmuch given to moralizing , is the most sym - pathetic figure in this hectic work of fiction .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		It is a pleasant story that Mr.
W. Pett Ridge	PERSON	has written in `` The Happy Recruit '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , which tells of a small German boy in
London	LOCATION	, orphaned and left with a baby sister while still in school .

		He grows to manhood and a wished-for marriage in the progress of the narrative ; and his career , from its humble beginnings as a waiter and boy-of - all-work in a cheap hotel to the propri - etorship of a successful eating-house , really tells the well-to-do and prosperous how the other half becomes so .

		That a German should be given so affectionate a history by an Englishman is doubly grateful in these days of international hatreds .

		The book has abundant humor .

		The biography of a woman is set forth in much detail by Mrs.
Alice Birkhead	PERSON	in '' Destiny 's Daughter '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		The heroine inherits ability and an unusual type of good looks with nothing else .

		Sacrificing a good match for the sake of a younger sister , she is compelled to earn her living .

		Failing as a schoolmistress , she becomes private secretary to a self-made manufacturer with par - liamentary aspirations , a widower with grown chil - dren .

		His proposal drives her to the stage , for which she had early shown aptitude , and the slow path to success is courageously climbed .

		The end of the story is a surprise , almost a shock ; but the foundation for it has been well laid nevertheless .

		To be able to write a story with sound historic foundations that reads far better than any of the dreadful trash which passes current among many boys , is an achievement to be proud of .

		Mr.
Zane Grey	PERSON	has done this in '' The Lone Star Ranger '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , which is dedicated to the gallant body of men whose bravery and usefulness it records .

		Half the stirring tale is devoted to the manner in which
Buckley Duane	ORGANIZATION	is driven by inheritance and environment into outlawry ; the other half deals with his rehabilitation under the law as a
Texas	LOCATION	Ranger .

		Except for a chapter or two near the denouement , the record is as limpid as the story itself is turbulent , making a glorified and respect - able '' dime novel . ''


Philadelphia	LOCATION	society , assuredly not at its best , figures exclusively in Mrs.
Therese Tyler	PERSON	's '' The Dusty Road '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The heroine is an ambitious girl , brought up in genteel poverty by a mother whose life is spent in maintaining her social position in the face of huge discouragements .

		The girl is not socially ambitious , but longs for better things .

		In the progress of the story she has several lovers .

		One she treats with youthful in -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 265 tolerance .

		Another she dallies with until the reader almost loses sympathy for her , so much of a brute is he .

		At the end she finds her mate , rather to everybody 's surprise his , her own , and also the reader 's .

		The work is styled realistic , here syno - nymous with disagreeable .

		It certainly upsets the prevalent idea that
Philadelphia	LOCATION	is u slow . ''

		Miss
Elsie Singmaster	PERSON	has again dealt with the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Germans whom she knows and loves so well , in `` Katy Gaumer '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a simple tale of a young girl who finds her heart 's desire after long wandering .

		Under the love story lies an even more absorbing current , based on the silence of a good man who has been led by one crime into making a blunder ; and who allows an innocent man 's life to be ruined under accusation of crime .

		The book is truly an interpretation of a people who are a real part of American life , yet have kept old-country ways and habits of thought through generations of residence among us .

		With the knowledge given of them in such books as this , even this strangeness is bound to disappear .

		The
Philippines	LOCATION	have produced an unusual novel in Mr.
Walter Elwood	PERSON	's '' Guimo '' -LRB- ReiUy & Brit - ton -RRB- , which deals with the misfortunes of a young half-caste , the illegitimate son of a Spanish priest and a native woman , who lends his name to the book .

		There is much local color , laid on with a palette knife by the use on every page of native terms and native legends and superstitions ; but the writer seems really to have penetrated below the surface of an inexorably alien people and to disclose something of their thoughts and aspira - tions .

		Tragedy runs through the narrative to its close .

		Such a book , could it obtain wide circula - tion , would have a beneficent effect upon the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, and might interest them a little in their far
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	possessions .

		The title of Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	's new novel , '' Arundel '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , is the name of the country place inhabited by two of his characters , a widowed mother and a marriageable daughter .

		Next door lives an eligible young man , a broker by occupa - tion , but with a sincere love for and appreciation of music , poor performer though he is .

		The story opens in
India	LOCATION	, where the greatly loved daughter of an army officer , is about to leave him and her step - mother , to visit his sister , the lady of Arun - del .

		She , too , is a musician , and such a performer as the young man wishes himself to be .

		When she arrives her cousin and the broker are already be - trothed , one of those calm engagements based upon propinquity rather than passion .

		Music opens new vistas , and brings about a tense situa - tion which is only to be solved by the rather awkward expedient of death .

		The narrative is unusually well written , but others of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's stories have been better contrived . ''

		Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	's Man '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the skil - ful work of Mr.
St. John G. Ervine	PERSON	, who will be remembered for several plays produced in this country by the Irish Players .

		His novel , like these plays , has its scene near and in the Ulster metrop - olis of
Belfast	LOCATION	, and deals with Irish Protestants .

		Before the tale closes he places his protagonist , Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	, in as difficult a position as can well be imagined either for sister , wife , or mother .

		Without much schooling , with no help from kins - folk , relying little upon religion , she nevertheless wins her peace and solves her intricate problems by the exercise of common sense and a pragmatic philosophy which leave nothing to be desired .

		The character drawing is minute and striking ; the entire conception is dramatic and powerful ; and the leading character affords an example of human - ness which may well be emulated .

		Social problems disappear in the face of an individuality as well balanced as Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	's .

		Dartmoor is beloved of English novelists , and few have touched it without commending it to their readers .

		Mr.
John Trevena	PERSON	is one of the best known of these fiction writers , and his latest story of the hills and moors , '' Sleeping Waters '' -LRB-
Ken	PERSON	- nerley -RRB- , is a work of unusual fascination , as re - mote from the affairs of every-day living as poetry and imagination can make it .

		A Roman priest , stricken in health , is sent by a wealthy parishioner to the home of his ancestors , after having been regaled with local and family superstitions and traditions .

		He drinks of the waters of a
spring	DATE	which brings forgetfulness , apparently when fully convalescent , in reality while still in a sub-species of delirium .

		What follows is melodramatic , almost medisevally so , in the telling .

		A beautiful maiden , the spirit of the moors incarnate , wins him from his priestly vows , and in his attempt to gain her he fights all sorts of queer persons , a scoundrelly lawyer , a tool of a physician , a crazed and drunken mother , an ignorant tenantry steeped in its folly , and the elements themselves .

		The close of the book makes all sound and well again , though the priest renounces his church to gain a real love , shadowed at the book 's opening .

		Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	has written a vital criti - cism of American life in its bustling cities , and has called it , aptly enough , '' The Turmoil '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Where others have attacked moral , political , eco - nomic , and racial problems , he has taken aBsthetic ground , and has objected to our national quest for Bigness and its ensuing consequences as being in bad taste .

		He takes a family of father , mother , sister , and three brothers , every one of whom has lived with little knowledge of the amenities , either at home or abroad .

		But they would not be American if they had not some aspira - tions .

		The father has made his fortune , built him a mansion in a somewhat fashionable neighbor - hood , and the family looks about for social con - nections .

		Next their new house live people of better position than themselves , but now reduced to grinding poverty ; and the only child of the house , a daughter , conceives it to be her duty to her parents to marry one of the unmarried sons of the rich neighbors .

		The repellent sordidness of her procedure , baffled once by accidental death and an awakening of conscience , is reconciled with decency at the end of the book .

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	succeeds in making the story not only eminently readable and a model of constructive ability , but he keeps his readers in sympathy with all his char - acters , so humanly are they depicted and devel - oped .

		But it is curious to note how carefully the moral element is eliminated in the process .

		Its lesson is given by indirection .

		266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		That Mr.
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	Miscellanies deserves to be called a humanist , of a humanist ... not in the restricted Petrarchian sense of the term , nor indeed in the peculiar meaning attached to the word by Professor
Schiller	PERSON	, but with the larger connotations it carries with it in current speech , is abun - dantly proved , if proof were needed , by his latest book , `` Memories and Milestones '' -LRB-
Mof	ORGANIZATION	- fat ,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is issued in the conviction that the putting forth of such col - lections of personal reminiscence and more or less ripe reflection `` helps the general atmos - phere of thought and enriches everyone a little . ''

		`` With brief but carefully considered and always scholarly talks on art and ethical culture , on modern drama and the negro ques - tion , on
William James	PERSON	and
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	and
Julia `` Ward Howe	PERSON	, he both re - veals the range of his own interests and sympa - thies and opens to the reader many new and inviting vistas of speculation and inquiry .

		Like
William James	PERSON	, whose portrait serves as frontispiece to the book , and whose person - ality inspires one of its most readable chapters , Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	is perhaps even more suggestive than expressive ; but he seems not quite to have done justice to
James	PERSON	's genius in asserting of him that `` he had not the gift of expression , but rather the gift of suggestion . ''

		Nearer the truth would it be to say of that master of apt and original epithet , of brilliantly illumi - nating phrase or idiom , that he had both the gift of expression and , in a still greater degree , the gift of suggestion .

		A chapter on Har - vard 's distinguished and still active ex-presi - dent uses throughout the obituary past tense .

		Was the article `` released '' prematurely ?

		Certainly its very opening sentence , ' ' For half a century President
Eliot	PERSON	was one of the great personal figures in American life , '' with all that follows , carries implications that fortu - nately are not yet true .

		In his discussion of ``
Shaw	PERSON	and the Modern Drama '' the author shows himself fair-minded and not unappre - ciative of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's undeniable genius , but a little severe in his opinion that ' '
Shaw	PERSON	wants merely to get heard of and to make money ' ' as if such a purpose were not sure , in the very nature of things , to defeat its own ends .

		Bather , one might venture to say , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is immensely interested in his own ideas , in the kaleidoscopic oddity of aspect that the world presents to him ; after that the money and the fame are probably not unwelcome .

		But Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	wins assent when he continues : `` You can not say he is a man without heart : he is the kindliest of men .

		But he is a man without taste or reverence .

		He does not know that there are things which can not be made funny .

		He is a man in whose composition something is left out .

		You can not blame him , any more than you can blame the color-blind .

		He is beauty-blind , and amuses himself with seeing what grotesques he can pick out of the carpet of life . ' '

		The author takes occasion to say a good word , and a needed word , for the study of the classics , more particularly of Greek , `` as a pleasure , '' both in school and after school ; but he errs in calling
Caesar	PERSON	's `` Commentaries '' the `` dullest book in Latin . ''

		That is the schoolboy 's natural misconception .

		There are many Latin books , especially of post-classical authorship , that far exceed
Cassar	PERSON	in dulness , if
Caesar	LOCATION	be dull .

		Now and then a misspelled foreign word , as Zeitgheist and the unpluralized first element in morceau choisis , disfigures Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's scholarly page .

		Portraits of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, and
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, to the last-named of whom he devotes one of his best chapters of mingled reminiscence and characterization and suggestive observation , find appropriate place in the volume , in addition to the portrait of James already mentioned .

		The book is the best of its sort that has yet come from its author 's pen .

		Defects and mos t recent of Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	possibilities of
C. Howe	ORGANIZATION	's three or four books the modern city .

		Qn municipa l affairg bearg the ambitious and alluring title , `` The Modern City and its Problems '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In an earlier volume of the series Mr.
Howe	PERSON	has developed with much ingenuity the thesis that in the city lies the hope of democratic institu - tions , and in another book he has described concretely the conduct of municipal activities in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In the pres - ent work he traverses ground considerably more extended .

		Almost every Division of the subject , historical and descriptive , which re - ceives attention in the text-books is accorded a chapter , and the more recently developed problems of municipal administration , such as city planning , housing , and recreation , are dealt with in considerable detail .

		Both Ameri - can and European cities come within the scope of the survey .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is ready enough to admit , as most people are , that the American city `` lags behind the work it should properly perform , ' ' that it is '' negative in its functions rather than positive in its services , '' and that `` it has so little concern for its people that they in turn have little concern for it . ' '

		And his views concerning the cause of this state of affairs and its remedy are rather out of the ordinary .

		The difficulty , he believes , is not to be sought in the character of the American
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 267 people , or in their supposed neglectful atti - tude toward politics and their tolerance of evil .

		It is only an assumption , he maintains , that they have willingly abdicated their re - sponsibilities and turned the city over to the professional politician as an easy escape from the burdens which its management imposes .

		The conditions of neglect , partisanship , and tolerance of evil which exist are declared to be traceable back to legal institutions , to con - stitutional and political limitations under which the people are compelled to work in municipal affairs .

		The remedy lies in less rather than more restraint , greater rather than less municipal activity .

		`` These condi - tions can only be corrected by a programme of city building , of city service , through com - pulsory co-operation , or socialization .

		To this co-operation there are no set limits .

		For many years to come the city will continue to increase its activities and enlarge its services .

		This is the lesson of the past ; it is the promise of the future . ''

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	writes , as he remarks , from the inside of the city .

		From the time when , a good many years ago , he saw active service in the city council and on the finance commission of
Cleveland	LOCATION	until his recent ap - pointment as commissioner of immigration at
New York	LOCATION	, his tasks have fallen where the problems of the city loom largest .

		Whatever he writes bears the stamp of experience and of conviction , and is , in addition , eminently readable .

		Inevitably one who writes so frankly for the casual reader falls into errors of gen - eralization .

		Thus , Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is led to make the somewhat astonishing remark that even to-day civilization in the rural districts `` does not progress beyond its simplest forms . ''

		But the fault is one which can be overlooked by any one who cares for fresh , vigorous , and stimulating writing on a subject of vital present-day importance .

		About one-third of the 333 tSS , P a ges of Mr.
Willard Hunting	PERSON	- ton `` Wright 's `` What Nietzsche Taught '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is devoted to the life of the philosopher and the genesis of his works , and the rest to excerpts from the works .

		It is a helpful book for the beginner who ap - proaches
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	with the query that will not down : What did he say ?

		It is not a criticism , but a presentation ; and as such it is excellent , despite a few inaccuracies .

		Fr .


W. Ritschl	PERSON	did not `` found the science of his - torical literary criticism as we know it to - day '' -LRB- page 27 -RRB- , but the Schlegels ; though
Nietzsche	PERSON	meant the
Fall of Wagner	ORGANIZATION	by his `` Der
Fall Wagner	PERSON	, '' it is altogether wrong to translate the title in this way -LRB- page 38 -RRB- ;
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's friend was
Malvidavon Meysenbug	PERSON	not `` Mysenburg '' -LRB- page 41 -RRB- ; Vauvenargues would not recognize himself as `` Vanergues '' -LRB- page 45 -RRB- ;
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's etymologies of bonus and bellum have not been unreservedly ac - cepted -LRB- page 207 -RRB- ; and Mr.
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	, to whom the volume is dedicated , has not been `` the critic who has given the greatest impetus to the study of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in this coun - try , '' that was done by the separate intro - ductions to the various translations published in this country by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, and by the works of
Halevy	LOCATION	,
Kennedy	LOCATION	, and
Miigge	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are three contentions , on the other hand , that are irrefutable : to know
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in part he must be studied as a whole ; there are no important contradictions in his philoso - phy ; and he has had , next to
Kant	PERSON	, the greatest influence on the development of mod - ern thought .

		It is difficult to think to-day apart from
Nietzsche	LOCATION	; he expressed himself on every subject .

		What he says may not be pleasant ; it does not lull to ease , but arouses to action .

		On this account a careful selection of his commitments on burning questions is valuable .

		We may look in vain for some of our most cherished apothegms , and we may find others that strike us as negligible : but on the whole , we find enough to make us think , and that is a vast deal .

		Just as one should begin the study of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's works with `` Human , All too Human , '' so could one most advantageously undertake the study of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	with Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's volume .

		Besides containing the essential facts of the great Yea-Say er 's life , it contains also the greatest truths he expressed during his life .

		Each of the former may be a blind alley that leads nowhere ; but each of the latter has a horizon - widening quality that is most invigorating .

		`` The symbol of the modern soul , ''
Nietzsche	PERSON	says , `` is the labyrinth . ''

		True , and he has thrown out a number of life-lines by which we may work our way through it .

		The strongest of these are contained in this book , which has also a bibliography compiled with common-sense .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's opinion of Ger - Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	man y a nd the German Emperor on barbarism .

		.

		1-1 ,1 is no secret to the world at large , and the vehement expression of that opinion as contained in the little book entitled `` The Appetite of Tyranny '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- will give no shock of surprise to anyone who has been for the past few months even a hasty reader of the daily hodge-podge of intelligence and mis - intelligence printed by the newspaper press concerning the great war .

		It is his `` Barbar - ism of
Berlin	LOCATION	'' and `` Letters to an Old
Gari	PERSON	- baldian '' that are brought within the covers 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	of the above-named book , which shows its bril - liant author in highly characteristic vein as , indeed , what writing from his pen does not ?

		and inevitably reveals some of the faults inseparable from such astonishing clev - erness of intellect and enviable facility of expression .

		The excellence of the book lies in its forceful and original and convincing demonstration of that quality of German mili - tarism -LRB- and in fact of all militarism , though the limitation is not removed -RRB- which Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	chooses to call barbarism , and which indicates , not an insufficiency of twen - tieth-century civilization , such as , with some reason , may be urged in dispraise of the Russians , but a ruthless disregard of certain fundamental principles that can not be sacri - ficed without plunging us all back into chaos and black night .

		The less praiseworthy fea - ture of the book is found in its unsparing vehemence of invective , in its author 's allow - ing himself to be carried away by his own momentum , as when he writes : `` So strongly do the instincts of the Prussian drive against liberty , that he would rather oppress other people 's subjects than think of anybody going without the benefits of oppression .

		He is a sort of disinterested despot .

		He is as disinter - ested as the devil who is ready to do any one 's dirty work . ''

		In further illustration of the books tone , let this be added : `` Wherever the most miserable remnant of our race , astray and dried up in deserts , or buried forever under the fall of bad civilizations , has some feeble memory that men are men , that bar - gains are bargains , that there are two sides to a question , or even that it takes two to make a quarrel that remnant has the right to resist the New Culture , to the knife and club and splintered stone .

		For the Prussian begins all his culture by that act which is the destruction of all creative thought and constructive action .

		He breaks that mirror in the mind , in which a man can see the face of his friend or foe . ''

		The two parts of the book are essentially one in purpose and manner , and both are eminently and brilliantly Chestertonian .

		Some new memorials of the Brownings .

		The announcement of a volume of `` New Poems by
Robert Browning	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Bar	PERSON	- rett Browning '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- must have been hailed with joyful anticipation by thousands of
Browning	PERSON	lovers .

		Something of the old thrill many of us recall upon the appearance of `` Ferishtah 's Fancies , '' `` Asolando , '' or `` Aurora Leigh '' stirred again , together with a vague hope that by some good fortune something equally momentous might have been unearthed even at this late day .

		Let us not be too ungrateful , even though this some - what unreasonable hope has not been fulfilled ; let us be glad that we can add twenty-nine poems to our `` complete editions '' of
Robert Browning	PERSON	and six to those of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	.

		There will be a difference of opinion as to the righteousness of these addenda , a doubt whether it is just to a poet to rake his desk , after he has gone , for what he has himself discarded .

		Seldom indeed does his poetical reputation gain by such a proceeding ; never - theless when these discarded works are put up for sale at public auction , as many of the present collections were two years ago , it seems only decently respectful to beloved memories to rescue them from almost certain loss or annihilation .

		In the present volume notes have been added by such competent hands as those of Messrs.
Frederic G. Kenyon	PERSON	.


Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, and
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, telling all that is known of the literary or biblio - graphical history of the poems .

		Perhaps the chief interest , however , will be found in some thirty-five pages of criticisms written by
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	to her future husband on his submitting to her in manuscript certain of his poems .

		`` Saul '' and `` Luria '' are two of the poems which seem to have received her special care , and one has only to compare the lines as first written with their present form to realize how much they gain by the sensitive and sensible suggestions .

		We discover some - thing quite contradictory to the accepted tra - dition that each worked entirely independent of the other .

		A reproduction of the earliest known portrait of
Browning	PERSON	, made from an old daguerreotype , and one of
Elizabeth Bar	ORGANIZATION	- rett from a miniature painting , are the sole illustrations .

		An optimist in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		A travel-book which shows un - usual sympathy and insight is Mr.
Clayton Sedgwick Cooper	PERSON	's `` The Modernizing of the Orient '' -LRB-
McBride	ORGANIZATION	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is the result of two world - journeyings , and its chapters deal with condi - tions in
North Africa	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Burma	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Descrip - tive passages are not infrequent , but Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	was most interested in the social , edu - cational , and religious `` modernizing '' which is now in process throughout the once `` un - changing East . ' '

		In gathering his information he was catholic and judicious , so that he is able to present not only the views of Western officials and missionaries , but also of thought - ful natives .

		The chapters on educational progress in
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	, on religious transformation in
India	LOCATION	and
Burma	LOCATION	, and on social changes in
India	LOCATION	, are
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 269 very suggestive .

		A prevailing note is that of optimism .

		Although he visited
China	LOCATION	just before the ill-starred counter-revolution , yet he believes the Chinese `` will bring victory out of defeat in accordance with their im - memorial habit of stumbling along through chaos to order , accomplishing often the seem - ingly impossible . ''

		And a sympathetic ap - preciation of the good points of the eastern peoples is constantly manifest , the Filipinos alone proving a disappointment , but then the chapter on the
Philippines	LOCATION	is in itself dis - appointing .

		In matters of opinion , although Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	will not have all the authorities on his side , yet he will find very general support for his statements .

		Errors in fact are sur - prisingly few : ' ' five hundred lakhs ' ' are con - siderably more than `` one-half million , '' and a new definition would be necessary in order to show that ninety per cent of the people of
India	LOCATION	are agricultural .

		There are , also , a few typographical errors , such as
Banio	LOCATION	,
Morro	LOCATION	,
Mindano	LOCATION	, for
Baguio	LOCATION	, Moro , and
Mindanao	LOCATION	.

		The play that won
$ 10,000	MONEY	.

		Apple-trees and larkspur and lilacs in bloom , shimmering gowns and rose-trimmed bonnets of an older time , sap mounting and everything breaking bounds because of springtime and love in
New England	LOCATION	, all this adds charm to the graceful manner in which Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	has presented her theme in the play , ' ' Children of Earth ' ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story is that of
Mary Ellen	PERSON	, whom
Peter Hale	PERSON	per - suades that nothing else matters but love not even
Jane	PERSON	, the drunken gypsy wife who has long been to him as one that is dead .

		Resolved to live their own lives , the two steal away ; unexpectedly
Jane	PERSON	's grief at their going clouds their radiant and belated day of
spring	DATE	.

		They return to do what is `` right , '' the three resuming their neighborly duties as though the incident had never been .

		This is beautiful , perhaps ; but it is not life .

		Did Miss
Brown	PERSON	's idealism cause her to forget at the end that her characters are children of earth ?

		What if
Jane	PERSON	's nature is still unsub - dued ?

		Or if
Peter	PERSON	wavers some day when impulse and passion catch noble resolve on the rebound ?

		Or if
Mary Ellen	PERSON	herself either revolts , in a moment of wild abandon , against the instinct of imprisoning her emotions for - ever , or else lives to witness the slow and sordid death , for want of expression , of what she believed was love ?

		The days to come will bring forth the real struggle , a struggle poignant , intense ; not even the restriction of the sub-title , `` a play of
New England	LOCATION	, '' con - vinces of the contrary .

		This struggle , together with a solution , whatever it may be , the author has evaded and has missed thereby the oppor - tunity for a powerful dramatic appeal , with - out which the crux of the story is merely an episode requiring one act for its presentation instead of four .

		The conventional ending would show
Mary Ellen	PERSON	going away .

		Since she stays , we demand another glimpse of these strong characters to reveal whether they stand or bend or break .

		There are promises here of a something which justifies Mr.
Winthrop Ames	PERSON	in the belief that his ten-thousand dollar prize was wisely awarded .

		As it is , however , the play is incomplete .

		It does not satisfy .

		And , after all , should not all art , as
George Gissing	PERSON	suggested , be `` an expression , satisfy - ing and abiding , of the zest of life '' ?

		BRIEFERJKENTION .

		Nothing new by way of praise or dispraise can be said of the English `` Who 's Who '' for
1915	DATE	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which carries the volume to the sixty - seventh year of issue and usefulness .

		There are now 250,000 biographies included , together with additional current information , within its
2500	DATE	pages .

		And still the dimensions remain prac - ticable .

		The issue in attractive form and pocket size of '' Woman and War , '' a chapter reprinted from Mrs. Olive
Schreiner	PERSON	's '' Woman and Labor , '' deserves mention , even amid the present deluge of war lit - erature .

		While much that is produced to-day is ephemeral , this essay , written a dozen odd years ago , still stands among the most distinctive and forceful condemnations of war of our day .

		Messrs.
Stokes	PERSON	are the publishers .

		`` The Elements of the Short Story , '' by Pro- fessor
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	, Jr. , and Mr.
Fred	PERSON	-
erick T. Dawson	PERSON	, is an eminently sane and useful book .

		While most editors of recent collections of short stories have striven for novelties in the way of translations and selections from recent magazine literature , Messrs.
Hale	PERSON	and
Dawson	PERSON	have had the courage to confine themselves to the best and best - known work of a half-dozen American authors whose reputations have been tried by time .

		The illustrations of various types of story are well chosen ; and the editorial matter , while slight in amount , is pointed and suggestive .

		-LRB-
Holt	PERSON	. -RRB-

		Dr.
Frederick Tupper	PERSON	and Dr.
James W. Tup	PERSON	- per have chosen a dozen plays for the volume whose title explains their selection , ''
Represen	PERSON	- tative English Dramas from
Dryden	PERSON	to Sheridan '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The inclusion of '' She
Stoops	PERSON	to Conquer , '' `` The Rivals , '' and `` The School for Scandal '' is necessary no doubt , on the score of completeness ; although these plays can be ob - tained in numerous satisfactory editions for a mere two-pence .

		By restricting the period covered , the editors might instead have used the space for some of the more inaccessible plays , in fact , those from the very authors whose omission is referred to with regret in the introductory note .

		The bibliography and the notes at the end of the vol - ume are excellent in every way .

New Rochelle	ORGANIZATION	's new library building has now seen a year of use , and the librarian reports an encouraging activity in the various departments of the institution .

		Here is a significant scrap from her annual record : `` A review of the year 's work shows a marked tendency toward sociological study and investigation .

		Several people have been aided in the production of books , and in one case the location of an obscure town in
England	LOCATION	was the means of establishing communication with the beneficiary of a will , an instance of the practical value of reference work . ''

		A new language , that of the Esquimaux , has just gained a place in the world of books through the medium of a volume called '' Singnagtugag '' in English , '' The Dream , '' written by an Esquimau clergyman , and published in

		of his boyhood which throw much fresh light on the customs of the
Esquimaux	LOCATION	.

		A Danish correspondent of the Lon - don '' Nation , '' who has examined the book , states that it has a distinct ironic vein which finds ex - pression in the conclusion a dream of a self - governed

England	LOCATION	under the title of '' Boon , the Mind of the Race , the Last Asses of the Devil , and the Last Trump , '' described as being '' the table-talk of a deceased literary man , with some fragments of his unpublished works , '' com - piled by his executor ,
Reginald Bliss	PERSON	.

		George Boon , '' the author of irreproachable novels of world-wide fame , '' is apparently not so much dead as missing .

		These literary remains of the vanished author are published as a sort of satirical com - jnentary upon the times , and especially upon the book world of to-day .

		Twenty-one new volumes are to be added at once to '' Everyman 's Library '' by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		Among them are Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's '' Life of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, '' the second volume of
Froude	PERSON	's '' Short Studies , '' Dostoevsky 's '' ' Poor Folk ' and ' The Gambler , ' '' translated by Mr.
C. J. Hogarth	PERSON	, whose translation of Erckmann-Chatrian 's '' Story of a Peasant , '' in two volumes , is also added to the department of fiction ; Mignet 's '' History of the French Revolution , '' with an introduction by Mr.
L. Cecil Jane ; Josephus	PERSON	's `` Wars of the Jews , '' with an introduction by Dr.
Jacob Hart	PERSON	;
Emer	PERSON	- son 's Poems , with an introduction by Professor
Bakewell	PERSON	, of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	;
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's '' Brand '' translated by Mr.
F. E. Garrett	PERSON	; and an `` Anthology of British Historical Speeches and Orations , '' compiled by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	.


Walter Crane	PERSON	, the English artist , author , and lecturer , died on
March 15	DATE	, at the age of seventy .

		His first illustrated book , '' The New Forest , '' ap - peared in
1863	DATE	.

		During his long career he has won many high honors , including membership in several of the principal academies in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent .

		His published writings include `` An Artist 's Reminiscences , '' ''
India	LOCATION	Impressions , '' and ''
William Morris	PERSON	and
Whistler	LOCATION	. ''

		Of his work in illustration , through which he was most widely known , the sumptuous edition of Spenser 's '' Faerie Queene '' is doubtless the best example .

		His famous '' toy-books '' are known to children everywhere .

		The type of gift-book represented by his '' Flower Wedding , '' `` A Masque of Days , '' '' Flowers from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Garden , '' etc. , and several others , was extremely popular with an older generation . ''

		Studies in Philology '' will hereafter be pub - lished by
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	in the form of a quarterly journal .

		The first number , bearing the date
January , 1915	DATE	, contains a critical edition by Professor
James H. Hanford	PERSON	of '' Wine ,
Beere	PERSON	, Ale , and Tobacco , Contending for Su - periority , '' a curious debate play , hitherto acces - sible only in a rare reprint .

		Besides being of value because of its numerous contemporary allusions , relating particularly to the manners and customs of the tavern , this text has special interest for the student of Elizabethan drama as a survival of the interlude and as a specimen of the minor entertain - ments in vogue at the universities .

		In his intro - duction Professor
Hanford	PERSON	has discussed the sources of the material and shown the close con - nection existing between this piece and several well-known
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	plays .

		The first , second , and third editions have been collated for the first time , and the text has been fully illustrated in notes .

		In form , the new quarterly is eminently attractive .


Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, historian and publicist , direct descendant of two
United States	LOCATION	presidents , son of one of our most distinguished diplomats , and otherwise claiming the regard and remem - brance of posterity , died at his winter home in
Washington	LOCATION	,
March 20	DATE	.

		Born in
Boston	LOCATION	,
May 27 , 1835	DATE	, and graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1856	DATE	, he studied law in the office of
Richard Henry Dana	PERSON	, author of '' Two Years before the Mast , '' and was admitted to the bar , but had hardly entered upon the practice of his profession before the outbreak of the war claimed his energies , and its close found him more interested in railway management , in various public questions , and in historical and other studies , than in the calling which he had at first chosen .

		In the field of letters and learning he is to be remembered for his epoch-making Phi Beta Kappa oration at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1883	DATE	, when he delivered himself of sundry opinions concerning `` A College Fetich '' -LRB- classical studies -RRB- that are thought to have turned the tide at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and beyond in favor of the sciences in education , for his biography of
Richard Henry Dana	PERSON	, his '' Three Episodes of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	History , '' ''
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , its Historians and its History , '' the life of his father in the `` American Statesmen '' series , and several volumes of miscellanies on historical , diplomatic , and military themes .

		Two years ago he delivered at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	a course of lectures on American history .

		His long connection with the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, his repeated re - election to the
Harvard Board of Overseers	ORGANIZATION	, his many appointments to public positions of im - portance , and the learned degrees and other honors conferred upon him , bore witness to the high esteem in which he was held .

		A clear and ready writer , with aptitude for historical research , he made notable contributions to the history of his native State , and wrote also with mastery of other sub - jects .

April 1 , 1915	DATE	`` VICTORY '' By
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	'' Victory '' tells the romance of
Axel Heyst	PERSON	and
Lena	PERSON	, the girl from a traveling Ladies ' Orchestra , and their strange life on the deserted
South Sea Island	LOCATION	of Samburan .

		Cut off from civilization ex - cept for the monthly passing of a trading vessel , they live there undisturbed until the sinister descent upon the island of those ill-omened messengers of the outside world , '' plain Mr.
Jones	PERSON	'' and Ricardo .

		Then for the first time the tender - ness and pathos of this strange romance is unveiled to the reader .

		The appeal in '' Victory '' is universal .

		It is the story of a woman 's love , superb in its faith and triumph , told in a simple , direct style that is the antithesis of his last novel , '' Chance . ''

		Garden City
New York	LOCATION	`` A narrative that gets under way on the very first page , and proceeds unin - terruptedly to a sforzando and melo - dramatic close .

		Conrad applies to the unfolding of it all the resources of his extraordinary art , and particularly all his gift for the dark , the threatening , the sinister .

		`` From the moment that
Jones	PERSON	and Ricardo reach the crazy island jetty , sun - blistered , purple - faced , half dead of thirst from this moment to the last scene of all , there is no halting or turn - ing aside .

		`` Put upon paper by a lesser man it would become a mere penny-dreadful .

		But as it is told by Conrad it takes on the Homeric proportions of an epic , a saga .

		Told in a straightforward , almost bald manner , with no apparent effort to build up effects , it yet leaves upon the mind a picture almost as vivid and as haunting as that left by Heart of Dark - ness .

		It is closer to the conventional novel than anything else he has done , and yet it is full of his characteristic touches . ''

		CRITICAL ESSAYS of THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY , 1700-1725 .

		Edited by
WILLARD H. DURHAM	PERSON	, Ph.D. , Instructor in English in the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	,
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
first quarter	DATE	of the eighteenth century witnessed the publication of a number of valuable literary criticisms , which have since become so rare as to be inaccessible save in one or two large libraries .

		It has remained for Dr.
Durham	LOCATION	to assemble them from their remote shelyes and to group them in the present volume , with enough of those better known to represent fairly the various types of English critical thought current at that time .

		Taken together thus , the essays shed new light on the period and lead to new deductions which make necessary a reconsideration of many generalizations which have heretofore been commonly received .

		By

M.A.	LOCATION	.

		This first volume of
Brian Hooker	PERSON	's verse will realize ^ the reading public 's high expectation of his talent , based on his fugitive pieces as well as on his success in the opera field .

		His poetry is marked by a surety of touch , a sincerity of purpose and a felicity of expression as rare in contemporary verse as it is welcome .

		While it covers a wide range of feeling and is expressed in several lyric forms , not once is there a surrender in the poet 's lofty conception of his task nor the eager upright - ness of his philosophy .

		312 PLAT OR PAMPHLET ?

		After the debauch of wit in the Restoration Comedy and
Jeremy Collier	PERSON	's triumph over the stage , audiences became virtuous , and play providers gave them what they wanted in tragedies which would turn them to repen - tance and comedies which would make them cry .

		The French called the new species of drama la comedie larmoyante .

		Diderot in
France	LOCATION	,
Steele	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, and even
Lessing	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	gave in to the fashion , though the latter soon recovered himself .

		When the real comic spirit rose again incarnate in Gold - smith he had great difficulty in getting a hearing .

		His `` Good Natured Man '' was de - nounced as `` low , '' and the scene with the Bailiffs was hissed . ' '

		She Stoops to Conquer ' ' was rejected by one manager , and held by another for a year .

		Literary fashions , like those of women 's clothes , recur in cycles , and for a good while we have had a surfeit of what may be called the preaching mania on the stage .

		Where do all the wild-eyed faddists come from who in their multitude have burst into the theatre with plays of every conceivable kind except plays of amusement , of poetic exaltation , of creative power ?

		Every reform , or what fan - tastic minds conceive to be a reform , must have its play .

		We have had plays of sexology , of education , of hygiene , and what not .

		The plays on hygiene seem to predominate .

		We suppose we shall next have a play on the negro theory that you should cut your corns in the dark of the moon .

		This would be harmless compared with the dramatization of medical treatises with which we have been regaled of late .

		This pamphleteering drama seems to have had its origin with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now
Ibsen	PERSON	was a playwright of the first water , and in his early romantic dramas and in his long dramatic poems a genuine poet .

		There are gleams of humor and of common sense in his comedies .

		But his formula for a comedy seems to have been this : Find some sore spot in humanity and make a play of it .

		And his lugubrious dramas and their progeny have filled the thea - tres of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		288 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	Particularly is
America	LOCATION	favorable soil for this pamphleteering seed .

		If anybody neglects an opportunity to preach in this country , he is suspect .

		Our public men go around like
Joseph Surface	PERSON	, with his eternal `` the man who . ''

		The didactic instinct is rooted in us , and has been strong enough to stifle any genu - ine creative impulse , except in the case of a few who have dared to `` see life steadily and see it whole . ''

		That this didactic turn in us is accompanied by any greater average goodness than among other peoples may be questioned .


Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	once rebuked the present writer for using the stock phrase , ' ' the
New England	LOCATION	conscience . ' '

		He thought it a bugbear , and had lived more than four - score years among such consciences without finding any excess of them .

		But that the moralizing strain outweighed the artistic one among his neighbors is only too patent .

		That art should be immoral or even unmoral is nonsense .

		In the drama , more than any other form of art , there is a clash of opposites , of good and evil , of the beautiful and the ugly , of the graceful and the grotesque .

		That any sane dramatist should prefer the inferior qualities or things is practically impossible .

		But he ought to have full liberty to set them forth in all their power and repulsiveness .

		He ought to be fair to the energy , intellect , and share of goodness in the personages in whom are embodied the lower principles .

		His heroes can not be all white , or his villains all black .

		The ` a < > .

		apria of Aristotle was that fatal weakness in the central character from which the catastrophe arose .

		Besides , there is no fixed system of morality .

		Is war right or wrong ?

		Is divorce right or wrong ?

		Must one , as
Kant	PERSON	maintained , always tell the truth , even to a murderer seeking his victim ?

		Is it criminal for a starving man to steal food ?

		Is it murder or patriotism to kill a despot ?

		These and many other questions have always been debated .

		Whole shoals of plays have been based on views of morality now obsolete or partially so .

		The dramatist has wide lati - tude .

		If he communicates the shock of vital strength to us , or permeates us with a sense of beauty , it is as much as we have a right to expect .

		But the pamphleteering dramatist takes some abstract question of morality , or some concrete custom , and argues it out by the means of puppets to whom no fair play is allowed , who are merely punching-bags for his intellectual exercise .

		The play with a purpose was preceded by the novel with a purpose .

		Dickens had usually some direct utilitarian or charitable end to carry out .

		But it was always so swamped by the overwhelming humor and creative force of his work that it gives readers of to-day no concern .

		Victor
Hugo	PERSON	, too , in his greatest novel tilted against all the wrongs and injustices of the world ; but here , also , the interest of the narrative and the flood of poetry sweep us along and make us forget that we are witnessing a social insurrection .

		It is perhaps too soon to criticize the purpose plays , but we doubt whether they are clothed with enough poetry and humor and created flesh to make us forget the grinning skeleton of their didacticism .

		We are inclined to think that they have less staying quality than even the despised Victorian drama .

		Such plays as `` Richelieu , '' `` The Lady of
Lyons	PERSON	, '' `` The Hunchback , '' `` Masks and Faces , '' and ' ' Caste ' ' have held the boards for a long time .

		Bulwer and
Reade	PERSON	had probably as much intel - lectual force as the problem men , and they seem to have produced figures and scenes of permanent appeal to mankind .

		It is perhaps in order to say what should take the place of the purpose play .

		Well , there is the whole spectacle of life to choose from .

		There are a billion and a half people in the world , and something is happening to them every day .

		There is the whole recorded past to furnish subjects .

		And the mind of man can invent , and can at least make an at - tempt to pierce into the realm of death and the unknown .

		The Moving Picture shows , what - ever may be their shortcomings , can at least give us a hint of what is wanted .

		We believe the managers of these entertainments have tried a few problem subjects , but that they did not in the least succeed .

		Stories of adven - ture , of romantic love and domestic devotion , of great crimes , of moving accidents by land and sea , of uproarious fun , these take best .

		Shilling shockers like the `` Agamemnon , '' `` Macbeth , '' or `` Faust '' are really what the world craves in the way of excitement : hero - ism and pure love and undying devotion al - ways appeal to it .

		The taste of the public is always sound , only it is not educated up to the adequate literary presentation of its favorite themes .

		When we consider that the Athenian public , with its wonderfully trained intelligence , banished ^ Eschylus and preferred Euripides to Sophocles we can hardly expect
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 289 perfect critical judgment from our own motley population .

		To be more specific , we think the drama should confine itself more strictly to its various kinds .

		A tragedy ought to be a tragedy , and a comedy a comedy .

		Mixing of distinct breeds rarely brings good results .

		It would be pretty hard to classify some of the plays of Ibsen or
Strindberg	LOCATION	.

		Comedy ought to recover its gaiety and shed its weeds of woe .

		Signs are not wanting that the purpose-problem-pam - phlet style of play is going out of fashion .

		There have been produced in
New York	LOCATION	this past winter a considerable number of plays calculated to amuse intelligent people .

		If to these could be added some dramas of poetic exaltation , some tragedies that plumb the depths , we should have the beginning of a serious theatre in this country .

		The question of a drama poetic not only in intent but in form is an interesting one .

		There is no real reason except a stupid preju - dice why verse should not be used again upon the stage .

		It is a pity to banish it , for it is to a play something like what a frame is to a picture .

		It separates the play from the world , and concentrates its effects .

		But we believe that blank verse , which is the most flexible and natural of metres , is impossible , simply be - cause it has been preempted .

		A modern blank verse play inevitably seems a faded copy of a Shakespearean original .

		The best poets and metrists of recent times
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	have tried to galvan - ize this form into life , all to little purpose .

		But there are plenty of other metrical forms .

		The heroic couplet reigned for a considerable time on the English stage , and it might be revived .

		The lyric choruses of the Greek drama lightened up the grave iambic verse .

		The Spanish drama used a great variety of metres and forms , huddling together asso - nant verse , redondillas , canzonets , and son - nets in a single play .

		There is something like this variety in the early plays of Shake - speare `` Love 's Labour 's Lost , '' for in - stance .

		Verse of some kind we ought to have , for we can never get with prose the concen - tration or the atmosphere requisite for the greatest dramatic effects .

		The purpose-problem play came into being mainly from one cause , the unrest of women and their desire to have their wrongs and rights expounded on the stage .

		Possibly this has been sufficiently done , and now men may demand their innings ; or , rather , men and women together may recur to the elemental things of life , loves , hates , heroisms , sacri - fices , and demand these from the stage .

		They are demanding them from the Moving Picture shows , and the speaking theatre is surely a more satisfactory thing .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		FRENCH APPRECIATION OF ENGLISH LITERA - TURE , so far as that appreciation is manifested by scholars and writers , has in recent times been greatly in contrast with earlier ignorance of and contempt for the writings of those benighted beings so unfortunate as to have been born outside of
France	LOCATION	.

		Flippant dis - praise of Shakespeare is no longer considered smart in the literary circles of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Of course
Taine	PERSON	is the conspicuous modern in - stance of French appreciation of the writers of
England	LOCATION	, but for one such sympathetic stu - dent of those writers half a century ago there are now a dozen or more in the
France	LOCATION	of to-day .

		Professor
Emile Legouis	PERSON	, who holds the chair of English language and literature at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, and is widely known for his published works in his department , naturally comes to mind in this connection .

		A notable article from his pen appears in the current issue of ' ' The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' under the head - ing , '' English Literature in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		His opening sentence is significant .

		He says : `` The opinion now prevailing in
England	LOCATION	, and beginning to spread in
America	LOCATION	, seems to be , if I am well informed , that , outside of the English-speaking countries themselves ,
France	LOCATION	is as distinctly ahead of other nations in En - glish literary criticism , properly so called , as
Germany	LOCATION	has long been and still remains in English philology . ''

		A little later , in consid - ering the `` erudite -LRB- historical , objective , scien - tific -RRB- mode '' of studying English literature , he has this to say in tribute to American schol - arship : `` In some directions , it is true , and particularly in the field of research that we are now concerned with , I wonder whether
America	LOCATION	has not actually outstripped Ger - many herself , after having been her disciple .

		As I was some time ago getting up a small popular book on Chaucer and had to acquaint myself with the most recent critical works on his life and poetry , I was struck by the pre - dominance of Americans in the list of the latest discoverers .

		Foremost in the catalogue were the names of Professors Kittredge ,
Scho	PERSON	- field ,
Tatlock	PERSON	, Root ,
Lowes	LOCATION	,
Young	PERSON	, and others , nearly dispossessing the country of Ten 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	Brink of her former supremacy . ''

		In closing he emphasizes his impression of a prevalent `` admiration and reverence for English litera - ture '' on the part of its students in
France	LOCATION	.

		A PROMISING PROFESSION FOR BOOK-LOVERS who would like to be book-writers , but who somehow , in spite of undeniable skill in the manipulation of pen or typewriter , can not exactly hit it off when it comes to original literary production , has long been found in the pleasant task of handling , for the benefit of other book-lovers , the works of those envied beings who have succeeded in becoming book - producers .

		There is always the possibility , too , that in this close contact with the best that has been thought and said in the world , the contagion of authorship will in some myste - rious manner be caught , with ultimately grati - fying results in renown and royalties .

		Was not the celebrated author of the world-famous `` Critique of Pure Reason '' once employed in this very task of handling the books of others in the
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Konigsberg	LOCATION	?

		And was there not a certain librarian of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and later head of the
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	, who is now even better known for his learned contributions to histori - cal literature than for his noteworthy services to librarianship ?

		Let us then , we who love books and would fain write them also , embrace the librarian 's calling and see what will hap - pen .

		But is it so easy to get a position as libra - rian ?

		Hear what they say about it at one of our largest library schools .

		`` For several years , '' it is reported from
Madison	PERSON	, `` the number graduating from the
Library School of the University	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	-RSB- exceeded the number graduated from any other simi - lar school in the country , '' but with all this annual output `` there never has been the slightest difficulty in obtaining positions for the graduates of the school .

		In
1913	DATE	out of 31 who were graduated 29 had positions at the time of graduation .

		In
1914	DATE	out of 29 who were to graduate 26 had received appoint - ments at graduation . ''

		Could there be any - thing more alluring than the pleasant path leading through this semi-literary profession to all sorts of delightful possibilities in a pro- fession that is wholly literary and supremely soul-satisfying ?

		READING IN
IRELAND	LOCATION	, especially in western
Ireland	LOCATION	, appears to be a pastime not much in - dulged in by people generally , though there is an immense respect for books and those who write them , a respect inversely proportional to the intimacy of acquaintance with things literary .

		Familiarity breeds contempt , as the proverb assures us .

		In `` Castle Rackrent , '' though the mistress of the castle reads `` The Sorrows of Werther , '' her lord and master is far more interested in his own multiplying troubles and difficulties ; and at the present day the Irishman who digs and delves for his livelihood has little time or inclination to go deeply into books .

		A shelf of ancient and well-thumbed volumes is likely to be found in the farmhouse , but the family reading is chiefly confined to `` Old
Moore	PERSON	's Almanack '' and either `` The Irish Weekly Independent '' or `` The Weekly
Freeman	PERSON	. ''

		`` Old
Moore	PERSON	, '' by the way , in his last year 's almanac pre - dicted `` grave trouble in
Europe	LOCATION	about this time . ''

		A writer in the current number of `` The Book Monthly , '' Mr.
Thomas Kelly	PERSON	, to whom acknowledgment is due for various items here noted , reveals the rather surprising fact , if it be a fact , that in the land of their nativity `` Lever and Lover are very rarely seen , though ` Handy
Andy	PERSON	' is to be met with occasionally '' another illustration of the rule respecting prophets in their own country .

		Even Canon
Hannay	PERSON	-LRB- better known as ``
George A.	PERSON
Birmingham	LOCATION	'' -RRB- is rather roughly handled by those who pretend to be competent critics .

		But among the common people of lit - tle book-learning , as already intimated , au - thors and their works are more likely than not to be held in reverence .

		Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	relates an amusing incident in this connection .

		`` I re - member seeing in one house a booklet whose author I knew .

		He lived in the neighbouring town , and I mentioned this fact to ` the man of the house . ' '

		Is it a man that could write a book , ' he queried in no slight surprise , ` to be livin ' in the town o ' Drumdallagh ` ithin ten mile o ' where I stand ?

		Man , oh man , do ye tell me that ?

		Where now would his house be in the town , for I 'll go an ' have a look at the outside o ' it the next day I 'm in at the market . ' '

		INDEXERS ' IDIOSYNCRASIES are often amiable and harmless , and sometimes unamiable and injurious to the interests of index-users .

		A pas - sion for fulness of entry in the case of personal names may cause more consumption of time than is worth while , but no harm is done unless other more important duties are neglected in consequence .

		On the other hand , the scrupu - lous substitution of a little-known real name for a universally-known popular designation may give rise to vexation and bewilderment and smothered -LRB- if not eruptive -RRB- profanity .


Thomas Jonathan Jackson	PERSON	, for example , is known to students of American history as identical with `` Stonewall ''
Jackson	PERSON	, but to the great American public the sturdy general
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 291 is `` Stonewall , '' and not
Thomas Jonathan	PERSON	, and it has a right to expect the nickname to appear in the index or catalogue , as in truth it often though not always does .

		Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	, in a protest published in the
March	DATE	`` Library Journal , '' complains of the misdi - rected scrupulosity of some professional index - ers , and takes occasion to point out a common and rather unwise practice on the part of book-indexers , who for some reason think it necessary to enter in the index the general sub - ject of the book .

		He refers especially to biog - raphies , and cites a real or supposed life of
General Putnam	ORGANIZATION	, the index to which contains such entries as this : `` Putnam ,
Israel	LOCATION	, his en - counter with a wolf , ' ' which should have been : ' '
Wolf	PERSON	,
Putnam	PERSON	's encounter with a. ' ' And he speaks of a recent admirable biography of a famous American that devotes ten solid col - umns of its index to the subject of the book , as if any mortal reader would have the pa - tience to search for a needle in that haystack !

		He might have instanced an even more flagrant recent example : the admirable biog - raphy of
Mark Twain	PERSON	by his authorized biog - rapher gives almost thirteen columns of its excellent index to the entry , `` Twain , Mark . ''

		THE CREATOR OF COLONEL CARTER OF CAR - TERSVILLE was fifty-three years old when this product of his invention placed h.im in the front rank of those who have delineated the Old South felicitously in fiction .


Francis Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	, a descendant of that gifted
Francis Hopkinson	PERSON	who immortalized himself by affixing his signature to the Declaration of Independence , was born
October 23 , 1838	DATE	, in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and died
April 7 , 1915	DATE	, in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Early reverses in the family fortunes forced him to shift for himself with little of the educational equipment accounted neces - sary for a fair start in life .

		A clerkship in his brother 's iron works was cut short by the fail - ure of the business , after which came engineer - ing studies in
New York	LOCATION	and the opening of an office as contractor .

		Much constructive work jetties , breakwaters , lighthouses , sea-walls , etc. was undertaken for the government , and a permanent and conspicuous reminder of this phase of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's varied activity is the foundation of the
Bartholdi Statue of Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, as also the
Race Rock Lighthouse	ORGANIZATION	, off New Lon - don , of which its builder was especially proud .

		His vacations meanwhile were largely given to sketching in the
White Mountains	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	, Mex - ico , and later in
Venice	LOCATION	,
Constantinople	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		He had drawn and painted from boyhood , being chiefly self-taught in this form of art .

		At about forty years of age he began to discover his genius in literature , in slight sketches of travel and observation , and later in stories and novels .

		Best known among his long list of books are such favorites as `` Colonel
Carter	PERSON	of
Cartersville	LOCATION	, '' ``
Caleb West	PERSON	, '' `` Oli - ver Horn , '' ''
Peter	PERSON	, ' ' and ' '
Kennedy Square	LOCATION	. ' '

		Wholesome and hearty are these and other romances of his , a little obvious and old - fashioned in their construction , perhaps , but for that very reason , in part , of unfailing acceptability with the great novel-reading pub - lic .

		A more variously gifted novelist it would be hard to name , and his death is more than a grievous loss to literature .

		HEAVY READING in more senses than one was the famous collection of all extant cuneiform literature in the royal library of
Asurbanipal	LOCATION	, king of
Assyria	LOCATION	.

		Baked clay took the place of paper in that formidable assemblage of books , and the total tonnage of the library must have been tremendous .

		But it represented the golden age of Assyrian literature , and so must have possessed other virtues besides mere weight .

		A similar collection , though of much smaller proportions , is that which now has its abode in a room of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	under the careful guardianship of Mr.
Victor Hugo Paltsits	PERSON	, known of old to many obliged readers as the assistant librarian of the now vanished
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	in upper Fifth Avenue .

		In a recent number of the `` Library Bulletin '' Mr.
Paltsits	PERSON	gives some description of the precious collection in his keeping .

		`` The earliest records in the Li - brary , ' ' he says , ' ' are baked-clay tablets , cylin - ders , slabs , etc. , in the Sumerian language , dating from the time of Naram-Sin , son of
Sargon	ORGANIZATION	, about 2600 B. c. ; Gimil-Sin ,
King of Ur	ORGANIZATION	, about 2200 B. c. , and other reigns in Baby - lonia .

		There are also cuneiform inscriptions in the Assyrian language of the reign of Ashur-nasir-pal , King of
Assyria	LOCATION	, 885-860 B.C. , and of Nebuchadressar II. ,
King of Babylon	ORGANIZATION	, 604-561 B.C. , in the Babylonian language . ''

		AN EXILED REVIEW , sharing courageously the lot of many of its former writers and readers , will presently resume its activities under the protection of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Le Museon , '' a long-established quarterly publication devoted to Oriental studies , edited of late by Professor
Philippe Colin	PERSON	et of
Lou	PERSON	- vain
University and Professor L. de la Vallee Poussin of Ghent University	ORGANIZATION	, and published by the former institution , has been taken in charge by the Syndics of the
Cambridge Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press , which is about to issue the de - layed first number of the current year .

		Both
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	have shown generous 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	hospitality to the expatriated academicians of devastated
Belgium	LOCATION	, so that this fortunate rescue of the `` Museon '' from extinction or indefinite suspension is but an extension of previous good offices .

		Whether the future con - tinuation of the review will be possible must depend upon those who give their interest and support to its department of learning .

		Among the announced contributors to the next two issues are such recognized authorities in their several departments as Professor
J. B. Bury	PERSON	, Professor
James Hope Moulton	PERSON	, Professor
E. G. Browne	PERSON	, Dr.
F. W. Thomas	PERSON	, Librarian to the
India	LOCATION	Office , Dr.
Reynold A. Nicholson	PERSON	, Lecturer in Persian at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and Mr.
A. A. Bevan	PERSON	,
Lady Almoner	ORGANIZATION	's Reader in Arabic at the same university .


CANADA	LOCATION	'S CONTRIBUTION TO POLITE LITERA - TURE is greater than is commonly suspected outside of
Canada	LOCATION	, or perhaps inside .

		The
Department of Education	ORGANIZATION	of the Province of
Ontario	LOCATION	issues quarterly `` A Selected List of Books Recommended by the
Ontario Library Association for Purchase	ORGANIZATION	by the Public Libra - ries of the Province , ' ' and the current number contains bibliographies , not aiming at com - pleteness but nevertheless impressive , of
Cana	LOCATION	- dian fiction , poetry , and biography , with a list of Canadian magazines .

		These bibliographies , in which `` titles have been chosen chiefly on the grounds of availability and value , '' fill twenty-two large pages , and are of a nature to commend themselves as aids to librarians beyond as well as within the borders of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pamphlet is obtainable from Mr. ``
Walter R. Nursey	PERSON	, Inspector of Public Libraries ,
Toronto	LOCATION	, though to what extent and on what terms it will be supplied to applicants outside of
Ontario	LOCATION	, we can not say .

		A RENAISSANCE IN YIDDISH LITERATURE to be taking place in the Ghetto of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Present hard conditions in
Europe	LOCATION	have caused a sort of Jewish exodus that may be found to have some points of resemblance , however remote , to the emigration of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	from
Spain	LOCATION	in the
sixteenth century	DATE	, and of the Huguenots from
France	LOCATION	in the sev - enteenth .

		At any rate , the sum of literary and artistic talent on the Continent has been diminished by the self-expatriation of not a few men and women unusually gifted and accomplished , and of these there are some marked instances now attracting attention among the Semitic population of our chief city .

		This incoming tide of talent includes such names , real or pseudonymous , as Scholem Ash ,
Abraham Raisin	PERSON	,
Scholem Aleichem	PERSON	, and
Perez Hirschbein	PERSON	.

		Of the `` Yiddish Mark Twain '' -LRB-
Scholem Aleichem	PERSON	-RRB- appreciative mention has already been made in these col - umns , and the others here enumerated have shown themselves no less skilled in their sev - eral departments of prose and verse , of fiction and drama and well-turned poem .

		Increased means of approach to their readers have been provided for these and other new writers by the starting of additional magazines and other periodical publications in the Yiddish tongue , together with a monthly magazine in English for the publishing of translations from these Jewish authors .

		One of the most interesting figures in this new school of Yiddish writers is Mr.
Perez Hirschbein	PERSON	, the `` poet-wanderer , '' as he has been styled , whose unmetrical me - dium of expression seems well adapted to his thought , and ought not to be summarily dis - missed with the ridicule so often visited upon this form of literature .

		On the whole , it ap - pears not unlikely that in the accession here noted of fresh talent , perhaps even genius , among our writing folk , it may turn out that American literature has been appreciably the gainer , and European literature correspond - ingly the loser .

		AFTER FORTY YEARS OF NOVEL - WRITING , or nearly that , with a record , according to her own account , of sixty novels to her credit , Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr	PERSON	passes into her eighty-fifth year with feelings of calm content as she looks back upon the road her feet have travelled .

		It was not until after the death of her husband and three sons from yellow fever at
Galveston	LOCATION	, in
1867	DATE	, that she , with three daughters depen - dent on her , turned her energies to literature as a means of support .

		Those thirty-six years of her earlier life had certainly not been lack - ing in variety of experience on which to draw in the writing of fiction .

		Born in
Lancashire	LOCATION	, marrying early , and emigrating to this coun - try with her husband ,
Robert Barr	PERSON	, she gained an acquaintance with the ups and downs , the comedy and the tragedy of existence , such as can be claimed by few of our romancers .

		Two years ago , in her notable autobiographic vol - ume , `` All the Days of My Life , '' she said of herself , what she would doubtless now re - peat with no change except in the statement of her age : `` I have lived , I have loved , I have worked , and at eighty-two I only ask that the love and the work continue while I live .

		What I must do , I will love to do .

		It is a noble chem - istry that turns necessity into pleasure . ''

		* ILLINOIS PUBLIC LIBRARIES now number 222 , of which 161 are maintained by taxation , and eleven are endowed but are free to the public .

		This we learn from the current Report of the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 293
Illinois Library Extension Commission	ORGANIZATION	, which leaves unelucidated the exact nature of the fifty libraries unaccounted for in the fore - going .

		Comparison , not unfavorable , is d.rawn with the library equipment of neighboring states ,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	having 167 public libraries ,
Indiana	LOCATION	145 .


Missouri	LOCATION	39 ,
Iowa	LOCATION	152 .

		Yet the undisputed fact remains , laments the statisti - cian , that there are still seventeen counties in
Illinois	LOCATION	with no public library , and fifty-two cities , of two thousand or more inhabitants , also lacking in this important respect .

		COMMUNICATION .

		`` THE DOCTOR '' AND `` TRISTRAM SHANDY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On opening the first volume of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's '' Doctor , '' and noticing the
delta	ORGANIZATION	with lines from the three angles meeting at the centre -LRB- it is pre - sented later in the text -RRB- , one may or may not think of the astonishing illustrations to
Sterne	PERSON	's ''
Tris	PERSON	- tram Shandy . ''

		But as soon as the reader finds that the first seven chapters run backwards , he can - not but remember how the chapters of the Opinions of Tristram were continually losimg ground as his life progressed .

		Next comes a belated preface , though not so long belated as was
Sterne	PERSON	's .

		Then after the eighth forward-moving chapter there is one of a new sort , the heading of which , '' Inter - chapter I. , '' is given only at the end ; and this recalls the oddity of
Sterne	PERSON	's chapters , e. g. , the empty ones .

		Nor does the mechanical resemblance end here , for -LRB- to pass by
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's various liberties in pointing -RRB- on page 28 a secret is offered to us in a series of groups of stars ; it needs not to mention the use of this device in the early life of Tristram .

		But to pass from these mechanical resemblances to the similarity of style .

		The account which the author of '' The Doctor '' gives of the conception of his book shows him to be a direct descendant of Mr.
Shandy	PERSON	: there is the same nonchalant descrip - tion , the same scrappiness of conversation .

		But really the best way to illustrate is to quote the first paragraph : '' I was in
the fourth night	DATE	of the story of the Doctor and his horse , and had broken it off , not like Scheherezade because it was time to get up , but because it was time to go to bed .

		It was at thirty - five minutes after ten o'clock , on the
20th of July	DATE	in the year of our Lord
1813	DATE	.

		I finished my glass of punch , tinkled the spoon against its side , as if making music to my meditations , and having my eyes fixed upon the
Bhow Begum	PERSON	, who was sitting opposite to me at the head of her own table , I said , ' It ought to be written in a Book ! ' ''

		And
Sterne	PERSON	's style in addressing his reader , best remembered from his charge to the reader to go back and re-read so as to pick up a lost point , has also been caught by the author of '' The Doctor , '' at first , it must be remembered , an anonymous author .

		He says , almost at the end of the first volume : '' Reader , you may skip this preliminary account if you please , but it will be to your loss if you do ! ''

		In the material used , the two books resemble one another unmistakably . ''

		The Doctor '' is as full of quotations as `` Tristram Shandy , '' quotations from the most surprising sources ; but of course all the quotations are attributed to their authors , and so when
Burton	PERSON	is used in the later work -LRB- vi. , 227 -RRB- his name is given with high praise .

		Yet no one could find in
Southey	LOCATION	that clever use of the material which seems to justify
Sterne	PERSON	's unac - knowledged appropriation :
Southey	PERSON	's product is a pretty heavy one .

		But , it may be asked , what about those incidents of
Sterne	ORGANIZATION	's which have been the subject of so much reproach and so much apology ?

		Surely
Southey	PERSON	could not !

		Two of the incidents in '' The Doctor '' would shock the present taste quite as much as most of those in '' Tristram Shandy . ''

		Both of them are neatly im - plied , full preliminary description and then clever hints .

		The author shows his relish for them , however , in a more honest way than his earlier model .

		After the first , an adventure of the Doctor 's boyhood , the author in a conversation with Miss Graveairs -LRB- chap , xix . -RRB-

		justifies his previous chap - ter : she may banish
Tristram Shandy	ORGANIZATION	as well as
Smollett	PERSON	, Fielding , and
Richardson	PERSON	, but she must not banish the Doctor !

		The other notable incident is of the origin of Nobs , the Doctor 's horse , told with a capital comical-serious air .

		But when we are half way through the next volume , we are given a '' Chapter Extraordinary , '' in which we are told that a certain club has excised a chapter in vol - ume four , and that the author is accused of '' lese delicatesse '' or '' tum-ti-tee . ''

		The author 's defence is remarkably amusing , not least so in the introduc - tion of the name of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	, a common trick throughout the book .

		One reference to
Sterne	PERSON	has already been given , and there are several others .

		The bohemian con - versation between my Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim is quoted -LRB- iv. , 376 -RRB- and later referred to -LRB- v. , 313 -RRB- .

		Here is a frank confession of the author 's taste -LRB- v. , 163 -RRB- : '' I will tell thee however , good reader , that the word itself , apart from all considerations of its mystical meaning , serves me for the same purpose to which the old tune of
Lilli	PERSON	- burlero was applied by our dear Uncle Toby , our dear Uncle I say , for is he not your Uncle Toby , gentle Reader ?

		yours as well as mine , if you are worthy to hold him in such relationship ; and so by that relationship , you and I are Cousins . ''

		Our Uncle 's tune is mentioned once again -LRB- vi. , 361 -RRB- .

		In another place
Southey	PERSON	says he agrees with Mr.
Shandy	PERSON	in disliking short noses -LRB- v. , 231 .

		cf. vii. , 489 -RRB- ; why does he not mention him again in the consideration of Onomantia and Arithemomantia -LRB- vi. , 86 -RRB- or that of Christian names -LRB- vii. , 249 -RRB- ?

		A quotation from
Sterne	PERSON	's Sermons -LRB- vi. , 247 , also vii. , 181 -RRB- , and a criticism of his carrying his secular style into the pulpit , will serve to show how much more steady
Southey	PERSON	's judgment was than
Sterne	PERSON	's .

		Thus are we brought around to notice the vigorous and stable views of life which make up a large part of '' The Doctor '' ; while such ` views are not to be found in '' Tristram Shandy . ''

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	FRIENDLY JJETTERS OF A WANDERING NATURALIST .

		*
John Muir	PERSON	's autobiography , brief and in - complete though it unfortunately is , has traced for us in delightful fashion the gifted Scottish lad 's development under the dis - cipline of a harsh but salutary schooling , and no reader of that book can have failed to hunger for further chapters in continuation of its fascinating story .

		Those chapters can now never be written by the same hand that penned the earlier ones , but a partial substi - tute for them is offered in a collection of `` Letters to a Friend '' covering the years 1866-79 .

		But it is incorrect to speak of these letters as covering the
thirteen and a half years	DATE	over which they are scattered .

		The writer was too much interested in the won - ders of the world he roamed so extensively to spare time for describing his travels in any detail .

		It is , however , this very impatience of the drudgery of writing that causes him to pack into what he does write as much signifi - cance as the words can well convey .

		Poverty of thought is the last fault that will be charged against him .

		Hence the unusual readability , not to say charm , of these brief letters , filling in all not quite two hundred uncrowded pages .

		They were written in the impressionable years of early manhood , soon after their writer had completed his four years of unpre - scribed studies at the
University of Wiscon	ORGANIZATION	- sin and had , as he picturesquely expresses it in his autobiography , `` wandered away on a glorious botanical and geological excursion , which has lasted nearly fifty years and is not yet completed , always happy and free , poor and rich , without thought of a diploma or of making a name , urged on and on through endless , inspiring , Godful beauty . ''

		As to the fortunate receiver of these random letters by the way , the reader is informed in a brief prefatory note that `` when
John Muir	PERSON	was a student in the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	he was a frequent caller at the house of Dr.
Ezra S. Carr	PERSON	.

		The kindness shown him there , and especially the sympathy which Mrs.
Carr	PERSON	, as a botanist and a lover of nature , felt in the young man 's interests and aims , led to the formation of a lasting friendship .

		He re - garded Mrs.
Carr	PERSON	, indeed , as his ` spiritual mother , ' and his letters to her in later years are the outpourings of a sensitive spirit to one * LETTERS TO A FRIEND .

		who he felt thoroughly understood and sym - pathized with him .

		These letters are therefore peculiarly revealing of their writer 's person - ality .

		Most of them were written from the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	, and they give a good notion of the life
Muir	PERSON	led there , sheep-herding , guiding , and tending a sawmill at intervals to earn his daily bread , but devoting his real self to an ardent scientific study of glacial geology and a joyous and reverent communion with Nature . ''

		It is not surprising to find that one who as a boy had so wonderful a knack at inventing `` machines for keeping time and getting up in the
morning	TIME	, and so forth , '' was not lack - ing , when it came to letter-writing , in the literary devices that impart liveliness and character to the written word as will ap - pear from such selections as available space will here allow the reviewer to reproduce .

		As a continuation of what we already know from
Muir	PERSON	's own story of his native skill in devis - ing and fashioning all sorts of strange and more or less useful mechanical contrivances , the very first letter in the book , showing the young man as a factory hand somewhere in western
Canada	LOCATION	, is of interest .

		He writes : '' I have been very busy of late making practical machinery .

		I like my work exceedingly , but would prefer inventions which would require some artis - tic as well as mechanical skill .

		I invented and put in operation a few days ago an attachment for a self-acting lathe , which has increased its capacity at least one third .

		We are now using it to turn broom-handles , and as these useful articles may now be made cheaper , and as cleanliness is one of the cardinal virtues , I congratulate myself in hav - ing done something like a true philanthropist for the real good of mankind in general .

		What say you ?

		I have also invented a machine for making rake-teeth , and another for boring for them and driving them , and still another for making the bows , still another used in making the handles , still another for bending them , so that rakes may now be made nearly as fast again .

		Farmers will be able to produce grain at a lower rate , the poor get more bread to eat .

		Here is more philan - thropy ; is it not ?

		I sometimes feel as though I was losing time here , but I am at least receiving my first lessons in practical mechanics , and as one of the firm here is a millwright , and as I am per - mitted to make as many machines as I please and to remodel those now in use , the school is a pretty good one . ''

		From
Canada	LOCATION	to
Indiana	LOCATION	, thence to Wis - consin , thence again to
Florida	LOCATION	and
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Panama	LOCATION	and elsewhere in the South , and finally to
California	LOCATION	and the beloved home of mountains and glaciers and other manifesta - tions of untamed nature , we follow the eager and adventurous young scientist , finding him more nearly stationary for a considerable
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 295 period in the Yosemite than at any previous stage in his journeyings .

		As exhibiting powers both of observation and of description , as well as a fine artistic sense , the following from this paradise of scenic delights is note - worthy : '' ' The Spirit ' has again led me into the wilder - ness , in opposition to all counter attractions , and I am once more in the glory of the Yosemite ... I wish you could have seen the edge of the snow - cloud which hovered , oh , so soothingly , down to the grand Pilot Peak brows , discharging its heaven-begotten snows with such unmistakable gentleness and moving perhaps with conscious love from pine to pine as if bestowing separate and independent blessings upon each .

		In a few hours we climbed under and into this glorious storm-cloud .

		What a harvest of crystal flowers and what wind songs were gathered from the spiry firs and the long fringy arms of the Lam - bert pine !

		... After making a fire with some cedar rails , I went out to watch the coming-on of the darkness , which was most impressively sub - lime .

		Next morning was every way the purest creation I ever beheld .

		The little flat , spot-like in the massive spiring woods , was in splendid vesture of universal white , upon which the grand forest - edge was minutely repeated and covered with a close sheet of snow flowers . ''

		Though lacking metre , this is as good as
Lowell	PERSON	's poem , `` The First Snow-Fail , '' and in the next paragraph the writer surpasses
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	in originality -LRB- though not always in beauty -RRB- of imagery when he adds : `` The common snow flowers belong to the sky and in storms are blown about like ripe petals in an orchard .

		They settle on the ground , the bot - tom of the atmospheric sea , like mud or leaves in a lake , and upon this soil , this field of broken sky flowers , grows a luxuriant carpet of crystal vegetation complete and ripe in a single night . ''

		But such scenes as these beguiled him into no merely passive contem - plation of their charms .

		The lure of the moun - tains beckoned him forth , and he went with alacrity .

		In another letter from the same region we read : '' I have climbed more than twenty-four thou - sand - feet in these ten days , three times to the top of the glacieret of Mt.
Hoffman	PERSON	, and once to
Mts	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lyell and
McClure	PERSON	.

		I have bagged a quantity of Tuolumne rocks sufficient to build a dozen Yosemites ; stripes of cascades longer than ever , lacy or smooth and white as pressed snow ; a glacier basin with ten glassy lakes set all near together like eggs in a nest ; then
El Capitan	ORGANIZATION	and a couple of Tissiacks , canons glorious with yellows and reds of mountain maple and aspen and honey - suckle and ash and new indescribable music im - measurable from strange waters and winds , and glaciers , too , flowing and grinding , alive as any on earth .

		Shall I pull you out some ?

McClure	ORGANIZATION	with glassy emerald flesh and singing crystal blood all bright and pure as a sky , yet handling mud and stones like a navvy , building moraines like a plodding Irishman .

		Here is a cas - cade two hundred feet wide , half a mile long , glancing this way and that , filled with bounce and dance and joyous hurrah , yet earnest as tempest , and singing like angels loose on a frolic from heaven ; and here are more cascades and more , broad and flat like clouds and fringed like flowing hair , with occasional falls erect as pines , and lakes like glowing eyes ; and here are visions and dreams , and a splendid set of ghosts , too many for ink and narrow paper .

		Pathetic is the earlier record of an accident that threatened to incapacitate its victim for seeing with full enjoyment such sights as those just described .

		An injury to the right eye in those days of work with machines gave Mr.

PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	, .

		PRAISE OF WAR .

		* Professor
Cramb	PERSON	's book on ``
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, '' published
last fall	DATE	, aroused such interest that it has been deemed worth while to reprint a course of lectures he delivered in
1900	DATE	, under the stimulus of the Boer war .

		The style and general purpose so closely resemble those of the other book , that much of what we said in THE DIAL of
October 16	DATE	last is equally applicable here .

		We are , in fact , impressed with the idea that Professor
Cramb	PERSON	's intellec - tual activities revolved around a single great central postulate , which for all practical pur - poses he treated as an axiom .

		A close student of recorded history , with all its distortion of the true facts of human development , he had come to see in Empire the consummation of * ORIGINS AND DESTINY OF IMPERIAL

April 15	DATE	man 's destiny , and in war the means whereby the highest good might be attained .

		Thus he viewed the modern world through ancient spectacles , and interpreted it according to his vision .

		As an extraordinarily able exposition of his particular point of view , one which is widely shared and is very largely responsible for the present war , the work is highly signifi - cant .

		As a revelation of truth or a contribu - tion to progress , it appears to have only a negative value .

		It would be altogether unjust to Professor
Cramb	PERSON	to fail to recognize that he was essen - tially an idealist , and therefore far removed from those who would extend the bounds of Empire or wage war for mere material gain .

		After vehemently declaring that the South African war was being waged for ideal ends , for the good indeed of those to be conquered , he refers to another theory in these terms : '' To assemble a host from all the quarters of this wide Empire , to make
Africa	LOCATION	, as it were , the ren - dezvous of the earth , for the sake of a few gold , a few diamond mines , what language can equal a design thus base , ambition thus sordid ?

		... No man can believe that ; no man , save him whose soul faction has sealed in impenetrable night !

		The imagination recoils revolted , terror-struck .

		Great enterprises have ever attracted some base adher - ents , and these by their very presence seem to sully every achievement recorded of nations or cities .

		But to arraign the fountain and the end of the high action because of this baser alloy ?

		To impeach on this account all the valour , all the wisdom long approved ?

		Reply is impossible ; the thing simply is not British . ''

		On the positive side , the eloquent descrip - tion of
Britain	LOCATION	's mission as a world ruler , with its acceptance of responsibility for the good of the ruled , can hardly fail to awaken some sym - pathetic response : '' But a greater task awaits
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Among the races of the earth whose fate is already dependent , or within a brief period will be dependent upon
Europe	LOCATION	, what empire is to aid them , moving with nature , to attain that harmony which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	dis - cerned ?

		What empire , disregarding the mediaeval ideal , the effort to impose upon them systems , rites , institutions , creeds , to which they are by nature , by their history , by inherited pride in the traditions of the past , hostile or invincibly opposed , will adven - ture the new , the loftier enterprise of development -LSB- developing ? -RSB-

		all that is permanent and divine within their own civilizations , institutions , rites and creeds ?

		Nature and the dead shall lend their un - seen but mighty alliance to such purpose !

		Thus will
Britain	LOCATION	turn to the uses of humanity the valour or the fortune which has brought the religions of
India	LOCATION	and the power of Islam beneath her sway .

		... With us , let me repeat , the decision rests , with us and with this generation .

		Never since on
Sinai God	ORGANIZATION	spoke in thunder has mandate more imperative been issued to any race , city , or nation than now to this nation and to this people .

		And , again , if we should hesitate , or if we should decide wrongly , it is not the loss of prestige , it is not the narrower bounds we have to fear , it is the judgment of the dead and the despair of the living , of the inarticu - late myriads who have trusted to us , it is the arraigning eyes of the unborn . ''

		On the other hand : '' The earthly Paradise of the social reformer , a Saint
Simon	PERSON	or a
Fourier	ORGANIZATION	, of a world free from war and devoted to agriculture and commerce , or of the philosophic evolutionist of a world peopled by myriads of happy altruists bounding from bath to breakfast-room , illumined and illumining by their healthy and mutual smiles , differs from the earlier fancies of Asgard and the Isles of the Blest , not in heightened nobility and reasonableness , but in diminished beauty and poetry . ''

		Thus the tables are turned upon us , and we find ourselves appearing as the apostles of material good , ease , or inanity ; while Mars stands out as the great idealist , and he who will not kill may not himself possess life in any true sense .

		It is the art of the conjurer , of the skilled lawyer , eagerly presenting that part of the case to which the jury must assent , then passing rapidly to a conclusion , ignoring the non sequitur , and skilfully fooling the untrained audience , not nimble-minded enough to detect the break in the chain .

		In the case of Professor
Cramb	PERSON	, however , the deception is doubtless unconscious , and the author of the trick has succeeded in deceiving himself .

		What are the actual facts in the case ?

		It is true , in a large sense , that the British Empire has been and is in a multitude of ways a benefi - cent institution ; largely because it has put down war and the petty struggle for dominion within its boundaries .

		* Most of us believe , and have constantly in our minds at the present time , that the ideals of the existing
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race are the best , the most workable , yet evolved by any people in the world .

		We recog - nize , of course , that still better ideals lie in the lap of the future , inform the minds of the most progressive , and tinge the thought of multitudes who do not consciously hold them .

		Even these , however , seem to
spring	DATE	out of the civilization we have , though they may imply great changes in some of our major activities .

		Each one of us , then , is in a sense the soldier of an empire of thought which we desire to see dominate the world .

		In many respects , we are more aggressive , less modest , than Profes - sor
Cramb	PERSON	.

		Humbug is humbug , and error is error , and bacteria are no respecters of ancient religion .

		We propose to ourselves nothing * A few years ago the reviewer was conversing with an educated
Hindu	PERSON	, a fervent apostle of ''
India	LOCATION	for the Indians . ''

		The point was presented , that in pre-British days the people of
India	LOCATION	continually struggled together , and altogether suf - fered greatly .

		Said the Hindu : '' Were the British to go , we should not be so well governed , but we should prefer to govern ourselves , even at the expense of loss of efficiency . ''

		This man , however , represented a governing class .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 297 less than the genuine enlightenment of the world as to the facts of nature and the ascer - tainable natural laws which govern the affairs of man .

		We propose even more than this , namely , such reformation of customs and of conduct as shall meet the requirements of these laws .

		We believe in the struggle for progress ; it seems to us , as it did to Professor
Cramb	PERSON	, that if it were ever to come to pass that mankind had attained everything worth striving for , Nirvana would be the best consummation .

		The postulate is , however , absurd , contrary to all experience and reasonable expectation .

		The very fact that a new generation is constantly appearing on the stage is an eternal guarantee against staleness .

		The extraordinary expan - sion of experience due to modern science does but reveal untold vistas ahead .

		Thus the black bogy of the militarists is as unreal as any with which nurse ever frightened child .

		Then , as to ideals : we may as well frankly recognize that we have an eye on the practical thing , even on the bread-and-butter aspect .

		The revolt in philosophy known as pragmatism must have its parallel in practical affairs .

		The fallacy that all high emotion , all inflation of soul , has some adequate relation to any sort of utility must be abandoned .

		It is the work of the genuinely modern idealist to test all things , to see the consequences of this or that , and act accordingly .

		Thus the man with the microscope and the test-tube , not the man with the gun , has the real power to determine human fate .

		It is not necessary to declare all war wrong .

		Any one of us can imagine a situation in which he would kill a man without hesitation and with little regret .

		Forcible resistance to aggression , and the forcible suppression of dangerous characters , remain as necessary as ever .

		This , however , is a totally different thing from that proposed by Professor
Cramb	PERSON	, namely , the expansion of Empire through war , and a succession of wars to determine which of rival Empires is the most alive .

		That is the ancient fallacy , founded in a classical education and the distorted presentations of historians , which we must do \ vn before any real democracy is possible .

		The root of the trouble , as we said before , is educational , and the question now is whether the modern teacher can rise to meet the need and the opportunity .

		At present , on the whole , his efforts seem quite inadequate .

		As for the British Empire , everything indi - cates that it is going forward along a true path of progress , of free cooperation , governed by like ideals , not by force .

		This means political disintegration , increasing local au - tonomy , and special developments suited to local conditions .

		The
United States	LOCATION	, by lan - guage and by customs , is necessarily part of the whole great plan .

		We quite agree with Professor
Cramb	PERSON	that a momentous decision awaits our race ; but it is not , we hope , to be made in the sense he desired .

		The real ques - tion is whether we can develop individuals and groups of individuals to the best expres - sion of their peculiar powers , without in - fringement on the rights of other like persons and groups .

		Can we exercise that eternal vigilance , in this case principally over our - selves , which is the price of liberty ?

		If this is possible , we need no longer ask ourselves whether
England	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	or
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, or
China	LOCATION	is to rule the world in the days to come .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		FANTASTIC SOLUTIONS OF SOME SHAKESPEAREAN CRUXES .

		* Having read , in the publishers ' advertise - ment , of Mr.
Charles D. Stewart	PERSON	's `` astound - ing success '' in clearing up `` the famous cruxes which have remained unsolved in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , '' `` forty of the most perplexing passages which have heretofore baffled all attempts at explanation , '' we turned eagerly though with misgivings be - gotten by the overloud thunderings in the index and by recollections of former expe - riences to Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's volume and de - voured the first chapter , dealing with the notorious `` runaway 's eyes '' in `` Romeo and Juliet . ' '

		Our disappointment was greater than we had anticipated .

		But undeterred by the author 's wholly unwarranted cocksureness , contempt for his predecessors , longwinded - ness , and other characteristics of juvenility , we faithfully and hungeringly read on .

		Disappointment grew keener and keener as we read , and steadily the conviction shaped itself that here was one of those books that had no other excuse for existence than the gratification of the author 's vanity -LRB- `` ambi - tious ignorance , '' Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	calls it some - where -RRB- and , perhaps , the ill-advised flattery of his friends .

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's book is intended , and can be intended , only for professed
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	scholars ; to others the discussion of some of the most vexatious and probably corrupt pas - sages in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's text is of absolutely no interest .

		Only a Shakespeare scholar is com - petent to deal with such questions ; for the discussion of these problems involves a special * SOME TEXTUAL DIFFICULTIES IN SHAKESPEARE .

		By
Charles D. Stewart	PERSON	.

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		298 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	and thorough knowledge of the text , not only as it is but how it came to be so , of the plays as a whole , of psychology , of Elizabethan English , and of kindred subjects .

		Mr.
Stew	PERSON	- art , we regret to say , not only lacks these qualifications but is obsessed with a desire to prove that all his predecessors lacked common sense and that he alone of all of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's readers possesses the ability `` to follow Shakespeare in his dealings with the deeper currents of human nature . ''

		But if there is any one particular vice of which this latest elucidator of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's text is guilty it is an almost mad desire to vindicate , at all costs , the readings of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, a task that has led him into almost as many absurdities as the number of difficult passages with which he deals .

		To justify this condemnation of Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's methods and results , let us here epitomize and analyze a few of his readings and interpretations .

		In the first scene of `` Antony and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra '' a messenger enters the presence of the lovers and this colloquy ensues : `` Mess .

		News , my good lord , from
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Ant .

		Grates me : the sum .

		Cleo .

		Nay , hear them , Antony . ''

		Almost all readers of Shakespeare understand from this that
Antony	PERSON	is irritated at the ar - rival of news from Csesar and
Fulvia	LOCATION	, and that he does not want the messenger to go into details but to give a concise summary of his message .

		But this interpretation is too easy for Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	.

		He says : ''
Antony	PERSON	's words , ' the sum , ' are in answer to
Cleopatra	LOCATION	's foregoing inquiry as to how much he loves her ... -LSB- He -RSB- is beginning to expatiate upon that pleasant theme , -LSB- when -RSB- the messenger arrives and interrupts him ... ' The sum , ' he begins , but is again interrupted .

		The line should be printed with a dash after it to indicate that he has begun a sentence which is broken off . ''

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's arguments for his emendation of the accepted text are that the messenger does not immediately answer , that
Antony	PERSON	seems Kot inclined to listen to him , and that Cleopatra enjoins her lover to `` hear them . ''

		But all this shows a complete failure on the part of Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	to understand this simple passage , or to enter into the feelings of the characters .

		Antony , conscious of guilt and apprehending the nature of the news , and knowing that he must hear it , wants the dis - agreeable matter disposed of as quickly as possible .

		Besides , he does not want to show Cleopatra that he is afraid to hear the news from
Rome	LOCATION	in her presence .

		Impatiently and f rowningly he asks for the news in a nutshell ; whereupen
Cleopatra	LOCATION	, womanlike , knowing what is passing through his mind , finds here an excellent opportunity to test the true quality of his love and , pretending to be un - concerned , she says in effect : ' ' Nay , give heedful ear to the messenger . ''

		And thus this woman of infinite variety , whose mere presence is a challenge to her lover to hear his wife 's message , taunts him into not hearing it .

		Much of this would have been clear to Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	had he remembered , or known , that `` to hear '' was often employed by the Elizabethans in the sense of `` to listen pa - tiently and attentively . ''

		Besides , would Shakespeare ever have been guilty of making Antony do anything so superfluous and so commonplace as to attempt `` to tell the amount of his love '' just after he had said `` there 's beggary in the love that can be reckon 'd '' ?

		Hamlet , meeting a Norwegian Captain at the head of some troops marching through
Denmark	LOCATION	, inquires whether these extensive and fatal preparations had for their object the conquest of
Poland	LOCATION	, and is told '' We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name .

		To pay five ducats , five , I would not farm it . ''

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	objects to the punctuation of the last verse .

		He says that according `` to the generally accepted interpretation the Captain is supposed to be saying that he would not undertake to farm it to make a total profit of five ducats , and to be repeating the ` five ' sim - ply to impress that amount on Hamlet 's mind .

		But this is to miss the whole sense and spirit of the line . ''

		After some platitudinous comments on the nature of capital , he comes to the conclusion that the line should be printed `` to pay five ducats five , '' because `` an investment with no result but to pay five ducats five would be the reductlo ab - surdum -LSB- sic -RSB- of investment . ''

		In other words , it would be absurd to invest five ducats if the venture did not result in a profit .

		A better illustration of a simple passage dis - torted beyond recognition we could not find in a
summer	DATE	's day , or a better example of the author 's perverse method of studying Shake - speare , of his unfair dealing with his prede - cessors , of his utter inability to shed light on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and of his skill in smelling out cruxes where no one else ever suspected that any lurked .

		We challenge Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	to name a single editor , critic , or commentator who gives the above-quoted paraphrase of the Captain 's words .

		To every ordinary intelli - gence the Captain says exactly what the situa - tion demands ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that the patch of ground for which they are going to fight and for which so many valiant men are ready to lay down their lives is so insignificant per se that
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 he would not pay five ducats , not even five , a year for the privilege of farming it and taking the revenue from it .

		The `` five '' is repeated to emphasize his contempt for it .

		Let us now turn our attention to a passage which does really present some difficulties to the critics , although it is not generally classed among the cruxes .

		After the fortune-hunting
Bassanio	PERSON	had luckily chosen the prize casket , Gratiano asks his consent to be married too .

		`` With all my heart , '' says the happy Bas - sanio , `` so thou canst get a wife . ''

		Gratiano replies : '' I thank your lordship , you have got me one .

		My eyes , my lord , can look as swift as yours : You saw the mistress , I beheld the maid ; You loved , I loved ; for intermission No more pertains to me , my lord , than you . ''

		Most modern scholarly editions of `` The Mer - chant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' print this passage as we have here given it .

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	, however , with a few modern editors , proposes to read the last two verses as follows : '' You loved , I loved for intermission .

		No more pertains to me , my lord , than you . ''

		His interpretation of the passage is unique .

		After a long discussion he comes to this con - clusion -LRB- p. 177 -RRB- : '' What Gratiano means by this last line must be evident enough .

		It is simply his way of saying , by way of graceful compliment -LSB- Gratiano graceful and complimentary ! -RSB-

		, that he has not gone outside of
Bassanio	LOCATION	's household for a wife .

		When Bas - sanio won
Portia	LOCATION	, her household was annexed to his own , and this included the maid
Nerissa	PERSON	-LSB- Nerrissa a maid ! -RSB-

		; thus the one who pertains in so momentous a relation to
Gratiano	ORGANIZATION	also pertains to
Bassanio	LOCATION	.

		Gratiano is allowing
Bassanio	PERSON	to guess the truth while he approaches it with these general statements ; and in his large point of view ' no more pertains to me than you , ' there is the fine implication that it has always been thus between them .

		Even in his marriage he has not gone outside of his master 's -LSB- ! -RSB-

		circle of interests ; they are now bound by a further tie . ''

		To our thinking , if there was any such stuff in
Gratiano	LOCATION	's mind it would require not only the astuteness of the proverbial
Philadelphia	LOCATION	lawyer but of the whole
Philadelphia	LOCATION	bar to find it in the words quoted .

		Staunton , whose reading is that championed by our author , gives a far more satisfactory interpretation of the last line , viz .

		: '' I owe my wife as much to you as to my own efforts . ' '

		Satisfied that the words `` No more pertains to me , '' etc. , may stand as an independent sentence , and that it therefore does so , and that it is `` in strict keeping with the speaker 's character , '' Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	concludes -LRB- he is nothing if not logical -RRB- that `` the preceding line is a statement by itself with a full stop after ` intermission . ' '

		And this is how he interprets `` I loved for intermission '' : '' Here Gratiano gracefully acknowledges that his own love affair is quite secondary , in impor - tance , to that of his master .

		It is figuratively referred to as a mere time-filling or stop-gap per - formance , ... a mere side-issue , quite subordi - nate to the main event ... And this is quite in keeping with the self-sacrificing -LSB- ! -RSB-

		and devoted -LSB- ! -RSB-

		character which he upholds . ''

		And this is the interpretation which Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	modestly claims `` settles the mean - ing so positively that there can be no more doubt in the matter '' !

		And , quite true to himself , he again falsifies the interpretations of former commentators .

		He says : `` Those who render the passage so that it reads ` for intermission no more pertains to me than you ' explain it as meaning that
Bassanio	PERSON	was in - cessant in love-making , and that
Gratiano	PERSON	was the same , ... that
Bassanio	PERSON	was always at it and that his man Gratiano was just like him always at it . ' '

		This is a complete mis - representation of
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	's ,
Furness	PERSON	's , and others ' interpretation .


Theobald	PERSON	said that `` intermission '' means `` standing idle , '' and all readers of Shakespeare Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	only excepted understand Gratiano to say `` that he could not be idle , that he had to be doing something , and that as he had nothing else to do he made love to Nerrissa . ''

		And this is certainly preferable to having Gratiano , a gentleman and an intimate friend of Bas - sanio 's , say before
Nerrissa	PERSON	, who is a lady as well born and as well bred as
Portia	LOCATION	, that his love was only a time-filling performance .

		Besides , with Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's punctuation and definition of `` intermission , '' Gratiano is really made to say -LRB- to ordinary intelligences -RRB- that he and his friend loved only as a pas - time , that sincerity in love pertains to him no more than to
Bassanio	LOCATION	.

		With the generally accepted text Gratiano says , in effect : `` You came and saw and wooed , and so did I ; my eyes can look as swift as yours , and I am not a bit ` slower ' than you are . ''

		It must not be inferred from what has pre - ceded that Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's interpretations are always wrong .

		Now and then he is quite right , as , for instance , in the explanation of the word `` ringlets '' in the beautiful verse in the `` Midsummer Night 's Dream '' in which Titania speaks of the fairies dancing their ringlets to the whistling wind .

		Curiously enough , both
Wright	PERSON	and
Furness	PERSON	failed mis - erably in their understanding of this line .


Wright	PERSON	said `` ringlets '' meant the little cir - cular plots of grass known as `` fairy rings . ''

		To this interpretation Dr.
Furness	PERSON	objected , because fairy rings do not grow `` in the beached margent of the sea '' ; in his opinion 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	Titania meant only that the fairies dance to the accompaniment of the whistling wind which meanwhile blows through their curly locks .

		And now Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	assures us that Titania means no more than that the fairies danced in tiny circles .

		The only trouble with this interpretation is that it comes too late .

		Had Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	looked no further than into '' The Century Dictionary '' he would have found this very passage quoted in illustration of the definition `` circles '' for `` ringlets . ''

		Dr.
Chambers	PERSON	, in the `` Arden '' edition of the `` Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' dismisses the whole thing in less than a line , thus : ' ' ring - lets , not curls , but dances in a ring '' ; whereas Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	devotes considerably more than two pages to this bit of old news .

		A better example of Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's fantas - tic and supersubtle method of dealing with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's text than the following can scarcely be found anywhere .

		That celebrated quartet ,
Jackson	PERSON	,
Seymour	PERSON	,
Chedworth	LOCATION	, and
Becket	LOCATION	, whose tamperings with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are living monuments of misingenuity and wasted energy , never perpetrated anything more impossible than Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	in his dis - cussion of this passage in the `` All 's `` Well '' : '' you leaden messengers , That ride upon the violent speed of fire , Fly with false aim : move the still-piecing air That sings with piercing . ''

		-LRB- A. W. , iii , 2 , 111-114 . -RRB-

		`` Still-piecing , '' meaning `` ever-closing , clos - ing immediately , '' is
Malone	PERSON	's generally ac - cepted substitute for `` still-peering '' of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	.

		This almost certain emendation is supported by several passages in Shake - speare which speak of the air as being wound - less , invulnerable , intrenchant , etc. , as well as by the words `` the still-closing waters '' in `` The Tempest . ''

		And
Verplanck	LOCATION	quotes as a very apt illustration of the passage , and as a possible `` source '' for it , the following from the apocryphal book of `` The Wisdom of Solomon '' : `` As when an arrow is shot at a mark , it parteth the air which immediately cometh together again , so that a man can not know where it cometh through . ''

		Besides , `` peering '' is a very likely misprint or mis - reading for `` peecing , '' an Elizabethan va - riant for ' ' piecing . ' '

		This is how Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	wrings a meaning out of the Folio text : `` Peering , as here used , is a verb form of the noun peer , meaning an equal .

		In war -LRB- the present connection -RRB- a man 's peer would be one whom he could not overcome .

		Still-peering air means that the air , despite the leaden missiles that pierce it , is ever unconquered , always unvanquished in - vulnerable ... And so ' still-peering air ' regards the atmosphere as always and ever the equal of these leaden missiles of war , inconquerable , in - vulnerable . ''

		And this is the explanation that , po Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	tells us , makes the passage ' ' as open to sense as any the commonest and plainest English that Shakespeare ever wrote '' !

		It is a pity that our author has omitted to specify to an admiring world in what respect a bullet or leaden messenger of death is invulnerable and unconquerable .

		Hamlet , as we know , is one great crux .

		It might therefore be confidently predicted that one so gifted with a genius for making cruxes , big and little , vanish into thin air as is Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	would surely contribute his mite to the solution of the Hamlet mystery .

		And so he does .

		But he is not content with throwing , a little light on the vexatious questions which we associate with the melancholy Prince ; in a short chapter of twenty-six duodecimo pages printed in large type , he removes Hamlet wholly and for ever from the sphere of the problematical .

		The occupation of the Ham - let commentator is gone !

		We shall quote only a few sentences from this chapter , leaving it to the curious to read more in the original : '' Strange ' inconsistencies ' arise to puzzle the commentators .

		All these are easily explainable .

		We can not , however , make the least progress in the understanding of the true inwardness of the play until we have realized that
Hamlet	LOCATION	is a man who has been incapacitated to have emotion ... To witness a display of emotion upon the part of others was a torture to him because it reminded him of the faculty which he had lost .

		It made him feel poignantly the difference between himself and other men , a terrible state of isolation ; and not only that , it confronted him continually with a live contrast between his former self and the man he had now become ... He makes a grand effort at passionate feeling ... Hamlet lives in the cold light of reason , bereft of all other relief , -LSB- and -RSB- is quite at home in a deep , canny piece of detective work ... The most tragic phase of his situation in life to be a dead self ... His emo - tions are but a memory ... The whole world outfaced Hamlet because his insights had placed him in a terrible isolation ; he was a man apart from the race ... Hamlet was haunted by his dead self ... Hamlet is not a mystery . ''

		Had Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	devoted himself to the study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, English grammar , and psychology , with half the zeal that he has devoted to discovering cruxes and to distort - ing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's meaning , he would not have been guilty of many of the lesser errors that mar his book .

		There is no excuse for speak - ing of Gratiano as
Bassanio	PERSON	's `` man , '' of Nerrissa as a `` maid '' -LRB-
Gratiano	ORGANIZATION	's `` maid '' differs in meaning from Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's -RRB- , of
Bassanio	PERSON	as
Gratiano	ORGANIZATION	's `` master . ''

		And one has read his `` Romeo and Juliet '' very super - ficially who speaks of the masked ball in Act i. , Scene 5 , as a `` wedding feast . ''

		OLD MAGIC IN A XEW CEXTURY .

		* It is not uncommonly remarked that the new magic of a scientific age transcends the wonder of the old magic of a time outworn .

		The miracles of wireless telegraphy and radio - activity , though fast becoming commonplaces of efficiency , still retain a place of honor among amateurs .

		The assumption , however , that the Old Magic has actually passed , that it has utterly faded out before the new sun , is de - cidedly unwarranted by the facts , especially the bibliography of the last few years .

		The activities of the Psychical Research So - ciety do not so much constitute a new science as they aim to investigate some of the material of ancient magic .

		The Spiritualist Societies ,
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, Theosophy ,
Swedenborgian	PERSON	- ism , all these have more than a trace of sorcery in them .

		The revival of Buddhism is significant .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, ultra-modern though he is in '' Our Eternity , ' ' exhibits him - self as a spiritual atavist in `` The Unknown Guest . ''

		Such books as
Bayley	PERSON	's `` Lost Lan - guage of Symbolism , '' Jacks 's `` All Men Are Ghosts , '' and
Rohmer	PERSON	's `` Romance of Sor - cery '' speak eloquently of the vitality of the Old Magic .

		Indeed we are not sure but that Pragmatism has been quietly insinuating a kind of philosophical apology for the pre - sumably unscientific .

		`` The Romance of Sorcery '' is written not for the adept , not even for the student , but for Everyman , the aim being `` to bring out the red blood of the subject . ''

		This the author has succeeded in doing , despite the difficulties in his path .

		The enormous mass of erudition that he must have investigated is appalling , and it is therefore not surprising that the book leaves the impression of a scrappy his - tory of palaeontology , with vast ages unrepre - sented .

		The author 's attitude toward his task , as also his conception of his work , has undeniably the defects of its virtues .

		Be - * THE ROMANCE OF SORCERY .

		By
Sax Rohmer	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		lieving that enough serious essays and his - tories and enough lives of great magicians have been written , he aims at romance , the dramatic , the pathetic , even the humorous .

		Not himself an adept , he is thoroughly recep - tive to the facts of sorcery , and sympathetic toward all the characters he presents .

		Though he tries hard to be fair , and speaks in a re - strained and guarded tone which at times is exceedingly effective , the absence of direct citation of authority , especially in the earlier chapters dealing with the birth of sorcery , `` ginns , '' `` sibyls , '' '' elementals , '' oriental oracles , and so forth , can not fail to arouse suspicion in the mind of a reader with the slightest critical turn .

		References are always of the most general nature ; there are no foot - notes , no citation of chapters or pages .

		Some - times he tells us , sometimes he leaves us to guess , the name of the author upon whom he relies ; Philostratus presumably provides the information concerning Apollonius of
Tyana	LOCATION	, but it would be more satisfactory to know just where to look for confirmation of the story of the raising of the Roman maid from her funeral bier .

		Historical romances have been commonly condemned as neither good history nor good fiction , and in like manner Mr.
Rohmer	PERSON	may tread on his own toes .

		His pur - pose is not solely or even largely entertain - ment ; he aims to persuade .

		And persuasion rests upon conviction .

		In the first chapter , `` Sorcery and the Sor - cerers , '' there is much curious information concerning
Eliphas Levi	PERSON	, who `` may justly be called the last of the sorcerers , '' and his `` Magical Ritual '' ; also the famous `` Magus or Celestial Intelligencer '' by
Francis Barrett	PERSON	.

		Of Apollonius of Tyana the author says : `` There is so much of the marvellous in the life of the man of
Tyana	LOCATION	, that if I am to begin by doubting the possession by Apol - lonius of supernatural powers , I can see no end to my doubts other than that of doubting that he ever existed at all . ''

		Certainly this
august	DATE	Pythagorean philosopher , whose re - corded life presents so many analogies to that of Socrates and Jesus , makes a worthy study .

		Michel de Notre Dame , called Nostradamus , represents the magic of the sixteenth century .

		Since there is no life in English of this great wonder-working physician -LRB- 1503-1566 -RRB- , the author devotes considerable space to him in this book .

		The evidence here is more satis - factory , and shows Nostradamus to have been a remarkable divinator .

		His `` Centuries , '' in rhymed quatrains , published in
1555	DATE	, contain many predictions more or less verifiable .

		In
1792	DATE	there was to be a `` revision of cen - turies , '' followed by various reforms by the 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	people .

		This may have been merely a happy guess , but not often is a guess so accurate two and a half centuries in advance .

		The death of
Henry II.	PERSON	, the advent of
Henry IV.	PERSON	, and the execution `` by the senate of
London	LOCATION	'' of
Charles I.	PERSON	are all foretold in fairly unequivocal terms .

		The chequered career of Dr.
John Dee	PERSON	-LRB- 1527-1608 -RRB- , Fellow of
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Lou	PERSON	- vain , and intimate of
Queen Elizabeth	LOCATION	, is handled sympathetically , though with an air of tolerant condescension , for the author thinks Dr.
Dee	PERSON	was very much the dupe of
Edward Kelly	PERSON	, `` the most sinister figure in the annals of alchemistical philosophy , '' the man who claimed to have found the ivory caskets of
St. Dunstan	ORGANIZATION	, containing the red and white powders necessary to the composition of the Philosopher 's Stone .

		Cagliostro appears in entertaining but fairly authentic guise as a man of great accomplish - ments , if lacking the genuineness of
Nostrada	LOCATION	- mus .

		The opinion of Lavater , the physiog - nomist , is cited in conclusion : `` I believe that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	produces a form like his only once in a century , and I could weep blood to think that so rare a production of nature should , by the many objections he has furnished against himself , be partly so much misconceived , and partly , by so many harshnesses and cruelties , have given just cause for offence . ''


Lorenza	PERSON	, the `` Countess , '' moves through the account with a tragic beauty she may not have actually possessed .

		For associating
Madame Blavatsky	ORGANIZATION	with sorcerers the author says he has already been taken to task .

		His answer is that many phe - nomena -LRB- a term which he singularly uses in the sense of `` strange occurrences '' -RRB- con - nected with her career are legitimately in the realms of sorcery .

		Here , of course , we have purely a question of phraseology .

		Soldau , in his `` History of Witchcraft , '' says : `` Sorcery is illegal miracle , and miracle legitimate sor - cery . ''

		Ennemoser says in the preface to his `` History of Magic , '' still excellent even if archaic : ' ' The Fathers of the Church looked upon the heathen oracles , and the heathens on the Christian miracles , as sorcery . ' '

		Mr.
Bohmer	PERSON	chooses to make `` sorcery '' cover the entire field of mystical and super - natural : ' ' By sorcery I understand , and in - tend to convey , all those doctrines concerning the nature and power of angels and spirits ; the methods of evoking shades of departed persons ; the conjuration of elementary spirits and of demons ; the production of any kind of supernormal phenomena ; the making of talis - mans , potions , wands , etc. ; divination and chrystallomancy ; and Cabalistic and cere - !

		monial rites . ''

		It is evident from this that all of what Ennemoser calls true mysticism , `` the direct relation of the human mind to God , ' ' as well as lower and superficial manifestations , true knowledge or vision adulterated with cunning and greed , are considered together as having a common essence .

		This unification of all these phenomena seems to be justified .

		It is the amalgam of false and true , of vision and cunning , of White and Black Art , that makes the whole subject such a mass of contradictions and anomalies .

		For this very reason , also , it is surviving in an age of scientific curiosity .

PERCIVAL BEYER	PERSON	.

		THE CASE AGAINST
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		* It can scarcely be doubted that the most trustworthy and informing books on the pres - ent war have come from the neutral countries , especially from
America	LOCATION	.

		Where passion is not engaged , discernment is inevitably clearer .

		Thus , the keenest studies of the diplomatic preliminaries are from the American writer ,
Beck	PERSON	, and the Italian ,
Ferrero	PERSON	.

		If these men unite in finding a verdict of `` aggression '' against
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, we may be sure it is not owing to national prejudice but sim - ply because the facts are so .

		Indeed , so far as the immediate occasion of the war is con - cerned , the case may be said to be virtually closed .

		Even German newspapers and public speakers are now frequently referring to the struggle as a '' preventive war , ' ' waged by the Fatherland to forestall a possible future at - tack by the Entente powers .

		Among recent American books dealing with
Germany	LOCATION	's part in the great struggle , Mr.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	's ``
Germany Embat	LOCATION	- tled '' is the weightiest , not merely because of its grave tone and solemnly drawn conclusions , but also because it is a unique blending of sympathy for the German people and their aspirations with unqualified reprobation of the motives and methods of the German govern - ment in precipitating the war .

		The son of a German mother , an officer of the
Deutscher Verein	PERSON	in his
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	days , Mr.
Villard	PERSON	has for many years been a close student of German conditions .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 303 man point of view in the introductory pages of his book , and then coldly demonstrates the impossibility of American approval .

		The fail - ure of the insistent propaganda in this country is emphasized and the desirability of our re - torting by a campaign of enlightenment in
Germany	LOCATION	is suggested .

		It would be well if this education might begin at home , and if those German - Americans who have fed them - selves since the war began with the offerings of the `` Staats-Zeitung '' and its colleagues could be induced to read this book .

		But that is perhaps a too fond hope .

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	finds that the menace of Ger - many to modern civilization proceeds from autocracy and militarism .

		His chapter on '' Militarism - and Democracy '' is the clearest exposition we have seen of the way the soldier dominates the civilian in Prussianized Ger - many .

		Militarism as a result of autocracy is the text of Mr.
William Harbutt Dawson	PERSON	's * ' What Is Wrong with
Germany	LOCATION	? ' '

		The writ - er 's answer to his own question may be stated succinctly thus :
Germany	LOCATION	is out of harmony with the rest of the world because , owing to the lack of popular control in her parliament , the government is in the hands of a military clique .

		The author has no difficulty in show - ing that
Germany	LOCATION	has only the semblance of a parliamentary government , that the
Reichs	PERSON	- tag is a mere `` hall of echoes , '' and that the real driving force is the
Federal Council	ORGANIZATION	, ap - pointed by the princes of the various states .

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	is perhaps the best-informed man now writing in English on matters pertaining to certain aspects of German economics and administration .

		In his new book there is some threshing over of old straw , with talk of Treitschke ,
Bernhardi	LOCATION	, and
Nietzsche	LOCATION	; but there is also a vast amount of new information , well documented , concerning the growth of Pan-Germanism as reflected in press and par - liament .

		Not the least interesting chapter contains a list of the bellicose utterances of the
Kaiser	PERSON	, which cumulatively constitute a for - midable refutation of the claim that he has T -RRB- een a man of peace .

		In comparison with Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's book , the slender volume entitled ``
Germany	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, ' ' by Mr.
J. W. Allen	PERSON	of the
University of London	ORGANIZATION	, seems commonplace .

		It appears to have been written in the early stages of the war , and offers nothing new .

		Only its equable temper may be commended .

		Mr.
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	's little book , ^ ` Deutschland iiber Alles , '' is a collection of the utterances of representative Germans in defence of the policies of their country since it went to war .

		It is the compiler 's belief that
Germany	LOCATION	is suffering from an obsession , a collective madness combined of persecution mania and the folie des grandeurs .

		This theory , which is more suggestive than con - vincing , would possess greater cogency if the quoted utterances had not all been made in the heat of passion after the conflict was kindled .

		Certain spokesmen of all the belligerents have said things which they will doubtless regret when calmer days come .

		The late Dr.
Emil Reich	PERSON	, an anglicized Austrian , wrote a book a few years ago to show that
Germany	LOCATION	was suf - fering from megalomania .

		His numerous quotations from books , speeches , etc. , carry some weight precisely because they were not words uttered in haste or fury but were pre - sumably intended at their face value .

		For the same reason , ``
Germany	LOCATION	's War Mania , '' a compilation made in
England	LOCATION	, possesses inter - est as a collection of ante-bellum documents .

		In addition to writers usually quoted , General von der
Goltz	PERSON	and Professor
Delbriick	PERSON	are here put on record in defence of militarism .

		The evolution of the Crown Prince from an innocu - ous nondescript into a rather objectionable jingo is also concisely traced .

		Dr.
Edmund von Mach	PERSON	has rendered the American public a service by translating
Paul Rohrbach	PERSON	's `` Der deutsche Gedanke in der Welt , '' which first appeared in
1912	DATE	and has since gone through many editions .

		The trans - lation bears the title , `` German World Poli - cies , '' and though somewhat `` edited '' for American consumption , reproduces substan - tially the original .

		Rohrbach may be de - scribed as a moderate imperialist .

		Fearing that the world is becoming predominantly Anglo-Saxon , he calls upon his people reso - lutely to assert themselves so that they may not be left out of the reckoning .

		The motive , it is to be observed , is not economic but politi - cal .


Germany	LOCATION	's resources are sufficient , he thinks , to support a population much larger than her present , her trade ought to continue to expand as heretofore , her emigration is negligible , she is even obliged each year to import labor .

		There is , then , no urgent eco - nomic need of expansion .

		But the task to which
Germany	LOCATION	must address herself is that of spreading her language , her civilization and its influences , her Kultur -LRB- to use a word that has lately been soiled by all ignoble use -RRB- , to the ends of the world .

		The author holds this to be a cardinal necessity if
Germany	LOCATION	is not to be recreant to her native strength .

		And for this high destiny colonies and spheres of influ - ence are essential .

		With many of these aspira - tions a neutral may readily sympathize , especially as
Rohrbach	PERSON	, unlike
Bernhardi	PERSON	, does not advocate aggressive warfare .

		He has even a keen eye for German faults .

		Speaking of the 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	failure of his country to placate Poles ,
Danes	LOCATION	, and Alsatians , lie remarks upon the German `` inability to make moral conquests '' for which ' ' the North German character is most to blame . ' '

		There can be no doubt that
Rohrbach	PERSON	rather than
Bernhardi	PERSON	represented the feel - ings of the majority of Germans before the outbreak of the war .

		All the more pity that the government chose the Pan-Germanic path .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Ho for the Spanish Main in the brave days of the buccaneers !

		The ringing call comes to our ears with `` The Gentleman Adventurer , '' by Mr.
H. C. Bailey	PERSON	, a romancer who has proved his quality on several previous occa - sions .

		Here is a pirate story calculated to quicken the most jaded sense and to stir the most sluggish blood .

		It tells of
Peter Hayle	PERSON	, implicated out of good nature in a plot against the life of Dutch William in
1695	DATE	, and making a hasty exit from
England	LOCATION	to save his neck .

		He is shanghaied in
London	LOCATION	, taken to the
West Indies	LOCATION	and sold as a slave , and there , escaping from servitude in the company of a burly ruffian named
Luke Veal	PERSON	, captures a ship , runs up the Jolly
Roger	PERSON	, and carves out for himself piratical fame .

		He is a considerate buccaneer , who never scuttles a ship for the fun of the thing , and his chief exploit is the putting out of business of
Estevan	LOCATION	, a pirate of the most reprehensible sort , whose villainies make
Peter	PERSON	's gorge rise and inspire him with loath - ing .

		Estevan is ruler of a private pirate king - dom on the coast of
Honduras	LOCATION	, and his store of treasure suffices to set
Peter	PERSON	up for life when he returns to
England	LOCATION	and his erstwhile hon - est existence .

		The tale is romantic in the extreme ; the French maiden whom
Peter	PERSON	res - cues is taken home as his wife , while the serpent - woman , the mistress of
Peter	PERSON	and
Luke	PERSON	in their days of slavery , kidnapped by them and wedded to
Luke	PERSON	, seeks to betray her lord and master to
Estevan	LOCATION	, and is properly slain in the ensuing fight , another woman having already appeared upon the scene to fill the place thus made vacant .

		The book has an ingenious fertility of invention , and a raciness of style that is a constant delight .

		In fact , the genuine creative talent of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is bet - ter exhibited by his studies of `` life among the lowly '' by his
Lewisham	LOCATION	,
Polly	PERSON	, and
Kipps	PERSON	than by all his sociological vaticinations and his monotonous criticism of the way in which the world chooses at present to conduct its affairs .

		Bealby is just a small boy of twelve or so , a gardener 's stepson put out to service in the household of a local magnate .

		He goes unwillingly to the scene of his labors , and things begin to happen as soon as he gets there .

		It is something to plunge a toasting-fork into the face of an under-butler .

		but this deed pales into insignificance when the boy , in his pre - cipitate flight from the wrath otherwise to come , upsets the Lord Chancellor -LRB- at that moment a week-end guest -RRB- , and forces from the latter 's lips a word euphemistically de - scribed as ' ' one brief topographical cry . ' '

		The Lord Chancellor has had a rasping experience already , and is not in the best of tempers ; the encounter with
Bealby	PERSON	is the last camel we mean the last straw and hastens his depar - ture from that hospitable roof with anathema in his heart .

		Bealby also thinks it wise to depart , naturally with the utmost secrecy , and thus enters upon a veritable odyssey of adven - ture .

		He attaches himself for a few days to a party of three ladies engaged in a care-free tour of the countryside in a caravan ; then , getting into further trouble , takes a new flight and sets by the ears the population of a neigh - boring town already posted with bills offering a reward for his capture .

		He is finally seized and taken to the Lord Chancellor to explain the innocent cause of the original offending , but his lordship does not believe a word of the confession , and sputters anew the conviction that he has been made the victim of a damna - ble conspiracy .

		Finally ,
Bealby	LOCATION	, much chas - tened , returns to the step-parental roof , and begs to be allowed another chance .

		This rol - licking story has many other elements of interest the romance of the officer and the actress-lady of the caravan , the tramp with whom the boy consorts and eventually `` does , '' and
Lord Chickney	PERSON	, who tries to figure as deus ex machina , and distinctly does not succeed in straightening out the tangle .

		It is all broadly farcical , of course , but it keeps the interest sharpened at every juncture , and the author resists measurably the temptation to digress into social homiletics .

		It was a safe prediction that many months would not pass before Mr.
Will Levington	PERSON	Comfort seized the occasion offered by the world-war for a novel upon that engrossing theme .

		`` Red Fleece '' is not the big work that he might have written had he taken longer
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 about it , or that he probably will give us in the future , but as an impressionistic preliminary sketch it is very acceptable .

		Its hero is an American newspaper correspondent , and its action is upon the Austrian frontier .

		Its bat - tle-pictures suggest to us those of `` The Red Badge of Courage , '' although they are not evolved , as
Crane	PERSON	's were , from the inner con - sciousness of the writer , for Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	has seen war at first hand , and knows all its ghastliness .

		Since this knoAvledge is combined with an intense missionary zeal in behalf of human brotherhood , and deep sympathy for the hapless lives reared only to become Kanonenf utter , Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	's message is de - livered with poignancy and force , and his didacticism is hardly of the censurable sort .

		The habitual mysticism of his treatment of woman is once more exemplified in this novel , and
Berthe Wyndham	PERSON	is a worthy addition to his gallery of consecrated souls .

		Our old friend
Fallows	PERSON	of `` Down Among Men '' reap - pears in these pages , and preaches his good old gospel of the cause of the People .

		As a stylist , Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	has never done better work .

		* l His clothing smelled of death ; and one morn - ing before the smoke fell , he watched the sun shining upon the pine-clad hills .

		That mo - ment the thought held him that the pine trees were immortal , and men just the dung of the earth . ''

		It is not given to many men to write such English as that .

		If Mr.
Willem de Veer	PERSON	, the Dutch author of `` An Emperor in the Dock , '' were to set foot on German soil , we tremble at the thought of what would happen to him .

		The ordinary penalties for lese-majeste would clearly be inadequate , and `` something lingering '' would have to be devised for his special case .

		The title of this book arouses pleasurable anticipa - tions , which are , however , not realized , as the author is evidently an amateur , and his yarn is badly written , and devoid of all probability .

		Such as it is .

		we may recount it in brief out - line .

		Two Englishmen are fishing in
Norway	LOCATION	when the war breaks out , and accept the invi - tation of a Dutch yachtsman to be his guests on th ' e homeward voyage .

		One of the boat 's officers is a German spy , who does his best to cripple the yacht on its way back .

		Presently it encounters a German cruiser , which gives chase , but soon comes to grief when its career is ended by a mine .

		The yacht speeds to the rescue of the survivors , and picks up two drowning men , who are taken aboard .

		One of them is discovered to be `` The Disturber of the `` World 's Peace in propria persona '' ; the other is his devoted attache .

		The distin - guished visitors are locked up , but contrive to break loose from their cabin , and , with the aid of the German spy already mentioned , seek to gain command of the yacht , incidentally com - mitting murder in the attempt .

		An im - promptu court is organized for the trial of the imperial offender , who is obliged to listen to some very plain speaking about his own character , and who , `` with an expression on his face of mingled prussic acid and disdain , '' replies to his accusers with what one of the children in `` The Golden Age '' calls `` horrid implications . ''

		When the subject of his con - duct has been thoroughly inquired into by the court , the decision as to whether he shall be set free or hanged as a pirate is decided in favor of clemency , and he is landed at a Dutch port .

		The treatment of this highly dramatic material is meant to be serious , but it hardly escapes being burlesque .

		The dock in which the case of this Exalted Person is eventually adjudicated will , we imagine , prove an entirely different affair .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Given a good-looking man of
New England	LOCATION	up - bringing , who is afraid of women to the point of avoidance of them , and has no just notion of what to do with them when he has passed the point of avoidance , and '' A Reluctant Adam '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- stands forth in Mr.
Sidney Williams	PERSON	's novel of that name .

		It is a recital of the rather pawky hero 's love affairs , from adolescent spooning down to a suddenly acquired and as suddenly dismissed grande passion which comes to nothing whatever .

		Though there remains a feeling that it serves him right , so brief a time and space are allotted this latter episode in the narrative that a sense of dis - appointment remains .

		The protagonist seems to be a man without either respect for womankind or the code of a gentleman to keep him out of mis - chief , and he deserves to have his punishment made more explicit .

		`` Barbara 's Marriages '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Maude Eadford Warren	PERSON	, has been written with the earnest desire to cast light upon the vast problem of love , in and out of marriage .

		The heroine is of an excellent
Virginia	LOCATION	family that has somewhat gone to seed .

		Her first lover is much her elder , and is killed so soon after marriage that she may be said not to have been married at all .

		Her second lover is as disagreeable a cad as one is likely to meet , who exhibits a supermannish selfishness in his love that makes one wonder why he should have consented to a secret marriage .

		He is duly divorced ; but there is a child to come , of which he is igno - rant .

		The third matrimonial engagement is with a gentleman of
Barbara	PERSON	's own class , a lifelong friend .

		The interest of the book is in the second affair , the last being rather carelessly developed .

		The Union of
South Africa	LOCATION	is intimately treated in Mr.
F. E. Mills Young	PERSON	's '' Valley of a Thousand Hills '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		A young Englishman seeking a 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	new career as manager of a cattle-growing estate , and a daughter of the
Boers	PERSON	with more education than her parents , play the leading parts .

		Much of the laxity of living which crops out where widely differing civilizations meet and mingle on frontiers is written into the narrative .

		The disagreeable part in the story is taken by a young native of English blood who is weak rather than vicious , the hero supplanting him in the affections of the beauti - ful Dutch girl .

		The dramatic climax comes with the uprising of the Hindu coolies in
Natal	LOCATION	, which permits discussion of the racial difficulties almost certain to appear when Asiatics are admitted to Caucasian communities in numbers .

		The book is admirably put together .

		A rare figure is the protagonist of Mrs.
Eleanor Atkinson	PERSON	's `` Johnny Appleseed '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		That the American wilderness a hundred years ago should have given birth to lives of fine self-sacrifice was to be expected ; but here was a man with a sense of social service such as the world is still more than a hundred years away from .

		Jonathan Chap - man was , and must have been , a
New Englander	LOCATION	.

		He conceived the idea of going about through the new settlements of the central west and planting appleseeds , that the children of the pioneers might have the joy of orchards .

		He devoted a life to it , and few lives have been better or more profitably spent .

		Mrs.
Atkinson	PERSON	's pages show much research , and bring to life a figure and a time which should never be forgotten .

		In
America	LOCATION	, such a title as Mr.
Oliver Onions	PERSON	has given his new book , `` Mushroom Town '' -LRB- Doran -RRB- , would mean something in the oil regions , or mining regions , or other newly opened terri - tory , which had grown up in a day , as Okla - homa City did , for example .

		In more leisurely
Wales	LOCATION	, with all the assistance
England	LOCATION	can afford , it takes thirty years or thereabouts to turn the sleepy village of Llanyglo into a lively and popu - lar seaside resort .

		How it was done , and what was the effect upon both early inhabitants and pro- moters , is told with vivacity and discernment .

		Incidentally one learns a good deal about the Welsh people , who have played an astonishingly small part in English fiction hitherto .

		When out of sorts with the world , especially with the world of city-life , such a book as Mr.
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	's '' The Idyl of Twin Fires '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- may be taken as both a sedative and an alterative . ''

		Twin Fires '' is the name n weary instructor in English , escaped to a
New England	LOCATION	hillside farm , gives to his place on the suggestion of a girl doctor of philology who comes to a neighboring boarding-house .

		How the old house is made better and lovelier than new , how the landscape is made beautiful , the garden glorified , and the farm made reasonably productive , consti - tutes half the idyl ; the feminine doctor of philol - ogy provides the better half .

		Given a young American girl of good stock and rustic training and allow an elderly maiden lady of strong will , large means , and excellent social position to take her in tow from purely selfish rea - sons , and '' The Diary of a Beauty '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is likely to come out much as Mrs.
Molly Elliot Seawell	PERSON	records it .

		Her lovely creature had one bad time , but that was when she temporarily lost her good looks ; the world was at her feet the rest of the time , except when she most needed it to be , and then it flatly failed her .

		Beauty , we learn , is more highly prized in
Europe	LOCATION	than in
America	LOCATION	, because of its greater rarity over there .

		As a title , ``
August	DATE	First '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- suggests the war ; but there is nothing about war in its pages , except the war of a soul with itself .

		It is the joint work of Mrs.
Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews	PERSON	and Mr.
Roy Irving Murray	PERSON	, and its chief characters are an anglican curate and an unhappy rich girl .

		The latter has nearly every trouble that can come with wealth , and the former has the cure of her soul through circumstance .

		A difficult prob - lem is permitted to solve itself through details not inherent in the problem itself , and it all ends pret - tily .

		The book gives curates another valid reason for existing .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Handbooks on The new series entitled `` The the art and Art and Craft of Letters '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- promises to be , for the most part , authoritative in text , as it is inex - pensive and attractive in form .

		Four little volumes have already been issued : ' ' Satire , ' ' by Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	; `` History , '' by Mr.
R. H. Gretton	PERSON	; `` The Epic , '' by Mr.
Lascelles Abercrombie	PERSON	; and `` Comedy , '' by Mr.
John Palmer	PERSON	.

		Of these the first is the least satisfac - tory .

		Though often happy in its obiter dicta , as most critical books are these days , it is too offhand , too slight , too vague , and suggests a lack of background .

		Much of it is merely celebration of the author of `` Erewhon , '' whose service to English life and letters may be `` not less great than that of
Boileau	PERSON	to the French . ''

		Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	's study of the epic is much better in all respects : it is closely reasoned , interesting , and sound .

		Regarding epics `` primarily as stages of one continuous development , '' the author discusses the na - ture of the epic from the hoary beginnings to our own day .

		He questions `` whether it is really justifiable or profitable to divide epic poetry into the two contrasted departments of ` authentic ' and ` literary . ' '

		Avoiding rigid definition , he indicates the nature of the epic by noting that `` It must be a story , and the story must be told well and greatly ; and , whether in the story itself or in the telling of it , significance must be implied . ''

		To the process of epic poetry the `` Nibelungenlied '' contributed `` plot in narrative '' ; the `` Argo - nautica '' contributed analytic psychology , and love as one of the primary values of life ;
Virgil	PERSON	, besides heightening old aims and effects , contributed the expression of `` social consciousness '' by celebrating the Roman Em - pire .

		`` In ` Paradise Lost . '

		the development
1915	DATE	-RSB- 307 of epic poetry culminates , as far as it has yet gone . '' ''

		` After
Milton	PERSON	, it seems likely that there is nothing more to be done with objective epic .

		But
Hugo	PERSON	's method , of a connected sequence of separate poems , instead of one continuous poem , may come in here . ''

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's essay on comedy , though less bril - liant than
Meredith	PERSON	's , has wider vision .

		He makes much of the varying sources of laugh - ter .

		`` We laugh , '' he says , `` in different lan - guages . ''

		The essay by
M. Bergson	PERSON	that has attained such a vogue is ' ' based almost entirely upon the comedies of Moliere . ''

		These are comedies of `` social gesture . ''

		They are come - dies of `` la parfaite raison . ''

		But they are not of the same type as English comedy .

		The Englishman `` is incapable of seeing things critically , as a being of simple intelligence , for five minutes together .

		His feelings intrude . ''

		His is the comedy of humor .

		Shakespeare 's `` Troilus '' and `` All 's Well '' are between the two .

		Falstaff is representative of English comedy ; `` Falstaff is not judged : he is ac - cepted ... We are asked to become part of his folly . ''

		`` A national English comedy might conceivably have grown out of
Jonson	PERSON	, humanized by
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		But
Congreve	PERSON	killed the comedy of ` humours ' and the pastoral comedy of pretty feeling , putting in their place something the English have never un - derstood and were unable to continue , ' ' the comedy of manners .

		For the present and the future , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	would have English comic writers put aside purely intellectual comedy as alien to their spirit , and , instead , recreate the comedy of humor .

		Let their model `` be
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's way with
Hermia	LOCATION	and
Rosalind	PERSON	, not
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's way with the ` Precieuses Ridi - cules . ' '

		This is sound advice , and it is needed .

		A capable presentation of the The fallacies of view that military force insures preparedness .

		.

		- !

		/ , i , - , against defeat in war and there - fore against having war at all , is contained in the volume entitled `` Peace Insurance '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Mr.
Richard Stockton	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Of course the writer 's fundamental contention is that the
United States	LOCATION	ought to take out more insurance of this kind than it has done ; though he offers no explanation as to why
Europe	LOCATION	, which has long carried very heavy insurance of this sort , has now so destructive a war upon its hands .

		The book contends that the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	are not a burden during peace , and may if properly managed become paying business institutions ; that however desirable , arbitration , disarmament , or finan - cial pressure offer no prospect of relief from national rivalries ; that the cost of war in lives , misery , and money has been exagger - ated ; that there are many compensations for the horrors of war , and that more has been gained than lost in many wars ; that the sol - dier and sailor are often slandered ; that mili - tary force is not opposed to the interests of the average man ; that our past wars show the need for a definite military policy ; that the recommendations of the
General Staff	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Naval Board	ORGANIZATION	are reasonable and wise .

		Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	deserves praise for the usually dispassionate tenor of his work .

		He shows considerable respect for Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	, whom he pronounces `` the most practical of pacificists . ''

		He has less patience with Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	, whom he considers `` a dreamer '' who is `` apparently better acquainted with the military possibilities of the various nations than are the men who , as professional soldiers , make these matters their life study . ' '

		Follow - ing up this thought of professionalism , Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	declares it unfortunate that civilian bodies -LRB- which must mean the President , the Secretary of War , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, representing the people -RRB- should control our military estab - lishments .

		But he is not at all satisfied with
America	LOCATION	's military past .

		He deplores the impression given by our histories that our soldiers in past wars have shown superiority to the enemy .

		The unhappy result of this teaching is that the nation continues to rely upon volunteers , when the facts of war show that trained troops alone are equal to modern campaigning .

		Our own past military history , says Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	, proves this most conspicu - ously .

		`` Throughout the entire Revolution , the militia continued to run , desert , mutiny , and generally imperil the welfare of the Thir - teen Colonies . ''

		And witness Bull Run , in which the volunteer Union army took flight ; whereas an army of trained troops might have crushed its opponents and ended the war .

		That the victorious Confederate army at Bull Run also consisted of volunteers seems to have escaped the writer 's notice .

		But if Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	is not satisfied with our military past , he is able to secure much comfort and moral support for his cause from utterances by former Presidents -LRB- some of them civilians , by the way -RRB- , especially
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This dependence upon the past is one of the chief points in which those who strive to avert war differ from the militarists .

		The latter see only war in the past ; the civilist -LRB- as the anti- militarist chooses to be called -RRB- sees a continu - ous development of law and order and a corresponding objection to war .

		The militarist finds his warrant in what has been ; the civil - ist in what ought to be and can be if - man will but determine to have it so .

		308 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	Both knowledge and wisdom , both book-learning and acquain - tance with life , speak in the pages of Mr.
Horace J. Bridget	PERSON	's ethical and philosophic and speculative essays grouped under the general title , `` Criticisms of Life : Studies in Faith , Hope , and Despair '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	, English by birth and breeding , but now `` a candidate for the citizenship of this Kepublic , '' as he declares himself , is the leader of the
Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and his book is to be taken as an earnest endeavor to apply the principles of the
Ethical Movement	ORGANIZATION	to the several problems , religious and social and moral , which the vol - ume discusses ; or , in his own words , '' it is in the light of these two principles the princi - ple of Idealistic Naturalism and the principle of the Supremacy of Ethics that I have re - examined the special problems dealt with by the writers and thinkers whose works I have used as texts . ''

		Lest the occurrence of the word `` despair '' in his sub-title should mis - lead , the author explains at the outset that in adducing illustrations of that state of mind `` the purpose has been not merely to criticize the doctrines rejected , but to justify faith and hope by destroying the grounds of their op - posites . ''

		After this and other preliminary remarks the book opens with a study in relig - ious experience , with
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's poem , `` The Hound of Heaven , '' as a text , re-enforced by an abundance of apt illustra - tion .

		Then follow a sharp attack on Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	as a theologian , a scorching criti - cism of Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	's philosophy of the universe , a calmly rational consideration of Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	's famous Presidential Ad - dress , of two years ago , before the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, a critical review of `` The Inside of the Cup , '' | a strong protest against the `` new morality '' advocated in the writings of Miss
Ellen Key	PERSON	and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, an arraignment of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	and Colonel Ingersoll for \ daring to maintain the justifiability of sui - cide in certain circumstances , a panegyric on Captain
Scott	PERSON	, and a brief epilogue on the European war .

		Notable amid other pro- ; nounced features of the book is the author 's | disapproval of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	as an argumen - tative writer ; he is `` the supreme genius of inaccuracy , '' as we are assured more than once , in varying terms , both in the chapter devoted to him and elsewhere .

		But , by a sort of nemesis familiar to those who have studied the habits of that two-edged sword called criti - cism , the critic himself falls into the trap of inaccuracy and exaggeration in the very act of accusing the other of those failings .

		For instance , he speaks of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's aston - ishing and not always admirable productivity thus : ' ' We find him every week in the ' Illus - trated
London	LOCATION	News ' and the
London	LOCATION
` Daily Herald	ORGANIZATION	' ... and almost every month in al - most every magazine '' which is obviously untrue as well as impossible even in the case of that inexhaustible genius .

		In general , how - ever , Mr. Bridges is temperate as well as agreeably readable ; his sanity and sweet rea - sonableness are qualities of which we can not have too much in these days ; and it is to be hoped his book will have the wide reading it so richly deserves .

		Disraeli durin g The revival of interest in the the decade problems ot the British Lmpire , which came in the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	and which has been especially prominent in English politics since the great struggle with the
Boers	PERSON	, has natu - rally turned the thoughts of Englishmen back to the statesman who more than any other Prime Minister strove to enlarge the domin - ions of
England	LOCATION	over the seas .

		It was found to the regret of many that no adequate biog - raphy had been written of
Benjamin Disraeli	PERSON	, that no author had ever attempted to trace the development of the seemingly contradictory principles of his political philosophy .

		A few years ago Mr.
Murray	PERSON	, the English publisher , undertook to bring out such a work , the writ - ing of which was to be done by Mr.
W. F. Monypenny	PERSON	, a young journalist who had achieved great distinction in his profession .

		Two volumes appeared in due time , carrying the narrative down to
1846	DATE	.

		`` When Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	was completing for the press the second volume of this biography his health was rapidly failing , and he died ten days after its publication . ''

		Mr.
George Earle Buckle	PERSON	, at one time editor of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' assisted the author in putting his last volume through the press , and to him the publishers have assigned the task of completing the biog - raphy .

		Volume III. , which has recently ap - peared , is therefore almost entirely Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	's work ; Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	had collected and sifted a large amount of materials , but he left only one chapter completely written an analysis of
Disraeli	PERSON	's novel `` Tancred . ''

		Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	has followed faithfully the plan origi - nally adopted ; to a large extent the docu - ments , as in the earlier volumes , are allowed to tell their own story ; but on the whole , Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	maintains a better proportion between documents and narrative .

		Like his predeces - sor , he writes from a Tory viewpoint .

		The new volume covers the period from
1846	DATE	to
1855	DATE	, the period of
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's rise to leadership
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 309 among the protectionist Tories and of his suc - cessful effort to reshape Toryism along broader conservative lines .

		The most notable feature of Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	's study , aside from a detailed history of protectionism in its de - cline , is his defence of Disraeli against the charge that he was insincere when he came forward as the champion of the corn laws .

		The author believes that he was thoroughly honest in his support of the agrarian interests , but that he regarded protection as an expe - dient , not a principle , and that he abandoned it because he realized that
England	LOCATION	was done with corn laws .

		Lord Derby , who was Dis - raeli 's chief , is treated with some severity ; Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	finds him lacking in foresight and especially in political courage .

		The volume contains some discussion of personal matters , but on the whole it is chiefly a history of Dis - raeli 's activities in parliament and of English politics generally during the period under re - view .

		The original plan was to complete the biography in three volumes ; three have now appeared , and
Disraeli	PERSON	has scarcely been launched upon his great career .

		Unless some different plan is adopted for the remainder of the work , we may look for at least three vol - umes more .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		In his book entitled `` Wild Life ofwiidii?e tion Conservation in Theory and Practice '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
William T. Hornaday	PERSON	has brought together the substance of a series of lectures delivered in
1914	DATE	before the
Forest School of Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Frederic C. Walcott	PERSON	has added a chapter on private game preserves as factors in conservation , and a useful bibliog - raphy of the more recent works on wild birds with special reference to game preserves and the protection and propagation of game .

		Dr.
Hornaday	PERSON	, in his noble fight on behalf of the wild life of
America	LOCATION	, has realized the impor - tance of awakening the interest of the univer - sities . ' '

		What is needed , ' ' he says , ' ' and now demanded of professors and teachers in all our universities , colleges , normal schools , and high schools , is vigorous and persistent teaching of the ways and means that can successfully be employed in the wholesale manufacture of public sentiment in behalf of the rational and effective protection of wild life . ''

		In empha - sizing the vital importance of conservation , from an economic even more than from a sentimental standpoint , Dr.
Hornaday	PERSON	offers encouragement to further effort by setting forth what has already been accomplished by a comparatively small body of earnest-minded men and women .

		This work may be summar - ized as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- seventy per cent of the killing of non-game-birds has been stopped ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the killing of game has been restricted to open seasons , which have steadily been made shorter ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- long close seasons , usually for five years , have been extended to a very few species threatened with local extinction ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the sale of game has been prohibited in seven - teen states ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the importation of wild birds ' plumage for millinery and the use of native birds as hat ornaments have been completely suppressed ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the creation of a large num - ber of national and state game-preserves and bird refuges has been brought about ; -LRB- 7 -RRB- a partial suppression of the use of extra-deadly firearms in killing birds has been effected ; -LRB- 8 -RRB- the enactment of a law placing all our 610 species of migratory birds under the protec - tion of the federal government has been se - cured .

		Dr.
Hornaday	PERSON	's book should do much to widen and deepen the interest in the protec - tion of our wild life , and particularly the saving from imminent extermination of sev - eral important species .

		Confessions of
Frederick the Great	ORGANIZATION	.

		A timely publication is Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's reprint 0f `` The Confessions of Frederick the Great , '' edited by Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	, with a `` Foreword '' by Mr.
George Haven	PERSON	Put - nam , and a translation of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's `` Life of Frederick the Great '' appended .

		If to - day 's interpretation of the `` Confessions '' is different from that which historical criticism would have accorded it a year ago , this dif - ference shows how even criticism must bear its burdens in the face of upsetting facts .

		Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	explains that
Carlyle	PERSON	's `` million words '' are too many for the curious of these days : a smaller book about
Frederick	PERSON	has its place .

		The text of the `` Confessions '' 5s taken from an eighteenth century translation , and one regrets that Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	did not tell us about the text of
Frederick	PERSON	's original , whether it is included in the
Berlin	LOCATION	edition of his works , and what those editors said of it .

		No one can hope to write of
Frederick	PERSON	with authority who has not made himself familiar with that remarkable set of books .

		That Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	is not ignorant of the collected edition is evident in his criticism of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's praise of
Frederick	PERSON	's '' Anti-Machiavell , '' as indicating views long held by
Frederick	PERSON	, pre - sumably after he came to the throne .

		Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	might have added that the `` Anti- Machiavell '' was written before the invasion of
Silesia	LOCATION	gave the lie to all that was genu - inely noble in the earlier writings of the Crown Prince .

		It would be unfair to satisfy curiosity by quoting from the `` Confessions '' ; they are worth reading , and one may duti - 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 15	DATE	fully record a sense of loathing at the doc - trines they reveal .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's `` Fore - word '' prepares the reader for the political purpose of the ' ' Life of Frederick the Great ' ' by
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the work of what one may call the Historian-Laureate of the Hohenzollerns .

		It is small wonder , after the testimony of such foreigners as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, that a scholar of the Court should try to outdo the hero-worship of
Frederick	PERSON	.

		But nothing in
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	reaches the level of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's paragraph describing
Freder	PERSON	- ick 's unification of the Germans .

		One may indeed acquit the Germans of having origi - nated the Prussian epic : the stuff of
Prus	PERSON	- sian history was first made eloquent for all time by these masters of English prose .

		And it is significant that no complete collection of
Frederick	PERSON	's writings was made until some years after the appearance of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant essay .

		Lesser-knovn Mr
Theodore P. Shonts	PERSON	SOWed , builders of the and Colonel
George W. Goethals	PERSON	^ reaped ; the
Second Isthmian Commission	ORGANIZATION	labored , and the
Third Isthmian Commission	ORGANIZATION	entered into its labors .

		Such , in brief , is the burden of Mr.
W. Leon Pepper	PERSON	- man 's argument in `` Who Built the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal ? ''

		-LRB- Button -RRB- , the story of the big ditch as told by the
Chief of Office of Administration of the Second Isthmian Canal Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		Naturally enough the hero of the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	is , to most of us , he who carried the great engineering enterprise to a triumphant termination ; and almost without exception the published accounts of that undertaking ascribe the glory to the present Governor of the
Canal Zone	ORGANIZATION	, whom in this season of na - tional rejoicing over the completion of the mammoth task all are eager to honor with the recognition he unquestionably deserves .

		Hence there is room , and to spare , in the book-world for a volume calling attention to the man who , as one of the engineers expressed it in speak - ing of Mr.
Shonts	PERSON	and those under him , ' ' built the machine and started it going , and then gave the handle to
Goethals	PERSON	, who turned the crank and ground out the results . ' '

		Mr.
John F. Stevens	PERSON	, Chief Engineer under Mr.
Shonts	PERSON	, is also duly honored in Mr.
Pepperman	PERSON	's pages , and , still further to discharge a neglected duty , the abortive efforts of the French to cut the western continent in two are made to appear of vast though commonly unrecognized importance .

		In fact , the author contends that `` the three controlling factors in the final construction of the waterway across the Isthmus of
Panama	LOCATION	were the French , Theo - dore
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and the railroad men , '' the chief of the last-named being , of course , Mr.
Shonts	PERSON	.

		Noteworthy on its artistic side are the book 's reproductions of Mr.
Joseph Pen	PERSON	- nell 's deservedly famous pictures of
Panama	LOCATION	Canal scenes .

		To these are added good por - traits of the chief architects of the great work .

		Mr.
Pepperman	PERSON	's book was needed to help round out the story of the big canal .

		There is a lilt and rush of mel - Mr.
Markham	PERSON	' a .

		latest volume ody in much 01 the recent verse of Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	, now collected under the title of `` The Shoes of Happiness , and Other Poems '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , which make the worm-eaten lines of the `` new '' poets seem shabby by contrast .

		Wit - ness this from ' ' Virgilia '' : '' What was I back in the world 's first wonder ?

		An elf - child found on an ocean reef , A sea-child nursed by the surge and thunder And marked for the lyric grief . ''

		Or this from its sequel , `` The Crowning Hour '' : '' We are caught in the coil of a God 's romances We come from old worlds and we go afar : I have missed you again in the
Earth	LOCATION	's wild chances Now to another star ! ''

		The poet is represented in various moods .

		Best of the narrative verse is `` The Juggler of Touraine , '' the juggler being described as a jolly punchinello trotting out on tipsy stilts from a strange old medieval legend of the
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title poem is rich in imagery ; it is otherwise adequate in the main , but it leaves the suggestion that the search for the blue flower , the blue bird , the shoes of the shoeless beggar , or whatever the symbol , is not the theme , for Mr.
Markham	PERSON	at least , that will most nobly `` shake the soul and let the glory out . ''

		Nor do the songs of war and peace , of social vision , of religion , strike depths as unerringly as do those of love and youth .

		Of unusual distinction is `` Villon : He Still Complaineth of His Piteous Plight , ' ' for there is more than the cynic 's philosophy about the vagaries of fortune in the recurring last line of each stanza of the poem , which begins as follows : '' Here am I now in a piteous plight , Doused and dour in a hell , you see ; For I slipt and fell in the mortal fight ; I was one , but the fates were three ! ''

		A pity it is that those who would

		most Benefit by a thoughtful and fair-minded reading of Dr.
Joseph H. Crocker	PERSON	's book , `` Shall I Drink ? ''

		-LRB-
Pilgrim Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are the very ones least likely to give it even a glance .

		Its arguments , sup - ported by the best of medical and penological
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 311 and other competent authority , against the use of alcoholic liquors are so obvious as well as unanswerable that the only wonder is they should have to be stated at all .

		But it has long been a self-evident truth that men are governed , not by their reason , but by their feelings ; and hence it is that all the world does not eagerly accept and profit by such convincing demonstrations of its folly as this from Dr.
Crooker	PERSON	.

		Without fanaticism he urges the desirability , from almost every point of view , of having nothing to do with alcoholic drinks , marshalling his facts and figures and other instruments of persuasion , or dissuasion , in ten well-considered chapters , beginning with the ancient origin of what he calls `` the drink superstition , '' proceeding with a calm examination of all that can be said in favor of a more or less restricted indul - gence in intoxicants , exposing the failure of even the famous
Gothenburg	LOCATION	system and show - ing that `` liquor selling and liquor drinking can no more be made harmless than gambling and leprosy , ' ' and concluding with an encour - aging survey of present `` signs of promise . ''

		Sixteen copyrighted charts of the
Scientific Temperance Federation	ORGANIZATION	are inserted by per - mission as a graphic aid to the enforcement of the argument against drink .

		Tke most ^ su ^ ject of natural history interesting of offers a more fascinating field for study than the life-history of the American beaver .

		The beaver has probably been the subject of more pure fiction than any other known animal ; yet when one has read such a book as Mr.
A. Radclyff	PERSON	e Dug - more 's `` Romance of the Beaver '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , in which every statement is supported by indisputable evidence , generally the result of the author 's own painstaking observations , one is left with the feeling that the true life of the beaver is quite as wonderful as the fictitious exploits with which the industrious little animal is credited in some of our early narratives .

		Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	makes no more am - bitious claim for his book than that he has tried to keep the subject free from exaggera - tion and technicalities .

		He has done that , and a good deal more .

		He has brought together an extraordinary mass of material relating to the life , habits , and wonderful engineering feats of the beaver ; he has presented this ma - terial in a most attractive and convincing way , and he has illustrated every point with a photograph or an original drawing .

		Inci - dentally he makes a strong plea for the pro- tection of ' ' the most interesting animal to-day extant . ''

		The book makes a welcome addition to the scanty literature on the beaver .

		One of our most noted English scholars , Profes - sor
Thomas R. Lounsbury	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, died
April 9	DATE	at
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		Born at
Ovid	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
January 1 , 1838	DATE	r he was graduated in
1859	DATE	from the college to which he gave the best of his energies and talents for nearly the rest of his life .

		Literary work of a hum - ble sort occupied the two years following his gradu - ation ; then came three years of military service in the Civil War ; five years after its close he became instructor in English at the
Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, and from
1871	DATE	we find him holding a professorship of the English Lan - guage and Literature .

		He was librarian of the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	from
1873	DATE	to
1906	DATE	, and had been Professor Emeritus after the latter date .

		His membership in the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , and in other learned societies , bore witness to his scholarship and repute .

		Apart from his well-known Chaucerian and Shakespearean and linguistic writings , which hardly need to be enumer - ated here , he made not many contributions to litera - ture , but will be remembered for his biography of
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	in the `` American Men of Letters '' series ; and not very long before he died he published some lectures on '' The Early Literary Career of
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		He had also edited the complete works of
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, with biographical introduction .

		Vigor and independence distinguished his work as a writer even to the point of espousing the spelling-reform heresy .

WALDO R. BROWNE	PERSON	`` Better than Queed ANGELA 'S BUSINESS By
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	New York Times '' Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has written with serious intent a novel far-reaching in its issues and full of thought ; but , to the joy of his readers , he can no more help seeing the humorous side of things and writing with a twinkle in his eye than he can help breathing .

		One with
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	as to the pursuing female , he portrays to the life her engaging wiles , and gives mirth-pro - voking pictures of her methods of capture , of which that triumphal car , the ` Fordette , ' is chief ... The strongest and most satisfying of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's remarkable trio of novels . ''


New York	LOCATION	Tribune `` It is a delightful book , as thor - oughly enjoyable as its two predecessors -LRB- ' Queed ' and ` V. V. 's Eyes ' -RRB- , as full of human kindliness as they , but of far deeper understanding of the prelude to life ... The best of the three Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has written thus far . ''

		New York Globe '' The first feminist novel of any importance written in
America	LOCATION	.

		.

		Aside from being an interesting and sane contribution to the woman ques - tion , it is a delightful love story , the kind we all like . ''


Boston Herald	ORGANIZATION	`` The most genial and philosophic of the notable trio Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has produced . ''

		The Outlook `` No question ever presented for solution has needed the sanity and saving grace of humor more than the suffrage , and few discussions have so generally missed it .

		` Angela 's Busi - ness ' barely touches suffrage , but what is crudely called the ' woman question ' is fundamentally involved in the story .

		` Angela 's Business ' is a wholesome story for those men who understand neither women nor the immense extension of women 's activi - ties in the modern world .

		It is a whole - some story also for those who belong to the ` lunatic fringe of reform , ' the extreme feminists and the radical disciples of the Newness ... It is sane , normal , wholesome , light in manner but serious in temper , lacking neither wisdom , wit nor humor .

		It shows a great advance in simplicity and soundness of style over ` V. V. 's Eyes . ' ''

BRUNEL	ORGANIZATION	'S TOWER pro- gresses .

		It touches lightly upon love , upon the pathos of old age , upon the workman 's passion for his work , upon the artist 's worship of his art , upon an infinite variety of human ways and moods , and it is filled to its depths with reflections upon life that arc very near to life itself .

		NOTES 350 TOPICS IN MAY PERIODICALS ... 351 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... ... 352 A COMMODITY OF GOOD NAMES .

		Language is all names .

		Nouns , of course , are the names of persons or things ; adjectives and adverbs are the names of qualities ; verbs the names of actions .

		If you say ''
John	PERSON	ran a mile briskly '' you are simply naming first the person , second the kind of action he indulged in , third the division of space he covered , and fourth the way in which he did it .

		Pronouns are simply signs substituted for names to obvi - ate their repetition .

		Thus we say : `` John went to his house '' instead of ''
John	PERSON	went to
John	PERSON	's house . ''

		The articles , conjunctions , and prepositions are more abstract , but they are merely a thin cement to hold together the name-bricks of language .

		To name is the poet 's trade ; but collective humanity has been at work at it from the be - ginning , naming and re-naming , forming airy symbols for the realities of the world .

		All the languages and dialects are its attempts at piecing together images so they can be passed from mind to mind .

		And the vast web so fabricated is ready to the hand of the still more definitely purposed poet or prose writer to cut up into garments for the creations of his imagination .

		Language is the exercise of the world before it becomes the skill of one or a score or a hundred ; just as myriads of minute insects contribute to the building of a coral reef before palms and cocoanut trees can wave their fronds above the sea .

		As far as permanency is concerned , the anonymous haphazard naming of the multi - tude may outlast most of the labored work of the poet .

		It does not write on paper or parch - ment , but on the face of the earth on places , houses , waters , woods .

		A good percentage of territorial names must have been originally the work of fancy ; they were appellations which had a meaning of honor , irony , con - tempt .

		In a desert island story , when the ship - wrecked people have mapped out their domain , they proceed to give names to the various places , such as
Cape Fear	LOCATION	, Bay of Good Hope ,
Snug Harbor	LOCATION	, and so forth .

		This has probably been the method of the world in general .

		The nomenclature reflects the mood of the discov - erers , as in
Bret Harte	PERSON	's country with its Dead 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	Man 's
Gulch	LOCATION	and Roaring Camp and the like .

		In earlier days the territorial appellations be - came the names of the persons who dwelt in such places ; so people were called
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, Field , Wood , and innumerable other name words .

		In fact , though that collective poet , the world , is continually at work at language or naming , its efforts in personal nomenclature display a cer - tain poverty of invention .

		There are said to be only three names to-day in
Wales	LOCATION	, which we suppose are Jones ,
Lloyd	LOCATION	, and
Llewellyn	PERSON	.


China	LOCATION	has proportionally even fewer sur - names ; and most modern races betray the same narrowing of this kind of nomenclature , as though humanity had grown weary of mark - ing out its innumerable children .

		One of the ways in which humanity has par - ticularly exercised its naming faculty is in the designations given to homes , and more espe - cially inns .

		The inn names throughout En - gland are a delight to the student of the grotesque , the bizarre , the unexpected .

		A list ought to be compiled of them as a work of national humor .

		Excluding the various `` Arms '' and `` King 's Heads '' and `` Saracen Heads , '' there are a multitude of inn signs ranging from the quaint to the inexplicably queer .

		Pretty nearly all the animals , existent or imaginary , have lent their names and painted semblances to these signs .

		There is or was '' The Mermaid , '' '' The
Griffin	PERSON	, '' '' The Elephant , '' '' The White
Hart	PERSON	, '' '' The Boar 's Head , '' `` The Three Cranes in the Vintry . ''

		There are a great many trios , '' The Three Angels , '' `` The Three Tuns , '' `` The Three Nuns , '' `` The Three Cups , '' and so forth . ''

		The Goose and the Gridiron '' is understand - able ; and `` The Bull and the Gate '' is sup - posed to be a corruption of Boulogne Gate .

		But what does '' The Salutation and the Cat '' mean , or the `` The Cock and the Bottle '' ?

		Our American inns have rarely such pictur - esque names as the English , though we know of one in
Jersey	LOCATION	called '' The Blazing Rag . ''

		Speaking of the supposed monotony of no - menclature in
Wales	LOCATION	to-day , we are reminded of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's remarks about the lofty and penetrating beauty of the ancient Welsh and Cornish names ,
Tintagel	ORGANIZATION	,
Caernarvon	LOCATION	, and others .

		We used to think that there was something of this `` large utterance '' in the American Indian names ;
Pocahontas	LOCATION	, Pow - hatan ,
Manhattan	LOCATION	,
Mohawk	LOCATION	,
Pawnee	LOCATION	, have a high order of style about them .

		But too many Indian names are composed of grunts and gut - turals .

		There is a place in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	called
Wapwallopen	LOCATION	; translated , this means War - rior 's Rest , which is pretty enough .

		Then there are
Mauch Chunk	ORGANIZATION	,
Manuka Chunk	ORGANIZATION	,
Tamenend	LOCATION	, Wissahickon none of which would seem to be conceived in the style of great poetry .

		It is a sign of genius when a writer is as much concerned in the selection of his names as in the ordering of other words .

		Just what makes the names appropriate or beautiful would be difficult to say .

		Euphony counts for much , association for much .

		But after all , it is more or less of a mystery why
Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	should be a beautiful name and
Hodgins	PERSON	an ugly one ; why
Beatrice	PERSON	should be noble and graceful , and Sophronisba a trifle ridiculous .

		The taste of the best judges decides , and the world comes around to their opinion .

		There are three great divisions of names in fiction , and the appropriate and beautiful form the first .

		These , perhaps , give a writer the least trouble .

		He has simply to select from the large stock which use has approved .

		How much of the effect of
Horace 's Odes	ORGANIZATION	is due to the lovely Greek and Latin female names which they enshrine !

		We must brighten up our page with some of them ,
Lydia	PERSON	,
Lalage	LOCATION	,
Myrtale	LOCATION	,
Phryne	LOCATION	,
Glycera	LOCATION	,
Terentia	LOCATION	,
Cynara	LOCATION	,
Chloe	PERSON	,
Pyrrha	LOCATION	,
Leuconoe	LOCATION	,
Tyndaris	LOCATION	,
Barine	LOCATION	,
Asteria	LOCATION	.

		Such names have the perfection of the classic world .

		They sound like fountains rippling over marble ; they gleam like moon - light in old gardens .

		The names of Shake - speare 's girls are far more richly colored , are wilder , more full of romance .

		Rosalind ,
Juliet	PERSON	,
Viola	LOCATION	,
Miranda	LOCATION	,
Perdita	LOCATION	,
Portia	LOCATION	,
Beatrice	PERSON	,
Imogen	PERSON	, these are double roses compared with the Latin poet 's simpler flowers .

		Shake - speare was equally fortunate in his men 's names .

		In his historic plays he came into the inheritance of the Norman-English nomencla - ture , than which there has never been anything more impressive .

		In his other plays an almost infallible taste guided him in his selection of names .

		Sometimes , indeed , we think he picked out stories for the sake of the names .

		His first child , born before he left
Stratford	LOCATION	, was named Hamnet .

		Was he already brooding over the Danish Prince , or did he choose that subject because of his son ?

		Scott , also , came into a commodity of good names : Waverley -LRB- who almost gave his name to an epoch -RRB- ,
Redgaunt	PERSON	- let ,
Montrose	LOCATION	,
Douglas	PERSON	,
Marmion	PERSON	.

		Surely names were more splendid in those old days !

		than now , they were like banners flung upon
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 327 the air .

		The old lady who thrilled at the sound of the blessed name
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	was certainly not alone in her love for lofty appel - lations .

		And when names are concatenated in poetry , as they are in passages of
Milton	LOCATION	, Mar - lowe ,
Scott	PERSON	, they can move most readers still by their inspiring harmony .

		To the English lyric poets , names are almost the captain jew - els in their carcanets of words .

		Lovelace ,
Burns	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, all lift up single names until they glow like stars .

		Lander 's immortality is perhaps best assured by the eight lines which exhale the fragrance of that perfect name ,
Rose Aylmer	PERSON	.

		The second division of fiction names is that of the perfectly characteristic ; and here the writer has to labor terribly .

		We are told how Balzac used to ride around
Paris	LOCATION	studying the shop signs , in search of a name for some char - acter he had in mind .

		Dickens turned and twisted his names , until by some subtle instinct he recognized that he had the right one .

		When this did arrive it was a stroke of genius ; it was half the battle .

		It was like adding the necessary chemical to a solution , the char - acter was the precipitate .

		Would it be possi - ble to imagine
Sairey Gamp	PERSON	,
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	, the Wellers ,
Micawber	LOCATION	, or
Pecksniff	PERSON	under other names ?

		It is hardly necessary to read the novels to have some idea of these person - ages .

		At their very best , such names become proverbial .

		Don
Quixote	PERSON	's name has been made into a noun and an adjective .

		Shandy - ism is the label of a certain quality of humor .

		The Pickwickian sense excuses everything .

		Here , again , the reason for the fitness of the cognomen is a mystery .

		Why should
Quilp	PERSON	be the pre-ordained name for
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's funniest fiend ?

		Why should `` My Uncle Toby '' ex - press so much of simplicity and good nature ?

		The third species of names in fiction are those exploited in the `` comedy of humor . ''

		Compared with the perfectly characteristic ones , they are like a ready-made suit of clothes beside one made to order .

		They are created by simply labelling your personage with the name of a certain quality .

		He is introduced as the embodiment of an abstract idea .

		It is an easy way to give a character a start in life ; and if he or she wakes up and becomes a real human being , there is no great harm in it .

		The great successes in the characteristic nomencla - ture are comparatively few ; in the nomencla - ture of humor , they are many .

		For they not only pervade the old comedy from
Ben Jonson	PERSON	down to
Sheridan	PERSON	, but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the great essayists , and the novelists are full of them .

		In
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, side by side with such char - acteristic cognomens as
Falstaff	LOCATION	,
Caliban	LOCATION	, Mrs. Quickly , we have Pistol , Sir
Toby Belch	PERSON	,
Shal	PERSON	- low , and Slender .

		A vast number of the people in
Scott	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and the lesser novelists have artificial names of this kind .

		It may be objected that we are making a great deal out of nothings , that names are mere airy breath and have no reality or fitness or prophecy in them .

		The Neo-Platonists made the Logos , the word , the beginning of everything .

		The hero of
Poe	PERSON	's story , '' The Power of Words , '' breathes a new star into words simply by naming it .

		We think there is hardly any reform which would work more good in the world than one by which the whole race would gradually come to possess appropri - ately beautiful or majestic names .

		However , there is always a danger that the christening may come to naught .

		Miss
Mitford	ORGANIZATION	tells a story of a couple named Rose .

		They had a daughter whom they thought it would be poeti - cal to name Wild .

		This did very well until she grew up and married a man named Bull .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		ONE WHO LIVED THE LIFE OP A POET , faithful in thought and word and deed to a poet 's ideals , has lately passed from among us with little public demonstration of grief at his go - ing .

		Those who have read Mrs.
John Albee	PERSON	's `` Mountain Playmates '' will retain pleasant memories of the poet and nature-lover whose name , with that of his wife , has made
Pequa	PERSON	- ket , in the
New Hampshire	LOCATION	hills , a place of peculiar interest and charm on the map of
New England	LOCATION	; for here has been the Albees '
summer	DATE	home , as also at times their winter home , and here both books and Abnakee rugs have been called into being in a memorable manner , concerning which there will be found some notable chapters in '' The Gleam , '' from Mrs.
Albee	PERSON	's pen .

		Mr.
Albee	PERSON	's books include `` Literary Art , '' `` Poems , '' `` Newcastle , His - toric and Picturesque , '' '' Prose Idylls , '' '' Re - membrances of
Emerson	LOCATION	, '' `` Lake Chocorua , '' '' `` Confessions of Boyhood , '' and a life of
Henry Dexter	PERSON	, the sculptor .

		He was born at
Bellingham	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
April 3 , 1833	DATE	, was edu - cated at
Phillips Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Andover	LOCATION	, and the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	, and preached for a short time long enough to discover that he had greater aptitude for poetry than for pul - 328 THE DIAL i.
April 29	DATE	pit-pounding after which he lived for many years at
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	, an island settlement off the coast of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	near
Portsmouth	LOCATION	; and it is this little place that he has celebrated in one of the most attractive of town histories , a work which his friend Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, of Con - cord , speaks of as `` more resembling Hesiod 's recollections of Ascra than Felt 's ` Annals of Salem . ' ''

		His debt to
Emerson	LOCATION	, a kindred soul who like himself had found the pulpit untenable , may be partly learned from the fifth book in the foregoing list .

		The poet 's later years were years of painful illness , cheer - fully borne , of enforced seclusion , submitted to with contentment , though the recluse en - joyed society and was fitted to be its orna - ment , of failure to reap any adequate fruits from his literary industry , but of no depar - ture , through it all , from the modest dignity of bearing becoming one who was , in the best sense of that term , the captain of his soul .

		THE FOUNT OF FICTIVE TEARS , in which the sane and sensible
Katie Willows	PERSON	was not wont to dabble , has nevertheless a certain unde - niable charm for many other equally normal and healthy representatives of young girl - hood .

		Juvenile readers take their fiction in tremendous earnest , and rather resent than enjoy any appeal to their still undeveloped sense of humor .

		Those who have had expe - rience in reading or telling stories to children will appreciate an article in the current '' Library Journal '' on '' The Foreign Child and the Book , '' by Miss
Aniela Poray	PERSON	, who evidently knows whereof she writes .

		`` Both boys and girls , '' she has observed , '' care very little for humor in their reading , for it hardly comes in their scheme of life .

		A common request from girls is for weepy stories .

		They like '
Sara Crewe	PERSON	' for many reasons , but the fact that it is sad and pathetic is the greatest attraction .

		When books of appealing human sympathies can be found which combine also literary merit , all is well ; but when this crav - ing for weepiness seeks satisfaction in such lollipop books as those of
Nina Rhoades	PERSON	, the librarian has a hard task before her .

		It is not easy to persuade and convince the little girl that not having
Nina Rhoades	PERSON	there may be something else that she would like as well .

		With apologies to
Dickens	LOCATION	, I found him an excellent alternate for
Nina Rhoades	PERSON	and oth - ers of her kind .

		The stories of little
Paul Dombey	PERSON	,
David Copperfield	PERSON	,
Oliver Twist	PERSON	, and
Little Nell	ORGANIZATION	are pathetic , and the strange En - glish setting is forgotten in the meeting of a familiar type . ''

		With both boys and girls of foreign extraction this authority has found Lincoln to be a prime favorite in biography . ''

		They have reverence akin to awe for Wash - ington , they admire the military prowess of Dewey or Grant , but Lincoln they love . ''

		There is certainly no morbid craving for the lachrymose in the small boy 's eagerness for a new book about
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, which when he has found and read with approval he recommends to the other boys with a '' Gee , it 's great ! ''


GERMANY	LOCATION	'S APPRECIATION OF SHAKESPEARE seems not to have suffered very much from her present rupture with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's country .

		When the `` Tageblatt '' of
Berlin	LOCATION	not long ago solicited the opinion of German scholars and men of letters as to what books were best adapted to current tastes and needs , the au - thor to receive the most votes was found to be Shakespeare .

		His `` Henry V. '' led the list , and it is worth noting that it was immediately followed by three other English works , Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's `` Life of Edward VII. , ''
Seeley	PERSON	's account of `` The Expansion of
England	LOCATION	, '' and
McCarthy	PERSON	's ' ' History of Our Own Times . ' '

		German interest , naturally a somewhat ma - levolent interest just now , in the three last - named works is not hard to understand ; but in German admiration for the spirited historical drama mentioned above one sees something very different .

		In the
Bishop of Ely	ORGANIZATION	's ex - hortation to the young monarch beginning , '' Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats : You are their heir ; you sit upon their throne / ' it is not difficult to shift the scene and imagine the apostrophe addressed to the heir of the
Great Elector	LOCATION	, of
Frederick II.	PERSON	, and of Will - iam I. , especially as the purpose of the appeal is to arouse the king to war against
France	LOCATION	.

		As was declared by Professor
Brandl	PERSON	of
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	, this play is an inspir - iting thing to read when there comes the call to arms .

		He is further reported as saying : `` All that
Shakespeare	PERSON	says of his
Henry	ORGANIZATION	is applicable to our
Kaiser	PERSON	, and the aggressive humor with which he treats the French does particular good in these days . ' '

		German schol - arship has spent itself so unsparingly on Shakespeare study that no one can fairly be - grudge the Germans such comfort as they can in present trials derive from his pages .

		It even appeals to the sense of humor to find them turning to their own use against En - gland the greatest of
England	LOCATION	's poets .

		THE READING OF SCHOOL CHILDREN tends to become , in these opening days of the ever - inviting outdoor season , a negligible quantity ; and this is in great part as it should be .

		Still the problem of how to bring together at the psychological moment the child and the book
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 329 he most needs loses none of its importance with the shifting of the seasons .

		At the
Library School	ORGANIZATION	in
Albany	LOCATION	, as explained in the current record of things accomplished there during the past year , added attention is given to this question in a newly established `` li - brary institute open only to district superin - tendents of schools . ''

		This is one branch merely of the regular
summer	DATE	activity of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	, and the ses - sions were attended by thirty-one superin - tendents , who took an energetic part in the discussions and showed a genuine interest in the topics discussed .

		What aid the
State	ORGANIZATION	gives toward the furnishing of small school libraries was learned in detail by those attend - ing ; and , further , as we are informed , `` an important feature was an exhibit , classified by grades , of several hundred books suitable for the first eight school grades .

		The prac - tical character of this exhibit was shown by the fact that a number of those in attendance used it as a partial basis for books to be recom - mended for purchase during the coming year . ''

		Among the lectures delivered are to be noted several on such generally interesting themes as `` What is Education and Who are Educated ? '' ''

		The School Library in Agricultural Educa - tion , '' and '' Selection of Historical Material for Schools , '' while to those who delight in technicalities were offered instructive talks on '' Some Essentials of Cataloguing , '' ''
Clas	PERSON	- sification of School Libraries , '' and kindred subjects .

		... THE IMPROBABILITIES AND IMPOSSIBILITIES OF FICTION surely need not be so numerous and so glaring as they are .

		Creative authorship is not incompatible with some degree of critical sagacity even in regard to one 's own inspira - tions .

		Why should
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	, to cite an old and familiar instance , allow himself such absurdi - ties as are encountered in his description of the pecuniary embarrassments of the hero of `` Ralph the Heir '' ?


Ralph Newton	PERSON	, a young man of twenty-seven , has but recently run through the greater part of a considerable for - tune , and is reduced to the necessity of asking credit from the tradesmen with whom he deals .

		To his boot-maker he is represented to be in debt to the extent of two hundred and seven - teen pounds a thousand dollars , approxi - mately , for boots within perhaps two years !

		And for leather riding breeches his debt to Neefit of Conduit Street is equally absurd .

		There is no excuse for this straining of the reader 's credulity .

		Sheer carelessness , or wantonness , on the author 's part , it must be called .

		Of course it is a small matter ; but why wreck the verisimilitude of a good story in this needless fashion ?

		Again , ` to take an example from current fiction , in `` The Awak - ening , '' by
Henry Bordeaux	PERSON	-LRB- if that be the author 's real name -RRB- , we read in the third chapter about a certain `` telegraphed letter '' which in very explicit terms is distinguished from ordinary mail correspondence ; yet only two pages later a person to whom the mes - sage is handed for perusal is made to recog - nize the sender 's handwriting , `` although it was stiffer , firmer , with sudden flourishes and unfinished letters . ''

		Apparently this com - munication , so painstakingly impressed upon us as a telegram , changes its character in a twinkling and becomes an autograph docu - ment .

		We have here to do with an old com - plaint of novel-readers against novel-writers , as old as novels themselves , no doubt ; but the fact remains that it is just such disconcerting tricks , or lapses , as this that make the judi - cious novel-reader grieve .

		... ONE YEAR 'S WORK OF OUR LARGEST PUBLIC LIBRARY , epitomized in statistical form , makes a showing that is , to say the least , impressive .

		In the twelve months ending last
December	DATE	the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	lent 9,516,482 books for home use , opened four new branch libraries , added 201,805 volumes , supplied 83,319 books by inter-branch loans , served 1,267,879 readers in adults ' reading-rooms , lent 26,224 embossed books to blind readers , lent 973,856 books by travelling libraries , lent 4,114,515 books to children , served 1,502,185 readers in the children 's reading-rooms , con - ducted 48 reading clubs for children , supplied rooms for hundreds of public meetings , gave away 300,000 copies of the `` Branch Library News , '' lent 649,727 books in 26 foreign lan - guages ; the
Reference Department	ORGANIZATION	of the main library served 711,122 readers , supplied for reference use 2,127,328 books , added to its collection 41,727 books and 2,320 pamphlets , opened a
Manuscript Division	ORGANIZATION	, held exhibitions of etchings , prints , books , and manuscripts , and answered thousands of questions by word of mouth , by letter , or by telephone , through the
Information Division	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Municipal Reference Library in the Municipal Building was also taken in charge .

		With pardonable pride
New York	LOCATION	now turns to the other great cities of the world with the classic interroga - tion , '' Can you beat it ? ''

		A PRINTER WITH THE SPIRIT OF AN ARTIST may raise typography almost to a fine art , if not quite .

		As long as the world reads books it will be interested in the
Elzevirs	LOCATION	and
Aldine	PERSON	- ; and De Vinnes of the printing craft .

		The famous English printer ,
John Baskerville	PERSON	, has recently been made the subject of a rather 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	notable study from the pen of
Josiah Henry Benton	PERSON	, LL.D. , but the fact that the book is privately printed will debar it from the wider circulation it might otherwise have been expected to attain .

		This
Birmingham	LOCATION	writing - master and improver of the process of japan - ning turned his manual dexterity to good account , toward the middle of his fifth decade , in designing and cutting type , and it was only after becoming a type-founder that he devoted himself to the allied industry of printing .

		The story of his famous editions of Virgil and Hor - ace and
Milton	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	, and many others , is too long to tell here even in outline ; but from the concluding paragraph of Dr.
Benton	PERSON	's book a brief passage can be given . ''

		What is it , '' he asks , '' that makes the life and work of this middle-aged , vain , and silly
Birmingham	LOCATION	Englishman interesting to us ?

		Why do we collect his imprints , and why do we talk about him ?

		I think it is because he had the true artistic vision and courage .

		He conceived the idea of a perfect book , such as had not been printed in
England	LOCATION	... He conceived the book as an artist conceives a statue before he strikes a blow with his chisel into the marble . ''

		Baskerville made or supervised the making of everything that went into his books ; he printed of course on a hand press , and there was noth - ing of the roar and rush of a modern printing establishment in his little office , which was but a room in his dwelling-house .

		Thoroughly an artist in his chosen calling , he touched nothing that he did not adorn in the field of printing and book-manufacture .

		GREEDY READERS give less offence than do gluttonous eaters .

		Still it is an unpleasing spectacle to behold a person in a public read - ing-room sitting on a half-dozen of his favorite magazines and holding as many more under the periodical he happens to be reading at the time .

		The unpleasantness is intensified when perchance one has urgent need or compelling desire to consult one of the pre-empted pub - lications .

		At one of the branches of the
Enoch Pratt	PERSON	Free Library of
Baltimore	LOCATION	the younger readers have developed a most astonishing in - genuity in hiding their favorite books for future use .

		From the current Report pre - pared by Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	a rather notably inter - esting contribution to this special department of literature we quote an incident as related by the assistant to whose knowledge it came .

		`` One little girl , '' she writes , `` came to me at the close of the first day -LSB- after the opening of the branch -RSB- and very proudly told me she had put away enough good books to last her a week .

		I tried to explain to her why this should not be done , but she evidently did not view things in the same light , because , when I was arrang - ing the books the next morning , I found seven copies of our most attractive fairy tales packed very neatly behind a row of the Expositor 's Bible . ' '

		By what precocity of shrewdness did that child know that of all books the Bible was the least likely to be disturbed ?

		A
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	IRVING ANECDOTE , by no means new , but perhaps all the better for its seasoned quality , was appreciatively received the other day by the students of the
Hackley School	ORGANIZATION	at
Tarrytown	LOCATION	, to whom Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, son of Irving 's publisher and close friend , was relating some reminiscences of the famous author .

		In his infancy
Irving	PERSON	had enjoyed the honor , or at least submitted to it , of receiving the blessing of the great man after whom he was named .

		`` But you can not see the place where his sacred hands touched my head , '' the one thus honored used to add in his later years when he recounted the incident ; and the reason of this invisi - bility was such a puzzle to the boy Putnam that he questioned his father on the subject .

		The answer , if not already known , will sug - gest itself easily enough to anyone familiar with
Irving	PERSON	's portrait and the artist 's rather obvious indication of the distinguished au - thor 's indebtedness to his perruquier .

		This story , recalling the quasi-godfatherly relation of our first president to our first writer of more than domestic repute , prompts the renewed query why Irving should have habitually sup - pressed the first element of his baptismal name and not taken pride in calling himself
George Washington Irving	PERSON	.

		A letter of his , written in
Spain	LOCATION	, is said to have recently come to light with this full signature appended , in proof that he had a good right thereto .

		WHETTING THE READER 'S APPETITE with tempting titbits from an author 's works may seem inexpedient to most makers of library catalogues , who naturally account it a suffi - cient task to record fully and accurately a book 's author , title , place of publication , and date , with any important peculiarities in its mechanical make-up .

		Not so , however , does the matter present itself to the compiler of the monthly book-lists in the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's `` Branch Library News , '' a late number of which devotes a section to `` Poets of To-day '' and not only names their chief works but spares sufficient space to quote , in most instances , an illustrative bit of verse from those works .

		Moreover , the fair page of this inviting catalogue is undeformed by any Dewey or Cutter or other cabalistic symbol denoting the book 's place in the ranks of its
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 331 fellows , so that one may the more sensibly feel that one is reading , not a `` finding-list , '' not a mere inventory of goods , but an anthology .

		Sixty-one contemporary poets are honored with a place in this florilegium .

		The follow - ing lines are from Mr.
W. H. Davies	PERSON	's '' Songs of Joy '' : '' Sing out my soul , thy songs of joy ; Such as a happy bird will sing Beneath a
Rainbow	ORGANIZATION	's lovely arch In early
spring	DATE	. ''

		FROM GOWN TO KHAKI has of late been so generally the rule at the English universities that probably not a third of the customary number of students are now in attendance at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and those that still pursue the pleasant paths of letters and learn - ing at these seats of culture are said to be chiefly our own Rhodes scholars or other American students , East Indian seekers after knowledge , and invalids very manifestly in - capacitated for military service .

		An able - bodied young Englishman would naturally shrink from showing himself in academic at - tire at this time ; the training camp or the battle-field is , unfortunately , likely to be the scene of his activities for some months to come .

		Amid the general economic waste of the war must be reckoned the enforced idleness , partial or entire , not only of workshops and factories , but also of educational `` plants '' rep - resenting incalculable investments of money and talent and noble endeavor .

		`` With English , German , French , Belgian , Russian , Serbian , and Austrian higher institutions of learning thus reduced to more or less complete inactiv - ity , who can any longer have a good word to say for the '' educational '' influence of war ?

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		A CORRECTION AND SOME OTHER MATTERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Perhaps I owe THE DIAL and its readers an apol - ogy for a certain annoying slip of the pen which occurred in my communication published in your issue of
March 18	DATE	.

		In that number -LRB- page 198 , line 5 -RRB- the word '' imperative '' should have given way to '' imperfect . ''

		The error certainly escaped my notice until it appeared in cold print ; but the reader who is sufficiently interested may make the correction in his own copy , as I have done , and may perhaps be charitable enough to ascribe it to such a pre-occupation with the poetic subject that sub - consciously I could not resist the temptation to rhyme upon '' narrative '' the erratic '' imperative . ''

		Let me take this occasion for expressing my agreement with Mr.
Ralph Bronson	PERSON	, in the state - ment contained in his communication on '' War and Poetry '' in the above-mentioned issue , that `` the violently partisan spirit pervading most of the verse of the present war is chiefly responsible for its failure to measure up to high poetic standards . ''

		The war verse appearing in '' The Poetry Review '' of
London	LOCATION	, for instance , I think is largely of this nature .

		Why elaborate in metre and rhyme , some - times even in the most ambitious forms , what the large generality of history may most likely over - shadow , or prove untrue , within perhaps the next generation ?

		Poetry is the twin-Muse of history , if not her elder sister , and scarcely lends herself readily to argumentation and debate .

		Mr.
W. N. Ewer	PERSON	's poem , '' Five Souls , '' although on the whole a step in the right direction , to my mind gives forth a certain cynical breath , which in true lyric poetry is rather disturbing than agreeable , especially if such lines strike us as being inclined to preach '' the essential folly of war . ''

		War is , or has so far been , a permanent and indisputable fact of life , and we have no assurance that it will not be as recurrent in the future as it has been in the past .

		War can not so easily be spirited away out of human history , and for that reason has almost as much right to be considered and recognized as a fixity as has peace .

		Anyone convinced of this can not in the reading of anti-bellum verse , feel the pure and unalloyed pleas - ure which true poetry ought always to give .

		Finally , I feel constrained to take friendly excep - tion to the attitude expressed in this sentence from your leading article , in the same issue : '' The sooner we recognize that life and literature are separate businesses the sooner we shall begin to produce something worth while in the latter field . ''

		While I believe that the main principle here set forth is indisputably sound , namely , that litera - ture , especially '' absolute poetry , '' '' must be more or less removed from life , '' it might be well not to emphasize this axiom too strongly in that form just at the present tune , when the unstable transition period through which modern poetry is passing would seem to demand that we show the close con - nection between the '' special language , movement , ordering of words and atmosphere '' of poetry .

		Certain influential modern poets have already been so thoroughly overwhelmed by the idea of the essen - tial separateness between poetry and life , that they are dangerously near to '' prosifying '' the classic Muse of metre and rhyme .

		It would therefore seem to be more feasible to demonstrate , if possible , the close connection between poetry and the facts of life : between the movements of life and those of rhythm and metre ; between the changing aspects of life , and the heart and the soul , and the varied order of words , of cadences , rhymes , and even speech-sounds , in true poetry , as long as the latter bears the unmistakable ear-marks of really being such .

		Restrained freedom is the law of beautiful living , of nature in her most pleasurable aspects , and consequently also of true poetry .

		True poetry is in itself a restraint on the '' huge , confused , and haphazard '' mass of life 's facts , and the supreme task of the critic of poetry is the establishment of some standard by which the fine balance between the comparatively lawless freedom of life and its often cruel restraints might be judged with some accuracy , as well as sufficient flexibility ; and not only this , but the constant advocacy of the princi - ple , that this free-restrained , beautiful balance of life-facts be made more and more permanent , and 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	kept inviolable , in the preservative pages of true poetry .

		If our critic of the future could be great enough even to approximate such a working crite - rion of judgment , he might conclusively and con - vincingly demonstrate the intimacy between life and true poetry ; then he might really weigh in this delicate balance all verse that came within his ken , and cast aside what is found wanting ; and then he might be an agent in preserving the purity of true poetry unto the generations to come .

		LITERARY RECIPROCITY WITH THE
LATIN AMERICAS	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It seems singular that we who are embarked on these two Western continents should be separated by idea-proof bulkheads .

		The lanes of intellectual communication all run east and west .

		Now that the great war , like an iron curtain dropping to cut off the conflagration on the stage from the audience in the theatre , has measurably interrupted our com - munications with
Europe	LOCATION	, perhaps we neighbors will begin to pay some attention to each other .

		I am moved to these remarks by a communication from
Senor Arturo R. de Carricarte	PERSON	, who has been the most persevering friend American literature has had in the countries south of us .

		In a review first established at
Vera Cruz	PERSON	and continued in
Cuba	LOCATION	in the pages of the
Havana	LOCATION	'' Figaro , '' and more lately in the '' Heraldo de
Cuba	LOCATION	, '' he has for years reviewed and exploited American literature .

		He has tried to break down the prejudices , literary and political , of his countrymen and kin .

		He writes that it is incredible how many books and articles appear in the Latin Americas directed against the
United States	LOCATION	.

		All the reactionaries in religion or politics , and most of those who claim descent from
Spain	LOCATION	or
Portugal	LOCATION	, are more or less inimical to us .

		He thinks the present is a good time to break down this hostility and inaugurate an intellectual confed - eration between the Anglo-Saxon and Latin races of
America	LOCATION	.

		I think he is right .

		Perhaps now that
Europe	LOCATION	is closed to our globe-trotters and sight - seers , the tide of travel may turn southward , and people of culture may satisfy themselves as to the interest of the Latin American countries and the culture , courtesy , and charm of life to be found there .

		In this connection I have a suggestion to make in regard to the name of our own country .

		We are all Americans , North or South , as all the inhabi - tants of
Europe	LOCATION	are Europeans .

		Over there , how - ever , they make no account of this vague geograph - ical title , but pin all their pride and patriotism on their national names .

		It seems to us a case of poverty , not a cause for pride , that we have no national name .

		Our official appellation , '' United States of
North America	LOCATION	, '' is formidable enough , but poetry is appalled at it and it must take up a good deal of room on a passport .

		Nobody could possibly use it affectionately or intimately .

		Why should we not take the initial letters of this title and turn it into a name
Usona	LOCATION	.

		This would be brief and musical , as are most of the great geo - graphical and national names
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, etc. .

		And it would not be an inno - vation , but merely an abbreviation of the old title .

		We could call ourselves Usonians , which would be a mellifluous and mouth-filling appellation .

		The idea is a new one , at least , I have never heard of it before ; and it really seems worthy of considera - tion , c.

		A QUOTATION FROM SOPHOCLES IN MEREDITH 'S LETTERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a letter from Box Hill , Dorking ,
1901	DATE	, to Lady
Ulrica Duncombe	PERSON	,
George Meredith	PERSON	quotes lines 94-5 of Sophocles 's '' Trachiniae '' -LRB- Roman letters -RRB- .

		They read as follows -LRB- `` Letters of George Mere - dith , '' Vol .

		II. , p. 519 -RRB- : '' Ou arola n & x enargomSna Tiktei kateunasoi te phlogesomenai . ''

		They should read thus -LRB-
Jebb	PERSON	's text -RRB- : '' ` on aiola mix enarizomdna tiktei kateunazei te phlogiz6menon . ''

		Thus it will be seen that , in
Meredith	LOCATION	's version , seven out of eight words contain errors .

		These errors are due , however , not to
Meredith	PERSON	's ignorance of Greek ; for Mr.
S. S. McClure	PERSON	says in his autobiography that
Meredith	PERSON	recited long pas - sages of the '' Iliad '' to him .

		They must be attribu - ted , rather , to his obscure handwriting , of which Mr.
B. W. Matz	PERSON	has written in ''
George Meredith	PERSON	as Publisher 's Reader '' -LRB- `` Fortnightly Review , ''
N. S. 86	PERSON	, p. 283 ,
1909	DATE	-RRB- .

		The lines are translated in '' The Nation 's '' re - view of the `` Letters '' -LRB-
December 5 , 1912	DATE	-RRB- , as follows : '' Whom spangled night , as she dies away , Brings forth , and again lulls to sleep . ''

		The last word of the quotation is therefore omitted , and no comment on the incorrectness of the Greek is offered .

		Other reviewers , as far as I can dis - cover , take no notice of the passage .

Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	collected by him , and of an ac - companying essay on
Jefferson	PERSON	's architectural work , is desirous of knowing of other drawings by

		He would also be glad to know of relevant letters and memoranda existing outside of the principal public repositories of

		FISKE
KIMBALL	PERSON	.

		University of
Michigan	LOCATION	,
April 20 , 1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 333 OUR PAINTER OF THE SEA AND THE SHORE .

		* Everything that really adds to our knowl - edge of American painting and our love and appreciation of it is good , and especially when it comes in such form as the essay by Mr.
Kenyon Cox	PERSON	in a now well-known series of monographs on American painters .

		We have spoken of these monographs several times and of the excellence of their production , their printing , and their pictures .

		The earlier vol - umes have been on
George Inness	PERSON	,
Homer Martin	PERSON	, and
Ralph Blakelock	PERSON	, and there have been additional numbers with more pictures by
Inness	PERSON	and by
Martin	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pity that these very useful books should be so expen - sive , for the knowledge of American painting should be as wide-spread as possible .

		But one can hardly have a quarrel with the publishers on that score , unless one should be willing to guarantee -LRB- if in thought only -RRB- the disposal of a popular edition .

		We should like to have the public able to have and see the material to be found in these handsome books , even in less elegant form ; but it is doubtful whether the public would back that desire in any sub - stantial way .

		THE DIAL has also in previous reviews expressed regret that these volumes should not be furnished with some matters that would be useful to the student , such as a bibliography or a list of the artist 's paintings .

		But criticisms like these may be made -LRB- and have been -RRB- on the whole series , and need not be repeated now .

		The interest in the present work lies in its presentation and estimate of the work of
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the last years of his life , and since his death in
1910	DATE	,
Winslow Homer	PERSON	has con - stantly risen in general estimation .

		One of the great figures of what may be called the second period of American painting , he did not come to artistic maturity until the
end of the last century	DATE	.

		But when he did get to the power of actual self-expression , he had reached so strong and so original an artistic personality that he became almost at once a figure of the first rank .

		He was born in the same decade as
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Homer Martin	PERSON	, and
Wyant	PERSON	, and only a dozen years or so after
Inness	PERSON	,
Fuller	ORGANIZATION	, and Hunt .

		But
Homer	PERSON	did not come to that power of expression by which he is really known until he was fifty years old .

		He was recognized early ; he was elected to the
National Academy	ORGANIZATION	before any of those just named , who might be considered * WINSLOW HOMER .

		By
Kenyon Cox	ORGANIZATION	.

		York :
Frederic Fairchild Sherman	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New his contemporaries .

		But the work that is now deemed his best came later than the chief work of those others , indeed after the death of several .

		Homer was one of an earlier gen - eration lasting on into our own time , not with decreasing power and impaired vigor , but with a power and vigor that enabled him to do his best work .

		And this is certainly a noteworthy thing .

		In a generation of all sorts of new ideas in artistic aim and technique , the fame of so great a man as
George Inness	PERSON	varies ; people who once admired him above all will be found to be cold to his art .

		Homer
Martin	PERSON	was never popular in his life - time ; and if I can judge at all , he is not popular now .

		Hunt and Fuller are not well known by the average picture lover of to-day .

		But
Winslow Homer	PERSON	, who cared nothing for popu - larity , and in his later years was apt to say he cared nothing even for painting , would seem to be growing in public estimation .

		More of his pictures are seen in the great collections ; more is said and written of him .

		There are , for instance , eight pictures by Homer in the Metropolitan Museum of
New York	LOCATION	, which is more than there are of any of the other artists just named , beside a dozen remarkable water-colors .

		I would give them all for my pick of the Innesses and the
Homer Martins	PERSON	; but that personal view has nothing to do with the general interest that with little doubt now holds
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	to be one of the three greatest of our later American painters -LRB- not living -RRB- , the other two being
Whistler	LOCATION	and
Inness	PERSON	.

		Such a position naturally offers reason for such an estimate as that of Mr.
Kenyon Cox	PERSON	's , and for especial interest in it .

		How was it that this painter who did nothing so wonder - ful before
1885	DATE	, say , should at a time when his contemporaries were beginning to cease production , be able to create work which should gain for him a greater interest than that of any of the others , and should do so at a time full of new ideas in painting , both as regards the thing painted and the way of painting it ?

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's essay is an estimate of Homer 's quality as a painter .

		He does not attempt a study of Homer 's life , but accepts the results of the work of
W. H. Downes	PERSON	, which appeared shortly after the death of the painter .

		What is of chief interest in his view , to my mind , is that we have here the view of one painter by another , put simply and in language that the ordinary person can understand .

		Generally when you talk with a painter about art or artists he aids his explanation by gesture or by painter 's phrases , which give his criticism a character , but make it hard to understand 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	except by others of the craft .

		Here is a view of a wholly competent observer , expressed with ease and force .


Winslow Homer	PERSON	was a man noteworthy in his generation for the force and singleness of aim with which he went about his business .

		He saw much of American life ; in a country town as well as in
New York	LOCATION	, in war as well as in peace , in the great woods as well as on the
New England	LOCATION	sea-shore .

		But he had especially , or perhaps finally , a definite per - ception such as no other American artist had of the greatness and beauty of the sea and of the lives lived on or near it .

		Other things he painted too , but this was the thing he loved and observed and studied and knew best .

		He was something like Millet .

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	says : '' To paint a simple , every-day occurrence , a part of the routine of life , and by one 's treat - ment of it to reveal its deeper implications and make manifest the dignity and the romance of the life of which it forms a part that is what
Millet	PERSON	did for the tillers of the soil and what Homer does for the fisherman and the sailor . ''

		And with this fully American aim and in - terest Homer had such powers as enabled him to paint fine pictures .

		He was direct ; care - less of convention , of talk , of considerations ; he wanted the real thing .

		Further -LRB- and here Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's professional testimony is of great value -RRB- he was a remarkable master of observa - tion , and saw things that no one else saw , and painted things that no one else had painted .

		So when he had settled with himself what he wanted , and it took him a good while to do so , he was apt to render it very truly , or at least with a truth that people could appre - ciate .

		Besides which he would make any effort to render what he saw and indeed was inclined to feel that his '' art '' consisted merely in resolutely confining his painting to what he saw .

		But however that was , he desired his painting to grow out of his own experience , for he studied with no one .

		And here we need especially what Mr.
Cox	PERSON	can give us ; for here the artist sees easily that Homer had certain artistic gifts of which per - sonally he was inclined to make slight ac - count , chiefly the great gift or sense of design and composition , so that he naturally painted and selected in such a way as to give the .

		things he painted the sense of life and move - ment that is so remarkable in them .

		Something like this is Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's estimate of Homer , and one can see that it makes him at once an interesting man .

		We would not so much comment upon the judgment , as present it and call attention to it .

		Homer had a very interesting and even a very American subject , and he had a certain definite and exceptional power .

		So now his pictures may stand clear in our mind ; he is a definite personality , more so , I take it , than
William M. Hunt	PERSON	, who was a greater influence , or than
George Fuller	PERSON	, who to many is more delightful .

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	, in looking over his contemporaries , thinks of no personalities more striking than his , except , as we have said ,
Whistler	LOCATION	and
Inness	PERSON	.

		I should like to add
Homer Martin	PERSON	, and would be content to leave the four as representative of painting in
America	LOCATION	in the generation be - fore our own .

		I do not know who else ought to be mentioned ;
Wyant	PERSON	,
Tryon	PERSON	,
Vedder	PERSON	,
Blakelock	PERSON	, La Farge , we might think of one or another for a moment , but they hardly seem to me to belong with the four who have been named .

		Of these four , much has been written and printed on
Whistler	LOCATION	; this series of monographs has presented worthy consid - eration of the others .

		We shall watch with interest to see who will be the next selection .

		It may add to the value of these considera - tions if I add that perhaps owing to the lack of them I have never been able to care much for the pictures of
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps if I had been better instructed , if I had had in mind the finer points of design , of composition here spoken of , I might not be so impressed as I am with some other things that I feel in
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	's pictures .

		A stray remark made about the '' High Cliff '' when the
Evans Collection	ORGANIZATION	was exhibited some years ago , at the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	I think , gives opportunity for some explanation .

		The critic noted `` the actual quality of foamy water , the soft yielding of it , the invertebrate yet unconquerable weight that is its own . ''

		If a sea-painter could render just those things all would be impressed .

		But in those expres - sions -LRB- excepting that about the weight of the water -RRB- the critic seems to me to have picked out just the qualities that
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	's pictures do not have .

		His water to my eye has by no means the actual quality of foamy water , it is not soft or yielding ; and if it is invertebrate , it is more like the turtle than the jelly-fish .

		But this feeling of mine that
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	is singularly stiff and solid for a great painter seems quite opposed to the general opinion , and is certainly very different from that of Mr.
Cox	PERSON	.

		I shall not pretend to a finer feeling than most , and I shall certainly confess to smaller opportuni - ties .

		But I can not refrain from stating the way it appears to me .

		And I urge anyone who thinks I am wrong to go to the Metro - politan Museum -LRB- or any other place where there is a like opportunity ; best would be the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, where is
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 335 the picture in question -RRB- and look at the sea - pictures by Homer .

		Then if he has ever seen the masses of the sea come thundering in upon the rocks , he can form his own opinion .

		Whichever way he decides , it is not probable that
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	will care much .

		He felt deeply the beauty and force and greatness of the sea and the shore , and he rendered it with all the power of his genius , and was content to let it go at that .

		I would not say a word which would prevent another seeing that great spectacle as he saw it .

		And Mr.
Cox	PERSON	has said much that will help .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		ELIZABETHAN TRAGIC TECHNIQUE .

		* The study of dramatic technique which has become so general of late has its unfortunate side .

		It has been perverted .

		`` We are well enough pleased that courses of instruction should be given , and books written , to pry into the advantages and disadvantages of such mat - ters as having the hero 's cigar go out or the phial shown suggestively three times over in preparation for the drinking of the fatal potion .

		We realize the need of good technical workmanship and of the skilful use of theatri - cal devices .

		But play writing has its strategy as well as its tactics .

		Or , to put the distinction in other words , the trivialities so often taken for the whole of technique are only a part of it ; necessary of course , but subsidiary , auxil - iary ; not the essential stuff of which great plays are made .

		There is a mental as well as a mechanical aspect of drama : an artist 's prob - lem as well as a juggler 's problem ; a work for creative imagination as well as a work for con - triving judgment .

		Against the notion that ' ' technique ' ' is drama we positively rebel .

		As well say that a sleight of hand mastery of allit - eration , assonance , variety of pitch and pause , can produce unaided an `` Eve of St. Agnes '' ; or that an observance of the thou shalt 's and thou shalt not 's of argumentation can produce a `` Reply to
Hayne	PERSON	. ''

		At a time of so much lecturing and writing by those shrewd wits and little souls who fancy that , since the tricks of the trade are necessary to drama , drama is to be measured solely by its employment of the tricks of the trade , it is refreshing to find a painstaking study of the technique of a great period in tragedy that does not stop with external things .

		Dr.
Fansler	PERSON	's study , made under the direction of Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	, is not mindless of the - atrical details ; neither is it tied down by them , * THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIC IN ELIZABETHAN TRAGEDY .

		By
Harriet Ely Fansler	PERSON	, Ph.D. , Assistant Professor of En - glish ,
University of the Philippines	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chicago : Row ,
Peterson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		like Gulliver by the cables of
Lilliput	LOCATION	.

		It is a record and investigation of the successive problems that confronted , not the mere crafts - men , but the artists of varying greatness , who wrought in Elizabethan days .

		With fresh illustrations and orderly pro- cedure , Dr.
Fansler	PERSON	traces the evolution of the elements in the dramatic heritage which fell to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The religious drama was formless , but it had good situations ; it was rich in `` acted scenes presenting a not inconsider - able amount of realistic spectacle and making a strong emotional appeal . ''

		Curious par - allels are shown between some of these scenes and scenes in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		The religious drama may also in part , through the promi - nence it gave to the crucifixion , have caused English tragedy , in much more nearly a uni - versal way than Greek or Latin , to associate death with the catastrophe .

		The Senecan drama furnished a clear dramatic motive , usu - ally the motive of revenge .


Marlowe	PERSON	showed the importance of the protagonist .

		The first distinct mark of Shakespearean technique was the development of the antagonist , who was vested with individuality and an equal impor - tance with the protagonist in the catastrophe of `` Richard III . ''

		By far the greater portion of the book is devoted to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		His tech - nique is presented as an evolution ; the trage - dies are examined seriatim with reference to large problems of dramatic art .

		Thus ' '
Julius Cassar	PERSON	'' is treated under the caption of `` The Rise and the Crisis-Emphasis , Including the Tragic Incident . ' '

		This somewhat formidable title loses its terrors when we perceive certain things .

		Brutus , though in part sharing with Cassius , is regarded as the protagonist , and the play is held to be '' the first of our extant tragedies in which we see the protagonist defi - nitely and steadily rise to a single crisis deed , willed by him , expected by the audience , and elaborately executed in a well-organized scene or scene-group , unpreceded by violent and dis - tracting incidents . ''

		Hence the word `` Rise '' in the chapter-title .

		The term `` Crisis - Emphasis ' ' is equally justified . ' '

		Shakespeare meant to set Antony forth as a retributive antagonist of
Brutus	LOCATION	, not a contestant from the beginning as
Hereford	ORGANIZATION	with
Richard	PERSON	, but as one roused to action by a deed ... '
Julius Caesar	PERSON	' is the first of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's extant tragedies in which there is clear evidence of a consciousness of the crisis-emphasis as a func - tional point of structure . ' '

		There is the obvious risk that intentions will be detected which were never in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's mind .

		Dr.
Fansler	PERSON	obviates this in part by warning us that artistic processes are not al - 336 -LSB-
April 29	DATE	ways conscious .

		There is the possibility like - wise that the validity of an idea depends upon the point of view .

		Thus
Freytag	PERSON	is attacked for censuring Shakespeare because the scene is not given wherein
Antony	PERSON	decides to return to
Cleopatra	LOCATION	.

		But were not two possible effects open to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, one through a scene of decision , the other through the undi - vided emotion of the catastrophe ; and shall we either praise or condemn absolutely , since a choice was necessary and the emphasis had to go one way or the other ?

		Finally , there is the danger that aspects of a problem will be overlooked .

		`` The introduction of ` Macbeth ' is therefore so far better than that of ` Lear , ' ' says Dr.
Fansler	PERSON	, '' as it shows the protagonist before the crisis in a rise long enough to assure the spectator that the doer of the deed appre - ciates his own act ... We see
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	rise from thought to deed . ''

		In so far as this statement commends the introduction of `` Macbeth , '' it will hold .

		But in so far as it implies that the rash act of Lear should be made deliberate , it is entirely at fault .

		Shake - speare here had to do with stubborn material ; with an act which was indispensable if the play was to go on at all , and which yet was unbelievable .

		The more he could inveigle his audience into accepting it as a postulate , the more he could turn attention from its inherent improbability , the better the play would fare and the surer sympathy the old king would evoke .

		The introduction of `` Lear '' shows a dexterous lessening of insuperable difficulties .

		Many objections like this might be raised , but in the majority of cases no definite conclu - sion can be reached ; tastes and interpreta - tions will continue to vary .

		Dr.
Fansler	PERSON	's study is a helpful one .

		Its opinions are not al - ways new , but they are well-considered .

		Here is its summary of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's contribution : `` What , then , is a Shakespearean tragedy ?

		Is it a story ?

		Yes ; in the sense of ' a body of facts of special significance . '

		All Elizabethan dramas were stories .

		But a Shakespearean tragedy is not primarily narrative .

		Its action is not narrative , and herein is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's distinction from all predecessors .

		The action of a Shakespearean trag - edy is the presentation through stage devices of the issuing of events out of character and the issuing of catastrophe for that character out of those events ... Character-action is Shakespeare 's con - tribution to the world 's dramatic literature .

		Char - acter-action is Elizabethan tragic technic at its supreme evolution .

		In a large sense it might be said , for contrast , that Greek drama presents the struggle of man with events super-beings create ; Senecan , the struggle of man with events fellow beings create ; but Elizabethan , the struggle of man with events his own being creates . ''

		AMERICAN EXPAXSIOX ix THE FAR WEST .

		* It is not an easy matter to tell the story of the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	and the conquest of
New Mexico	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	with full enthusi - asm and endorsement , especially when one is consciously supplementing the work of the inimitable
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		Yet both these tasks Professor
McElroy	PERSON	has set himself in the four hundred pages of his `` Winning of the Far West . ''

		How far he has succeeded may be left to the reader .

		But the important events and move - ments which have a bearing on the far west - ward expansion during the period of
1829	DATE	to
1867	DATE	are interestingly dealt with .


Andrew Jackson	PERSON	and
Henry Clay	ORGANIZATION	are duly praised , though the two leaders were diametrically opposed to each other all their lives .

		That
Jackson	PERSON	was right in counselling and even in - triguing for the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	, and that Clay was also right in opposing and intriguing against the same movement , Professor McEl - roy does not attempt to prove ; though some readers might think he had actually done this .


Sam Houston	PERSON	is another `` hero '' depicted as doing pioneer service in the great cause of American expansion as if the expansion of the
United States	LOCATION	were the most natural and righteous things in the world .

		There is a bit of chauvinism that reminds one of French - German phraseology in the terms `` crowning glory '' -LRB- p. 292 -RRB- and `` glorious conquest '' -LRB- p. 297 -RRB- with which the author describes ` the move - ments of the American '' army of invasion , '' as though the very term invasion were not sug - gestive of a wide departure from the national professions .

		Still one may not cavil at an author for doing what everyone regards as lawful and proper : writing anew an oft-told tale ; and in general these chapters present in good form and brief space what one finds more elabo - rately in
H. H. Bancroft	PERSON	's books , or more scien - tifically -LRB- if one may use an awkward term -RRB- in Professor
Garrison	PERSON	's volume in the `` American Nation Series . ''

		Professor
McElroy	PERSON	does not attempt to be exhaustive or final , and hence one must not apply the standards which might be applied to more ambitious writers .

		His aim is to re-present the subject , and to add to the national interest in and admiration for the leaders who brought such princely domains under the ample folds of the American flag .

		Of penetrating analysis or keen criticism of the materials used there is little ; nor is there anything '' new . ''

		* THE WINNING OF THE FAR WEST .

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL An opportunity for adding something to the store of our present knowledge of the far west - ward movement was offered in the unrecog - nized leadership of
Robert Walker	PERSON	, and in the amazing intrigues of the American diplomats in
Mexico	LOCATION	during the period just preceding the great war between the
States	LOCATION	.

		And there were certain features of the Mexican War which a more ambitious hand might have essayed to describe , though the author 's story of
Nicholas Trist	PERSON	and
General Scott	ORGANIZATION	is interesting and trustworthy .

		The following exchange of compliments be - tween General
Scott	PERSON	and
Nicholas Trist	PERSON	, the envoy of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, makes amusing reading now , though it must have been exas - perating indeed to the President , who would not punish either party .

		Scott : '' I see that the Secretary of War proposes to degrade me , by requiring that I , commander of this army , shall defer to you , the chief clerk of the De - partment of
State	ORGANIZATION	, the question of continuing or discontinuing hostilities . ''

		Trist : `` You will now , Sir , I trust , understand that greatly deficient in wisdom as the present -LRB- and indeed any democratic -RRB- administration of the govern - ment must necessarily be , it has not fallen into so egregious a blunder as to make the trans - mission and delivery of that communication -LSB- a message to the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs -RSB- dependent upon the amiable affabil - ity and gracious condescension of General
Winfield Scott	PERSON	. ''

		Few presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	ever contended with so many recalci - trant or unruly spirits as did
James K. Polk	PERSON	.

		One recalls
Scott	PERSON	, who openly snubbed the chief executive more than once ; Senator
Benton	PERSON	, who demanded of him almost impos - sible things ; and
Commodore Stockton	PERSON	, who declared in public addresses that nothing less than the annexation of all
Mexico	LOCATION	would sat - isfy any sensible man .

		Polk could not remove
Scott	PERSON	, lest
Benton	PERSON	, a civilian without military experience , should force his own nomination to the vacancy ; nor could he punish naval and army officers who clamored in public addresses for governmental action wholly inconsistent with the President 's policy .

		Eeally we have fallen upon better times .

		A most interesting subject is this of the win - ning of the far west ; but only a philosopher or an historian without national or sectional bias could possibly treat it aright .

		Think of
Colonel Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	describing the fall of the Alamo or the storming of
Chapultepec	LOCATION	, the '' imbecility of Polk , '' or the '' asinine stupid - ity '' of those who defeated the plan for
United States	ORGANIZATION	control of the
Panama	LOCATION	canal zone in
1846	DATE	!

		Of course , Professor
McElroy	PERSON	does not attempt the finality of
Roosevelt	LOCATION	, and conse - quently he leaves the reader in doubt now and then as to whether it was '' manifest destiny '' or something worse that dictated the course of our national evolution .

		To say that the story of the period still remains to be told is not to say that this book is a bad one ; on the con - trary , it is a handy and a reasonably accurate work -

		AMERICA AND THE GREAT WAR .

		* As the stream of books pertaining to the war flows from the presses of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	it brings at intervals a volume which by reason of the vigor of its thought and the force of its language stands some chance of retaining a place in the literature of the sub - ject a decade hence .

		Unquestionably , one such book is Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's ``
America	LOCATION	and the World War . ''

		Not that what the ex-President has written will commend itself to all classes of people .

		The '' peace prattlers , '' as the paci - vists are contemptuously denominated , will find small comfort in it ; and the defenders of the foreign policy of the
Wilson Administra	ORGANIZATION	- tion will not enjoy the flaying which is admin - istered to them .

		The book may be admitted at once to be partisan in tone and at some points distinctly unfair .

		Nevertheless , as a straight-from-the-shoulder exposition of the elements of strength and weakness in the pres - ent position of the
United States	LOCATION	, by a writer whose opportunities to acquire knowledge of the subject have been unsurpassed , Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- | velt 's volume must be regarded as one which j challenges the attention of every serious - | minded citizen .

		It is a book which , at the least , should be provocative of thought and of discussion .

		The course of the author 's argu - ment can be indicated in a few words .

		The
United States	LOCATION	should be equally friendly to all European peoples `` while they behave well , '' and should be considerate of the rights of each of them .

		Peace is ardently to be desired , but only as the handmaid of righteousness .

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, ; 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	'' ultra-pacivists '' during a generation past , have amounted to '' precisely and exactly nothing in advancing the cause of peace . ''

		All-inclusive arbitration treaties of the kind hitherto proposed and enacted are utterly worthless , are hostile to righteousness and detrimental to peace . ''

		From the international standpoint the essential thing to do is effec - tively to put the combined power of civiliza - tion back of the collective purpose of civiliza - tion to secure justice .

		This can be achieved only by a world league for the peace of right - eousness , which would guarantee to enforce by the combined strength of all the nations the decrees of a competent and impartial court against any recalcitrant and offending nation .

		Only in this way will treaties become serious documents . ''

		Such a world league for peace is not now in prospect .

		Until it can be brought about , the prime necessity for every free and liberty-loving nation is to keep itself in a state of preparedness such as to be able to defend by its own strength both its honor and its vital interest . ''

		The most important lesson for the
United States	LOCATION	to learn from the present war is the vital need that it shall at once take steps thus to prepare . ''

		The preparation which the author advocates includes the immediate strengthening of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, the enlargement of the regular army and the establishment of a reserve , and the inauguration of a certain amount of military training for all the young men of the country , after the manner prac - ticed in
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		A more temperate plea on the same lines is contained in General
Greene	PERSON	's '' Present Mili - tary Situation in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		This little book consists principally of an address delivered some months ago in
Portland	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, at the request of the
Economic Club	ORGANIZATION	of that city .

		In it the author recognizes that the hab - itual indisposition of the American people to think seriously upon the question of national defense has been both natural and inevitable .

		The chances of war have ever been , as they have been deemed , remote , and social and eco - nomic problems without number have usually seemed much more pressing .

		Within the past months , however , as was true in
1898	DATE	, our peo - ple have had their eyes opened to the fact , not only that war is not obsolete , but that the
United States	LOCATION	may well be less immune from its ravages than had been supposed .

		General
Greene	PERSON	asks simply that the occasion be taken advantage of to reckon up the facts of the existing situation and to derive any lessons that may be contained in them . ''

		There is no need , '' he says , `` of excitement about it , no cause for hysteria .

		We do not need and will not have in this country an army of 700,000 men , as some ill-balanced enthusiasts demand ; we are not compelled to , and we will not , enter the battleship race of
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		England must run this race or die .

		We are not so situated , and it would be supreme folly for us to waste our resources or our thoughts in any such contest . ''

		It is the judgment of the author that , notwithstanding the happen - ings of recent months , and barring a clash with
Mexico	LOCATION	, which would amount to little more than the exercise of police duty by our present forces , the possibility of a war in which the
United States	LOCATION	should be engaged is still remote .

		From
Japan	LOCATION	there is , he believes , very little danger ; at any rate , if war with that country comes , it will be '' made in Amer - ica . ''

		Still , there is a possibility of a Japanese clash , even as there is an insignificant chance of a conflict with one or both of the other two nations `` whose attack would be serious ''
Germany	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Arbitration has been proved to be not a cure-all .

		And , despite present appearances , we must yet believe that military preparedness , up to a certain point , does in the long run operate to prevent war .

		The conclusion at which the author arrives is that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, supported by the sentiment of the country , should accede to the requests con - tained in the last annual report of Secretary Garrison by increasing the mobile forces to 50,000 men and by taking the first steps toward the creation of a reserve .

		To any per - son desiring a temperate and well-informed presentation of our actual military status , such as can be read and pondered over at a sitting , this book can be commended .

		A volume traversing similar ground , but in a sketchy and somewhat frivolous manner , is Mr.
Howard D. Wheeler	PERSON	's `` Are We Ready ? ''

		The contents may have served some purpose when printed as a series of articles in ``
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' but they were hardly worth reproducing in book form .

		If one cares for an imaginative record of an attack on
New York	LOCATION	by `` the enemy , '' lent vividness by a lurid picture of Madison Square '' after an aerial raid , '' one will find it here .

		The writers of the volumes thus far men - tioned agree that at some time , and from some source , the
United States	LOCATION	may be involved in a great war .

		Professor Usher assumes more confidently the role of the prophet and boldly givesi his newest book the sub-title , `` A Forecast of the Inevitable Clash between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	's Victor . ''

		The
United States	LOCATION	, he tells us , is now facing a crisis with - out parallel in her history since the signing of the Declaration of Independence .

		It is not the causes of the European war that concern us .

		It is the ending of it ; for , '' whatever the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 339 result of this war may be , whoever wins it , whenever it ends , the victor will be able to threaten the
United States	LOCATION	, and , if he chooses , to challenge our supremacy in the Western Hemisphere . ''

		The decision which the
United States	ORGANIZATION	makes in relation to the questions thus suddenly thrust upon her is to be big with consequences .

		These questions , we are told , can not be evaded .

		There was a time when the country was defended by its isolation rather than by armies , and when we had little or no motive for interfering in international poli - tics .

		That day is past .

		Distance has been annihilated , and with the extension of our economic interests so that they cover the entire world the pursuit of firm and even aggressive policies has become a possibility , if not a necessity .

		The
United States	LOCATION	has been drawn into the broad current of international affairs , and can not expect longer to enjoy the advan - tages of aloofness .

		The great bone of conten - tion is to be
Latin America	LOCATION	.

		Of the two powers which alone , so far as
America	LOCATION	is concerned , can be victors in the war ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, both are known to be de - sirous of monopolizing Latin American trade ; and both , in the event of triumph in the pres - ent conflict , may be expected to be greedy for political dominion south of
Panama	LOCATION	.

		With the victor the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will inevitably be brought into conflict , and if there shall not be war there will be , at the least , grave danger of it .

		To have war it will not be necessary for the
United States	LOCATION	to become an aggressor ; she will need only to seek to maintain her present policy of trade extension and political hege - mony .

		The question of what , precisely , the
United States	LOCATION	should do in the emergency that now confronts her is propounded forcefully and discussed at much length but not fully answered .

		At least , it is answered negatively .

		We are told that `` we need not conclude of necessity that armament is our true recourse '' ; although the whole drift of the author 's argu - ment leads to the conclusion that the defense of the nation 's economic interests means a readiness to use force , and force means arma - ment .

		Another suggested course is the organiz - ing of a close Pan-American Confederation to protect the Western Hemisphere against
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope 's aggressor ; yet in a succession of chap - ters which form the most carefully considered portion of the book there is demonstrated in convincing manner -LRB- if it required demonstra - tion -RRB- the fact that differences of race , man - ners , and temperament are so fundamental as to preclude entirely the practicability of this plan .

		Of criticisms which suggest themselves to the reader , the most important relates to Professor Usher 's propensity for strong , and even startling , statements .

		It is true that assertions hardly less startling made in an i earlier book have been verified beyond all rea - j sonable expectation by the recent course of -LCB- events ; also that in an appendix to the pres - ent work Mr.
Usher	PERSON	acknowledges freely the necessary tentativeness of much of that which is said in the discussion of contemporary affairs .

		Nevertheless , in many portions of the text the fault of incautious statement appears .

		Issue may be taken with many specific asser - tions made .

		In respect to the methods by which her territorial dominion has been built i up , the
United States	LOCATION	is given a bill which is i too clean to be true .

		And in relation to the | major premise of the book one may query whether , after all , the war is likely to '' destroy that close balance of power in
Europe	LOCATION	upon which our past immunity from European in - terference has in large measure rested '' ; in other words , whether there will arise from the conflict any one `` victor '' so supremely tri - umphant as to be disposed to cast about at once , or soon , for a fresh field of conquest .

		There would seem to be a considerable chance that the ultimate outcome of the war will be so inconclusive that the American situation will not be greatly affected by it .

		Among books written by Americans upon the war in its more purely European aspects , one of rather unique character is Mr.
James M. Beck	PERSON	's '' The Evidence in the Case . ''

		Mr.
Beck	PERSON	is a lawyer , and he was a short while ago Assistant Attorney-General of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the present book he has brought to bear his legal temperament and talent upon the much discussed question of the moral re - sponsibility for the war .

		He enumerates his roster of witnesses the sovereigns , diplo - matic representatives , ministers , and other official spokesmen of the various belligerent nations .

		He then presents the record in the case , that is , the White Books , Yellow Books , Gray Books , etc. , and takes some account of the question of suppressed evidence .

		Finally , he examines critically the evidence and ar - rives at conclusions concerning all of the im - portant episodes and interchanges of the weeks in which the war was started .

		The judgment rendered is wholly adverse to
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, and doubtless by the partisans of those powers it will be pronounced unsup - ported and unjustifiable .

		It may be agreed that it bears an appearance of conclusiveness which neither Mr.
Beck	PERSON	nor any other man can really attain at the present juncture .

		Years , and probably decades , will elapse before all the evidence will be available and before the '' supreme court of civilization '' will render its final verdict upon the issues involved .

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	There have been published several other American books less judicial in tone and simi - larly anti-German .

		One is Mr.
Frederick W. Whitridge	PERSON	's `` One American 's Opinion of the European War , '' which is taken up chiefly with an explanation of the failure of the German ap - peals for American sympathy .

		Another is the anonymous volume , '' Can
Germany	LOCATION	`` Win ? ''

		The author of it , we are told , is an American citizen who has '' constantly been back and forth to
Germany	LOCATION	since the beginning of the war . ''

		The answer given to the question raised in the title is that , while
Germany	LOCATION	can win , and while she has unsuspected strength , the Allies also can win , provided
England	LOCATION	shall nerve herself to bear the brunt of the struggle .

		The author predicts that the war will be prolonged that before it ends `` there will have to be put in the field armies which are as yet unre - cruited and guns the designs for which have not yet been made . ''

		In his book entitled '' The War and Amer - ica , '' published last
autumn	DATE	, Professor Miin - sterberg gave expression to his well-known views concerning the righteousness of the cause of his native land in the conflict now in progress .

		In a volume just off the press , '' The Peace and
America	LOCATION	, '' he returns to the subject and renews his plea for a change of attitude on the part of Americans toward German statecraft , and especially toward the German Emperor .

		Intention or desire to be scholarly is specifically disclaimed , and only a purpose to be sincere is affirmed .

		Of sincerity the book bears satisfactory evidence .

		But the fact remains that it is simply a piece of special pleading , and that it can hardly be expected to change the opinions of any thinking person .

		It exhibits an irrepressible tendency to glorify
Germany	LOCATION	and everything German ; while non - German nations and peoples come off with mention only of their shortcomings .

		Such writing can have little interest save as a dem - onstration of how unscientific a scientific man , upon occasion , can be ; and demonstrations of this sort of thing have grown so numerous within the past six months that they may be supposed to have lost their power to cause surprise or comment .

		Finally may be mentioned a book of very different character , Mr.
Elbert F. Baldwin	PERSON	's '' The World War . ''

		Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	was in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope at the outbreak of the war , and his book comprises virtually a record of the occurrences that came under his observation as he moved from place to place , first on the Continent and later in
England	LOCATION	.

		Many chapters of the vol - ume were published in '' The Outlook '' shortly after the events which they recount took place .

		To one who desires a light sketch , in diary form , of the earlier stages of the conflict , the book may be commended .

		It comprises , not at all a history , but an interesting record of the impressions which
Europe	LOCATION	assembling in arms made upon a well-informed and conscientious American observer .

		SOME VARIED CONTRIBUTIONS TO PSYCHOLOGY .

		* The accumulations upon a reviewer 's table , with their chance conjunctions and opposi - tions , may at a favorable moment reflect the active trends and movements in the selected sphere of knowledge , and in so far be pro- phetic of its future development .

		In psychol - ogy , the salient impression is one of diversity a symptom of fertility .

		The psychological spirit is permeating inquiry in domains out - side the psychological territory , and is assum - ing new forms within it .

		In the technical field , more critically conducted , more elaborately equipped , and more ambitiously conceived projects are under way .

		Applications to edu - cation and to vocational pursuits are promi - nent , while the amplification of the first aids and the more advanced guides to the psycho - logically inquisitive proceeds with the multi - plication of chairs and students .

		The most notable recent contribution is Mr.
Shand	PERSON	's book , `` The Foundations of Charac - ter : A Study of the Tendencies of the Emo - tions and the Sentiments . ''

		Those familiar with this writer 's able papers in the English philosophical journals will realize the value of the systematic statement of his illuminating conceptions .

		The position implied by several psychologists , and nearly articulate in
James	LOCATION	, was first distinctly enunciated by Mr.
Shand	PERSON	and disseminated by its incorporation into Mr.
MacDougall	PERSON	's '' Social Psychology . ''

		The principle is that the emotions and the instincts of response form a mutually illuminating and unitary system of expression and direction .

Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 341 Fear is emotionally the flight -LRB- or other pro- tective -RRB- response instinctively ; anger emotion - ally is in terms of impulse a harder and more determined assault .

		With this clue the emo - tional nature finds its map in the organized impulses .

		But the boundaries , though largely natural features , are promptly rearranged by the acquired affiliations of the psychological realm .

		The wealth of impulses is their embar - rassment and their redemption .

		Fusion and competitions enter with increasing levels of complication .

		Most distinctively the emotions are played upon by intellectual elements and the products of their elaboration .

		Emotions thus mature as sentiments , and in that expan - sion find an outlet and the direction of their growth .

		Here and here alone , as the founda - tion of the psychical life , is established also the foundation of character , its only authentic psychological basis .

		Character is the total aspect of the organization of the endowment , and its focus is in the emotional life .

		A cen - tral point in the elaboration of this position is the clustering tendency of emotions and im - pulses , the manifold outlets and interactions of psychic trends .

		Such organization produces the system of the emotions and the system of the sentiments .

		Emotions are primary as they stand close to the definite regulation of vital responses or participate in their regulation , while about this original centre develop the supporting trends in ever-enlarging spheres of influence .

		In the secondary field lie the nice - ties of psychological issues and the actual arena of human qualities .

		With this admirable pro- gramme , Mr.
Shand	PERSON	has formulated a strong statement .

		Yet the source of its strength is also in a measure a hindrance , in that the fer - tility of the theme has produced an expansion of the material quite legitimate and interest - ing but confusing .

		The book is really three in one : a statement of the psychological develop - ment of character and its central emotional basis ; a descriptive and analytical account of the varieties of emotional functioning ; and a diagnostic elaboration of the finer '' aesthetic '' responsiveness of the sophisticated , particu - larly the moral agent .

		Each of these interests is well sustained , yet the singleness of purpose suffers .

		Keen diagnosis and suggestive dis - tinctions abound , and illustrations that really illustrate support an argument that is always adroitly handled .

		Yet so many principles are formulated , so many excursions -LRB- some of them discursive : hence a volume of five hundred pages -RRB- are undertaken that the trail is readily lost unless the reader is as keen in following as the writer in leading .

		The value of the volume lies in its psychological contribution to the analysis of the emotional life as a support of character on the basis of an illuminating , clear , and definite analysis .

		Its place in the standard literature of psychology is assured .

		Professor
Watson	PERSON	's volume sounds the '' Behaviorist '' note as a challenge to the con - servative psychologist .

		It also presents the results of careful research on animal responses , and a review of the present status of compara - tive psychology .

		To the behaviorist , the stone which the builders rejected has indeed become the corner-stone of the temple .

		If psychology will realize that consciousness is as dispensable as the soul , and if psychologists will experi - ment upon men as the behaviorists do upon animals , some practical results will be availa - ble and the lessons of psychology be respected .

		In the experimental field the series of re - searches reviewed , digested , and interpreted show more convincingly than has yet been done how rigid must be the conditions upon which sound conclusions may be drawn , especially when the object is to determine not alone how animals behave but upon what orders and varieties of distinctions their distinctive be - havior is founded .

		The technique involved in determining the color-perceptions of animals , and in registering the manner of their learn - ing their way through a maze , is an admirable example of the logical rigor of modern psychol - ogy .

		Professor
Watson	PERSON	is an equally trust - worthy guide in interpretation .

		His account of the highest forms of training yet reached in the animal mind is highly to be commended .

		It includes consideration of the marvellous horses whose performances are recorded in weighty volumes , the trained dogs that find equally enthusiastic champions , and the en - gaging chimpanzee whose anthropoid manners are quite deceptive .

		Yet all these stories carry a wholly different flavor and bearing when analyzed by the critical psychologist than when told by the proud trainer .

		The source of the satisfaction in believing that one 's own dog or horse or chimpanzee can do what no other horse or dog or chimpanzee can do , is itself a psychological trait worthy of explana - tion .

		If one contrasts this masterly study of Professor
Watson	PERSON	's with such books equally representative in their day as those of Bo - manes , one appreciates the important advances which this phase of the study of mind -LRB- or , to satisfy the behaviorists , conduct -RRB- has made in recent years .

		No more striking contrast to the direct ob - jectivism of the behaviorists could be found than the involved subjectivism of the Freudian tendency in psychology .

		Dr.
Freud	PERSON	's thesis has become a common topic of informal as well as informed conversation , while the practice of psycho-analysis caters to the interests of those 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	fond of viewing personal details in an engag - ing light .

		The thesis holds that trifles are significant because uncensored , and that the mind is a maze of suppressed and distorted motives ; that lapses are not accidents but re - pressions , usually with a sex clue ; that dis - agreeable things are put out of the mind to hide the trace of our guilt , though it will out when the psycho-analyst gets you .

		Dr.
Freud	PERSON	's '' Psychopathology of Everyday Life '' is now accessible in a good translation made by Dr.
A. A. Brill	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, a prominent repre - sentative of the Freudian practitioners .

		The volume carries the thesis to such common inci - dents as forgetting a name , a foreign word , an impression ; as mis-speaking and mis - writing ; as doing things unintentionally , or other types of lapses , faults , and habits .

		In all these there is method in one 's momentary madness , the secret of which lies in the unconscious and unsuspected if not disowned past , which is retired in the interests of the present .

		The thesis is attractive , though the details are often tedious ; some parts of the book read like the inflated notes of an ingenious mind .

		But is this the true picture of the normal course of the mind 's daily habit ; and are we deceivers ever , for lack of better subjects deceiving our - selves ?

		Doubtless privacy is essential to psy - chical complexity , and reticence grows even to an obsession in an ingrown mind .

		But to ban - ish the casual from psychology is to deny it small talk and vacations , and to make recrea - tion a misnomer .

		A jest , it is true , often masks a deeper purpose ; and yet the spirit of it is for the most part just fun .

		If sleep were always a sojourn in a chamber of Freudian dreams , it might be more restful to remain awake ; while with the best of intentions and an adequate psychological insight many a psy - chologist can find in his own errors and slips and gaucheries nothing but stupidity , defec - tive observation , brain wandering , and the idlest of fancies .

		That a slight tinge of abnor - mality may readily give the mind a Freudian twist , or that an intellectual over-introspec - tiveness not quite adequately supported by critical control may do the same , is a plausible view .

		But that such an occasional interlude dominates or does anything but intrude seems questionable .

		To certain temperaments , be - tween the dark and the daylight of health or mood there comes a lull in the mind 's occupa - tion that is known as the Freudian hour .

		As painstaking as the studies of animal be - havior are the records of the feeble-minded contained in Dr.
Henry H. Goddard	PERSON	's authori - tative volume .

		The conspicuous lesson of the three hundred and more cases of mental defect here recorded is the inevitably hereditary char - acter of the taint , and to a remarkable degree -LRB- considering the complexity of the data -RRB- their conformity to the requirements of Mendelian heredity .

		The defect is of many degrees , and is best expressed by the mental age as revealed by special tests and general conduct .

		The idiot has the mentality of a three-year old or even of a less mature child ; imbecility carries on the development to six or seven years ; while the lighter grades of defect and the moron show an irregular capacity comparable in many re - spects to that of a normal child of nine , ten , or eleven years .

		Here development stops , though physical growth -LRB- itself at times stunted -RRB- con - tinues .

		Some cases deceive even the expert teacher , and encourage him to look for a nearly normal issue , when progress sets in ; but there is always disappointment in the end .

		The story stops and the limitations of heredity are final .

		The moral of the silk purse and the sow 's ear remains .

		This lesson is an unwel - come one to an optimistic democracy , to which opportunity is a solvent or a magic potion , and native ability a disturbing intrusion into a well-ordered society of unobtrusive equals .

		The lesson may be extended : for it implies that for every score of high-grade defectives , there must be hundreds of just higher endow - ment who form the great armies of the dull and dense to whom the work of the world must be adjusted .

		It is the poor in intelligence that we shall always have with us .

		The problem of incompetence is scarcely as serious to the social philanthropist as the problem of crime , so much of which is due to mental defect .

		A high-grade defective leads a safe life in the sheltered environment of the
Vineland	LOCATION	School ; the environment of a city dooms him utterly ; and society pays the bill in the cost of crime and institutional care .

		In this field the eu - genic argument is convincing ; if we can not as yet secure the best parentage , we can cut off the worst .

		Dr.
Goddard	PERSON	's tables are illumi - nating , as are in general his interpretations of the several conditions which aggravate the menace of mental defect .

		The modern note dominates the volume , giving it the flavor of a laboratory study , a case record , or a field report .

		Dr.
Goddard	PERSON	has also reported upon the pro- visions for '' The School Training of Defective Children , '' and the means to be taken for their recognition and special consideration in the public schools .

		Dr.
Wallace Wallin	PERSON	's volume on '' The Mental Health of the School Child '' con - tains a series of careful studies -LRB- reprinted from the technical magazines -RRB- dealing with special aspects of the educational and the psy - chological questions that arise in the care and study of the mentally defective .

		Special at -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 tention is directed to the hereditary aspects of the problems -LRB- eugenics -RRB- , and to the corrective measures -LRB- euthenics -RRB- , that promise the relief of these unfortunate conditions inherent in the distribution of human quality .

		The very title of Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	's book , '' Relig - ious Confessions and Confessants , '' seems a refutal of the Freudian principles of suppres - sion , yet it is actually its complement .

		For the relief which the psycho-analyst releases is by way of confession , by way of a verbal ex - plicitness which , like the flow of tears , finds a vent for pent-up tension .

		Nature and religion are sympathetic psychologists .

		Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	's essay is an able venture in a difficult field .

		It requires a comprehensive historical grasp of the moving centuries and the setting which they give to the documents in the case , and a psychological grasp of the underlying affinities of expression and mood , despite the local color and the imposed limitations of their origin .

		The result is a contribution of sterling value .

		The written confession is a phase of the auto - biographical intention -LRB- the subject of an ear - lier volume by Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	-RRB- which , if carried out with Dantesque singleness of purpose , would approach the inviolable sanctity of the psycho - analytic moment .

		The tenuous duplicity is involved in the intention to be read , in the extreme reaching
Heine	PERSON	's satirical view of feminine writers who are described as having one eye on the manuscript and the other on a man .

		The religious confessant has least temp - tation to be a poseur ; for despite the protean type , he or she has the courage of self-knowl - edge that divides between the lure of introspec - tion and the shriving self-communion .

		The most naive or candid or healthy-minded -LRB- as
James	PERSON	would say -RRB- of the confessants are the Gurneys -LRB- one of the many
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	records which Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	has incorporated in her re - searches -RRB- , for whom meditating and journal - izing were the family dogmas ; the young ladies of the family intermingle reflection upon God and a future state with attention to very worldly and innocent pleasures .

		The central portion of the volume is inductive , and pre - sents an array of data the interpretation of which , despite the contrasting setting of time and place and religious affiliation , results in an orderly set of conclusions .

		The correlation of feeble health with introspective intensity is clear , as is also the special relation of periods of decline in physical vigor with moments of conversion .

		The encouragement of the environ - ment , the strong hereditary trend , the precipi - tation of the crisis by gripping experiences , the vestigial character of the manifestations , the influence of the group contagion , all these play a part in the genesis of the varieties of religious experience of which the confessions are an expression .

		The trends that lead to mysticism , to introspective indulgence , to an ascetic self-castigation , as well as those illus - trating the abnormal hazards of the mind -LRB- such as the witchcraft confessions and accusa - tions -RRB- , further extend the scope of the inquiry .

		By a discerning combination of the inductive method so variously fruitful in modern psy - chology with a sympathetic insight into the significance of very complex phases of the inner life conferred by a well-trained histori - cal sense , Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	has made a valuable con - tribution to the psychology of the religious life .

		The strong if not dominant sociological trend in recent psychology is well represented by Mr.
Graham Wallas	PERSON	's '' The Great Society , '' which he properly terms `` A Psychological Analysis . ''

		The '' great society '' is the result of the radical reconstruction of the forces of social control brought about by the extension of mechanical aids and economic development and the insight into the forces responsible for human progress .

		Conscious evolution has replaced subconscious strivings and groping subjection to forces beyond control because beyond the ken of attained comprehension .

		What remains permanent is the dominance of the fundamental psychological trends which have brought mankind slowly to the present stage .

		Habit , fear , pleasure and pain , the so - cial impulses leading to love and hatred , and the trend of thought intertwining weakly among them and in later stages supporting the total growth , these were and are the actual forces competing in society for expression and organization .

		As one or another of these origi - nal trends is made central , there arise '' habit '' societies and a '' habit '' psychology among the students of human affairs ; similarly a '' fear '' society and a '' fear '' psychology ; a '' sympa - thy '' society and a `` sympathy '' psychology ; a '' thought '' society and a '' thought '' psychol - ogy .

		Mr.
Wallas	PERSON	's volume is a popular one , and the theme is reduced to the sharp contrasts alone possible when a coarse brush is used .

		The effect is impressionistic but strong .

		It is signifi - cant that a student of society finds it essential to present his views on the basis of a careful psychological analysis of the motive sources of human conduct ; though it must be admitted that his strong interest in social trends of the day make his transitions from principle to con - clusion somewhat violent or detached .

		We all look upon the tendencies operative here and now through the powerful microscope of prac - tical interest ; the corrective of the large evolu - tionary distance is indispensable .

		Mr.
Wallas	PERSON	's practical motive is to influence opinion in the 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	organization of thought and will .

		The sociolo - gist often runs away with the psychologist .

		It is important that a book of this type shall be available , because so many persons are busy with one or another aspect of the problem of social control , and these require a presenta - tion suitable to their needs and habits of com - prehension .

		In the .

		psychological view , the European catastrophe -LRB- which , by the way , is foreshadowed by Mr.
Wallas	PERSON	with a startling prophetic insight -RRB- is far less a battle of arma - ments than a contest of ideals .

		The decision at stake is the perspective of importance to be assigned to the directive trends of human na - ture in the socially matured system under which life must proceed .

		For the making of texts in psychology , classes and publishers are largely responsible , unless the inadequacy of professors ' salary is the efficient cause .

		Such texts must usually be reviewed from the pedagogical aspect : Will the student mind accept them and profit by their use ?

		It is safe to predict that whatever Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	writes will reflect the fertility of his versatile endowment and the comprehensiveness of his command of the sub - ject .

		To the teacher of psychology his latest text-book will be distinctly helpful .

		It is a well-sustained presentation , and differs from many texts in its inclusion of applied psychol - ogy in a readable survey of education , law , medicine , industry , and culture , as they em - body psychological principles and their work - ings .

		What is ordinarily incidentally noted in connection with analysis is here brought to a systematic presentation .

		As for the adapta - bility of the text to the student , one man 's view or guess is doubtless no better than another 's .

		It seems to the present reviewer that the stu - dent 's reaction to this type of text will be either neutral or belligerent .

		It seems pecu - liarly neglectful of the psychology of the stu - dent 's mind ; and it errs in one essential respect an error almost scholastic in its temper : namely , the insistence upon `` methodology . ''

		The division of `` causal psychology '' and '' purposive psychology , '' the contrast of '' the two psychologies , '' is the very basis of the book .

		This is precisely what the student should not be troubled with ; it is the teacher 's business to conceal the fact that he is troubled by it him - self .

		It is in despite of the plan of the volume , rather than by virtue of it , that the result is valuable .

		Professor
Ogden	PERSON	writes his '' Introduction to General Psychology '' with the literal purpose of surveying the essentials of the field in the briefest possible compass .

		This involves a sum - mary manner throughout , even to the sugges - tion of the replacement of the notes which a brilliant student might adapt to his own pur - poses .

		With the purpose so definitely con - ceived , and the position -LRB- approximately that of the Wiirzburg movement in psychology -RRB- equally pronounced , the execution follows the perspective of importance which the several topics are assigned in the instructor 's mind .

		The divisions are clear : an analytical review ; a synthetic construction ; an applicational sur - vey .

		All this has been done with skill , patience , discretion .

		A survey , like the present review , which in - cludes in one sheaf the psychology of charac - ter , of obscure moments in every-day life , of religious experience in autobiographical data , of the defective classes , of the social move - ments of the day and generation , is sufficient to indicate the perplexities of the writer of texts who wishes to present the established doctrines and to reflect the current trends of interest .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has scored again with `` An - gela 's Business , '' although not quite as effec - tively as with its two predecessors .

		The hero lives in some idyllic town where it is possible for him to earn , as a private tutor , not merely a living , but the means of providing for a luxurious apartment , and the services of a private secretary .

		He is also by way of being a writer of novels and short stories , but as these effusions are almost invariably returned to him with complimentary regrets by unap - preciative editors and publishers , they do not contribute materially to the elucidation of the economic mystery of his existence .

		The chief subject of his researches as a fictionist is Woman , which he thinks he understands in all its manifestations , and he jots down felicitous epigrams about it as they occur to him .

		He eventually discovers that his psychology has been superficial , and that intimate emotional relations with individual specimens of the sex must enter into a novelist 's equipment before he is really qualified to write about it .

		His chief personal contacts are with the two speci - mens
Angela	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	.

		The latter is a some - what strenuous creature of the type commonly known as `` advanced , '' a teacher in the local high school , whose chief ambition is to secure the secretaryship of a national educational organization .

New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 345 feminine and appealing .

		Her '' business , '' un - blushingly avowed , is that of being a '' home - maker , '' which means that she is primarily bent upon ensnaring a suitable male with whose aid to construct the home of her imaginings .

		It looks as if the hero were destined to become her prey , but
Mary	PERSON	is the one who finally car - ries him off , a success to which we are not alto - gether reconciled .

		The author brings this about by a series of deft moves whereby Mary grows upon us and
Angela	PERSON	grows away from us , the former developing hitherto unsuspected qualities of womanliness , while the latter is revealed as the embodiment of selfish calcula - tion and insincerity .

		She does not exactly appear in the character of a minx or a cat , but her development is obviously tending in that direction at the time when the hero discovers that
Mary	PERSON	is the realization of his ideals , and informs her of the conclusion that he has reached .

		The manner in which this story is related is sparkling and whimsical ; it is far from being a remarkable novel in any serious sense , but it is undeniably an entertaining one . ''

		Ruggles of Red Gap , '' by Mr.
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	, is the story of an English valet trans - planted to the wilds of western
America	LOCATION	.

		His master , the Honorable
George	PERSON	-LRB- surname unin - dicated -RRB- , enticed into a game of '' drawing poker '' by some Americans visiting in
London	LOCATION	, stakes
Ruggles	PERSON	and loses him , which means that the valet must depart with his new master for
Red Gap	ORGANIZATION	, which seems to be a metropolis situated among the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	.

		The saying that men change their skies but not their souls is measurably illustrated by Rug - gles 's career in his new surroundings , but he finds himself , despite his efforts to keep his place , elevated by circumstance into a social position of some consequence in Red Gap , and when we take leave of him , he is by way of developing into a passable imitation of an American citizen .

		His experiences are sur - prising , and often farcical , but he remains un - perturbed by a rise in the world of which he could not have dreamed in the early days be - fore he became the arbiter elegantiarum of Red Gap society .

		The story abounds in a species of humor of which the following is a typical specimen : u I gathered at once that the Americans have actually named one of our colonies '
Washington	LOCATION	' after the rebel
George Washington	PERSON	, though one would have thought that the indelicacy of this would have been only too apparent .

		But , then , I recalled as well the city where their so-called par - liament assembles ,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. Doubtless the initials indicate that it was named in ' honour ' of another member of this notorious family .

		I could not but reflect how shocked our King would be to learn of this effrontery . ''

		A little of this sort of thing goes a long way , and such humor rather palls when supplied in the generous measure with which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	bestows it upon us .

		It will be a long time before we get the real fiction of the great war such work , for ex - ample , as ''
Richard Dehan	PERSON	'' and Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	have it in them to write .

		Meanwhile , those among our novelists whose aim is pri - marily entertainment are rapidly seizing the new opportunity , and giving us episodical tales of essentially private and sentimental interest , having the war as a decorative background .

		Such stories are the `` Who Goes There ! ''

		of Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	and the `` Little Comrade '' of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The former is the more serious and full-bodied of the two , but we expect something much better of the writer to whom we owe the series based upon the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian War and the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	puts his historical judgments of the war into three prefatory pages of prose and verse , leaving them otherwise to be in - ferred from the action of the romance that follows .

		His verse yields such a picture as this of martyred
Belgium	LOCATION	: '' Withered the magic gardens which were mine ;
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, in embers , blackens in the sun ; Rooting amid crushed roses the Wild Swine Still root , and spare not one . ''

		In his prose he gives a succinct statement of the reasons why
America	LOCATION	can have no sym - pathy for the German cause , concluding with these words : `` We know that the cause of
Imperial Germany	LOCATION	is wrong ; her civilization is founded on propositions impossible for any American to accept ; her aims , ambitions , and ideals are antagonistic to the progress of com - munal and individual liberty as we understand the terms .

		And that settles the matter for us . ''

		The hero of '' Who Goes There ! ''

		is an Amer - ican of Belgian descent , who is about to take his place in the Belgian army when the coun - try of his ancestry is violated by the barbarian .

		Taken prisoner by General
Baron von Reiter	PERSON	, he is reprieved on the condition that he will go to
England	LOCATION	and rescue the
General	ORGANIZATION	's ward , and escort her to his
Luxembourg	LOCATION	estate .

		Failing this , he promises , like
Regulus	ORGANIZATION	, to come back and be shot .

		He finds the young woman , and sets out with her for
the Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		But she is already under suspicion of being a German spy , and has , in fact , certain important ' papers revealing the whereabouts of the English fleet and other matters .

		Every step of the journey is dogged , and there are many exciting escapes from arrest .

		As for the compromising papers , the hero gains possession of them , and thus prevents them from falling into the hands of the enemy .

		The General , who has hoped to 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	wed the young woman , finds , when they meet , that the American has stolen her heart , and , in a hand-to-hand encounter , is badly wounded .

		Thereupon , with incredible magnanimity , he relinquishes his suit , and provides the lovers with every facility for going over the lines into
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		The expected happy romantic ending is inferred rather than portrayed .

		The story has an excess of the conversational pad - ding at which Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is an adept , but it has also much dramatic action and a quan - tum satis of sentimental interest .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's story is of the thinnest tex - ture , and is also concerned with the romance of an American hero and a beautiful spy .

		This girl is from
Strasbourg	LOCATION	, and has in her possession some plans of the fortifications at
Metz	ORGANIZATION	, which she hopes to place in the hands of
General Joffre	ORGANIZATION	.

		The police are on her track , and she flings herself into the arms of the American hero , a surgeon on his way home from
Vienna	LOCATION	, and caught in
Aachen	LOCATION	at the out - break of the war .

		A deft manipulation of his passport adds to his name the words '' accom - panied by his wife , '' and upon this pretence , she persuades him to extend to her his protec - tion .

		The pair have a lively time in getting across the Belgian frontier , and have to hide in wheat-fields and gullies , make forced marches by night , and swim the Meuse .

		They are both wounded , but evade capture , and the hero takes the plans to the French camp , where the invisible ink is made to yield up its secrets .

		We leave the heroine in a German hospital , where she is being nursed back to health with - out any suspicion of her real character on the part of the authorities , and we are left to imagine the reunion with the man to whom she owes her safety .

		She makes a very charming and resourceful heroine , and the ingenuity with which she extricates herself from difficult situations excites our deepest admiration .

		What the author thinks about the whole busi - ness of the war is made fairly evident by his hero 's comments upon the invasion of Bel - gium , and by his offer of his professional services to the French army .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Something of
Frank Stockton	PERSON	's delightful irre - sponsibility and inconsecutiveness appear in Miss
Ellenor Stoothoff	PERSON	's `` The Nightingale '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , which tells of a
New England	LOCATION	wife and mother who flies from home and family to effect her own cure from a serious attack of nerves by rambling unprotected through
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
Italy	LOCATION	she takes on a young girl as maid , and adopts two lambs .

		These latter ail slightly , - so she embarks for the spot where
Southdown	ORGANIZATION	mutton comes from , as possessing the climate necessary for their well - being .

		It has been understood between her and her complaisant husband that she will return when she hears a nightingale sing .

		He , after what he regards as a sufficient deprivation , arrives in
Paris	LOCATION	, where he buys what he is told is a nightingale , and takes it over to her in
England	LOCATION	that she may hear its song and justify his arrival .

		She , meanwhile , has been acting the part of a beneficent fate for various lov - ers , one of them a plumber and the other a chauf - feur .

		It is all pleasantly plausible and amusing .

		What an intelligent husband and wife can do in avoiding divorce by removing the causes for sepa - ration is set forth by
M. Henry Bordeaux	PERSON	in '' The Awakening '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , which has been translated by Miss
Ruth Helen Davis	PERSON	from the ninety-fifth edition in French .

		A brilliant writer marries a charming girl , who , having borne him a son and daughter , is quite content to rest on her ante - marital laurels so far as charm is concerned .

		An - other woman , brilliantly intellectual , crosses the writer 's path after years of baffled hopes and an almost complete waning of mutual interests .

		The outraged wife returns to her people and begins a suit for separation , holding herself innocent of the collapse of their married life .

		A diary kept by him is placed in her hands , and her failure to meet his ambitions is made clear thereby .

		She sets about rehabilitating herself in her own eyes , thus opened ; and in the course of years attains to her husband 's standard of what a wife should be .

		The book deserves wide reading .

		Mrs.
Edith Henrietta Fowler	PERSON	's latest romance , `` Patricia '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has a genuine , if somewhat worldly , piety running through its pages .


Patricia	PERSON	is the only daughter of an eminent man of letters , widowed at her birth .

		His death sends her to an uncle , vicar of a rural parish , as earnest and gener - ous of self as he and his family are narrow .

		The girl 's impressions of religion as a dull and rather sordid business are confirmed by the life her kins - folk lead , her agnostic training blinding her to the spiritual beauty beneath .

		She is awakened by her love for a clergyman of high rank , who takes her into a society even more cultivated than her father had thrown about her , and eventually brings her to the Light .

		Patricia is an excellent example of a witty simpleton , to say nothing worse of her ; but her slightness of character detracts little from the interest of the story .

		In the death of Monsignor
Hugh Benson	PERSON	,
the Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	has lost the ablest novelist in her cause she has ever had in
England	LOCATION	; and his posthumous story , `` Loneliness '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , serves to confirm this fact .

		It deals with contemporary life , and its protagonist is a young Catholic English - woman who achieves a marked success on the oper - atic stage .

		This success so interests the scion of a recently ennobled house that he secretly affiances himself to her .

		Meanwhile her youthful devotion to religion grows pallid , until she determines to marry her Protestant lover regardless of churchly regulations .

		A slight surgical operation deprives her of her glorious voice ; she turns to the old religion and dismisses her lover , now grown luke - warm , and the close suggests the cloister .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 347 It is inevitable that the fascinating figure of the fourth Amen-hotep , self-named Akhenaton , should be connected with that of
Moses	PERSON	, since the purity of the
Pharoah	PERSON	's religion bears no slight resem - blance to that of the great Jewish lawgiver .

		Cer - tain chronological obstacles have not been allowed to stand in the way by Mr.
Frederick Thurstan	PERSON	in `` The Romances of Amosis Ra '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , the hero of which is none other than Moses himself .

		Such portions of the Scripture as could be made to fit are utilized to the full , and a magical atmosphere is created , in the spirit of the miracles of the exo - dus .

		The romances are two , the first ending with the birth of the prophet , the second with his retire - ment to the land of Midian after his slaughter of the Egyptian .

		The author 's earnestness and learn - ing are much in excess of his ability to write convincingly . ''

		The Graves at
Kilmorna	LOCATION	: A Story of '67 '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is an earnest tale of the abortive uprising of the Irish against British oppression in
1867	DATE	, when veterans of the American Civil War returned to their native land to assist in obtaining its independence .

		It is the work of the Very Rev.
Canon P. A. Sheehan	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, and is a close and con - clusive picture of the times in which it begins , and a profound criticism of these later days .

		A youth - ful Irish idealist and freedom worshipper seeks death in the cause in order that his countrymen may gain the stimulus that he believes will follow this voluntary martyrdom .

		His life is spared , but he spends ten agonizing years in prison before he is pardoned .

		The end of the tale is tragic in every sense of the word .

		Few more sincere stories have been written of Irish Catholic life .


Spain	LOCATION	in the days of the weak and unfortunate
Philip IV.	PERSON	, with his prime minister ,
Olivares	PERSON	, as the leading figure , provides the scene for Miss
Amelia Josephine Burr	PERSON	's `` A Dealer in Empire '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A beautiful girl , niece to a celebrated actress and herself successful in her brief career upon the stage , furnishes the necessary appeal to the sensibilities .

		She is beloved by a young nobleman and by the King himself , but yields herself rather to the higher appeal made by the minister , to whom she bears a son .

		His ambitions take him from her , and place her in retirement .

		The conclusion is admirably worked out , in accordance with ideas of sentimental justice .

		Simple and easy in style , direct and com - pact in substance , this is an historical novel fully romanticized .

		Miss Mary Bride reappears with all her common - sensible charm in Mr.
Edgar Jepson	PERSON	's '' Happy Pollyooly '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; as do also her small brother '' The Lump , '' her employer the bar - rister , and nearly all the other personages of the story of which this is the sequel .

		Pollyooly is a most engaging young person who has the knack of coming safely out of all adventures , however com - plicated , and always with a substantial sum of money in her possession .

		There is a somewhat long-drawn-out episode having to do with a prince of the
House of Hohenzollern	ORGANIZATION	which , vce fear , does injustice to that doughty line 's conceptions of education .

		BRIEFS ONJNEW BOOKS .

		At desolate
Babylon	LOCATION	, once mis - tress of Hither
Asia	LOCATION	, excavations by the Royal Museums of
Berlin	LOCATION	in conjunction with the
Deutsche Orient	ORGANIZATION	-
Gesellschaft	ORGANIZATION	have been in progress since
1899	DATE	.

		An account of net results up to the
spring of 1912	DATE	, written by Dr.
Robert Koldewey	PERSON	, in charge of the work , and first published in
1913	DATE	, has already reached its third German edition .

		The hoped-for English version is also now available in a volume entitled `` The Excava - tions at Babylon '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mrs.
Agnes S. Johns	PERSON	has made a free and idiomatic trans - lation which well reproduces the effect of the original .

		Awkward sentences occur rarely , likewise minor discrepancies of fact .

		Suc - cessive discussions of the separate features of the city form the bulk of the volume ; a retro - spect sums up the career of Babylon as a whole .

		Its site was inhabited even in prehis - toric times -LRB- pp. 88 , 261 , 311 -RRB- .

		The water - level , however , higher now than in antiquity , prevents excavating below the stratum of Hammurabi -LRB- 2123-2081 B.C. -RRB- , the great law - giver of the
Babylonian First Dynasty	ORGANIZATION	.

		The residence district of Merkes best reveals the course of
Babylon	LOCATION	's history , from the early state of Hammurabi down through the inglo - rious
Kassite	PERSON	sway and the period of Assy - rian domination to the Chaldean empire of
Nebuchadnezzar	ORGANIZATION	and beyond .

		For that empire succumbed to the Persians -LRB- 538 B.C. -RRB- , who in turn fell before
Alexander	PERSON	-LRB- 331 B.C. -RRB- .

		The Greek period was followed by the Par - thian -LRB- 139 B.C. -RRB- , the latter by the Sassanide -LRB- A.D. 226 -RRB- .

		Scattered dwellings existed in Merkes far down into the Arabic period -LRB- be - gan in 636 -RRB- , perhaps as late as A.D. 1200 .

		Since then , however , the whole site of the ancient city has been deserted .

		As the Assy - rian
Sennacherib	ORGANIZATION	had razed Babylon in 689
B.C.	LOCATION	, the most imposing remains discoverable begin with the brilliant reign of
Nebuchadnez	PERSON	- zar -LRB- 604-561 B.C. -RRB- , when the rebuilt city was most populous .

		During the Persian period the
Euphrates	LOCATION	- occupied a new channel , thus producing the configuration known to
Herodo	LOCATION	- tus and Ctesias .

		The English publishers have included all the illustrations of the German volume .

		But they have used thicker and less highly calendered paper , so that the copious half-tone plates have lost decidedly in bril - liance .

		A reduction in size of page has neces - sitated folding the colored plate fig. 64 , which has also been interchanged with fig. 80 .

		The worst feature of the English volume is the fragile binding , which gives way upon first opening the book .

		On the other hand , one is glad to note the addition of running title and 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 29	DATE	index .

		The thirteen years ' accomplishments summarized in `` The Excavations at Baby - lon '' represent about one half of the total task .

		Accounts of further progress are avail - able in German only , in the bulletins of the
Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even now the work continues , for in spite of the war Dr.
Koldewey	PERSON	returned
last November	DATE	to his field .

		Whether the excavation of the city is ever to be finished can not now be foretold .

		Until that consummation is attained , the present volume will be indispensable to those who seek acquaintance with ancient Babylon .

		In the poetic opera , `` Fairyland '' A successful -LRB- y j
University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr. American opera .

		JL .

		TT .

		- ' . ' '


Brian Hooker	PERSON	has given us an alluring text which demands at every point of its development a musical setting .

		If the book had not been written so that Mr.
Horatio W. Parker	PERSON	might illuminate it with his mature and effective art , it would have solicited infal - libly the services of some other musician to accomplish what has been done by the master of orchestral investiture at
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fairyland presented in this drama is not the Shakespearean forest of the `` Midsummer Night 's Dream . ''

		Titania and
Oberon	PERSON	have no part in it .

		The story and significance connect themselves more directly with
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and his remarkable plays .

		There is the old anti- thesis of ecclesiastical domination on the one side and governmental tyranny on the other ; between these two , human life is crushed as between the upper and nether millstones .

		Liberation is brought about through the eleva - tion of the great body of mankind , and the normal happiness of ennobled daily life is set above all artificial and oppressive distinctions .

		This theme is presented in a well conceived form , picturesque , simple , interesting .

		Mr.
Hooker	PERSON	's '' Fairyland '' is the realm of human nature 's daily experiences , in the regular proc - esses of the diurnal round , sincerely pursued for ends that are beneficent and purifying , the completeness of love and sacrifice .

		This does not mean that the book is a moral allegory .

		The sensuous appeal is there , the story and the pictures are sufficient , the characters awaken admiration and comment , the poetry is melo - dious , and the echoes of internal meaning sur - round it with a rich and luminous atmosphere .

		We have not had as yet the opportunity of see - ing the score , but the play seems well adapted to the general tendencies of Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's work ; and this opera , the second by the same author and composer to win a notable prize , ought to find audiences that will rejoice in its romantic color and movement .

		If here is an exemplifi - cation of what
America	LOCATION	is to do in musical drama , we may look forward hopefully to the evolution of an art that will not need to hide its diminished head before the achievements of other lands and times .

		Even the most unemotional of A posthumous .

		.

		, volume by reviewers must admit that with
Sister Nivedita	ORGANIZATION	.

		some ^ QQ ^ sympathy is the only exegete ; and in
Sister Nivedita	LOCATION	's `` Footfalls of Indian History '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- we have a striking instance .

		One can not fail to note in the volume many out-and-out mistakes , and a still greater number of controverted points as - sumed as unquestioned truths ; yet one leaves the volume with the feeling that this gifted Irish woman , who became such a thorough - going convert to
Hinduism	LOCATION	, has given us gener - ous fare .

		At the same time it is difficult to say just what group of readers would care for the book as a whole .

		To most people a stronger appeal will be made by such papers as `` A Study of
Benares	LOCATION	'' and '' The History of
India	LOCATION	and Its Study '' than by the chapters on '' The Ancient Abbey of Ajanta '' or '' The Cities of Buddhism '' ; but the latter type represents the genuinely valuable work of the author .

		Naturally , one must always make allowance for her preconceptions that
Hinduism	LOCATION	is trans - cendentally noble and that there is a national unity of
India	LOCATION	; but when this has been done , the reader will find that her work is careful and conscientious , and based on a serious study alike of the monuments and of the standard authorities .

		The volume is illustrated by ex - cellent photographs and plans , as well as by six colored plates of real merit , reproducing water-colors from the brushes of
Gaganendra Nath Tagore	PERSON	and
Nanda Lai Bose	ORGANIZATION	.

		Inasmuch as
Miss Noble	ORGANIZATION	's books are gradually reaching a wider circle , it would seem that the volume might have given us a brief account of her life and writings , and of her death some four years ago .

		In itself this would make most interesting reading , as well as being a real convenience for such readers as are gaining their first acquaintance with this remarkable woman .

		In a disinterested effort to save at least a little Latin from the engulfing flood of anti-classic - ism , Mr.
E. Parmalee Prentice	PERSON	, who will be remembered for his prominence in the Am - herst movement against undue intrusion of the sciences into the field of academic culture , has followed up his last year 's publication of
Ruskin	PERSON	's `` The King of the
Golden River	LOCATION	, '' in Dr.
Arcadius Avellanus	PERSON	's Latin translation , with a second book of diverting fiction in the same tongue and from the same translator .

		This time choice has been made of the learned Modern fiction in Latin dress .

David-Leon Cahun	PERSON	's story of ancient mari - time adventure which bears , in the original , the following descriptive title : `` Les aven - tures du
Capitaine Magon	PERSON	, ou une exploration phenicienne mille ans avant 1 ` ere chretienne . ''

		In its classical dress , under the title , ' '
Pericla Navarchi Magonis	PERSON	, '' the work forms the first volume of a courageously projected series , `` Mount Hope Classics , '' issued , says Mr.
Prentice	PERSON	, primarily for his own children , but very gladly furnished by him to such pur - chasers as may take an interest in his laudable and by no means lucrative enterprise .

		The Latin is not exactly Ciceronian , but none the less serviceable for that reason , and perhaps even more readily intelligible ; certainly it is not difficult , and the sensation of finding one - self actually drawn along , page after page , by the interest of the narrative will be novel to more than one who , in his time , has been moved to sighs and groans by the elegant
Tully	ORGANIZATION	's formidable periods .

		Captain Mago 's stirring adventures fill more than three hun - dred octavo pages , and are followed by twenty pages of author 's and translator 's notes , which need not , however , halt the progress of the reader enraptured with the brisk movement of the tale .

		A natural query will be prompted by the announcement on the title-page : `` Opus Francice scripsit
Leo Cahun	PERSON	, in Anglicum vertit
Helena E. Frewer	PERSON	, Latine interpretatus est Arcadius Avellanus . ' '

		Is the present ver - sion based on the English translation ?

		If so , why ?

		Surely there is no apparent reason for so circuitous a proceeding .

Reginald Belgium	PERSON	by

Belgium	LOCATION	matter stranger than any novelist would dare venture to de - pict .

		`` In a Moment of Time '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- is a plea for a people outraged , dispossessed , and slaughtered by the wickedest war waged in historic time .

		The author dedicates the profits from his book to funds for the amelioration -LRB- so far as irremediable wrongs can be bet - tered -RRB- of the situation he found there .

		This situation is described in such details as will bear printing , with suggestions of horror sur - passing the power of the pen looming ghastly in the background .

		Mr.
Kauffman	PERSON	sums up his plea in a few vivid words : '' Charity has no nationality and knows none .

		It is not a prod - uct of justice ; it is justice .

		To stand with folded hands and watch another nation starve : that is not neutrality ; it is the last refinement of enmity .

		The duty of
America	LOCATION	, we have been told , is to be neutral ; then the duty of
America	LOCATION	is charity . ''

		Incidentally , by every dictate of civilization , the conquerors should be feeding the people they have disinherited .

		In making its contribution to these victims ,
America	LOCATION	finds itself paying tribute to ruthlessness .

		It has to be done and it must be done , but it is not to be expected that
America	LOCATION	should forego its intelligence and not set the blame where it has been so devilishly earned .

		There are repro - duced photographs to support the text , but it needs no support .

		As we read we know that the fact is worse than the tale itself , and we bow our heads in shame at man 's inhumanity to man .

Stanley Coxon	PERSON	, author of an anecdotal autobiography entitled `` And That Reminds Me '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , which shows us the writer encircling the globe eight times in sailing ships , continuing his mari - time activities under the swifter propulsion of steam , entering the government service as assistant district superintendent of police in
Burma	LOCATION	, where he helped to make a success of Prince
Albert Victor	PERSON	's visit to that part of the British Empire , then returning home on sick furlough , next appointed to various posi - tions in
India	LOCATION	, and finally invalided from the service and left with sufficient leisure on his hands to write -LRB- with no thought of publica - tion , he assures us -RRB- the present story of his eventful life .

		Between times he has found it possible to engage in divers sorts of perilous undertakings and adventures , including matri - mony , and it is his partner in the last-named desperate deed who has persuaded him to make full confession of his dubious doings we borrow his own playful style without as - suming responsibility for any false inferences therefrom in order that she at least may have some adequate knowledge of his `` awful past . ''

		Our thanks therefore are due pri - marily to Mrs.
Coxon	PERSON	, and secondarily to the author , for what , in the frankly colloquial idiom of the book , may truthfully be called a rattling good story .

		At the close , he turns to the political organization and to the problems which confronted the still young experiment of a democratic-republican federal state .

		The book is well illustrated , and is blessed with an index and a bibliography , in the latter of which , however , the proof-reading has left something to be desired .

		Throughout the body of the work the personal element is large , and is accompanied with frequent reve - lations of the quiet humor of the author .

The Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	' ` It is the equal of the best English quarterlies and continues to grow better with each issue , and the greatest literary enjoyment any man could desire would be that the Review be a monthly instead of a quarterly . ''

		Other readers , though perhaps none more gracefully , have requested more frequent publica - tion of

		The

		Far more important is the marvel - ous delineation of Guimo and almost equally val - uable is the panorama of the islands which unfolds before the reader under the magic of the story .

		Guimo is one of the most haunting characters of recent fiction , and only Kipling has made the Orient live more vividly than this author has done .

		Chicago Journal .

		Guimo is one of those books that , like the four - leafed clover , fills the finder with glee or secret joy .

		Both for infinite variety and quality of pris - tine purity this romance will live long in the minds of literary fiction lovers .

		393 THE PRESENT GENERATION .

		Every man of middle age must have looked back to the days of his youth and speculated a little on how different things were then ; there comes a time in the life of everyone when he realizes that he is no longer young and that the present generation is somehow different from the generation of his youth .

		Just what this difference is , is rarely obvious .

		It is no more obvious to-day than at other times .

		For myself , I am of necessity given to rather academic studies , and I often join such thoughts to speculations concerning the turn of the century that rise from a study of En - glish Literature .

		There we have , as has often been noted , the great age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, a period of freedom , and the great age of
Anne	PERSON	, a period of discipline .

		The mind naturally runs on to the romantic period , about
1800	DATE	, where again it was the time of liberty and imagina - tion and ideas ; and then says , How about
1900	DATE	?

		`` Was that to be a second period of dis - cipline , of correctness , of restraint ?

		Has it been , is it such ?

		Certainly we can hardly expect the regular recurrence of expansion and contraction , of systole and diastole , as my honored old teacher Professor
Corson	PERSON	used to like to say .

		Even if it were a regular heart beating , or a pendulum swinging , we should hardly expect that ; for though it might have come regularly in
1600	DATE	,
1700	DATE	,
1800	DATE	, there has been such disturbance of conditions that we could hardly expect just the same ebb and flow , or flow and ebb , coming to its point in
1900	DATE	.

		Not to mention the great Victorian age , which perhaps was no greater interruption to the regularity of ideas than the Puritan revolution in the seventeenth century or the romantic revival in the eighteenth , there were other new conditions especially affecting letters .

		The utilitarian turn of the Victorian age was certainly making for an age of restraint , and indeed had made it , only sooner than one might have expected .

		No time has been so dead to anything that the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans or the romanticists would recognize as the time about
1880	DATE	.

		The period of repression had come sooner , that was all , induced prob - ably by the immense increase of the read - 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	ing and writing public that came about from the mechanical advances in printing and the other arts that go to the making of books .

		I should say that the older generation the generation which came to maturity about
' 75	DATE	,
' 80	DATE	, or '85 showed not restraint but repres - sion to a considerable degree .

		It did nothing in poetry ; to write ballades , villanelles , ron - deaus , rondels , triolets was its highest achieve - ment .

		It did something in prose ; but it was the prose of observation and document , the prose of
Defoe	PERSON	two hundred years before , but generally without his genius .

		It was pretty hopeless in religion -LRB- here in
America	LOCATION	, at least -RRB- , and pretty hopeless in politics .

		Much may be learned from the attitude of the young .

		Thou - sands of men now getting on in middle life were then in college ; they can say whether what was then called '' Harvard indifference '' was confined to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		We need not fancy that
1900	DATE	was to have been another
1700	DATE	.

		It very clearly was not .

		Whoever looked in
1900	DATE	for a modern Pope , a modern
Addison	PERSON	, a modern
Defoe	PERSON	, a modern
Locke	PERSON	, would have been sadly disappointed .

		Rudyard Kipling and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
Henri Bergson	PERSON	and
William James	PERSON	,
John Sargent	PERSON	and
Claude Monet	PERSON	,
Anatole France	LOCATION	and
Mau	PERSON	- rice
Maeterlinck	PERSON	did not point in that direc - tion .

		It may not be clear just whither they * did point ; but it was not toward Law , as com - monly understood .

		Science and
Logic	ORGANIZATION	and Realism had come to their zenith some years before .

		If we look back to those days thirty or forty years ago we who can remember them we shall feel instinctively that times were very different .

		And the difference will not be the usual difference between youth and middle age .

		It is not that we were then fresh , enthusi - astic , free , and that now we are confined , toned down , limited .

		That is the way one would expect an older man to look back to the days of his youth .

		But I will wager that with any man who has kept up with the times , the feel - ing is just the reverse , he will feel that in those days he was confined and had no chance to live or think , and that it is in these days that one is more free to do something .

		Take a few of the movements of the time that especially concern young men and young women .

		We might at the very first say that it is something that such things should now con - cern young women as well as young men ; but take that for granted .

		It was in
1888	DATE	that the Student Volunteer Movement was begun ; that is a type , only , of a movement for active relig - ion a hundred-fold greater .

		It was the indi - rect outcome , of course , of earlier influences , such as the preaching of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	; but the full fruition of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's work was slow .

		The
Northfield Conference	ORGANIZATION	, the Student
Volun	PERSON	- teers , the Christian Endeavorers , and many other forms of awakened Christianity , came in the last generation .

		In politics the change is equally marked .

		The recollections of any political worker of middle age , the life of any politician , should show that much .

		As I look back to my college days , I feel sure that the temptation to the young man to get out into political work was very slight .

		I often used to think of it : it * seemed as if the great causes had all been set - tled ; civil service reform and the mugwump movement were almost the only things .

		Doubt - less there was far more than I saw in those - days , but I believe the main idea is correct .

		So also with social service .


Charles Brace	PERSON	's ; '' The Dangerous Classes of
New York	LOCATION	'' and
Charles Booth	PERSON	's '' Labor and Life in
East London	LOCATION	'' were early and important books , and
General Booth 's Christian Mission	ORGANIZATION	as well as the Five-Points Mission in
New York	LOCATION	pointed a way .

		But the new era only began with
Toynbee Hall	ORGANIZATION	in
1885	DATE	and
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	in
1889	DATE	.

		Social service to-day is a wholly different thing ; from the philanthropy of
1880	DATE	.

		This deals chiefly with
America	LOCATION	alone .

		I have not the broad outlook that could include the world ; but certainly the words Modernism ; in religion , Socialism in politics , Social Ser - vice in philanthropy , seem to show much the same thing .

		In one case we can be more exact .

		In
France	LOCATION	a few years ago they were much impressed with just this interest of which I now speak , and a number of inquiries were made as to the difference in the thought of the young men of
France	LOCATION	in our own day and the young men of a generation ago .

		Of these in - quiries the one published under the name of `` Agathon '' was most widely known , and in spite of some adverse criticism its general tenor may probably be accepted as accurate .

		Agathon looks back to the eighties , and views the generation for which
Paul Bourget	PERSON	wrote his '' Psychologic Contemporaine . ''

		There are perhaps among those who read these lines some who remember those brilliant essays when they came out , those remarkable studies of the mas - ters of modern
France	LOCATION	,
Taine	PERSON	,
Renan	LOCATION	, Bau -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 367 delaire .

		Agathon sees the generation of young
France	LOCATION	which came to manhood in the years following the war of
' 70	DATE	- '71 to have been materialistic , sceptical , dilettante .

		Very dif - ferent the
France	LOCATION	of to-day , as Agathon por - trayed it and as the war found it , very different in religion , in politics , and in the life of service .

		We can not be far wrong if we believe that the new century found the human spirit straining to get forward rather than holding back , looking out and not in , bent on action rather than doubting as to truth .

		So much probably would be news to few .

		Farther it might be hard to go .

		Was
1900	DATE	merely looking to a repetition of
1800	DATE	or
1600	DATE	, a repetition coming faster than might have been anticipated because ideas get about faster than they used and so men live faster than they used ?

		Can we take the torch of Shake - speare and
Bacon	PERSON	and
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, and carry it farther ?

		Can we indeed -LRB- to drop the figure -RRB- even read Shakespeare and
Wordsworth	PERSON	to-day and feel that they have anything to say to the modern man ?

		Certain men of modern minds would doubtless say no .

		I would not discuss that .

		I would gladly , however , point out one new idea in the pres - ent course of events which may prove to be a general leaven to the life of our time .

		I have spoken of religion , politics , and social service ; now there is a word to be said of literature .

		The literature of the last generation has offered a curious commingling of the effort to see the environment of the life about us just as it is -LRB- which is sometimes called realism -RRB- and the effort to realize some other kind of life which we instinctively feel is better , which is sometimes called romance and sometimes ideal - ism and sometimes other things .

		Everyone will recognize this in the fiction of the last thirty years and in the drama .

		It may be seen also in poetry .

		Toward the end of the eighties appeared the work of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	and of Yeats ; in the nineties were
Davidson	PERSON	and
Phillips	LOCATION	; in the first years of our century came
John Mase	PERSON	- field and
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	.

		The first thing one would say about
Henley	PERSON	,
Davidson	PERSON	,
Masefield	PERSON	-LRB- or at least the first thing that people did say -RRB- is , Here is realism .

		And of
Yeats	PERSON	,
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Noyes	PERSON	, we should say , Here is romance .

		Yet as soon as we begin to read either set we find that such a ticketing is not of much use .

		Each one may have his especial leading , but
Henley	LOCATION	, in spite of his '' Hospital Sketches '' and ''
London	LOCATION	Voluntaries , '' is certainly romantic enough ; and
Yeats	PERSON	, in spite of his wanderings with
Oisin	PERSON	and
Niamh	PERSON	, in spite of his old Celtic romance or his modern magic , keeps pretty well in touch with the plain every-day life of the modern Irish peasant .

		And so with the others ; there are preferences but there is not that sharp distinction between life as we know it and life as we wish it might be .

		There is a passage in
Scott	LOCATION	's '' Waverley '' that is very typical of its time , almost exactly a century ago .

		Toward the end of the book it is written of
Waverley	LOCATION	, left behind on the re - treat from
Derby	LOCATION	, that '' he felt himself enti - tled to say firmly , though perhaps with a sigh , that the romance of his life was ended , and that its real history had commenced . ''

		But nobody believes in any such sharp con - trast now .

		The whole idea of modern religion , modern politics , modern social service is that one must go into them with such conviction , such enthusiasm , such life that their crudest realities fuse into a true romance .

		In fact , neo-realism and neo-romance are the same thing ; which is the reason why it is so hard to classify -LRB- in the old classification -RRB- people like
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Of these two typical men I will merely offer two sayings which -LRB- to my mind -RRB- provide an explanation of the modern movement .

		Of
Kip	PERSON	- ling we have an evidence , not from his own writing but from that of another , as to what he was to the rising generation . ''

		He pro- vided phrases for just that desire for discipline and devotion . ''

		There is more in '' The New Machiavelli , '' but that expresses what I see in
Kipling	LOCATION	, discipline become devotion , or just the other way if you will .

		That gets the two things together somehow , liberty and law ; it fuses them .

		Of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	I will merely quote a chance expression , but a true one for all that . ''

		Virtue , '' says he , '' consists not in abstaining from vice , but in not desiring it . ''

		I do n't know where he says it ; but I would trust Dr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	, from whom I quote it , on more than that .

		I have written so much already that I can - not now develop this idea into all its ramifica - tions in the life of our time .

		Perhaps some other time I may be allowed space to do that .

		For the moment it must be enough to say that the whole strength of the religious movements of the past generation lies in its emphasis on the power of Christ to-day to bring the human 368 -LSB-
May 13	DATE	will into harmony with himself and the pur - poses of God ; that the essence of modern poli - tics is that no system and no legislation im - posed from without can ever make our public life what it should be , but that reform must be renaissance and come from within , must begin with the individual citizen ; and that the heart of the social movement lies not in a sort of Lady Bountiful helping the poor , but in so much fellow-feeling with those who need help that one realizes that the needs and wants of one are needs and wants of all .

		The aim is -LRB- as it has always been -RRB- sincerity : the only way to make men good is to make them long to be good .

		An old idea ,
John Wesley	PERSON	,
Francis	PERSON	,
Paul	PERSON	knew it .

		If it be not the idea of to-day I wish it was .

		If at last the treasures of literature now supposed to be lurking in sun - dry crypts and lofts and mosque libraries of
Constantinople	LOCATION	shall be brought to light , what may they not include ?

		Even some of the best - known names in Greek poetry and drama are at present represented by but a small portion of the writings believed to have come from their respective authors ' pens , ^ Eschylus , known to us through seven cherished tragedies , is said to have written ten times that number ; Sophocles likewise survives in seven of his tragedies , while one hundred and thirty are ascribed to him ; and though the less-esteemed Euripides has come down to us in a score -LRB- less two -RRB- of his dramatic pieces , he exhibited plays for thirty-three years after first winning the grand prize in 441 B. c. , and must have left behind him when he died in 406 , at the age of seventy-five , a great many more than the eighteen extant tragedies bearing his name .

		Of other famous Greeks , known to the modern world by few of their works or by none at all , and thought to be awaiting a possible resurrec - tion when the day of doom shall dawn on the Turkish capital , there are , for example ,
Archi	ORGANIZATION	- lochus of Paros , Hipponax of
Ephesus	LOCATION	, Ana - creon and
Sappho	PERSON	and Alcaeus ,
Stersichorus	PERSON	,
Simonides	PERSON	of
Amorgos	ORGANIZATION	, and that later
Simon	PERSON	- ides , of Ceos , famous for his prize elegy on those who fell at
Marathon	LOCATION	, and for fifty-five other prize compositions ; and
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, whose extant work is but a fragment , and
Philetas of Cos	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lycophron	PERSON	, and Callimachus , and Meleager , and who knows how many more .

		If all these should come into their own with the fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	, what a renaissance of Greek literature would forever after be assor ciated with this the four hundred and sixty - second year after the taking of that city by the Ottomans !

		And if the recapture of the place from them should chance to fall on the twenty-ninth of this month for it was on
May 29 , 1453	DATE	, that they took possession of the capital of the
Eastern Empire	ORGANIZATION	what a mem - orable anniversary celebration that would be !

		THE SHORT-STORY HARVEST OF
1914	DATE	, so far as that harvest is garnered within the covers of eight leading American periodicals , has been winnowed and sifted by Mr.
Edward J. O'Brien	PERSON	, who publishes the results of his self - imposed labor in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' in a form resembling that in which Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	has for some years been wont to present his findings in respect to the annual crop of magazine verse .

		Six hundred and one short stories were read by Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	, who pronounces 229 of them to be possessed of `` distinction , '' and 86 marked by `` very high distinction . ''

		Among those writers who have produced the best work in this depart - ment , according to Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	, are especially to be noted Mrs.
Katharine Fullerton Gerould	PERSON	, Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, Mr.
Melville Davisson	PERSON	Post , Mr.
H. G. Dwight	PERSON	, Mr.

Calvin Johnston	PERSON	, Mr.
Armis	PERSON	- tead
C. Gordon	PERSON	, Miss
Mary Synon	PERSON	, Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, and Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	; and in his opinion the five best short stories of the year were , in the order of their merit , `` Brothers of No Kin , '' by Mr.
Richter	PERSON	-LRB- in `` The Forum '' -RRB- , ``
Addie Erb	PERSON	and Her Girl Lottie , '' by Mr.

Mary Synon	PERSON	, and '' The Tri - umph of Night , '' by Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	-LRB- the three last-named in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' -RRB- .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's deductions and judgments are of undoubted interest ; yet it is nevertheless probable that if ninety-nine other persons of equal critical capability were to present ap - praisals , based upon the same data , of the best short stories of the year , no two lists among the hundred would be found to correspond .

		THE NEW HEAD OF THE JOHN
CARTER BROWN	PERSON	LIBRARY , in succession to Mr.
George Parker Winship	PERSON	, who goes to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	as librarian of the
Harry Elkins Widener	PERSON	collection , is an - nounced to be Mr.
Champlin Burrage	PERSON	, of the same stock as the
Boston Burrages	LOCATION	, though his present position as librarian of
Manchester College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, may beget the erroneous in - ference that he is an Englishman .


Portland	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, is his birthplace ,
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	his alma mater , and he is still on what may be called the upward slope of life , having been graduated from college as late as
1896	DATE	.

		Two years of German university study , chiefly at
Berlin	LOCATION	, followed his graduation , and he has made a specialty of church history , particu - larly the history of the non-conformist move - ment in
England	LOCATION	, unearthing some important documents about
Kobert Browne	PERSON	, founder of the Brownist sect , which later became known j as that of the Independents or
Congregation	ORGANIZATION	- alists .

		Also new sources of knowledge relating to
John Robinson	PERSON	, pastor of the Pilgrims in
Holland	LOCATION	, have been laid open by Mr.
Burrage	PERSON	, who has published '' The New Covenant Idea , '' '' New Facts concerning Rev.
John Robinson	PERSON	, '' and '' The Early English Dissenters in the
Light of Recent Research	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		He has taken the degree of bachelor of letters at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, which has stood sponsor for his more important his - torical publications and has , through Profes - sor
Firth	PERSON	and others , expressed its sense of his ability in research .

		A collector , for himself and others , and a bibliophile , as well as a stu - dent and writer , he comes to his new duties at
Providence	LOCATION	with ample equipment and every promise of success in continuing the useful - ness and the high repute of the famous his - torical library to which he is called .

		AN ADJUSTMENT OP COPYRIGHT DIFFERENCES between this country and
England	LOCATION	, as indeed between all the civilized nations of the earth , is one of the things to be hoped for and striven for in that better future to which mankind is ever looking eagerly forward .

		A recent step in the right direction has been taken by the British government in the issuance of an '' order in council '' not of a warlike com - plexion , but eminently pacificatory decree - ing that henceforth the unpublished literary , dramatic , musical , or artistic work of an Amer - ican author , playwright , composer , or artist shall enjoy the protection of British copyright equally with all such work of British origin .

		Thus the public performance of an American play in
England	LOCATION	will make its copyright there secure , without the publication heretofore re - quired for copyright purposes .

		Musical com - positions and art works will profit in like manner .

		All this should remind us , to our shame , that
England	LOCATION	has always been more liberal toward American authors in respect to copyright privileges than
America	LOCATION	has been toward English authors .

		Our absurd laws still require an .

		English author seeking Amer - ican copyright , to print his book in this coun - try from type set up or plates made in the
United States	LOCATION	, whereas
England	LOCATION	only asks for simultaneous publication in the two countries , with no silly specifications in regard to print - ing .

		In the realm of letters all things that savor of international jealousy or suspicion or unfriendliness are absurdly and lamentably out of place .

		ONE DAY 'S ACTIVITIES IN A BUSY REFERENCE ROOM are too numerous and varied , and under too little supervision or control , to admit of anything like accurate record .

		Who can tell how many hundred different topics may be the subject of more or less thorough research at any one time , through the thousand or more general works of reference freely accessible to all comers in such public libraries as those of
New York	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
St. Louis	LOCATION	' ?

		Within the working hours of one such literary laboratory , that at
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, the following subjects are '' a few that came to the attention of the staff , '' as we learn from Mr.
Calvin W. Foss	PERSON	, the reference librarian in charge of the department : `` Assaying of dia - monds ; lubricating oils ; Platt Amendment to Act concerning Relations of
United States	LOCATION	with
Cuba	LOCATION	; criticisms of the writings of Seu - mas MacManus ; Norman influence on English literature ; Franco-Spanish Treaty -LRB-
1912	DATE	-RRB- concerning

Ceuta	LOCATION	,
Morocco	LOCATION	;
Tissot	PERSON	paintings of Life of Christ ;
New York	LOCATION	laws respecting Morgues ; foot and mouth disease ; follicular mange ; color pho - tography ; laws governing charitable institu - tions of
New York City	LOCATION	; finger-ring design ; Japanese embroidery ; steam engineering ; comparative value of clay lands in different states , and market prices of the clays ; archi - tecture and furnishings of colonial dining rooms . ''

		When it is borne in mind that on the following day as many more entirely different topics probably demanded investigation , and on the day after that still another list , and so on for year after year , though with considera - 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	ble duplication of research , in the long - run , the practical usefulness of this part of a library 's equipment becomes apparent .

		We need this reminder occasionally , in view of the unde - niable expense of this equipment .

		A POTENT POEM , the potency of which has shown itself in causing the withdrawal of Professor
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	's candidacy for the ex - change professorship at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	next season , has enjoyed an unexpectedly wide publicity after its recent initial appearance in '' The Harvard Advocate . ''

		Awarded by Dean
Briggs	PERSON	and Professor
Bliss Perry	PERSON	the prize offered by this student publication for the best poem on the European war , this piece of verse , from the pen of Mr.
C. Huntington Jacobs	PERSON	, of the junior class , takes its place beside
Hoffmann	PERSON	von Fallersleben 's '' Deutschland , Deutschland iiber Alles '' as a generator of strife .

		It is entitled ``
Gott	PERSON	mit Uns , '' and is doubtless familiar to most readers by this time .

		That Euterpe or Polyhymnia or any other of the Muses should thus become involved with Mars in a quarrel so abhorrent , as one would sup - pose , to the Pierian Nine , must excite regret .

		The present incident , which has elicited an impassioned protest from our distinguished visitor , may perhaps serve a useful end in illus - trating how trivial a matter will evoke the most vehement demonstrations of wrath when the atmosphere is tense with such bitter ani - mosities as those of the present time .

		`` We are living in a powder magazine , and must be careful with our matches .

		SECOND-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS is very decidedly abundant , as compared with direct acquaintance .

		The hardest work in the world is to think independently ; therefore mankind in general is glad to be told what it ought to think about the great masters of literature , and what book-titles and other scraps of lit - erary information it ought to have at its tongue 's end .

		Addison and
Johnson	PERSON	, Mon - taigne and Yoltaire ,
Schiller	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Homer and
Dante	PERSON	and even Shakespeare , are little more than names to many persons who have the reputation of being - well-read and perhaps actually think themselves to be so .

		This vague half - knowledge , or one-tenth - knowledge , however , is rarely made the object of deliberate commendation on the part of anyone whose opinion is of value .

		Yet some such praise seems to be bestowed by '' The Bul - letin of the
Brooklyn Institute of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Sciences '' when in a recent well-deserved trib - ute to Professor
Copeland	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	it says : `` Many Harvard men owe their knowledge of eighteenth-century English , of Fielding and
Smollett	PERSON	, of
Goldsmith	PERSON	and Pope , directly to Mr.
Copeland	PERSON	rather than to their readings in history or literature of that age . ''

		Might it not have been more complimentary to Professor
Copeland	PERSON	, and also nearer the truth , to say that many
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men owe their knowledge of the authors named to their readings in those authors , prompted by their teacher , even more than to his personal instruction ?

		Contact with a born educator does not convert the pupil into a sponge ; he is rather fired with zeal for more positive intellectual activity than is implied in mere absorption .

		The assimila - tion of knowledge , like the assimilation of food , calls for a considerable amount of reac - tive energy .

		A DEFINITION OF GREAT LITERATURE , from Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's pen , has gained considerable cur - rency of late , and its pithy brevity makes it worth committing to memory .

		It was after commending the unstudied effectiveness of Grant 's style in his '' Personal Memoirs '' that he enunciated , in explanation of the book 's recognized claim to greatness , the truth that '' great literature is nothing more nor less than the clear expression of minds that have some - thing great in them , whether religion , or beauty , or deep experience . ''

		This helps to explain why , as
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	was wont to affirm , the best biography is that which ap - proaches the nearest to autobiography ; and it was with some such truth in mind that
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	used to declare the only thing a man was really competent to write about was himself .

		Hence , too , as has been more than once pointed out , the truly great novel is , in essentials , autobiographical , though it is by no means necessary that it should be written in the first person , and it does not at all follow that every work of fiction presented as auto - biography is possessed of greatness .

		Those novelists who hope to impart an otherwise un - attainable virtue to their productions by mak - ing them autobiographic in form , but not in substance , may deceive themselves , though they will never deceive a discerning reader .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		A SPURIOUS DERIVATION ATTRIBUTED TO LA SALLE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A story was set afloat some years ago concerning the derivation of the name of
Chicago	LOCATION	, which in the first instance was intended without doubt as a humorous sally by its originator .

		But as in at least two instances , it has deceived recent writers , who seem to have regarded it as authentic , it would appear to be necessary to examine the matter seriously .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 371 In Edwin 0 .

		Gale 's '' Reminiscences of
Early Chicago	LOCATION	, '' published in
1902	DATE	, there was printed what purported to be a letter by the explorer La Salle , said to have been written in
1682	DATE	from the j present site of
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' to a friend in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		In this letter -LRB- as printed -RRB- La Salle describes the river , flowing into the lake with a feeble current , '' which occupies the course that formerly the waters of these great lakes took as they flowed southward to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	river . ''

		La Salle is made to say in this letter that '' the boundless regions of the West must send their products to the
East	LOCATION	through this point .

		This will be the gate of empire , this the seat of commerce , '' a truly remarkable prediction if he ever wrote it as alleged . ''

		If I were to give this place a name , '' he continues , tl I would derive it from the nature of the place and the nature of the man who will occupy this place ago , I act ; circum , all around ; Circago . ''

		Gale comments as follows on this extraordinary deri - vation : '' The recollections of this statement , imparted to an Indian chief , remained but indis - tinctly , and when the Americans who built
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	came to these wilds they heard what they thought to be the legendary name of the place and pronounced it as did the Indians , Che-ca-go , instead of Circago as La Salle had named it . ''

		Gale was an inveterate joker , as anyone will read - ily perceive who reads his book ; but his recollec - tions have a real value to the historical student notwithstanding the author 's humorous proclivities , for he came at a very early time , having arrived with his parents at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1835	DATE	.

		Now this so-called letter of La Salle 's was given a place in
Gale	PERSON	's book apparently for a humorous purpose and nothing else .

		It is a surprising fact , however , that the letter has been taken quite seriously by later writers .

		In a volume entitled ''
Chicago	LOCATION	, Past and Present , '' by
S. R. Winehell	PERSON	, published in
1906	DATE	-LRB- four years after the appearance of
Gale	PERSON	's book -RRB- , there is quoted the La Salle letter together with
Gale	PERSON	's comments , as if with the author 's approval of its authenticity .

		Likewise in the '' City Manual of
1914	DATE	, '' issued by the
Chicago Bureau of Statis	ORGANIZATION	- tics , the letter is quoted on the reverse of the title - page , occupying the page by itself , apparently with the approval of the compiler .

		It is interesting to observe , however , that at least one writer was not deceived by the letter thus appearing for the first time in Gale 's book .

		Mr.
John F. Steward	PERSON	, in his work entitled '' Lost
Mara	PERSON	- mech and
Earliest Chicago	LOCATION	, '' published in
1903	DATE	, notices the publication of the letter , and remarks : '' I do not find anything like this in any of the writings of La Salle , and I believe that I have a copy of every scratch of La Salle 's pen that did not perish with him . ''

		Other writers , however , have regarded the letter as a joke , which it undoubt - edly is and was intended to be , and have made no references to it whatever .

		One would have supposed that the general con - tents and style of the letter would have furnished sufficient evidence of its spurious character .

		The description of the region , for example , where the '' course that formerly the waters of these great lakes took as they flowed southward to the Missis - sippi river / ' is mentioned , could only have been based on knowledge that neither La Salle nor any of his contemporaries possessed , for such knowl - edge has been arrived at only by means of investi - gations into glacial action by scientific men within the last two generations .

		In regard to the sounding phrase that '' this will be the gate of empire , this the seat of commerce , '' it is impossible to believe that La Salle ever used the language quoted , as it is foreign to his !

		own style and that of other writers of the time .

		Ingenious derivations of place names have been a favorite sort of humor in times past , !

		mostly con - fined to newspaper paragraphs ; and persons hav - ing a taste for fantastic notions of the kind , often said by their inventors to be derived from tales of trappers or Indians , find immense enjoyment in their repetition .

		But this is probably the first instance where it has become necessary to enter a solemn refutation of nonsense of this character .

		However , if jokes must be labelled , let it be done in this case ; or , better still , let such trifling be excluded from text-books and manuals having a serious pur - pose in view .

		THE FALLACIES OF '' PEACE INSUEANCE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Permit me to call your attention to some errors in your review of my book , '' Peace Insurance , '' in your issue of
April 15	DATE	.

		You state that my volume '' offers no explanation as to why
Europe	LOCATION	, which has long carried very heavy insurance of this sort -LSB- armament -RSB- , has now so destructive a war upon its hands . ''

		While it is true that I did not attempt to cover the intricate and controversial causes of the war , I did explain the causes in general in some detail .

		Permit me to invite your attention to pages 4 and 5 , and to quote therefrom , in part : '' It is thus that military force , insuring against defeat in war , insures against any war at all ... We insure against loss by fire , theft , burglary , etc. .

		... In addition we attempt to prevent loss by fire departments , police departments , etc. .

		These forces , it is needless to say , do not prevent fires , nor crimes , but they lessen their frequency and afford the BEST MEANS OF PROTECTION YET KNOWN .

		Mili - tary force bears the same relation to conflicts between nations . ''

		The above is but a summary .

		In the book it is substantiated at some length .

		Your statement that I offer no explanation is , therefore , incorrect .

		It is also stated in your review that the fact '' that the victorious Confederate army at Bull Run also consisted of volunteers seems to have escaped the writer 's notice , '' this being a result of my claim that with an army of trained troops , instead of a mob of civilians , the North would have gained a decisive victory and probably ended the war .

		I hope that you do not always reason so lightly .

		It may be remarked that when armies meet in bat - tle , even with both sides untrained , it is not infre - quent for one side or the other to be victorious .

		However , when a trained army meets an untrained army of equal size , it is seldom that the untrained one wins .

		It was this fact which did come to my notice , and which caused me to say that a trained army on the side of the North would have changed 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	the result and ended the war .

		Had the South a trained army I could not have made such a state - ment .

		Furthermore , on page 153 of my book you will find actual comment on the condition of the Confederate force .

		Hence your statement in this respect is also incorrect .

		Your closing sentences state that the anti-mili - tarist sees things as they ought to be and can be , while the militarist sees things as they were in the past alone .

		However , in '' Peace Insurance , '' while a very proper advantage is taken of the lessons of the past , two complete chapters are taken up with a study of the present and the future , namely , the chapters on '' The
Likeli	PERSON	- hood of War To-day '' and `` Will War Ever Be Abolished ? ''

		The fact is that my book does con - sider things as they are , and as they probably will be according to all natural laws ; while the pacifists confuse these facts with theory and things as they ought to be , but in our time can not be .

		Of course , in my attempt to present the case for the so-called military party , I have failed to do it justice in many respects .

		In that respect the book is weak , and it contains the errors common to all such publications .

		Nevertheless , I have been grati - fied to note that in their adverse criticism , the pacifists , among whom your reviewer must be num - bered , are apparently compelled to evade the mat - ters considered , to misstate matters , or to select trivial errors which reflect only on the author and in no way on the correctness of his thesis .

		Your attention is invited especially to pages 157 and 158 of my book .

		It is to be hoped that you will be fair enough to correct your misstatements .

		-LSB- While we are glad to give space to the above , we do not consider that it impugns the validity of our reviewer 's statements at any point .

		The quoted paragraph can scarcely be regarded as a satisfactory explanation of the break-down of the author 's theory in the case of the present war .

		Nor is the analogy with insurance against fire , theft , etc. , an accurate one .

		The function of our police departments is to detect and suppress crime ; the function of our fire departments is to extinguish con - flagrations .

		The function of an armed mili - tary force is to fight , and throughout the history of the world those countries with the largest armed forces have always been the aggressors in warfare .

		In the case of the Civil War , the author imagines that the pos - session of '' an army of trained troops '' by the North would have resulted in a victory at Bull Run and thus ended the war .

		But why did the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	victory not end the war ?

		And with an army of trained troops at her com - mand , would the South have been any the less reluctant to secede from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and thus provoke war ?

		Our reviewer does not say that '' the militarist sees things as they were in the past alone . ''

		He says that `` the militarist finds his warrant in what has been '' rather than in what ought to be .

		The difference between militarist and anti-militarist is simi - lar to the difference between the bourbon slaveholder of ante bellum days and the aboli - tionist .

		To the former , slavery was an estab - lished institution , based on '' natural laws , '' which had always existed and so always must exist : to the latter it was a menace to civiliza - tion that must be wiped out at any cost .

		EDITOR . -RSB-

		AN ANCIENT JOURNALISTIC JEST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It has long been the fashion of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	press to make the word
Chicago	LOCATION	synonymous with pork , wheat , and wind , and to refuse to admit the possi - bility of culture .

		I have sometimes wondered how far this convention is due to the
Chicago	LOCATION	daily newspapers themselves .

		Recently a serious association of writers , the
Society of Midland Authors	ORGANIZATION	, completed its organi - zation in this city .

		Its founders were Messrs.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	,
H. C. Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	,
William Allen White	PERSON	,
Emerson Hough	PERSON	, and others equally prominent , and its roll contains the names of nearly all the well-known writers in the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		The morning after the meeting one of our leading dailies gave the new society a column with the heading , `` Thrill Spillers Feast and Play : Stuff Selling Well . ''

		The article began with the ancient jest reclothed in the following form : ''
Chicago	LOCATION	, the city of wheat corners and meat trusts , witnessed another naughty combine when twenty-six authors wiggled their fingers at the Sherman anti-trust law and corraled all of the divine afflatus , '' etc. .

		Probably an article written in just this vein could not have appeared in a reputable newspaper of any other American city large enough to form the head - quarters of such an organization .

		It is not an isolated case , but has been repeated in one form or another in the news columns of nearly all of the
Chicago	LOCATION	dailies when the subject of authorship is approached .

		I do not refer to the review columns ; they are for the most part admirably managed , and are , on the whole , the equal of any in the country .

		It is not to be supposed that the authors them - selves take these good-natured slaps with great seriousness .

		They may smile rather wearily at the antiquity of the jest , and let it pass .

		But the news - papers that assume this attitude toward literature are giving color to the laugh that has always been raised in the
East	LOCATION	against
Chicago	LOCATION	culture .

		If the
Chicago	LOCATION	dailies are to be regarded as the makers of public opinion , they should take different ground than this ; if they are to be considered as the reflex of public opinion , they should have some regard for the increasingly large number of citizens who wish to see
Chicago	LOCATION	freed from its ancient stigma .

		There are some who hope that the time is coming when the men and women who write books will not be regarded by our city press as a subject only for merriment ,

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 373 A VETERAN DRAMATIC CRITIC ox FAMOUS SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS .

		* To praise in formal terms at this late date a work of Shakespearean scholarship and crit - ical taste and judgment concerning which our pre-eminent
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	editor and scholar , the late Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, wrote -LRB- in commending its initial volume -RRB- , `` Never before has there been , within the same compass , so much truth and wisdom uttered concerning the acting and interpretation of Shakespeare , '' would savor strongly of superfluity if not of absurdity .

		Some indication of the contents and main features of the second series of Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare on the Stage '' will sufficiently introduce the book to those inter - ested in this rich garnering of more than half a century 's criticism and reflection in the field of Shakespearean stage presentation in En - gland and
America	LOCATION	.

		As in the opening volume , so in this , six plays are considered ; namely , '' Twelfth Night , '' `` Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' `` As You Like It , '' `` King Lear , '' `` The Taming of the Shrew , '' and ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		A brief history of the play , including some account of its early presentation , is first given , in each instance , and is followed by descriptions of subsequent memorable performances , these descriptions becoming more and more vivid and entertain - ing as the times are reached wherein the writer was old enough to have personal knowl - edge of that whereof he writes .

		Appraisements and comparisons of leading Sha.kespeare im - personators fill much of the space , and the numerous portraits of these actors and ac - tresses in stage costume heighten the effect of the author 's descriptions .

		Cold must be the temperament of him who refuses to kindle with some reminiscent ardor over these recol - lections of the Shakespearean triumphs of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	and
John McCullough	PERSON	and
Henry Irving	PERSON	, of
Adelaide Neilson	LOCATION	and
Mary Anderson	PERSON	and
Ada Rehan	LOCATION	, with many others , some of whom will have entered into the play - going experience of the great majority of those who turn Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's pages .

		His warm but always intelligent appreciation of good acting shows itself repeatedly , as for instance in his glowing accounts of that masterpiece of histrionic art ,
Adelaide Neilson	LOCATION	's impersona - tion of Juliet .

		Here as elsewhere he lays emphasis on the importance of a well-con - ceived artistic purpose , of a certain detach - ment that forbids the player to lose himself in * SHAKESPEARE ON THE STAGE .

		his part , however passionate may be the emo - tions he is called upon to portray .

		In Miss
Neilson	PERSON	's acting , he says , '' the mind , invaria - bly and rightly , controlled the feelings . ''

		And further , with a grace of diction and a critical penetration that will not be lost upon the appreciative reader , he continues : ''
Miss Neilson	PERSON	's
Juliet	PERSON	was a being all truth , innocence , ardor , and loveliness , in whose aspect , nevertheless , there was something ominously sug - gestive of predestination to misery , herself mean - while being pathetically unconscious of her doom .

		It was not so much what the actress said and did as what she was that permeated her performance of Juliet with this strange , touching quality , which saddened even while it enthralled ; it was the per - sonality of the woman , not only captivating the senses but powerfully affecting the imagination .

		All that she said and did , however , had been care - fully considered .

		Nothing had been left to chance .

		She knew what she intended to do , and she knew how to do it for which reason the personation was distinct , rounded , cumulative in effect , and free equally from tameness and extravagance .

		She had , as all actors of genius have , moments of sud - den insight and electrical impulse , in which fine things are unpremeditatedly done , but she was , intrinsically , an artist , and over all that she said and did and seemed to be there was a dominance of artistic purpose which , without sacrifice of the glamour of poetry , made the poetic ideal an actual , natural human being . ''

		There is more that one is tempted to quote , exquisite in delicate appreciation and vivid in apt selection of epithet and phrase ; but the reader 's full enjoyment of the book itself must not be unduly forestalled .

		Instead , and as an amusing illustration of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's other manner , of his command of sarcasm and his ability to voice in no uncertain tones his un - flattering opinion of an inferior and preten - tious performance , let us insert a few of his remarks on a quite different interpretation of the same favorite Shakespeare character : '' ... The tragedy was produced , for the pur - pose of ' starring ' Miss Mather , by Mr.
James M. Hill	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, since deceased , a genial specula - tor in popular ' amusements / who believed , with Bottom , that Tragedy should not be permitted to fright the ladies . '

		A lion among ladies , ' says the immortal weaver , ` is a most dreadful thing . '

		In Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's production , accordingly , the play , arranged in six acts , sixteen scenes , and nine tableaux , was considerately invested with the accessories of decorum and soothing domesticity .

		In the scene of the secret marriage of Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	two monks , moved , apparently , by springs , suddenly came out of the wall of
Friar Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	's Cell and placed hassocks for the bride and groom to kneel on , while the service was in progress .

		Juliet 's Bed-room , the time of her nuptials being the middle of
July	DATE	, in a hot country , was thought - fully provided with a large fire of brightly blazing logs .

		On the morning appointed for her wedding 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	a numerous company of young women entered her chamber , to awaken her with cheerful song , but , finding her dead , those accommodating vocalists placidly ranged themselves about the apartment and sang an appropriate and moving dirge .

		Juliet 's
Tomb	ORGANIZATION	, a huge , gilded structure , shaped like a glove - box interiorly illuminated , was exteriorly flooded with ' moonlight , ' shed from a glaring ' lime . '

		And at the last , as a decent , orderly , becoming close to the spectacle of affliction , many friars thronged into the graveyard and sang the ' Miserere , ' seeming to imply that
Borneo	LOCATION	, when on his way to the Tomb , had heedfully paused at the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	and bespoken ecclesiastical participation in the forth - coming obsequies .

		To enhance the effect of these imposing novelties Mr.
Hill	PERSON	furnished highly - colored scenery that shone like a brass coal-scuttle .

		As I viewed the spectacle I thought of an old play in which the comedian
Burton	PERSON	was exceedingly droll , acting an ignorant parvenu , who , being asked whether , in the furnishing of his library , he wanted to have f all the old authors , ' exclaims , ' No , not a damn ' one of 'em !

		All new ! ' ''

		In his chapter on ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' the longest and perhaps the most noteworthy in the book , the author makes clear , incidentally , what his doctrine as elsewhere stated might seem to contradict , that art is not all-powerful on the stage , that even a great actor 's intelligent con - ception of his part may be neutralized more or less by peculiarities or defects of tempera - ment .

		Concerning
Edwin Forrest	PERSON	's acting of Lear , which the author witnessed many times , he has considerable to say , of which a part is here given . ''

		Forrest was never indefinite .

		In all his acting clarity of design was conspicuous , and strength of person went hand in hand with strength of pur - pose .

		He knew his intention and he possessed absolute control of the means needful for its ful - filment .

		He was never weakened by self - distrust .

		He never wavered .

		Adamantine authority , inflexi - ble repose , explicit intent , directness of execution , and physical magnetism were his principal imple - ments , and he used them freely and finely .

		His figure was commanding , his voice copious and reso - nant .

		He was a man of prodigious individuality , an egotist of the most positive type .

		The beauties of his acting were much upon the surface ; the defects of it were largely those of his character .

		In the vigorous maturity of his professional life his King Lear was little more than an exhibition of himself ; an exceedingly strong and resolute man , assuming , not very convincingly , the appear - ance of being old , and imitating , cleverly but not pathetically , the condition of madness .

		In his later years he had become much changed .

		Thought , study , observation , experience , and the silent dis - cipline of time , had , in a measure , chastened his egotistical spirit and refined his art .

		Misfortune , sickness , and suffering had done their work on him , as they do on others .

		The last time I saw him as King Lear he played the part as it should be played , and was like the breaking and then broken old man that King Lear is . ''

		The natural tendency of a dramatic critic of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's age and experience to favor the old methods and distrust the new , appears by implication here and there , and explicitly in more or less positive utterances scattered through the book , notably in certain passages of his preface like the following : '' No account has been attempted of the methods employed by such eccentric pretenders to origi - nality as
Herr Max Reinhardt	PERSON	, Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	, and Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		Judgment as to their productions necessarily waits until they have been seen and studied .

		Their methods , if I can trust what I have read and heard about them , are , variously , degenerate , contemptible , and silly , in fact , an abomination . ''

		Mr.
Ben Greet	PERSON	's attempt to give us Shake - speare somewhat in the Elizabethan manner fails to win the author 's applause .

		In his opening chapter he takes occasion to say : '' Mr.
Greet	PERSON	is aware , and he has so signified in print , that the old mode of producing Shake - speare 's plays ' can only be reflected to a limited extent / in which case the reflection is , practi - cally , barren of ' educational ' value .

		This mana - ger 's actual purpose , as distinguished from his pretended one , is commercial , and as such a purpose is honest it should not be associated with a sophis - tical and fatuous pretence , which smacks of hum - bug .

		To produce plays as , probably or certainly , they were produced three hundred years ago , before Science had made discoveries and Ingenuity had contrived inventions which Taste has employed to revolutionize all the old processes of industry and art , is only to do badly that which can be done well ; and to do this under the pretence of serving the cause of ' education ' is to be disingenuous . ''

		But may not half a loaf be better than no bread ?

		Even a partial return from the dis - tracting elaboration of the modern Shake - spearean performance to something like the austere simplicity of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own time may have real value , even `` educational '' value , in spite of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's serious doubts .

		Four more volumes , the author announces , remain to be written in this series , so that it is not yet the time to point out any conspicuous omissions , any over-emphasis upon the old - time stars at the expense of their modern suc - cessors in the Shakespearean firmament .

		An occasional foreglimpse of what is to be ex - pected in those volumes is given in the present one , and the sustained interest of the completed work may be taken for granted .

		Announce - ment of half a dozen other prospective works , largely devoted to actors and acting , promises still further delights to Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's readers .

		May they reach completion and fall nothing short of this volume in engaging quality , refining influence , and intellectual stimulus !

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 375 A CRITIC 'S CREDO .

		* For all who have read Mr.
`` W. C. Brownell	PERSON	's few severely and serenely weighed volumes of criticism , and have come to know him as one of
America	LOCATION	's leading critics , an arbiter who may well challenge comparison with his best contemporaries in
England	LOCATION	, it is a pleasure to turn to the recent slender volume in which he formulates his critical credo .

		One finds noth - ing disappointing in these pages , with their characteristic tough-sinewed style , perhaps a little more gnarled than usual but bright with carefully distilled epigrams , cunning with logic , full of learned words sometimes almost queerly
Johnsonian	DATE	, but striding quite natu - rally in buskins . ''

		Criticism itself is much criticized , '' says Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	, `` which logi - cally establishes its title . ''

		He answers those who say that '' only artists should write about art '' by observing that the artist has , in gen - eral , a point of view which is either merely `` personal and not professional '' or conven - tional ; in either case it is not likely to receive well the innovations or reactions of another artist .

		In considering the field and function `` of criticism , Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	first classifies `` all artistic accomplishment '' into the '' moral and material . ''

		The critic needs a less elaborate knowledge of the material -LRB- technique -RRB- than the practitioner .

		Indeed , such knowledge in excess would tempt the critic `` to exploit it rather than subordinate it , '' and thus lose the perfect poise upon which Arnold insisted .

		Hence the impatience of the artist , who often seeks in criticism `` what it is the province of the studio to provide . ''

		Thus also it comes about that '' artistic innovation meets nowhere with such illiberal hostility as it encounters in its own hierarchy , and less on temperamental than on technical grounds . ''

		`` The proper judge of the tiller , '' moreover , '' is not the car - penter but the helmsman . ''

		The material data are far less significant for the critic than the moral .

		No artist can achieve greatly without the moral attributes .

		But the artist-critic generally neglects these to gossip about mere craftsmanship , while the true critic signalizes these life-giving qualities . ''

		The true objects of his contemplation are the multifarious ele - ments of truth , beauty , goodness , and their approximations and antipodes , underlying the various phenomena which express them , rather than the laws and rules peculiar to each form of phenomenal expression ; which , beyond acquiring the familiarity needful for adequate appreciation , he may leave to the professional didacticism of each . ''

		* CRITICISM .

		By
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	.

		Scribner 's Sons .


New York	LOCATION	: Charles Let the critic remember that '' no one knows his subject who knows his subject alone '' and provide himself with a rich equipment .

		Since literature is a criticism of life , he must know life intimately , and he must have a philosophy of life in order that his '' individuality '' may '' achieve outline . ''

		To Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	, history seems to take first rank among the general departments of knowledge necessary for the critic 's broader equipment .

		^ Esthetics , too , are very valuable , though their field is deemed more restricted than that of history .

		Let the literary critic know art , and the critic of art know letters .

		Cultivate divine philosophy , but sparingly ; `` its peculiar peril is pedantry . ''

		As examples of critics who have profited by this `` cognate calling , '' Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	names Sainte-Beuve ,
Taine	PERSON	, and
Scherer	PERSON	, and dis - cusses them -LRB- as indeed he comes later to discuss others -RRB- with deep penetration . ''

		I know nothing of art , '' says the Philistine , '' but I know what I like . ''

		For retort , let us recall Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	's words : '' So do the beasts of the field . ''

		Criticism must have a criterion .

		Impressionism may `` be strictly defined as appetite '' : and though in its great practi - tioners it `` has certainly nothing gross about it , '' it is limited by its habit of giving deci - sions without reasons and so can not validate `` its decisions for the acceptance of others . ''

		Impressionism rises , to be sure , from a fine sense of tolerance .

		But since there is no uni - versal taste , a critic `` to be convincing must appeal to some accepted standard .

		And the aim of criticism is conviction . ''

		Yet one must beware of reacting against impressionism in the manner of Brunetiere .

		His destructive work was good .

		But constructively he could place against mere personal preference a cri - terion no better than `` the classic canon '' of the art of the seventeenth century , an art
august	DATE	, but forever departed . ''

		Though he became a distinguished scholar , Brunetiere retained the temperament of schoolmaster '' -LRB- a defect which may the reviewer interject it ?

		is equally fatal to a critic and a school - master -RRB- .

		Let the true arbiter be humbler , and learn from impressionism at least this that even Euclidian proof demands postulates , that critical dogmas `` rest finally upon in - stinct , '' and that `` faith underlies reason . ''

		Moreover , the postulates of criticism are , un - like those of mathematics , '' taken for granted rather than self-evident . ''

		and are often mere specious conventions `` that depend on the sanction of universal agreement . ''

		Hence come the imperious but transitory conventions of romanticism , realism , symbolism , and so forth , setting fashions importunately only to stand out at last as but vaguely and imper - 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	f ectly related to eternal principles .

		The really eternal postulates have varied little since the days of Aristotle .

		Let us then call upon the impressionist , who advances a new intuition , '' to tell us why '' since intuition does not go far without reason .

		We should ask : `` Is your feeling the result of direct intuitive percep - tion , or of unconscious subscription to conven - tion '' which the reason may winnow away as quasi-intuition , chaff , prejudice ?

		Impression - ism unsupported by intuition may well im - peach the reason , but let it remember that the reason is not to be dethroned .

		The critic must judge , not merely '' testify and record . ''

		With the bright instrument of the reason he is no longer the old-fashioned judge , '' the slave of schools , '' or the irresponsible impressionist , `` the sponsor of whim . ''

		Reason alone can deal fairly with our great contemporary prob - lem of '' realism , '' and show when '' realism '' becomes unreal , or where the opponent of realism confuses '' the ideal with the fantas - tic . ''

		Finally , the rational criterion will serve better than all others to determine '' the rela - tion of art and letters to the life that is their substance and their subject as well . ''

		And a rational criterion implies a construc - tive method .

		In itself , analysis reaches no conclusion , which is the end and aim of rea - son .

		Here Sainte-Beuve often fell short .

		We must , as critics , have a thesis quite as much as do those works of art which we criticize .

		Yet the constructive method tempts readily to ex - cess , a central conception often leads to the `` partisanship of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, the inelasticity of
Taine	PERSON	, the prescriptive formulary of
Brune	PERSON	- tiere .

		The spirit of system stifles freedom of perception and distorts detail . ''

		As we ap - proach such criticism , either as readers or as practitioners , we must guard against untrust - worthiness , yet keep our minds open to the values of its artistry , its insight , its genuine instructiveness .

		The now popular historical method reveals most markedly the excess of the constructive method .

		Taine , for instance , was not a critic but a philosophical historian .

		But if he blurs individual traits he certainly illumines general perspectives .

		The rest may be left to pure criticism ; for though the his - torical method has rendered great constructive services , it tends to impose theory on the lit - erature and aesthetic facts rather than to reveal their essential character .

		Taine spent too much time on causes , too little on characteris - tics ; he was content w r ith explanation , and unfortunately chose not to pass on to estima - tion .

		The true critic remembers that '' theory means preconception , '' preconception which , `` based as it perforce is upon some former crystallization of the diverse and undulating elements of artistic expression , is logically inapplicable at any given time except as it draws its authority from examples of perma - nent value and enduring appeal , in which case no one would think of calling it preconcep - tion at all . ''

		This does not mean that criticism must become
ancillar3 %	PERCENT	concerned merely with collecting data for the synthesist .

		Sainte -
Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's achievement is larger than
Taine	PERSON	's and ''
Sainte-Beuve	PERSON	's work is itself markedly synthetic '' in its special way , although it dwells on material examples and concrete ideas rather than on systems and theories .

		Such criticism may find unity through a proper consideration of the author under judgment . ''

		For personality is the most concrete and consistent entity imaginable , mysteriously unifying the most varied and complicated attributes . '' ''

		For beyond denial criticism is itself an art ; and , as many of its most successful products have been entitled ' portraits , ' sustains a closer analogy at its best with plastic portraiture than with such pursuits as history and philosophy , which seek sys - tem through science .

		One of Sainte-Beuve 's stud - ies is as definitely a portrait as one of
Holbein	LOCATION	's ; and on the other hand a portrait by
Sargent	PERSON	, for example , is only more obviously and not more really , a critical product than are the famous ' por - traits ' that have interpreted to us the generations of the great . ''

		But the critic , if wise , will `` confine himself to portraiture and eschew the panorama . '' ''

		His direct aim is truth even in dealing with beauty , forgetting which his criticism is menaced with transmutation into the kind of poetry that one ' drops into ' rather than attains ... The end of our effort is a true estimate of the data encountered in the search for that beauty which from Plato to
Keats	PERSON	has been virtually identified with truth , and the highest service of criticism is to secure that the true and the beautiful , and not the ugly and the false , may in wider and wider circles of apprecia - tion be esteemed to be the good . ''

		Many of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's dicta for exam - ple , that '' faith underlies reason '' and that `` theory means preconception , '' tempt his reader to believe that when he speaks of '' reason , '' to which he rightly attaches such a vast importance , he has the deductive method in mind most of the time .

		As far as the de - ductive method goes , we may well agree that the position of faith is to underlie reason , to underlie it in the guise of a premise .

		But when we turn to the inductive method , may we not come nearer to precision by saying that since the inductive method never abso - lutely exhausts its data , the conclusion -LRB- now mingling perforce with some of our rigidly suppressed , nay completely forgotten , intui - tions -RRB- is a kind of faith that comes as a climax superimposed upon the honest and
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 377 austere practice of rational investigation ?

		Similarly , to the inductive reasoner , theory need not mean a preconceptioii that will para - lyze or even influence one 's alertness for new facts and truths .

		An inductive critic may well begin with a childlike acceptance of the generalizations of his predecessor , examine the collected data , discover new instances -LRB- as a new age always permits him -RRB- , and come at the end to his own theory , a theory which is almost sure to modify if not reject the conclu - sions of the earlier critic .

		I do not mean to say that Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	neglects the inductive method .

		But he appears to turn with the greater readiness to syllogisms .

		In seeking for the One amidst the welter of the Many , in his quest for eternal principles , he becomes rather diffident , and would force too severe limitations on criticism .

		You must not be wanton , he realizes , in urging premises on your readers .

		For this reason he distrusts the old critic , '' the slave of schools '' ; and so he well may .

		Yet Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	should turn again to the judgment of .

		Dame Nature at the close of the great debate for supremacy between Jove and
Mutabilitie	PERSON	, the awful arbiter of the One and the terrible and beautiful titaness who swayed the Many : '' I well consider all that ye have saycl , And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate And changed be : yet being rightly wayd , They are not changed from their first estate ; But by their change their being doe dilate : And turning to themselves at length againe , Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate : Then over them Change doth not rule and raigne , But they raigne over Change , and doe their states maintaine . ''

		The critic of to-day may well expect to find intimations of the One in even the pedantic theories of a Bossu on epic .

		He should not , with
Coleridge	PERSON	, turn too impatiently from these .

		He will find amidst the chaff of Bossu intimations of the One , here and there an eternal principle , an eternal being in thought which has been not destroyed but dilated by the commingling , for all the strife and quali - fyings , of many restless and diverse opinions of later decades .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	is non-com - mittal about the rules .

		He appears ultimately to fall back upon the study and estimate of an individual as the only intimation of the One with which the critic can with absolute safety hope to deal .

		He warns the critic , for in - stance , against working with panorama .

		But this is just where
Taine	PERSON	succeeded .

		Of indi - viduals he made warped portraits .

		But his Rubens-like panoramic criticism has a large element of soundness , as well as of visual splendor , that has placed his '' History of English Literature , '' for all its preconcep - tions , among the greatest and most enduring memories of his century .

		Finally , I can not accept Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's sharp antithesis between the beautiful and the ugly , and his assertion that art is con - cerned only with the beautiful .

		Such gen - eralizations , all too common , close the mind to many masterpieces , in all the arts , from men as far apart in time and place and nation as Rembrandt and
Browning	PERSON	and -LRB- may I risk the name in such orthodox company ? -RRB-


Arnold Schoenberg	PERSON	in some of the most impressive parts of the second of his `` Drei Klavier -
Stuecke	PERSON	, '' Opus 11 .

		I should think , rather , of the ugly and the lovely as antipodes , with the pretty as a debased version of the lovely and the grotesque as a whimsical variation , altogether admirable , of the ugly .

		I should add that the ugly contains often strength or firmness , massiveness or even sublimity , some quality or other lacking in the lovely .

		There - fore the ugly often appeals to us , partly be - cause we see therein qualities which when wedded with the lovely make that beauty which seldom appears in life or art , and even then is as evanescent as some fleeting expres - sion on the face of a beloved woman that is remembered long after death or evil chance has stolen away her whole image , remem - bered as a benignant siren to lure us on that endless quest in which lies the supreme stimu - lus of profound and enduring joy-in-life .

ELLSWORTH CORY	PERSON	.

		A DEFENCE OF SOCIALISM .

		* In '' Socialism as the Sociological Ideal '' we are presented with one more of those visions of a purified society which have in the past served so useful a purpose in stimulating the imagina - tion , and in keeping us alive to the vast imper - fections of the economic structure of the world .

		It is at all times good to feel in touch with a genuinely altruistic spirit , based upon a divine discontent with things as they are , and the more so when it takes the form of what Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	calls '' the white passion of state - craft . ''

		From the lowering atmosphere of the well-fed man to whom this is the best of all possible worlds , or the hardly less depressing company of the philanthropist whose highest ideal of society seems to be that of a com - munity where one half of the people are con - stantly engaged in the endless task of holding the other half out of the gutter , it is a relief to turn to one who feels the fundamental wrong - ness in the present constitution of society and has some arguable remedy to offer .

		And when , * SOCIALISM AS THE SOCIOLOGICAL , IDEAL .

		A
Broader Basis for Socialism	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Floyd J. Melvin	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	as in the book before us , the philosophy of Socialism is expounded in a spirit of sweet reasonableness , and without a trace of that bitterness which mars so much of such writing , one is the more disposed to lend an attentive ear and to weigh carefully the arguments ad - duced .

		It might hastily be concluded that all that can be said in defence of Socialism has long ago been said ; but against this contention it must be remembered that recent develop - ments in the conduct of industry , taking place as they do at a constantly accelerating pace , make much that has formerly been written inapplicable and out-of-date ; and that conse - quently a re-statement of the case for a social - istic reorganization of industry , in full view of present-day phases in the relationship be - tween labor and capital , should be acceptable .

		It should also be said of this book , as can not be affirmed of all such apologies for Socialism , that it is pervaded through and through by the higher idealism .

		It is the liberation of the human spirit from the fell clutch of cir - cumstance that the writer obviously aspires to .

		Socialism is advocated because of the recogni - tion that the higher life is conditioned on a sound physical and economic basis .

		In the author 's own words , '' Socialism is as wide as man 's aspirations .

		Its aims must be those of our common humanity . ''

		With this preliminary testimony , given in all sincerity , to the readableness and useful - ness of the book as a provocative of thought , it remains to be said that it will be found un - convincing by the man whose mind is still open , and in our opinion will seem conclusive only to those whose judgments are already formed in the same direction .

		In the first place , Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	makes the mis - take which characterizes the writings of most apostles of Socialism , the mistake of assum - ing , what still requires proof , that Socialism is necessary before economic justice can pre - vail in society .

		The assumption is implicit , from beginning to end of the book , that in the original structure of human relationships there is an inherent wayward tendency for things to go awry , and that it is normal or natural in an unregulated condition of human intercourse , or mutual exchange of services , for wealth to distribute itself with no regard to fairness and equity .

		Now this is just the point as to which many earnest and intelli - gent thinkers are still in doubt .

		There still stubbornly lingers the subconscious suspicion that if we understood properly the basic natu - ral laws which constitute the science of politi - cal economy , and conformed our actions to those laws , we should find that human affairs `` have not this perverse tendency to go wrong , and that justice and not injustice is the natu - ral outcome of free or unregulated effort , when undeflected by monopoly or special privilege .

		Thtsre persist the aspiration for more light , and that faith in the constitution of the uni - verse , which find expression in the words of
Milton	LOCATION	, '' What in me is dark , illumine ; that to the height of this great argument I may assert Eternal
Providence	LOCATION	and justify the ways of God to man . ''

		It is surely , then , an apposite question to ask and answer , whether the eternal order of things is such that it should be necessary for man to suspend the operation of natural law , and set up instead a system of artificial law which shall work out results more in conformity with his moral sense than natural law will yield .

		When a physician is diagnosing the case of a patient whose blood circulation is weak , whose heart and lungs are functioning irregularly , and all of whose organs are working more or less in - harmoniously with each other , he does not assume this disharmony to be normal but ab - normal , and seeks to trace the disorder to one disturbing cause , believing as he must that in the absence of such a cause there would have been no occasion for his interference .

		It is , we believe , because of the omission to make this preliminary inquiry that Dr.
Mel	PERSON	- vin has fallen upon certain assumptions that seem to weaken or invalidate the superstruc - ture of conclusions to which he invites us .

		The antithesis , for example , between society con - ceived of as an organism and as an organiza - tion , is somewhat arbitrary and artificial .

		Is it true , we may ask , that in an organism '' all significant individuality is denied to the con - stituent parts '' ?

		Notwithstanding that the authority of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	may be quoted in support of this postulate , and which indeed Spencer advances only as a modifying con - sideration to his elaborate argument that so - ciety is an organism , we submit that in the light of recent psycho-physiological researches the postulate may be questioned , and it may well be doubted whether we are yet on the threshold of a true understanding of the na - ture of the organic cell .

		It is always unsafe to argue from ignorance ; and it may be , as seems now probable , that we can not deny to the individual cell an incipient consciousness analogous to the imperfect civic consciousness which is all that can be found in most of the members of a community .

		On the other hand , in what the process of organization can differ from the natural organic process , by which certain cells are specialized and set apart to do the thinking and directing , is not apparent .

		The opposition then , between the ideas of organism and organization , on which Dr.
Mel	PERSON	-
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 379 vin appears to lay considerable weight , seems to lead nowhere in particular and to be of little value as an illuminative concept .

		Out of this distrust of natural processes , Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	has obviously fallen into the as - sumption that the confessedly artificial system of human relationships which Socialism would set up may be identified with democracy .

		Democracy is one of those concepts the full content of which will probably reveal itself to the human mind only after much experience and many strenuous efforts in the art of liv - ing ; and it may be doubted whether we are yet within sight of its true significance .

		None of the modern catch-words of liberalism ex - haust its deepest and most fundamental mean - ings .

		Mere majority-rule can surely never be mistaken for the last word in democracy ?

		That fifty-one per cent should compel the other forty-nine into a certain way of living , may be expedient at a certain stage in the evolution of society , and be preferable to chaos , as the more reasonable of the minority may admit ; but it is not democracy .

		Neither is '' govern - ment of the people by the people and for the people '' a full expression of democracy , so long as it takes no account of the man who wants - neither to govern nor to be governed but simply to be let alone to earn his own living and live his own life , subject only to the con - dition that he does not infringe upon the sim - ilar liberty of others .

		A socialist organization , therefore , that is not voluntary to the last and most insignificant unit composing the group is not a democracy , whatever argument of expediency may be adduced in its favor .

		To the same distrust of nature 's methods , growing out of a very laudable revulsion from the Darwinian struggle-for-existence theory of life , we attribute Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	's terror of compe - tition , and his identification of it as the mod - ern equivalent of exterminative warfare .

		In general it may be said that the mind with a pre-disposition towards Socialism has a rooted inability to imagine the current of competi - tion running in an opposite direction from that which it now takes .

		At present we see laborers competing against each other for the permission of the capitalists that they may earn their livings ; and we note the physical , moral , and aesthetic deterioration of character which results .

		But what if we conceive of a condition of things where capitalists should be competing with each other for the privilege of employing labor , and were compelled to offer , higher and still higher remuneration , and bet - ter and still better conditions as to hours and protection from danger , as the only means of obtaining workers ?

		That it should be difficult .

		to imagine such a relationship between labor and capital is only another instance of the tyranny of custom and tradition on our modes of thought .

		In the subconscious backgrounds of most open minds there persists the belief that in some discoverable condition of human freedom , such as we have never yet realized , this latter kind of competition would be the natural one .

		It is this unformulated belief that makes humane people defend labor-saving machinery , notwithstanding its very disastrous effects under present conditions in displacing workers and causing destitution .

		For we know instinctively that the invention of ma - chinery ought to save labor in a true sense , and not in the cruel sense to which we are accus - tomed .

		And it is because we trust our in - stincts , and distrust our arguments , that we hesitate to prefer what Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	calls `` the superstructure of man 's purposive creation '' to `` the basic unpurposive natural order which seems to ignore the harmonies de - manded by man . ''

		-LRB- The italics are ours . -RRB-

		As to the problem of distribution again , Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	thinks that the ultimate educa - tional ideal '' can be set down as nothing less than to each according to his needs . ''

		But where shall we find the superman who is wise enough and good enough to determine the needs of each member of a community ?

		`` Needs '' vary indefinitely in proportion to faculty .

		Nature , indeed , seems wisely to have decreed an exact relation between needs and the capacity for contributing to the communal stock of commodities and services .

		The man of small capacity for adding to the social wealth has few needs and desires , while the man of large capacity requires large supplies of leisure , books , scientific instruments , eas chairs , opportunities for travel , companion - ship , and many other aids to the full develop - ment of his faculties .

		Is one not justified in suspecting that under the free conditions we have tried to imagine -LRB- to the absence of which are probably due all the evils against which Socialism is directed -RRB- the apportionment `` to each according to his needs '' would take place with automatic and unerring accuracy ?

		If it does not savor of hyper-criticism we might remark that Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	seems on page 17 to cut away the plank on which he rests his argument for the socialization of industry .

		In opposing political individualism he says : `` All prohibitive government is an enormity if it is less or more than a mere representation of the natural limitations arising from the mutually con - flicting desires of its subjects .

		The socialist is affirming no new or undiscovered principle in op - posing political individualism .

		Thus the socialist society as conceived by its advocates seeks to embody only those restrictions on the freedom of the individual that are naturally inevitable . ''

		380 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	Does this not seem to point to just what Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	repudiates , namely , the restriction of governmental function to that of preventing aggression of one citizen on another , or what Huxley described as `` administrative nihilism '' and some profane Spencerian critic called '' a glorified police-office for the keeping of the peace '' ?

		We conclude this imperfect review of a stimulating and suggestive book with the as - surance that those who wish to know the best that can be said for a philosophy that has captured the sympathy and enthusiasm of thousands , will find here what they require .

		Two CANADIAN STATESMEN .

		*
Just half a century	DATE	ago there met in the city of
Quebec	LOCATION	a group of statesmen representing the principal colonies of British North Amer - ica .

		They had come together to bring about the union of these colonies .

		After long de - liberation they finally agreed upon the terms , and drafted a constitution which was ratified by each of the colonial legislatures , and finally , on
July 1 , 1867	DATE	, passed by the imperial parlia - ment as the British North America Act .

		The men who thus created out of a group of weak and scattered colonies a powerful and ambi - tious commonwealth have since been known to Canadians as the '' Fathers of Confederation . ''

		They are represented to-day by a single sur - vivor , the veteran statesman , Sir
Charles Tupper	PERSON	, who in his ninety-third year has pub - lished a substantial volume of reminiscences , throwing a most interesting and valuable light upon the history of the confederation move - ment and the subsequent development of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
Charles Tupper	PERSON	first entered public life in
1855	DATE	, in
Cumberland County	LOCATION	,
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, having the assurance not only to run against the Liberal leader ,
Joseph Howe	PERSON	, but to defeat him .

		He became a member of the
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	government the following year , remaining until
1860	DATE	.

		From
1864	DATE	to
1867	DATE	he was premier of the province .

		The latter year he was elected a member of the first Dominion parliament , but , although he had been largely instru - mental in bringing about confederation , he unselfishly stepped aside when
John A. Mac	PERSON	- donald was forming his first cabinet , to make room for his old opponent ,
Joseph Howe	PERSON	.

		One finds in the `` Recollections of Sixty Years '' the confidential correspondence between Mac - donald and
Tupper	PERSON	as a result of which

		movement , was finally induced to enter the first Dominion cabinet .

		In
1870	DATE	Tupper joined the
Macdonald	PERSON	ministry as president of the council , and in this and succeeding administrations he filled the important offices of Minister of Inland Revenue , Minister of Customs , Minister of Public Works ,
Minister of Railways and Canals	ORGANIZATION	, and
Minister of Finance	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
1884	DATE	to
1887	DATE	, and again be - tween
1888	DATE	and
1896	DATE	, he acted as High Com - missioner for
Canada	LOCATION	in
England	LOCATION	, and for his services to the country he was created a bar - onet .

		In
1896	DATE	, when the Conservative admin - istration had fallen upon evil days , they sent for the old `` War Horse of Cumberland , '' as he was called , to lead them in the approach - ing general election .

		In spite of his seventy - five years , the prospect of one more political battle was irresistible .

		He immediately re - signed his high commissionership , came back to
Canada	LOCATION	as prime minister , and led his party gallantly in what he knew must be a losing fight .

		For several years he led the opposition in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and finally in
1906	DATE	, at the age of 85 , retired from active political life .

		For over half a century Sir
Charles Tupper	PERSON	served his country faithfully .

		He has seen
Canada	LOCATION	grow from weakness to strength ; with the possible exception of Sir
John Macdonald	PERSON	, no other man has done more as a constructive statesman to make the Do - minion what it is to-day .

		Apart from the chapters of Sir
Charles	PERSON	's book which deal more particularly with po - litical events and movements , probably the most interesting portion is that which tells the story of his visit to the Red River Settlement in
1870	DATE	and his interview with the leader of the
Half-Breed Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	,
Louis Riel	PERSON	.

		Donald
A. Smith	PERSON	-LRB- afterward Lord
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	had told him that it would be as much as his life was worth to go to
Fort Garry	LOCATION	at that time , particularly as
Riel	PERSON	and his followers knew the active part
Tupper	PERSON	had taken in bringing about confed - eration , to which they assigned all their troubles .

		`` I told him , '' says
Tupper	PERSON	, `` that I had promised Sir
John A. Macdonald	PERSON	to get into
Fort Garry	LOCATION	, and that I intended to do so . ' '

		And he did .

		Riel had seized the horses , wagons , and baggage of Captain
Cameron	PERSON	,
Tupper	PERSON	's son-in-law , who had been sent to
Fort Garry	LOCATION	in an official capacity , and
Tupper	PERSON	, as soon as he reached the fort , made his way to the council chamber of the rebel chiefs and , after telling
Riel	PERSON	who he was , demanded the restoration of
Cameron	ORGANIZATION	's belongings .

		Riel was apparently so taken by surprise that he not only permitted
Tupper	PERSON	to return in safety , but actually restored the spoils of war .

		The
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 real object of the seemingly foolhardy visit was to get some idea of the situation at
Fort Garry	LOCATION	, and if possible to persuade the rebels that they were mad to defy the Dominion government , and could remedy their griev - ances by peaceful negotiation .

		Tupper realized at once that he could do nothing with
Kiel	ORGANIZATION	, but talked the matter over with
Pere Richot	PERSON	, one of his principal advisers .

		He found that the rebels were convinced that they could carry on a successful guerrilla warfare in the vast wilderness of the west , and that in the last resort they could annex the western country to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He therefore had to leave them to their fate .

		Packed with interesting and valuable ma - terial to the student of Canadian history , the book is distinctly disappointing as a piece of composition .

		The material was evidently put by Sir
Charles Tupper	PERSON	into the hands of some one who either through incompetence or through indolence failed to realize his oppor - tunity .

		As a result , what might have been an autobiography of the first importance is not much more than a scrap-book .

		Sir
George Foster	PERSON	's `` Canadian Addresses '' brings together for the first time a selection of the principal speeches and public addresses in recent years of the
Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, one of the ablest and most incisive speakers of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such topics are included as `` Reciprocity with the
United States	LOCATION	, '' `` The Imperial Conferences / ' `` The Naval Policy , '' `` Problems of Empire , '' `` The Call of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` Claims of the Nation on the Individual . ''

		In an introduc - tory chapter , Sir
George Foster	PERSON	gives us a rapid sketch of the
Canada	LOCATION	of to-day , from the point of view of one who is taking a lead - ing part in the moulding of her destiny .

		Coming from such a source , the following is of more than passing interest : ''
Canada	LOCATION	has to face three problems its own internal development , its attitude toward outside peoples in respect to settlement within its boun - daries , and its relations to the Empire at large .

		As to the first , its policy has grown gradually , taken on year by year a firmer consistency , and may at the present time be considered as pretty definitely settled .

		It has gained , and will undoubt - edly maintain , complete autonomy of government and administration .

		It is now and must continue to be practically supreme within its territorial boundaries .

		Government follows the line of a sane and reasonable democracy , tempered with the re - straints and checks of its monarchial traditions .

		This latter does not greatly obtrude in forms , but it permeates with its influences and preserves from excess by its conservative tendencies .

		Manhood suffrage practically prevails , and woman suffrage is gradually emerging through the lesser gates of the municipal to the crowning power of national exercise .

		The protective principle , never since Confederation entirely absent from fiscal legisla - tion , became dominant in
1879	DATE	, and has since so continued .

		Joined therewith later was the prin - ciple of preferential treatment of British Empire products , which now includes practically all the imperial possessions except
Newfoundland	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	.

		These will readily be included as soon as they find it possible to reciprocate in like de - gree .

		Protection is not high or oppressive , and is not likely ever to be raised beyond the point neces - sary to place Canadian producers in a position not to exclude , but to compete fairly with the nations more favoured by circumstances , skill and capital . ''


LAWRENCE J. BURPEE	PERSON	.

		THREE BOOKS ON SOUTH
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* During the last few years a marked change has taken place in the character of the numer - ous books annually written on
South America	LOCATION	.

		The single volume which attempts to describe the whole continent , or rather the fringe of coast line ordinarily visited by the hurried tourist , has given place to carefully prepared works dealing with separate countries or even with portions of these countries .

		Moreover , the critical reader is no longer satisfied with superficial generalizations , however cleverly put ; he is justified in demanding that the writer not only evince a thorough knowledge of the region he is describing , but also be able to offer an adequate interpretation of those subtler phases of a nation 's life included in the elusive term civilization .

		Especially is this true at the present time , when one of the unex - pected results of the European war has been a quickened interest in all that relates to
South America	LOCATION	.

		Among recent offerings in this field it is safe to say that none exceeds in interest and permanent value the scholarly monograph by Mr.
Bailey Willis	PERSON	on
Northern Patagonia	LOCATION	.

		At the invitation of Dr.
Ramos-Mexia	PERSON	, the pro- gressive Argentine Minister of Public Works , Mr.
Willis	PERSON	was placed in charge of the
Comi	ORGANIZATION	- sion de Estudios Hidrologicos during the period from
1911	DATE	to
1913	DATE	.

		This commission was entrusted with the important task of mak - ing an exhaustive topographic , geologic , and economic survey of the vast undeveloped and little known region of
Northern Patagonia	LOCATION	, an area approximately as large as the

California	LOCATION	and stretching from the

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	monograph , in which are embodied the results of Mr.
Willis	PERSON	's investigations , falls into two general divisions .

		The first is a detailed de - scription of the pampas of
Northern Patago	LOCATION	- nia .

		This region is generally regarded as a country of desert or steppe-like plains , but it is neither plain nor desert .

		Rather is it a region of semi-arid grassy plateaus , practically all of which is suitable for grazing and much of it adapted to agriculture through the use of dry farming or irrigation .

		It presents cer - tain analogies to the western territory of the
United States	LOCATION	forty years ago .

		Thanks to the energy of the Minister of Public Works , a railroad is being pushed through this region from
Port San Antonio	LOCATION	on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to
Lake Nahuel Huapi	ORGANIZATION	at the base of the
Andes	LOCATION	.

		The districts tributary to this new transconti - nental line districts of enormous potential value are described at length by Dr.
Willis	PERSON	as regards soil , climate , rainfall , resources , and products .

		In the land where President
Mitre	PERSON	's dictum , '' to govern is to populate , '' still holds good the importance of Mr.
Willis	PERSON	's investigation scarcely needs to be stressed .

		Of greater interest to the general reader is the second part of the monograph , containing a detailed account of the wonderful Andean region of
Northern Patagonia	LOCATION	.

		Here is a cor - ner of
South America	LOCATION	replete with surprises for even the most blase and jaded of globe trotters .

		Countless majestic peaks , forest clad and crowned with snow , rise from the dark green waters of fjord-like lakes .

		This Andean lake region , so thoroughly and de - lightfully described by Mr.
Willis	PERSON	, is one of the most remarkable in the world , whether we consider its extent , the solemn grandeur of its mountain scenery , or the number and beauty of its lakes .

		Of these latter there are several score which compare with the lakes of
Switzer	PERSON	- land and
Italy	LOCATION	, and several hundred which would be notable were they situated in the British Isles or in the
United States	LOCATION	, but in this little known section of
South America	LOCATION	they are unnamed and uncounted .

		The most beautiful as well as the most important of these lakes is thus described by Mr.
Willis	PERSON	: ``
Lago Nahuel Huapi	PERSON	, although not one of the largest of the Andean lakes , is as long as
Lake Geneva	LOCATION	, but in form it more nearly resembles the wide-branching
Lake Lucerne	LOCATION	.

		Nowhere are its shores for any distance so low or habitable as the northern shore of
Lac Leman	LOCATION	from
Geneva	LOCATION	to
Montreux	LOCATION	; nor is the expanse of waters so wide as that seen in the view from the hills above
Lau	PERSON	- sanne .

		Only the east end of
Nahuel Huapi	ORGANIZATION	lies wide open to the sun .

		The farther reaches of the lake and its spreading arms sink deep into the Cor - dillera ; branching about islands or beyond prom - ontories , they penetrate among 1 the highest ranges .

		Neither the magnitude nor the beauty of the lake can be grasped in the view from any one point .

		One must explore in launch or sailboat , sail in and out past woods and precipices , follow the dark - green waters around sharp turns into hidden bays , and linger there in the heart of nature 's solitudes .

		The open lake is swept by fierce winds .

		The launch must be strong or the sailboat large and sturdy .

		Yet along the lake shores there are amphitheatres where the waters lie so deep beneath the high moun - tains that the calm of the mirror that reflects the overhanging trees is rarely broken .

		From such retreats the traveler may ascend through the jungles of graceful bamboo in the deep shade of the beech forest to the alpine meadows above tree line , or to the perpetual snows and glaciers of Mount Tronador . ''

		It is gratifying to learn that the government is planning to reserve the most beautiful por - tion of this region as a great national park for the pleasure and welfare of the people .

		But Mr.
Willis	PERSON	is at pains to point out that this fascinating corner of
Argentina	LOCATION	is destined to be more than the playground of the nation .

		The wild mountain torrents descending from the Andean glaciers hold out possibilities of al - most unlimited industrial development .

		Care - ful investigation has convinced the author that the probable available energy which may be derived from these streams exceeds two million horsepower .

		When one considers that
Argen	PERSON	- tina , with all her natural resources , is practi - cally without coal the significance of these figures is apparent .

		Too high praise can not be bestowed on the large number of magnificent plates with which this monograph is illustrated .

		Never before has this Andean region been so adequately and artistically portrayed .

		A supplementary vol - ume of maps , , drawn on a large scale and de - signed to show not only the various physical features but also the resources of
Northern Patagonia	LOCATION	, greatly enhances the usefulness and scientific value of the monograph .

		Mr.
Algot Lange	PERSON	, the well known Brazilian explorer , has added another important work to the growing literature on
Amazonia	LOCATION	. ''

		The Lower Amazon '' is a very readable account of explorations in the more remote regions of the
State of Para	ORGANIZATION	, particularly the district drained by the lower
Tocantins River	LOCATION	.

		In a simple and straightforward way the author describes the daily life of the caboclos , or half-breed rubber - gatherers , and the manner in which the '' black gold '' of the
Amazon Valley	LOCATION	is collected and marketed ; while his training as a student of natural history and botany has enabled him to bring the flora and fauna of the region vividly before the mind of the reader .

		Several chap - ters are devoted to an entertaining account of Mr.
Lange	PERSON	's sojourn among a little-known tribe of Indians living some three hundred miles to the north of Para .

		Of even greater
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 383 interest is the record of his archaeological in - vestigations on the
Island of Marajo	LOCATION	in the delta of the
Amazon	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Laiige	PERSON	was fortu - nate enough to discover an immense quantity of pottery , covered with delicate tracery and of remarkable freshness of color .

		Though he does not hazard any judgment as to the age of this pottery , he is inclined to believe that it is of comparatively recent date .

		Probably the most valuable chapters of the book are those containing the author 's observa - tions on the population and general resources of the country .

		Mr.
Lange	PERSON	attempts , frankly and fairly , to tell the truth about
Amazonia	LOCATION	.

		The picture he draws of the inhabitants of this region is not reassuring .

		Unfavorable climatic conditions , the exorbitant cost of living , un - suitable food , and wretched sanitation have in the opinion of the author seriously impaired the racial stamina of the
North Brazilians	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , the country at large is in a state of lamentable retrogression and universal pov - erty .

		Paradoxical as it may seem , this un - happy condition is due entirely to rubber .

		During a long period of inflated prices the inhabitants of
Amazonia	LOCATION	neglected all other sources of wealth ; and now with the competi - tion of the cheap plantation-grown rubber of the Orient , this good has indirectly turned to evil and left the people with no other means of subsistence .

		And yet , adds Mr.
Lange	PERSON	: '' It will be the happiest , luckiest thing that can happen to
Amazonia	LOCATION	in fact , the only thing that will prevent a complete relapse into total abandon - ment and barbarism , when the Orient captures the rubber market , because then
Amazonia	LOCATION	will be forced to wake up and prevent its people from starving to death ; indeed this awakening is already beginning .


Amazonia	LOCATION	is learning its greatest les - son that is , that it will have to work to cultivate its rich soil now that the mine of ' black gold ' rubber is rapidly disappearing . ''

		Mr.
Lange	PERSON	dilates on the many resources of the country , for the most part still untouched and unexploited .

		Valuable cabinet woods , medicinal plants , tobacco , and a wide variety of fruits are among the products which may in course of time supplant rubber and make
Amazonia	LOCATION	one of the richest countries in the world .

		The book contains a wealth of excel - lent illustrations made from the author 's own photographs .

		It is distinctly one of the best works on the
Amazon Valley	LOCATION	published in re - cent years .

		In ''
Peru	LOCATION	: A Land of Contrasts , ''
Miss Millicent Todd	PERSON	has written a book vivacious in style and delightful in content .


Peru	LOCATION	, we are told , is a paradox .

		Any statement regarding this country `` implies a contrary statement equally valid .

		Contrast is its characteristic quality , true as to the general aspects of the country and ramifying through remote de - tails .

		It is the obvious point of view from which to study
Peru	LOCATION	. ''

		This attitude of the writer is consistently maintained throughout the book .

		The people are set over against the country ; the prosaic present is contrasted with the romantic past ; the dreary desert with the icy highland , and both with the inhospitable jungle .

		Those who are seeking concrete information or a detailed account of the
Peru	LOCATION	of the twen - tieth century may find Miss
Todd	PERSON	's book some - what disappointing ; this despite the fact that it is the result of wide travel and patient in - vestigation .

		It is lacking in explicitness of statement , and is quite innocent of statistics ; moreover , the writer 's fondness for paradoxes and antitheses tends to become a trifle palling .

		Yet for one in quest of the real spirit of
Peru	LOCATION	and her marvellous history the book is an open sesame .

		Miss
Todd	PERSON	has intuitively caught the elusive charm of this land of the Incas and the Conquistadores , and in a series of wonderful word pictures has ' succeeded in communicating much of this charm to the reader .

		As an un - usual book on an unusual country , the volume is to be heartily commended .

		KECENT FICTION .

		* A map which accompanies Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's '' Victory '' is extremely interesting .

		It indi - cates the scenes of the author 's long series of novels and shorter pieces , as well as the routes taken by the ships of his imagination .

		The globe is pretty well circled by these markings , and the geographical range of his inventions is something extraordinary .

		The scene of '' Vic - tory '' is the
Pacific	LOCATION	island of Samburan , a lit - tle to the northwest of
Samoa	LOCATION	, and due east of the scene of the story of `` Almayer 's Folly , '' in which Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's marvellous gift for por - traying the psychology of life in the tropics was first revealed .

		The new book is a char - acteristic Conrad tale , told with somewhat less of indirection than usual , and peopled with figures drawn from the flotsam and jetsam of humanity as found in the remote regions of the earth .

		A Swede named
Heyst	ORGANIZATION	is the cen - tral figure , living upon an island which has been the scene of the operations of a collapsed coal company .

May 13	DATE	man ruffian named
Schomberg	PERSON	, and there he is attracted by a girl violinist in the orchestra that provides entertainment for the disreputa - ble frequenters of the resort .

		She is evidently unhappy , and
Heyst	PERSON	soon learns that she is driven to desperation by
Schomberg	PERSON	's odious advances , whereupon he helps her to make her escape , and takes her to his island home .

		Presently , two of the most precious villains that even Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	has ever imagined arrive at the hotel , and
Schomberg	PERSON	determines to make them the instruments of his malignant revenge .

		He stuffs them with tales of the Swede in his solitary island , and of the treas - ure which is probably hoarded there .

		The prospect looks good to them , and they start off on the piratical venture .

		Now in any conven - tional story of this description , the villains would be thwarted , and their proposed victims would come out triumphant .

		Since we have to deal with Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	, it is all the other way about , and the story ends in a welter of trag - edy which leaves none of the four alive .

		The enigmatic title of the romance is accounted for by the way in which the young woman meets the ordeal .

		Heyst has not been sure of her love , but at the tragic climax every doubt is swept from his mind , and the two die united in soul .

		The story is told with the author 's grim strength , and has not a trace of the senti - mental palaver with which a lesser writer would beslobber its tense situations .

		Has any man ever known , as this one knows , the soul of the human derelict ?

		Mr.
Geoffrey Corson	PERSON	is a new writer , as far as our knowledge goes , and if '' Blue Blood and Red '' be indeed his first performance , it is a work of remarkable promise .

		In all the essen - tials of good fiction an interesting story , creative characterization , and style it is so far out of the ordinary as to stand as one of the half-dozen novels of the season 's output that deserve to be reread and remembered .

		It is a story of purely private interest , with
Staten Island	LOCATION	for its scene , and with its chief figures taken from two contrasting elements of the local society the aristocratic Carmichaels who live on the hill , and the plebeian McCoys who live on the shore .


Patricia McCoy	PERSON	is the heroine , and
Neal Carmichael	PERSON	the hero of her romantic dreams ; these two are predestined for one another , although life becomes a com - plicated coil for both of them before the con - summation of their union .

		Neal is engaged to
Patricia	LOCATION	early in the story , but the charms of
Ada Fleming	ORGANIZATION	, a heartless aristocratic beauty , weaken his allegiance , and
Patricia	PERSON	, realizing the situation , releases him from his bond .

		Nothing less than marriage with
Ada	ORGANIZATION	, and liv - ing with her for some years , is effective in destroying his infatuation , and making him realize the utter vanity and selfishness of her nature .

		Meanwhile ,
Patricia	PERSON	pledges herself to an admirer of her own class , who has long pursued her with dog-like devotion .

		Ada 's renewal of her flirtation with the Englishman to whom she had once been engaged provides Neal with adequate grounds for divorcing her , after which he renews his relations with Patri - cia , and , in a moment of passion , seduces her an episode which we wish had been spared us .

		This leads to
Patricia	PERSON	's flight to hide her shame , to the birth of her child , to her even - tual discovery by
Neal	PERSON	in the place of her concealment , and to the marriage which should have taken place long before , and which is a true union of hearts .

		The plot has vivacity and dramatic action , blending seriousness with humor , and giving us the final feeling that we have been living in the company of real human beings all the time that we have been following its involutions .

		The narrative abounds in passages of great beauty , for the author 's re - sources as a stylist are equal to every emer - gency , and respond to all the varied demands of his web of invention .

		The jaded reviewer , working his way through the loads of mediocre rubbish that clog the yearly output of fiction , does not often come upon so rich a prize as this admirable novel . ''

		La carriere ouverte aux talents '' might be the motto of '' The Ladder , '' by Mr.
Philip Curtiss	PERSON	, as it is supposed , generally speaking , to be the watchword of life in this Land of Opportunity .


Franklin Connor	PERSON	is , as the sub - title of the novel calls him , '' a casual man . ''

		There is nothing outstanding in his character or ability , but he is an expert base-ball player , and this fact , after he runs away from Aunt
Louise	PERSON	and domestic tyranny , stands him in such stead that the way is smoothed for him to go through college , although the honors he wins are anything but academic .

		Then he enlists as a soldier in the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, from which he emerges unscarred , but with an offi - cer 's rank , which in turn brings him political honors at the hands of a grateful common - wealth .

		So he climbs the social ladder , rung by rung , without any apparent effort , becomes engaged to the wrong girl and eventually mar - ries the right one , and illustrates in his career the ease with which the average American of good physique and commonplace intelligence can overcome most of life 's handicaps , and be - come a successful citizen of the republic .

		The story is typical of our social conditions , and for that very reason , without recourse to the sensational , and with only a sober and un - imaginative method of narration , contrives to make itself interesting in a prosaic way , and to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL impose its optimistic mood upon the reader .

		The only thing in the hero 's career which strains credulity is the fact that he is made to write , '' off the bat , '' and without any technical training whatsoever , a play which proves an immediate success , and places his material for - tunes beyond the reach of envious fate .

		The `` Lost Sheep '' of Mr.
Vere Shortt	PERSON	's tale are the men of the
French Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	.


Jim Lingard	PERSON	, an Englishman who has squan - dered a fortune in riotous living , finds him - self reduced to his last shilling , and enlists in the Legion as a desperate last resort .

		He has several years of adventurous service on the edge of the African desert , and barely escapes with his life from an uprising of the fanatical
Senussi	PERSON	.

		The daughter of the rebel chief teaches him the meaning of romance , and the sacrifice of her life in saving his provides an element of poignant tragedy .

		The end of the story leaves
Lingard	PERSON	, promoted for valor , quite satisfied with his career and evidently deter - mined to remain an officer of the Legion until the inevitable end overtakes him .

		The value of this book , aside from its quality of pictur - esque adventure , lies in its minute description of the life of the Foreign Legion a picture as different as possible from that given by '' ''
Ouida	PERSON	'' and other lady-novelists of both sexes , and evidently based upon an intimate acquaintance with the facts .

		The style is dull , and the invention anything but remarkable , but somehow a considerable degree of interest is sustained .

Fannie Caldwell Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, who was known as
Frances Little	PERSON	when she wrote '' The Lady of the Decoration '' and evidently prefers still to be called so , again adopts the
Japan	LOCATION	she knows so well for the scene of '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Misty Star : A
Romance of Youth	ORGANIZATION	and Hope and Love in
Old Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The narrative is told by an old American school-teacher long resident near a minor Japanese city , and its title is the name of lier cottage .

		To her come a missionary blessed with a faith that circumstances justify wonderfully , a young man who had been so stricken with tropical fever that he imagined himself to be a criminal , and the daughter of a widowed native whose husband -LRB- the girl 's father -RRB- was an American artist .

		Here is material for sentiment abundant and overflowing , and the author makes a great deal of it .

		The char - acters are drawn with a clearness that speaks well for
Miss Little	ORGANIZATION	's literary future .

		Pots and potters have been beloved of literature ver since the primeval discovery that they could lend so many apt figures of speech to the writer 's tale , and there is no sign of the lessening of their popularity to that end .

		The latest novel by Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	, ``
Brunei	LOCATION	's Tower '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is the story of an English master-potter who moulds his work-people to his will quite as he moulds and shapes his vases and other wares .

		There comes to his factory a youthful fugitive from justice , in whom the master sees material for the making of a character valuable both to himself and to the world .

		The boy repays this kindness with single-minded devotion , even to the doing of wrong that his employer may profit .

		Reproved and driven out for his allowing the end to justify evil means , the lad comes to repay evil with good .

		While the tragic ending is not implicit in the story , all that precedes it is so ably written , and the background is so fully symbolic of the characters before it , that the book deserves high praise as a piece of literary artistry .

		The mountain people of
North Carolina	LOCATION	among whom Mrs.
Payne Erskine	PERSON	has lived so many years furnish a beautiful flower-like creature for the pro- tagonist of `` A Girl of the Blue Ridge '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , whose development from a wild and primitive savagery to beautiful wifehood and moth - erhood is the theme of a good story .


Lury Bab	PERSON	, at the opening of the tale , is as wild and as beautiful in her youth as a rhododendron blossom , the child of a lovely and self-sacrificing mother and a father who lives by distilling illicit whiskey .

		Orphaned at the beginning of the book , she gives her love to a young man who is wrongfully accused of her father 's murder .

		Benevolent sisters from the North come to live near by , and under their care she develops to fine things .

		It is a story of skilfully contrived plot and incident , written out of full knowledge .

		By a somewhat strained coincidence the daughter by adoption of a
New York	LOCATION	multimillionaire and a popular novelist find themselves teaching in the same school in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		She is seeking an independent career outside the fashionable world for herself ; he is after material for a new Amer - ican novel .

		This is the basis for ''
Martha	PERSON	of the Mennonite Country '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , the latest of Mrs.
Helen R. Martin	PERSON	's novels dealing with an exotic civilization in the heart of one of the origi - nal colonies .

		The heroine of the story , however , is not the rich girl from the metropolis , but a sadly oppressed young woman , worked to death by a hateful stepmother .

		It is with this last disagreeable person that the novelist-teacher boards , and it is between the stepdaughter and him that the romance of the book works out , though the rich girl , after the manner of rich girls , does not go neglected .

		With something of the invincible spirit of her own
Miss Abigail	LOCATION	,
Miss Dorothy Canfield	PERSON	brings her literary gifts to the celebration of the small town in the book which she calls '' Hillsboro People '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		To that end she marshals no fewer than eighteen incidents and episodes and essays , rein - forced by several poems on
Vermont	LOCATION	by Mrs.
Sarah N. Cleghorn	PERSON	.

		The full flavor of
New England	LOCATION	is in them all , leaving the city dweller with a sense of impatience that he is denied intercourse with men and women , boys and girls , of so much personality and character .

		Most of us are only a generation or two removed from much such a life as is here painted in delicate colors , and the zest of it is still in our minds .

		This is an excellent collection of American stories .

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	Among recent novels which leave one the better at heart for having read them , '' Contrary Mary '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Miss Temple Bailey	ORGANIZATION	, deserves honorable mention .

		The heroine is a young woman of ideas and determination , who is not afraid of admiring men for their manly qualities .

		Her family fortunes are at a low ebb so low that she welcomes into her household a widowed clerk in government employment who has lost heart in his struggle with the world .

		How she brings him to a realization of the need for fighting honorably for his real place among men , rejecting a most eligible suitor meanwhile , makes excellent reading .

		The scene is laid in
Washington	LOCATION	, with politics far in the background .

		Miss
Alice Gerstenberg	PERSON	's novel , '' The Conscience of
Sarah Platt	PERSON	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , is redolent of femin - ism and modern problems arising between the sexes so much so that it rather ceases to be a novel at times .

		It is the story of a timid woman who failed to gain the man she loved in youth , only to meet him and give him her heart when he returned to her , an ill-mated husband , twenty-five years later .

		Tragedy , when the conscience is developed , is inher - ent in the situation .

		The narrative is open to a lawyer 's charge of multifariousness , and its mate - rial is imperfectly assimilated .

		But it holds out abundant promise for future success .

		It was hardly to be expected that the reader should be thrilled by ``
Allan	PERSON	and the Holy Flower '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- as he was years ago by Mr.
H. Rider Haggard	PERSON	's early tales of
Africa	LOCATION	and
Allan Quater	PERSON	- main .

		But nevertheless , this latest story of adven - ture shows no diminution of imagination .

		Interest here centres about a wonderful orchid , the father of all orchids , which is worshipped by a dwindling African tribe as a god .

		The story of how it was won through events teeming with peril , how it was lost in the moment of seeming success , and how the loss was eventually made good , makes an exciting tale .

		Taking the final campaign before
Napoleon	PERSON	's exile to
Elba	PERSON	and that following his return down through
Waterloo	LOCATION	, the Rev.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	makes a vivid and stirring romance , '' The Eagle of the Empire '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , which is in keeping with the events of the age .

		The hero is an officer of the Fifth of the Line , the heroine a daughter of the noble house he and his family have served through generations .

		Young
Marteau	PERSON	saves her from worse than death , to find a rival in a young English soldier of station .

		The romance threads the historical events with considerable skill , and the result is a story fully absorbing and workmanlike .

		A sequel to '' Uncle Terry '' has been written by Mr.
Charles Clark Munn	PERSON	and called '' The Heart of Uncle Terry '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The discovery of a pocket of tourmalines on the prop - erty of the old lighthouseman brings success to a young man , deprived of most of his heritage by his step-mother , and lends interest to the winning of the old fellow 's adopted daughter .

		It is a homely tale of
New England	LOCATION	, with the
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	's desire to get the better of somebody rather too strongly insisted upon .

		BRIEFS ox XE \ V BOOKS .

		Artists have painted the
Golden State	ORGANIZATION	, naturalists have described the wonders of her mountains and forests , historians have wrought out the tales of her padres and argonauts , enterprising boomers have flooded the marts of the conti - nent with glowing accounts of her fertility and her charms ; but it has remained for the poet really to portray her inner secrets .

		This is accomplished by Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	, in his ''
California	LOCATION	the Wonderful '' -LRB-
Hearst Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is no new tale of heroic endeavor or unflagging enterprise , no revelation of hitherto undiscov - ered resources , no unfrequented vista explored for the first time ; but rather , that greatest of all revelations , a human document portraying the subtile , conquering , compelling charm which
California	LOCATION	exerts over her adopted sons .

		Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's book lives up to its sub-title . ''

		her romantic history , her picturesque people , her wild shores , her desert mystery , her valley loveliness , her mountain glory , including her varied resources , her commercial greatness , her intellectual achievements , her expanding hopes , with glimpses of
Oregon	LOCATION	and Washing - ton , her northern neighbors . ''

		The work is very comprehensive ; Mr.
Markham	PERSON	deals with the whole of the great state , not the south - land only , as do many tourist writers ; he goes far back into the gray antiquity of the creative fates for the drama of the '' vast inf ramundane activity '' which gave birth to the Sierras and the Mother Lode .

		He traces the entrance of the Spaniard , and the inauguration of his scheme of Divine Practicalism to redeem the slothful and backward Indian from damnation and degeneracy .

		He relates the mad rush of gold-seekers which forever wiped `` maiiana '' from the calendar , put the gringo in the saddle of the Spanish cavalier , and ended the pastoral era .

		His accounts of the overland trail and of the days of '49 are particularly vivid and real - istic , for his own boyhood days were a part of that great drama .

		The same intimate contact with the
California	LOCATION	of yesterday and to-day is revealed in his pages recounting the rapidly changing development of her industries and agriculture , the transformation of untilled .

		ranch into the orchard watered by mountain snows , the marvellously successful growth of cooperative enterprise , the redemption of the desert , the story of alfalfa , and the welding into one people of the most cosmopolitan group of American citizens .

		The author is at his best in his poetic but pithy description of the gray - draped city of St.
Francis	PERSON	, a city which '' has an individuality , a glamour that has stirred the imagination of the world , the ultimate out - post of the passion of progress . ''

		The book is
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 387 unique also in its comprehensive and critical estimate of intellectual
California	LOCATION	, in the gal - axy of which the author himself is no minor luminary .

		The poetic turns , the vivid and illu - minating imagery of the language , and the flowing rhythm of these pages are a worthy tribute to the beauty and romance of

		charter making In his `` Municipal Charters : A for American Discussion of the Essentials 01 municipalities .

		Forms or Models for Adoption '' -LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Nathan Matthews	PERSON	has provided framers of municipal constitutions and stu - dents of municipal government with a con - venient and practical handbook of charter making .

		The author is an ex-mayor of
Boston	LOCATION	, past chairman of the
Boston Finance	ORGANIZATION	Com - mission , and lecturer on municipal govern - ment in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are few men in the
United States	LOCATION	whose knowledge of the theory of municipal government is so abundantly supplemented and tempered by prolonged experience in city administration .

		The principal thesis of Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	's book , namely , that municipal charters in the
United States	LOCATION	are , as a rule , poorly drawn , and that good government in a city presupposes a charter of proper proportions and precision , is not difficult to maintain .

		The tendency has been very general to overload charters with details , although the principal defect in some instances is rather the lack of detail .

		Dis - proportionate space is often given to certain subjects , and more recent charters exhibit especially the fault of over-emphasis upon political machinery , while administrative methods receive inadequate attention .

		There is too much hasty re-enactment and copying of the provisions of earlier charters , or of the charters of other cities , whereby defects as well as virtues are perpetuated and spread .

		There is little uniformity of language or arrangement , and there is commonly an un - necessary amount of repetition .

		The two principles , chiefly , which it is insisted should govern in the making of city charters are -LRB- 1 -RRB- that all matters which affect citizens of the State as such , rather than as members of a particular city , should be left to be controlled through general legislation , rather than in the city charter ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the political fea - tures of a charter should not be permitted to overshadow , or imperil the operation of , the more important provisions relating to the administration of the city business .

		Hundreds of city charters , it is affirmed , have brought disappointment to their authors because their administrative provisions have been inade - quate .

		`` Simplicity of political structure , accompanied by thoroughness in the admin - istrative details , must be the basis of charter reform . ''

		The volume closes with full drafts of city charters of two leading kinds , namely , the responsible executive type and the com - mission type .

		The future granary of the world .

		The latent and as yet scarcely developed resources of
Russia	LOCATION	's great
Hinterland	LOCATION	challenge the interest of the reader of Dr.
Fridtjof Nan	PERSON	- sen 's `` Through
Siberia	LOCATION	: The Land of the Future '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , and lead him to speculate as to the possibilities of the influence of this storehouse of food for the civilized world when once transportation shall flood the mar - kets of the continent with its meat , fish , and grain .

		Already 140,000 tons of Siberian but - ter go annually to
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The aim of Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's tour across the Kara Sea and up the
Yenesei	PERSON	was to test out the possi - bility of a steamship route in midsummer which would connect with river steamers on the
Yenesei	PERSON	and thus afford an outlet to the markets of
Europe	LOCATION	for the produce of Sibe - rian farms .

		Russian colonization in
Siberia	LOCATION	since the Russo-Japanese War has been fos - tered by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and has grown so rapidly that the question of transportation and markets is pressing for solution .

		The author advocates scientific surveys of the ad - jacent Arctic waters , the extension of the wireless services , and the use of aeroplanes to give prompt information of the opening of navigation , and of the location of ice lanes for the guidance of mariners who will use this sea route from
Europe	LOCATION	to the estuaries of the Obi and
Yenesei	PERSON	, a route little used but long known to hardy
Norse	ORGANIZATION	skippers .

		He contin - ued his journey along the Trans-Siberian Railway to the
Pacific	LOCATION	at
Vladivostok	LOCATION	, re - turning through the new Russian line in the Amur country .

		His book thus gives a bird 's - eye view of `` this boundless land , mighty as the ocean itself , with its infinite plains and mountains , its frozen Arctic coast , its free and desolate tundra , its deep , mysterious taiga , from the
Ural	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, its grass grown rolling steppes , its purple wooded hills , and its little scattered patches of human life . ''

		The agricultural and mining possibilities , the political and social problems , the economic and industrial aspects of
Siberia	LOCATION	are here summed up by a trained scientific mind keenly alert to the significance of the passing landscape , the mushroom towns of the chang - ing frontier , and the invading yellow hordes of Coreans and Chinese increasing in the
East	LOCATION	, from sixteen to twenty-four per cent of total population in less than four years .

		The 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	author has no fear that the colonization of this inland empire will lead to the deteriora - tion of the Russian stock , as it did to that of
Rome	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	and now threatens that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The contiguity of the land , the great mass of the Russian population , and the easy transfer of the Russian culture intact to these new lands all seem to insure the in - tegrity of the Russian nation and people in this expansion to the
East	LOCATION	.

		Her mission here is , so this veteran explorer believes , to be the bulwark of
Europe	LOCATION	against the `` Yellow Peril . ''

		Maps and a large number of excel - lent illustrations from photographs make even more real this illuminating picture of this future granary of the world .

		An iconoclastic Tt is difficult to understand the study of
Lowell	LOCATION	intellectual temper of a student of literature who devotes an entire volume to showing the deficiencies of an author ; it is more difficult still when he bases his attack on the denial of qualities which perhaps no discriminating reader ever imag - ined the author possessed .

		Yet this is what Dr.
Joseph J. Reilly	PERSON	has done in ''
James Rus	PERSON	- sell
Lowell	PERSON	as a Critic '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		It is true that
Lowell	PERSON	, after his enthusiastic recognition in
England	LOCATION	, was sometimes over-praised , and sometimes praised for the wrong things .

		But his greatest admirers have always been those who felt the charm of his personality , and who read his critical essays as the personal comments of one who knew literature and knew life , and who was above all a charming and high-souled man .

		It needs no elaborate series of citations to inform these readers that the essays are often whimsical , discursive , and rambling , or that they abound in contradic - tions arising from the approach to a subject from different angles , or from the discussion of the same subject in different moods .

		In
Lowell	LOCATION	's life-time , indeed , these contradictions troubled critics to whom consistency was a hobgoblin , and several of those emphasized by Dr.
Reilly	PERSON	are found in
Wilkinson	LOCATION	's list pub - lished more than forty years ago .

		Nor will the most grateful readers of
Lowell	LOCATION	deny Dr.
Reilly	PERSON	's other chief theses that '' his taste was intuitive , '' that '' he lacked philosophical depth of mind , '' and that he did not evolve a critical method like that of
Arnold	LOCATION	and
Sainte	ORGANIZATION	- Beuve .

		Dr.
Reilly	PERSON	cites passages to show that
Lowell	PERSON	himself was fully aware of most or all of these limitations .

		The conclusion that
Lowell	PERSON	was not a critic begs the question with a definition , and can only mean that
Lowell	PERSON	was not a sort of critic that he never claimed to be and that his closest readers never imag - ined him to be .

		The book is , throughout , un - sympathetic in tone , and sometimes seems unfair in its interpretation of
Lowell	LOCATION	's per - sonality ; but the author takes such evident joy in demolishing his man of straw that not even
Lowell	PERSON	's most enthusiastic friends could grudge him the pleasure .

		W P a ^ 6S f Mr >
Harold Begbic	PERSON	's little book on
Kitchener	LOCATION	, Organizer of Vic - tory '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- may lead the reader to con - clude that it is merely a piece of laudatory writing with no substance or value as a biog - raphy .

		In part this is true : Mr.
Begbie	PERSON	's book is in no sense a biography , it is a mere sketch of
Kitchener	LOCATION	's career , written appar - ently for the purpose of accounting for the great faith that Englishmen seem to have in the present occupant of the war-office .

		The sketch is not very laudatory , however , and the praise that Mr.
Begbie	PERSON	does award his hero is of such a character that even a modest man like Lord
Kitchener	LOCATION	is not likely to be pleased with it .

		The author describes his hero as a slow , heavy , somewhat dull man , with great talents as an administrator , but otherwise not possessed of striking abilities . ''

		Kitchener is by no means , for instance , a great general .

		Again , his statesmanship has never advanced out of gun range , because it is entirely without the genius that trusts humanity .

		In conse - quence he is something of a bungler , something of a blunderer . ''

		The general 's present posi - tion is due to what Mr.
Begbie	PERSON	calls the ''
Kitchener	LOCATION	legend , '' to which he devotes a chapter .

		The
Kitchener	LOCATION	legend , he tells us , grew out of the work of a brilliant newspaper correspondent , who in a
London	LOCATION	paper '' de - scribed the famous march to
Khartoum	LOCATION	, filling the grey commercial atmosphere of
London	LOCATION	with the rich colours of the
East	LOCATION	, with the exciting adventure of war , and with the still more exciting sensation of anxiety . ''

		It seems to be Mr.
Begbie	PERSON	's opinion that this legendary character is far - more useful in the present crisis than the real
Kitchener	LOCATION	, as it gives the English public the confidence in the govern - ment that is needed above everything else .

		The volume is illustrated with eight photo - graphs of Lord
Kitchener	LOCATION	taken at various periods of life and in various costumes , civil , military , Oriental , and academic .

J. N. Far	PERSON	- quhar ,

		He gave eight addresses , which have been carefully edited
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 and are now available in book form -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- .

		Fortunately , Mr.
Farquhar	PERSON	has not only had a varied and valuable experience in the land about which he writes , but also brings to bear sound methods of investigation and pre - sentation , with the natural result that he has given us a thoughtful and useful volume .

		After a brief but serviceable historical out - line , he enters upon a discussion of the '' Move - ments Favoring Vigorous Reform , '' such as the
Brahma Samaj	PERSON	.

		Then he turns to `` Reform Checked by
Defence	ORGANIZATION	of the Old Faiths , '' and under this general caption he writes about the
Arya Samaj	PERSON	, the
Vedic Mission	ORGANIZATION	, and nine simi - lar movements .

		In the fourth chapter he treats of the '' Full Defence of the Old Religions , '' with such subdivisions as Sectarian Move - ments in
Hinduism	LOCATION	, the Parsees , Sectarian Universities , and so forth .

		However , for most readers the two most attractive and suggestive chapters will prove to be those on '' Religious Nationalism '' and '' Social Reform and Ser - vice , '' not because they are more carefully writ - ten than the others , but from the nature of their subjects .

		In these sections , and indeed in all , Mr.
Farquhar	PERSON	insists that there has been a steady advance of the old faiths , and that all the reformation and revivification has been due essentially to Christianity : `` While the shaping forces here , have been many ,
Chris	PERSON	- tianity has ruled the development through - out . ''

		-LRB- Italics in the text . -RRB-

		Naturally this is a large question , which we may not discuss ; but it assuredly is one that every student of world history must find absorbingly interest - ing .

		We have just one serious complaint against our author , and that is for wasting so many pages on his circumstantial exposure of the frauds of
Madame Blavatsky	ORGANIZATION	and some of the other Theosophists .

		Of course his arraign - ment is most convincing ; but these vapid iniquities needed no further flaying for the class of readers to whom the present volume will appeal , and the space thus squandered might have been utilized for a more extended treatment of the '' Servants of
India	LOCATION	Society / ' for instance , or half a dozen other interest - ing and significant topics .

		The illustrations , chiefly portraits , are excellent .

		The story of
Belgium	LOCATION	's martyrdom .

		Dr.
Charles Sarolea	PERSON	, who has for twelve years been Belgian con - sul in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, has written movingly of the martyrdom of his native land in a book entitled , '' How
Belgium	LOCATION	Saved Eu - rope '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Americans , to whom the German invasion of that busy and contented land is the great unforgettable and unforgiv - able fact of the war , will read with absorbed interest this plain unvarnished tale which needs neither exaggeration nor rhetoric to bring it home to men 's bosoms .

		The author writes with restraint , though his indignation at times comes close to the surface .

		Having been himself an eye-witness of the first four weeks of the war , he is able to describe vividly those momentous operations around
Liege	LOCATION	,
Malines	ORGANIZATION	, and
Namur	LOCATION	which had such a far - reaching effect on the whole Western cam - paign .

		It is his profound conviction that Bel - gium has fought in defence not only of her own independence but also of the liberties of
Europe	LOCATION	and the sanctity of international law .

		In strict honor she was not bound to resist to the bitter end .

		After the first defence had been broken down , she might well have concluded an armistice with the enemy and thereby have tried to save herself from the horrors of a Ger - man occupation .

		In so doing she would have fulfilled her treaty obligations and have satis - fied the dictates of honor .

		But with a lofty political idealism and a touch of that mystical temper which we see in her great writers
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Verhaeren	PERSON	, she chose to lay down her life for her friends .

		She did not even complain when the Allies failed to come to her aid in time .

		Dr.
Sarolea	PERSON	is fully cog - nizant now of the reasons for that failure , the lack of preparation and the French tacti - cal blunder in attempting a premature thrust in
Alsace	LOCATION	; but he points out that at the time the delay not only made the Belgians heart - sick with deferred hope but also seriously up - set their military plans .

		The author himself witnessed certain German atrocities , which he describes without comment , preferring to dwell on officially authorized instances of ter - rorism , such as the destruction of
Louvain	LOCATION	and
Dinant	LOCATION	.

		A satire and some Mr -
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	, the one-act plays by veteran English playwright , has commemorated his
last winter	DATE	's visit to the
United States	LOCATION	by the publication of three one-act plays and a burlesque narra - tive , in a volume called '' The Theatre of Ideas '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The little dramas have all the ready cleverness of technique that Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's long practical experience with the stage has perfected .

		Their reader will not expect or find in them much stimulus in the way of thought , or much revelation of new methods in character study -LRB- although in the brief Cornish tragedy , '' Grace Mary , '' there is real human feeling beneath the banal story -RRB- ; their author has lived through his experi - mental period , and shows himself here as an accomplished craftsman rather than as an un - wearied and growing artist .

		Indeed , in the burlesque which gives the book its title , he reveals himself quite definitely and intention - 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 13	DATE	ally as the good-naturedly cynical foe of the intensely self-conscious younger school of dramatists who study parliamentary Blue - Books to find material for their plays and who seem to Mr.
Jones	PERSON	to be merely rocking ener - getically back and forth on a hobby
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	and hacking wildly with blunt wooden swords at whatever ancient convention or human tra - dition comes within reach of their arms .

		Universal suffrage , universal peace , universal panaceas of all sorts , he mocks in a serio - comic style , so much heavier than witty in its general effect that it hardly prepares one for the swift concluding explosion that wrecks the Theatre of Ideas , the School attached to it , and all its votaries .

		The ridicule is neither bitter nor pointed enough to leave a sting ; its neutral tone is perhaps but the inevitable re - flection of the American atmosphere in which Mr.
Jones	PERSON	conceived and wrote it as a half - jesting expression of some of the follies he hopes to see destroyed by the Great War .

Peterson	PERSON	of
McGill University	ORGANIZATION	,
Montreal	LOCATION	, is divided into two broad sections : the first dealing with
Canada	LOCATION	's external relations , and the second devoted to educational questions .

		The addresses on Im - perialism ,
Canada	LOCATION	's
Naval Policy	ORGANIZATION	, her rela - tions with the rest of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and with the
United States	LOCATION	, have an immediate interest in this period of world-wide upheaval .

		Prin - cipal
Peterson	PERSON	is an Imperialist , but not in any narrow sense .

		The federation of the British Empire he looks forward to is one that will make for mutual understanding and help - fulness among its scattered members , without the sacrifice of any essential principles of self - government .

		No intelligent onlooker can very well doubt that one of the better products of this disastrous war will be a readjustment of the relations between
Canada	LOCATION	and the other self-governing Dominions and the Mother Land .

		The part
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
New Zealand	LOCATION	are taking in the war , and the sig - nificant utterances of responsible statesmen both in
England	LOCATION	and in the Overseas Do - minions , make it clear that some means will be found of giving the outlying portions of the British Empire a voice in all questions of foreign policy , and all matters affecting the Empire as a whole .

		In the second division of his book , Dr.
Peterson	PERSON	discusses , from the point of view of a broad-minded and experi - enced educationalist , such vital questions as `` National Education , '' `` The Place of the
University	ORGANIZATION	in the Commercial City , '' `` Educa - tion and Business , '' and the `` Claims of Clas - sical Studies in Modern Education . ''

		A roiling stone Autobiography anonymously that gathered written brings up some curious questions of psychology .

		The author must feel that his career is interesting to the general public , or he would not describe it ; yet he seeks to avoid the fame his book might bring him , perhaps for the sake of greater freedom in telling the story of his life . ''

		Getting a Wrong Start '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- first appeared as a serial in the most popular of American weeklies a year ago .

		Then , as now , the author 's name was not disclosed .

		But there is manifestly only one American writer whose life fits into the facts here revealed .

		That writer is Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	, whose biog - raphy in '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' checks up in detail with the present book .

		The title of the volume indicates that the writer believes himself to have begun life badly .

		The reader may differ from him with abundant justifica - tion .

		He tried a number of things , in our national manner , before he discovered his fit - ness for authorship , law and journalism among them .

		In this way he served his ap - prenticeship , working hard and intelligently .

		When he came to the age of forty he wrote his first fiction .

		Since that time and he is now in his fifty-eighth year his success has been marked ; so marked indeed , that what he re - gards as a warning may well serve as an exam - ple .

		Especially interesting is his account of his marriage and wedded life ; this , too , seems to justify the wisdom of arriving at full matur - ity before plunging .

		Complete directions for a large number of games are included .

		Throughout the volume runs a note of faith in the value of keeping alive the play-spirit among the adults to whom is entrusted the guidance of the child .

		Mr.
H. Addington Bruce	PERSON	lias put together a series of detached and superficial essays under the irrele - vant title of '' Psychology and Parenthood '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Skimming along the '' popular '' waves of interest in defective or precocious children , in hys - teria and fear , in theories of laughter , of the sub - conscious , and of the genesis of genius , the book is made by culling - the most sensational aspects of the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 391 unusual cases .

		It contains material useful and use - less , correct and false , pertinent and impertinent ; it is uncritical in treatment and weak in motive .

		Such books may do some good by stimulating inter - est and more harm by satisfying it .

		In '' Discoveries and Inventions of the Twentieth Century '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , Mr.
Edward Cressy	PERSON	has pre - pared a useful companion volume to
Routledge	PERSON	's popular manual covering the same field for the preceding century .

		So rapid has been the increase of scientific activity that considerations of space have led Mr.
Cressy	PERSON	to modify in part the plan of the original and to select for his non-technical dis - cussions only the characteristic results of inventive enterprise during the last twenty-five years .

		While the book is adapted to the needs of the many rather than of the specialist , the author , with judicious discrimination , has given to each topic a far more comprehensive account than is usually found in handbooks prepared for the '' average man . ''

		In `` The True Ulysses S. Grant '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , General
Charles King	PERSON	has undertaken to digest for the general reader the enormous amount of biographical literature devoted to the career of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result is a very well-written biography , in which the narrative of military affairs is related in untechnical fashion and is wisely subordinated to the account of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's life taken as a whole .

		Throughout the book there runs a frank hero-worship , for which the critical reader must make kindly allowance .

		Especially will this consideration be demanded in that brief part of the work which treats of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's two terms as
Prest	PERSON	dent , and in the chapter which tells of his relations with
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	.

		The plan of the series in which the volume appears permits no footnotes , and there is no attempt at a bibliography ; but there is a good index , and the work is well illustrated .

		The perplexing allusion , such as one so often encounters in
Lowell	LOCATION	's learned page or
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's polished essay , will always be with us , or at least until writers choose to make their style as bald and unattractive as that of a textbook on arithmetic or geography .

		Hence the need of such books as Miss
Florence M. Hopkins	PERSON	's '' Allusions , Words , and Phrases that Should be Known , and Where to Find Them , '' a revised and improved edition of her earlier `` Allusions Which Every High School Student Should Know . ''

		Nearly fifty pages of not uncommon though not too obvious allusions , with indications of easily accessible sources of information concerning them , have been carefully prepared , and each printed page is faced by a blank one for additional entries on the stu - dent 's part .

		It is encouraging to learn from the author that she has been induced by the reception of her former work to prepare this second and more maturely considered treatise in the same field .

		Our younger writers betray their rawness -LRB- if that be not too harsh a term -RRB- in nothing so much as the thinness , the poverty , the unallusiveness of their style .

		Miss
Hopkins	PERSON	is librarian of the
Detroit Central High School	ORGANIZATION	, and her book may be had of the
Willard Company	ORGANIZATION	, of that city .

		She has in preparation a work on '' Reference Guides That Should be Known . ''

		Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	's '' Contemporary Portraits '' will be published next month by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		A play by Mr.
Louis J. Block	PERSON	, entitled '' The Judge , '' is soon to be published by
The Gorham Press	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	. ''


Michael O'Halloran	PERSON	'' is the title of Mrs.
Gene Stratton-Porter	PERSON	's new novel which will be issued in
August	DATE	by

		A new edition of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' Three Little Dramas for Marionettes '' is promised for early publication .

		The volume has been out of print for several years .

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	has completed his book on the making and conduct of the war , and it will probably be ready next month under the title of '' The World in the Crucible . ''

		Mr.
J. A. Fuller-Maitland	PERSON	's new work , '' The Consort of Music : A Study of Interpretation and Ensemble , '' will be published by the
Oxford Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press in a few weeks . ''

		The Dawn , '' a play by the Belgian poet
M. Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, will appear this month in a spe - cial edition from the press of
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume will contain an intro - duction by Mr.
Arthur Syrnons	PERSON	.

		Among the
May	DATE	publications of Messrs.
Doran	PERSON	are '' The Invisible Event , '' the concluding volume of the
Jacob Stahl	PERSON	trilogy by Mr.
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	, '' The Rat-pit , '' by Mr.
Patrick MacGill	PERSON	, and '' The Lie , '' a one-act play by Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	.

		Something of the warm attachment that existed between the two highly gifted brothers ,
Sidney	PERSON	and
Clifford A. Lanier	PERSON	, is said to be revealed in a vol - ume of verse by the latter , which will be published under the title of '' Sonnets to
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, and Other Lyrics . ''

		As a result of the welcome which
M. Artziba	PERSON	- shef 's novel '' Sanine '' has received in this country , Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	has arranged to bring out all of this author 's fiction .

		The next volume to appear will be '' The Millionaire , '' containing one short and two long stories .

		The sixth volume of the illustrated edition of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	, '' which Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	will have ready this month , completes a work which has been appearing quarterly under the editorship of Professor
C. H. Firth	PERSON	since
November , 1913	DATE	.

		It is impossible to foresee the influence of the great war on English literature in the future .

		Some of the precedents are dealt with by
Professor E. de Selincourt	ORGANIZATION	in a volume of lectures about to be published by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	under the title of '' English Poets and the
National Ideal	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's Gifford lectures on '' Theism and Humanity '' will be ready for publication shortly .

		Messrs.
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	received the complete manuscript from Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	a short time ago , and they anticipate that even in these stirring times the book will give rise to a good deal of discussion .

		392 THE DIAL -LSB-
May	DATE	IS Immediately forthcoming volumes in the '' Home University Library '' are : ''
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
R. C. K. Ensor	PERSON	; `` A History of Philosophy , '' by Mr.
Clement C. J. Webb	PERSON	; `` Political Thought : From

		Two noteworthy volumes of impressions and experiences of the European war are soon to be published in Mr.
Will Irwin	PERSON	's '' Men , Women , and War '' and Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	's '' Personal Phases of the War . ''

		Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	started for the war three days after it broke out , returning in
November	DATE	to organize the
Commission for Relief	ORGANIZATION	in
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		More than two hundred confidential military dispatches to President
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	from General
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	, which historians feared were hopelessly lost but which have been brought to light by Mr.
Wymberley Jones De Renne	PERSON	of
Georgia	LOCATION	, are to be issued this month by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The volume is edited by Dr.
Douglas Southall Freeman	PERSON	.

		Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph PennelFs	PERSON	book on lithog - raphy , soon to be published , contains chapters on the history of the art by Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	, together with a description and technical explanations of modern artistic methods by Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	, and is elaborately illustrated .

		The historical portion of the book is founded upon the volume by Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	issued in
1898	DATE	, and long out of print , but the book is new though based upon the old .

		A critical edition of '' The Poetical Works of
Robert Herrick	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
F. W. Moorman	PERSON	, will shortly be added to the '' Oxford English Texts '' series .

		In the present edition Dr.
Moor	PERSON	- man has been able to use the copy of '' Hesperides '' in the possession of Mr.
G. C. Macaulay	PERSON	, which gives the text as revised by the poet in the printing office .

		Those poems by
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	are also included which do not find a place in the
1648	DATE	volume .

		The need of fire-proof structures for valuable libraries received another lamentable illustration on the
26th of last month	DATE	, when a lively blaze in the basement of the
St. Paul Public Library	ORGANIZATION	caused the ruin , as is reported , of the large collection of books -LRB- 100,000 volumes , valued at
$ 150,000	MONEY	-RRB- sheltered by that building .

		Water , more than fire , did the actual damage , as is so often the case in similar instances .

		The total loss to the city is estimated at
$ 300,000	MONEY	.

		In a prefatory note to his forthcoming English edition of Dr.
Sven Hedin	PERSON	's `` With the German Armies in the West , '' Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	replies to his critics and states his reasons for publishing the work in
England	LOCATION	.

		The book , which is expected shortly , has already been parodied by Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	in a little book entitled '' In Gentlest Ger - many , '' with illustrations by Mr.
George Morrow	PERSON	.

		This will appear shortly after the publication of
Sven Hetlin	PERSON	's volume .

		Three forthcoming publications of
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	not previously announced are ''
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's Fruitlands , '' a compilation by
Clara Endicott Sears	ORGANIZATION	of all the writings on the subject of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's community at Fruit - lands ; `` Whither ? ''

		the anonymous essay which attracted wide and earnest comment when it ap - peared in the

Atlantic	LOCATION	'' ; , and '' Naval Occasions , '' by '' Bartimeus , '' present - ing a series of vivid pictures of the life at sea of the officers and men of the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Literary workers and peace advocates will be interested in a prize contest instituted by the
Christian Women 's Peace Movement	ORGANIZATION	, which enlists women of all denominations and claims a con - stituency of four millions .

		A prize of one hundred dollars is offered for a short story , not to exceed four thousand words in length , setting forth
Chris	PERSON	- tian ideals of peace .

		The manuscript should be typewritten on one side of the sheet only , and must be in hand not later than
June 15	DATE	.

		Competitors , should address the Christian AVomen 's Peace Move - ment , 705 Ford Building ,
Boston	LOCATION	, enclosing stamps - for return of their manuscripts if found unavail - able .

		In a forthcoming book entitled '' Shelley in En - gland , '' Mr.
Roger Ingpen	PERSON	utilizes information re - vealed since the publication of Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's biography of the poet as to
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's early life .

		More especially has the author availed himself of a mass of unpublished matter recently disclosed relat - ing to the poet and his family , including twenty - six new letters of
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		The volume contains a transcript of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's manuscript note-book , which , water-stained and tattered , was recovered from the `` Ariel , '' the boat in which he met his death .

		The illustrations include some family and other por - traits reproduced for the first time , as well as fac - similes from the manuscript note-book .

		Some unpublished letters of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, throwing many side-lights on the more intimate details of his life , are included in the memoirs of his wife , entitled ''
Emma Darwin	PERSON	: A Century of Family Letters , 1792-1896 , '' edited by her daughter ,
Henrietta Litchfield	PERSON	, which will be published in two - illustrated volumes .

		The first volume chiefly con - sists of the letters written by Mrs.
Darwin	PERSON	's mother ^ Mrs.
Josiah Wedgwood	PERSON	, and her sisters , now linked together and edited to complete a picture of the country life of an English family in
the first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		The life and letters of Mrs.
Darwin	PERSON	complete a work which was originally written for her grandchildren , and was privately printed in
1904	DATE	.

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	Upward 's new book , '' Paradise Found , '' which Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	will ' publish this month , is a critical extravaganza in dialogue form which is essentially a searching criti - cism of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and his ideas .

		The plot of the piece is this :
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, through enchantment , is cast into a trance , and in this form is preserved 1 by his followers as a sacred relic for two hundred 1 years .

		At the expiration of two centuries , he is awakened by a kiss into a world administered * entirely on Shavian principles .

		The re-awakened
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's disgust with the practical operation of his - ideas is developed with much humor ; but the reader finds when he is through that the Shavian philosophy has received a searching and at many points a destructive criticism .

		Other readers , though perhaps none more gracefully , have requested more frequent publica - tion of
The Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	.

		We believe , however , that as a rule the modern reader of periodical literature wants on the one hand frequent discus - sions of current events and books , and on the other , longer articles of a more reflective sort , published not too frequently .

		The next issues of the reading we wish to linger over should not come upon us too rapidly , and the articles they contain should be especially worth-while , with a freshness and significance especially long-lived .

		The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	is designed for those thou - sands of intelligent readers who desire to under - stand as fully as may be the scope and significance of the burning questions of to-day and who wish at the same time to enjoy articles of permanent literary character .

		Its nearly one thousand annual pages are assembled in four numbers , printed in large attractive type on imported

GRAHAME WHITE	PERSON	and

		This book gives in detail the activities of war aircraft in scouting , range-finding , bomb - dropping , etc. .

		The airman is constantly looking for important movements of the enemy , and his alertness prevents the hurling of large masses of troops at a weak spot .

		As a range-finder in modern warfare the air - craft is indispensable , as they are able to direct the artillery fire at most effective points .

		A most interesting feature is the description of battles between the various types of aircraft .

		BRIEFER MENTION 430 NOTES 431 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 432 THE NEW LITERATURE OF THE OCCULT .

		Unlike the moon , with its fixed hemispheres of light and shadow , the orb of humanity rolls restlessly from bright to dark .

		In the eight - eenth century there was a rationalizing day - light that peered into every crevice and cranny of the human mind .

		The nineteenth century tried to secure this clear certainty for all time by a system of science which pushed the Unknowable aside and set its own outposts on the farthest confines of space .

		But a change is now upon us .

		Whether we want it or not , the Occult and the Unknown are rising to dominate our thoughts .

		As to Hyperion on his glowing throne in
Keats	PERSON	's poem , `` omens obtruded , images obscure , '' so flocks of books about the supernatural and the psychic are wheeling into the world to-day .

		It is pretty sure that these books will influence man 's life sooner or later ; though indeed , superstition is so rooted in humanity that it needs little encouragement from doctrinal treatises .

		Crys - tal-gazing , fortune-telling , palm-reading , as - trological predictions , esoteric philosophies , all are flourishing .

		Nearly everybody one talks to has had some experience of these things , and admits some touch of faith in them .

		The most remarkable fact about the new literature of the Occult is that it has been pioneered or backed up by trained men of science , men whose names stand high in their own specialties .


M. Camille Flammarion	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	, Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	and Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, have spoken with no uncer - tain tones .

		A dozen or so years ago ,
M. Flam	PERSON	- marion essayed to place the whole subject on a scientific or experimental basis .

		He cast a huge drag-net and gathered in hundreds of cases of psychic experience , cases of halluci - nation , telepathy , transmission of thought , mental suggestion , communication from a dis - tance , astral bodies , which he presented in his book , '' The Unknown . ''

		His more recent work , `` Mysterious Psychic Forces , '' deals mainly with
Eusapia Palladino	PERSON	.

		His English compeers have dealt with the subject in scat - tered reviews , pamphlets , and addresses .

		A few years ago , Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	, in an 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	address to the
English Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	, stated unequivocally that '' there is no matter . ''

		With the work of these famous scientists may be joined the books of other trained and competent observers .

		Among the latter are Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	, whose recent large work '' On the Cosmic Relations '' essays to envisage the whole subject and to give it a definite ter - minology ; Mr.
Hereward Carrington	PERSON	, with his '' Personal Experiences in Spiritualism '' ; and Mr.
I. W. Heysinger	PERSON	, with his '' Spirit and Matter before the
Bar of Science	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A book entitled '' Death , '' published two or three years ago , which dealt with all the circumstances of the parting of the body and soul and particu - larly took a most unpleasant view of our chances for premature burial , is one of the most gruesome works we ever remember read - ing .

		And there has been an immense recent crop of ghost stories and records of super - natural happenings , English , Scotch , and Irish .


Andrew Lang	PERSON	alone slew his thousands of bogies .

		These tales show upon their faces that they are not the unassisted inventions of their writers .

		They are human documents , and therefore in some measure evidential .

		But anyone who is at all familiar with law - suits will have slight respect for the ability of the average human being either to know or to tell the truth about anything .

		Allied with these scientific or semi-scientific presentations of the psychic case , there have lately been published a good many books which view the subject in its historic aspects .

		Highly poetic in form , but substantially based on facts , is Mr.
Oliver Madox Hueffer	PERSON	's `` The Book of Witches . ''

		`` Werewolves '' by Mr.
Elliot O'Donnel	PERSON	, '' Vampires and Vampirism '' by Mr.
Dudley Wright	PERSON	, and '' The Romance of Sorcery '' by Mr.
Sax Rohmer	PERSON	exhaust their several subjects .

		`` New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large '' said
Milton	PERSON	, and it seems to us that the new scientific treatment of mys - terious psychic forces does not reveal any - thing which is not in the popular or poetic creations of the past .

		All the powers appar - ently possessed by mediums of whatever kind to-day have been in use by thaumaturgists and miracle-workers from the beginning .

		And as this old magic has a certain poetic glamour , we shall begin with the slightest and most per - functory sketch of it .

		As the fertile land in
Egypt	LOCATION	is only a fringe to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, an effluence of its waters , so to the ancient dwellers in that country human life seemed to be only something temporarily afloat on the great stream of death .

		They had their eternal pyramids as tombs for their kings , and their Cities of the Dead as real homes for the people .

		The Egyptians , indeed , seem to have lived only in order to be buried .

		At the most , life to them was a butterfly which flutters for a few days , while the mummy was the grub of permanent duration .

		They embodied their deepest thought in the figure of the Sphinx , half human , half animal .

		They projected the idea of the Veil which no one has lifted .

		In
India	LOCATION	, aside from its religions , mythologies , and philosophies , always changing and always mysterious , there have existed from the begin - ning vast systems of magic , sorcery , and mira - cle-working .

		One , the largest of the Vedas , is made up of spells , incantations , rituals of darkness .

		The Hindus seem to have consid - ered it quite as necessary to propitiate the demons as the gods .

		The Soona plant , the plant of intoxication , was worshipped by them ; it had its god and most obligatory ritual .

		The Buddhist system of penance , renunciation , and fasting has helped the Hindus to a clearness of thought , or an hallucination of mind , which - ever way one chooses to regard it , which has made their magic memorable .

		The ancient Per - sians were wonder-workers and wonder-believ - ers .

		Babylon had its
Magi	ORGANIZATION	, Belshazzar his Wise Men , and the rod of Aaron swallowed up the serpents of the Persian priests .

		The more modern Moslem inhabitants of that part of
Asia	LOCATION	have been soaked in superstition .

		The great wings of the Djinns , E frits , and Genie hover over and rustle through the Arabian Nights , which is a collection of popular tales .

		To every human being was born a familiar , to the female a
Ginn	PERSON	, to the male a Ginnee ; these grew up with the person , and if the lat - ter died young he was supposed to have been killed by his familiar .

		The clear and bright Greek mind tried for a time to banish the Occult and Unknown from the circle of humanity .

		Its work still remains the most sane and purely human the world has known .

		But there were plenty of shadowy places in Greek life and thought .

		Dodona with its Sibyls was the central heart of the race ; and though we do not know much about the Eleusinian Mysteries , they were probably concerned with the problems of the hereafter .

		The story of Medea and the novel of `` The Golden Ass '' show us that witchcraft flour - ished in its darkest forms in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		As for
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 407 the Romans , they started in life with a charm - ing outfit of domestic deities , Lares and Lem - ures , and as they grew in age they accepted anything in the way of superstition that was offered them from abroad .

		They were eclectic in their choice of tutelary guardians , and will - ing to give any supernatural power a chance .

		From the Greeks down to the present time there runs a line of laurelled and sceptred figures , men who were really daring experi - menters in science , but who were popularly accounted dealers in magic .

		Pythagoras ,
Empedocles	LOCATION	, Apollonius of
Tyana	LOCATION	,
Nostrada	PERSON	- mus ,
Roger Bacon	PERSON	, Dr.
Dee	PERSON	, and Cagliostro were some of these worshipped and feared and doubted personages .

		The Middle Ages placed even
Virgil	PERSON	among the magicians .

		Madame Blavatsky is perhaps the most striking recent example of the ability of a wonder-worker to command attention .

		Both
M. Flammarion	PERSON	and Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	were more or less impressed by her .

		The popular superstitions of the Middle Ages and of more recent times were limited in type but endless in manifestations .

		The idea of possession by the Evil Spirit or his agents underlies most of them .

		`` Wierus made a cen - sus of the demons , and counted up 7,405,925 of them .

		So they were not easy to escape .

		There is a story of a nun who forgot to say her `` benedicite '' before she sat down to supper , and who in consequence swallowed a demon concealed in the leaves of lettuce .

		Heine 's idea , possibly following
Milton	PERSON	, was that the demons and evil spirits generally were '' Gods in Exile . ''

		Deposed or degraded with their religions , they wandered about the world tak - ing up what odd jobs they could get or turning their powers upon mankind in revenge .


Wie	PERSON	- land the smith , for instance , was what was left of the magnificent Thor .

		Some of the uncanny creatures of the
Borderworld	LOCATION	, however , must have had a different origin .

		Vampires and Were-wolves must have been bad from the start .

		There is a recipe given in one of our books for getting rid of a vampire .

		With a picture of a saint in your hand you pursue it until you have it cornered in a large bottle .

		You cork this and throw it on the fire , and that is the end of the vampire .

		Lycanthropy , hereditary in some families , could be acquired by performing certain rites of
Black Magic	ORGANIZATION	.

		The experimenter went to some spot remote from the haunts of man , desert or wood or mountain top , on a night when the moon was new and strong .

		On a level piece of ground he marked a circle of seven feet in radius .

		In this he kindled a fire , and placed an iron tripod and an iron pot over it .

		.

		He boiled water into which he east handfuls of three of these substances : asafcetida , parsley , opium , burdock , henbane , saffron , aloe , and solanum .

		Repeating a rhymed charm , he took off his vest and shirt and smeared his chest with the fat of a newly killed cat .

		He then bound around his loins a wolfskin and kneeling down waited for the advent of the unknown , which when the fire grew dim and cold and terror froze his blood appeared in some monstrous shape , half man and half animal .

		We are particular to give this formula because it ap - pears to have been the regulation thing , not only for becoming a Were - wolf but for sum - moning the Master of Evil in almost any predicament .

		In the last scene of
Bulwer Lyt	ORGANIZATION	- ton 's `` Strange Story '' it is repeated pretty faithfully .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	considers the Witch the femme incomprise of the world .

		He follows her through all the irregular routine of her life .

		One thing is certain she strikes root more firmly in fact and history than most of the phantasms of superstition .

		There were women , hordes of them , reputed to be witches , perse - cuted as witches , burned as witches .

		Mother
Shipton	PERSON	,
Mother Redcap	PERSON	, the Witch of Wap - ping , Mother Demdyke , our old friend
Eliza	PERSON	-
beth Sawyer	PERSON	, immortalized by
Ainsworth	PERSON	, the Witch of
Edmonton	LOCATION	, who furnished
Ford	ORGANIZATION	and
Dekker	PERSON	with a play , all these were historic characters .

		Nay ,
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	was burned as a witch .

		In
Sweden	LOCATION	there was a mania about witch children : multitudes of them , though watched in their sleep , reported that they had been transported to
Blockula	LOCATION	, the
Northern Brocken	ORGANIZATION	.

		But let us bid adieu to those dear old days , and turn to the present material times when , as one of our authorities asserts , spiritual manifestations are ninety-eight per cent fraudulent .

		Others make out a better case for them ; but still there is a general opinion that all the modern mediums , the
Davenport	PERSON	brothers , Mr.
Home	PERSON	,
Lily Dale	PERSON	,
Eusapia Pal	ORGANIZATION	- ladino , and Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	, whatever powers they may have possessed , were never averse to eking these out by trickery .

		The range of their manifestations is considerable ; but , as we said before , there is nothing very new about them , except where modern appliances have THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	placed new instruments in their hands .

		Spirit photography , for instance , could not have been exploited in past times .

		On the other hand , the `` Poltergeist , '' a thing which rings bells , breaks crockery , and throws objects about , is only
Robin Goodfellow	PERSON	come again .

		But there is a vast range of psychic expe - rience which does not depend upon mediums , and about which there is gathering a mass of evidence scarcely to be ignored .

		About the factual truth of hypnotism , mental sugges - tion , and telepathy there can be no question whatever .

		Distant communication , levitation , astral appearances , ghosts , are more open to doubt ; but there are crowds of honest people who are willing to swear to their reality .


Cole	PERSON	- ridge said that he had seen too many ghosts to believe in them .

		The present writer has had a few creepy experiences of this kind , but they are too slight and too uncertain to be worth relating .

		Some other psychic conditions he has known may perhaps be of interest .

		When a very young man , he put in nearly two years in the South American jungle as one of the managers of a great railroad expedition .

		He was pretty constantly fever-stricken and al - most as constantly starved .

		He was shot , had to contend with many mutinies , pursue hostile Indians into the forest , and struggle with native creditors .

		As a result , upon his return home , he was conscious of some queer states of mind .

		For one thing , the immediate past was blotted out , or could only be recalled by an effort ; but in its place was substituted an expedition entirely different and even more striking , which filled his waking mind with the vividness of reality .

		Another thing was this : he had at that time published nothing ; but the feeling was so strong in him that he had not only written but published a large dramatic poem , that he would frequently go over to the bookcase to pick out the volume .

		Another strong impression was that he pos - sessed the power of levitation , that he needed only to touch his toes to the ground occasion - ally to propel himself long distances through the air .

		He certainly never attempted to put this gift into practice , but the sense that he possessed it was a snug satisfaction to him .

		Of course these were hallucinations ; the writer was temporarily a trifle cracked .

		But that raises the question as to how far dementia and inspiration are apart .

		The Indians held that the manifestations of insanity were sacred ; and
Swedenborg	PERSON	and the mystics gen - erally , to judge by their lucubrations , must have been somewhat of this opinion .

		What is the good of it all ?

		As someone in one of the volumes we have mentioned says , `` What good is a baby ? ''

		That the super - natural can not be proved may be granted .

		What can be proved ?


Newton	PERSON	said that gravi - tation , the attraction between distant bodies , was impossible ; and
Faraday	PERSON	urged cogent arguments against his own conservation of energy theory .

		The nebular hypothesis and the atomic theories must probably go to the scrap-heap .

		If the shadowy impressions of the unknown and the unseen , the belief in immortality , the sense of immaterial presences , are part and parcel of the human mind , as all but universal experience would indicate that they are , then they are as much a part of life as anything else which seems to us to exist .

		Our crass everyday life of work and play , eat - ing and drinking , dressing and going about , is not permanently satisfying to anyone .

		Hu - manity has always revolted against it , and demanded something more `` filling . ''

		It has built temples , raised banners , created arts , in order to gratify its need for a better and worthier existence .

		The supernatural is really the initiative of most of these efforts ; and the more , in a reasonable way , we work with the supernatural the greater and nobler our arts , religions , and thoughts become .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE SPEECH-ACQUIRING YEARS , with most persons , are limited to the earlier years of their lives , ability to make any appreciable additions to one 's vocabulary diminishing rap - idly after adolescence .

		Hence the importance , as a rule , of putting language studies early in the educational course .

		Some light on the vexed question of the range of words used by normal children , and the growth of their vocabulary , is thrown by a minutely attentive study of his own boy , up to the age of two years , by Professor
Thomas Percival Beyer	PERSON	, whose researches , first published in the '' Edu - cational Review , '' now appear in separate pamphlet form .

		With admirable curbing of parental pride , the writer claims no precocity or other unusual attribute for his child ; he simply calls him '' an actual child of normal antecedents -LRB- no jail-birds or geniuses for four generations back -RRB- , '' and yet at one year of age his vocabulary numbered about twenty sym -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 409 bols , including perhaps ten veritable English words , and five months later this stock had grown to '' 160 words , most of them English , '' while at the end of the twenty-fourth month the number was 771 .

		This list is printed .

		Noteworthy is the increasingly rapid enlarge - ment of the child 's vocabulary , and the fact that , like other children , he now , in his third year , shows a decided acceleration of speed in acquiring new words , so that at his next birth - day he is likely to command a vocabulary of
2200	DATE	, and possibly 2500 words .

		Compare this readiness of word-acquisition with the average college student 's sluggishness in the same particular .

		Commenting on the correla - tion between thought and language , the writer asks : '' Therefore shall it not become a shame - ful thing and not to be tolerated for college men and women to continue to do business upon the verbal capital inherited from their unconscious childhood , plus a few hundred words absorbed during their imperfectly con - scious school-days ?

		Shall the teacher of En - glish not demand some conscious effort to augment the needs of the organ of thought ?

		Tooting on the pipes of infancy continues childish music through adult life .

		It will be only by adding new avenues of intake and outgo that adult life and thinking can grow into the richness and variety and color that should be the personality . ''

		A notable discov - ery was made by Professor
Beyer	PERSON	in the fact that his boy showed an early command of a great variety of vowel and consonant sounds not present in our language , so that selection seemed to play an even more important part than imitation in his speech .

		This chimes with the results of recent research in child-psy - chology .

		Although one suspects baby
Beyer	PERSON	to be a rather exceptional infant , he gives us nevertheless matter for useful generalization .

		THE FIRST LIBRARY BUILDING FOR CHILDREN , and for children only , is
Brooklyn	LOCATION	's note - worthy contribution to recent library develop - ment .


Brownsville	LOCATION	is the fortunate section of the city to be favored with this useful and already much-used addition to the general library system .

		For the three months follow - ing its opening the children 's building was visited by an average of 1,566 juvenile book - borrowers daily ; and , further than that , re - ports the librarian , '' the quality of the reading and the admirable order of the children de - serve notice far more than do mere figures of use . ''

		It is significant that the youngsters , who are from the primary and grammar grades only , make such demands for non-juvenile lit - erature that an ample equipment of '' adult '' books has been found necessary , and has been provided .

		A few more items of importance are to be noted . ''

		Up to seven o'clock , daily , this whole library is given over to the circulation of books .

		From seven to nine P. M. the place changes to a reading and reference library , and all the seats in the beautiful main rooms are filled with reference workers and earnest readers ... Another departure of this year has been the opening of a training course for children 's librarians .

		The experience of years in being unable to secure from the library schools enough trained workers for this de - partment has practically forced us into giving our own course of training . ''

		Conspicuous in the scheme of things bibliothecal has been the recent rapid increase in consideration enjoyed by the juvenile user of the public library , especially in this country .

		May the American child , already fairly well imbued with a sense of his own importance , be able to preserve some remnant of bashfulness and modesty under this indulgent treatment !

		A NOTABLE ESSAY COMPETITION , already re - ferred to by us as instituted by the
Carnegie Church Peace Union	ORGANIZATION	, and brought to a close with the opening of the current calendar year , has resulted , so far as the highest honors are concerned , in the award of the first prize -LRB- one thousand dollars -RRB- to Rev.
Gaius Glenn Atkins	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, pastor of the
Central Congregational Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Providence	LOCATION	, B. I. Competition for this prize was restricted to pastors of churches in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Three lesser prizes , offered to students in theological seminaries , have been bestowed upon Mr.
E. W. Nelson	PERSON	, of
Phillips University	ORGANIZATION	,
East Enid	ORGANIZATION	,
Oklahoma	LOCATION	; Mr.
P. V. Blanchard	PERSON	,
Andover Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	; and Mr.
R. Niebuhr	PERSON	,
Yale School of Religion	ORGANIZATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		The ten prizes offered to church members were all won by men , which may cause some surprise in view of woman 's pronounced interest in the cause of peace .

		Some phase of this question , it will be remembered , was the topic on which all competing essayists were to write .

		Dr. At - kins 's essay , entitled '' The Causes of War , '' parts of which have been quoted by the news - paper press , points out some of the notable steps in the progress of the race that he al - leges to have been effected through the instru - mentality of war , and then seeks to explain why the world at large is to-day so doubtful of the efficacy of pacific measures to accom - plish like results . ''

		Evidently , '' he says in explanation , `` because we have failed to see that the solution of any question on the very highest levels is an immensely more difficult and heroic thing than its solution on lower levels .

		We fight because fighting is easier than 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	keeping the peace ; war is not , as its apologists would tell us , a high and heroic way out of international difficulties ; it is the low and cowardly way .

		It is easier to take arms against a neighboring people than to sit around a council table and work out in wisdom and brotherhood and self-restraint , the questions which the war involves .

		However we may differ as to the wisdom of turning the other cheek , we must agree that it takes a braver man to turn the other cheek when he does it as a matter of principle than to strike back . ''

		A second tournament of pacific essayists un - der the same auspices , and to close with the end of the year , is now in progress .

		THE PUBLISHER 'S RISK IN CHEAP REPRINTS ought not to be lost sight of in contemplating the considerable profits on the most widely circulated of these promoters of popular cul - ture .

		The lower the price , other things being equal , the larger the sales ; but unless there is a clear profit , however small , on each copy sold , the larger the sales the heavier the losses .

		A certain salesman in a mammoth department store was once asked how it was that his house could afford to sell at a price alleged to be below cost a certain article advertised among its bargains .

		`` Why , you see , we make our - selves whole by selling such an enormous num - ber , '' was the salesman 's glib rejoinder .

		The shilling copyright novel that seems to have established itself in the English book-trade , can only be produced in its present grade of mechanical excellence on the assurance of large sales , so that untried talent can hardly hope for a chance to appeal to the great pub - lic in shilling volumes .

		The whole cost of production has been , of necessity , reduced to an astonishingly low figure , and a royalty of one penny on each copy sold has to be reck - oned in before the dealer 's profit can be deter - mined .

		The latter is said to be as much as fivepence per copy , divided perhaps between the wholesale and the retail handler of the book , so that to one examining the matter the marvel is that so good an article can be manu - factured and sold without bankrupting some - body .

		No wonder there is risk in the operation , and an imperative necessity of large and brisk sales .

		... IN MEMORY OF
EPHRAIM WILLIAMS	PERSON	, the gal - lant soldier who served with distinction in
King George	LOCATION	's War , built
Fort Massachusetts	LOCATION	, near
Williamstown	LOCATION	, commanded a
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts regiment in the French and Indian War , lost his life in the battle of
Lake George	LOCATION	,
Sept. 8 , 1755	DATE	, and -LRB- his chief claim to immor - tality -RRB- founded at
Williamstown	LOCATION	the free school which afterward became
Williams Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , in memory of this brave soldier , ardent patriot , and true gentleman , some utterances on the occasion of the two-hundredth anniver - sary of his birth have of late found their way into print and are deserving of note , especially as it has not often been given to an American college to celebrate the bicentennial of its founder .

		From Professor
John H. Hewitt	PERSON	's commemorative address let us quote a sentence or two . ''

		That
Colonel Williams	PERSON	was a man of superior native gifts which he had culti - vated is evidenced not only by his letters , whose directness and terseness remind one of some of the letters of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	written on the field of battle , but also by the list of books mentioned in his will , which books show that he was a man not only of wide reading for that time , but of good literary taste ... I have sought in vain to find in his letters any expression of malice or ill-feeling toward any to whom , or concerning whom , he was writing .

		That he was a gentleman , in the widest sense of the term and with all that the word implies , is evident from the following statements of President
Fitch	PERSON	, whose words undoubtedly express a reliable tradition : ' His address was easy , and his manner pleasing and con - ciliating .

		Affable and facetious , he could make himself agreeable in all companies ; and was very generally esteemed , respected , and beloved .

		His kind and obliging deportment , his generosity and condescension , greatly en - deared him to his soldiers .

		By them he was uncommonly beloved while he lived , and lamented when he died . ' ''

		... A RENOVATED AND ENNOBLED FRENCH PRESS forms the subject of a well-written though somewhat florid article by
M. Alfred Capus	PERSON	, member of the French Academy , in the '' Revue Hebdomadaire . ''

		After reviewing the important part thus far played by French journalism in the present crisis , the writer says , toward the end : '' Despite all the blem - ishes in its history , the press deserves now our full confidence : in these tragic days it has discovered the extent of its influence on opin - ion and the importance of its role during the war .

		All the phases of the conflict are re - flected in its columns , as are all the emotions , all the hopes , of the French soul .

		It has be - come more narrowly entwined in the life of the country than it ever was ; it has inter - preted the sentiments of
France	LOCATION	, it has faith - fully represented
France	LOCATION	in action ; and this collaboration
France	LOCATION	can never forget . ''

		Strengthened and ennobled , affirms
M. Capus	PERSON	, will be the French press that emerges from this national struggle , and finally : '' On look -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 411 ing back it will perceive the risks that it once incurred , and how , at certain moments , it came near to forfeiting its good name by in - dustrialism and violence : and how , then , it recovered its balance and acquired morality , culture , and poise .

		The war of
1914	DATE	will prove to have been its supreme test .

		Far from having foundered , it has taken on an incomparable air of dignity .

		It has bathed itself anew in its true well-spring , and it has seen of what it was capable when it was de - fending the cause of the Fatherland .

		Its role during the war will have been the glorious prelude to its role after the war , when the country will have to be reconstituted and
France	LOCATION	set back upon the true course of her history . ''

		... A NEW RUSSIAN GENIUS makes his advent in our western world through a series of transla - tions that have been appearing with increasing frequency during the last few years . ''

		Poet Lore '' seems to have been among the first to discover the noteworthy quality of Leonid Andreieff s dramatic compositions , for as long ago as
1907	DATE	it printed an English version of '' To the Stars , '' and
four years later	DATE	it admit - ted to its pages '' King Hunger . ''

		`` Anathema '' was published in
1910	DATE	by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' Sawa '' and '' The Life of Man '' by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	in
1914	DATE	, '' Karal '' and '' The Sabine Women '' achieved publicity the same year , as also '' Love of One 's Neighbor , '' and the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	have this year issued '' The Black Maskers , '' '' The Life of Man , '' and '' The Sabine Women . ''

		Duplications in the forego - ing list indicate different translations , and mark also a notable measure of popularity .

		In due time this new writer may become even bet - ter known to our theatre-goers than to our book-readers .

		Realism seems to be the charac - teristic of his earlier plays , as also of the stories he wrote when first essaying authorship as a means of support ; but idealism , the stuff that dreams are made of , found a place in his art not long afterward .

		The tragic intensity of the Russian temperament is not wanting in this writer , whose hard life at one time brought him to the verge of suicide .

		The fact that he has by turns plied the brush of a portrait-painter and carried the green bag of a lawyer , besides acting at times as private tutor , proves the versatility of his talents and helps to quicken our interest in his many-sided per - sonality ... RETROSPECTS OF A QUARTERLY REVIEWER agreeably fill some pages of one of our current magazines .

		Senator
Henry Cabot	PERSON	Lodge con - tributes to '' The North American Review '' a reminiscent sketch of his early connection with that periodical when it was wont to appear only four times a year instead of twelve .

		It was in
1872	DATE	, he tells us , that he became , to his great pride and delight , its assistant editor , a position that he held until
1876	DATE	.

		After contemplating the vicissitudes this centenarian has passed through , he thus concludes his pleasant memories : '' Yet ' The North American Review ' survives , more fre - quent in publication than at the outset , but more vigorous than ever .

		Best of all , after many wanderings and in these days of haste and hurry , the restoration of the qualities which gave it its old position has been found possible , and the criticism of literature and the purely literary articles have returned to its pages , where they were once thought to be fatal to popularity and to sales .

		To those who are interested in American literature and let - ters , this is encouraging in a direction where encouragement is much needed , and should be a matter for congratulation to all who care to see serious subjects seriously and ably treated , whose intellectual appetites are not wholly sat - isfied by pictures , and who would not have literature forgotten in a great periodical re - view .

		It is an especial satisfaction to one who , like myself , has a personal affection for our century-old ` Review , ' and who can not even repeat the name without calling up some happy memories from a past which now seems very distant in this fast-moving if not always improving world . ''

		MARK TWAIN 'S CONTRIBUTION TO BELGIAN RELIEF would have been no stinted one had his life been extended into these soul-harrowing times .

		That with tongue and pen he would have made some pertinent and memorable utterances concerning
Belgium	LOCATION	's part in re - cent history , there can be no doubt ; nor would other and more substantial evidence of his attitude have been wanting .

		What he can not now do in person his literary executor , Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	, has attempted in some small measure to do for him by contributing to the recent auction sale of authors ' manu - scripts in aid of
Belgium	LOCATION	an unpublished piece of writing from Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	's pen enti - tled '' The New War Scare , '' written in
1898	DATE	and covering twenty-nine pages in the author 's handwriting .

		This sale , instituted at Dr.
Ros	PERSON	- siter
Johnson	PERSON	's suggestion , and carried out under the auspices of the Authors ' Club in
New York	LOCATION	, took place on the twentieth of this month at the Anderson Galleries , whose pro- prietors gave their services , in printing and distributing the catalogue and conducting the sale , as their contribution to the cause , while our Minister at the
Hague	LOCATION	, himself a member 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	of the club referred to , took upon himself the .

		distribution of the accruing fund .

		Long and impressive is the list of authors , American and English , whose manuscripts or other contribu - tions , such as volumes of their works with autograph accompaniments , went to swell this rather remarkable sale .

		Welcome and consid - erable as will be the fund placed in Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's hands for the relief of suffering , the significance of the event , in its several aspects , is far greater ... , THE CHILDREN 'S NEED OF SHAKESPEARE as an educative influence in their formative and impressionable years was wisely emphasized by Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	in a parting utterance as she embarked for
England	LOCATION	a short time ago .

		`` As for the Germans , '' she is quoted as saying , `` one must acknowledge that they honor Shakespeare in the best of all possible ways , by the frequent performance of his dramas .

		I wish
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	would do even more , by building a theatre in his honor .

		You know , in
Germany	LOCATION	you can hardly go into a city without finding a performance of one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , while here and in En - gland , of late , ' it is a custom more honoured in the breach than the observance . '

		And do n't you know , I feel that this neglect of Shake - speare is akin to a crime .

		For what about the children who are growing up now ?

		Are they to know nothing of the work of the greatest master of the English stage ?

		Must they go through their lives without the wonderful in - spiration that the beauty and poetry of Shake - speare gave those of us who are older and had the opportunity to see his plays in the forma - tive period of our lives ?

		It is the children I am pleading for when I plead for Shake - speare . ''

		But it is possible , in the dearth of Shakespeare performances on the stage , for children to catch something of his magic charm from the printed page , from
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	's '' Tales '' if not immediately and in tender years from the plays themselves .

		One is reminded here of the late Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's expression of '' measureless content '' whenever he heard of young readers being kindled to new zeal for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	study by any word of his .

		... AN ADDITION TO THE EPHEMERAL LITERATURE OF THE WAR is promised in the near future in the form of '' a real American newspaper , '' to be published in
New York	LOCATION	by certain German - American organizations of that city , and striv - ing to be '' absolutely impartial , doing full justice to the German cause . ''

		A warrant for the attainment of the latter half of this pur - pose , if not of the first , may be found in the announcement that Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	will act as head of the publication 's advisory board ; and another noted scholar and writer of German extraction , Dr.
Hugo Schweitzer	PERSON	, an industrial scientist who has written with au - thority on
Germany	LOCATION	's economic and industrial condition , will hold the office of president of the publishing association which is to put the new journal into circulation .

		The number of periodicals which the war has called into being , most of them in
Europe	LOCATION	, of course , is now beyond counting , as is also the multitude of smaller newspapers and magazines that have been forced by the same agency to suspend publication .

		The mark of militarism , in its present manifestation , is impressing itself in various unmistakable ways on the world of print , no less than on the world of politics , economics , commerce , agriculture , manufac - turing , social intercourse , and in fact nearly every other form of human activity .

		... A NOTABLE GIFT TO
WILLIAMS	PERSON	COLLEGE LIBRARY is reported .

		The giver is Mr.
Alfred C. Chapin	PERSON	, a graduate of the college in the class of
1869	DATE	, and already known for his gift of
Grace Hall	ORGANIZATION	, the beautiful auditorium that adorns the campus .

		This welcome addition to the library is a collection of rare and valuable old books , chief among them being a perfect copy of
John Eliot	PERSON	's Indian Bible , a copy con - cerning which the assertion is made that no other now known to be in existence is in so good a state of preservation .

		A second folio

Bacon	PERSON	's `` Advancement of Learning , ''
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	's '' Liberty of Prophecy , '' and
Milton	PERSON	's '' Liberty of Unli - censed Printing '' these are a few of the more important items in the collection .

		The
Bryant	PERSON	volume finds a singularly appropriate resting-place -LRB- it is too precious to circulate -RRB- within the precincts familiar to the poet in his student days , now more than a century ago .

		By a fortunate coincidence , though there may be a causative relation in it , the college trus - tees have just voted an extensive addition to the congested library building , one that will provide much additional shelf room for the growing book-collection .

		NEGLECTED CENTENARIES seem to be very much the order of the day in these troubled times .

		The excellent
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	's birth occurred one hundred years ago
last month	DATE	-LRB-
April 24	DATE	-RRB- , but the centennial recurrence of that date caused hardly greater commotion in the world at large than did his first appearance on this mortal scene .

		Another English nov -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 413 elist of nearly equal fame was the object of similar neglect when his centenary occurred last
summer	DATE	some weeks , too , before the fatal first of
August	DATE	.


Charles Reade	PERSON	is prob - ably better known for a comparatively small amount of good work than
Trollope	PERSON	for an unusual number of novels of well-sustained excellence .

		But neither '' The Cloister and the Hearth '' nor the Barchester series has proved potent in arousing any considerable centennial enthusiasm over their respective authors .

		In a few weeks there will fall another and even more important centenary , of a very different character , but for obvious reasons no uniting of the nations in celebration of the event is to be expected , albeit a sort of unpremeditated reproduction of that historic occurrence on the Belgian plain to the south of
Brussels	LOCATION	, when the eighteenth day of
June	DATE	next comes around , is not beyond the bounds of possibility .

Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's literary reputation , once a liability , is no longer held against him .

		If he can explicate the Mexican complication , reduce the cost of living through tariff legislation , not only bust some trusts but subject the great offenders to com - plete combustion , and secure the approval of the trend of events on the Repeal of Canal Tolls Ex - emption , Regional Banks , and his refusal to bestow his name on his grandson , the nation may even be willing to forget that he once taught in a Methodist college and later , miserabile dictu , in a Presbyterian university .

		But what right-minded
Thomases	PERSON	every - where can never forgive is that he deliberately con - ceals the source of his literary inspiration ; he repudiates his ''
Thomas	PERSON	. ''

		This is inexplicable from every point of view except one which hints darkly of early ambitions for power .

		Europe never had an important
King Thomas	PERSON	.

		There seems to be a shy , sturdy , inde - pendent quality in the name which renders it unfit for either a truckling adventurer or a conquering leader .

		So our President was willing to accept the hereditary benefactions of his name , so potent in literature ; but fearful of its political threat , he has not acknowledged it in public .

		It may or may not be regarded as worth noting that
America	LOCATION	has had just two literary presidents , and they were both christened ''
Thomas	PERSON	. ''

		True ,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	committed to posterity some speeches acknowledged the greatest pieces of ora - tory in the nineteenth century ; but he was not primarily a man of letters .

		Certain other presi - dents have committed themselves to paper ; but they were not and are not even secondarily men of letters .

		It can not be seriously questioned that we have had just two literary presidents ,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	and
Thomas Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Why they should both be Democrats I do not at this moment know , though I have no doubt one could in a short time evolve a very good reason . -RRB-

		Didymus , one of the twelve , the first historical
Thomas	PERSON	, and the only one whose Didymic claims have the slightest plausibility , has enjoyed the usual notoriety of the scientific pioneer .

		But for all that , his doubt has proved of more service to the spread of his Master 's good news than has the faith of
Peter	PERSON	.

		The Middle Ages paid him tribute by naming three of its greatest men for him :
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, scholar ,
Thomas a Kempis	PERSON	, saint , and
Thomas	PERSON	a
Becket	LOCATION	, soldier-statesman-priest-martyr .

		What triumvirate of Johns or
Williams	ORGANIZATION	or Georges in the Middle Ages can compare with these three ?

		Possibly to the extraordinary popularity of the last-named is due the immense harvest of English Thomases that has followed .

America	LOCATION	, be it said , shows a difference .


Thomas Paine	PERSON	, the keenest of sceptics as well as the stanchest of patriots , and

May 27	DATE	A bird 's - eye view of history reveals no king or pope who has made the name infamous , and fails to bring to light a single great rogue
Thomas	PERSON	.

		True , a few millionaires stumbled on the name somehow , but even among these there is leaven .

		One turned traitor to his class a few years ago , and justified his literary heritage in yellow journalism de luxe .

		Some un-Thomassed person may unkindly say this praise would come more acceptably from him - self , that a Thomas should have more modesty , that he should be ashamed of such conceit , and so on .

		I am ashamed , but not of my conceit .

		The obscure author must be the reverse of '' cocky , '' for his facts are a condemnation of himself ; the more factual they are , the more condemnatory .

		This , then , is an exercise in humiliation .

		But there is a word to be said in simple justice and extenuation .

		Unlike the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, who fled his name , the writer sought it in anguish of heart , for in his youth he was called '' Percy . ''

		SOME THOUGHTS ON THE PEESENT GENEKATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Even at the risk of being called a Words - worthian , it may surely not be amiss to protest against Mr.
Hale	PERSON	's suggestion , in his article on '' The Present Generation '' in your issue of
May 13	DATE	, that
Wordsworth	PERSON	's message to us of to-day is per - haps negligible .

		The representatives of the modern movement fuse liberty and law ; with them dis - cipline becomes devotion , devotion discipline .

		But did not
Wordsworth	PERSON	say all that , and more , a century ago ?

		Where , in the writings of Kipling ,
Wells	LOCATION	, or
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, do we find anything on the subject rising to the heights of the following stanza from the '' Ode to Duty '' ? ''

		Stern Lawgiver !

		yet them dost wear The Godhead 's most benignant grace ; Nor know we anything so fair As is the smile upon thy face : Flowers laugh before thee on their beds , And fragrance in thy footing treads ; Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong ; And the most ancient heavens , through thee , are fresh and strong . ''

		The novelists and dramatists and poets of to-day are for the most part very , very solemn .

		They take both themselves and their readers far too seriously .

		Wordsworth made joy '' its own secur - ity . ''

		Though all else he has written go by the board , if that one ode contains no message for our time the misfortune is ours .

		What a boon it must have been merely to be alive in those memorable days of the year 1880 , which Mr.
Hale	PERSON	pictures so vividly , when men thought only about the mugwump movement and civil ser - vice reform !

		Our generation is so hopelessly bent on doing things and getting them done , and wreak - ing misfortunes and wrongs for the purpose of find - ing more things to do and getting them done .

		No greater calamity could befall our busy age than the discovery that the slums had been cleaned up , that wars were at an end , and that there were no longer any brothers , or nations , crying out for their souls ' keepers .

		No one now thinks of reading
Coleridge	PERSON	's '' Christabel '' through twice ; for the joy of the incomplete , the dreamy , the meaningless , is not our joy .

		We make religion practical , ignoring the splendid opportunities once afforded men for speculating on the vague , the unknowable , and the unknown .

		It grows monotonous and melancholy , this feigning that all is well .

		At the best , we are nothing but primitives plus the veneer of civiliza - tion , and why blink the fact ?

		In philosophy , too , we are pragmatists : whatever goes as a working principle , goes .

		Thales , standing on the shores of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and determining on water as the first principle of life , is one of the most poetical figures the world has ever known ; but old
Thales	ORGANIZATION	is forgotten .

		His thinking was of no use : it was something we could doubt .

		That is philosophy .

		It was Sylvester of
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, brilliant logi - cian and mathematician , lover of poetry and music , who is said to have spent months over a difficult problem , willing to forgo both food and sleep while remonstrating friends pointed out the folly of his unpractical task .

		He persisted , despite protests .

		When the problem was solved , all that he is reported to have exclaimed is , '' Thank God , it 's of no use ! ''

		And
Sylvester	PERSON	, too , is dead .

		WAE POETEY IN
GEEMANY	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		From a recent issue of the '' Protestant Weekly Letter , '' which has come to me from
Berlin	LOCATION	, I copy verbatim et punctuatim the following as of pos - sible interest to the readers of THE DIAL : '' The general uplift brought about by the war and most evident in the sphere of religious thought , finds expression also in a remarkable fact , which may be told in two lines but speaks volumes , more than many a long story : from the declaration of war until into the
late fall of 1914	DATE	about 1 ^ million new patriotic songs were written and printed ... The unnumerable unprinted poems are not included . ''

		It is impossible for me to even make an attempt in judging this enormous production of poetry as to its literary value , no one is capable of doing this , nor will any one ever be .

		The mere fact of this immense quantity may act as a guide in forming an opinion on the mental attitude of
Germany	LOCATION	's millions during this world-embracing conflict .

		Side by side with the well - known names of our national poets of the present age stand those of thousands of unknown , whose poetic vein was awakened by the unusual events of this gen - eral conflagration .

		Old and young and extremely young , men and women , farmers and business-men , ulans , artillerists and pioneers , seamen and pilots of air-craft , deaconesses , physicians , students and pupils , army generals and
University	ORGANIZATION	professors compete with politicians and men of administrative ability .

		Judg - ing this mass of literature from a purely artistic standpoint , there is no doubt that much of it is murky , although well-meant , and worthless trash ; but as a manifestation of the country 's soul , it is , taken as a whole , something stirringly great , like a huge phe - nomenon in nature .

		The most intensive mental and spiritual life of the nation can only find expression in the pathos of poetry . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 415 MISS MITFORD AS A IjETTER-AY r RITER .

		* Elegant ease and abundant leisure amid a charming rural environment , with all condi - tions favorable for an occasional exercise of her graceful pen , for pleasure only , of course , and never for pecuniary profit this , or something like it , might be the casual reader 's general impression concerning the earthly lot of her who nearly a century ago entertained an applauding public with her delightful sketches of `` Our Village . ''

		How far from the truth any such impression would be , becomes at once apparent on reviewing the main events of Miss
Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's toilsome life , and especially so in reading the recent very agreeable volume prepared by Miss
Elizabeth Lee	PERSON	and entitled , ``
Mary Russell Mitford	PERSON	: Correspondence with
Charles Boner	PERSON	and
John Ruskin	PERSON	. ''

		Newness to print can be claimed only for the
Ruskin	LOCATION	letters , which include some to
John James Ruskin	PERSON	in addition to those addressed to his more famous son ; the other letters named were made public in
1871	DATE	, in the first volume of
Rosa Mackenzie	PERSON	Kettle 's '' Memoirs and Letters of
Charles Boner	PERSON	. ''

		After cheerfully sacrificing the best of her years and far too much of her strength to the support of a father who had squandered his wife 's fortune and otherwise proved his un - worthiness of the unceasing affection and even adulation lavished upon him by that wife and that daughter ,
Miss Mitford	PERSON	was still , in the closing decade of her industrious life , in a condition to write the breezy and buoyant letters that are now , with biographical intro - duction and useful interspersed matter , pre - sented to the reader .

		For the greater part of these ten years -LRB- 1845-55 -RRB- she continued to occupy the tumble-down little cottage that had been the family home since
1820	DATE	, '' a series of closets , '' she calls it , '' the largest of which may be about eight feet square / ' But in
1851	DATE	, after pleading in vain with the landlord for necessary repairs , and when , as she writes , `` if we had stayed much longer we should have been buried in the ruins , '' she removed from
Three Mile Cross	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- for that was the name of `` Our Village '' -RRB- to the neighboring village of Swallowfield .

		It w r as a wrench , a '' heart - tug , '' to leave the old home so rich in fond associations . ''

		There I had toiled and striven , and tasted as deeply of bitter anxiety , of fear , and of hope , as often falls to the lot of woman , '' are her pathetic words . ''

		There in * MARY

McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the fulness of age , I had lost those whose love had made my home sweet and precious ... Friends , many and kind , had come to that bright garden , and that garden room .

		The list would fill more pages than I have to give .

		There Mr.
Justice Talfourd	PERSON	had brought the delightful gaiety of his brilliant youth , and poor
Haydon	PERSON	had talked more vivid pictures than he ever painted .

		The illustrious of the last century Mrs.
Opie	PERSON	,
Jane Porter	PERSON	, Mr.
Gary	PERSON	had mingled there with poets still in their earliest dawn . ''

		Charles Boner made
Miss Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's ac - quaintance in
1845	DATE	, when he was thirty years old and she nearly fifty-eight .

		He is best remembered now , perhaps , as the introducer of
Hans Andersen	PERSON	to English readers , his ver - sions of the ever-popular tales being made from the German , and one volume of these translations bearing a dedication to Miss Mit - ford , whose writings he had long admired .

		For six years in his early life Boner was tutor to the artist Constable 's two oldest sons , and he wrote the explanatory and descriptive matter accompanying '' Constable 's English Landscape , '' besides helping the painter in other ways with his pen .

		Twenty years of his life he gave to the service of Prince Thurn and Taxis at
Ratisbon	LOCATION	, as tutor to his chil - dren ; and , first and last , he made himself an intrepid mountain-climber and skilful cham - ois-hunter , as might be inferred from his book , '' Chamois Hunting in the Mountains of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, '' to which his correspondent at Swal - lowfield frequently refers .

		It was the poet
Wordsworth	PERSON	who , on receiving a visit from Boner at
Rydal Mount	ORGANIZATION	, suggested that the young man seek the acquaintance of
Miss Mitford	LOCATION	, which he was evidently very glad to do ; and that the pleasure was not all on one side is proved by the lady 's words in a letter of later date : `` Mr.
Boner	PERSON	is a most accom - plished man .

		He came to me eight or nine years ago from Mr.
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and we have been fast friends ever since . ''

		As to the
Ruskin	PERSON	friendship , to which the less bulky but perhaps not less valuable por - tion of the letters now presented is due , it began long before the two correspondents met in
1847	DATE	.

		That Miss Mitford was highly pleased with the man from the very first of her acquaintance with his person , in
January	DATE	of that year , need surprise no one familiar with the many published tributes to
Ruskin	PERSON	's ingratiating manner and abiding charm .


Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	wrote of him long after Miss Mitford 's time , '' He still remains one of the most interesting men in the \ vorld . ''

		She herself , soon after meeting him , wrote to a friend : '' Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was here last week , and 416 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	is certainly the most charming person that I have ever known ... He is just what if one had a son one should have dreamt of his turn - ing out , in mind , manner , conversation , every - thing . ''

		Eleven of her letters to the son and two to the father have escaped the ravages of time , and are included in the volume .

		Recur - rent in
Miss Mitford	LOCATION	's letters are the names of such celebrities of her time , and more often than not of her personal acquaintance , as the Brownings ,
Miss Martineau	PERSON	,
Henry Chorley	PERSON	,
Dean Milman	PERSON	,
James T. Fields	PERSON	,
George Tick	PERSON	- nor ,
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	,
Bishop Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	, Mr. and Mrs.
Cobden	PERSON	,
Joanna Baillie	PERSON	,
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	, Mrs.
Somerville	LOCATION	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and many others ; so that her correspondence constitutes a sort of early Victorian picture gallery of notables and their manners and customs .

		Miss Mitford is not new to the world as a letter - writer , since
Chorley	PERSON	's edition of `` Let - ters of
Mary Russell Mitford	PERSON	, '' in two vol - umes , has been accessible to readers for more than forty years , and
L'Estrange	PERSON	's biography of her , in three volumes , contains many of her letters , as does also his later work , '' The Friendships of
Mary Russell Mitford	PERSON	. ''

		Nev - ertheless it is well to have these characteristic utterances of her later years brought together in convenient and attractive form .

		They show her at her ripest and best as a letter - writer , and though they can not be expected to raise her .

		to the rank of a
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	in this department of polite literature , they establish her position , if it be not already fixed , in the company of those friendly and , in no malicious sense , gossipy , and wholly pleasing and entertaining correspondents of whom
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	and his friend
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	are among the best examples .

		Of
Miss Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's manner in letter - writing she herself has something significant to say in one of her last communications to Boner , wherein she alludes to her fondness for epis - tolary unrestraint , but seems to credit herself with rather more of formality in her copious letters to her `` friend abroad '' than is actu - ally discoverable in them , though they are less impulsive than those to
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		She says : '' Mrs.
Browning 1	PERSON	, to whom at one time -LRB- that is to say , for many years -RRB- I used to write two or three times a week , always preferred those letters , written in a far more complete abandonment than anything I should do in the way of autobiography , to any of my writings .

		Professor
Tom Taylor	PERSON	meant -LRB- from the same impression -RRB- to have inserted all I would have permitted of my letters in Hay - don 's correspondence , and
John Ruskin	PERSON	, to whom I also write with the same laisser aller , professes the same opinion .

		You , to whom I have chiefly written as a sort of English correspondent to a friend abroad , can hardly , perhaps , judge of these frequent and habitual epistles where the pen plays any pranks it chooses . ''

		More than once
Miss Mitford	ORGANIZATION	makes it plain that she heartily dislikes '' the trade of author - ship , '' however willingly she may receive the substantial returns that successful writing brings to her not over-plethoric purse .

		What she thoroughly enjoyed was gardening and social intercourse and hours of uninterrupted reading in the best authors , preferably French , of her own or a little earlier day .

		In the single month of
January , 1806	DATE	, she ap - pears to have run through fifty-five volumes , and her speed as a reader must have increased with the maturing of her powers .

		One of her earlier letters to Boner reveals her lack of enthusiasm for the production of books for others to read .

		This is the vein in which she writes , with considerable untruth as to the number of her literary friends and acquain - tances : '' I have to thank you for your most kind letter , and for your verses , which are full of power ; and now you must summon all your indulgence and all your faith in the sincerity of my esteem and my goodwill , and allow me to entreat you to find some better literary agent than my poor self .

		I live in the country , going rarely , if ever , to
London	LOCATION	, and then to one house only .

		I have as few literary friends and acquaintances as is well possible , and of the race of Editors and Journalists I know abso - lutely nothing .

		Then if I write to proprietors of magazines , or newspapers , or periodicals of any sort , requesting them to insert a friend 's poem , the reply is sure to be that they overflow with poetry , but that they want a prose story from me , and most likely they trump up a story of some pre - vious application , and dun with as much authority as if I really owed them the article , and they had paid for it .

		Now all this is not only supremely disagreeable to me , but makes me a most ineffective and useless mediator for you .

		You should have a man upon the spot for those things , and not an old woman at a distance , hating the trade of authorship , and keeping as much aloof as possible from all its tracasseries '' One extract from the
Ruskin	PERSON	correspon - dence must now be given , and it will show the intimacy , the warmth of affection , and the height of admiration , with which she was wont to address him . ''

		If I love you all father , mother , and son so much better than I seem to have a right to do , calculating only our personal intercourse , and that only with one , remember , dear friends , that it is your own fault .

		Recollect that for a dozen years or more there has been no benefit so large that you have not conferred it no attention so little as to be omitted by either .

		Then to say nothing of books fuller of high and noble thoughts than any that have appeared since the great age of English thinkers over which
Milton	PERSON	and
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 417 shed their light , and to which
Cowley	PERSON	and
Izaak Walton	PERSON	lent their sweetness , I have received from both father and son such letters as could only be written by men whose minds and whose lives were filled with kindness and purity and holiness .

		Yes !

		I have all the right to love you that such knowledge and an ardent gratitude can give and you will pardon an intrusion that springs from such a source . ''

		More of the heart than of the head do we have in such letters as this to
Ruskin	LOCATION	; but both the heart and the head are shown , in the letters as a whole , to be those of a noble and loving woman , a woman unusually endowed both mentally and morally , and one worthy of the wide circle of distinguished friends who delighted to respond to an invitation to the little cottage at
Three Mile Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		The col - lection of letters telling so pleasantly and informally the story of the writer 's closing years , and appropriately illustrated with por - traits and views , is a notable contribution to - early Victorian literary history .

		THE EPIC or FREXCH EXPLORATION ix
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* It is seldom that there appears a book on just the plan and with the distinctive char - acter of Mr.
John Finley	PERSON	's '' The French in the Heart of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In this country we are not now given to the production of histori - cal w r orks pitched in a key of high eloquence , and persistently maintained at that pitch .

		The Parkmans and the Bancrofts yield place to the
McMasters	ORGANIZATION	and the Schoulers ; oratori - cal passion surrenders to impassive literal exactitude .

		But in the case of the present work , we have a distinct reversion to the older type : Mr.
Finley	PERSON	confessedly takes for his model the `` Homeric Parkman . ''

		The '' Epilogue '' to this book is actually an essay on ``
Francis Parkman	PERSON	: The Historian of
France	LOCATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	. ''

		The first quality of Mr.
Finley	PERSON	's work , then , is the quality of spoken eloquence , the subtle factitiousness which somehow seems to inhere in the production designed primarily to be heard , rather than read .

		It must , however , be pointed out that the eloquence here is not the eloquence of
Parkman	LOCATION	; it is really the elo - quence of
Finley	ORGANIZATION	.

Rennes	LOCATION	, and Caen . ''

		Despite the strain which comes from listening to one who habitually speaks in oratorical tones , one feels that the first half of this book is best treated that way ; the last half suffers disproportion - ately .

		It is not history that the author writes : he has little sense for real continuity and minor detail , the massing of which is so often indispensable for the creation of true historical perspective .

		He paints with a brush of massive dimensions ; the canvas he covers with heroic figures , having length but little breadth or depth .

		Two qualities , deserving of singular commendation , in this impressionistic personal journal , are these : the author 's individual passion for sensing origins through personal examination at the source ; and his constitu - tional devotion to the world of out-of-doors and the sport of exercise , which has carried him , on foot , over the grand routes of the French explorers , the sinuous courses of the forgotten portages , the hidden trails of the extinct coureurs de bois .

		After giving us , with bright tint and broad stroke , the historical background of the labors of those gallant and persevering Frenchmen , and a suggestion of the permanent survivors of that once dominant civilization , the au - thor has attempted the difficult task of show - ing the birth , grow r th , and development of present-day
America	LOCATION	out of that past , and moulded by it .

		The subject , we realize , is epic ; and , true poet in instinct , the author has given it nothing less than the epic treat - ment , We feel it to be epic , vast as the vivid pictures pass us in brilliant array : Jacques Cartier in the dim middle vast of the continent ;
Champlain	LOCATION	, at
Quebec	LOCATION	, heroically struggling for the permanence of his foothold ; the pious
Maisonneuve	PERSON	at
Montreal	LOCATION	; the
Chris	PERSON	- tian spirits of Le
Caron	PERSON	,
Brebeuf	PERSON	, and Gamier , suffering peril , hardship , torture , and death , that the heathen may know God ; the winning of
Marquette	LOCATION	to the '' Great Water '' ; and the ultimate triumph of La Salle .

		The tone of the book may be caught in the following character - istic passage : `` And , seeing and hearing all this again , we have seen a land as large as all
Europe	LOCATION	emerge from the unknown at the evocation of pioneers of
France	LOCATION	, who stood all , or nearly all , sooner or later within three or four kilometres of the very place in which I sit writing these words .

		The indifference to exactitude which the book seems to betray is particularly marked in the case of Mr.
Finley	PERSON	's allusions to the ex - plorer whose name he bears .

		As if it were unimpeachable , he quotes the following pas - sage from '' The Western World '' : '' That delightful country -LSB-
Kentucky	LOCATION	-RSB- from time immemorial had been the resort of wild beasts and of men only less savage , when in the year
1767	DATE	it was visited by
John Finley	PERSON	and a few wandering white men from the British colony of
North Caro	LOCATION	- lina , allured by the love of hunting and the desire of barter with the Indians .

		The distance of this country from populous parts of the colonies , almost continuous wars , and the claims of the French had prevented all attempts at exploration . ''

		The author says that '' he seized upon this '' ; but care for accuracy might w r ell have re - strained him from being so precipitate .


John Finley	PERSON	, the explorer , visited
Kentucky	LOCATION	as early as
1752	DATE	, despite the figure given by the untrust - worthy and fanciful
Filson	PERSON	.

		On this visit he was assuredly not accompanied by `` wander - ing white men from the British colony of
North Carolina	LOCATION	. ''

		There is documentary evidence to show that
John Finley	PERSON	sailed down the
Ohio	LOCATION	, and later , no doubt , the
Mississippi	LOCATION	; but we have no means of knowing where he stopped .

		It is highly probable that he stopped in the land visited fifteen years before , especially in view of the fact that only
two years later	DATE	he was piloting his comrade-in-arms of the
Brad	PERSON	- dock campaign ,
Daniel Boone	PERSON	, from the valley of the Yadkin -LRB-
Holman 's Ford	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- through Cum - berland Gap to the heart of
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		It was on this trip , in
1769	DATE	, that
Finley	PERSON	was accom - panied by '' a few wandering white men from the British colony of
North Carolina	LOCATION	. ''

		These white men , five of them , with
Finley	PERSON	as guide making the sixth , were not mere purposeless wanderers into a trackless wilderness .

		They w r ere sent on their journey of exploration by Colonel
Richard Henderson	PERSON	, colonial judge , in behalf of the famous land company afterwards entitled the
Transylvania Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The absence of illustrations is a source of great regret .

HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		WILLIAM II .

		OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		*
Ernest Renan	PERSON	a short time before his death expressed regret that he should not live to see the unfolding of the multiform personality of
William II.	PERSON	, then the '' young
Kaiser	PERSON	. ''

		In the
last quarter	DATE	of a century we have been privi - leged to behold what Renan has missed .

		Con - sidered as a spectacle of life it has been worth while .

		Emperor
William	PERSON	has been the most influential , the most discussed , and in some ways the most interesting character in the world .

		This interest is of course due in great part to his position , but it is also to a consid - erable extent inherent in his personality .

		Until the record is closed any judgment passed upon him must necessarily be provisional .

		As matters stand no \ v , consistency is the last quality that can be attributed to him .

		There are contradictions in his character and career that can not be resolved , high seriousness of purpose coupled w r ith vanity and almost child - ish love of show , atavistic assertion of divine rights joined to a twentieth century modernity , the attitudes of a war-lord glorying in the `` mailed fist '' and `` shining armor '' -LRB- his own phrases -RRB- along with the pose of the sovereign `` who kept the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The one thing which may be asserted of him without qualification is that he has always developed his restless activity in the public gaze .

		Unlike his royal cousin ,
George	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	, he is a monarch in love with his job .

		His speeches , of which he has delivered upwards of a thou - sand , for the most part on military occasions , are in themselves evidence enough of his superabundant vitality and his determination to assert his own views , while the clear , terse , and at times eloquent style of these utter - ances testifies to an awakened intelligence and a sense of form , whatever one 's verdict on the substance may be .

		Any attempt to read the riddle of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's character without some historical guide is bound to be hopeless .

		As evidence we may take the little volume , '' My Ideas and Ideals , '' in which several hundred utterances of the
Kaiser	PERSON	are juxtaposed roughly accord - ing to subject , but without context or explana - tion and apparently also without chronological order .

		The result is simply bewildering , and leads nowhere .

Princeton	LOCATION	, on the other hand , has performed a useful service by arranging some of the most striking speeches under various headings , and by giving the setting and the necessary his - torical background in each case .

		It is possible by means of his book to follow certain lines of the imperial policy with fairly satisfactory clearness .

		The compiler 's attitude , it should be added , seems to be thoroughly neutral .

		The handsome book entitled '' The Kaiser '' by Mr.
Asa Don Dickinson	PERSON	contains numerous illustrations , and the text , though of a sketchy nature , is interspersed with much shrewd comment .

		A few slight mistakes should be corrected in another edition : the date of the founding of German
South West Africa	LOCATION	is wrongly given -LRB- p. 68 -RRB- , the '' Daily Telegraph '' interview appears as the '' Daily Mail '' inter - view -LRB- p. 52 -RRB- , and the ``
November	DATE	storm '' is stated as occurring in
1909	DATE	instead of
1908	DATE	-LRB- p. 161 -RRB- .

		The personal character of the Emperor as it is revealed in his domestic life is sympa - thetically described in '' Memories of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's Court '' by Miss
Anne Topham	PERSON	, who was for some years English governess to the Princess
Victoria Louise	PERSON	.

		Though her sprightly , gossipy book is mainly devoted to the general life of the court , it gives many entertaining glimpses of the Emperor as he appears in his intimate circle , frank , gen - erous , open-hearted , and with a love of raillery if not a genuine sense of humor .

		It is also an ultra-masculine figure , after the German fash - ion , that is shown here .

		The following obser - vation of the author deserves to be quoted because it discloses something characteristic : '' He can explain everything to everybody ; but there is one exception the suffragettes .

		He has never been able to explain them .

		They baffle him entirely .

		At first he thought they were just disap - pointed spinsters , but in view of the number of married women in their ranks he was obliged to abandon this idea .

		Since then he has been groping in vain after a satisfactory solution ... It is of no use to explain to His Majesty the difference between militant and non-militant suffragists ... ' Women should stay at home and look after their children , ' is his last word on the subject . ''

		But indeed , as Miss
Topham	PERSON	remarks , the Emperor has for English politics as apart from English life , which he loves a per - plexed and irritated wonderment and con - tempt .

		The ablest discussion of the Emperor 's poli - cies and the results they have achieved is to be found in the volume by Dr.
Stanley Shaw of Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		This short book was written before the war , and can certainly not be accused of an unfavorable bias .

		Unfor - tunately a new chapter `` by another hand , '' which has been added since the outbreak of hostilities , is much inferior in both ability and temper .

		Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	has built his book mainly out of the recorded deeds and utterances of
William II.	PERSON	, but he has buttressed it liberally from the memoirs of
Bismarck	LOCATION	,
Hohenlohe	PERSON	, and Billow .

		Doubtless the historian of the future will have to use much further mate - rial ; for the present these sources must suffice .

		In order to explain the persistent enigma of the Emperor 's personality and career , must we have recourse to the rather desperate hypothesis of paranoia , or of some kindred mental derangement ?

		Some alienists have pointed out as evidence his over-weening self - esteem , his belief in his divine mission , his impulsiveness and incalculability , noting at the same time that certain physical stigmata are not lacking .

		That is also the burden of a recent poem by
Verhaeren	PERSON	, who sees in the devastation of
Belgium	LOCATION	the work of a madman .

		Let us attempt a simpler and more natural explanation .

		Much will be made clear if we assume that the
Kaiser	PERSON	is com - pounded of two natures , one modern and materialistic , the other mediaeval and idealis - tic .

		William II .

		is modern only as far as the external world and the things of the senses are concerned .

		As a child of his time he has appreciated from the outset the fact that he is cast in an age of commerce and industry , of rapid transit and invention .

		He has gloried in the marvellous expansion of
Germany	LOCATION	's trade , in her triumphant industrial progress , in the formidable growth of army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the
William	PERSON	who has practised
Macht	PERSON	- politik , cultivated the Krupps , and extolled Count Zeppelin as the greatest German of the twentieth century .

		But in the things of the intellect and the spirit , in ideas and ideals , he is faithful to his inheritance , and remains a romanticist and even a medievalist .

		This is pre-eminently true of his religion , the sincerity of which seems beyond cavil .

		He looks upon himself almost as a high priest ; the name of God is constantly upon his lips , recently , because of the incongruous circumstances , to a positively offensive degree .

		But his God is `` our great Ally , '' a German tribal deity , a sort of magnified and non-natural
Hohenzol	PERSON	- lern .

		Of that modern Christianity which finds its highest expression in the Sermon on the Mount he has little appreciation , even though in a memorable speech he has referred to Jesus as `` the most personal of all personali - ties . ''

		As in religion , so too in politics he has missed the spirit of the age , and his total failure even to comprehend the meaning of democracy will , unless the wheel of time is somehow miraculously reversed , indubitably 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	wreck his ultimate reputation as a statesman .

		The claim to divine right , which was for a time regarded as an exuberant touch of youth - ful rhetoric , was unequivocally repeated at
Konigsberg	ORGANIZATION	in
1910	DATE	, and , according to current reports , was even more glaringly asserted at the outbreak of the present war .

		All this is not to say that he has been without solicitude for the common people .

		But he has never ad - vanced a particle beyond the paternalistic conception of a government from the top down , handing out favors with disciplinary care to a docile and unambitious proletariat .

		`` Leave the Socialists to me , '' he said to
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck very early in his reign , and attempted to win them by kindly admonitions .

		When they refused to respond to blandishments , he became exasperated and denounced them as traitors and enemies of religion .

		The result of this mingling of conciliation and abuse has been the growth of the Social-Democratic vote to the portentous total of four and a quarter millions .

		A similar lack of understanding has marked the imperial treatment of Alsatians and Poles in their struggle for autonomy .

		That aspiration for liberty which is so irre - pressible in the modern breast finds but scant recognition in the constitution of
Germany	LOCATION	, and none at all from `` William II .

		In like manner he has failed to appreciate the modern spirit in literature and the arts .

		Writers like
Ganghofer	PERSON	and the egregious Lauff have been taken to his bosom , while
Hauptmann	PERSON	has been neglected or snubbed .

		The mortuary Siegesallee in
Berlin	LOCATION	represents what his patronage of sculpture has evoked .

		Since the
Kaiser	PERSON	dropped the old pilot in
1890	DATE	, he has virtually been his own chancellor .

		The government has followed the lines of policy laid down by him .

		At most a more forceful chancellor like Billow ventured once or twice to check his imperial master , but gen - erally his ministers have been as acquiescent as the dull and pedantic Bethmann-Hollweg .

		It may be profitable to inquire for a moment whither the `` new course '' has led
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Bismarck 's policy had been purely continental , and had aimed at making
Germany	LOCATION	secure and dominant in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The policy of
Germany	LOCATION	under the
Kaiser	PERSON	's personal rule has been , briefly , to establish a new world-power .

		Viewed from almost any angle , the result is not brilliant .

		It is an unescapable fact that whereas in
1890	DATE	Germany had only one enemy in
Europe France	LOCATION	, in
July of 1914	DATE	she could count upon only one sure friend
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Beyond a doubt , indiscretions like the
Kruger	PERSON	telegram and hob-nailed diplomacy such as precipitated the two
Morocco	LOCATION	crises account - for much of this estrangement .

		But the out - come was really almost inevitable .

		It is Ger - many 's tragedy to have entered late into the race for empire and to have found the earth pre-empted .

		The alternative to reaching out and running foul of her neighbors would have been to cultivate contentment at home .

		Which was the part of wisdom ?

		In view of the pres - ent cataclysm , from which
Germany	LOCATION	can at best only emerge with even honors , the answer is scarcely doubtful .

		There remains the most interesting question of all .

		The
Kaiser	PERSON	won the admiration of the pacifists because of the indisputable fact that for twenty-six years he kept the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	, often against strong pressure from within , and frequently proclaimed that to be his unswerving aim .

		But , up to the
summer of 1914	DATE	, did the net influence of
William II	PERSON	.

		make for peace or war ?

		It is here , as Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	points out , that the small cool voice of common-sense reasserts itself .

		During those years the
Kaiser	PERSON	was sponsor for the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, he was supreme representative of the army , in whose uniforms he almost invariably appeared and whose dominance within
Germany	LOCATION	he con - stantly maintained ; he was the author of the most famous winged words of militarism , and the living embodiment of the doctrine si vis pacem , para bellum , the sophistry of which now seems manifest to everybody .

		Such is the Hohenzollern tradition ; the fighting spirit was in his blood , even though for prudential reasons he long refrained from war .

		When we come to the present crisis , matters appear even worse .

		The issue of
Europe	LOCATION	's peace or war lay in his hands last
July	DATE	, and deliber - ately or reluctantly he chose war .

		A hint from him would have restrained his Austrian ally , a nod would have brought about the con - ference which Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	suggested , and he could have had it virtually on his own conditions of time and place , and hence with - out loss of dignity .

		Taking advantage of a favorable international conjuncture , he in - sisted upon pushing through his Balkan pro- gramme at all hazards ; and so precipitately did his government press matters , so heedless was it of ordinary diplomatic manceuvering , that it can not now even make a decent pre - tence of having tried to avoid war .

		It may be , as Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, Dr.
David Starr Jor	PERSON	- dan , and other pacifists have surmised , that when the
Kaiser	PERSON	returned from
Norway	LOCATION
last July	DATE	matters had already got almost beyond control and that in the end his hand was vir - tually forced by the military clique .

		Or it may be that he himself had gradually been won over to the view that war was inevitable and now realized that the opportune moment for
Germany	LOCATION	had finally come .

		This is the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 421 view elaborated in the French Yellow Papers , and recently reaffirmed by Lord
Haldane	PERSON	.

		Proof is lacking at present , but some color of plausibility is lent by such considerations as the popular resentment in
Germany	LOCATION	against the government for its humiliating backdown in
1911	DATE	, the taunts of the nationalistic press , the stings of that gadfly among German jour - nalists ,
Maximilian Harden	PERSON	, and most of all the ever-present pressure from the chiefs of the
General Staff	ORGANIZATION	by whom the
Kaiser	PERSON	is con - stantly surrounded .

		But in either case the difference of responsibility is only one of degree .

		William II .

		will go down in history as the aggressor in the greatest war the world has ever seen .

		Yet , barring a supreme disas - ter , it is hardly likely that he will have many pangs of remorse .

		A chronic optimist by temperament , panoplied in his sense of divine guidance , he has always been proof against self-reproach .

		Scapegoats will be found , there are signs already that certain men are predestined victims .

		Chastened in mood the Emperor may be , and probably the soul - solitude brought by advancing years will in - crease upon him greatly ; but , unless he forgoes his nature utterly , he will to the end manifest his tireless activity , ever ready , in the words of one of his favorite poems , '' to fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds ' work of distance run . ''

		THE COSMIC SOUL .

		* Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's book on the
Cosmic Relations	ORGANIZATION	is an attempt to justify the ways of '' spirits '' to men .

		The author is , however , under no illu - sion as to the weight of his evidence , or as to the probability-coefficient attaching to his hypothesis of a Cosmic Soul . ''

		I can not envy the man , '' he insists , '' who can write on these vague subjects without painfully mistrusting himself . ''

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's method of presentation has left him , he assures us , `` absolutely un - trammeled by any theory , except what has grown up during the work itself . ''

		Hence he claims for his results no finality .

		`` Many of the facts presented are very nebulous , and the guesses are naturally more nebulous still . ''

		His hypothesis '' admits no affiliation with the famous masses of guesswork which announce themselves as established truth . ''

		Conse - quently , '' I do n't propose to go to the stake for it , or send anybody else for denying it . ''

		What , then , are the facts which necessitate so apologetically expounded an hypothesis , and * ON THE COSMIC RELATIONS .

		By
Henry Holt	PERSON	.

		In two vol - umes .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Hourhton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		what is that hypothesis ?

		The facts are a mass of reports on '' psychic phenomena '' : telepa - thy , dreams , levitation , controls , spirits , me - diums and the inevitable and indefatigable Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	.

		Under the challenging captions of '' telekinesis , '' '' autokinesis , '' '' psychokine - sis , '' and '' telepsychosis , '' Mr.
Holt	PERSON	presents an array of data discouraging in its minuteness .

		If the 750 pages of '' evidence '' are meant to convince , compression as well as suppression would have served our author 's purpose much more efficaciously .

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, to be sure , is convinced con - vinced of Immortality and of a Cosmic Soul .

		He invites us to examine '' a vast mass of pro- foundly interesting phenomena .

		.

		which can - not be accounted for by any form of telepathy or any cause justified by experience .

		On the surface , the phenomena are ostensibly caused by human intelligences surviving death .

		Re - ject that cause , '' we are disconsolately warned , '' and -LRB- pace Drs.
Tanner	PERSON	and Hall -RRB- there is no other in sight . ''

		The '' whole thing , '' further - more , '' readily comes under the hypothesis of the Cosmic Soul of ideas and impressions of all sorts floating about the universe picked up in all sorts of ways and in all sorts of com - binations , and remodeled into all sorts of new combinations . ''

		We must , accordingly , posit `` back of all phenomena the Cosmic Soul , which is sometimes called God , which gener - ates and includes and manifests and inter - communicates all personalities that are , or have been , or are to be , and which , with them , dies not . ''

		Thus Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, scientist of the Metapsychical .

		When we turn , however , from Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's science to his comments and annotations which punctuate the multifold array of '' facts , '' to his gentle humor and still gentler skepticism , to his light humanistic by-the-ways on general ethics , sex-morality , and happiness , inter - spersed with delightful gibes at current con - vention , not excluding his chatty and personal hints for a latter-day '' mediumistically '' dem - onstrated Theodicy , we are inclined to the belief that we shall discover the major value of the book not in its elucidation of one more hypothetical Universal All-including Soul , not in its pathetic albeit manfully sustained desire to establish the
Newer Immortality	ORGANIZATION	, but rather in its human , supremely human , quality of `` Apologia pro Optimismo Meo . ''

		Optimism romantic , mystic , rhapsodic alternates irrepressibly with pagefuls of argu - mentation . ''

		I can not remember , '' writes Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, '' when I did not have the rudiments -LSB- of the Cosmic Consciousness -RSB- before great scenery and great music , and it culminated in me ten years before the usual period ... It came with t 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 2	DATE	' the blaze of light , but the light was from the natural sunset . ''

		And to Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, poet of the Cosmic Relations , '' the powers of mystery are lovely as well as awful .

		The mists and moun - tains and dark shadows opposite me as I write , are both .

		I do not read their meaning , as I read the meaning of a 2 - f - 2ab - -LRB- - b 2 , but they lift and expand and deepen the soul as do no meanings that I can read ; and while they raise the most terrible questions , they answer them with : ' Peace !

		Wait !

		Work !

		Earn the rest that you feel is in Us !

		All will be well ! ' ' ''

		Perchance , '' concedes the less romantic reader , '' all will be well .

		Yes , 't is very pretty rhapsody , but is it science ? ''

		And this same matter-of-fact reader , deeply appreciative as he is of the utter lack of dogmatism on the part of the author in the exposition of his ten - tative hypothesis , fully recognizing the spirit not only of caution but even of skepticism pervading the work , is still haunted by a sus - picion , even a conviction , that not all is well if not demonstrably with the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	, at least with the scientific procedure of Mr.
Holt	PERSON	.

		`` On seeing the MS. -LRB- or rather TS . -RRB-

		of this chapter , '' Mr.
Holt	PERSON	confidingly relates , `` my friend .

		.

		asks whether .

		.

		I do not , in treat - ing them -LSB- certain controls -RSB- in a spirit of lev - ity , show less confidence in the .

		.

		controls than I really feel .

		I wish somebody would tell me how much I really feel .

		And if he tells me on
Sunday	DATE	, I wish he would tell me again at the end of the week .

		Sometimes I feel a good deal , and sometimes I do n't . ''

		This sounds perilously near to
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's apocryphal little speech to his God : '' Entre nous , je crois que vous n'existez pas . ''

		Of the precariousness of his position , Mr.
Holt	PERSON	is all too well aware ; his insistence on the plausibility of his solution of the problems of spiritism and immortality is politeness itself .

		Lest , however , his scientific humility should seem to overreach itself , he is ever ready with a corrective an attenuated mysticism ; nor is a tinge of satire wanting .

		`` We , in our immeasurable wisdom , do n't see how it -LSB- immor - tality -RSB- can work we do n't see how a universe that we do n't begin to know , which already has genius and beauty and love , and which seems to like to give us all it can birds , flowers , sunsets , stars ,
Vermont	LOCATION	, the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, and Grand Canyon ; which , most of all , has given us the insatiable soul , can manage to give us immortality .

		Well !

		Perhaps we ought not to be grasping ought to call all we know and have , enough , and be thankful . ''

		A scientist , however , who is so magnani - mously hesitant about his science will surely not fail , when hard pressed , to be equally non - belligerent about his romantic Universe and Cosmic Soul .

		For , is it not written by Mr.
Holt	PERSON	himself : '' If in solitude .

		.

		anywhere under the stars , you have not already felt that conception , you will probably find my efforts wasted '' ?


HENRY M. SHEFFER	PERSON	.

		THE NEW SPIRIT ix SOUTHERN HISTORICAL , WRITING .

		* Of the fifteen essays contained in the
Dun	ORGANIZATION	- ning testimonial volume of '' Studies in
South	LOCATION	- ern History and Politics '' all but two or three have for their subjects some phase of the Civil War and
Reconstruction Period	ORGANIZATION	and the race question .

		This is natural , since most of the authors are of southern birth , and nearly every southern historian is primarily inter - ested in the Civil War and the questions which came into being as a result of it .

		The general editor of the volume is Profes - sor
J. W. Garner	PERSON	of the
Department of Politi	ORGANIZATION	-
cal Science	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is also the author of the concluding essay , '' .

		Southern Politics since the Civil War . ''

		Pro- fessor
Garner	PERSON	's main thesis in this essay is that the agitation of the negro question by political demagogues in the South has been of infinite harm to both races , and hence ought to come to an end .

		In fact , he is optimistic enough to believe that such agitation is now nearing its close , as the southern people are becoming heartily tired of it .

		Though one may well agree with this opinion , and hope that the elimination of the race question from southern politics is near at hand , there are those who by no means agree with Professor
Garner	PERSON	in thinking that the resulting two-party system is essential to the normal and successful func - tioning of popular government , and that its absence tends to render the political life of a community stagnant and lacking in vitality .

		Undoubtedly the South has a number of things the matter with it , but certainly the absence of the two-party system is not one of them .

		The two most interesting essays in the vol - ume are those written by Professors
Holland Thompson	PERSON	, of the College of the City of
New York	LOCATION	, and
William K. Boyd	PERSON	, of Trinity Col - lege ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		In a sane , unemotional , and scholarly way these two essays deal re - spectively with '' The New South , Economic and Social '' and '' Some Phases of Educational History in the South since
1865	DATE	. ''

		In a concise but entirely illuminating manner , Professors
Thompson	PERSON	and
Boyd	PERSON	analyze the various fac - tors that have helped or hindered the progress * STUDIES IN SOUTHERN HISTORY AND POLITICS .

New York	LOCATION	:
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 423 of the South along economic or educational lines .

		It is indeed refreshing to find at least two young southerners of undoubted talent and ability breaking away from the idea that everything of historical importance in their section concerns itself with the problems aris - ing out of slavery and its overthrow , and devoting themselves to matters of greater pres - ent-day importance .

		In saying this the re - viewer does not mean to disparage the other essays in the volume .

		It is certainly important and indeed necessary , both for the South and for the North , that the history of slavery and the Civil War should be rewritten by southern - ers trained in historical research as the authors of these essays have been trained .

		They have approached their subjects not as partisan southerners whose purpose it was to vindicate or defend , but rather with sympathy purged of bias and sectionalism ; and in this spirit they have all succeeded in adding something of real scholarship to the body of southern his - torical literature .

		In the opening essay , on '' Deportation and Colonization : An Attempted Solution of the Race Problem , '' Professor
W. L. Fleming	PERSON	of
Louisiana State University	ORGANIZATION	shows that though such a solution of the race problem has been advocated by people as prominent as
Jefferson	PERSON	and Lincoln and a great many others since
1770	DATE	, the scheme has never had any sort of chance to succeed , due mainly to the opposition of white employers of negro labor .

		Undoubt - edly there is a great deal of truth in Professor
Fleming	PERSON	's witty remark that '' every white man would be glad to have the entire black race deported except his own laborers . ''

		In '' The Literary Movement for Secession , '' Professor
Ulrich B. Phillips	PERSON	of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	maintains the thesis that `` state rights , while often harped upon , were in the main not an object of devotion for their own sake ; but as a means of securing southern rights .

		State sovereignty was used to give the insignia of legality to a stroke for national independence . ''

		Professor
Phillips	PERSON	arrives at this conclusion from an exhaustive study of the southern pamphlet literature written dur - ing the ten or twelve years preceding secession , and thereby proves to be a fact what was often suspected as having been the case .

		Professor
J. G. de R. Hamilton	PERSON	of
North Carolina University	ORGANIZATION	, in ''
Southern Legislation	ORGANIZATION	in Respect to Freedmen , 1865-1866 , '' states comprehensively and fairly for the first time the essence of all the southern '' black codes , '' which , either from ignorance or crass partisan - ship , have been very much misrepresented and misunderstood .

		From the southern point of view , but with no attempt to excuse or extenu - ate obviously unjust and unnecessary restric - tions on the liberties of the negroes , Professor
Hamilton	PERSON	shows that the legislation in respect to f reedmen during the two years following the close of the war was on the whole a sincere , and for the most part , an intelligent attempt to fix the legal and economic status of the four mil - lion ex-slaves , who from the very nature of the case were destined to continue for a time at least in a position of actual inferiority to the great body of white people about them .

		In conclusion , Professor
Hamilton	PERSON	expresses the opinion that
Blaine	PERSON	, in his '' Twenty Years of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' and many other writers have either wilfully or ignorantly misrepresented the facts in giving as a reason for the radical recon - struction policy the prior enactment of the `` black codes . ''

		He thinks that the radical policy had been determined upon before the '' black codes '' were passed , and consequently its shape was not much affected by these codes .

		However , by misrepresenting the codes and distorting them before the public as a rebel attempt to reenslave the negroes , the Radicals were thereby enabled to make a great deal of use of them in securing the success of their policy .

		*
Miss Ethel Dell	PERSON	, in `` The Keeper of the Door , '' once more brings us into the compan - ionship of
Nick Ratcliffe	PERSON	, whose Indian ex - ploits and rocky road of love held us breathless in '' The Way of an Eagle . ''

		He is now living in
England	LOCATION	, a
Member of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, held in immense respect for his Indian record .

		The position of hero in the new story is not , how - ever , reserved for him , but is given to
Max Wyndham	PERSON	, a young physician , to whom many of his characteristics are transferred , while his niece and pal ,
Olga Ratcliffe	PERSON	, provides the book with an adorable heroine .

		The story is a very long one made so by the wilderness of small talk which exasperatingly clogs its action and it is a long time before the narrative gets anywhere .

		About midway , the scene shifts from
England	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	, where it remains almost until the end , and where some exciting things happen .

		Nick is sent by the govern - ment to look after the affairs of a rebellious native state , and
Olga	PERSON	goes with him .

		Still , the interest even there is one of personal psy - chology rather than of objective incident , al - though there is one episode of a tiger and another of a bomb .

		Max Wyndham is `` the keeper of the door '' in a symbolical sense ; that is , as a physician he has the power of life and death in his hands , and possesses the secret of a mysterious and potent drug referred to as '' the pain-killer , '' which figures in the plot in a very critical way .

		Overwrought with grief for a girl-friend threatened with a hideous form of insanity ,
Olga	PERSON	gives her the relief which is death by an overdose of this medicine , and then falls into a delirious illness which obliterates from her mind all recollection of what has happened .

		Later , malicious tongues persuade her that her friend 's life has been lost through the unprofessional conduct of Max , whereupon she breaks off her engage - ment with him .

		The truth is revealed to her when she revisits the scene of the girl 's death , and the gap in her memory is suddenly re - paired .

		It is Max who triumphs in the end , although
Olga	PERSON	has meanwhile given her heart to his very engaging brother
Noel	PERSON	, whose suf - ferings in her service and eventual disappoint - ment in her loss make a heavy draft upon our sympathies .

		The novel has an overplus of sentiment , and is spun out to much too great a length , but its interest is cumulative , and it * THE KEEPER OF THE DOOR .

		grows more tense and exciting with every added chapter .

		A really ingenious detective story , which does not stretch the long arm of coincidence to a freakish length , and which does not contrive difficulties obviously insurmountable except by impossible devices , offers one of the best forms of entertainment .

		Such a story , supported by crisp telling and swift dramatic action , is found in Mr.
Arthur Stringer	PERSON	's '' The Hand of Peril . ''

		It tells of the tracking of a gang of counterfeiters and forgers to their secret quar - ters in
Paris	LOCATION	,
Palermo	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	, with their final discomfiture at the hands of a secret service agent of the federal government .

		The extraordinary success of these rascals is due to the fine artistic faculty of a young woman , whom they have trained from her youth as an expert with the brush , the pen , and the engraving needle .

		Her forged docu - ments and her plates are so carefully executed that they deceive all but the best qualified of experts , and constitute a grave international peril .

		She does the work because she is in the power of the arch-scoundrel , who poses as her father , and persuades her that she has been guilty of murder .

		She is an unwilling but faithful tool of this villainy until she learns how she has been deceived .

		When
Kestner	PERSON	, the secret service man , gets on her trail , he discov - ers in her a woman to be loved , and in their first encounter she saves his life .

		After being baffled many times in many parts of the world ,
Kestner	PERSON	is at last successful in breaking up the gang and in winning the woman .

		He is a detective of superhuman cunning and re - sourcefulness , and has one hairbreadth escape after another .

		The story is one which gives comforting attention to the details which are so apt to be neglected in fiction of this descrip - tion , and the interest is absorbing .

		Mr.
Warwick Deeping	PERSON	is an accomplished story-teller , but we could wish that he dealt more with modern life than with the artificial conditions imposed by scenes and actions placed in the remote past .

		In '' Marriage by Conquest , '' we have no direct time-indications , but we learn , by gradual degrees , and from various suggestions of costume and custom and social manner , that it is a story of the eight - eenth century , in which the author has pre - viously shown himself to be very much at home .

		The scene is
Sussex	LOCATION	, and the leading characters are three in number .

		First , there is
Stella Shenstone	PERSON	, the widowed chatelaine of
Stonehill	LOCATION	, young and beautiful , but hardened into cynicism by her experience of men .

		Then there is her ferocious and unscrupulous wooer , Sir
Richard Heron	PERSON	of Rush Heath , who pur - sues her with insolent arrogance , and makes
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL himself a terror to all other men who seek her favor .

		Finally , there is
John Flambard	PERSON	of Chevrons , a gentleman by instinct and a scholar by choice , who comes unexpectedly into his English inheritance , and is very much out of place in the society of the loutish Sussex gentry who are his neighbors .

		He wins the love of the fair
Stella	PERSON	, who recovers through his companionship her lost faith in mankind , and he meets the bullying pretensions of his rival with a fine display of moral courage rein - forced by thews that make him a formidable antagonist .

		Sir
Richard	PERSON	, who grows more and more loathsome as his character is revealed , is defeated in his machinations , and even the seeming success of his dastardly assault upon the hero is turned to the credit of the latter , when
Stella	PERSON	rises magnificently to the occasion , and brings some stinging truths home to those who have abetted the persecution of her lover .

		The scene in which she confronts the men who have , at the malignant instance of the villain , conspired to compass the humiliation of the hero , is a fine example of vivid dramatic action .

		The whole story is conceived in the romantic spirit , and is related with both vigor and eloquence .

		The story of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	in
Spain	LOCATION	seemed to us the sum of all romance in the days when
Washington Irving	LOCATION	was a best-seller .

		Since his time , few romantic writers have ventured to intrude upon the domain which he made his own , and the book called '' Daybreak , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Miller	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs. Hack -RRB- comes to us almost as a novelty .

		That the glamour of those scenes and days has not faded beyond the power of revivification is made evident by this brilliant romance of the time of Ferdinand and
Isabella	PERSON	and of the Genoese whose idee fixe opened a new epoch in the world 's history .

		| These are the figures that emerge from the throngs that people the narrative , which is immediately concerned with the siege and fall of
Granada	LOCATION	.

		The private romance is supplied by the love of
Don Beltran Ponce	PERSON	de Leon for a high-born damsel who is Ferdinand 's ward , and who , for reasons of state , is to be forced into an unwilling marriage .

		But love laughs at locksmiths and all other persons who at - tempt to divert its course , and the close of `` Daybreak '' finds the lovers escaped from court and convent and Inquisition , the lady a refugee in
Tangier	LOCATION	, the hero a companion of
Columbus	LOCATION	on the
Santa Maria	LOCATION	.

		A brief final chapter brings them together in the Moorish city , and it is left to be surmised that the only vicissitudes yet in store for them are of the marital description which romantic novelists , as a rule , are prudent enough to avoid .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		The
Baroness von Heyking	PERSON	, who wrote '' The Let - ters Which Never Reached Him , '' has given a most interesting picture of Prussian domestic and diplo - matic life in her newer novel , '' Lovers in Exile '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		After a purely conventional marriage into a typical
Junker	PERSON	family , the heroine meets and loves a young man in the ministry of foreign affairs .

		She has courage enough to divorce her disagreeable husband and marry according to the dictates of her heart .

		The vengeance of the Junkers follows him in his career ; and at last , after he is compelled to bear the burden of an international blunder in what can be quite certainly identified as the Venezuelan incident , he is driven into obscurity .

		It is a well written story , and one of unusual interest to the many who are studying German national psychology .

		For '' The Valley of Tear '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	has taken the resuscitated
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	and given him a typical murder mystery to solve in the first half of the interesting story .

		For the latter half , he deals with the
Molly Maguire	PERSON	atrocities of the ` seventies , the astute and fearless
James McParlan	PERSON	of the
Pinkerton de	ORGANIZATION	- tective agency figuring as the hero under an as - sumed name , the author evidently finding the horrid realities disclosed at the trial of the prin - cipals beyond any powers of invention he himself possesses .

		Indeed , to a generation ignorant of the facts , Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	will be thought lacking in plausi - bility , so steeped in savagery were the
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania miners implicated and punished .

		Old fashioned in the treatment of its characters and its attitude toward life , Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr	PERSON	's '' The Winning of Lucia '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- has been written quite evidently for that young person whom we had supposed was shocked out of existence sev - eral years ago .

		A young man '' with enough of the devil in him to keep the devil out '' loses
Lucia	LOCATION	to a somewhat mephistophelian nobleman , who turns out to be rather soft after great expectations had been aroused concerning his hardness .

		After a series of postponements , both of betrothal and marriage , the young man , having amassed a fortune in specula - tion , marries the fair
Lucia	LOCATION	, also enriched by the nobleman 's selection of her as his heiress .

		It is a mild and uninjurious story .

		`` Dr. Syn : A Smuggler Tale of Romney Marsh '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- is a rollicking , murderous tale of the
early years of the last century	DATE	, in which the protag - onist , an old pirate disguised as a clergyman , matches his wits against those of a King 's officer and is eventually worsted .

		There is nothing dis - tantly resembling a normal human being in the narrative , and there is little done that any normal being thinks could be done .

		The scene is as strange as the deeds set in it , the whole constituting a thorough-going melodrama of the most sensational sort .

		M.
Henry Bordeaux	PERSON	's story of '' Les
Roquevil	PERSON	- lard '' has been ably translated by Mr.
Pitts Duffield	PERSON	and given the title of '' The Will to Live '' -LRB- Duf - field -RRB- .

		It deals with the unity of an ancient family , dishonored by a youthful son of the house ; and the 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	collective grief of the kinsfolk is depicted with fine understanding and vigor .

		The disgrace comes from an elopement with a married woman , who takes the dowry her elderly doting husband has settled upon her .

		For revenge the deserted man accuses the youth of the theft .

		Eventually found not guilty through the father 's eloquent plea in court , the whole circle of his relatives are compelled to suffer with him .

		The book will command both attention and respect .

		Quite typically American are the attributes given by Mr.
Holworthy Hall	PERSON	to the collegians who figure in his `` Pepper '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The hero of the undergraduate episodes at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	here recounted is from
Chicago	LOCATION	, which will perhaps account for his being so successful in making money , both for him - self in a moment of necessity and for others in their want .

		He does not need it , ordinarily speaking , for his father is rich ; but he has a wide fertility of resource which wins him the respect of his asso - ciates and generally the affection of those whom he so cleverly befriends .

		It is an entertaining work , bubbling over with the spirit of youth .

		As many bewildering incidents as can well be crowded into the pages of a single short book make Mr.
John Selborne	PERSON	's `` The Thousand Secrets '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- rather bewildering reading .

		It begins with a mysterious murder , almost immediately com - plicated with international troubles between
Great Britain	LOCATION	, where the scene is variously laid , and two other nations , pseudonymously named .

		A puny love affair rather detracts from than adds to the interest of the book , which is written quite frankly for purposes of mere pastime .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		International perspective in criticism .

		To the rapidly increasing list of books dealing with what will in due time come to be recognized as a new genre in the fine art of literature , an admirable addition has lately been made in Mr.
Gustav Pollak	PERSON	's `` International Perspec - tive in Criticism '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The volume is a well chosen compilation of extracts from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Grillparzer	PERSON	, Sainte-Beuve , and
Lowell	PERSON	dealing with great figures in the literatures of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, with the literature of antiquity , with definitions of a '' classic , '' and with philosophy and religion .

		For the most part these authors are allowed to speak for themselves .

		But Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	has some good things to say about
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's inter - national sympathies .

		Grillparzer 's relentless habit of severe self-scrutiny and steadfast belief in a drama of democracy ,
Sainte-Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's alert curiosity and wide-ranging sympathies , and
Lowell	PERSON	's admirable reconciliation of what are opposites to the small mind , patriotism and cosmopolitanism .

		At the close , in a section called `` Messages from the Masters , '' Mr.
Pol	PERSON	- lak points out that in these men the '' critical '' faculty seems in no wise to have stunted their '' creative '' energy .

		He dwells on their '' in - cessant and passionate endeavour to hold up to their countrymen the great models of for - eign literatures , in order to bring home to them the excellence of their own great writ - ers , '' their steadfast rejection of the '' mediocre and ignoble , '' their `` wholesome dread of pedantry '' combined with their '' steady pur - suit of wisdom , '' their realization of the fact that individual '' liberties '' mean often collec - tive enslavement , their desire that their own countries should see themselves as others see them and thus rise above '' blind chauvinism . ''

		The reading of these men fills Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	with grave fears that '' the restlessness of modern endeavour '' in art and all other forms of life '' betokens only weakness . ''

		As one turns the really liberating pages of this volume one is tempted to make from it many fruitful though perhaps fantastic deductions : that the critic is the most international in spirit among all artists , as the poet has tended to be the most national ; that imperialism and national alli - ances are but crude forms of cosmopolitanism viewed from the wrong side ; that
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	was , for the moment , wiser than any diplomat when he said that we might well some day refuse to make war on
France	LOCATION	because of her beautiful prose ; that the critic is a truer patriot than the imperialist because the im - perialist thinks that his country has a divine wisdom which she must crudely superimpose upon the world , while the critic is so proud of his own country that he despises her limita - tions and would make her grow rich through the absorption of the best traits of her sister countries , to find herself by losing herself , and to discover that just as there is no real quarrel between egoism and altruism -LRB- for the indi - vidual must improve the community in order to improve himself , and he can not improve himself without improving the community -RRB- so there is no real contention between the group - individual , nationalism , and cosmopolitanism .

		son , youngest of the three vari - ously accomplished brothers whose books are widely read on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Sons of the late Primate of the English Church , and of a mother who seems to have exerted a powerful influence for good over her children , the three brothers could not fail , so soon as their literary gifts had made them known to the larger world , to become objects of interest to that world .

		Hence the certainty of a general and cordial welcome to the volume entitled `` Hugh : Memoirs of a Brother ''
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 427 -LRB- Long-mans -RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur Christopher Ben	PERSON	- son , the eldest of the three .

		It is an affectionate , graceful , admiring but by no means indis - criminately laudatory tribute to the memory of an interesting and lovable and strongly marked character ; and the human quality of the book throughout , its attention to little homely details , its success in making both the boy
Hugh	PERSON	and the purposeful man live and breathe before us , will win for it the praise accorded to all biography written with insight and carrying with it the sense of truth to real - ity .

		The more formal and detailed account of Monsignor
Benson	PERSON	's life and w r ork , espe - cially in his character of priest , will appear later from the hand of his friend and co - religionist , Father
C. C. Martindale	PERSON	, S. J. Meanwhile the reader is admitted to some de - lightful intimacies by the brother who presents this preliminary sketch .

		One brief passage from the opening chapter , describing the home that Father
Benson	PERSON	had acquired for himself in his later years , will make evident the variety of talents he possessed . ''

		Everything in the little domain took shape under his skilful hand and ingenious brain .

		He made most of the tapestries in the house with his own fingers , working with his friend Mr.
Gabriel Pippet	PERSON	, the artist .

		He carved much of the panelling he was extraordinarily clever with his hands .

		He painted many of the pictures which hang on the walls , he catalogued the library ; he worked day after day in the garden , weeding , mowing , and planting . ''

		Not the least of the book 's charms is the striking manner in which it incidentally reveals the extent to which autobiography has entered into
Robert Hugh Benson	PERSON	's works of fiction , though this revela - tion is in no sense a surprise .

		The final im - pression of the memoir is of one who high - heartedly and with intense earnestness entered into the tremendous game of life , and played his part nobly and zestfully to the very end .

		Glad did he live and gladly die , and he laid him down with a will .

		Of portraits and other illustrations the book has no lack .

		No more sincere or engrossing piece of writing has come from its author 's pen .

		The oldest and Mr -
George P. Upton	PERSON	has done most enduring another good service tor music form of music .

		-LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The subject is an especially in - teresting one .

		The spontaneous utterance of the race in music has been chiefly in the song .

		Among all nations have been found these free expressions of feeling .

		They have varied in form , in rhythm , in color , with the changing skies under which they have been produced .

		They have been embodiments of all the emo - tions which fill the hearts of mankind .

		They have been the rich and lavish material to which the learned composers have gone for themes which could be worked up into imposing musical structures .

		They have voiced the hopes , the fears , the aspirations of mankind from the earliest periods .

		They are to-day as living as they ever were , and they constitute the music which everyone understands and which everyone enjoys .

		Mr.
Upton	PERSON	thus ex - plains the purpose of his book : '' In carrying out his scheme the author has confined his selection and classes to song in the English tongue , making little reference to songs of other countries , except in chapters relating to their origin and evolution .

		He has also sought to trace the various functions of the song , and to attempt to explain why some of the simplest of the old songs live on , generation after gen - eration , as fresh and forceful as when they were written , while so many of the higher and more elaborate musical forms perish or are soon forgotten .

		In a word , the writer has sought to present the story , the psychology , and mission of the song , the oldest and most enduring form of music . ''

		It would be easy , in making such an effort , to become lost in the multiplicity of details and , while being ade - quately encyclopaedic , to fail sadly in keeping up the indubitable interest of the subject .

		No such disaster has overtaken the present author .

		Our enjoyment waxes as we proceed , and the value of the book is enhanced by the manner of presentation .

		Our old favorites appear unshorn of the attraction which they have always possessed .

		We learn a good deal of the peoples who have here so clearly and unre - servedly manifested themselves .

		We may not entirely give ourselves up to their intense and sanguinary developments of patriotic devotion to the fatherland ; but for unhampered im - mersion in the domestic affections , for the delight in the simple amusements of daily life , for the hymning of the higher experiences , we can have only sympathy and gratitude .

		The many who love the old songs will assur - edly give this book a cordial welcome .

		So vividly are they portrayed that the types depicted in these pen-sketches seem to stand forth like so many bronze statues one has come upon unexpectedly out in the open .

		Whole sentences linger in the mind long after the book is laid aside .

		For instance , there is the artist who declares that it does not matter whether you have anything to express , so long 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	as you express it ; the young woman who flings open all the doors of life , and is so continually going out and coming in that life has con - siderable difficulty in catching a glimpse of her at all ; the perfect one who had heard of '' the people , '' and , indeed , at times had seen and smelt them ; and the superlative whose poet was
Blake	PERSON	, whose novelist was
Dostoiev	PERSON	- sky , and whose playwright was
Strindberg	LOCATION	, for who else was there who had gone outside the range of normal , stupid , rational humanity , and shown the marvellous qualities of the human creature drunk or dreaming 1 ?

		It is given to few artists to reveal the soul with Mr.
Galsw	PERSON	r orthy 's penetration , to write with his brilliance .

		`` A Simple Tale , '' one of the short stories of the volume , contains a weird and unforgettable character , near kin to Mr.
Stone	PERSON	of `` Fraternity '' and the very shadow of old age itself , who thinks himself the Wan - dering Jew .

		The title piece is a whimsical satire , having for its characters an English - man and his wife , an American , a German , the Little Man , and a woman with two bundles and a baby , who are waiting for their train on an Austrian railway platform .

		The men are trying to find a definition for true heroism .

		Catastrophe befalls the Little Man , the only one who attempts to put theory into practice ; but Fate is at hand to throw in one of her happy endings -LRB- she has robbed so many lives of them that she ought to have them to squan - der -RRB- , and the curtain falls as the American snaps his kodak on the sobered group .

		Just what , we begin to wonder , is the significance of all this ?

		Can it be that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is trying to say that it is just as heroic to lug a baby and two bundles for a woman crying in distress , as , let us say , to steer a
Zeppelin	LOCATION	over ?

		But we are on forbidden ground .

		In a warning note the author states expressly that the piece was written in
1913	DATE	, and has nothing whatever to do , however darkly and deeply , with the Great War .

		The problem of sex control .

		The perennial problem of the control of the determination of sex never loses interest , partly because of its relations to the economic inter - ests of the animal breeder and partly by rea - son of its ever present appeal to parents .

		The progress of biological inquiry into the struc - ture and behavior of the sex cells , the trans - mission of hereditary characters from parents to children , and the application of the experi - mental method to the modification of sexual characters and to the control of sex among animals , have brought to light a great mass of data , much of it obscure in its significance , not a little of it conflicting in character , and practically all of it suggesting several differ - ent conclusions .

		Out of this confusion some general results are emerging which point the way for further investigation rather than afford generalizations of sweeping import .

		Dr.
L. Doncaster	PERSON	, of King 's College , Cam - bridge , has set forth these results in his '' Determination of Sex '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- in a criti - cal and constructive way .

		supplementing the data of others by his own interpretations and suggestions .

		His work is of necessity some - what technical and highly specialized , though the glossary and the simplicity and clarity of his style will assist the non-technical reader through the mazes of chromosomes , hetero - zygotes , and gynandromorphs .

		The topics discussed include the nature and functions of sex , the stage of development at which sex is determined , sex-limited inheritance , the sex ratio , identical twins , secondary sexual char - acters , the transmission of secondary sexual characters , hermaphroditism , and the deter - mination of sex in man .

		With regard to the last , the author inclines to the view that , although the problem is far from solution , there is still hope for an ultimate victory .

Japan	LOCATION	; and the apparent and probable effects upon these civilizations of contact with the West . ''

		His essay , which is divided into three parts and a conclusion , fills less than ninety rather small pages ; but every paragraph is thoughtful and suggestive .

		In fact , the tiny volume contains much more mental pabulum than is to be found in many bulkier productions , and is well worth read - ing .

		At the same time we ought to note that it will not offer much that is essentially new to those who are familiar with the author 's `` Appearances , '' reviewed at some length in our issue of
December 16	DATE	last .

		It is hardly necessary to add that Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's hand has lost nothing of its cunning , and that the essay is a delightful example of style .

Lieuten	PERSON	- ant
E. Keble Chatterton	ORGANIZATION	, R.N.V.R. , devotes an entertaining and fully illustrated volume -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Previous works by the same writer attest both his interest and his qualifi - cations ; and in his new book he has added a series of chapters to the annals of the sea which needed to be particularized .

		Begin - ning with the first operations of the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	, after a survey of the voy - ages and discoveries that made the Company possible , carrying his tale from the pages of Hakluyt down into the
last century	DATE	, when the monopoly of the Company was taken from it and the need for maintaining a fleet of ships , most of them well armed against pirates , privateers , and the ships of European enemies , ceased , he buttresses the late Ad - miral
Mahan	PERSON	's theory of sea power from one cover to another .

		There was fighting enough in the old days , and on at least one occasion the
East Indiamen	LOCATION	proved too powerful for a French squadron .

		Something might have been said about the various flags and ensigns shown in the numerous pictures of these gal - lant old craft , the more so as facing page 78 is a flag identical with the one flown at
Washington	LOCATION	's headquarters at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1775	DATE	, with the
Union Jack	ORGANIZATION	and thirteen stripes , apparently red and white .

		The work sadly needs an index .

		The making Professor
George M. Priest	PERSON	of of modern
Princeton	LOCATION	has written a lucid and interesting history of '' Ger - many since 1740 '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , which will doubt - less find many readers in the present posture of international affairs .

		The difficult task of writing an historical narrative where there is , for the most part , no one focal point , is here solved with considerable skill .

		The slow amalgamation of the scattered and impotent German states into one of the greatest powers in human history may be followed clearly in this book of two hundred pages , from which superfluous facts have been carefully elimi - nated .

		The tone of the writer is sympathetic but critical .

		His detachment becomes espe - cially observable in the latter part of the book , where he has to deal with the amazing com - mercial and industrial development of Ger - many which has imparted such a sinister materialistic aspect to life there .

		The worship of force , a legacy from
Bismarck	LOCATION	, has been further fostered by this consciousness of eco - nomic strength , and has tended to overshadow other elements in the German character .

		Its fruition is the present war , for which Ger - many is , in the author 's opinion , only proxi - mately to blame , the fundamental guilt being shared , at least to some extent , by the other great powers of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		For the general reader , Professor Priest 's book is the most commendable account extant of the develop - ment of what is just now the most interesting , though not the best beloved , country in the world .

		The abhorrence which most peo - P ^ e instinctively exhibit towards snakes , lizards , and salamanders does not seem to reduce popular interest in these long since decadent groups of the lower 430 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	vertebrates .

		The reptile house at the zoologi - cal garden is full of attraction , not only because of its potentialities in hair-raising thrills but also because of its varied interests which increase greatly with acquaintance .

		Mr.
E. G. Boulenger	PERSON	's volume entitled '' Rep - tiles and Batrachians '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is based upon the author 's experience as curator of the famous collection of lower vertebrates in the Zoological Gardens of the Zoological So - ciety in
Regent	ORGANIZATION	's Park ,
London	LOCATION	.

		It gives a general account of the classification of these two groups of animals , with a brief discussion of the more interesting facts of natural his - tory pertaining to the representative reptiles , the crocodiles , alligators , lizards , slowworms , turtles , tortoises , and snakes of the world , and likewise of the amphibians including the frogs , toads , tree-toads , salamanders , and water pup - pies .

		It discusses distribution , food and feed - ing habits , life history , behavior , poison fangs and poisons , and breeding habits , affording a mine of trustworthy information on a wide range of forms .

		The book deals with leading species from all continents , and includes a con - siderable number of American species .

		It is illustrated with one hundred and seventy-six plates , mostly reproductions from original photographs of living animals made by Mr.
W. S. Berridge	PERSON	.

Thomas H. Dickinson	PERSON	An anthology nag ma -LRB- J e a judicious Selection of modern plays .

		J .

		oi plays tor his anthology 01 `` Chief Contemporary Dramatists '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		Allowing for the exigencies of copyright , of author 's permission in several cases , of accessibility in translation , the dramas in - cluded are as nearly representative as any group so arbitrarily chosen could possibly be .

		By a somewhat daring and curious turn of logic , the editor explains that
Ibsen	PERSON	was omit - ted because he is too much the pioneer of the contemporary movement , too fully its source and exemplar .

		The omission of representative plays by
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Barrie	PERSON	is enforced .

		En - glish drama is represented by
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	,
Pinero	PERSON	,
Jones	PERSON	,
Galsworthy	PERSON	, and
Barker	PERSON	; Irish by
Yeats	PERSON	,

Hauptmann	PERSON	and
Sudermann	PERSON	; and French and Belgian by
Brieux	LOCATION	,
Hervieu	PERSON	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Serious plays predominate ; but the editor forestalls any criticism on this point by sug - gesting that it is not his fault but the fault of the age .

		The volume is carefully edited in detail ; its notes are concise ; its bibliographies are brief but adequate .

		That it will prove an indispensable handbook for students of the modern drama , goes without saying .

		An anthology of this kind is in itself so much a pioneer , so much an innovation , and it con - tains so much that is admirable , that to quarrel with its contents were like holding a grudge against the gods for having led us out into the open road , where we expected only a path .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We are glad to note that Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	's vol - ume of verse , '' North of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' the English edition of which we reviewed in our issue of
Oct. 1	DATE	last , has been published in this country by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An American edition of Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's first volume , `` A Boy 's Will , '' is also issued at the same time by the same publishers .

		Interest in the
West	LOCATION	, in this year of the exposi - tion , is not limited to
California	LOCATION	.

		Those who plan to visit
America	LOCATION	's only '' geyser land '' and desire a complete historical and descriptive guide to the region , will find what they seek in General
Hiram M. Chittenden	PERSON	's '' The
Yellowstone National Park	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Stewart & Kidd Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , now revised and enlarged and brought thoroughly up to date .

		New revised editions , in both instances the third , of Mr.
Hubert Howe Bancroft	PERSON	's '' The New Pacific '' and '' Retrospection '' have recently been published by the
Bancroft Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The interest of the veteran Californian in men and institutions and problems of the day remains undiminished , and his comments are no less fearless or illuminating than of old .

		The two volumes are issued together in a box .

		A textbook on advertising that deals with the economic , psychological , and physical factors of the subject , as well as principles of artistic arrange - ment and composition in the preparation of '' copy , '' has been prepared by Messrs.
Harry Tipper	PERSON	,
Harry L. Hollingworth	PERSON	,
George Burton Hotchkiss	PERSON	, and
Frank Alvah Parsons	PERSON	, each one of whom is qualified by experience and training for his task and is an expert in his field .

		A distinctive feature of the volume is the outline of an advertis - ing campaign in actual operation .

		Elaborate illus - trations of successful display advertising , are included .

Ronald Press Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A second edition of ''
Routledge	PERSON	's New English Dictionary of the English Language , '' edited by Mr.
Cecil Weatherley	PERSON	, has been issued by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		Some of its features are : condensation secured through judicious grouping of derivatives with the vocabulary word , which has resulted in the elimination of unnecessary definitions ; the inclusion of all the principal new terms in the sciences and the applied and fine arts , of modern colloquial slang both English and American , and of idiomatic words with their usages ; and the ready use for sources of the '' Encyclopaedia Bri - tannica '' and such dictionaries as the '' Oxford English , '' the '' Century , '' and the latest edition of
Webster	PERSON	's '' International . ''

		Convenient in size , and clear in typography , the volume forms a most desirable reference book for the desk or library .

		They are '' The Ethical and Social Significance of Personality '' by Professor

Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, will contain as an appendix eleven of
Vaughan	ORGANIZATION	's letters which have been recently discovered .

		They were written to
John Aubrey	PERSON	and
Anthony Wood	PERSON	, and they add something to our knowledge of a poet about whose biography less has hitherto been known than about any of the other
Caroline	PERSON	or Jacobean poets of his rank .

		Mr.
L. C. Martin	PERSON	, who edits the volume , has also made the first authentic collation of the text of the poems .


Edward Cook	PERSON	, a prominent member of the old - time publishing fraternity of
Chicago	LOCATION	, died on the 20th inst. , at his home in
Oak Park	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	came to
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	.

		He was one of the organizers of the publishing house of
Ivison	PERSON	,
Blakeman & Taylor	ORGANIZATION	, which later became part of the American Book Company .

		For several years he was a partner in the publishing firm of
Jansen , McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, later
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was a prominent member of the Masonic order , 432 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 27	DATE	and wrote much of the Masonic law for Masons of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		He was a trustee of
Scoville Institute of Oak Park	ORGANIZATION	, and a member of the Sons of the Amer - ican Revolution .

		A recent announcement of the Doves Press con - tains the following : '' The Great War has not been ' forgotten ' or ' forgiven , ' nor is it even finished .

		But the first shock , which seemed to obliterate both Past and Future and to engulf all in one foul tri - umph of hate , is over , and both Past and Future re-emerge and re-assume their reign despite the ' inscrutable horror ' of to-day .

		With this larger outlook Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	returns to his first intention before the war , and will in the immediate future print and publish the ' Lieder ,
Gedichte	PERSON	, and
Balladen	PERSON	' of
Germany	LOCATION	's supreme poet ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, in honour of
Germany	LOCATION	's better past and in hope of
Germany	LOCATION	's still greater future when she shall have sloughed off the hate which , to-day , bedarkens both her and our Welt-Ansicht and World - Vision . ''

		A minor effect of the war has been the marked awakening of interest in Russian literature evi - denced by English readers .

		As one result of this , an attempt is being made by
Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	, in a series of '' Great Russian Fiction , '' to cover the whole range of Russian imaginative literature in a library of uniform volumes at a popular price .

		The following works will be ready immediately : '' The Captain 's Daughter and Other Tales , '' by ` Pushkin ; '' On the Eve , '' by Turgenev ; '' The Heart of a Russian , '' by Lemontov ; '' Little Angel , '' by Andreiev ; '' In Honour 's Name , '' by
Kuprin	PERSON	; and two of Gorky 's works '' Com - rades '' and '' Chelkash . ''

		It is hoped to include among the later volumes some novels and stories by
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	,
Gogol	LOCATION	,
Gontcharov	LOCATION	,
Korolenko	LOCATION	, and others .

		One year of the Index Office , a corporation not for pecuniary profit , organized early in
1914	DATE	'' as a reference bureau and intermediary between libra - ries and the public , to perform , for a moderate charge , such services as libraries are not prepared to perform , namely , to index , compile , abstract , and translate such literary material as investigators need to have prepared for their use , '' seems to have demonstrated the usefulness of that institution , which at the outset was favorably noticed in these columns .

		In the initial number of its '' Reference Bulletin , '' lately issued , it gives some details of its first year 's activities .

		Medical students and physi - cians have apparently been its chief patrons , and they have called for a number of bibliographies and abstracts on subjects interesting to them .

		It an - nounces its intention to publish '' Dementia Precox Studies '' and occasional bibliographies on the sub - ject by Dr.
Bayard Holmes	PERSON	.

		Bibliographical in - dexes and references fill six of the Bulletin 's eight pages .

		In a recent issue of THE DIAL we noted the fact that the quarterly of Oriental study , '' Le Museon , '' long published by the
University of Louvain	ORGANIZATION	, would be carried on by the
Cambridge University Press of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American agency for the publica - tion , as we now learn , has just been undertaken by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over two hun - dred pages of material for the third and fourth numbers of '' Le Museon '' for
1914	DATE	are supposed to have been lost in the fire which destroyed the offices of the Belgian publisher in the early days of
August	DATE	; and one of the collaborators on the last number of the journal was taken prisoner in the war and died in a hospital .

		All supporters of Oriental studies will be glad to know that the first issue of this journal for
1915	DATE	will soon be published , with contributions from many well-known conti - nental and English scholars ; and interest in a review published under such unusual circumstances is confidently expected to be shown by American scholars especially interested in these fields of research .

		One of the most striking and unaccountable instances of popular neglect of a brilliant writer is to be found in the case of
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	.

		In the face of this neglect it is a bold , though a most com - mendable , enterprise to project a complete edition of
Bagehot	PERSON	's writings .

		Such an edition , in ten volumes , edited by
Bagehot	PERSON	's sister-in-law , Mrs.
Russell Barrington	PERSON	, will be published next month by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	.

		Much important matter is now reprinted for the first time , including the first two articles by
Bagehot	PERSON	which appeared in '' The Prospective Review '' in
1848	DATE	, various pamphlets on political economy , a series of essays written in early youth , and a volume of selected papers from '' The Economist , '' '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' and '' The Spectator . ''

		The first volume of the new edition will include the memoir by
Bagehot	PERSON	's life - long friend ,
Richard Holt Hutton	PERSON	, originally pub - lished in '' The Fortnightly Review '' and later reprinted as a preface to Volume I. of
Bagehot	PERSON	's '' Literary Studies , '' together with the second memoir by the same writer , contributed to the '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	. ''

Philosophy of Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	was the dominant philosophy in American universities ; and it is to the Scottish president of an American college -LRB-
James McCosh	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	-RRB- that we owe the most comprehensive study of it .

		In
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	it has never been much appreciated , but in
France	LOCATION	it exercised a great influence through Victor Cousin -LRB- 1792-1867 -RRB- , who made it the greatest power in French philosophy of the period .

		In recent years , in
France	LOCATION	, there has been a recrudescence of interest in the Scottish philosophy through the writings of Professor
T. T. Laurie	PERSON	, who attempted , in several able works , a critical reconstruction of the traditional
Scottish Natural Realism	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Scottish Philosophy of Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	originated as a protest against the skeptical conclusions of
Hume	PERSON	, and the hypotheses found in
Locke	LOCATION	and
Descartes	LOCATION	.


Thomas Reid	PERSON	was the first man to see clearly the genesis of
Hume	PERSON	's skepticism , and in this little volume he gives an admirable account of his investigations of the principles upon which this skeptical system was built .

		474 A BULL IN THE EDUCATIONAL CHINA-SHOP .

		There lies heavily upon our table a pamphlet in a neutral gray cover , containing nearly a thousand pages most of them in fine print , and bearing the innocuous title : '' Report upon the Survey of the
University of Wiscon	ORGANIZATION	- sin . ''

		This is not an ordinary official docu - ment ; it is a most extraordinary one .

		May it long remain unique !

		Democratic etiquette requires that public linen shall be washed in public .

		However decorous the arrangement of the clothes on the line , the tout ensemble is not inspiring .

		A considerable part of the `` Survey '' relates to matters of
University	ORGANIZATION	housekeeping , methods , accounts , forms , ap - pliances , machinery , statistics ; all this is no concern of ours .

		The officials responsible for the undertaking are `` the
State Board of Public Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, '' composed of the Governor and other prominent citizens .

		Their concise report is a proper statement of the university 's policy , record , and management ; it is sporadi - cally critical , but sane in criticism and com - mendation .

		The facts speak adequately , and reflect the usual wisdom interspersed with myopic vision that makes educational history in this overgrown country of ours .

		The mas - sive bulk of the volume is the work of one
William H. Allen	PERSON	, Ph.D. , the official surveyor .

		The manner in which his inquisitorial task is accomplished necessitates a copious comple - ment of commentaries by various members of the Faculty of the surveyed university .

		The function of these commentaries is to set forth the versatile fallacies and to correct the com - prehensive distortions with which the `` Allen '' report is saturated .

		Thus denatured , the document to the discerning becomes inoffen - sive by becoming ridiculous ; and yet it re - mains a tragedy in effect , a farce in execution .

		When Dr.
Allen	PERSON	's methods are vivisected by shrewd and patient diagnosticians -LRB- whose services at the least deserve a national monu - ment -RRB- their barrenness is pitiable .

		A list of thirty-seven things which the dean of the graduate school of the much lauded
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	is not expected to do , is gravely cited as a comprehensive arraignment of the 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	incompetence and negligence of that officer , `` without evidence being presented that it is desirable or practicable to do any one of the thirty-seven things . ''

		Had the dean actually subscribed to these thirty-seven articles , it would have been adequate cause in the minds of many to invite his resignation ; and it is fairly probable that had he been thus guilty , these same '' facts '' of commission might have been cited by another '' Dr.
Allen	PERSON	'' as evidence of the manner in which the dean wastes his time .

		The justly despairing commentator re - sorts to the deadly parallel : `` Using the method of Dr.
Allen	PERSON	, it might be said : -LRB- a -RRB- No attempt has been made to determine the average size of shoes worn by professors '' ; or the relation of the color of their hair to '' efficiency of instruction , '' or of the color of their eyes to '' efficiency in research , '' or other deadly sins of omission more than seven times seven .

		Under such irritation , sooner or later , even the academic spirit rebels .

		On page 197 we reach the verdict : '' To resort , for once , to the vernacular , this is rot . ''

		More soberly expressed : `` No statement of facts and no conclusion or recommendation of Dr.
Allen	PERSON	can be accepted without verification . '' ''

		The intellectual life and the life of the spirit are to Dr.
Allen	PERSON	what a symphony is to the deaf-mute or a sunset to the blind . '' ''

		The survey of the graduate school has been mainly directed to its clothes rather than to the living being beneath the clothes . ''

		Mis-statement , mis-quotation , garbled reports , direct untruth - fulness , insinuations , unwarranted implica - tions , ignorant interpretations , mechanical manipulation of statistics , are all charged against Dr.
Allen	PERSON	; and with a ruthless frank - ness , scathing in its charitable reserve , are proved to the hilt .

		Even in the handling of the naked sabre of statistics , the hand that wields the weapon receives the wound . ''

		If Dr.
Allen	PERSON	's computations are correct , more than
90 %	PERCENT	of the teaching of the college costs less than
42 %	PERCENT	of the salaries , '' a reductio ad absurdum .

		In fact , so ignorant is Dr.
Allen	PERSON	of the meaning of numbers that he converts a cold statistical statement that class-markings follow the law of distribution of averages into a deliberate intention on the part of the in - structor to repress talent .

		But enough of this superfluous exhibition of the mischief that one stray bull in a china-shop can do -LRB- and be paid handsomely for his havoc -RRB- , and to the point : Why are these things ?

		Is the
Allen	PERSON	report a rare and negligible patho - logical specimen , or is it a significant symptom of a prevalent disease ?

		How comes it that the legislature of a great State subjects its great - est institution to so unworthy and so futile and so expensive a procedure ?

		Why should a body of scholars be harassed by 50-page ques - tion-sheets , and distracted by an impertinent and aimless '' Survey '' ?

		Why should a docu - ment more voluminous than President
Stanley Hall	PERSON	's great two - volume work on '' Educational Problems '' -LRB- to mention the most comprehen - sive of recent contributions to educational literature -RRB- be printed and circulated as Ex - hibits A and B and C to
Ampersand	LOCATION	, of irrele - vance and obliquity ?

		That '' something is rotten in the state of
Denmark	LOCATION	'' is the ready conclusion .

		Well !

		`` Yes '' and `` No . ''

		Anyone acquainted with the uncritical manner in which decisive steps of this kind are taken will at once relieve those responsible for the '' Survey '' of the charge of any lack of good will , of appreciation of the higher education , or of good judgment in adjusting desirable ends to possible means .

		Off-hand , it seems a good thing to take stock and have an expert accounting .

		Such '' goods '' come high , but their higher sanction is Econ - omy with a capital E. And there 's the rub !

		Commercial-mindedness has so insidiously eaten its way into the judicial fibre of the American mind , that its workings have become untrustworthy .

		So when a plausible man comes along with a plausible scheme to test the higher education , and reform its extrava - gance , and tabulate it , and cost-account its every item , and prune research and similar luxuries , and introduce supervised instruc - tion , and bring the plant up-to-date , and scrap its inefficient professors , one person in author - ity is impressed , a few more are acquiescent , and the scheme goes through .

		Of course there should have been a watch-dog on the grounds to indicate the true character of the intruder ; but there was not , because as a people we do not like alarmists any more than we like `` knockers , '' and we prefer to take our fore - thought after something has happened .

		If the
University	ORGANIZATION	concerned had protested , charges of interested motives and a fear of baring the truth would have been promptly imputed .

		No one expected this kind of a survey ; and it is only fair to admit that so extreme a genius for blundering must be unusual .

		It is hard luck that the result is as preposterous as it
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 447 turned out to be ; but perhaps that is the fortunate thing about it .

		If the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	survey serves to prevent a similar profane invasion of sacred territory , and thus to guar - antee the peace of the academic world for a reasonable period , the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	sacrifice will not have been in vain .

		Yet it would be rash to assume that this moral will be drawn univer - sally ; and once more , there 's the rub !

		For down at the bottom of our hearts , where convictions germinate , there is a suspicion of learning , which will not easily be uprooted .

		We are practical to the point of obsession ; which means that we lose sight of the most obvious practicality in the world , in that we insist upon results and are impatient of means .

		But more than that : there has grown to im - mense proportions the newer efficiency , that puts forward method as a panacea , invents `` perfect '' systems , and is absorbed in mechan - isms and oblivious of purposes .

		It has made the business sense of the community , which runs things , insensitive to values .

		This same business sense accuses the professor of a lack of practicality , and entirely overlooks that all this alleged efficiency of beginning on the stroke of the bell and quitting when the whis - tle blows , and using all the class-rooms all the time , and reducing the cost of unit-instruction per student neurone , is just plain , bald , bare assumption .

		There is not a fact or a shred of evidence anywhere to prove that the most important discoveries or the best educated individuals come from institutions in which these things are carefully looked into , and that the neglect of them or reasonable attention to them has differentiated one type of institution from another .

		Then there is the peculiar in - fatuation with facts dressed in modern tabular attire , which the tailor assures you is the `` correct '' thing .

		So the surveyor is con - stantly insisting that he wants facts , facts , FACTS .

		But Tie decides what facts he wants ; assumption again .

		The size of the professor 's shoes is a fact , and is readily ascertained .

		It has a glorious definiteness , and the curve of distribution would admirably prove that pro- fessors are not superior to , are not even differ - ent from , other foot-geared mortals .

		The relevancy of a fact , or the interpretation of a fact , is to the , practical man merely an opinion , not to be seriously considered .

		And that is why he is so easily taken in by plausible pre - sumption .

		He accepts labels for things , and a record for the experience .

		Of course in his own field he knows better ; he does not count all his promissory notes as equally valid assets : he has a pretty exact notion of what he can collect .

		And yet the mystery of these endless pages of utterly useless misconstruction remains .

		Are our universities really to be threatened periodically by such futile absurdities ?

		What will our foreign critics think of us ?

		It may be a joke at home , where we make allowances ; but it becomes a shame abroad , where it travels on its face value .

		And does any person in his senses really believe that the cause of higher education , or any worthy cause whatever , can be advanced by industrious ant-hills of such petty , carping , querulous , specious pellets of inconsequence ?

		Can the surveyor himself believe in it ; or is it more charitable to regard him as a fraud rather than a fool ?

		If the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	survey is to take its place in history as an isolated case of an obscure mental dis - ease , it does not much matter what the answer may be .

		But if this sort of thing is going to break out epidemically or sporadically , we must find the antidote ; and it may not be a simple matter .

		For the decision to have sur - veys rests with a small group of men ; and if they are susceptible to the wiles of special pleaders , there is little hope .

		It is well enough to point out that for any one man to frame thousands of questions , make hundreds upon hundreds of recommendations on any and every detail of a university 's activities , deter - mining off-hand that a foreign language is unnecessary and so is military drill , that the president should not be a member of the gov - erning body , what students should pay for board , how faculty meetings shall be con - ducted and doctor 's dissertations written , and so on endlessly , that all this is a colossal piece of impudence , which would indicate exactly the type of man you are dealing with .

		But the fact remains that when once the offi - cial inquiry takes this form , there is no ma - chinery available for stopping it , short of the threat of resignation of the entire Faculty , and who ever heard of professors acting col - lectively ?

		The law provides ; the money is spent ; and the report goes forth .

		It would be possible to introduce a vaccina - tion -RRB- campaign in any educational area in which the efficiency germ is likely to find a favorable culture-bed ; the operation has a good chance of `` taking '' and conferring a temporary immunity .

		The only permanent 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	protection is in the way of a wide-spread and deep appreciation of the needs of the educa - tional provisions for public welfare .

		How - ever spasmodic and uncertain our educational efforts , they have proved adequate to safe - guard cultural interests .

		The private institu - tions , with their capacities to mobilize their alumni reserves , are fairly safe from attack .

		The State institutions find their vulnerable point in the legislative plexus .

		The demo - cratic test is a peculiar one : it insists that every proposal must be capable of convincing a lay jury of its wisdom and necessity .

		The mentality of that jury is the critical issue ; also the attitude in which it is encouraged or permitted to approach its authoritative dis - pensations .

		Political authority unquestion - ably includes the right to meddle with things imperfectly understood , and to override the judgments of those by attainment especially conversant with the delicate interests of the higher education .

		Whether that dubious privi - lege shall be exercised depends upon the practical conception of the purpose of the political instrument .

		The responsibility goes back to the universities themselves .

		They must decide whether they have remained true to their trust , or in a spirit of compromise have bartered their birthright for a mess of pottage ; they must examine whether the con - ception of a university which they have de - fended has encouraged unwise interference , and provoked the use of the legislative blud - geon .

		For there the efficiency promoters and the energetic grinders of axes and the childish nursers of private grudges find sympathetic response .

		It comes with a sense of shock that such undesirable forces should be able to assert their powers and weaken , even under - mine , the foundations of our highest inter - ests .

		Possibly this ponderous monument of the folly and the danger of such a policy may lead the reflective to ponder .

		For the
Allen	PERSON	mausoleum , in view of the transitoriness of mundane things , the epitaph is easy to select : `` Verily this is rot . ''

		But as a constant re - minder of the watchfulness that is the price of educational safety a more stable and a more spiritual conscience and consciousness are indispensable .

		After every political cam - paign we learn that once more , and however the election turns , the country has been saved .

		The saving forces of the educational interests will rally to the charge .

		VEEBOTEN .

		It is
Sunday	DATE	.

		We are five at dinner , talking of the sinking of the `` Lusitania , '' and our voices are subdued .

		One of us is a German , a teacher of German , an interpreter of
Germany	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	.

		Another is of German stock ; his ancestors had come to the
United States	LOCATION	after
' 48	DATE	, leaving a brother dead in the fight for freedom .

		The third is a Jew , German-born and wont on occasion to tell us that he was made in
Germany	LOCATION	and improved in
America	LOCATION	.

		The fourth is pure American , of Puritan stock , the dean of our group .

		He is old enough to be the father of the oldest of us ; his choice of us as table-mates we regard as a great compli - ment .

		We defer to him in all our disputes , to his humor and to his experience .

		He is largely German-trained , a great lover of
Germany	LOCATION	, particularly of
Gottingen	LOCATION	, where he had stud - ied ; now and then he would tell us charming stories of his student-days .

		Of recent years it was his custom to return to
Germany	LOCATION	every
summer	DATE	.

		This day our talk has been less certain and less frank than is our custom .

		We have been skirting the edge of the topic , dwelling on the pity of it .

		We all exhibit strain , as in a house of mourning ; silences , eloquent with tension , fall too often .

		At the end of one of these comes the voice of the Jew , low , but no longer hesitant , as if he has determined to cut through our reservations .

		`` You know how I have always tried to explain , to explain away .

		But this time ' when I read the paper I could n't believe it at first , and when I found I had to I felt a rush of anger , I wanted to crush that submarine - captain in my two hands , to break him in halves .

		At home I found my weekly '
Staats Zeitung	PERSON	. '

		The next thing I knew half of it was on the floor under my feet , the rest twisted to pieces in my hands .

		I was crying inwardly , God punish
Germany	LOCATION	! ''

		In the silence that followed we could hear the German 's breathing .

		He opened his mouth once or twice , but did not say anything .

		He was very pale .

		Finally he burst out .

		`` You , you !

		But what is the use ?

		You do not understand , you can not understand .

		I know what you all think , you , my friends .

		You have thought it from the beginning .

		Nothing that we may say or do will make you think otherwise , though we have pleaded and conceded and humbled ourselves for your American friendship , yes , even intrigued for it .

		But you also are in the league against us , the chief bulwark of our enemies .

		Here are you four all German-born or German - trained , yet I know from his silence that
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 even
Kurt	PERSON	here , who bears the name of an uncle who died for a free
Germany	LOCATION	in
' 48	DATE	, even
Kurt	PERSON	has condemned us .

		And
Jacob	PERSON	, you heard what he said .

		He forgets what his own people are suffering at the hands of the Poles and the Russians .

		He forgets that it is also their battle we are fighting , quite as much as our own , the battle of civilization against barbarism .

		And he w r ants us crushed for a fair act of war !

		But , I ask you what could we do ?

		`` We are fighting for our national life , against overwhelming odds alone in the centre of an iron circle of ene - mies whose one grievance against us is that we are prosperous and civilized .

		We did not want war ; we do not want war .

		We are the most peaceful people in
Europe	LOCATION	, hard-work - ing , studious , devoted to the ideal , to the bet - terment of mankind .

		Our one crime which you call militarism is self-defence .

		Only yesterday you took your ideals and standards from us , from our educational system , from our industries , from our arts , from everything .

		You sent your young men to study in our uni - versities and to learn our ways .

		You copied our scientists and philosophers .

		If you had been able , you would have copied our civic organization and social and economic methods .

		Your travellers and your scholars praised us by word and by pen .

		And now what has hap - pened ?

		Have we changed over-night that you should call us Huns and barbarians and makers of war on women and children ?

		It is absurd !

		We are the same as we always were ; the war has made no difference in us .

		We have broken no law .

		We have hurt none whom we could save .

		We have merely defended our - selves .

		You would allow a dog fighting for his life against a pack of wolves greater freedom than we have taken for ourselves . ''

		He rose and left us before we could stop him .

		After a pause the Jew said : '' There is some - thing in that .

		Our turnover has been com - plete .

		I suppose because the contrast between the German at war and the German in peace is so violent that both ca n't be real . ''

		`` Hold on , '' said the
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` I am not sure that the violence of the contrast does n't mean that both must be real . ''

		We looked our question .

		`` Well , here is what I mean .

		You 've both read
Bedier	PERSON	's collection of citations from the diaries German soldiers are required to write his Crimes allemands ?

		I daresay your im - pression was the same as mine : the general mood of
Bedier	PERSON	's evidence implied more than the mere execution of the ' orders of the day ' a willingness , a kind of joy , a gloating . ''

		`` No , no , '' expostulated the German - Amer - ican . ''

		Yes ,
Kurt	PERSON	, like a hungry man 's when he 's eating , or better , like a child 's , free at last from the restraints of school . '' ''

		I do n't understand , '' said
Kurt	PERSON	rather coldly .

		`` I 'm afraid not .

		Perhaps I do n't under - stand , myself .

		But man and boy , I have known
Germany	LOCATION	for over forty years .

		I was one of the earliest of the Americans who went over there to study , and I have been there since repeatedly .

		I have seen the change of the old
Germany	LOCATION	into the new as it came .

		You might sum it all up by the word Verboten . ''

		You see , the
Germany	LOCATION	I first knew was the
Germany	LOCATION	of your grandfather ,
Kurt	PERSON	, and it was n't very different from the
Germany	LOCATION	of your great-grandfather , a pleasant , sleepy , dreamy country , rather messy , very indus - trious , very pious , sentimental , and most awfully wordy .

		People were not concerned about government , except when they made a holiday and the guard turned out .

		Whatever you called the form of government , there was a great deal of personal and social freedom .

		You went where you pleased , and did what you pleased ; you did n't have to have pass - ports , nor get out of the way of the military .

		Life was easier than it was here , but essentially as democratic .

		You were certain , as , save for the wordiness , nowadays you ca n't be , of ex - actly what people meant when they called
Germany	LOCATION	a nation of poets and philosophers .

		Germans have always exhibited a curious as - surance that the Lord is with them , and that their will is His .

		It did n't particularly matter what they did , they always had a system of philosophy to prove that it was inevitable , that the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	meant that and nothing else .

		Think of Kant with his obligatory moral law ' within . '

		Think of Fichte with his metaphys - ical demonstration that the German people were intended by the Lord to be a cultured nation .

		What is the whole romantic movement but an eristical exhibition of how the uni - verse conspires with the romanticist 's whim - sies ?

		I remember reading an article by some American professor about the compensatory nature of ideas .

		I gathered that some sort of law operates which keeps men neutralizing un - pleasant facts with pleasant fancies , ideas in dreams , ideas in art and literature , ideas in philosophy .

		They sort of balance our accounts with the universe , our wishes taking notes on the unseen and the non-existent for the visible existing world 's failure to pay .

		When roman - tic idealism flourished in
Germany	LOCATION	there were hundreds of small states and an infinite deal of local color .

		I suppose that the barren ex - panse and logical rigor of that way of think - ing , a way of thinking which makes all 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	things the same as your Absolute self , was a compensation for the pleasant grubbiness and provinciality and disorder of the actual daily life .

		It is all the same in the Absolute . '' ''

		But what has all that to do with the war and Verboten and f rightfulness ? ''

		interposed
Kurt	PERSON	. ''

		Why , this .

		So long as the Kantian ' moral law ' was ' within / so long as the Absolute was an obligation in idea , it was a word , an ideal , and conspired with the individual to keep him free , expanding his imagination and saving him from provincialism .

		But thanks to
Hegel	PERSON	, the word was made flesh and dwelt on earth ; the ideal became an idol . ''

		`` To Hegel ? '' ''

		Yes .

		Do n't you remember the peroration of his philosophy of history ?

		It describes the Prussian monarchy as Absolute Reason incar - nate , identifies it with the highest perfection which rational evolution , as history , could attain .

		Conservative , orthodox , wordy , and pro-Prussian ,
Hegel	PERSON	is the real master of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of all the consequences of his teachings and they are legion modern
Germany	LOCATION	is thus far the most efficacious .

		His way of thinking dominated
Europe	LOCATION	for two generations .

		It was the official philosophic orthodoxy of my student days , approved by the powers that be because it made them the Absolute 's local habitation and name .

		It justi - fied things as they were .

		It rationalized acquiescence in Prussian aggression between '60 and
' 80	DATE	, and made easy the complete
Prus	PERSON	- sification of
Germany	LOCATION	in the
'80s	DATE	.

		There had been , for various reasons , an interval of over twenty years between my first and second jour - ney to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		I have since returned there every
summer	DATE	; but the shock of that first re - turn repeats itself .

		The picturesque dirt and the jolly disorderliness were gone ; streets were clean and policemen plenty .

		The simplicity , the kindliness , and the democracy were gone ; the freedom of movement was gone , so was , really , the freedom of thought .

		The universi - ties and schools had been centralized ; ad - vancement was dependent upon a ministry to whom your teaching must be satisfactory ; and if you were heterodox on any matter remotely connected with politics there was no hope for you .

		Everything else was like that , too , the press , commerce , the church .

		And the police - system , passports , surveillance , reports !

		On all sides you were hemmed in with taboos , and if you expostulated you were met with an inexorable Verboten .

		All you could do was to swear in the privacy of your bedroom , to kick the cat , or to get drunk .

		Verboten was the moral law , the absolute reason , turned into a visible and audible fact . ''

		The new generation which had grown up with it had grown up swearing , kicking the cat , getting drunk ; the present generation is doing the same thing on the battlefield in a more exaggerated way , but the same thing .

		The new art , the new literature , the new eroticism and individualism , these are but the relief of swearing , the expression in idea of these traits which the Prussified social and political order repressed in fact .

		Transcen - dental Egotism has given way to personal selfishness , to bumptiousness , to vanity ; senti - ment and piety to subtle brutality toward women and to formalism in religion ; social responsibility to intense individualism and rivalries , most marked , perhaps , in academic circles .

		Year by year , as I returned , I found these things intensified as the ' moral law ' became more ` objective ' and Verboten more effective .

		Absolutism in fact had led to anar - chism in ideals :
Germany	LOCATION	was swearing and kicking the cat and getting drunk to beat the band .

		You know how the present generation swears by
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		And you know the Schrecklichkeit . ''

		`` But , '' interposed
Jacob	PERSON	, `` is n't
Nietzsche	PERSON	himself a cause of the Schrecklichkeit ? ''

		`` Nonsense .

		Nietzsche was nothing if not an individualist .

		He had no use for
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		If young
Germany	LOCATION	has turned to him , it is by way of compensation .

		Like the atrocities , his hold on young
Germany	LOCATION	's imagination is an effect , not a cause .

		He supplies young Ger - many with what Mr.
Robert Chambers	PERSON	sup - plies the shop-girl , a vicarious realization of repressed desire .

		The cause is the repression exercised by the ' moral law within ' turned into an outer fact .

		The cause is Verboten . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		FIFTY YEARS OF THE `` FORTNIGHTLY , '' the review that professes by its name to appear every two weeks , and did so for a year at its start , but has ever since unblushingly belied its title by coming out monthly , have been rounded out with proper acclaim , and the publication starts on its second half-century under notably favorable auspices .

		It is not .

		by the way , the first English periodical of its sort to be guilty of a certain absurdity in the matter of title .

		There was , for instance , '' The Prospective Review , '' called into being ten years earlier by
James Martineau	PERSON	and others , and not unnaturally made the target for some good-natured jibes by reason of the contradiction in terms conspicuous in its name .

		As the jubilee of the review now con -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 451 ducted by Dr.
Courtney	PERSON	is duly celebrated in the pages of that review , the reader is referred to those entertaining and instructive pages , to which it may be pertinent to add an appre - ciative word concerning its editor by a fellow - Oxonian .

		In his '' Twenty Years of My Life '' Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	writes : '' But of all the men who were at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	with me , no one has been so prominent , then and now taken to - gether , in intellectual circles as
W. L. Court	ORGANIZATION	- ney .

		Courtney was then a rather young New College don , who had the distinction of being married to an extremely smart-looking wife .

		That would have been a distinction by itself in the Oxford of that day , for few were mar - ried in a way suitable to impress under - graduates .

		Added to that , he cut the most eminent figure in athletics of any don in
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		He was the treasurer of the Uni - versity Boat Club , while the dons respected him as the ablest man in
Oxford	LOCATION	at philoso - phy ... His influence on literature has been immense .

		He has stood for the combination of scholarliness and up-to-dateness .

		His own books range from essays on the verge of fic - tion to some of the most important works on philosophy published in a generation .

		Inci - dentally , the creator of Egeria is our best dramatic critic , and a writer of plays . ''

		Noteworthy is the fact , vouched for by Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	, that his review has gained rather than lost in circulation since the outbreak of the war and the consequent increased vogue of the daily newspaper .

		Repeatedly , he says , the `` Fortnightly '' has of late gone out of print on the fourth or fifth of the month ; and a similar experience is reported by other
London	LOCATION	monthlies of like standing .

		Evi - dently the daily journalist 's snap-shot views of current events do not suffice for all readers .

		LAXATIVE LITERATURE is both a cause and an effect of that general slackness and flabbiness that characterize , in varying measure , the im - perfect human nature of us all .

		This atonic quality in American literature and life re - ceives a sharp castigation at the hands of Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	in an article entitled '' Quack Novels and Democracy , '' which holds the place of honor in this month 's ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Espe - cially severe is he upon those present-day fiction-writers of whom he selects Mr.
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	as a typical example , upon the five million eager readers of such fiction , and upon that far more inclusive class of Amer - icans whom our
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	is thought by Mr.
Wister	PERSON	to represent .

		Slackness , heed - lessness , happy-go-lucky muddle-headedness , addiction to cheap sensationalism , a bland con - tent with sounding words and pretty phrases in place of disagreeable truths and stern reali - ties , and a general condition of self-complacent sloppiness these , or something like them , it appears , are conspicuous among our faults both as writers and readers and reviewers of novels , and as citizens of a supposedly self - governing State .

		The quack-novelist finds five million mouths watering for his '' mess of mil - dewed pap , '' and the quack-statesman easily commands many more than five million elec - tive votes .

		Our people revel in sham , and assiduously cultivate a squint to avoid seeing the truth .

		Dr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	's notable deliv - erance of six months ago on American fiction is made the text for some remarks not exactly flattering to most of those who write , those who read , and those who review , our works of fiction .

		Timidity and lack of discrimination are charged against the literary reviews , of which the more respectable '' stand ever ready to be the first to hail a perfectly ivell established artist . ''

		The view of Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	upon which is premised so much of Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's article seems to us quite unjust and unwarranted , as are also his sneers at the very few American periodicals -LRB- most of which he mentions by name -RRB- that have at least endeavored to main - tain discriminating standards in the appraisal of current fiction .

		Occasionally in his article , also , Mr.
Wister	PERSON	proves that he is by no means an infallible critic himself , as in his aston - ishing remark about Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' The Dark Flower . ''

		But , in the main , his whole - somely harsh utterances ought to be , and must be , in some degree , tonic and bracing and curative .

		... TRAVESTY IN THE FORM OF FICTION is a legiti - mate variety of literary art , and is never liable to the severity of censure visited upon travesty that purports to be history or biography or travel or some other species of serious prose composition .

		Nevertheless , when the novelist puts forth a burlesque or a distortion in such wise as to cause it to be accepted seriously as something other than it is , he is guilty of a kind of disingenuousness , to say the least , that may stir just resentment .

		Such resentment has already been noted in these columns on the part of certain critical Irish readers of
Canon Hannay	ORGANIZATION	's imaginative portrayals of life and character in his native
Ireland	LOCATION	; and now there comes to notice , in the
Dublin	LOCATION	`` Leader , '' an outspoken though not intemperate protest against the caricatures that this popular writer -LRB- known to his readers as ''
George A. Birming	PERSON	- ham '' -RRB- has put his name to , more especially in some of his later books , as pictures of men and manners in the land of the shamrock and the shillelah .

		`` Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	, '' complains the 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	critic , '' albeit guiltless of the coarse misrepre - sentations of the past , has contrived to revive the expiring tradition of the Irishman in cap and bells , with enough wit to entertain others and insufficient to discharge his own obliga - tions .

		At the very moment when , having almost overwhelmed this preposterous tradi - tion , writers and dramatists and poets were conspiring to replace it by the industrious and attractive circulation of the truth , there broke in upon their patriotic efforts Mr.
Bir	PERSON	- mingham 's company of comedians .

		Their appearance was doubtless agreeable to Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	's pocket , but it has been singu - larly misfortunate for his reputation and for the dignity of his country 's literature . ''

		Re - gret is expressed for '' the degradation of Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	's art by the conscienceless de - mands of the English fiction market , '' and the writer laments the `` long descent from ` The Northern Iron ' to ' General
John Regan	PERSON	, ' and from so carefully written a book as ' The Seeth - ing Pot ' to the pot-boiling comicalities of ' Dr.
Whitty	PERSON	. ' ''

		One can understand and can sympathize with a tendency to yield to the temptation to be highly entertaining and pro- portionately successful , commercially , rather than to be less entertaining and less success - ful ; but the stern morality of the matter teaches that 't is a writer 's perdition to be popular when for the truth he ought to be unpopular .

		THE PERILS OP PLAYFULNESS , whether of the pen or of the tongue , lurk unsuspected on every hand . ''

		Set a watch , Lord , before my mouth ; keep the door of my lips , '' should be the humorist 's constant prayer .

		Grown per - sons who jest in the presence of children do so at their own risk .

		The comptroller of stamps , at that historic party in
Haydon	LOCATION	's rooms , whose '' phrenological development '' Lamb so earnestly desired to inspect , will stand as the type of man before whom it is dangerous to be other than altogether serious .

		Carlyle , it will be recalled in this connection , had little relish for lighter humor of the Elian variety .

		To him Lamb 's talk was `` contemptibly small , indicating wondrous ignorance and shallow - ness , '' and there was '' a most slender fibre of actual worth in that poor Charles . ''

		But be - tween Lamb and any Scotchman there never was much love lost .

		Not long ago there chanced to be printed in this department a paragraph ending with the phrase not in - tended to express an everlasting truth , but penned in lighter mood and , moreover , put into the mouth of a hypothetical man of let - ters `` the pen is mightier than the plough . ''

		An esteemed contemporary -LRB- the hackneyed term is used here without sarcasm -RRB- , from whom better things had been looked for , most unexpectedly and surprisingly pounced upon this little alliterative effort , censured with ponderous gravity the supercilious perpetrator of so wanton an injury against a worthy indus - try , magnanimously instructed him in his igno - rance that what he was dimly groping for in his comparison was the sword and not the plough , and delivered quite an improving lit - tle sermon on the usefulness and the dignity of agriculture .

		Not unnaturally , this stirred a desire to take candle in hand , as was done by Lamb on the occasion above mentioned , and , approaching the defender of the honest farmer , to accost him with the gentle humorist 's polite request , '' Sir , will you allow me to look at your phrenological development ? ''

		A PLEA FOR THE REVIVAL OF A MORIBUND ART , the art of reading aloud , was not long ago persuasively made by Mr.
Benjamin Ives Gil	PERSON	- man , Secretary of the
Boston	LOCATION	Museum of Fine Arts , before a gathering of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	librarians ; and his words have now achieved the permanence of print in the '' Bulletin '' of the
Massachusetts Library Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Gil	PERSON	- man suggests that a `` docent service '' be added to the public library 's equipment , sim - ilar to the docent service inaugurated at the above-named museum eight years ago and since widely adopted in other museums both in this country and in
England	LOCATION	.

		Personal aid , free to all , in the appreciative study of its art works is furnished by the museum , greatly to the visitor 's profit and pleasure ; and it is argued that a similar docent service in the library , consisting chiefly of the viva voce interpretation of great authors in their noted books , would help to make those authors , now too much neglected , alive and real and full of meaning to the library-users .

		The details of the scheme would have to be worked out with thought and labor and the instruction of expe - rience .

		On this head Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	says , among other things : '' It would evidently not be ad - visable to add the duty to the burdens , already heavy , of the library force itself .

		Readers should in general be chosen from outside the staff as a regularly accredited corps of assis - tants .

		To read aloud well is not a talent given to many ; and the choice of the corps would present difficulty .

		To those well fitted it would afford a new means , if not of livelihood , at least of adding to their earnings ; but great care would be needed to ensure that the reader should have a good voice , a pleasant delivery , and an intelligent and appreciative grasp of the particular work to be read . ''

		To his fur - ther pertinent remarks he might have added
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 453 that this proposed decent service is but the logical extension of the already tried and ap - proved children 's - story-hour service , though whether the addition is practicable or on the whole advisable still remains to be shown .

		THE BOOK-REVIEWER 'S CHIEF FUNCTION is re - viewing books a useful platitude lost sight of by the would-be reviewer who writes essays or diatribes or sermons or rhetorical treatises or philosophical disquisitions in the guise of reviews .

		A faithful portrait of the book , as Mr.
Eobert Lynd	PERSON	emphatically insists in a recent article on '' Book-Reviewing '' in '' The British Review , '' is what is primarily de - manded of the reviewer , not his personal likings or dislikings as aroused by the author .

		But , like a good portrait of a person , this representation of a book 's distinguishing quali - ties should be something more than an inven - tory of attributes , a table of measurements , a rogues ' - gallery record of individual peculiari - ties ; the vitalizing touch must make itself felt , the creative instinct should find play , even in so seemingly mechanical a task as reproducing in epitome the main features of a popular novel or a collection of essays or a work of history .

		This vitalizing touch can in many instances be attained by a discriminat - ing use of quotation and anecdote , by a suffi - cient admixture of the concrete example with the abstractions of literary criticism .

		But above all , as Mr.
Lynd	PERSON	well urges , let the reviewer present the purpose or motive of the book , and indicate as clearly as possible how far that purpose has been attained .

		If the author 's object is to justify matricide , no mere iteration , on the reviewer 's part , of the sacred - ness of the maternal relation , will constitute a review of the book .

		In other words , a due measure of self-suppression is of superlative importance in book-reviewing , as in every other worthy form of human activity .

		THE PRIDE OF AUTHORSHIP shows itself un - abashed in some authors , tries ineffectually to conceal itself in others , makes the same at - tempt with better success in still others , and is entirely unknown to the remainder so few in number as to be virtually negligible .

		Probably no eminent author has ever dis - played with more delightful frankness this species of self-complacency , which after all need be no more than a certain legitimate and desirable measure of self-respect , than the amiable Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table	ORGANIZATION	.

		A characteristic anecdote about him is told by Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	in his '' Twenty Years of My Life '' -LRB- which is reviewed on another page -RRB- , and it will be new to most readers .

		Contrasting
Meredith	PERSON	's dislike to be made the object of gushing compliments with Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's smiling submission to the same in - fliction , Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	tells of a lady whom he introduced to the affable American author , and who opened the interview thus : `` It must bore you terribly , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, to have everybody who is introduced to you telling you how they admire your books . '' ''

		On the contrary , '' was the gallant reply , '' I can never get enough of it .

		I am the vainest man alive . ''

		On the same occasion , the English chronicler adds , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	told him that he had been unable to do any literary work -LRB- except his `` Hundred Days in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -RRB- for years , be - cause all his time was taken up with answer - ing complimentary letters .

		OBSTRUCTIVE LIBRARY LAWS are worse than none .

		The Illinois Library Extension Com - mission calls attention , incidentally , in its latest Report , to certain provisions of the public library law of this State that might advantageously be repealed or amended .

		For instance , under the existing law the largest unit that may levy a library tax is the town - ship ; but there are seventeen counties in
Illinois	LOCATION	that have no township organization , and that have no villages large enough and wealthy enough to maintain libraries , so that the inhabitants , outside the cities having pub - lic libraries , are dependent on the very inade - quate travelling library system for most of their reading matter .

		A county library law is needed , and is asked for ; also a law , analo - gous to that governing the township high school , which would permit adjoining town - ships to unite for the support of a library .

		This would especially aid villages situated in parts of two townships and unable under pres - ent restrictions to maintain any sort of public library , whereas the combined resources of the two adjacent townships would suffice for the purpose .

		At the time of the issue of the Report hope was entertained that legislative action in the desired direction might soon be taken .

		A NEW DEPARTMENT OF STATE ARCHIVES is one of the by-products of militarism in Ger - many .

		With characteristic thoroughness the government has organized a '' film corps '' to procure cinematographic records of current military operations .

		Though some of these films will contribute to the edification of the masses , as represented by the frequenters of the moving-picture theatres , many will go to swell the '' film archives , '' already numbering more than two thousand '' reels . ''

		This graphic record of battles and other events and aspects THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	of the war is a thing wonderful in itself , how - ever fraught with lamentable significance , and points the way to future and worthier uses of the same method of preserving for all time -LRB- barring accidents -RRB- history in the process of making .

		Incidentally , the need will be em - phasized of fireproof buildings for archive purposes , unless some material indestructible by fire shall take the place of the present inflammable film .

		A CLASSIC AUTHOR IN HIS OWN LIFETIME , President
Wilson	PERSON	has the gratification of seeing one of his carefully prepared and de - servedly admired speeches adopted for educa - tional use as a model of choice English in the public schools of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The address in question is the one he delivered on the tenth of
May	DATE	before an audience of newly naturalized citizens in
New York	LOCATION	.

		From the reported utterances of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	school - teachers it appears that this action on the part of Superintendent
Jacobs	PERSON	has been heart - ily applauded .

		Cheerful acquiescence at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	is to be taken for granted , since next to the writing of a nation 's songs the privilege of contributing to its school reading - books must be held in high esteem ; and when the contributor also assists very conspicu - ously in making that nation 's laws , what a piling up of honors do we behold !

		COMMUNICATION .

		AN AGGRIEVED SHAKESPEAREAN COMMENTATOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a review of my book , '' Some Textual Diffi - culties in Shakespeare , '' published in your issue of
April 15	DATE	last , the writer repeatedly holds me up to scorn for referring to Nerissa as a '' maid '' in the sense of being a lady 's - maid or household subordi - nate .

		If there is a reader of THE DIAL who does not know that this was
Nerissa	ORGANIZATION	's position , let me suggest that before accepting the statements of this abusive review he refresh his memory by turning to some good commentator on Shakespeare or else by reading the play itself .

		The lines in question are as follows : '' My eyes , my lord , can look as swift as yours ; You saw the mistress , I beheld the maid . ''

		Shakespeare works by apposition mistress maid .

		Now if , as your critic claims ,
Nerissa	ORGANIZATION	is being referred to merely as an unmarried woman , and if she is not a household subordinate at all , then we have got to take the word applied to
Portia	LOCATION	in an apposite sense .

		We then have the lovely
Portia	LOCATION	being referred to as a '' mistress '' in that sense while she was as yet unmarried !

		As a matter of fact , your critic is so wholly engaged in finding fault with me , in four pages of vituperation , that he entirely fails to see the ridic - ulous straits into which his efforts are leading him .

		If he had any ability to read a line of Shakespeare this would have been impossible even though he had never read the play .

		He says there is '' no excuse '' for my taking Nerissa to be a '' maid '' in the sense that I do .

		Let us refer him to '' Familiar Talks on Some of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Comedies '' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	, 1897 -RRB- .

		`` Nerissa is a lady-in-waiting but somewhat kitchen-minded . ''

		Or again : ''
Nerissa	PERSON	, her lady-in-waiting , is quick - witted , kindly , and deeply attached to the sweet heiress , but throughout we feel her inferiority of nature to be greater than her inferiority of posi - tion . ''

		Everybody knows that .

		True enough ,
Nerissa	PERSON	was a woman of quality , but this did not prevent her from serving in such a position to the rich nobleman 's daughter .

		As to my `` excuse '' for calling the woman of quality a `` maid , '' I must point out that it is Shakespeare who chose the word .

		Your critic is finding fault with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		All his fine scorn must apply to the
Bard of Avon	ORGANIZATION	and not to me .

		He is equally wroth that I should call
Gratiano Bassanio	PERSON	's '' man . ''

		He will not allow a nobleman to be so traduced .

		But look at the above lines , where Gratiano addresses
Bassanio	PERSON	as '' my lord . ''

		Your critic evidently thinks that these words refer to
Bassanio	PERSON	merely as a nobleman , and that Grati - ano was equally a lord .

		Does he not know that
Bassanio	PERSON	took Gratiano along and paid his ex - penses ?

		In fact , it is necessary to the whole struc - ture of the play that these two lovers ,
Nerissa	PERSON	and Gratiano , should be subordinate to the mistress and master who were the principal lovers .

		Your critic not only does not understand the Shakespearean vocabulary but has no appreciation of the plot .

		Possibly , too , your readers would be interested in the following .

		The critic says , in summing up his view of one of my solutions : '' It is a pity that our author has omitted to specify to an admiring world in what respect a bullet or leaden messenger of death is invulnerable and unconquerable . ''

		The chapter he refers to , which occupies but three pages , is wholly engaged in showing , in as plain English as I know how to use , that it is the air which is unconquerable , invulnerable .

		I would not think of making such a claim as he attributes to me .

		It would be ridiculous .

		Is not the following plain English : `` And so ' still-peering air ' regards the atmosphere as always and ever the equal of these leaden missiles of war inconquerable , invulner - able '' ?

		As I have said , the chapter dealing with this crux occupies but three pages , and it makes it plain that I am referring to the air as invulnerable , even though the above quoted sentence were not clear .

		Can not your critic read the chapter he criticizes ?

		In dealing with one of my notes on '' Hamlet , '' this critic says : '' We challenge Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	to name a single editor , critic , or commentator who gives the above paraphrase of the Captain 's words . ''

		He is referring to my own interpretation or para - phrase .

		This is a peculiar remark to make about a book whose only object is to submit original inter - pretations .

		In other words , I write a book on those famous cruxes which have baffled commentators for
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 455 nearly two centuries , and I submit solutions which I think will clear up the difficulty .

		All solutions in the past have failed to satisfy , therefore I take up the work .

		Necessarily , if I am to satisfy the minds of commentators , it must be with some new insight .

		It would be folly for me to submit any of the stock theories which have all proved futile .

		And submitting such a solution I am met with the challenge to show that any other commentator had ever submitted the same interpretation !

		I should say not !

		It would be more in keeping for me to challenge Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, the reviewer , to prove that anyone ever had .

		I do not understand the type of mind that feels called upon to write this sort of book reviews .

		This Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, about whom I know nothing , '' challenges '' me .

		Why challenge me ?

		It is a critic 's function simply to review a book .

		Besides convicting me of '' unwarranted cock - sureness '' and '' longwindedness '' and `` juvenility '' and '' contempt , '' and using almost every sort of sarcasm and opprobrious epithet that could be worked into a four-page review , he speaks of my '' overloud thunderings in the index . ''

		As a matter of fact the little book has no foreword or preface or introduction of any kind .

		The index is simply two and one-half pages of alphabetically arranged reference to characters and subjects in the plays .

		The review is very misleading ; and it is so full of error that I could hardly straighten it out in a reader 's mind if I were to take twenty pages of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	.

		The best answer I can make to the critic 's challenge is the following : The book bears the imprint of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	and of
Oxford	LOCATION	, and is issued under the sponsorship of the
Elizabethan Club of Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Yale Press	ORGANIZATION	, of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, gave the solutions three months of painstaking consid - eration .

		It was referred to
Yale	ORGANIZATION	by the most eminent authority at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	which had not yet established its press .

		Previous to that , some of the solutions had been favorably commented upon by Shakespearean authority in
New York	LOCATION	.

		And not one of these do I know personally , nor have I ever met them .

		Your critic says , in accounting for my astound - ing presumption in explaining these cruxes , that I was probably led into it by '' the ill-advised flattery of friends . ''

		As a matter of fact I have lived for
eight years three	DATE	and a half miles from even the smallest town on a lake in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		I do not belong to a literary club nor have any literary associations ; nor was I , during the time I was devoting to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in contact with anyone capable of advising me or offering me any encouragement .

		And all the letters I received from publishers in the east discouraged and advised against my attempting such a work .

		It was re - garded as impossible ; and a work that would pay no profit under any circumstances .

		I mention this as showing how greatly a critic like Mr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum can be mistaken in passing upon authors .

		As to my presumption in undertaking explana - tions in which all critics have failed .

		The first solution which I made in '' Hamlet '' has already changed the text of that play .

		I refer to Polonius 's reply to the King in II. , 2 , 45 .

		I changed the wording in that line , explaining the reason ; and Professor
Neilson	PERSON	, of
Harvard	LOCATION	, whose ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition is recognized as the latest product of Shakespearean scholarship , asked my permission , through his publishers , to adopt my change in the line in '' Hamlet . ''

		In rendering it as I do , and according to the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, I am differing with every editor or commentator for two hundred years .

		But if my explanation at last makes the sense plain , and it is gladly adopted , am I to refuse to do such work simply because it is '' pre - sumptuous '' to differ with others ?

		Such a work as this will never pay in money ; and very slowly in fame .

		Criticism can neither hurt nor help the author .


CHARLES D. STEWART	PERSON	.

		Madison ,
Wis.	LOCATION	,
June 2 , 1915	DATE	.

		-LSB- After a careful perusal and consideration of Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's complaint about my review of his book , I can only say that I have nothing to retract from my criticism .

		He credits me , quite incorrectly , with the statement that
Nerissa	ORGANIZATION	is termed a `` maid '' because she is unmarried .

		He continually speaks of Nerissa as a maid in the modern sense of the word because he opposes her to Gratiano as
Bassa	LOCATION	- nio 's '' man , '' that is , servant .

		My objection to Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's comments was not because he refers to
Nerissa	LOCATION	as a lady 's maid but because he speaks of her as a servant .

		On p. 300 I pointed out that
Gratiano	ORGANIZATION	's word `` maid '' is not the same as Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's .

		In the passage quoted by Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	, `` mistress '' means a lady who rules or has control over a household , not one who employs servants ; and `` maid '' means a lady-in-waiting , a maid of honor .

		Nerissa 's service , like that of all maids of honor , was only technical .

		Gratiano 's ad - dressing
Bassanio	PERSON	as `` my lord '' no more proves he was the latter 's `` man '' than
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- sius 's addressing Brutus so proves Cassius to have been an underling .


Bassanio	PERSON	did not pay
Gratiano	ORGANIZATION	's expenses , Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	to the contrary notwithstanding .

		Moreover ,
Gra	ORGANIZATION	- tiano is not a nobleman , only a gentleman .

		Again , if the air is the equal of the leaden missiles of war in being unconquerable and invulnerable , I still want to know in what sense bullets are unconquerable and invulner - able .

		Finally , Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	very indignantly maintains that I refer to one of his own inter - pretations of a passage in '' Hamlet '' as if it - were the interpretation of the commentators .

		This is perfectly characteristic of his method .

		As to that passage , this is what Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	wrote : `` According to the generally accepted interpretation , the Captain is supposed to be saying , '' etc. .

		If his paraphrase is the gener - ally accepted one , it is not his , and I had a right to challenge him to name a single editor , critic , or commentator who so paraphrased the Captain .

		456 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	CROWDING MEMORIES or A TJITERARY LIFE .

		* As a magnet attracts iron-filings , so do some men acquire a multitude of interesting little experiences that come to them as naturally and abundantly as the filings to the magnet .

		Of such men , in the literary walks of life , is Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	, prolific and versatile author of innumerable books , extensive traveller in all the continents and some of the islands of the globe , shrewd and humorous observer of men and manners , and everywhere and always , apparently , what in the expressive slang of to-day would be called '' a good mixer . ''

		The persons of note whom he has not met and mingled with might almost be said to be not worth meeting , or such is the first impression received upon turning the very entertaining and , in no reprehensible sense , very personal pages of his omnium gatherum of reminis - cence and anecdote , '' Twenty Years of My Life . ''

		With almost excessive restraint as an autobiographer , he limits the systematic re - hearsal of his own life to a few short chapters , and devotes the bulk of his book to other peo - ple 's lives , or to some brief and characteristic snatches of them as they have come into juxta - position with his own .

		And yet he is frankly though inoffensively conscious of his own importance in the world wherein he moves , as appears in such passages as this from his open - ing chapter : `` At Cheltenham I was the most prominent boy of my time , and the prestige with which I came up from school gave me a certain momentum at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		So I went out to
Australia	LOCATION	with a very good opinion of Pub - lic Schools , of
Oxford	LOCATION	, and myself . ''

		His going to
Australia	LOCATION	was due largely to his father 's having a brother there , Sir
Charles Sladen	PERSON	, at one time prime minister of
Victoria	PERSON	and afterward leader of the
Upper House	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Constitutional Party	ORGANIZATION	in that colony ; and it was in the course of that early
Austra	LOCATION	- lian visit that Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	obtained admission to the bar and was appointed professor of modern history at the
University of Sydney	ORGANIZATION	, an appointment that came to him in conse - quence of his having received highest honors in history at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	a few years before .

		But one year in this academic chair was sufficient to convince him that it was not the seat exactly made to his measure .

		Though three volumes of verse had come from his pen and enjoyed as much local success as could have been ; * TWENTY YEARS OF MY LIFE .

		By
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		expected , he longed for the wider literary opportunities of his native
London	LOCATION	; and so in
1884	DATE	, with the sanguine outlook proper to his twenty-eight years , he returned to
England	LOCATION	and began in earnest the pursuit of literature for a livelihood .

		Some idea of his educational equipment may be gained from his own words referring to that early time , words that make one envy the fulness and accuracy of his classi - cal and historical knowledge .

		He says : `` As an author , I have found the education I was given and gave myself a very useful founda - tion .

		Those ten years I gave to the study of Latin and Greek and classical history and mythology were not thrown away , because I have written so many books about
Italy	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	, in which having the classics at my fingers ' ends made me understand the history , and the allusions in the materials I had to digest . ''

		Omnivorous and rapid in his reading , he had been able at
Cheltenham	LOCATION	, according to his own account , to read '' every book in the College library , '' besides being -LRB- with a generous use of capitals -RRB- '' Senior Prefect , Editor of the school magazine ,
Captain of Football	ORGANIZATION	, and Captain of the Rifle Corps / ' winner of '' the prize for the English Poem '' and many other prizes and four scholarships , and conspicuous in divers other respects that need not here be enumer - ated .

		With such a start in life , how could he have failed to attain eminence ?

		It is in the anecdotal pages devoted to other men that the author is at his best ; and the temptation to quote freely from those divert - ing pages is irresistible .

		But their wealth of matter is such that the enjoyment of the book itself will suffer no appreciable diminution by reason of this plagiarism .

		Opening the vol - ume in the middle , here is what we find set down in commemoration of the late witty
Henry Jeyes	PERSON	, journalist : '' His reputation as a wit came up with him -LSB- to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- from
Uppingham	LOCATION	.

		All Uppingham men could remember how , when he was caught cribbing with a Bible on his knee at a Greek Testament lesson , and his class-master had said to him tri - umphantly , ' What have you there , Jeyes ? '

		he said , ' A book , sir , of which no man need be ashamed , ' and how when Thring , the greatest head master of his time , had asked him how he came to be ploughed in arithmetic for his
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	cer - tificate , he replied from Shakespeare , ' I can not reckon , it befits the spirit of a tapster ' a readi - ness which Thring would have been the first to appreciate .

		`` Among the best things I remember him saying at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	are -LSB- sic -RSB- his definition of the Turks in a great debate over the Bulgarian atrocities , as a people ' whose morals are as loose as their trousers , and whose vices are as many as their wives . '

		And it was he who said , ' I do n't want to go to Heaven , because Gore -LRB- now
Bishop of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the only
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 457 Trinity man who will be there , and I 'd rather be with the rest . ' ''

		In another chapter occurs a passage giving the origin of a noted saying that has even more significance now than when it was uttered ; and the paragraph is interesting for other rea - sons also .

		Speaking of Mrs.
Margaret Woods	PERSON	, he writes : '' She was one of the few charming women that the monastic Oxford of that day contained .

		Her father , afterwards the famous Dean of West - minster , was master of
University College	ORGANIZATION	; I used to go to his Socrates lectures .

		He was dissatisfied with the progress we were making , and boldly it was very bold at Oxford charged us with paying too much attention to athletics , and it was then that he made his famous mot , that he had never taken any exercise in his life , except by occasionally standing up when he was reading .

		I have heard that it was equally true of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, but it was Dean
Bradley	PERSON	who said it .

		The Bradleys were an excessively clever family .

		The Dean had a brother or a half-brother a great philosopher , a don at
Merton	LOCATION	, and another ,
Andrew Bradley	PERSON	, a Fellow at
Balliol	LOCATION	, who became Professor of Litera - ture at another
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		I forget what his sister ,
Emma Bradley	PERSON	, did , but she was famous .

		Three of his daughters , Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	, Mrs.
Birch	PERSON	- enough , Mrs.
Murray Smith	PERSON	, are authoresses , Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	being one of the best novelists of the day , and in my opinion the best of all poetesses in the English language .

		When
Tennyson	PERSON	died there was a movement in favour of her being made the lau - reate , and no woman has ever had such claims for the post . ''

		Curiously interesting and rather character - istic of puzzling human nature is the fact that Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	, with so many other books of far greater literary worth to his credit , seems to take especial pride in his editorship of the first `` Who 's Who '' in its present form there had been an annual of that name in existence for half a century before he recog - nized , in
1897	DATE	, the splendid possibilities in its peculiar title .

		So great is his satisfaction in this product of his editorial industry that he calls himself , on the title-page to his present book , '' author of ' Who 's Who / '' and nothing more .

		In fact , he devotes a special chapter to the history of '' How I Wrote ' Who 's Who / '' Among the interesting things he tells us about the planning of the work we quote the fol - lowing : '' The idea of adding ' recreations ' to the more serious items which had been included in previous biographical dictionaries was adopted at one of the councils of war which we used to hold in the partners ' room of
A. & C. Black	ORGANIZATION	, at
4 Soho Square	ORGANIZATION	.

		And for selling purposes it proved far and away the best idea in the whole book , when it was pub - lished .

		The newspapers were never tired of quot - ing the recreations of eminent people , thus giving the book a succession of advertisements of its readability , and shopkeepers who catered for their various sports bought the book to get addresses of the eminent people , who were , many of them , very indignant at the Niagara of circulars which re - sulted . ''

		Of that sincerest form of flattery which the work has received in its many imitations in different countries , including notably our own , the complacent author rather strangely omits to make mention ; but he calls attention to some of the useful features that marked the English `` Who 's Who '' in his day , and that have since disappeared or suffered neglect , '' such as lists of peculiarly pronounced proper names , keys to the pseudonyms of prominent people , names of the editors of the principal papers . ''

		He adds : '' Some of the real names were so unreasonable that people wrote to know why they were not included in the lists of pseudonyms ; one of these was Sir Louis Forget . ''

		In his various wanderings Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	has , of course , visited this country more than once ; in fact , he has spent months at a time in Amer - ica , and he knows our celebrities nearly as well as those of his own land .

		From his memories of our distinguished men we select a passage concerning one of the most famous : ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	, though he was such a typically American writer , spent all the latter part of his life in
England	LOCATION	.

		I first met him at
Rudolph Leh	PERSON	- mann 's hospitable dinner-table .

		No one could fail to be struck with
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		He was so alert , so handsome , and though his plumes his hair was thick and sleek to the day he died were of an exquisite snow-white , he had a healthy , fresh-col - oured face , and a slender , youthful figure , always - dressed like a well-off young man ... He re - tained his vogue to the end .

		Any magazine would pay him at the rate of a couple of pounds for every hundred words .

		They used to say that the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	would accept his manuscripts as banknotes .

		He never failed to charm , whether he was telling some story at a dinner-party , or talking - to some undistinguished woman , young and beau - tiful or old and plain , who had asked to be intro - duced to him as a celebrity and a celebrity
Francis Bret Harte	PERSON	certainly was , for he founded a whole school in English literature . ''

		Very naturally and pardonably , a writer making such draughts on his memory as Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	, and writing so rapidly and copiously , commits minor errors of forgetfulness or of insufficient information .

		For instance , in the present volume , he makes John Hay ''
Harri	PERSON	- son 's Secretary of State , '' and , confusing two of our public men , of unequal prominence , he refers to `` the beautiful
Viva Sherman	PERSON	, an American nearly related to the Senator - Vice - President . ''

		Less excusably , he speaks of
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	as `` unable to translate from the original '' of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, though 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's published letters contain fre - quent mention of his Persian studies under Professor
Cowell	PERSON	's encouragement , and he made some notable translations -LRB- not always literal , it is true -RRB- from
Jami and Attar	PERSON	as well as from Omar .

		The illustrations to the book , by the Japa - nese artist , Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, deserve more than perfunctory mention .

		Both his exquisite colored drawings and his oddly effective por - trait sketches are masterpieces in their pecu - liar kind , and would suffice by themselves to give character to the volume .

		Character , how - ever , seems not to be lacking to its author , whose rambling but never tedious chapters will furnish more entertainment to the great public of '' general '' readers than almost any other book of the season .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		JUSTICE FOR THE INDIAX .

		* Mr.
Moorehead	PERSON	is a well known student of American archaeology , and most of his writings have been in that field .

		To his efforts is due the only department of American archaeology in a preparatory school in the
United States	LOCATION	that of
Phillips Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Andover	LOCATION	.

		He has also for years been an active member of the
United States Board of Indian Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	, and in that capacity has visited many of the Indian reservations and has participated in investigations of conditions in them .

		The present book is a result of this latter activity .

		The author calls it '' a plea for justice , '' and every reader will recognize the earnestness of the pleader and the urgency of his cause .

		Thousands of Americans have been stirred by the reading of
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	's `` Century of Dishonor , '' that powerful appeal to con - science ; most of those thousands have ex - pressed regret and horror at the story , and have then gone their way placidly , feeling that there was no remedy for the matter , that the damage was irretrievable , that all was past and what was done could not be undone .

		But the fact is that wrongs against the Indians have continued and still continue , and the well - meaning thousands are as unconscious of them as they are of the happenings on Mars , less conscious of them than they are of atrocities in
Armenia	LOCATION	or
Russia	LOCATION	.

		These same people shuddered over highly colored reports of
Congo	LOCATION	horrors , and contributed their dollars to aid `` reforms '' there , but were oblivious to the facts at
White Earth Agency	ORGANIZATION	and in
Okla	LOCATION	- homa .

		Yet there is nothing in
Helen Hunt	PERSON	* THE AMERICAN INDIAN IN THE UNITED STATES , 1850-1914 .

		By
Warren K. Moorehead	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	Illustrated .


Andover	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	:
The Andover Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Jackson 's book worse than these nothing in
Armenia	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, or
Congo	LOCATION	that is more brutal and cruel .

		Mr.
Moorehead	PERSON	has not the pen of Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	, nor her sense of art and style ; but his plea for justice is as real , and his facts , many of them personally gathered at their source , are convincing .

		Such things as he narrates are to be expected at the fringe of civilization .

		Men separated from home and all restraints , men living as traders or administrators under trying condi - tions of climate and life , men whose daily life is in a sense piracy or exploitation of a differ - ing people , men whose nights are filled with dangers from savage foes , such men will at times deal unjustly with natives .

		But
Minne	PERSON	- sota and
Oklahoma	LOCATION	of to-day are not the fringe of civilization .

		The men who there sin against justice and decency are not outcasts , isolated and removed from proper influences .

		They are American citizens ; they are men in business and professional life , lawyers , real-estate dealers , county officials , bankers , capitalists , legislators ; they not only know how to read and write , they are respected , they attend churches , they mould opinion , they are leaders in their communities .

		Yet , for the sake of money , they are blind to law .

		commit crimes , debauch and degrade their victims that they may plunder and rob .

		It is a story so inde - scribably sad that it seems almost unbelievable .

		Nothing more clearly show 's the breakdown of our educational system , the failure of our schools to develop moral fibre and to produce men , than
White Earth	LOCATION	and
Oklahoma	LOCATION	.

		Can we really see nothing but the dollar ?

		Are we without heart and conscience ?

		Have we no sense of decency , and is individual honesty forever gone ?

		The dreadfulness of the case is not merely that there are thousands among us who do such crimes , it is that they do them without general reprobation and execration .

		They are culpable ; but the community that can be in ignorance , or being informed can hold its peace , is equally to blame .

		We have spoken of
White Earth	LOCATION	and
Oklahoma	LOCATION	because they are striking cases , which have been con - spicuous on account of investigations ; but they are only special instances among many .

		Injustice is the rule , and in every place where we have Indians , Mr.
Moorehead	PERSON	gives details covering a wide field .

		He points out mistakes past and present , and warns us of the future .

		We are threatened as a nation with a more serious Indian problem than we have ever had .

		The Indian to-day is being individualized and , in the process , depraved and pauperized .

		He has never been a pauper and a public charge ; he is sure to become so unless he is given jus - tice .

		He is to-day impoverished , diseased ,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 459 degraded .

		It is a suggestive fact that the Navajo are to-day the only considerable body of true Indians remaining who are in fair health and prosperity and with good outlook if left alone .

		They are practically the only ones who have been left to follow their own free and natural life .

		All writers draw a contrast between the situation of Indians in the
United States	LOCATION	and those in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		In what are they different ?

		That there is a difference proves that contact between two races does not inexorably lead to such a condition as we have .

		Has the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian white man higher ideals than we ?

		Is he more honest , more just ?

		Or is it a mere ques - tion of dollars , and is he less hungry for gold than we ?

		In speaking of Canadian policies regarding Indians , Mr.
Moorehead	PERSON	says : '' Mr.
Duncan C. Scott	PERSON	, who holds the office in
Canada	LOCATION	corresponding to our
Commissioner of Indian Affairs	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		showed us a few thin pamphlets all the regulations , laws , statements , methods of procedure , etc. , necessary in the management of Canadian Indian affairs .

		With us we employ skilled lawyers to fathom the intent of our legisla - tors .

		They must delve into thousands of pages of conflicting laws , rules and statutes .

		And after one set of attorneys have presented their views , the mass of legal rulings is so enormous and compli - cated that other attorneys assigned the same task usually arrive at exactly opposite conclusions from those presented by the first corps !

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	also informed us that when a white man marries an Indian woman in
Canada	LOCATION	, he has no part in tribal or individual property .

		The government issues no deeds to Indians , but they live on their farms as do our own .

		All incentive to graft is removed .

		The simple , effective , Canadian management of Indian affairs , compared with our ponderous , complicated and ignorant handling of the same class of people in this country , points a very strong moral . ''

		As a people we claim to excel in honesty and in practical business sense .

		The condition of our Indians to-day gives the lie to both claims .

New York	LOCATION	:

		SONGS OF

		Translated by
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	.

		With Introduction by
Evelyn Underbill	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tagore has since translated a number of his representative books into English , in which the finer harmony of prose has been rendered with a sensitiveness and refinement rare in our Western literature .

		But as a man he has remained shadowy to us .

		And inasmuch as circumstances have made him in some sort an ambassador of the East to the West , we have come to desire a larger body of biographical fact concerning him , as well as an account of his place in the traditions of his own land .

		To fill this need we now have two biogra - phies : one by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, a friend of the poet , and temperamentally fitted to appre - ciate him ; the other by Mr.
Basanta Koomar Roy	PERSON	, a fellow countryman who is endeavoring to make his native land better understood in
America	LOCATION	.

		Both biographers have gathered their information at first hand , and so have made their books authoritative ; but Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	, partly because of his style and partly because of his merely appreciative and interpretative role , has given no very definite outline to the character of the poet and mystic .

		Mr.
Roy	PERSON	has been more conscious of the difficulties in inter - preting the East to the West , and has main - tained a more critical poise throughout his book .

		The impression we derive from Mr.
Roy	PERSON	's volume is of a personality of rich charm and great activity .

		Tagore 's varied career as man - ager of his father 's country estate , as poet , musician , essayist , dramatist , novelist , editor , national leader , and finally as educator , seems to us too prolific and energetic to be truly Oriental .

		Moreover , quotations from his let - ters prove him a keen observer and thinker , with decided opinions on such dangerous sub - jects as feminism , education , and the defects of Americans . ''

		Tagore is a voracious reader .

		Every month he buys many books on litera - ture , philosophy , economics , politics , sociology , and history .

		He reads them all . ''

		He is not ascetic or soured . ''

		He loves the world as passionately as a miser loves money . ''

		It is reassuring to the Western mind to find a spir - itual hero so human , a seer so practical and near .

		To rehearse the main incidents in the quiet life of Tagore is not necessary ; they have been known since the publication of `` Gitan - jali '' with Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's introduction .

		But in the full account of the poet 's career given in Mr.
Roy	PERSON	's book , it is interesting to look for important points of contact with the romanti - cism of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Thus we read : '' The realistic love poems of
Tagore	PERSON	's youth shocked many old-fashioned Hindu moralists , who received them with disdain .

		They were up in arms against Rabindranath , thinking that he was likely 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	to demoralize the youths of
India	LOCATION	by the sensuous - ness of his love poems and songs .

		They were afraid that he was going to introduce the romanti - cism of the West , of
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, in
India	LOCATION	, and to depart from the classic serenity of Indian literary treatment of the human passions . ''

		In his love of nature , also , he wins at once the sympathy of those who have been nour - ished on
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		How near he ap - proaches the nature worship of European romanticists may be seen from a letter written in his youth from a house-boat on the
Padma River	LOCATION	, where he was superintending his fath - er 's estate : '' Truly , I love this
Padma River	LOCATION	very dearly , it is so wild , so undomesticated .

		I feel like riding on its back and patting it caressingly on its neck ... I no more like to take a part before the footlights of the stage of publicity .

		I rather feel like doing my duty in silent solitude amid these transparent days that we have here ... Here man is insignifi - cant , but nature great and imposing .

		The things we see around us are of such a nature that one can - not create to-day , mend to-morrow and throw them off the day after .

		These things stand permanent , amidst birth and death , action and inaction , change and changelessness .

		When I come to the country - side I do not look upon man as anything separate '' from nature .

		Just as rivers flow by through many strange lands , similarly the current of humanity , too , is incessantly following its zig-zag path through dense forests , lonely meadows , and crowded cities , always accompanied by its divine music .

		It is not quite right to make the river sing , 1 Man may come , man may go , but I go on forever ' for man , too , is going on forever with his thou - sand branches and tributaries .

		He has his one end attached to the root of birth , and the other to the ocean of death both enveloped in the mysterious darkness ; and between these two extremes lie life , labour and love . ''

		Such evidences of parallel movements of romanticism in the East and the West seem even more conclusive when we read that ''
Raja Ram Mohun Roy	PERSON	, the father of modern
India	LOCATION	, introduced an age of reform in
India	LOCATION	.

		Well versed in the literature of the
East	LOCATION	and of the West , he strove to unite the cultural life of both for mutual benefit .

		With his towering genius he handled the social , political , relig - ious , and literary life with the hand of a master ... At his death , he left a unique worker as his intellectual descendant , De-ben - dranath
Tagore	PERSON	, the father of Rabindranath . ''

		Frequently
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	is praised for uniting the wisdom of the East and the West , and so being able to see the defects of both .

		One begins to wonder if the whole national renaissance of
India	LOCATION	was due to European stimulus .

		But the Hindus see that materialism and luxury are dominant in our civilization , and by their clear vision are defended against our influence . ''

		I am afraid , '' wrote
Tagore	PERSON	, `` that the present-day civilization of
Europe	LOCATION	is imperceptibly extending the arid zone in its ' social life .

		The super-abundance of luxuries is smothering the soul of the home home that is the very abode of love , tenderness , and beneficence a thing that is , above all , most essential for the healthy development of the human heart .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	homes are disap - pearing and hotels are increasing in number . ''

		In a letter he once wrote that '' as the streets in the European cities are made of hard stone , brick and mortar , to be made fit for commerce and transportation , so the human heart be - comes hardened and best suited for business .

		In the hard pavement of their heart there is not the slightest opening for a tender tendril , or a single blade of useless grass to grow .

		Everything is made bare and strong . ''

		Contact with European civilization has , of course , had a liberating influence on Tagore .

		But his true antecedents are members of the great poetical and religious tradition of
India	LOCATION	.

		In his poetry of nature he was deeply influ - enced by the Vaishnava poets of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , '' even though , '' says Mr.
Roy	PERSON	, `` in the poems of Tagore the love fervour of the Vaishnava poets fades a little . ''

		In his devotional and religious poetry he was profoundly influenced by
Kabir	PERSON	,
Chandidas	LOCATION	, and
Joy Dev	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the translations which he himself has given us of the songs of
Kabir	PERSON	, the fifteenth century mystic and poet , we find the same religious universalism , the same accep - tance of actual life , as in the work of Tagore .

		Kabir was a
Mohammedan	DATE	youth who was admitted to discipleship by the great Hindu teacher
Ramananda	PERSON	, even though a Mohamme - dan , a weaver , a simple and unlettered man .

		`` Hating mere bodily austerities , he was no ascetic , but a married man , the father of a family a circumstance which Hindu legends of the monastic type vainly attempt to conceal or explain and it was from out of the heart of the common life that he sang his rapturous lyrics of divine love . ''

		This disregard for the letter of the law , however , is not popular in
India	LOCATION	, and the religious songs of Tagore are not the songs of the masses . ''

		The masses have no comprehension of the
Brahmo Somaj	PERSON	the religious Unitarians of Hindusthan ... One might sing
Tagore	PERSON	's religious songs to a Bengali farmer , but he would listen unmoved ; and might even ask the singer to stop if he happened to detect it to be a Brahmo song .

		The orthodox hatred for Brahmo disregard for Hindu mythology is very intense . ''

		It is interesting to note from Mr.
Roy	PERSON	's book that admiration for Tagore is much more criti - cal and reserved in
India	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	and
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 461
America	LOCATION	.

		His countrymen admit his great - ness , but not that he is the greatest
Bengali	PERSON	poet for many centuries , as is sometimes nastily said .

		One literary Bengali in
America	LOCATION	commented : '' If Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	had ever at - tempted to write profound books like '
Raiba	PERSON	- tak ' or '
Kurukshetra	LOCATION	' of
Nabin Chandra Sen	PERSON	, his lyric brain would have burst before finish - ing even one canto of either . ''

		Another said : '' His love lyrics are poor imitations of the poems of our Vaishnava poets of old , and his philosophy is the philosophy of the
Upani	LOCATION	- shads .

		Let the Europeans and the Americans rave over
Tagore	LOCATION	.

		But there is nothing new for us in his writings . ''

		Tagore himself pleads guilty to dabbling with too many things : '' I am like a coquettish lady that wants to please all her lovers , and is afraid to lose a single one .

		I do not want to disappoint any of the Muses . ''

		Nevertheless `` no other lit - erary man in
Bengal	LOCATION	has done so well in so many things .

		Even the most adverse critics of Tagore are bound to admit that he has adorned every department of Bengali litera - ture by his transcendent genius . ''

		.

		Pie has become a representative , especially in poetry , of the Bengali renaissance which is saving the classical culture of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		He was needed in
India	LOCATION	as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	was needed in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Shakes	LOCATION	- peare in
England	LOCATION	, and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		In seeking to define and estimate the signifi - cance of
Tagore	PERSON	for the West , it is interesting to recall that poetry had been drifting in the direction of mysticism before
Tagore	PERSON	became known to us . ''

		These lyrics , '' wrote Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	in his preface to '' Gitanjali , '' '' display in their thought a world I have dreamed of all my life long . ''

		Poetry had sought to become a symbol , a musical suggestion .

		And so we were prepared to understand an art which proceeds , not by definition and outline , after the Greek manner , but by suggestion and sym - bolism .

		But it is out of the question that the main body of our poetry and art should ever become merely suggestive and mystical ; the hold of the Greek spirit on us is too great ; Phidias and Plato make us afraid of intellec - tual twilight , of emotional dissipation .

		In one respect , however , the literature and life of the Orient are a deep challenge to our civilization . ''

		If I work in my garden and prune an apple - tree , '' wrote
Emerson	PERSON	, '' I am well enough entertained , and could continue indefinitely in the like occupation .

		But it comes to mind that a day is gone , and I have got this precious nothing done . ''

		It is characteristic of our civilization , however , that we continue the activity without reflecting upon its vacuity .

		`` We are not happy unless active .

		Hindu poetry should reveal to us that the lack of a core of thought accounts for the fatuity of our religious efforts , the charlatanism in our cul - ture , the restlessness and materialism of our life .

		`` You people over here , ''
Tagore	PERSON	once remarked to Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	, '' seem to me to be all in a state of continual stj ^ fe .

		It is all strug - gling , hard striving to live .

		There is no place for rest , or peace of mind , or that meditative relief which in our country we feel to be needed for the health of our spirits . ''

		When - the
Nobel Prize	ORGANIZATION	was awarded to him , he gave all the money to his remarkable school at
Shanti Niketan	PERSON	; but , overwhelmed by pub - licity , he wrote , '' They have taken away my shelter . ''

		This handbook is planned for use in conjunc - tion with the meetings of the American Asso - ciation for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	to be held in
August	DATE	of this year in connection with the
Panama-Pacific International Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume will , however , be of value long after the palaces by the Golden Gate have van - ished into memories , for it is an epitome of the enduring natural phenomena of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Though professedly written for the scien - tific traveller , it is not a technical treatise for specialists , but rather a presentation by specialists , each of his own field , for the use and enjoyment of all the others .

		It is there - fore largely freed of technicalities wherever possible , and condensed to a minimum space .

		Would that all books of information were as innocent of superfluous padding !

		It is rather a rich mine of information tersely told , with - out effort to adorn or to exploit the resources of this interesting land for the tourist or the prospective purchaser of town lot or orchard .

		It seeks merely to direct the attention of the intelligent traveller to those physical features of the
Coast	ORGANIZATION	which it may be worth his while to understand .

Mary Moreland	PERSON	'' is per - haps the best example of her work , and it is easy to see why it must prove attractive to readers and hold their attention .

		Mary is a young woman of exceptional poise and strength of character , employed as a stenog - rapher by a Wall Street financier .

		For five years she has served him , and during all that time he has been making more or less conscious comparisons between her and the nagging , jealous , worldly w r oman who is his wife .

		When domestic ructions have brought him to the breaking-point , he determines to cut loose , and appeals to Mary to go off with him .

		She almost yields , but is recalled to her better self at the last moment , and declines to enter into the illicit arrangement .

		She is torn by the conflict between love for her employer and the promptings of a conscience which will not let her forget the sanctity of the marriage-bond , and the social necessity of preserving even such parodies of the home as
Maughm	ORGANIZATION	's estab - lishment .

		She not only succeeds in resisting temptation , but she actually figures as a recon - ciling influence between
Maughm	PERSON	and his wife .

		In the end , she comes to her own in conse - quence of the wife 's death in childbirth .

		A secondary plot is provided by the fortunes of a girl friend who has loved not wisely but too well , and who is saved by
Mary	PERSON	's influence from making a still greater mess of her life .

		The remaining characters of importance are Romney , an invalid English man of letters whom she serves for a time as amanuensis ; a
Colorado	LOCATION	mine-owner who takes her into the bosom of his family , and her mother , an in - credibly vain , selfish , irresponsible woman with a tincture of nauseating religiosity , whom Mary supports and almost loves despite her sordid scheming and inhuman ingratitude .

		All these characters are interesting , yet we feel bound to .

		The facets which reflect them to us are separately brilliant , but are cut according to a plan which does not bring out a symmetrical design .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 463 dialogue and the incidental matter , which present us over and over again with features which do not fit together , or are without adequate motivation .

		This element of incon - gruity is felt as a disturbing presence through - out the work .

		The American business woman is again to the fore in Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	's '' The Honey Bee , '' but this time she is presented to us in a far more profound and subtle portraiture than is within the range of
Miss Van Vorst	ORGANIZATION	's powers .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	's previous performances in fiction have , indeed , given us no reason to expect from him so profound a psychological study and so genuine a creation of character as he here affords us .

		There is no romantic glamour in `` The Honey Bee , '' and little sentiment , but there is a great deal of convincing truth , which is a much more preservative quality .


Hilda Wilson	PERSON	, to begin with , is upwards of thirty , an age which does not appeal to the romantic taste , although it is the age found best worth while by many of the greatest novelists , from
Balzac	LOCATION	to
Meredith	LOCATION	.

		She is a department man - ager in one of the great
New York	LOCATION	merchant establishments , and she has made good in her many years of service .

		A part of each year she acts as a foreign buyer , and it is in
Paris	LOCATION	that we make her acquaintance , and pursue her fortunes during the year over which the time of the novel extends .

		Somewhat fagged , and feeling that she is going stale , she accedes to her employers ' solicitations that she take a long rest , but , instead of employing her months of business leisure in a restful way , she remains in
Paris	LOCATION	, and falls into a set of new associations and interests that take her far out of her wonted habits of thought and action , stir in her unsuspected instincts and emotions , and give her rich new experiences that broaden her character , and bring her to Something of that self-realization which is , or should be , the purpose of every human soul worth saving to achieve .

		These experiences concern a little group of people with whom
Hilda	PERSON	becomes accidentally associated , and from whom she learns to know aspects of life that have before been entirely unfamiliar .

		They include `` Blink ''
Moran	PERSON	, an American prize-fighter ;
Adele Rainey	ORGANIZATION	, a variety-show dancer ; a weak and vicious youth who is her dancing partner ; and the illegitimate baby child of a French danseuse , who is herself in the hospital .

		Hilda moves into quarters with these people , takes
Adele	ORGANIZATION	under her protection and the baby under her care incidentally saving the life of the latter by hygienic pre - cautions and scientific feeding and becoming personally very much interested in
Moran	LOCATION	.

		The author portrays
Moran	PERSON	so sympathetically that we respect him -LRB- as
Hilda	PERSON	does -RRB- despite his profession , and the scene of the great fight for the international championship is de - scribed with so much vigor and dramatic color - ing that it is one of the best things of its kind we have ever encountered in fiction .

		Hilda is even stirred to think of
Moran	PERSON	as a possible husband , and the author 's skill almost per - suades us that we might contemplate without dismay such a disposition of his heroine ; but
Hilda	PERSON	's practical good sense comes to her rescue , and sets her to making a match be - tween
Moran	PERSON	and
Adele	ORGANIZATION	, which is far more fitting and reasonable .

		What contributes materially to
Hilda	PERSON	's decision is the memory of
Harris Doreyn	PERSON	, a man of large affairs who had employed her many years before , whom she had loved , and to whom she would have given herself had he not been already married .

		When
Hilda	PERSON	has cut herself loose from all these Parisian complications , she goes to Lon - don , and there Doreyn once more comes into her life , making her realize that she has never really ceased to love him .

		He is broken in health , and his one desire is to see
Hilda	PERSON	again , for which purpose indeed he has come abroad .

		They enjoy each other 's companionship for a time , and
Hilda	PERSON	, we are forced to believe , would in the end , had he lived , have defied the laws of society by living with him openly , so liberal an outlook upon life has she gained from her Parisian adventure .

		As it is , she is able to console his dying hour ; whereupon she returns to
New York	LOCATION	and takes her business duties once more upon her shoulders .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	calls his book '' the story of a woman in revolt , '' and we have seen that her revolt carries her to the brink of the precipice .

		It is morally inconclusive -LRB- like so much of life itself -RRB- , but , if we can only suspend the func - tion of moral judgment while we read , we shall not lack for variety of entertainment and deep human interest .

		Hilda and
Moran	PERSON	and
Doreyn	PERSON	are all genuine characters , and all make the strongest kind of an appeal to our sympathies .

		It is easy to be wise after the event , and any skilful practitioner in fiction could now pro- vide a prescient hero for a story of the great war .

		Such a hero is found in Mr.
Oppen	PERSON	- heim 's '' The Double Traitor , '' which tells us of an English diplomatic attache who clearly understood , in the months preceding
last August	DATE	, what has since been so patently dis - closed , and who did his best to persuade a reluctant officialdom that
Germany	LOCATION	was about to put into execution her carefully matured plan for embroiling the world in strife .

		Fail - ing in his appeal to deaf ears and the in - vincible prejudice of those who believed it 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	impossible for
Germany	LOCATION	to do exactly what she has done ,
Francis Norgate	PERSON	went to work on his own account to save
England	LOCATION	from the worst consequences of that wanton attack upon civilization .

		Having himself been dismissed from his post in the legation at
Berlin	LOCATION	, he posed as a man with a grievance , and became apparently the tool of one
Selingman	PERSON	, the head of the German spy - system in
England	LOCATION	.

		He seemed to be furnishing valuable reports to his employer , but they were framed only to deceive , and , as the critical day approached , he sought an interview with Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	, found in him a willing listener , and so impressed him with his revelations that an order was given for the immediate mobilization of the fleet .

		Thus does history become the handmaid of fiction .

		The scene in which Selingman is finally trapped and marched off to the Tower , after learning how successfully
Norgate	PERSON	has tricked him , is perhaps the most exciting that we owe to the author , accomplished purveyor of thrills though he be .

		The private romance of
Norgate	ORGANIZATION	and the
Baroness von Haase	PERSON	-LRB- of the Austrian secret service -RRB- makes a very acceptable love-story , but its interest is over - shadowed by the great affairs with which it is so intimately entangled .

		This capital story should make many new friends for Mr.
Oppen	PERSON	- heim .

		There would obviously be something lacking in these days in any survey of current fiction that did not include one or more war stories , and it is indeed likely that the war will be responsible for an output of fiction as far beyond that occasioned by any other war as this conflict exceeds all others in magnitude .

		The last issue of THE DIAL contains the ap - palling statement that in
Germany	LOCATION	alone the closing months of
1914	DATE	witnessed the publica - tion of one and one-half million new patriotic songs .

		The inference from this as to novel - writing throughout the world simply staggers the imagination .

		Upon the present occasion , aside from the ante-bellum invention just de - scribed , we have something to say about three new books of war-fiction , the first two of them being what the British public knows as '' shill - ing shockers , '' while the third is a far more serious artistic production .

		Mr.
Guy Thome	PERSON	is the author of `` The Secret Service Submarine , '' which tells how a schoolmaster on the
Norfolk	LOCATION	coast saved En - gland from a German invasion , and discom - fited as villainous a conspiracy of spies as ever existed even in the heated brain of a popular novelist .

		Says
John Carey	PERSON	, the hero , on page 147 , '' I am not going to describe everything I saw in detail .

		This is a story of action , and I always skip the descriptive parts in books , myself .

		The Johnnies only put them in to fill up . ''

		What he means is that he is not going to describe in detail , etc. , but that is unimpor - tant .

		He certainly makes good his claim that '' this is a story of action . ''

		Carey is an athlete with a game leg which unfits him for the active service of his country .

		Consequently , he be - comes a sub-master in a boys ' private school kept by one Dr. Up jelly , who is in reality the Graf von Vedal , a German spy of the most resourceful and dangerous sort .

		The school is situated on a lonely stretch of the
Norfolk	LOCATION	coast , and the enemy communicates with the conspirators by means of a submarine which creeps up an inlet close to the establishment .

		When the story reaches its climax , the hero kills Vedal , and then , aided by his brother , who is a British naval officer , and by two boys from the school , captures the German sub - marine by a ruse , kills its crew , and then , setting out for sea with the prize , intercepts and torpedoes a German war-ship which is convoying a number of transports for the invasion of
England	LOCATION	, sinks or puts to flight the transports , and covers himself and his com - panions with glory .

		All the parties concerned in this exploit get commissions and
Victoria	PERSON	crosses , and the hero gets besides Dr. Up jelly 's step-daughter , who has given valiant aid to the enterprise .

		Cheap as the story is in any literary sense , it is an undoubted thriller , and a notable example of swift melodramatic action .

		Mr.
Le Queux	PERSON	, who writes `` At the Sign of the Sword , '' is a man of parts , favorably known to readers of sensational fiction .

		The story is Belgian in setting , and takes us to the early days of the invasion of that martyred country , whose glorious achievement in mak - ing the outcome of the war a foregone conclu - sion almost from the start saved
Europe	LOCATION	from destruction , and won for the Belgian people a fame that will shine undimmed for many cen - turies to come .


Aimee de Neuville	PERSON	is the daughter of the richest man in
Belgium	LOCATION	, and is wooed -LRB- and prospectively won -RRB- by
Edmond Valentin	PERSON	, a young lawyer of little wealth but bright prospects .

		The villain is one
Armand Rigaux	PERSON	, an associate of
Baron de Neuville	ORGANIZATION	in large financial affairs , and in reality a secret agent of
Germany	LOCATION	, preparing to betray Bel - gium into the hands of the enemy .

		He pays his addresses to
Aimee	LOCATION	, with the encourage - ment of her father , but they are loathesome to her , and she repels him with scorn .

		Edmond , meanwhile , knows of
Rigaux	PERSON	's double-dealing , but a curious sense of honor forbids him to denounce his rival .

		When the storm bursts upon his devoted country , he takes his place in the ranks as an officer of artillery , while
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 465 Aimee hides herself in the family chateau on the Meuse near
Dinant	LOCATION	.

		The invasion of the Huns soon plunges her into the midst of the fray , and almost makes her a victim of their savagery , when the opportune appearance of
Edmond	PERSON	saves her from the worst outrage , and puts a highly fitting end to the arch - villain .

		After some days of storm and stress , with a piling up of horrors , and a series of hairbreadth escapes , the lovers make their way to
Ostend	LOCATION	, and find a safe haven across the Channel .

		We must quote one illustration of the author 's vigorous hard-hitting : '' The sun had set , and the red afterglow that crimson light of war was showing in the west over where lay
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the chief objective of the
Kaiser	PERSON	and his barbaric horde of brigands , hangmen , executioners , and fire-bugs .

		the men doing the bidding of that blasphemous antichrist who was daily lifting his hands to Heaven and invoking God 's blessing upon his hell-hound impie - ties . ''

		It makes a spirited tale , colored throughout with romantic sentiment .

		Whatever Mr.
Le Queux	PERSON	can not do , he at least can construct an effective plot , and carry it through with vigor and variety .

		Our remaining war novel is of a far more serious sort than the two just described , and belongs to literature as distinctly as they do not .

		^ It is entitled `` The Splendid Chance '' and is the work of Mrs.
Mary Hastings Brad	PERSON	- ley , already well known as the author of a sterling historical romance , `` The Favour of Kings '' ; an Egyptian tale of love and mystery , '' The Palace of Darkened Windows '' ; and in - numerable short stories .

		Mrs.
Bradley	PERSON	's hero - ine is a typical American girl , and .

		we first meet her as she embarks for
Europe	LOCATION	in the
spring of 1914	DATE	, with the intention of working in the art-schools of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		She comes from a
New England	LOCATION	college town , and is filled with artistic ambition .

		Among her fellow-passen - gers is an English army officer ,
Captain Edgerton	PERSON	, who cultivates her acquaintance , and gains with her a footing that promises romantic developments .

		This promise is later fulfilled when
Edgerton	PERSON	visits
Katherine	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	, and friendship ripens into love .

		Mean - while , we make the acquaintance in
Paris	LOCATION	of
Robert McNare	PERSON	, an American sculptor of genius , whose studio is just below
Katherine	PERSON	's rooms .

		McNare is the victim of an unfor - tunate marriage with a faithless wife , from whom he is divorced , retaining custody of the little girl who is all the world to him .

		He is a morose and unapproachable person as far as women are concerned , but
Katherine	PERSON	breaks down his defences when she devotes herself to
Peggy	PERSON	, and saves her life one dreadful night when she is attacked by croup .

		But McNare sees that his love is hopeless when
Edgerton	PERSON	appears upon the scene , and gnaws his heart out in silence .

		The stage is thus set for the real drama , which opens on the fatal First of
August	DATE	.

		This prologue , although it occupies half the volume , keeps us impatient for the appearance of the main theme , but it could not well be spared or even shortened .

		The tragedy that ensues is but one of millions bred of Ger - many 's wanton onslaught upon the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	, but it is set before us with such poignancy , such vividness , and such sympa - thetic grasp that it is made a typical crystal - lization of the whole horrible meaning of the great war .

		It takes us to the front in
Northern France	LOCATION	, when the invader has been driven back from the gates of
Paris	LOCATION	.


Katherine	PERSON	has given her services to the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and it becomes her fate to find
Edgerton	PERSON	lying on the battle-field , to receive his dying words of love , and to sit by his corpse in lonely vigil all night long .

		The pathos of this scene is well - nigh unbearable , and grips the heart as do few scenes with which we are acquainted in fiction .

		But the lesson of life is that no grief can utterly crush the spirit of youth , and after weeks of dumb agony made just possible to endure by the routine of her ministration to the wounded ,
Katherine	PERSON	returns to her
Paris	LOCATION	lodgings , and learns that McNare has been bereft of the sole joy of his life by a midnight bomb from the skies that has made his little
Peggy	PERSON	its victim .

		The two stricken mortals find what solace they can in their mutual sym - pathies , and
Katherine	PERSON	accepts McNare 's escort to
England	LOCATION	, where they spend some weeks in the peaceful Cotswolds .

		And one morning in
November	DATE	, when
Katherine	PERSON	, after a weary night , has risen before dawn , and climbed to the summit of a hill , life is sud - denly born anew in her , and the clan vital asserts its mastery over her shattered existence . ''

		Suddenly she felt herself strong and enduring , even as the earth was enduring , and in the ele - mental clay her spirit burned with a new fire ... She felt glad .

		Life was not all horror while it held love and beauty , and love was not gone while memory lived ... Her heart was not empty !

		It held priceless memories of love and courage .

		Bitter that
Jeffrey	PERSON	must be one of the martyrs in that struggle of the everlasting verities of freedom and right against undying stupidities and cruelties , but splendid for her that he had lived , that she had known him , that they had loved !

		She looked out over the world , fresh and beautiful , and though the irrecoverable beauty and freshness of her own life were gone , her splendid chance for perfect joy , she felt the indestructible forces of youth and life within her .

		And she knew that she would go on , and go on bravely and stanchly , not darkening a sad world with her grief , but drawing strength 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	from her memories , from her own soul , and from the strength of this nature , so impersonal , so en - during , so free of beauty . ''

		The chapter from which these quotations are made offers us at once the best writing and the most vital philosophy of the entire book .

		Nothing remains but a kind of epilogue in which the two return to
Paris	LOCATION	, and discover that it is still possible for them , in companion - ship with one another , to patch up their broken lives , and be of some use to the world . ''

		` You do n't know how much I want to give .

		How much there is to give / she said chokingly . '

		Of all people in the world , I I could begin again with you ... We 've borne enough of hurts .

		There are other ways of helping for us both .

		But do n't go out to fight with that hate in your heart !

		Not not yet not till they need you !

		We 'll help , we 'll spend our lives in helping ... but let it be now for the little children , the home - less ones for
Peggy	PERSON	's sake ... Oh , you 'll stav ?

		You 'll stay with mef '' This is the deft and natural solution found by the author for her extremely difficult emo - tional complication , and this is the ending of a very tender , wise , and beautifully written story .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		One reads rather dejectedly the earlier chapters of Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	's '' The Edge '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , sus - tained rather by the thought that the author has never been guilty of trifling with his readers than by any evidence of it at hand .

		The reward comes after this preliminary lightness has been passed , for the book turns to an attempt to solve the bitter problem which decent Americans confront who are trying to have children and bring them up accord - ing to right standards .

		As one goes on , it becomes apparent that the author is going down to the cause itself , and that he finds it in the lack of a religion that affords a workable rule of life seven days in the week .

		It can hardly be said that Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	mingles his propaganda with his fiction without loss to the latter , but he has nevertheless written a book that deserves reading .

		The problems arising from the passing of the old
New England	LOCATION	stock afflict the hero of Miss
Honore Willsie	PERSON	's '' Still Jim '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , who wishes to marry and have many children for the sake of perpetuating , with his family name , the ideals of the founders of so many of our best traditions .

		With this fundamental motive , Still Jim the qualifying adjective bespeaks his reticence enters the
United States Reclamation Service	ORGANIZATION	, and there accomplishes noteworthy results , chief of which is overcoming those qualities in himself which have retarded the realization among us of the old ideals .

		The book is interesting in many ways , with the element of romance well sustained .

		If American novelists have in the main fallen be - hind their brethren of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, we are still able to point to several writers of short stories on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	who may challenge com - parison with any abroad .

		Among these latter high rank must be given to Mrs.
Katharine Fullerton Gerould	PERSON	, whose second volume , '' The Great Tradi - tion and Other Stories '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , has now been published .

		It contains eight examples of short fiction , all but one bearing the same firm traces of masterly handling in much the same genre as char - acterized the author 's earlier book .

		The reactions of persons of high intelligence and developed senti - ment are set before the reader 's eyes recognizably and with an admirable power of analysis .

		Lovers of literary art will rejoice at this new evidence of Mrs.
Gerould	PERSON	's skill .

		Mystery without murder implicit in the main , situation , and with a solution more carefully con - cealed and less in the nature of things than in most books of the sort , characterizes '' Pals First '' ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Francis P. Elliott	PERSON	.

		What ap - pear to be a young escaped convict and an old clergyman who has served a term in an English prison for proved manslaughter descend as tramps upon a southern mansion .

		The young man is recognized by the old colored servants as their young master , and a highly elaborated scheme of deception follows .

		There is an amazing lack of good breeding in the supposedly cultured princi - pals , but the story moves well and there is a sense of fun in nearly every situation .

		The European element in modern
America	LOCATION	is widening our selection of literary topics .

		A few years ago such a book as Mr.
James Oppenheim	PERSON	's '' The Beloved '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- would have been thought impossible .

		It deals with a common girl , the daughter of nobody , and a young
New England	LOCATION	writer and poet just arrived in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Through his love she finds herself at the end with her better nature and ambitions awakened , and entered upon a career as one of the most popular of moving - picture actresses .

		The boy had to be sacrificed to bring her to self-realization , and the earlier steps in their intercourse are shown with a fidelity to fact which would have startled an earlier generation . ''

		Spray on the Windows '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- is a well considered story of life in a small English seaside town , written by Mrs.
J. E. Buckrose	PERSON	.

		It deals with the career of a girl who intends to bend life and love to her will , but who finds love too strong ^ With the selfishness of youth , she plans to marry well .

		Becoming the highly valued companion of an old family friend , she somewhat artlessly en - gages the affections of the old lady 's heir .

		But there has been a young neighbor , a man with whom fate has dealt hardly and unjustly ; and love beck - ons away from the ease she had longed for , and leaves her at the close of the book strong to work out a worthy destiny as wife and mother .

		Mr.
Richard Marsh	PERSON	writes good detective stories , but seldom stories of good detectives .

		In '' The Woman in the Car '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- the officers of the law , after spending three hundred closely printed pages in looking for the murderer of a prominent financier , have the questionable satisfaction of see - ing the financier enter their office for the purpose of telling them their mistake .

		There are two other
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 467 deaths in the progress of the tale , but the police arrive at no result with regard to either of them , one passing as suicide and the murderess giving herself up for the other .

		The story has all the complications that the most exigent reader could demand .

		As a thoroughly complicated mystery story , with the solution well concealed until near its close , when the tangled skein is unravelled after the manner of a complicated chess problem , `` A Silent Witness '' -LRB-
Winston	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
R. Austin Freeman	PERSON	, is to be highly recommended .

		It opens with the murder to which readers of such stories are accustomed , fol - lowed by a suspicious death , and these in turn by several calculated attempts upon the life of a young English physician of the rather impenetrable type usual in such cases .

		A fellow-practitioner , but one in the field of medical jurisprudence , is the brains of the case .

		Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	has turned her attention of late to stories of mystery , one
Fleming Stone	ORGANIZATION	being the
M. Dupin	PERSON	of her narratives . ''

		The White Alley '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the latest of these , and he brings a murderer to book by means of a boy 's mar - ble which , dropped from an attic , conducts him to the missing corpus delicti .

		It is done with a quite wonderful economy of effort , and little of the spec - tacularity usual on such occasions , but the story as a whole suggests that Miss
Wells	PERSON	will do better when she becomes more accustomed to this sort of writing ; the machinery creaks a little here .

		An old fashioned novel in its length and particu - larity of treatment is Mrs.
Kathleen A. Lund	PERSON	's `` Oliver in Willowmere '' -LRB- Heath ,
Cranton & Ouseley	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		With the third chapter we are introduced to fully thirty characters who play parts through - out the story .

		Chief of these characters is a non - conformist clergyman who for a time preaches to a congregation in the fenland country of
England	LOCATION	.

		The people of the book are well differentiated , and many of them will constitute friends for the reader , coming as they do from all the walks of life in a small English town .

		The protagonist of '' The Boss of the Lazy Y '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Mr.
Charles Alden Seltzer	PERSON	, is a reckless , ill-natured brute to whom his father on his death leaves his ranch on condition that the son show signs of amendment .

		To a young girl he leaves the actual possession of the property , with the provision that it shall revert to her at the end of a year if the experiment fails .

		This is the basis for all that is worth while in the story , but it is complicated with a great deal of needless episode which hampers the plausibility of the whole sensa - tional yarn .

		Grown persons as well as children will find inter - est in '' Pierrot , Dog of
Belgium	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , by Mr.
Walter A. Dyer	PERSON	.

		Its hero is one of those super - serviceable animals of
Flanders	LOCATION	, bred for use as a hauler of burdens in peace , and graduated into the service of a small-gun battery when war broke upon his unhappy country .

		One may enter deeply into the feelings of a stricken people through this faith - ful medium , and both the dog and his masters are impressively drawn .

		Studies in BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The
Percy Turnbull Memorial Chaucer and Foundation	ORGANIZATION	in the Johns Hop - his times .

		i TT - i i i
Kins University	ORGANIZATION	has brought forth some admirable lectures on poetry since
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	in
1891	DATE	delivered the first of the series on '' The Nature of Poetry . ''

		Unfortunately , too few of these have been published since
Jebb	PERSON	and
Tyrrell	PERSON	followed the excellent example of
Stedman	PERSON	in giv - ing a wider publicity to their lectures .

		We are therefore very glad that Professor Kit - tredge , who lectured last year on '' Chaucer and His Times , '' has had his lectures published -LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is no one in
America	LOCATION	more qualified to speak on Chaucer with discrimination and lively sympathy .

		He has interpreted the poet in terms of the pres - ent without any suggestion of cheap populari - zation .

		Chaucer moves before us as he did in that vital and interested age , pursuing his vast specialty , the study of mankind ; and he be - trays in his work the artist whose great joy was in his fellow man .

		Four works are taken up in considerable detail , `` The Book of the Duchess , '' '' The House of Fame , '' '' Troilus , '' and '' The Canterbury Tales . ''

		It is hard to say which of these is most successfully treated ; perhaps the lecture on '' The House of Fame '' is the least pleasing and that on '' Troilus '' reveals the scholar 's keenest enthusiasm .

		Especially good , just to mention a detail or two , is the discussion of the naivete of the '' Book of the Duchess '' as being that of the Dreamer -LRB- not Chaucer -RRB- , who displays such insight into the needs of a heart bleeding with grief that he has been accused by unsympa - thetic and undiscerning critics as being dull of comprehension instead of showing the '' art - less artfulness of a kindly and simple nature . '' ''

		Troilus '' is not merely '' the most beautiful long narrative poem in the English language , '' as
Rossetti	PERSON	termed it , but '' the first novel , in the modern sense , that ever was written in the world , and one of the best . ''

		So the poem is considered as a tragedy of character growing out of the tragedy of situation , and especial study is made of the three great characters ,
Troilus	ORGANIZATION	,
Cressida	PERSON	, and
Pandarus	LOCATION	, with the conclusion that something is amiss in this society with its code of love .

		When Troilus has died , '' the great sympathetic ironist drops his mask , and we find that he has once more been studying human life from the point of view of a ruling passion -LRB- as he had done in ' The House of Fame ' -RRB- , and that he has , no solution except to repudiate the unmoral and unsocial system which he had pretended to up - hold . ''

		`` The Canterbury Tales '' are treated 468 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	as a great drama in which the characters for the most part determine the action and the sequence of the tales .

		Especially is this seen in the
Marriage Group	ORGANIZATION	, which begins with the Wife of Bath 's Prologue and ends with the
Franklin	PERSON	's Tale .

		It is rather remarkable that no reference is made to Professor
Frederick Tupper	PERSON	's striking theory of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's use of the motifs of love and the seven deadly sins in binding these tales into a more complete unity than had hitherto been conceived of .

		A very interesting bit of interpretation is that of the lines at the close of the
Pardoner	ORGANIZATION	's Tale when he suddenly and unexpectedly drops his cyn - icism and shows that he has not always been an assassin of souls : '' And
Jesu Crist	PERSON	, that is our soules leche , So graunte yow his pardon to receyve ; For that is best I wol nat yow deceyve . ''

		`` A very paroxysm of agonized sincerity , '' to be followed immediately by '' a wild orgy of reckless jesting . ''

		It is strange !

		< The mystery In considering what
Tyndall	PERSON	has and the miracle expressively denoted '' the mys - tery and the miracle of vitality , '' Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	says : `` I have had a good deal of trouble in trying to make my in - born idealism go hand in hand with my inborn naturalism ; but I am not certain that there is any real break or contradiction between them , only a surface one , and that deeper down the j strata still unite them . ''

		Nevertheless , in the dozen chapters of his book , '' The Breath of Life '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from which these words are quoted , he makes no visible progress , and doubtless did not expect to , toward establish - ing a connection between the two .

		The mys - tery of life , defying all explanation on the part of scientist and naturalist , is his theme , from beginning to end , under slightly varying aspects , as it has already been his chosen topic in some of his former writings .

		Citing with more or less of agreement or dissent such authorities as
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	LOCATION	,
Spencer	PERSON	,
Hux	PERSON	- ley , Sir
Edwin Ray Lankester	PERSON	, Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	, and , with a different emphasis , Pro- fessor
Bergson	PERSON	-LRB- to whom he not very long ago devoted a cordially appreciative chapter -RRB- , Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	presents in highly interesting and suggestive fashion a cursory view of the dif - ferent methods of approach to this fascinating and tantalizing problem , and , as was of course to be expected , leaves us at last as hopelessly and delightfully perplexed as we were in the beginning .

		The very breath of life to the problem is its insolubility .

		More than half the charm of the book , for most readers , is ex - plained in its author 's prefatory confession of his own attitude toward his theme . ''

		I am forced to conclude , '' he tells us , '' that my pas - sion for nature and for all open-air life , though tinged and stimulated by science , is not a passion for pure science , but for literature and philosophy . ''

		His imagination and in - grained humanism , he adds , are appealed to by natural history , wherein he finds some - thing akin to poetry and religion .

		It is , in - deed , the poetry and the humanism of the book that render it so readable and make it litera - ture rather than science .

		A reproduction of Mr.
Pietro	PERSON	's bust of the author is shown in the frontispiece .

		A notable new book by Dr.
W. B. Cannon	PERSON	considers the subject of `` Bodily Changes in Pain , Hun - ger , Fear , and Rage '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		As the result of an elaborate series of ingenious experiments , a distinct mechanism is estab - lished for the emotional support .

		The adrenal glands play a central part in it .

		It is a specific device for the intensification of energy , and the further protection of the organism when un - der extreme emotional excitement in urgent situations .

		To a minor degree the same order of process accompanies emotional excitement of a milder range .

		Pain , hunger , fear , and rage represent the situations of the struggle for existence or its incidents .

		It is in the interests of these that the evolution of the mechanism has proceeded .

		Adrenin increases the blood sugar , hurries coagulation -LRB- a vital matter in the bloody business of fighting -RRB- , and gives spurt to muscular energy .

		All these changes are detectable in the subjects of ex - citement both players and spectators of a football game , as also in the `` before '' and '' after '' of a severe examination .

		The mechanism is intimately psychic ; the emotion is essential to its summons .

		The fact that ani - mals share a comparable emotional disposition is established .

		As the human mouth waters at the sight of tempting food , so also will the flow of saliva in a dog be stimulated only when appetite is present .

		Contrariwise , nervous excitement stops the flow of the gastric juices ; the reality of nervous indigestion is adequately sustained by physiological evidence .

		There are also illuminating side-lights upon the physiological setting of the emotional states ; not the least interesting of these is that the '' emotional '' defence of war has no exclusive vantage as against other active rivalries , such as sport .

		The central value of this able volume lies in its correlation of the physiological changes ; it thus gives a consistent interpreta - tion of certain hitherto obscure mechanisms of the emotional life .

		It is a positive and an important contribution .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 469 international ^ 111 wwot years there has been the
Monroe	PERSON	an increasing disposition among students of American foreign policy to find fault with , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	as it is now interpreted ; and some , even , are beginning to denounce it as an obsolete shib - boleth , the continued enforcement of which by the
United States	LOCATION	alone is a wrong to the greater powers of
South America	LOCATION	and a con - stant source of danger to this country .

		Some demand that it should be abolished outright ; others that it should be radically altered , and restored to its original character ; still others , that it should be `` internationalized , '' and other nations be invited to cooperate with the
United States	LOCATION	in the maintenance of the doc - trine .

		Among those who advocate the last - mentioned policy is Professor
W. I. Hull	PERSON	of
Swarthmore College	ORGANIZATION	, who has recently pub - lished a little volume of addresses entitled '' The
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine : National or Inter - national '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , in which he maintains that the
United States	LOCATION	can not expect to lay the foundation of permanent peace and genu - ine justice if it continues to insist on an exclu - sive responsibility for the doctrine .

		It is not only foolish but wrong , he argues , for a single nation to attempt to perform what is evi - dently a world-task .

		The rest of the world , we are told , has lost patience with our attempts to square our practice with our political the - ory , and it has become increasingly evident that the logical solution of the problem is the assumption of the rights and responsibilities which the doctrine entails , by the entire fam - ily of nations and its subjection to the institu - tions established at the
Hague	LOCATION	.

		There is much in this suggestion that will commend itself to thoughtful men ; but there are still many to whom the idea will , as Professor
Hull	PERSON	admits , appear to be little short of treasonable .

		.

		, - , , , Few writers on charity work A contribution - , - , - , - , s a to social have had so long and varied an experience therein as Dr.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
T. Devine	PERSON	,
General Secretary of the Charity Organization Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York City	LOCATION	, and either past or present officer in many similar bodies engaged in the relief of distress and the amelioration of social evils .

		Thus his book , '' The Normal Life , '' speaks with a meas - ure of authority that is none the less impres - sive by reason of its tentative , undogmatic way of presenting social problems and their possible solutions .

		He recognizes '' how little we have done as yet about some things , how few are the consecrated workers , how limited our vision , how inadequate our practical appli - cation of that admirable principle of coopera - tion so constantly on our lips , how provincial and fragmentary all our philanthropy , even the best of it , how unworthy to be called either charity or justice , if by those noble words we mean what our fathers meant , or what our sons will mean by those or better terms describ - ing the better human relations which are to be . ''

		Instead of treating specifically any one or several of the pressing social problems , the author chooses '' another method of approach , hoping that we may get both unity and propor - tion into our study , and perhaps see some old problems in a new light , if we take for our background the normal individual life , and , following it through from beginning to end , try to determine what are the social conditions and social provisions which are essential at each stage to securing it . ''

		This normal life he considers successively in its seven natural divisions , the pre-natal period , infancy , child - hood , adolescence , early maturity , full matur - ity , and old age ; and that reader must be little interested in human welfare who fails to find the book full of suggestion .

		Its value to social workers is beyond question .

		Dr.
Devine	PERSON	finds time , amid his other activities , to edit '' The Survey , '' as many readers already know , and his present volume is published by the
Survey Associates	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		As
John Muir	PERSON	was known as the Father of the Yosemite , so Mr.
Enos A. Mills	PERSON	might fairly be called the
Father of Rocky Mountain Park	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is largely due to his untiring enthusiasm and perseverance that this magnificent bit of mountain scenery has been preserved for all time as a playground for the people .

		In his book , `` The Rocky Mountain Wonderland '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Mills	PERSON	describes this region of towering peaks , canyons , alpine meadows , forests , and lakes .

		But he does much more than this : his book is the record of one who has for many years lived on intimate terms with the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	and their wild inhabitants , and writes from the fulness of his knowledge .

		The titles of some of his chapters suggest the range of his knowledge and interest ; but they can give only a faint idea of the minute - ness and sympathy with which he has studied the life of the mountains , and none at all of the charming simplicity and directness of his style .

		He tells us intimate stories of
Mountain Sheep	ORGANIZATION	, Grizzly Bear , Beaver ,
Silver Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Woodchuck	LOCATION	, and Chipmunk ; of the struggle for existence in winter snows ; of the growth and decline of forests and mountain lakes ; of the birds and flowers that lend music , color , and fragrance to these high wildernesses ; of the eccentricities of snow-slides ; and of a hundred and one other things that make up 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 10	DATE	this mountain world of which most of us , even those who have spent many seasons in the Rockies , know so very little .

		And to illustrate his narrative , Mr.
Mills	PERSON	has brought together a score or more of striking photographs of mountain life and scenery .

		Altogether the book is a notable one .

		Scientific information for the ex Perts and specialists in tropi - cal medicine and sanitation has grown with astonishing rapidity in the past decade , and popular treatises on restricted parts of the subject are available for the lay - man .

		However , no single book written from the elementary standpoint in simple concise form so fully covers the whole field as does Mr.
W. Alexander Muirhead	PERSON	's '' Practical Tropical Sanitation '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The author has had a prominent part in the practical administration of the application of the science of preventive medicine under frontier conditions in the tropics .

		This probably explains the didactic tone of treatment , and the forceful presenta - tion as well as the minor omissions , imperfec - tions , and occasional scientific lapses .

		The book treats of the causes of avoidable tropical diseases , and their methods of social control , of mosquitoes and flies and the havoc they play by spreading malaria , sleeping sickness , and other forms of transmissible disease .

		The principles , methods , and official routine of inspection , disinfection , and police control are diagrammatically outlined .

		Ventilation , the protection of food and water , and the disposal of refuse are discussed in an elementary way , and sanitary law and practice are fully elabo - rated .

		The work is a valuable one for sani - tary constabulary , and for lay use by estates , mines , and all commercial enterprises in the tropics for popular instruction and social pro- tection .

		The reduction of the death rate among European officials in
West Africa	LOCATION	from 90 to 11.8 per thousand between
1896	DATE	and
1913	DATE	by sanitary measures is a convincing argument for the utility of the methods advo - cated in this manual .

		Determinism and romance .

		Pierre -LRB- Mme.
Favre	PERSON	-RRB- de Coule - vain does not give us a book of fiction in `` The Wonderful Ro - mance '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but has availed herself nevertheless of her ability as a story teller in bringing together all sorts of inci - dents from real life , from history , and from religion , to show the world what enlighten - ment comes from complete acceptance of the doctrines of determinism .

		That we are under an immutable law , predetermined in its action down to the minutest detail , is her firm convic - tion , and free will she puts by as carefully as any Calvinist .

		That this law is beneficent in its operations , however things may seem , she proves as far as she can , and it serves to sup - port as buoyant an optimism as can well be imagined .

		By the light of her faith she exam - ines many incidents in her own experience , some of them trifles taken by themselves ; and passes from them to great sweeps of history , such as one finds in
Gibbon	LOCATION	, and to great human institutions , such as the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The universe is her field , at last , and everywhere is there evident to her eyes a great power , not ourselves , working for righteous - ness .

		Needless to say , the individual counts for comparatively little in such a philosophy .

		But the writer 's outlook is clear and hopeful , and the book is well written and entertaining even when seeking most to be instructive .

		The translation , made by Miss
Alys Hallard	PERSON	, leaves much to be desired .

		The work is dedicated to
America	LOCATION	, ' ' Country of New Thoughts . ' '

		The universal actions have been Sim - appeal o / pie , and all great pictures are , says
Emerson	PERSON	, whom Professor
Edwin Watts Chubb	PERSON	appositely quotes in opening his '' Sketches of Great Painters , '' a series of untechnical chapters offered by one who , as he modestly explains , thought he might , '' knowing so little about art .

		.

		be able to interest the ' hoi polloi ' who know even less . ''

		Accordingly he has set down the things that interest him , and that will interest many others , in regard to certain masters , old and modern , and their masterpieces .

		Appreciative comment , biographical information , and char - acteristic anecdote , all find appropriate place in the fifteen sketches dealing with as many artists , not arranged in chronological or any other order , apparently , but introduced each as the impulse moved .

		Thus
Raphael	PERSON	heads the list and Van Dyck stands at the foot , while between them are scattered Millet ,
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	,
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Turner	LOCATION	, Ti - tian ,
Rubens	PERSON	,
Corot	LOCATION	,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, Rey - nolds ,
Murillo	PERSON	,
Velasquez	PERSON	, and
Rosa Bonheur	PERSON	.

		The author has spent many hours in the chief picture-galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, so that his present work is no hasty production of the moment .

		Gifted with a taste for the best in art , he renders intelligent aid to his readers in the appreciation of that best , and does it in so unobtrusive and undogmatic a manner as to ingratiate himself at once with the '' hoi polloi '' whom , with humorous self - depreciation , he hopes to interest .

		Eighteen reproductions of well-known masterpieces are provided , and the book is published in pleasing form by the
Stewart & Kidd Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 471 m nmn ' i n , Amid the welter of Feministic Woman s place .

		in modern literature , Mrs.
Florence Guerin Tuttle	PERSON	's `` The Awakening of Woman '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should take an honorable place .

		Despite the continual striv - ing after phrasal felicities , and the rather pro- nounced oratorical style , there is so much truth and such a degree of reasonableness in it that it must do the cause good in quarters which have hitherto been impervious .

		The chapters dealing with '' Woman and Genius , '' '' Creative Womanhood , '' and '' Motherhood '' are the least provocative of irrelevant objec - tions .

		The analysis of the conditions necessary to genius is very good , but certainly many sympathetic readers will find the writer 's selection of
Madame Montessori	ORGANIZATION	,
Madame Curie	PERSON	, and
Mary Baker Eddy	PERSON	as the three greatest geniuses among modern women a curious one . ''

		The Revaluation of Life '' and '' The Relation to Eugenics '' are not so sanely reasonable .

		The author makes the common mistake of assuming that children , especially female children , have only one parent , a mother ; also that the father 's relation to the child is nearly , if not altogether , a material one .

		She is also peculiarly responsible for the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy that the immense recent progress in eugenics is due to the work of women .

		The book has not been sufficiently revised for perfect coherence ; but it is on the whole stimulating , suggestive , and distinctly worth while .

		New edition SeV6n y eaFS a g the ReV '
John	PERSON	of a handbook
P. Jones	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, produced an un - usually good introductory book on ``
India	LOCATION	: Its Life and Thought '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		It was frankly intended for readers who were not familiar with the field , and was `` based on thirty years of matured expe - rience ' ' in the most interesting land under the sun .

		Naturally , the author 's point of view was given by his life work ; but he tried to be scrupulously fair , and has succeeded much better than many of his fellow workers .

		The first edition had four successors , and on the whole this popularity has been deserved .

		However , we have one serious protest to enter : the references to political
India	LOCATION	should have been brought up to date in the issue of
1915	DATE	, lately published .

		It is simply absurd to print in a book appearing this year the following statement about Lord
Morley	PERSON	's famous reor - ganization : ' ' Even at the present time the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	for
India	LOCATION	has introduced a scheme which will add materially to the power of
India	LOCATION	in the conduct of its own affairs . ''

		Similarly , there is no excuse for quoting the census of
1901	DATE	when the figures for
1911	DATE	have been available so long .

		Furthermore , why should our best publishing houses not adopt the plan of printing distinctly on the title - page the number of the edition , with the date of the work 's original appearance ?

		Of course we may usually turn the leaf over and find this information in small type ; but the more direct method has every advantage .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Outlines and Summaries '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , a little man - ual prepared by Professor
Norman Foerster	PERSON	for the use of freshmen in college , presents a formal and practical method of teaching students how to make analyses of expository essays .

		The illustrative material is fresh and interesting , and the compiler 's enthusiasm for his task is very clearly reflected throughout .

		`` Readings from American Literature '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , by
Mary Edwards Calhoun	PERSON	and
Emma Leonora MacAlarney	PERSON	, is a textbook combining both prose and verse .

		It will be welcomed , as something that has long been needed , even though the idiosyncra - cies of the editors , and no doubt copyright difficul - ties as well , have prevented it from being as repre - sentative as many teachers will wish .

		The space given to seventeenth and eighteenth century writers seems proportionally too great , at least for high school students ; and several later writers who should be included in even a hurried survey of American literature are omitted altogether .

		But the selections are in general well made .

		For children who find the transition from the rhythmic work of the kindergarten to the more elaborate folk and aesthetic dancing somewhat diffi - cult , and consequently uninteresting , Mrs.
Irene E. Phillips Moses	PERSON	has arranged a book on '' Rhythmic Action : Plays and Dances '' -LRB-
Milton Bradley Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , that is adapted to the needs of the primary school , playground , and gymnasium .

		Many of the rhymes are from `` Mother Goose '' ; the others are all popular favorites , or else have been chosen because of their contemporary or nature-study interest .

		Illustrations and music add to the usefulness of the volume , which has been prepared primarily to give pleasure to active , healthy childhood .

		The
California	LOCATION	missions have received their full share of attention during the past two years , owing to the adventitious interest derived from the Pan - ama-Pacific Exposition .

		Accordingly ,
Messrs. J. Smeaton	PERSON	Chase and
Charles Francis Saunders	PERSON	have been at some pains to give a new turn to their treatment of '' The
California Padres	LOCATION	and Their Missions '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		They begin with the per - sonal contact with the traveller with each mission , and end with some personal reminiscence of one or another padre connected with the mission discussed .

		The volume is an intimate and sociable guide-book , the material of which seems to be trustworthy , excepting where it frankly gives rein to the imag - ination .

		The making of the book , including the illustrations , is well up to the high standard which we have come to expect from the publishing house whose imprint it bears .

Scrimati Svarna Kumari Devi	PERSON	-RRB- , the sister of
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, whose Indian romance `` An Unfinished Song '' was published in an English translation about a year ago , has trans - lated another of her novels for early issue , under the title '' The Fatal Garland . ''

		The story , which is illustrated by native artists , is written round some events of Indian history of the fourteenth century , and contains much of Hindu philosophy .

		An English publishing house will shortly publish on the same date two books on Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, in one of which he is proclaimed as '' the twentieth century Moliere , '' and in the other denounced under the title '' Common Sense about the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The first work is an English edition of the study of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	by
Augustin Hamon	PERSON	, translated from the third French edition by
Eden	ORGANIZATION	and Cedar
Paul	PERSON	.

		The denunciation has been written by Mr.
Harold Owen	PERSON	, part author of the play '' Mr.
Wu	PERSON	. ''

		A new edition is in preparation of '' The Col - lected Works of
Aphra Behn	PERSON	, '' in six volumes , printed by Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	at the
Shakespeare Head Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	, under the editor - ship of Mr.
Montague Summers	PERSON	.

		More than forty years have elapsed since the last edition of
Aphra Behn	PERSON	was issued , and that was merely a reprint , with no attempt at serious editing , omitting much of her work , including all her poetry .

		Even in its incomplete state , the edition of
1874	DATE	has become rare and costly .

		The place of
Belgium	LOCATION	in the modern world of letters is estimated in Mr.
Jethro Bithell	PERSON	's study of '' Contemporary Belgian Literature , '' which Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	will shortly publish .

		The author traces the development of recent Belgian literature from about the year
1880	DATE	when a group of students at
Louvain	LOCATION	, including
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, .

		began the campaign for new ideals in the Uni - versity magazines down to the present day .

		Ex - amples are given of the best work of representative authors , especially of the poets .

		The latest number to reach us of '' Special Li - braries '' Vol .

		6 , No. 4 -LRB-
April , 1915	DATE	-RRB- contains an article of some length , and rich in noteworthy facts , on '' Organized Information in the Use of Business , '' by Mr.
John A. Lapp	PERSON	, Director of the
Indiana Bureau of Legislative Information	ORGANIZATION	; a shorter article on '' Handling a
Large Circulation	ORGANIZATION	in an Office Library , '' by the librarian of the Pub -
lic Service Commission Library	ORGANIZATION	of
New York City	LOCATION	; a fourteen-page '' List of References on Municipal Accounting , '' and a page or more of names of bibliographies relating to municipal administra - tion , social work , the present war , and other subjects .

		The recent death in the Dardanelles of the prom - ising young English poet and critic ,
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	, , has naturally led to a decided general interest in his work .

		There will soon appear a volume con - taining all the poems written by him since the appearance of his
1911	DATE	volume .

		The new book will be called ''
1914	DATE	, and Other Poems , '' and will contain a photogravure portrait .

		The five
1914	DATE	sonnets will come first in the book ; then a group called '' The South Seas '' ; then a number of '' Other Poems '' ; and then '' The Old Vicarage . ''

		We may expect it to be followed by a collected edition including the poems , the book on
Webster	PERSON	, the critical articles , and the prose sketches which were among the most charming things that
Brooke	PERSON	wrote , '' State Documents for Libraries '' is the title of a carefully written pamphlet of 163 pages , form - ing No. 36 of Vol .

		12 of the '' University of
Illi	PERSON	- nois Bulletin . ''

		Mr.
Ernest J. Reece	PERSON	, of the
Library School	ORGANIZATION	of that university is its author , and he has grouped his matter under six heads , '' The
Field of State Documents	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The
Selection of State Documents	ORGANIZATION	for Libraries , '' '' Description of State
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 473 Departments and Documents , '' '' The
Treatment of State Documents	ORGANIZATION	in Libraries , '' '' The Distribution of
State Documents	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' Bibliographical Mat - ter . ''

		The methods of distribution in our different states are fully described , and suggestions are offered for '' a model law on printing and distri - bution . ''

		All librarians are more or less tormented by the public-document problem , and they will welcome this able monograph on the subject .

		The `` Twentieth Annual Report '' of the
John Crerar	PERSON	Library notes the unavoidable injurious effect of the war upon its activities , and yet chron - icles encouraging progress in growth and useful - ness .

		Additional room has been secured on the seventh floor of the building where the library is now situated , pending the erection of a building of its own , which the directors have decided not to begin until
1917	DATE	.

		Unusually long , compared with that of other libraries , is the list of donors to the
John Crerar	PERSON	Library for the year
1914	DATE	; it fills forty-five double-column fine-print pages .

		A biographical notice of the late
Eliphalet Wiekes Blatchford	PERSON	, director from the foundation of the library , and since
1900	DATE	chairman of the committee on administration , is contained in the Report .

		An intimate picture of Roman social and family life under the Napoleonic regime is contained in '' The Patrizi Memoirs , '' by the
Marchesa Madda	PERSON	-
lena Patrizi	PERSON	, translated by Mr.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	, which will appear shortly .

		The book is based on letters and diaries collected by the author through years of research in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and printed for family circulation some years ago .

		It is now pre - sented to the public for the first time , with an historical introduction by Mr.
J. Crawford Fraser	PERSON	.

		The worst side of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's character is revealed in his treatment of the
Marchese Giovanni Patrizi	PERSON	and his wife , who , as the Princess Cunigonda of
Saxony	LOCATION	, and cousin of Louis XVI. , roused the worst hatred of the Emperor .

		The records serve to show that whereas the harsh treatment of those who were considered dangerous and recalcitrant Catholics T ^ as left to the officials ,
Napoleon	PERSON	himself made that of the
Patrizi	PERSON	family his personal affair .

		We quote the following interesting paragraph from the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' : '' Sir
William Robert	PERSON	- son
Nicoll	PERSON	has not abandoned his project of writing a history of English periodical literature in the Victorian era .

		We have become so accustomed to periodicals that it is not easy to realize the extent - of their influence on the world of books .

		They Tiave certainly affected the development of prose style , something of the form as well as the content of our fiction is due to them , and it is through them that the greater part of our literary criticism has been introduced to the world . '

		If any one will run over in his mind the list of the most remarkable critical books of the last fifty years / says Pro- fessor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, ' he will find that scarcely one in ten , perhaps not one in twenty , has had an original appearance wholly independent of the periodical . ' '

		To write articles for money and books for love ' is often a convenient arrangement , and not the least of the services of the periodicals is that they have enabled men of letters to gain a livelihood without sacrificing their independence . ''
