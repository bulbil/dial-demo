		24 SCANDINAVIAN STUDY IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		Of the multiplication of societies , as of books , there is no end .

		In these days of specialized scholarship , the subject unit upon which organi - zation is based tends to become smaller and smaller , while the method of study grows cor - respondingly more intensive .

		It is not surpris - ing , then , that we should at last have a Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study to add to the existing number of scholarly organi - zations devoted to cultural interests .

		It is even surprising that we should not have had such an organization long before , since Scandinavian study affords a comparatively wide field for investigation , and the degree of its interest historical , archaeological , philological , and liter - ary offers unexpectedly broad vistas to those who give it their serious attention .

		It is a relatively untapped source of many-sided intel - lectual satisfaction , and we venture to say that no one who has found his way to it has had cause to regret the adventure .

		The army of tourists who every
summer	DATE	in - vade the Scandinavian countries come back fairly entranced with their experiences .

		They discover a region endowed with the elements of scenic picturesqueness in infinite variety , and make the acquaintance of a sturdy and self - respecting people who welcome the traveller and do not prey upon him .

		They discover a second '' playground of
Europe	LOCATION	'' which vies in attractiveness with the Alpine country which has hitherto laid exclusive claim to that title .

		And if to the surface observation of the tourist they add something of the temper of the student , supplementing their visual impressions with the impressions to be gained from books , they find themselves inhabitants of a new world of in - terest .

		The elements of that interest include a rich treasure of mythology and legendary lore , a history that reveals the old Norseman in the most dramatic enterprises and contacts in the British Isles and
Russia	LOCATION	, in Viking raids on the coast of southern
Europe	LOCATION	, in
Norman	LOCATION	and
Sicil	PERSON	- ian settlements , in expeditions to
Athens	LOCATION	,
Micklegarth	LOCATION	, and the Holy Land , in the suc - cessive discoveries of
Iceland	LOCATION	,
Greenland	LOCATION	, and
Vinland	ORGANIZATION	, an archaeology of which only those who have visited the great museums at Stock - holm and
Copenhagen	LOCATION	can have any adequate THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	idea , a language simple , strong , and illuminative of its allied tongues , and , last but not least , a literature that , in its range from the eddas and sagas to the works of
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, ex - hibits almost every variety of material and of charm .

		Most cultivated people have a fragmentary knowledge of these things , but few have brought them into any satisfactory system of relations .

		Such an arrangement and synthesis as might be worked out upon the basis of the above sug - gestions , if presented in suitably artistic form , would open very wide many American eyes that have hitherto caught only occasional glimpses of the Scandinavian world of legend , history , and culture .

		It is because the new society of which we are now writing may be counted upon to do much toward the accom - plishment of this desirable revelation that we welcome its advent into the field of scholarship .

		Its organization was effected during a two days ' session held in
Chicago	LOCATION	a little more than a month ago .

		About forty persons were actually present , and the names of nearly twice that number are already on the roll of membership .

		A constitution was adopted , officers and com - mittees were elected , many interesting papers were read , and arrangements were made for such publications as the means of the organiza - tion may make possible .

		We are particularly glad that the name first suggested '' The Scandinavian Philological Society of
America	LOCATION	'' was not fastened upon the organization .

		The word '' philological '' would have been unfortu - nate , not because it is inherently inapplicable to a society of the widest scope , but because its popular associations are such as to repel rather than to attract many persons whose support it is desirable to enlist .

		While linguistic and historical studies of a minutely technical char - acter form a legitimate part of the work to be done , we trust that they will never be permitted to obscure its far more important cultural er humanistic aspects .

		To tag the society as '' philological '' would be to create a prejudice against it from the start .

		Concerning the alternative name suggested , it seems to us too long , and the word `` advancement '' might well be left to be understood .

		Such a name as The Society for Scandinavian Studies would give offense to none , and would meet all the needs of the case .

		The slender pamphlet which reports the pro- ceedings of the
May	DATE	session has for its special feature a sketch of the history of Scandinavian study in American universities , by Professor
George T. Flom	PERSON	.

		We cite a few interesting facts from this paper .

		The first Scandinavian professorship in
America	LOCATION	was established in
1858	DATE	, in
New York University	ORGANIZATION	, with
Paul Sinding	PERSON	as its incumbent , and it lasted for three years .

		The next date of importance is
1869	DATE	, when chairs were established in
Wiscon	LOCATION	- sin and
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1880	DATE	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	was added to the list , and eight more institutions during the following decade .

		The decade 1891-1900 made the total number twenty-one , and the twentieth century has increased that number to thirty-seven .

		Of this present num - ber , ten are in the
East	LOCATION	, six in the far West , and the remaining twenty-one in the
Central States	LOCATION	.

		Something like one hundred and twenty courses are now offered in all .

		The philological courses still preponderate , but the modern courses are steadily gaining .

		The con - trast between East and West is instructively illustrated by the following paragraph . ''

		In the East the work was fostered by men who wer & inspired by love of the literature and the learning of Old
Iceland	LOCATION	, and this emphasis upon the older literature has prevailed in the Scandinavian instruction of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	universities down to the present time .

		As a result of this ,
Old Norse	ORGANIZATION	language and literature has .

		won for itself something like a tradition among Ger - manic scholars there ; its place is as secure as that of Gothic and Old High German in the requirements for a higher degree in Germanics .

		In the West the point of departure was the modern period , a modern language , and the instructors in charge have in nearly all cases been of Scandinavian nationality .

		The older period , , however , gradually came to receive a larger share of attention in the West , until now nearly all the institu - tions also offer Old Norse , and some of them actually give more instruction in the older periods than is given , in any of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	schools .

		And in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	group there has been offered an increasing number of courses upon the modern languages and literatures of the Scandinavian North . ''

		Those whose interests in this field are primarily concerned with the literature of the Scandinavian countries will welcome the ap - pointment of a
Committee on Translations	ORGANIZATION	, , whose function it is to encourage in every way possible the reproduction in English of Scan - dinavian works .

		We say '' literature '' rather than '' literatures '' advisedly , because to the outsider the literatures are practically one , and their differences of language seem little more significant than the differences between High and Low German , or between Spanish and Catalonian , or between Italian and Sicilian .

		There is , moreover , a stategic point to be gained by urging this view , because Scandinavian liter - ature , if considered as a unit , may fairly be held the equal in importance of any other
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL modern literature , always excepting the three which clearly outrank the rest .

		That is , Scan - dinavian literature may fairly be weighed in the balance with Italian , or Spanish , or Russian , with some doubt as to which scale will fall ; whereas Danish , or Swedish , or Norwegian liter - ature , considered by itself , can lay claim to a place in the third rank only , along with Dutch and Polish and Hungarian .

		Once get the public to realize that it is culturally as desirable -LRB- or would be were it not for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Cervantes	PERSON	-RRB- to know Scandinavian literature as it is to know Italian or Spanish , and the battle is more than half won .

		And to bring about this realization nothing is more important than that we should have access to good translations of a great many more masterpieces than are at present available in the English language .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NATIONAL LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND , where the best current literature can be had , is likely to become an actuality at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		There was organized in that city a few days ago an association of philanthropists to be known as the Society of the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	for the Blind , which proposes to erect a large building in
Washington	LOCATION	for the use of blind readers , for the preparation and preservation of texts in raised type , and for the widest possible circulation of these books among those needing them .

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	is the president of the society and will write the first book to be printed by it for sightless readers .

		Miss
Etta Joselyn Giffin	PERSON	, for many years head of the '' blind '' depart - ment of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	, was chosen director ; and Rev. Dr.
Henry Noble Couden	PERSON	, the blind chaplain of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, will serve the Society in the same ministerial capacity .

		This new association is just now especially needed because of the recent cessation of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	's activities for the blind , Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	hav - ing decided last
October	DATE	that such work did not properly belong to the
Library	ORGANIZATION	, whereupon its books , sheet music , etc. , for the blind were transferred to the
District of Columbia Library	ORGANIZATION	, which could only give its basement to their reception .

		Accordingly a special building , partly self-supporting by means of a large auditorium that it will contain and will rent for lectures and other entertainments , is what the new society most needs and hopes soon to have .

		And then , let us hope , it may be possible to respond satisfactorily to the pathetic appeal of a
Boston	LOCATION	blind man who recently asked : '' Why can not we have a few of the healthy wide-awake novels of the present day , such as our brothers are reading , and everybody is talking about ? ''

		Eighty thousand blind persons in the
United States	LOCATION	feel , or ought to feel , this want ; and the mail service will bring the desired books to their doors without charge , as soon as the books themselves are to be had from any library for the blind .

		But popular support , and government sup - port , will be necessary in generous measure before the large possibilities of the new undertaking can be realized .

		... A WAIL FROM THE SORBONNE has been ut - tered by two students writing over the signature '' Agathon , '' in loud complaint of the recent decline in classical culture at that famous seat of learn - ing .

		As a
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' puts it , `` Agathon finds in the ' Palace ' of the
New Sorbonne	LOCATION	no stronghold of traditional French culture , no intelligent interpre - tation of the seventeenth-century classics , no leaven of Greek and Roman thought for the modern world .

		On the contrary , he meets in every corridor a horde of Germanic , socialistic , pseudo-scientific influences , transforming the institution into an arid desert where nothing flourishes but the cactus of bibliog - raphy and the aloe of card-indexes .

		The subjects of study are split into an infinity of specialized chapters , so small and so narrow as to have no real educational value .

		It is merely ' the dust of edu - cation . ' ''

		Not the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, however , nor any one educational institution , should be severely blamed for the recent decline from former high standards of culture in
France	LOCATION	.

		There have been lamentations heard from other quarters , as already noted by us , and they all owe their origin to the so-called reforms of ten years ago in the department of education reforms that indicate the shifting of power in the French Chamber of Deputies toward the extreme Left .

		Ultra-democracy is in the saddle , and the steed is headed toward the practical , the tangible , and the utilitarian .

		What is most urgently de - manded at present , as a writer in the '' Temps '' has expressed it , is `` less of the utilitarian fever and more of the human ideal . ''

		THE SIR
BOYLE ROCHE	PERSON	OF TO-DAY is as rich in laughter-provoking absurdities of political oratory as was he of the eighteenth century .

		It was not very many years ago that an Assemblyman at
Albany	LOCATION	rose to address the house with the assertion that the previous speaker had used '' the word ' parsimony ' as a shibboleth with which to beat the laboring man . ''

		Of course ' shillalah ' was what the speaker had in his mind 's eye ; but ` shibboleth ' had an air of greater erudition and elegance .

		A certain Irish Unionist recently characterized a con - cession to the Nationalists as '' the first stitch in the dismemberment of the Empire . ''

		Sir
W. Hart Dyke	PERSON	is said to have complimented Mr.
Lowther	PERSON	by saying that the latter '' had caught a big fish in his net and he went to the top of the tree for it . ''

		Even so skilful a speaker as Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	is reported to have said , in replying to an opponent who had shaken his head in denial of some state - ment attributed to him : '' No , no ; it will not do for the honorable member to shake his head in the 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, teeth of his own words . ''

		And the present Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	has to his credit the remark that '' retribution is a thorny subject which requires delicate handling , or it will tread on somebody 's toes . ''

		Still another , from the Manchester '' Guard - ian , '' to which we are already indebted : '' An empty theatre of unsympathetic auditors '' was a Unionist member 's emphatic characterization of a small and unapplausive audience .

		It is a question for the psychologist to puzzle over , whether the perpetrator of bulls quick-witted Irishman as he so often is really blunders with his metaphors and is unconscious of his verbal absurdities , or whether it is not rather his embarrassment of rhetorical riches and his impatience of the time and care needed to display them to the best advantage that are the cause of his occasional com - mission of what the rhetoricians would call apophasis or paraleipsis , or , in some instances , oxymoron .

		Perhaps it is the laughers themselves who are sometimes dull .

		Surely , if the greatest of Roman orators could allow himself to say , as he did in his second oration against Catiline , '' Quae tecum ... tacita loquitur , '' a public speaker of to-day ought to be allowed some latitude in the use of phrases that are now and then all the more telling because of their seeming self-contradiction or their depic - tion of the manifestly impossible .

		A CONSOLATION FOB ARTISTIC SHORTCOMINGS in this land of the strenuous life is cheerfully pointed out by Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	in her recent address at the
Women Writers ' Coronation Dinner	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		`` I insist , '' she says , `` upon finding inspiration for one thing in
England	LOCATION	, for another in
France	LOCATION	, for another in my own native air .

		The attitude of mind I have always believed in , is to answer , when anybody says how ugly Mrs.
Blank	PERSON	's nose is , ' yes , but hasn ' t she a lovely complexion ! '

		Must I hang my head because we are not pro- ducing great poets in
America	LOCATION	?

		I wo n't deny that I should like a great poet in the family better than anything in the world ; but I refuse to be dis - couraged about the situation , knowing that the national imagination is spending itself in this half - century in invention , in research , in momentous enterprises .

		We do not rebuke the Elizabethan age for not having busied itself with telephones and wireless telegraphs , phonographs , turbine steamers , cancer hospitals , and open plumbing , but gratefully accept the rich heritage we did receive at its hands . ''

		Nevertheless anyone would feel prouder to have produced a
Ninth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	than the gramophone on which it is mechanically repro - duced , and to have written a `` Tintern Abbey '' than to have built the highest skyscraper in the world .

		Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's consolatory words remind us though the story is not quite apropos , and the illustration is not exactly just of a certain small boy , the least gifted of three children , who , when the others were exhibiting their vocal and instru - mental accomplishments for the entertainment of guests , made exultant answer to an inquiry as to what he could do : `` I can squeak iny shoe ! ''

		Our achievements in science and industry , considerable though they are , are not precisely what we should point to in any international comparison of literary or artistic genius ; young though we are , we have other and less material products to be proud of .

		AN ONSLAUGHT ON THE PHILISTINES has been made by that distinguished psychologist and father of an infant prodigy , Dr.
Boris Sidis	PERSON	.

		His little book , '' Philistine and Genius , '' will serve as a sort of counterblast against the recent much larger book of the
Chicago	LOCATION	manufacturer , Mr.
Crane	PERSON	, who ap - parently has as little use for polite culture as Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	has for the bread-and-butter or vocational courses now in the ascendant .

		The one would have our educational system still further commercialized ; the other deplores its already too pronounced utili - tarian tendency .

		`` It is certainly unfortunate , '' says Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	, '' that the favored type of superintendent of our public education should be such a hopeless philistine , possessed of all the conceit of the mediocre business man .

		Routine is his ideal .

		Originality is spurned and suppressed . ''

		And further , hitting at educators somewhat higher up than public school superintendents , he declares that '' business men are no more competent to run schools and colleges than astronomers are fit to run hotels and theatres . ''

		If it be indeed true that we are rapidly becoming '' a crowd of well-drilled , well-disciplined , commonplace individuals , with strong philistine habits and notions of hopeless mediocrity , '' then there is cause for alarm , and crying need of such awakening calls to higher things as is sounded in trumpet tones by Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	's book .

		The danger of routine , of institution - alism , of subservience to convention , and of all like forms of torpidity and living death , is an ever-present one ; and even if not quite so imminent and alarming just now as the eloquent author believes , yet such utterances as his are seldom untimely .

		TAKING ONE 'S FICTION SERIOUSLY that is , with something of the earnestness and eagerness of a child listening to a fairy tale is indispensable to the hearty enjoyment of a novel and to entire ab - sorption in its pages .

		Commenting on the recent establishment of a professorship of fiction by the
Royal Society of Literature	ORGANIZATION	, and on the appointment of Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	to be its first in - cumbent , the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' cordially approves of the move , which it hopes will tend to make the English cherish greater respect for the novelist 's art and to regard it with somewhat of the seriousness accorded to it in
France	LOCATION	.

		That a professorship of fiction can produce fiction-writers of genius , is not hoped for ; but that it can make fiction - readers of discrimination and of more exalted ideals than those at present held by the mass of English devotees to the novel and the short-story , is expected with some
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , confidence .

		And yet if it is true that the English already are too much inclined to take their pleasure sadly , and if it is also true , as the '' Times '' admits , that they do not feel the Frenchman 's keen delight in a novel for the simple sake of the story and the charm of its telling , but are even yet too fond of the moralizing or the didactic or the otherwise purpose - concealing novel of the
Kingsley	PERSON	or Reade type , how can they , by any amount of taking-thought under the tuition of a professor of fiction , add the smallest fraction of a cubit unto their stature as lovers of pure romance ?

		Not tuition , but intuition , would seem to be lacking .

		Nevertheless , to a man of genius , even though tied to a professor 's chair , all things are possible ; and it is with interest and with hopes for good results that we shall watch the course pursued by Professor
Benson	PERSON	.

		A PROMISING FIELD FOR THE BOOK-WAGON lies open , and as yet , so far as we know , uninvaded , in
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		In the few regions in which it has been tried elsewhere and conspicuously in
Washing	LOCATION	-
ton County	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	the library on wheels has proved a success .

		Agricultural and intellectual
Vermont	LOCATION	, with its toiling population , little more than that of the single city of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, scattered over nine thousand square miles of mountain and valley , could make good use of at least fourteen well-stocked book-wagons one for each county .

		It is true that of the
State	ORGANIZATION	's two hundred and forty-six cities and townships , one hundred and seventy-nine -LRB- or possibly a few more now -RRB- have public libraries , while seventeen of the less fortunate minority have travelling-library stations ; but there must still be thousands of families too far distant from book collections of any sort to be able to get sight of an attractive work of literature from
year 's end to year 's end	DATE	.

		To such , the book-wagon or why might it not now be the speedier book - automobile ?

		would be a heaven-sent blessing , a glad distraction in the soul-deadening monotony of
New England	LOCATION	farm life , and the spiritual salvation of many .

		At a recent conference of
Vermont	LOCATION	librarians at
Northfield	LOCATION	, one of the speakers pointed out the need of the book - wagon in the Green Moun - tain
State	ORGANIZATION	, as one of the most efficient methods of counteracting the stagnation or retrogression which loyal sons of
Vermont	LOCATION	have lately been lamenting .

		ANOTHER FOREIGN TRIBUTE TO
WILLIAM JAMES	PERSON	takes the form of a book on his personality and his service to science , from the pen of
M. Emile Boutroux	PERSON	, psychologist of note and member of the
French Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		Highly as Professor
James	PERSON	was rated by many of his fellow-countrymen , he was held in still higher esteem abroad .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	has told of the eagerness with which the members of European and international conven - tions of philosophers demanded to see and hear ''
Veelliam Shames	PERSON	'' ; and his death was followed by notable appreciative and laudatory reviews of his life-work in foreign scientific journals .

		As
M. Boutroux	PERSON	's little book is written by one who knew and loved
William James	PERSON	in his lifetime , and was well able to understand the significance of his friend 's services to humanity , it should find many readers in this country , and indeed deserves to be translated and republished here a congenial task for some one of the master 's many disciples .

		His French admirer dwells especially on the harmony between
James	PERSON	the savant and author , and
James	PERSON	the man . ''

		As he talked , so he wrote , '' and to him , if to anyone , could be applied the words of Pascal : '' It is delightful , when one expects to see an author , to find a man . ''

		A SIGN OF THE TIMES AT YALE the
College	ORGANIZATION	founded two hundred and ten years ago by ten Con - necticut parsons for the education in godly learning of worthy young men , many of whom as almost a matter of course turned their academic training to the service of religion , and a considerable number of whom made a name for themselves in some de - partment of literature is the now threatened pre - ponderance of the scientific department , or
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	, over the department of arts and letters .

		At the recent commencement , the latter did indeed graduate a few more students than the former ; but next year the tables will be turned , as the class of
1912	DATE	numbers at present but two hun - dred and seventy-six members in the academic or literary section , against three hundred and twenty - seven in the
Sheffield School	ORGANIZATION	.

		So unmistakably has the complexion of the times changed since the Rev.
Abraham Pierson	PERSON	of
Killingworth	LOCATION	, the first Rector of the `` Collegiate School of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, '' received into his home a few youths of promise in the year
1701	DATE	, fifteen years before the official seat of said school was changed from Saybrook to
New Haven	LOCATION	, and seventeen years before its name became the one now known around the world .

		DICKENS AS REMEMBERED BY HIS SON , Mr.
Alfred Tennyson Dickens	PERSON	, is likely in the near future to be the subject of some interesting lectures in this country .

		The son , who has been living in
Australia	LOCATION	for f forty years , contemplates visiting
America	LOCATION	; and if his visit and his public talks on his father should fall in the centennial year of the latter 's birth , there would be a peculiar timeliness and probably an assured monetary success in the plan that might combine to render the younger
Dickens	PERSON	's impressions of our country and its people somewhat more favorable than were the elder 's .

		Among his auditors , too , there would perhaps be at least a sprinkling of those who had listened to his famous father in his American reading tour of forty-four years ago .

		A MIDSUMMER SYMPOSIUM OF LIBRARIANS from all parts of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	and the neighboring States has been plar.ned for the two weeks from
July 12 to July 26	DATE	, under the direction of the
Wisconsin Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		The quarters of the
Wiscon	PERSON	- sin
Library School	ORGANIZATION	at
Madison	ORGANIZATION	will be the scene of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, this conference , to which all interested in its dis - cussions are invited .

		A promising list of topics for lecture and debate has been prepared , and if this is not enough to whet the intellectual appetite there are other attractions in the programme of the
University Summer Session	ORGANIZATION	at the same time and place .

		A leaflet giving details of subjects and speakers for the library conference has been printed , and this , with any further information desired , may be had by applying to Miss
Mary E. Hazeltine	PERSON	, of the
Wisconsin Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, at
Madison	LOCATION	.

		The remoteness of
Pasadena	LOCATION	from the centre of American library activity made it impossible for some hitherto constant attendants at the
A. L. A.	PERSON	conference to be present at this year 's gathering , and it is hoped that this
Madison	PERSON	con - vention will partly make good their loss , especially for librarians in the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		A POET 'S LOG CABIN has been one of the less conspicuous sights of
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. , ever since
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	, now seventy years old and confined to a sick-bed in his
California	LOCATION	hillside home , built and occupied it almost forty years ago because he found himself uncomfortable in a house of the conventional pattern and with the conventional domestic equipment .

		On the high land near Six - teenth Street and
Florida Avenue	LOCATION	, on a piece of ground now owned by our ambassador to
France	LOCATION	, the songster of the Sierras found pure air and an unobstructed view in those early journalistic days of his exceedingly varied life , long before the wealth and fashion of the capital city had discovered , as it now has , that no finer sites than such a one as the eccentric writer had chosen could be desired for their suburban mansions .

		But this discovery of course means that the
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	cabin must go ; and accordingly the
California State Society	ORGANIZATION	of the city of
Washington	LOCATION	has taken steps to remove the structure to
Rock Creek Park	LOCATION	, where it is hoped it will long be preserved as a characteristic memento of its one-time distinguished occupant .

		A TRIUMPH FOB SPELLING REFORM is announced by the '' Simplified Spelling Bulletin '' in the con - version of the '' Ladies Home Journal '' to the cause ; and the '' Bulletin '' has '' herd a rumor '' of other cheering conquests .

		The prospects regarding ''
Milwaukee	LOCATION	spelling '' are reported as encouraging , and the cause is making headway in
Canada	LOCATION	among papers '' hitherto hostil '' to the idea .

		It appears that the ' established method of spelling makes English `` a foren tung , '' and the only cure is to have '' every word sounded as it is speld '' a reform which ought to be easy for a movement which has '' all the sense and all the lerning '' on its side .

		Among other entertaining matter in the '' offishal organ '' of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	is an account of a dinner recently given in
New York	LOCATION	, at which '' condenst items were red , '' and the '' catalog of vittles '' was '' intersperst '' with wise and witty remarks , notably those of '' the lerned and versatil Tresurer , '' at which '' abundant streams of wit and humor gusht forth . ''

		In the language of that pioneer of reformed spelling ,
Artemus Ward	PERSON	, '' let her gush ! ''

		... THE PAINSTAKING ''
LUCAS MALET	PERSON	'' has won for herself , by giving so much time and care to her rarely-appearing novels , a position of some distinc - tion in literature .

		That she is , in real life , Mrs.
St. Leger Harrison	PERSON	and daughter of
Charles King	PERSON	- sley , is well-known ; that she has for four years been engaged on a novel to be called ''
Adrian Savage	PERSON	, '' which her readers hope to see published in the
Autumn	DATE	, may not be so well known .

		It is described as a study of character rather than a narrative of events , and as treating certain recent developments in religious thought , in art , and in the position of women .

		The hero is a young
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Frenchman of literary tastes and pursuits , and some will be glad to be told in advance that his fortunes have a happy rather than an unhappy issue .

		Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	not unnaturally expects this product of her four or more years of labor to be her masterpiece .

		That it will be a strong book , as coming from the pen that wrote '' Sir
Richard Calmady	PERSON	, '' is almost a foregone conclusion ; but that it will not go to certain extremes -LRB- we will call them extremes of '' realism '' -RRB- attained in that powerful story , is a hope entertained by some of us .

		THE PASSING OF A SCHOLAR AND TEACHER like
Hiram Corson	PERSON	, professor emeritus of English literature at
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, who died on the fifteenth of
June	DATE	, in his eighty-fourth year , is a loss that can not easily be made good .

		It is forty - one years since Professor
Corson	PERSON	was called to
Ithaca	LOCATION	as professor of rhetoric and oratory , and for thirty-three of those years he was in active service as teacher of various allied subjects in the English department of the university .

		That he was an inspiring instructor no one can doubt who came under his personal influence or who has read any of his various works in interpretation of the great poets .

		His `` Primer of English Verse , '' published nearly twenty years ago , is widely known and valued , as are also his studies in
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	, which are said to have been com - mended by the poets themselves .

		He wrote much for the periodical press , and his contributions to THE DIAL were always welcome .

		DIAZ THE LIBRARIAN is far less known to the world than Diaz the soldier and the ruler of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Yet for a time , when he was pursuing his law stu - dies at the
Oaxaca Law Institute	ORGANIZATION	, he held the office of Librarian of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, being appointed to it by the governor of the district at a critical moment in the young man 's arduous course of self-training for higher destinies .

		Without this timely aid from Governor Juarez ,
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	would have been sorely pressed to find the means to defray the ex - penses of his law course .

		It was the same friendly
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL intercession that secured for him some rudimentary instruction in the military school at
Oaxaca	LOCATION	.

		Li - brarianship as a stepping stone to the presidency of one 's country is certainly out of the ordinary .

		IRVING 'S '' HEADLESS HORSEMAN 'S BRIDGE '' in the heart of Sleepy Hollow will soon he rebuilt as a memorial to the author who made it famous .

		Mr.
William Rockefeller	PERSON	has offered to give ten thousand dollars toward the construction of a bridge of granite and steel to perpetuate the memory of
Washington Irving	LOCATION	, or , rather , he has offered to defray the en - tire cost of such a memorial himself ; but the people of
Tarrytown	LOCATION	apparently wish to have a hand in the meritorious undertaking , and a popular subscription has been started there .

		Thus is our broad land slowly but surely becoming dotted with memorials that shall erelong relieve the nakedness of its traditionless youth , even though for many years still we shall continue to cross the ocean for a sight of ancient and mediaeval COMMUNICA TIONS .

		WILLIAM DE MORGAN ON HIMSELF .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Some time since I prepared a paper on
William De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	for our college faculty club , '' The Wranglers . ''

		A few weeks ago a copy of this effusion was forwarded to Mr.

		DEAR
MR. DICKINSON	PERSON	: Your valuable and valued notice of my performances had the narrowest escape of never being read by its subject !

		For it came to the above address during my winter absence in
Italy	LOCATION	, which has only just come to an end it has included
spring	DATE	and was shovelled by my caretaker here into a hideous mass of enclosures , chiefly advertisements , which are awaiting my examination and I hope I may find something else only half as interesting as your paper !

		You are quite right in accounting
J. Vance	PERSON	my best work , and I am satisfied that it will remain so .

		The conditions under which it was written can never recur .

		I am encumbered now not only with nay rapports with criticism , but even more by the constant question , '' Have I or have I not written all this before ? ''

		My memory of what I have written is unsound , and it does not do for a writer to repeat himself .

		There are one or two points resulting from news - paper enthusiasm for making statements that have crept into your text .

		I wish I had time to go through it with correction and send you the result .

		Just one or two things I will mention .

		My Frend grandfather certainly never endeavored to suppress the '' rebellion '' in the States .

		Catch him at it !

		He was an incarnate rebel himself .

		My father was not born on an island off
Java	LOCATION	, but at
Madura	LOCATION	, in the
Madras	LOCATION	Presidency .

		The story of
Campbell De	ORGANIZATION	M. forgetting people 's names is owing to confusing him with another relation , of whom I must have told the story .


Sophia Elizabeth De M.	PERSON	was my mother ; the fairy stories were by my sister
Mary De	PERSON	M. I never spoke to
Tennyson	LOCATION	in my life worse luck !

		And had only the privilege of mere acquaintance with
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		Carlyle was a neighbor and I saw him fairly frequently .

		I have in vain besought many interviewers to invent whatever they like about me , but not to bother me for data .

		What earthly use is a substratum of fact ?

		It is no use correcting the story that the MS. of
J. V.	PERSON	was typed after a publisher had rejected it !

		I never trust a MS. out of hands till it exists in duplicate .

		But I have no time to write at my full length .

		So must thank you again heartily for sending me your paper , and remain .

		Yours v ' y gratefully , WILLIAM DE MORGAN .

		THE PURPOSE OF `` WORLD LITERATURE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I point out an apparent misconception as to the purpose of my work on '' World Literature '' in the current issue of your journal ?

		The writer -LRB- page 480 -RRB- describes the work as too erudite `` for the class of readers for whom the book is intended , '' and a few lines further on seems to imply that the class for whom it is intended is '' Reading Clubs and Chautauquas . ''

		The argument of the Preface is that `` such World Literature belongs to every stage of culture , from the most elementary to the most advanced '' ; and the sec - tion of the book on '' The Place of World Literature in Education '' is mainly occupied with its application to the curricula of universities .

		A misconception of the scope of the work emanating from so influential a source as THE DIAL might seriously limit the chances of the book 's obtaining the attention of the classes for whom it is intended .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The comparison of verses by
W. G. Brown	PERSON	and
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, as printed in THE DIAL of
May 16	DATE	and
June 16	DATE	, to which attention was called by a correspondent in the last issue , reminds me that I have a third counter - part to offer .

		It is a waif , and authorless , so far as I know .

		It was printed on a torn newspaper fragment I once picked up on revisiting an old camping spot in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	overlooking the
Sugar River	LOCATION	.

		GRATITUDE .

		If a pilgrim has been shadowed By a tree that I have nursed , If a cup of clear cold water I have raised to lips athirst , If I 've planted one sweet flower By an else too barren way , If I 've whispered , in the
midnight	TIME	, One sweet word to tell of day , If in one poor bleeding bosom I a woe-swept chord have stilled , If one dark and restless spirit I with hope of heaven have filled , If I ' ve made , for life 's hard battle , One faint heart grow brave and strong , Then , my God , I thank Thee , bless Thee , For the precious gift of song .

		Does anyone know the author of this piece ?

		10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	,
WAGNER	PERSON	'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		* To the voluminous bibliography of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	including a legion of titles , to the six - volume official biography of the composer by
Glasenapp	PERSON	, the ten volumes of his own writings , and the twelve volumes of his letters to pub - lishers and friends , is now added his autobiog - raphy in two bulky volumes , under the simple title '' My Life . ''

		The genesis and development of these volumes are of unusual interest .

		They cover his life and career from
1813	DATE	to
1864	DATE	, based upon notes and a diary kept after
1835	DATE	, and now appear after forty years of silence .

		They were dictated , in
1873	DATE	, to
Cosima	LOCATION	, the daughter of Liszt , who was married to
Wagner	PERSON	, after her divorce from
Von Billow	LOCATION	, in
1869	DATE	.

		As
Wagner	PERSON	died in
1883	DATE	, the story of his life there - fore has remained untold for nineteen years .

		Twelve copies of the book were printed forty years ago , four of which were given to intimate friends and eight to
Cosima	LOCATION	, with the under - standing that they should not be made public until a stated time after
Wagner	PERSON	's death .

		It is to be regretted that he did not tell the whole story , for the omitted portion includes his rela - tions with
Ludwig	PERSON	, his royal patron , and his domestic life with
Cosima	PERSON	, to both of whom the barest reference is made .

		On reading this in - teresting and at times fascinating autobiog - raphy , one can not help wishing
Wagner	PERSON	had told the story of his relations with
Ludwig	PERSON	as circumstantially as he has told that of his youth and early manhood , and that of his life with
Cosima	PERSON	as intimately and frankly as he has described his experiences with the unfortunate
Minna Planer	PERSON	, his first wife , and his alleged platonic friendship with Mme.
Wesendonck	PERSON	.

		The story of
Wagner	PERSON	's early life is one of the most interesting portions of the autobiog - raphy .

		He frankly confesses his dissipations , quarrels , and youthful horseplay , '' the outward ugliness and inward emptiness of which make me marvel to this day . ''

		He makes no conceal - ment of his early passion for gambling , and the dishonest use of his mother 's pension , of which he was trustee , at the gaming table .

		By good fortune he won this money back .

		He never gambled again .

		He contritely says : '' No sense of shame deterred me from telling my mother , to whom I presented her money , the whole * MY LIFE .

		By
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with portraits .

		Authorized translation from the German .


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		truth about this decisive night .

		I voluntarily confessed my sin , in having utilised her pension , sparing no detail .

		She folded her hands and thanked God for His mercy , and forthwith regarded me as saved , believing it im - possible for me ever to commit such a crime again . ''

		And , truth to tell , gambling had lost all fascination for me from that moment .

		The world , in which I had moved like one demented , suddenly seemed stripped of all interest or attraction .

		My rage for gambling had already made me quite indifferent to the usual student 's vanities , and when I was freed from this passion also , I suddenly found myself face to face with an entirely new world . ''

		To this world I belonged henceforth : it was the world of real and serious musical study , to which I now devoted myself heart and soul . ''

		Equally frank is he in describing his duellistic encounters , his early love affairs , the details of which show that his love-making was decidedly practical rather than romantic , and his early attempts at writing poems and dramas of the most turgid and sensational sort , which greatly distressed his mother and frequently exposed him to the ridicule of friends and relatives .

		At last , however ,
Wagner	PERSON	found himself .

		Among the occasional visitors to the house was
Weber	PERSON	, of whom we have this picture : ''
Weber	PERSON	's really refined , delicate , and intellectual appearance excited my ecstatic admiration .

		His nar - row face and finely cut features , his vivacious though often half closed eyes , captivated and thrilled me ; while even the bad limp with which he walked , and which I often noticed from our windows when the mas - ter was making his way home past our house from the fatiguing rehearsals , stamped the great musician in my imagination as an exceptional and almost superhuman being .

		When , as a boy of nine , iny mother introduced me to him , and he asked me what I was going to be , whether 1 wanted perhaps to be a musician , my mother told him that , though I was indeed quite mad on ' Freischutz , ' yet she had as yet seen nothing in me which indicated any musical talent . ''


Weber	PERSON	's music made the first appeal to
Wagner	PERSON	.

		He says : '' '
Der Freischutz	PERSON	' in particular ap - pealed very strongly to my imagination mainly on account of its ghostly theme .

		The emotions of terror and the dread of ghosts formed quite an important factor in the development of my mind . ''

		He never lost his reverence for that great master and father of German music .

		After
Weber	PERSON	's death -LRB-
1826	DATE	-RRB- , an event which greatly distressed
Wagner	PERSON	, he came under the influence of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, of whom and his music he says : `` It was now
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's music that I longed to know more thoroughly ; I came to
Leipzig	LOCATION	and found his music to ' Egmont ' on the piano at my sister
Louisa 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		After that I tried to get hold of his sonatas .

		At last , at a concert at the Gewandhaus , I heard one of the master 's symphonies for the first time ; it was the sym - phony in A major .

		The effect on me was indescribable .

		To this must be added the impression produced on me
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ll by
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's features , which I saw in the lithographs that were circulated everywhere at that time , and by the fact that he was deaf , and lived a quiet , secluded life .

		I soon conceived an image of him in my mind as a sublime and unique supernatural being , with whom none could compare .

		This image was associated in my brain with that of Shakespeare ; in ecstatic dreams I met both of them , saw and spoke to them , and on awakening found myself bathed in tears . ''

		It was
Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	, however , rather than the music of `` Egmont '' or the A Major Symphony , which made the deepest impression upon the young
Wagner	PERSON	.

		He writes : `` Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony became the mystical goal of all my strange thoughts and desires about music .

		I was first attracted to it by the opinion prev - alent among musicians , not only in
Leipzig	LOCATION	but else - where , that this work had been written by
Beethoven	PERSON	when he was already half mad .

		It was considered the nan plus ultra of all that was fastastic and incompre - hensible , and this was quite enough to rouse in me a passionate desire to study this mysterious work .

		At the very first glance at the score , of which I obtained possession with much difficulty , I felt irresistibly at - tracted by the long-sustained pure fifths with which the first phrase opens : these chords , which , as I have related above , had played such a supernatural part in my childish impressions of music , seemed in this case to form a spiritual keynote of my life . ''

		Years afterward , the
Ninth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	and
Schroder	ORGANIZATION	- Devrient 's singing in '' Fidelio '' aroused in
Wagner	PERSON	the ambition to compose something which would give him a similar sat - isfaction .

		He says : '' In this mood I sketched an overture to '
Faust	PERSON	' which , according to my original scheme , was only to form the first part of a whole
Faust Symphony	ORGANIZATION	, as I had already got the '
Gretchen	PERSON	' idea in my head for the second movement .

		This is the same composition that I re - wrote in several parts fifteen years later ; I had forgotten all about it , and I owed its reconstruction to the advice of
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, who gave me many valuable hints . ''

		One more influence , and a powerful one , which came into
Wagner	PERSON	's young life is thus referred to : '' I came across
Mozart	PERSON	's ' Requiem ' which formed the starting point of my enthusiastic absorption in the works of that master .

		His second finale to '
Don Juan	PERSON	' inspired me to include him in my spirit world .

		I was now filled with a desire to compose , as I had before been to write verse ... My future distinction would be to win the titles of conductor and writer of operas . ''

		Thus early did
Wagner	PERSON	forecast his future .

		Space does not allow even the sketching of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's musical career or the great results which he accomplished .

		Indeed , these volumes add but little to what is already known of
Wagner	PERSON	as a composer .

		The story is so familiar that many of the pages devoted to it are dry and monotonous , though they give us interesting glimpses of the master in his work - shop and of his constructive methods .

		It would have been interesting to have his critical esti - mate of his contemporaries : but he only alludes to a few , and briefly at that .

		He expresses generous appreciation of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, but is somewhat indifferent toward
Schumann	LOCATION	.

		He was inclined to think that '' HaleVy was simply a man whose youthful talent was only stimulated to achieve one great success with the object of becoming rich ... Only once did
Hale	PERSON	`` vy speak to me with real candor , when , on my tardy de - parture for
Germany	LOCATION	, he wished me the success he thought my works deserved . ''

		Of
Spontini	ORGANIZATION	's conducting , he says : ''
Spontini	PERSON	's method was based upon the absolutely correct system -LRB- which even at the present time is mis - understood by some German orchestras -RRB- of spreading the string quartette over the whole orchestra .

		This system further consisted in preventing the brass and percussion instruments from culminating in one point -LRB- and drowning each other -RRB- by dividing them on both sides , and by placing the more delicate wind instruments at a judicious distance from each other , thus forming a chain between the violins . ''

		For a long time he entertained a dislike for
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	, and pronounced him a vulgar time - beater ; but a performance of the '' Symphonic Fundbre et Triomphale '' convinced him of '' the greatness and enterprise of this incomparable artist . ''

		The overpowering brass effects in this composition evidently attracted him .

		He wasted no love upon Meyerbeer or his music , though
Meyerbeer	PERSON	was very good to him when he was in dire straits in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		When
Wagner	PERSON	first saw '' The Prophet , '' he got up in the middle of an act and left the house . ''

		I was filled with rage and despair at the thought that I should be called upon to listen to such a thing , and never again did I pay the slightest heed to this opera . ''

		He pays a left-handed compliment to
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	after the failure of his own ''
Tann	PERSON	- hauser '' in
Paris	LOCATION	: '' With
Gounod	PERSON	alone did I still continue on friendly terms , and I heard that he energetically championed my cause in society .

		He is said on one occasion to have ex - claimed : ' Que Dieu me donne une pareille chute . ''

		As an acknowledgment of this advocacy I presented him with the score of ' Tristan und Isolde , ' being all the more gratified by his behaviour because no feeling of friendship had ever been able to induce me to hear his ' Faust . ' ''

		It is astonishing to read
Wagner	PERSON	's only allusion to
Brahms	PERSON	.

		Did he , like
Schumann	PERSON	, recognize in him another musical Messiah , and '' new paths '' ?

		On the eve of a concert in
Vienna	LOCATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	needed copyists .

		Tausig mentioned
Brahms	PERSON	, '' recommending him as a ' very good fellow , ' who , although he was so famous himself , would willingly take over a part of their -LSB- the other copyists ' -RSB- work , and a selection from the 12 THE DIAL -LSB- Julyl , * Meistersinger ' was accordingly allotted to him .

		And , indeed ,
Brahms	PERSON	's behaviour proved un - assuming and good-natured , but he showed little vivacity and was often hardly noticed at our gatherings . ''

		As already said , the Autobiography throws little new light upon
Wagner	PERSON	the musician .

		His multitude of friends and his equal multi - tude of enemies have taken good care that posterity shall know him from that point of view , though it may be affirmed that the '' music of the future '' is the music of the present , the impressionists and ultra-modernists to the contrary notwithstanding .

		Taken as a whole , however , we get a good impression of
Wagner	PERSON	the man .

		He was a lover of the fantastic , and his favorite story-writers were
Grimm	PERSON	and
Hoffman	PERSON	.

		He was greatly inclined to mysticism , with occasional demoniacal ten - dencies .

		He says : '' From my earliest childoood certain mysterious and uncanny things exercised an enormous influence over me .

		If I were left alone in a room for long , I remem - ber that , when gazing at lifeless objects such as pieces of furniture , and concentrating my attention upon them , I would suddenly shriek out with fright , because they seemed to me alive . ''

		Of an experience in
Spezia	LOCATION	, in
1859	DATE	, he writes : '' Suddenly I seemed to be sinking in swift-running water .

		The rushing water took on the musical sound of an E flat major chord , which was tossed hither and thither by the waves , and continually breaking up into melodious variations of ever-increasing movement , yet never losing the perfect harmony of the chord , which , by its pertinacity , appeared to wish to impart some in - finite signification to the element in which I was sinking .

		With the sensation of waves rearing high above my head , I awoke in a fright from the trance .

		Then I immediately recognized that the orchestral prelude to '
Das Rheingold	PERSON	, ' which had long been in me , but which I had never been able to properly find , had arisen . ''

		Notwithstanding the grim earnestness of
Wagner	PERSON	, his humor was always good natured , as is evidenced by many playful allusions to musicians he met .

		He greatly loved animals .

		His gray parrot nearly restored peace in his relations with
Minna	PERSON	his wife , for `` this sociable bird , which had no vices and was an apt scholar , '' together `` with a pretty little dog , born on the day of the first '
Rienzi	PERSON	' rehearsal in
Dresden	LOCATION	, did much to brighten our dwelling in the absence of children .

		My wife soon taught the bird snatches of songs from '
Rienzi	PERSON	, ' with which it would good naturedly greet me from a distance when it heard me coming up the stairs . ''

		He had an intense affection for his little dog Peps , and devotes much space to a description of
Peps	ORGANIZATION	's last hours , and his inter - ment in the landlady 's garden , where he was buried with his basket and cushions .

		Four years later ,
Wagner	PERSON	revisited the spot , but found no trace of his '' little friend 's '' grave , much to his regret .

		The Autobiography is replete with Wag - ner 's wretched experiences with
Minna	PERSON	.

		They quarrelled up to the hour of the wedding ; they came near quarrelling during the ceremony ; they quarrelled ever after like cat and dog .

		He accuses her of infidelity , and intimates that
Netta	PERSON	, whom she passed off as her sister , was in reality her own daughter .

		She did not understand him nor sympathize with him .

		He says : '' I always felt somewhat distressed , uncomfortable , and ill at ease , whenever I tried to pass a few pleasant hours in the society of my wife ... The strange power she exercised over me from the very first was in no wise due to the fact that I regarded her in any way as the embodiment of my ideal ; on the contrary , she attracted me by the soberness and seriousness of her character , which supplemented what I felt to be want - ing in my own , and afforded me the support that in my wanderings after the ideal I knew to be necessary for me . ''

		Perhaps this explains one of the causes of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's wretchedness .

		He was wandering after the ideal , and she after the real .

		In their pathetic life in
Paris	LOCATION	,
Minna	PERSON	did all she could to keep his head above water , and their mutual privations , which she endured with more cour - age than her husband , brought them nearer together .

		Perhaps they might have lived with each other some years longer ; but
Madam Wesendonck	PERSON	now comes into his life , and his intimacy with her which he contends was innocent , though more than once it provoked discord in the Wesendonck household at last roused
Minna	PERSON	's furious jealousy of his affinity , and the separation was inevitable .

		Wagner describes his life with
Minna	PERSON	with the most brutal frankness , and with as close detail as if he were on the witness-stand .

		Assuming all he says of
Minna	LOCATION	to be true , yet he knew all about her before he married her .

		She may have been his intellectual inferior ; this he also knew .

		She was not of the kind to make a good wife ; neither was he of the kind to make a good husband .

		Musicians who marry actresses usually make a mess of it .

		She did much for him ; it can not be said , however , that he did much if anything for her .

		The honest reader will remember that
Wagner	PERSON	had the last word .

		There is no
Minna Planer	PERSON	, or friend of MinnaPlaner 's , to tell her side of the story .

		Audi alter am partem .

		The sad part of it is that we can not .

		Evidently
Wagner	PERSON	has presented these
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 sordid and pathetic details in self - justification .

		Whether or not he has succeeded must be left to the reader .

		And now
Cosima	PERSON	comes into his life , with whom he is to '' live happy ever after '' as the story-books say .

		But of her we first hear only this : `` While I. was singing < Wotan 's Abschied ' to my friends I noticed the same expression on Cosima 's face as I had seen on it , to my astonishment , in
Zurich	LOCATION	on a similar occasion , only the ecstacy of it was transfigured into something higher .

		Everything connected with this was shrouded in silence and mystery ; but the belief that she belonged to me grew to such certainty in my mind that when I was under the influence of more than ordinary excitement my conduct betrayed the most reck - less gayety .

		As I was accompanying
Cosima	PERSON	to the hotel across a public square I suddenly suggested she should sit in an empty wheelbarrow which stood in the street , so that I might wheel her to the hotel .

		She assented in an instant .

		My astonishment was so great that I felt all my courage desert me , and was unable to carry out my mad project . ''

		Near the close of the second volume
Wagner	PERSON	refers briefly to
Cosima	LOCATION	again at a time when he was visiting the Biilows in
1863	DATE	. ''

		As Billow had to complete the preparations to his concert , I drove out alone with
Cosima	PERSON	on the prom - enade , as before , in a fine carriage .

		This time all our jocularity died away into silence .

		We gazed speechless into each other 's eyes ; an intense longing for an avowal of the truth mastered us and led to a confession which needed no words of the boundless unbappiness which oppressed us . ''

		Still briefer is
Wagner	PERSON	's allusion to
King Ludwig	PERSON	which forms the closing sentence in the Autobiography .

		After a short statement of the circumstances attending his invitation to meet
Ludwig	PERSON	, he says : '' On the same day I had received the most urgent warnings against returning to
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		But my life was to have no more of these alarms ; the dangerous road along which fate beckoned me to such great ends was not destined to be clear of troubles and anxieties of a kind unknown to me heretofore , but I was never again to feel the weight of the everyday hardships of existence under the protection of my exalted friend . ''

		In summing up this extraordinary Autobiog - raphy extraordinary for its frankness , its confessions , its honesty , its self-unsparingness it must be called a plain tale of a life which is laid bare to the minutest detail , in the most unegotistic manner , and has been written evidently because the hero of the story felt it necessary that posterity should understand him and that history should present him in a true light , nothing extenuating , and setting down naught in malice .

		Another impression that must inevitably come to the reader is of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's literary skill .

		A musician once said of
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	, that one of the greatest violinists in the world was lost in the making of one of the greatest conductors .

		It may similarly be said of
Wagner	PERSON	, that one of the most skilful literary artists in the world was lost in the making of one of the greatest composers .

		Weinlich , one of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's early teachers , said to him : '' Probably you will never write fugues or canons ; but what you have mastered is independence .

		You can now stand alone . ''

		That independence was manifest all through
Wagner	PERSON	's life , and impressed itself upon all his contemporaries as in the case of no other composer since
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		In all his voluminous writings , he has never written better , or clearer , or with more literary skill , than in the book he dictated to
Cosima	LOCATION	.

		It should be supplemented by another , telling the story of his life from
1864	DATE	to
1883	DATE	, with which no one is more familiar , and for which no one has ampler material than
Cosima	LOCATION	.

		No autobiography was needed to establish
Wagner	PERSON	's musical fame as the greatest operatic composer of the nineteenth century .

		He is an epoch-maker like
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has indelibly stamped his influence upon operatic music and permanently changed its course .

		He has restored the old Grecian artistic unity , and reinforced and symmetrized the art of music by bringing other art-forms into harmony with it .

		As I have said in another place , he has abolished conventional forms and '' substituted a poetry full of music and a music full of poetry ; and both are exquisitely set forth against a pictorial background where illusion is almost lost in reality . ''


Wagner	PERSON	had no need to justify his music .

		If it were necessary to justify himself , it must be acknowledged that he has done so frankly and courageously , and with the assur - ance that characterizes one who has sublime faith in himself .

		Like
Horace	PERSON	, he might have added to the story of '' My Life , '' '' Exegi monumentum perennius cere . ''

		A NEW TEXT OF
POE	ORGANIZATION	'S POEMS .

		* The claim has been made for more than one edition of
Poe	PERSON	that it contains every scrap of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's writings ; and it was predicted a good many years ago by one of
Poe	PERSON	's editors that no '' new and well-authenticated poem '' from his pen would ever again be found .

		Yet Mr.
J. H.	PERSON	* THE COMPLETE POEMS OF
EDGAR ALLAN POE	PERSON	.

		Col - lected , edited , and arranged , with memoir , textual notes , and bibliography , by
J. H. Whitty	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		14 THE D1AJL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	,
Whitty	PERSON	has brought together in his recent edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's verses a full half-dozen new poems .

		None of these possesses much intrinsic worth , and one is a fragment of only three lines ; but Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	's feat is , nevertheless , a notable one .

		Two of the new poems were dis - covered in manuscript copies in the desk used by
Poe	PERSON	while editor of the '' Southern Literary Messenger '' ; three were published in magazines with which
Poe	PERSON	was connected ; and one is from an obscure periodical published at
Providence	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, in
1848	DATE	.

		Included in the edition , also , are the two skits addressed by
Poe	PERSON	to his
Baltimore	LOCATION	cousin ,
Elizabeth Herring	PERSON	, and the two songs from
Poe	PERSON	's tale , '' Four Beasts in One , '' hitherto ignored by editors of the poems .

		Scarcely less remarkable than the discovery of these poems is the disclosure of a number of new variant readings .

		These are drawn in part from manuscripts until now either unknown or inaccessible to the editors , in part from sundry printed versions of the poems heretofore quite overlooked by both editors and bibliographers .

		The most interesting of these are versions of '' The Raven '' and '' Dream - Land '' published in the
Richmond	LOCATION	'' Examiner '' in the
autumn of 1849	DATE	, and texts of twelve other poems which were intended for publication in the '' Examiner '' and are preserved in revised proofs made for that purpose .

		Here also are recorded for the first time the variant readings found in the '' Flag of our Union , '' a file of which was discovered several summers ago in
Washington	LOCATION	-LRB- see `` The Nation '' of
December 30 , 1910	DATE	-RRB- .

		Other new readings are furnished by the
Baltimore	LOCATION	'' Sat - urday Morning Visiter '' for
1833	DATE	, the
London	LOCATION	'' Critic '' for
1845	DATE	, the
Richmond	LOCATION	'' Whig '' for
1849	DATE	, and `` Leaflets of Memory '' for
1850	DATE	.

		Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	has also collected a good deal of fresh information about
Poe	PERSON	's life .

		The chief source of this information is the manuscript '' Recollections of
E. A. Poe	PERSON	'' by
F. W. Thomas	PERSON	, now at last become available .

		These reminis - cences tend to corroborate
Poe	PERSON	's story of a trip to
Europe	LOCATION	in
1827	DATE	, which most of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's editors have believed to be apocryphal ; and they also furnish valuable information about
Poe	PERSON	's activ - ities in
Baltimore	LOCATION	during the obscure years fol - lowing his expulsion from West Point in
1831	DATE	.

		From other sources mainly newspapers of the time new particulars are brought out about
Poe	PERSON	's relations with Mrs.
Osgood	PERSON	and Mrs.
Shelton	PERSON	.

		A number of unpublished letters are drawn on for new details about his early life in
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		An interesting theory advanced is that the '' Lines Written in an Album , '' pub - lished in the `` Messenger '' in
September , 1835	DATE	, were really inspired by
Virginia Clemm	PERSON	, and not by
Eliza White	PERSON	, as has been generally assumed .

		It is also suggested that
Poe	PERSON	's father either had died or had deserted his family before the sum - mer of
1811	DATE	.

		Where so much was attempted , it was inevitable that some errors should creep in .

		The chief of these appear in the appendix .

		In the textual notes there are a number of mis - prints and some slight inaccuracies .

		Among errors inherited from other editions are the spell - ing Petrarchmanities for '' Petrarchan ities , '' in the variorum of `` An Enigma '' -LRB- p. 237 -RRB- ; the substitution of `` To '' for `` For '' in the sixth line of the
1829	DATE	revision of '' A Dream within a Dream '' -LRB- p. 274 -RRB- , and of '' Now '' for `` Nor '' in the last stanza of the
1829	DATE	version of the lines beginning '' I heed not that my earthly lot '' -LRB- p. 279 -RRB- ; and the omission of the line '' Silent waterfalls '' in the last stanza of the
1831	DATE	version of `` Fairy-land '' -LRB- p. 282 -RRB- .

		In the variorum for '' The Raven '' the read - ings for the '' Southern Literary Messenger '' -LRB-
March , 1845	DATE	-RRB- are overlooked .

		And it is open to question whether the editor has not erred sometimes in the selection of his text .

		In the case of '' An Enigma , '' for example , the Gris - wold text must surely represent
Poe	PERSON	's latest revision ; the same holds true of the later lines '' To
Helen	PERSON	, '' unless we are to adopt the very improbable theory that
Griswold	PERSON	deliberately interpolated a couple of lines of his own making .

		In two instances in the last line of ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	'' and in the twenty-second line of `` Spirits of the Dead '' the editor has rejected the reading of the text that he has adopted ; in both instances , one must think , on insufficient grounds .

		In the bibliography , mention should be made of the text of '' A Valentine '' which appeared in the `` Evening Mirror '' for
Febru	PERSON	- ary 21 ,
1846	DATE	; and of the excerpts from '' Politian '' in the '' Southern Magazine '' of
November , 1875	DATE	, and in the
New York	LOCATION	issue of
J. H. Ingram	PERSON	's edition of the poems .

		Aside from these defects , the edition is an admirable one , and should supersede all former editions of the poems .

		That it will come to be recognized as final , it would be rash to predict : where Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	was able to garner so bounti - ful a harvest , it may fall to yet other laborers in the field to collect some small gleanings .

		But at least we may predict that no such feat as Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	's will soon again be accom - plished .

		15 MEMOIRS OF A CONFEDERATE BRIGADIER .

		* General
Hagood	PERSON	, commander of the famous
Hagood	PERSON	's Brigade of the
Confederate Army	ORGANIZATION	, died in
1898	DATE	.

		He had declined to permit the publication of his memoirs until after his death ; a decision which was doubtless due to modesty on his part , but , in the judgment of the present writer , one to be regretted .

		In his Introduction , dated
March 21 , 1871	DATE	,
General Hagood	ORGANIZATION	tells us that the papers of his brigade '' were preserved in the general wreck of Confederate military affairs , '' but adds : '' These memoirs are not prepared for the printer ; nor will they , or any part of them , while I control them , be made public . ''

		It is better , however , that a narrative should be published during the life-time of the writer , both for his sake and for the sake of his contemporaries ; as thus an opportunity will be afforded for the correction of any mistakes that may have crept in .

		But we are glad to have these stirring memoirs , even at this late date ; and doubtless the surviving members of
Hagood	ORGANIZATION	's Brigade are glad to have their war-records preserved .

		The work consists of two parts , the first cover - ing the history of the
First Regiment of South Carolina	ORGANIZATION	volunteers -LRB- twelve months ' men -RRB- ,
April 12 , 1861	DATE	to
April 12 , 1862	DATE	; and the second , the history of
Hagood 's Brigade	ORGANIZATION	, as it was organized on
September 30 , 1863	DATE	, consist - ing of the llth , 21st , 25th , and 27th regiments , and the 7th battalion -LRB- eight companies -RRB- of
South Carolina	LOCATION	volunteers , numbering 4,246 men .

		The history of the brigade begins prop - erly with the campaign of
1864	DATE	in
Virginia	LOCATION	, the regiments having previously served on
Morris Island	LOCATION	in
Charleston Harbor	LOCATION	.

		They had there done all that was required of them ; but a wider field of action was opened when they were transferred to
Virginia	LOCATION	, and they were put into a fight as soon as they reached Port Walthal Junction , on the 6th of
May , 1864	DATE	.

		The brunt of this action fell upon
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade ; and in the progress of the narrative it will be seen that it saved
Peters	PERSON	- burg . ''

		General
Hagood	PERSON	says -LRB- page 226 -RRB- : '' The brigade did acquit itself well .

		It was its first fight upon
Virginia	LOCATION	soil , and a credit - able letter of introduction to the battle-scarred veterans of Lee . ''

		Actions at
Swift Creek	LOCATION	,
Drury	ORGANIZATION	's Bluff , and on the lines of
Bermuda	LOCATION	Hundred , are described , and presently we reach * MEMOIRS OF THE WAR OF SECESSION .

		From the Original Manuscripts of
Johnson Hagood	PERSON	, Brigadier General
C.S. A. Columbia	PERSON	, S. C. :
The State Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		the battle of
Cold Harbor	LOCATION	, where
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade lost 16 killed , 103 wounded , and 9 missing , making an aggregate of 128 men . ''

		Grant 's severe losses and small success had a powerful effect on the Northern mind , and it is asserted by Federal historians that at this time the war was near a collapse , from which successes elsewhere alone saved it . ''

		An ac - count of the battle of Petersburg follows , and a description is given of life in the trenches there , much more trying to the men than battle itself .

		The battle of
Weldon Road	ORGANIZATION	shortly followed , in which
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade especially distin - guished itself , and
General Beauregard	ORGANIZATION	spoke of its commander in the highest terms .

		After a short rest in the rear , and after the taking of
Fort Harrison	LOCATION	,
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade was trans - ferred to the north side of
James River	LOCATION	, where it remained until the end of that year , when , with the rest of
Hoke	PERSON	's division , it was sent to
Wilmington	LOCATION	to aid in the defense of
Fort Fisher	LOCATION	, although not stationed in the fort , but at
Wilmington	LOCATION	, in reserve .

		As Grant had now relieved
Butler	PERSON	, a renewal of the attempt against Fort
Fisher	PERSON	was made by
Terry	PERSON	with about 8000 men .

		Bragg ordered
Hoke	PERSON	to attack the enemy 's new line , but the latter deemed the attempt inadvisable , and at
Hoke	ORGANIZATION	's request
Bragg	ORGANIZATION	reconnoitered it , and as he concurred with
Hoke	PERSON	, the garrison was left to its fate .

		This necessitated the evacuation of
Wilmington	LOCATION	.

		Bragg returned to
Richmond	LOCATION	, leaving
Hoke	PERSON	in command at
Wilmington	LOCATION	, and
Hagood	PERSON	at
Fort Anderson	LOCATION	, some miles below ; but on
Hagood	PERSON	's advice this fort was evacuated , and a position taken up on
Town Creek	LOCATION	some six miles above , but it was not held long , and the Confederates withdrew to
Kinston	LOCATION	, on the
Neuse River	LOCATION	, between
Newbern	PERSON	and
Goldsboro	LOCATION	.


Hoke	PERSON	's division , including
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade , finally fell back to
Smithfield	ORGANIZATION	and joined
General Johnston	ORGANIZATION	's command .

		The remnants of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	's army , some 5000 men ;
Hardee	ORGANIZATION	's forces , which had marched from
Savannah	LOCATION	and
Charleston	LOCATION	, 11,000 men ; and
Bragg	LOCATION	's forces of 8000 men , with
Wheeler	PERSON	's and
Butler	PERSON	's 4000 cavalrymen , formed an army of 28,000 men with which to resist
Sherman	PERSON	's 75,000 .

		The battle of
Bentonville	LOCATION	followed , the last ex - piring effort of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the West , and of all Confederate troops south of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		In this battle
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade lost 249 men killed , wounded , and missing ; and soon after - wards General
Hagood	PERSON	was sent to
South Carolina	LOCATION	to collect absentees .

		But it was too 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, late .


Hagood	PERSON	's farewell order was dated
March 30	DATE	, in which he informed his men that he should be absent forty days ; but before that time elapsed ,
Lee	PERSON	had surrendered and the
Southern Confederacy	LOCATION	had no more use for soldiers .

		General
Hagood	PERSON	's memoirs close with ex - tracts from the diary of
Captain Storey	LOCATION	, includ - ing General
Johnston	PERSON	's Order of
April 27th	DATE	, announcing his '' military convention '' with
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	, which came to naught , and he surrendered on the same terms that
Grant	ORGANIZATION	had extended to Lee .

		The work concludes with a roster of the several regiments that constituted
Hagood	PERSON	's brigade , a poem by
Joseph Blyth Allston	PERSON	, en - titled '' Charge of
Hagood	PERSON	's Brigade , '' written in the
summer of 1864	DATE	, soon after the charge referred to , '' which was always considered by the brigade as their most desperate encounter , '' and two views of the monument erected to the brigade near
Petersburg	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		A long list of
Errata	LOCATION	is given , but a frequent one , '' dr. '' for '' pdr. , '' is omitted .

		CURRENTS OF THE SOCIAL , UNDERWORLD .

		*
The American Institute of Criminal Law	ORGANIZATION	and Criminology , organized in
1910	DATE	, starts upon its hopeful career with the establishment of a journal worthy of American scholarship , and with the publication in English of two strong works by European specialists .


Spain	LOCATION	, now thoroughly awake and eager to contribute to the growth of science , furnishes us an admirable presentation of '' Modern Theories of Crimin - ality , '' together with a useful and carefully se - lected and annotated bibliography which reveals wide and critical reading .

		The chief interest in criminology formerly centred in the criminal law ; now the offender himself is in the focus of illumination and attention .

		The law-breaker is a puzzle to all , and especially to himself .

		At times he appears to be an inhabitant of some other world , here on a flying visit , and the uni - verse where he is most at home is one where trees grow with roots in the air , blackbirds are white , and honor is awarded to evil ; at another time he reminds us of something which has hap - pened in our own minds and has come near to * THE MODERN CRIMINAL SCIENCE SERIES .

		First vol - umes : Modern Theories of Criminality , by
C. Bernaldo	PERSON	de Quir6s , translated from the Spanish by
Alfonso de Salvio	PERSON	, with an Introduction by

		breaking out in action under dire stress .

		The trouble with our generalizations about criminals is that they are of so many patterns , and no one description will apply to all ; their name is legion for demons are many .

		Discrimination and classification must be the first study of those who would understand the underworld whose sulphur makes us all uncomfortable , and from whose mysterious depths our foes creep forth at night to rob , steal , cheat , and kill .

		We should like to ignore the entire disagreeable crowd , and sit by our cheerful hearths listening to sacred poets and to the prattle of our inno - cent children .

		But if we do go deeply into the history of the law-breaker , he becomes actually fascinating , as do the monstrous gargoyles which thrust their hideous faces out of gothic cathedrals .

		To understand the criminal we must dissect his body and soul , and observe how he acts in all kinds of weather , under tempt - ation , at play , and while he lives the placid life of the prison .

		Over this complex problem of criminal anthropology warring schools have set them - selves in battle array .

		Now and then the smoke clears , and the antagonists shake hands like gentlemen and appropriate a larger fund of ideas .

		In time we have a synthesis ; frag - ments are fitted in to a provisional system which works fairly well in practice , but which , like a house built for a growing family , must often be repaired and enlarged .

		The intellectual activity in this field is amazing , and the book of our Spanish interpreter will enable a student to gain a swift and fairly complete view of the investigations and discussions .

		It is possible that little will be left of
Lombroso	LOCATION	's generaliza - tions about the '' born criminal '' when his critics are through with him , but everyone must admit that such gadflies of irritating suggestion are rare in any century .

		It is forever impossible to go back to the notions of criminals which were assumed in the ancient law-books and systems of penology .

		The
American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology	ORGANIZATION	has done wisely in starting its series of translations of books relating to its field of research with the remarkably clear , instructive , readable , and impartial analysis of '' Modern Theories of Criminality , '' by
Bernaldo de Quiros	ORGANIZATION	.

		Passing to the learned and witty book of the great German jurist
Hans Gross	PERSON	, we must be on our guard lest the title through no fault of the author mislead us .

		The title-page properly describes the work as a manual for judges , practitioners , and students ; it is not de -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		17 signed , nor is it wholly adapted , to penologists ; its chief value is for the court .

		Indeed , the criminal is by no means the only personality under inspection : not only the person charged with crime , but also the witnesses on both sides , the examining lawyers , the editors who report and comment , and most of all the judge himself , are included in the survey .

		There is little of direct value to the prison warden or teacher in the book , although it can be studied by such officials with profit .

		Students of human nature , psychologists , teachers , parents , tradesmen , bankers , any of us may find sceptical hints which will tend to make us cautious about believ - ing too far in our senses or our neighbors .

		To go through life without being too often swindled , cheated , wronged , hurt , deceived , we must learn to interpret the outward signs of real thoughts and feelings and purposes of people we meet .

		The analogues of crime , and even crime itself , are matters of constant and universal concern .

		The banker who is asked for a credit must be able to discover , from all kinds of looks and gestures and information about habits and associates , what the borrower would probably do with the money .

		The adjuster of fire and life and accident insurance learns to be suave and suspicious .

		The foreman in a factory or the conductor of a train must guide his conduct in relation to others by what they reveal of their character , and by intuitions .

		In fact , suc - cess in life depends on this ability to judge men , and all of us try to cultivate it ; even children do so .


Hans Gross	PERSON	has given us a volume which gathers up homely proverbs , the studies of
Darwin	PERSON	on the expression of the emotions , the results of experiments in psychological lab - oratories , the observations of those in charge of the insane and of criminals , and gives a scientific form to common knowledge .

		All this erudition is enlivened by shrewd hints , laughable situa - tions , keen and even cynical criticism of human life .

		No one will claim that we have here at all points the last word of exact science in this field ; but we do discover an indispensable and efficient method of research .

		The language is intelligible , and as free as possible from esoteric technical terms .

		Generally the conclusions can be tested by experiment in any court-room .

		The results are stated with so much caution that testimony seems to shrink in value .

		Shakespeare saw how easy it was to lie . ''

		Ac - cording to
Helmholtz	PERSON	, the power of the full moon is not more than that of a candle twelve feet away .

		And how much people claim to have seen by moonlight ! ''

		The veracious man is not only one who desires to tell the fact , but takes pains to know the fact .

		Thus the crim - inalist offers instruction in morality .

		Social defense means protection of the inno - cent from false charges arising from envy , hate , prejudice , passion , interest , and , on the other hand , efforts to discover , identify , and convict the real authors of actions harmful to the commun - ity .

		A crime is an overt act ; the worst and most dangerous man can not be sent to prison as a convict on his evil reputation or because he has the '' stigmata . ''

		The government prose - cution must reproduce the story of the deed with sufficient fulness and evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused stood in causal relation to the act as charged in the indictment .

		To reach this conclusion , numberless sources of error must be avoided , difficulties in perception and memory and judgment must be overcome , prejudice and revenge must be discounted .

		The work of
Hans Gross	ORGANIZATION	renders a valuable service to social security by its profound and penetrat - ing disclosures of the value of testimony , by its critical treatment of the sources of informa - tion , by its severe tests of accepted errors , and by its positive directions for discovering the truth in spite of all these perils .

		The English version of the book , by Mr.
H. M. Kallen	PERSON	, is fitly introduced to American readers by Dr.
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	.

England	LOCATION	would ever think of beginning his boarding-school -LRB- Anglice public-school -RRB- life with the brewing of a cup of tea ?

		He writes : '' Towards evening my father left me , and I had tea in my new abode .

		Seldom have I felt greater satisfac - tion with myself and my surroundings .

		I admired everything the kettle , candlestick , and snuffers , stamped with the first and last letters of my name , the tea-cannister , the solid crockery , the knives and spoons , marked in the same way with a double L L .

		After tea I canted one of the kitchen chairs against the wall arm-chairs were not in those days allowed and read by the light of the dip , feeling that I was at last an independent gentleman .

		I was occasionally surprised by one or two heads being poked in at the door and being suddenly withdrawn , but nothing happened till I went to bed . ''

		The second day was not so rosy , as I was subjected to the constant and often contemptuous interrogation of ' W hat 's your name , and where do you board ? '

		and sometimes to the disquieting question of ' Do you take a licking ? ' ''

		An early sign of poetic aspirations in the
Eton	LOCATION	lad showed itself in a prize poem on '' The Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	' Visit to
America	LOCATION	, '' from which we are favored with a few specimen lines : '' He sees the lions of the place , the falls , He visits , lays foundations , goes to balls , Dances with blundering damsels in quadrilles , Makes shooting parties to the neighboring hills .

		Ladies admire the beauty of his nose , Gentlemen take pattern from his clothes . ''

		Could any subsequent and more worthy per - formance in verse have caused the poet such thrills of pride and joy as this achievement in -LRB- not always perfect -RRB- rhyme ?

		On the same page with these lines are three others which Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	quotes , probably with a chuckle of even greater amusement .

		They are from an epic on
David	PERSON	and Goliath , and were written '' by a large boy with sandy whiskers and moustache , who was notoriously unscholastic . ''

		There is something in their '' canine simplicity , '' as Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	remarks , that strikes one as little short of Homeric . ''

		Turn dixit
David	PERSON	, volo pugnare Goliath .

		Respondit Saulus , non potes vincere monstrum .

		Sed dixit
David	PERSON	, ego possum vincere monstrum . ''

		Passing from these trivialities , we come to the more serious studies of the ambitious Balliol student .

		Philosophy , which is poetry addressed to the understanding , exerted its seductive charms on him when he became a disciple of
T. H. Green	ORGANIZATION	; and the compelling personality of
Jowett	PERSON	failed not of its due effect , especially when he joined a vacation reading-party under the great man 's supervision .

		Of these two eminent scholars and teachers the author has con - siderable to say , finally contrasting them thus : '' It would be difficult to find two men more unlike than
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Jowett	PERSON	.


Jowett	PERSON	was very different from an ordinary Englishman , resembling in everything but the austerity of his morals an abbe * of the old French type , a would-be man of the world , brilliant with a sort of silvery radiance , taking an intellectual rather than sympathetic interest in men and things .

		With all his virtue he was hardly a man , and one could not imagine him ever having gone wrong or ever filling any other post but that of a
Don	PERSON	.

		Green , on the other hand , was a Briton to the back bone , of the old Puritan type .

		He had a rather dark stern face thatched with a shock of iron-grey hair , with a firmly-built body , which might , if he had exercised it , have been athletic .

		He was silent and expressed himself with difficulty , but you had no doubt of the depth of his sympathy , and felt that except for his practised self-control he was a man of like pas - sions with yourself ...
Jowett	PERSON	was always the revered schoolmaster , in whose company we endeavoured to be virtuous for fear of exciting his displeasure .

		But Green was an elder brother , in whose society we were ashamed to be selfish or mean , and who taught rather by example than precept . ''

		In the obligatory essay-writing of his course at
Balliol	LOCATION	, Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	recalls that , like many others of his set , he '' occasionally had recourse to
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, whose good nature and extraordinary power of disquisition made him willing and able to knock off an essay on any subject in half an hour . ''

		Even so early , it ap - pears , did Mr.
Lang	PERSON	excite wonder and admir - ation by the fecundity of his genius .

		Upon leaving Oxford Mr.
Liddell	PERSON	gladly followed his father 's advice and treated himself to a year of European travel and social relaxa - tion , during which he saw persons and things well worth writing about .

		It was his father 's desire , also , that led him to devote the best years of his life to an uncongenial profession , while art and literature were beckoning him in their direction .

		Some stolen intervals there were of painting and of writing , some copyings of old masters and some essays in landscape , and
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 also the production of magazine articles and a few seasons of regular work as law reporter for '' The Times . ''

		Walking tours at Whitsuntide in the
Isle of Wight	ORGANIZATION	are pleasantly recalled , and the renewal of old acquaintance with Mrs.
Cam	PERSON	- eron , the artist-photographer , at Freshwater . ''

		On one of these visits she took us to a dance , at Mr.
Tennyson	PERSON	's , at
Farringford	LOCATION	, where I remember seeing the Poet Laureate joining vigorously in the revels .

		He even condescended to ' take the floor ' by dancing in a stately , almost elephantine way , with a young damsel in a polka .

		It was , no doubt , an inter - esting spectacle , to see an Olympian in white kid gloves partaking of the amusements of mankind .

		But I am not sure that I did not regret having gone to that dance , which had much the same effect upon me that the scenes in
Lucian	LOCATION	's ' Dialogues of the Gods ' must have had upon a worshipper of Zeus . ''

		The author 's diaries of this period , and later , furnish him with many noteworthy details con - cerning persons and events .

		A conversation of some length with
George Eliot	PERSON	is reported , and he recalls her '' noble face of the equine type , with fine grey eyes , not large , but deep-set , thoughtful , and kind . ''

		Carlyle also crosses the stage , `` old and shrunken , with a great shock of grey hair and bright eyes , '' but inexhaustible in his fund of '' vivid and pic - turesque stories , which came out one after another , quite silencing Sir
John Coleridge	PERSON	, who had a great reputation as a raconteur . ''

		Gladstone also appears , and more than once , and
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	thus characteristically : ''
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, on being asked why he ate straw - berry jam at breakfast , said that the beneficial effects of happiness upon mankind have been too much under - rated , owing to the over-respect paid to asceticism .

		He considered pleasure an excellent digestive .

		He himself could not digest the same food for many days , simply from the effect that monotony would have upon his mind , and had heard of a man who went into a decline from eating nothing but mutton chops . ''

		Not to be surpassed is the philosopher 's reply to a lady who had expressed a belief that flowers have consciousness . ''

		If you are determined , '' quoth
Spencer	PERSON	, `` to adhere to the proposition that it is possible to dissociate the existence of consciousness from the physiologi - cal processes of nervous organisation , I must differ from you entirely . ''

		The latter part of the book shows us the writer secure in the possession of a not un - congenial office under the friend of his Oxford days ,
Lord Chancellor Reid	PERSON	, and delivered from the '' apprehension of growing old in an unsuccessful life . ''

		He closes his final chapter with this note from his diary , under date of
June 29 , 1906	DATE	: `` Sixty years old to-day . ''

		What manner of man he is in his outward appearance is agreeably shown in a frontispiece , which is a reproduction of Sir
Edward Poynter	PERSON	's portrait of his friend .

		Of the volume as a whole it is well within bounds to say that a more wholesome , straightforward , unpreten - tious , and thoroughly enjoyable piece of work , in the shape of autobiography , has not often been produced .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The warfare on carriers of disease .

		The advance of civilization in the tropics is assured only in so far as the terrible epidemics of disease , which for ages have wiped off the map every ad - vance in certain regions , can be eliminated or con - trolled .

		The most feared of these diseases , because the most mysterious and the most fatal , has been yellow fever .

		Now , thanks to the sacrifices of Doctor
Reid	PERSON	and the investigations of others in the field of preventive medicine , this dread scourge has been robbed of its terrors ; and only ignorance or incompetency or parsimony need expose any tropical community to its devastations .

		Sir
Rupert Boyce	PERSON	, of the
Liverpool School of Tropical Med	ORGANIZATION	- icine , has been a leader in the scientific study of this fever , and in the constructive work of stamping out epidemics in
New Orleans	LOCATION	,
Central America	LOCATION	,
West Indies	LOCATION	,
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	,
Sierra Leone	PERSON	, the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and
Southern Nigeria	LOCATION	, within the last six years .

		In his '' Yellow Fever and its
Preven	PERSON	- tion , a Manual for Medical Students and Practi - tioners '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , he recounts the history of the disease in all tropical lands , treats of its technical pathological and medical aspects , discusses the mos - quito which spreads it abroad , and sets forth in detail the prophylactic measures by means of which communities in civilized and in savage lands have utilized the results of modern science in their de - fence .

		The work is a fine revelation of the coming developments of humanitarian work in the medical profession , and deserves a wide recognition for this reason as well as for its technical value .

		Not only has the mosquito fallen under the ban because of his necessary relation to malaria and yellow fever , but the house-fly also is receiving sweeping condem - nation for his possible relation to typhoid fever .

		Dr.
L. O. Howard	PERSON	, of the
U. S. Bureau of Entomology	ORGANIZATION	, would even go so far as to change the popular name of this insect to '' typhoid fly , '' though he retains the older name in his title , `` The House Fly , Disease Carrier ; an Account of its Dangerous Activities and of the Means of Destroying it '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A storm of protest has been raised by medical men and sanitarians against this proposal , for it tends to mislead the uninformed into the idea that the fly is the only carrier of this disease , as the mosquito is of malaria , and thus to lessen popular precautions regarding milk , water-supply , and sewage .

		Dr. THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	,
Howard	PERSON	's book is replete with the most recent and trustworthy information , and is written in his most lucid and effective style .

		He recounts the life - history of the fly , describes its breeding habits and favorite haunts , and tells of its parasites and enemies ; he gives in detail the best methods of ridding the house of these pests , of preventing their multiplication on the farm and in the city , and supplies the information needed to enable a community to deal effectively with the problem of their extermination .

		Health officers , teachers , edi - tors , and all interested in the public campaign against this menace to the comfort and safety of the home and the community , will find here an arsenal of the latest and most effective ammunition for their righteous warfare .

		Human ^ ense The volume called Clever Hans '' and horse-sense -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is the tale of a horse so far in cooperation .

		^ outer adornment goes , but the story of the pitfalls of ordinary human reasoning so far as pointing a moral .

		The echoes of the remarkable excitement created in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1904	DATE	by the intellectual performances of ''
Kluge Hans	PERSON	, '' the horse of
Herr von Osten	PERSON	, lost much of their power to carry conviction when transmitted across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Not so the translation of the very painstaking and ingenious investigation , duly set forth by Dr.
Oscar Pfungst	PERSON	, of the psychological department of
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems a little out of place to say that the result was a complete exposure of the horse the usual demon - stration with reference to claimants for unusual and psychology-defying psychic powers , that they were clever but not supernatural , and not what they purported to be .

		Also like psychic claimants , the claim of the super-gift proved too much ; it not only overreached itself and in attempting the sublime slipped to the ridiculous , but failed lament - ably and suspiciously to account for its own limita - tions .

		Hans calculated in grades and systems from kindergarten to high school counted , distin - guished , grouped , classified , judged , corrected his errors , and in brief answered any sort of question that could be indicated by any reasonable number of pawings with his forefoot .

		The exhibitions were not conducted for gain ; the sponsors for the genuineness of the phenomena were many and distinguished ;
Herr von Osten	PERSON	was honest ; there were no signs or signals that anyone could detect , certainly none arranged ; and staid
Berlin	LOCATION	was excited , psychology refuted ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	on trial .

		It all sounds so simple , with the simplicity of the Columbian egg , when you have the clue ; but such situations are baffling and blind until the general presumption is made a specific demonstra - tion .

		Quite naturally , quite unconsciously , signals were given .

		If interested and of the motor-emotional type , one 's body bends forward as the tapping begins and straightens up when the correct count is reached .

		The horse 's eye is shrewd enough to notice this , and so stops correctly , irrespective of whether the question is as to the product of two by four less one , or how many days in the week , or wonders in the world .

		So long as the master knows the answer and
Hans	PERSON	can see his master , knowledge holds on and wisdom is ascribed ; but ask the simplest query of which the master knows not the answer , or subject
Hans	PERSON	to large blinders , and in pardon - able slang there is nothing doing .

		The details of the story and the corroborations of the clues are worked out with remarkable nicety and with all the armament of the psychological laboratory .

		The human subject takes the role of
Hans	PERSON	, another that of the master , a third that of the investigator ; and the '' graphic '' records record the plot and its ex - posure .

		But what a blow is all this for the vaunted horse-sense of the average man !

		The psychologist seems to be coming to his own ; and the guesses of interested laymen no longer impose .

		Colonel Roosevelt The m * ual admiration of Colonel as seen through
Roosevelt	PERSON	and
Kaiser Wilhelm	PERSON	is German glasses .

		weU k nown ?

		as a l so tne fact that our distinguished ex-President has many other admirers in the German Empire .

		One of these , Dr.
Max Kullnick	PERSON	, has prepared for his fellow - countrymen an appreciative biography of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, which has been translated into English by Professor
Frederick von Reithdorf	PERSON	of
Monmouth College	ORGANIZATION	, and is published under the title `` From Rough Rider to President '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		There is now no lack of material , both in Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's own writings and in what has been written about him by others , from which to construct a fairly authoritative account of his strenuous life .

		In addition to these printed sources , Dr.
Kullnick	PERSON	has had the help of Mr.
William Loeb , Jr.	PERSON	, formerly private-secretary to President
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and he gives many details , especially concerning the early life of the subject of his book , which are either new or little known to the reading public .

		That short season in Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's childhood that was passed in
Germany	LOCATION	, his present biographer is well-fitted to treat in such a way as to throw new light on the character and aptitudes of the boy Theodore .

		Passing to the four years at
Harvard	LOCATION	, the author takes occasion to contrast American and German university methods , to the advantage of the former as he conceives it .

		`` The German university , '' he says , '' is satisfied if it crams into the minds of the young men the greatest amount possible of the dry bones of human wisdom ; but the American univer - sity is not content till it has entered the inner sanctum of the student 's soul , dictated his ideals and moulded his character . ''

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's share in the Spanish - American War is related in sufficient detail .

		In the disputed question of the Rough Riders ' charge at
San Juan	LOCATION	, the author appears to be correctly informed , and makes them charge up Kettle Hill , as is told at length by their commander in his book , '' The Rough Riders '' ; but on a later page Dr.
Kullnick	PERSON	refers the action to
San Juan Hill	LOCATION	.

		However , it is unnecessary to quibble over
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 names , especially as that of `` Kettle Hill '' came into being only after the battle in its neighborhood .

		The author speaks of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's conscientious work on the
Civil Service Commission	ORGANIZATION	'' through the two years of
Harrison	PERSON	's administration and the four of
Grover Cleveland	LOCATION	's , '' which not only con - veys a wrong impression as to the length of Har - rison 's presidency , but is inaccurate concerning the duration of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's commissionership , which began in
1889	DATE	and ended in
1895	DATE	.

		Here and there occur a few more or less amusing reminders that the author , and his translator also , are of foreign birth ; or at least , our idioms are less familiar to them than they might be . ''

		The cowardly method of rakes '' is apparently a hit at the muck-rakers .

		The word '' bride '' is used in the German sense , where we resort to the French fiancee ; and '' the pirate ship , the
Alabama	LOCATION	'' is a little misleading . ''

		The
London	LOCATION	Alps Club '' evidently refers to the
Alpine Club	ORGANIZATION	rendered familiar to us by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, and others .

		The book as a whole is excellent reading , especially for boys , to whom the courageous and manly qualities of our ex-President are made to appeal with force .

		The best side of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	could not well have been portrayed more effectively .

		The biography ends with his election to the presidency in
1904	DATE	.

		The book has as frontispiece the familiar picture of the fence-vaulting horseman .

		A not unworthy One ``

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is composed of letters from a successful
London	LOCATION	G.P. -LRB- he himself re - peatedly uses this abbreviation for '' general practi - tioner '' -RRB- to a small circle of relatives and friends .

		Perhaps never since the '' Autocrat '' delighted the early ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' readers has more of shrewd and humorous and thoroughly enjoyable observation been packed into a physician 's non-professional utterances .

		A slender thread of romance serves for the stringing together of these miscellaneous bits of wit and wisdom , but not even that is in the least necessary to hold the reader 's attention and lure him on to the end of the sage observer 's remarks on men and things .

		Incidentally he arrives at the happy though unexpected termination of Miss
Molly Harding	PERSON	's love affair .

		Here is a random and not unseasonable passage from the fourth letter : '' Is it racial , or universal , or temperamental , I wonder , this passionate yearning to be elsewhere some uncrush - able remnant of Romance ?

		I give it up .

		I am sure that it is a nuisance ; and equally certain that it is in reality the very salt of life . ''

		In a letter supposed to have been written at the close of an illness during which much reading of current litera - ture beguiled the hours of confinement , there is some excellent and generously appreciative criticism of contemporary authors .

		Another letter describes at length , with pertinent reflections interspersed , a pil - grimage of devout and pathetically hopeful patients to
Lourdes	LOCATION	.

		Whoever the author of the book may be , we can hardly be mistaken in judging him to be a practising physician of long and varied experience , and a man given both to thought and to its well - considered expression .

		If he is not a physician , he has certainly done some hard reading in medicine .

		Getting nervous The several adjectives harnessed to through fear of the patient and abused beast of bur nervousness .

		ab -LRB- mt ag commonly suggest a binding restriction and an added mechanical aid to the pull or push of effort .

		One is sometimes in doubt whether the life strenu - ous , simple , happy , balanced , efficient , progressive , social , individual , presents a problem or an ideal .

		Advice abounds ; panaceas , elixirs , formulae , may be had for the asking , or at any price one chooses to pay .

		America seems to be the land of the free prescription and the home of the brave takers thereof .

		It is also the culture-ground of nervous - ness .

		Dr.
Partridge	PERSON	, who is a psychological and not a medical adviser , has produced a useful volume on '' The Nervous Life '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The shoe will be found to fit many a restless foot .

		It is a sane manual , at once on the side of modera - tion in principle and simplicity of practice .

		It points out a sound and safe middle-path between fads and neglect , between blissful ignorance and overweening knowledge .

		It makes right-feeling r right - doing and right-knowing each properly valued and attainable according to one 's light .

		The social complexity of modern conditions , and the strain that is the temptation from which we pray and seek deliverance , are duly recognised as inevitable .

		The strength to meet them by the wise ordering of our mental attitudes and our bodily habits is exalted above the fleetness or ingenuity exhibited in escap - ing from them .

		The work is well conceived and simply written .

		To the many who have become nervous concerning the nervousness of their lives , it should bring a wholesome sedative influence .

Maurel	PERSON	's '' Little Cities of Italian travels , _ , , - IITTI / - ^ artistic and
Italy	LOCATION	, translated by
Helen Gerard	PERSON	sociological .

		an -LRB- j published by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , takes its readers on what the author terms '' an artistic and sociological journey '' through two groups of historically significant Italian municipal ities :
Florence	LOCATION	, with her Tuscan girdle of
San Gimignano	LOCATION	,
Monte Oliveto	ORGANIZATION	,
Pisa	LOCATION	,
Lucca	LOCATION	,
Prato	LOCATION	,
Pistoia	LOCATION	and
Arezzo	LOCATION	; and the scattered principal cities of the
Veneto Lecco	LOCATION	,
Bergamo	LOCATION	,
Brescia	LOCATION	,
Verona	LOCATION	,
Vicenza	LOCATION	,
Padua	LOCATION	,
Mantua	LOCATION	, and
Arqua	LOCATION	.

		Dante ,
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, and
Petrarch	PERSON	are the ever-welcome figures which rise oftenest .

		Some of the content of the book is fresh and original , but more of it is already familiar to those who have some acquaint - ance with Italian history and art , for whom the book is intended .

		Among the most stimulating parts is the concluding chapter , in which the author voices his regret that the sacrifice of French blood 22 -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, in the risorgimento has been fruitless of the real freedom which the individual parts of
Italy	LOCATION	have through all time heen seeking .

		He sees in the still fluctuating Italo-German-Papal political relations only a modern continuation of the historic policy of the Italian to assure himself of liberty , now by means of Guelf support , now of
Ghibelline	LOCATION	; a policy which has always brought a measure of independ - ence , but never true liberty .


M. Maurel	PERSON	's work , which the publishers have made into a beautiful volume , is characterized by a pleasing delicacy of style , and by touches of sentiment which are only once in a while a little too pronounced virtues which no doubt lent still greater charm to the original French , and help account for the fact that the work was crowned by the French Academy .

W. H. Koebel	PERSON	's ``
Argentina	LOCATION	, Past and Present '' -LRB-
Dodd Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an account of the youngest , strongest , and most '' up-to-date '' of the South American republics .

		The author has travelled over much of the country , has consulted the Argentine leaders in finance , agriculture , and politics , and has already published a book on '' Modern
Argentina	LOCATION	. ''

		His slender historical summaries are of value chiefly as a setting for the more detailed descriptions of the social and economic institutions of the country .

		Since
Argentina	LOCATION	is still mainly an agricultural and grazing country , the author properly devotes much space to the conditions under which farming and cattle-raising are carried on .

		He also discusses the labor situation , immigration , railway development , social classes , and amusements .

		The North American will be surprised at the descriptions of the Argentine cities most of which are evidently fully abreast of , and in some things superior to , our cities of the same size .

		The illustrations in the volume are numerous and good .

		Not much can be said in com - mendation of the author 's style .

		The early chapters are crabbedly written , and there is throughout an irritating use of two words , '' ere '' and '' ethics , '' the latter always in a most unusual sense .


Mary Austin	PERSON	's drama `` The Arrow and aSboo * .

		Maker / ' as seen at The New Theatre at the tail-end of its last season , is a worthy attempt to deal with a picturesque and interesting native theme , rather than a successful play for stage purposes .

		The
New York	LOCATION	critics conceded its pictorial value , its beautiful setting , and the fine opportunity it offered Miss
Wynne	PERSON	- Matthison an opportunity firmly grasped by that capable player .

		But a reading of the play as it now appears in book form -LRB-
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- plainly reveals that while excellent material is to be found in it , the handling is not such as to give the progres - sion , clash , and tense moments of climax , necessary to make a true drama .

		The central idea of a hand - some young `` medicine woman '' assisting a young chief by her prophecies because he has secretly won her love , the situation created by his repudiation of that love when he marries a chief 's daughter , and the way Chisera gets her revenge , are full of dramatic possibilities .

		Perhaps the technical rea - son why the clinch is not quite there , is that the spectator 's interest is divided between the fate of these lovers and that of the tribe of which they are members ; this ethnic motive at the end is the strongest , so that there is a shifting of the emphasis .

		In sympathetic accuracy of depiction , the play merits praise ; the writer knows her subject-matter , and has given a faithful picture in place of the cheap caricatures so often substituted for the truth .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
C. Ainsworth Mitchell	PERSON	's '' Science and the Criminal '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains a popular account of the methods pursued by the intellects of science in their battle with the wits of sharpers .

		It covers a wide field , from the disclosures which keen analysis may make in handwriting , blood-stains , finger - prints , and chemical findings , to the varied applications of logic in circumstantial evidence , in proofs of alibi , in converting the trivial into the momentous .

		While the volume appeals to the sporting instincts for which the hunting of the criminal is a game of adventure , it also makes an interesting story of the ways of knowledge as a source of power , - in this instance , of the power to bring to light what the spirits of darkness shrewdly conceal .

		There was published at
Erlangen	LOCATION	, in
1788	DATE	, a two - volume work by

		It is the work of a trained scientific observer , who had come to
America	LOCATION	in
1777	DATE	as chief surgeon to the
Ansbach	LOCATION	'' Hessians , '' who remained in the country for seven years , and wrote several special works about the natural history of the colonies .

		After the war had come to end , he made the extensive journey described in the work now before us .

Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's intimate personal friends in his earlier years , and was taken by him to

		It was not long ago that we had occasion to commend its excellent illustrated pamphlet tracing the early history of the settlement that after - ward became known as
Jersey City	LOCATION	.

		And now , in celebration of Flag Day -LRB-
June 14	DATE	-RRB- , it has issued an eight-page treatise on '' The American Flag , '' packed with information on the subject of flags in general and our own flag in particular .

		The little work is of anonymous authorship , but we are informed that it is from the pen of the assistant librarian , who has evidently had no lack of material to draw upon in the library of '' the city .

		No list of authorities is appended , but a footnote informs the reader of '' a large and valuable collection of books and magazine articles '' in the library , and available for reference or for home reading .

		Not long ago , the Rev.
Joseph H. Crooker	PERSON	pub - lished his volume on '' The Church of
Today	DATE	. ''

		He has now given us a companion volume entitled '' The Church of Tomorrow '' -LRB- Pilgrim Press -RRB- .

		The books were written by one who is an ardent disciple of Christianity , but who has in no way identified himself with any dogma , ritual , or ecclesiastical organization .

		Both volumes were drawn out by the controversy which is waged by the science and philosophy of our time , with the several expositions of faith , as not resting on a broad and universal basis .

		The author accepts these grounds of criticism , and gives a view of the church , present and to come , which reposes its claims broadly on all human knowlege .

		The first book was remarkable for the justness and enthusiasm of its state - ments , and yet for their soundness and sufficiency .

		The second book shares these qualities , though one may feel that , dealing with a topic more conjectural , the style is not as simple and impressive as in the former work .

		The Grain of Dust , '' published a few months ago , is by no means the last book which we are to have from the pen of the late
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	.

		The Messrs.

Richard Wagner	PERSON	. ''

		The translation has been done by Mr.

		There are one or two selections for each of a long list of feminine names , arranged in alphabeti - cal order .

		THE JUDGMENT OF gorfe ftttiug ILttetarg Bebiefo ON
Beecham	PERSON	's
GETTYSBURG	LOCATION	-LRB- From issue
June 4 , 1911	DATE	. -RRB-

		GETTYSBURG AGAIN Capt.
Beecham	PERSON	's Capital Description of the Battle in Untechnical Terms THE battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	was undoubtedly a pivotal , and it can scarcely be disputed that it was the decisive battle of the Civil War .

		It has been described in history and in ro - mance ; it has been argued about inimitably ; yet we do not recall in any other book so clear and easily comprehensible a description of the events of those three days of tremendous fighting as Capt.
B. K. Beecham	PERSON	gives in his ''
Gettys	PERSON	- burg '' -LRB- McClurg ,
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The order of engage - ments and their relative bearing are admirably set forth ... There is nothing quite so hard to follow as military manoeuvres . ''

		For every battle of the warrior , '' as Scripture says '' is with con - fused noise and garments rolled in blood '' ; and most of the descriptions are likewise .

		Not so Capt.
Beecham	PERSON	's account .

		He has a con - cise , lucid style , and his presentation abounds with quaint anecdotes and comments shrewd and naive .

		One may not quite agree with his criticisms upon the strategy and especially the tactics , of the various commanders .

		Lee might be apportioned a little less blame , and
Meade	PERSON	accorded a little more praise ; and yet , in the main , what Capt.
Beecham	PERSON	says about
Lee	PERSON	's singular tactics and
Meade	PERSON	's lack of initiative is largely justified .

		In the battle of
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	the tran - scendent genius of Lee and of
Jackson	PERSON	was at its full flood .

		For at least a part of that campaign , Hooker proved no unworthy antag - onist for the other two .

		Contrasted with that marvelous campaign the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	was a rather blundering , pitiable sort of con - test , full of bloody and most desperate fight - ing , but not illuminated by that fine intellectual play of gigantic war fencing , which makes
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, though less important , much more memorable .

		If
Lee	PERSON	had had
Jackson	PERSON	at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, the fight would not have been prolonged for three daya , and
Meade	PERSON	would probably have been beaten .

		Certainly
Pickett	PERSON	's spectacular but utterly futile and wasteful charge would not have been attempted ... Capt.
Beecham	PERSON	's book is a delight .

		Everyone who visits the famous field ought first to possess himself of this volume and master its contents .

		Being non-technical , a layman unfamiliar with the art of war can understand it , if he will .

		The portraits are quaint and interesting .

		With many illustrations and map .

		56 THACKERAY .

		It is nearly forty-eight years since
Thackeray	PERSON	died ; for this is the centenary year of his birth , and he lived only to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's age .

		We set no other Englishman at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's side , but of those whom we perforce rank below him there are perhaps not more than a dozen who have as large a share as Thackeray in our af - fection and admiration .

		In the matter of per - sonality , he is far more to us than the great Elizabethan ; for the latter is a shadowy figure whose character is to us almost wholly inferen - tial built up in imagination from those traits of tenderness and sympathy which must have existed in the creator of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's world of men and women .

		But
Thackeray	PERSON	is ours in a far more definite and intimate sense ; we know him in his habit as he lived , in the way of familiar intercourse , and in the manifold revelations that we owe to the members of his family and social circle .

		And thus knowing him we wonder at the richness of his mind and the iridescent quality of its expression , at the warmth of his heart and the degree in which it endeared him to his fellow men .

		Vainly he sought , by his injunction that he should not be made the subject of a biography , to give finality to his exit from the world of men ; posterity has not consented to have it thus , and has clung determinedly to his memory , using every available means to keep it from oblivion , and displaying a possibly over-zealous purpose to preserve every scrap of his writing , every line of his pencil , and every incident of his daily life .

		Affection is not often accompanied by critical discrimination , but it is at least '' a good fault '' which has led to this raking up of reminiscence and this ransacking of the literary waste-paper basket .

		We have had countless novelists since
Thackeray	PERSON	; we have new ones every year , and acclaim the better of them in terms that will be amusing to recall when we shall have got the new-comers into some sort of perspective .

		We sometimes take such delight in a new trick of style , or a new angle of observation , or an ingenious new form of construction , that we fondly imagine the past surpassed , and from the vantage-point of our more refined modern art aver , as in one noteworthy instance , that
Thack	PERSON	- 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, eray 's '' confidential attitude '' would in a mod - ern novelist be found as insufferable as
Richard	PERSON	- son 's prolixity or Fielding 's coarseness .

		But presently we forget the paragon of literary ex - cellence who has persuaded us to so unguarded an outburst , and discern again in our Thackeray a combination of virtues that makes the best of our new discoveries seem the merest creatures of a day in the comparison .

		We have only to re-open the long-closed pages , and their spell is again upon us , making us wonder at our own forgetfulness , and at our readiness to mistake pinchbeck , or even an alloy of low grade , for the precious metal .

		There are faults in
Thack	LOCATION	- eray , no doubt , and things that some later writers have learned to do better than he could do them ; but what can these matter in the light of the wealth which he offers us with so lavish a hand ?

		The sun may have spots , but we should be ill-advised to worship in its stead any pale though spotless luminary , without the vivifying warmth that is the gift of the orb of day .

		The Victorian period of English literature , especially that earlier part of it of which self - satisfaction and smug respectability were the salient characteristics , has now receded so far into the distant past that we may fully realize its contracted vision and its intellectual limita - tions .

		Criticism has dealt with it somewhat severely , and been disposed to emphasize its defects at the expense of its merits .

		It was a stagnant period , and its deadening influence was felt in all its phases of artistic expression .

		Yet it was a period that produced many out - standing literary personalities , whose voices could not be altogether smothered , but persis - tently cried out in the wilderness of common - place existence and comfortable philistinism .

		The products of that age which survive do so by virtue of the accent of protest and prophesy rather than of the accent of acquiescence .

		Thackeray survives splendidly in his style and his deep humanity . ''

		In what other novelist , '' says Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in his invocation of
Thackeray	PERSON	's shade , '' since
Scott	PERSON	was worn down by the burden of a forlorn endeavor , and died for honor 's sake , has the world found so many of the fairest gifts combined ?

		If we may not call you a poet , who that was less than a poet ever saw life with a glance so keen as yours , so steady , and so sane ?

		Your pathos was never cheap , your laughter never forced ; your sigh was never the pulpit trick of the preacher . ''

		Living in a society based in large measure upon shams and hypocrisies ,
Thackeray	PERSON	natur - ally incurred the charge of cynicism merely be - cause he pictured the life about him with incisive truth .

		It was a foolish charge , and has been refuted a thousand times .

		Could any - one suppose that it delighted him to see men and women actuated by mean motives , or imagine that his zest in analyzing various forms of base - ness was the index of anything but contempt and indignation on his part ?

		But his business as a novelist was to depict life as he found it in his own milieu ; it was by thus holding the mirror up to his own time that he appeared to the clear-souled
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	as '' the first social regenerator of the day , '' and is revealed in such guise to all who look beneath the surface of his writings , and supplement their knowledge of the books by acquaintance with the man .

		Thackeray 's account has now been long - enough closed , and searchingly enough audited , to enable us to know pretty closely how it stands .

		As a stylist , he has few equals in our literature . ''

		Nobody in our day wrote with such perfection of style , '' was
Carlyle	PERSON	's verdict ; and
Lowell	PERSON	spoke of the style as '' beyond praise so easy , so limpid , showing everywhere by unobtrusive allusions how rich he was in modern culture . ''

		As a novelist , he was the greatest of his time and that the flowering time of British fiction with probably only Fielding and
Scott	PERSON	for his peers in the whole range of our literature .

		As a satirical com - mentator upon humanity , he was one of the most penetrating spirits that ever lived , but with the temper of
Horace	PERSON	and Montaigne rather than with that of Juvenal and Swift . ''

		Love is a higher intellectual exercise than hatred , '' he once wrote to a friend .

		As a man , he was about as finely moulded in character as humankind is ever permitted to be , lovable as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
Stevenson	PERSON	were lovable , and a very few others of the writing kind .

		And when he went to '' God 's next world '' an American poet ,
Richard Henry Stoddard	PERSON	, was moved to write for him this epitaph : '' Where grand old Homer sits In godlike state benign ; Where broods in endless thought The awful Florentine ; Where sweet
Cervantes	PERSON	walks , A smile on his grave face ; Where gossips quaint Montaigne , The wisest of the race ; Where Goethe looks through all With that calm eye of his ; Where little seen but light The only
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is ; There this new spirit came .

		They asked him , drawing near , ' Art thou become like us ? '

		He answered , ' I am here . ' ''

		THE DIAL 33 A STUDY IN PROPORTION .

		On a hill a little remote from but still overlooking the town of
Stratford	LOCATION	in
England	LOCATION	there is a granite shaft , nearly a hundred feet high , which dominates the neighborhood .

		The history of its erection is as follows : A young man of
Stratford	LOCATION	, in the manner of his predecessor
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, went up to
London	LOCATION	, but instead of going into poetry devoted himself to the manufacture of that other intoxicant , beer .

		Accumulating a fortune , he returned to his native town , and , possibly fearing that posterity might not realize his superiority to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, built himself this monument .

		It seems to me that it is a symbol of what is hap - pening all over the world to-day .

		Shakespeare is accepted as the standard of human greatness , and people are everywhere putting up memorials to themselves , or to those they admire , to equal or over - top his .

		In criticism , biography , current talk , there is a continual shriek arising that '' I , thou , he or she is as great as Shakespeare . ''

		Is there any modern writer of importance who has not been compared with , preferred to , or at least judged only a shade less potent than , the master-poet ?

		Even the votaries of practical life have been drawn into the vortex of Shakespearian comparison .

		A pedestal for Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	, of course , but how in the world does oil come into competition with poetry ?

		It is im - mensely flattering to Shakespeare that he is selected to keep the list against all comers ; but a better sense of values and proportion would discharge him from his perpetual vigil .

		A champion of the Ring is not expected to meet a new aspirant for the belt until the latter has overcome all other aspirants .

		Literary criticism has not yet decided who is the greatest writer of the
last century	DATE	.

		Byron , Hugo ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, and a score or so of others , are in the running .

		Each of these has his crowd of followers who cry his name to the skies .

		In the sober judgment of the world , only one modern has drawn himself out of the ruck and got into the class with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		And Goethe as he saw and said himself has little of the power of his predecessor .

		Near things loom large , and new things are usually bright .

		Criticism is largely a matter of nerves ; appreciation depends on subjective feeling .

		What is novel strikes us with more force than what we have long known .

		And there is a meas - ure of truth in
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's fine saying that all masterpieces are equal .

		Anyone who has done perfectly a piece of work , however small , which is of constant appeal , is free of the domain of letters .

		But writers differ in intensity , variety , velocity , mass .

		There are many elements which must be calculated before we can assign them their respec - tive importance .

		Just to lift one corner of the cloud-curtain of that supreme and starry world of Shakespeare which impends over modern literature , I should like to make a little study of the type of female char - acter which he has made peculiarly his own the brilliant , intellectual , fearless girl , who is really '' a pure anticipated cognition '' of our most recent feminine ideals .

		Where did he get his conception ?

		Of course , history is strewn over with women of force and intellect , from
Hypatia	LOCATION	to
Joan	PERSON	of ` Arc ; and many others emerged from mythology and poetry the Greek and Scandinavian goddesses and heroines , the
Clorinda of Tasso	PERSON	, the Britomart of Spenser .

		These are satisfactory enough in action , but it was reserved for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to make them speak .

		Retaining the nobility of char - acter belonging to the scattered historic or mythical women , he gave them the glittering rapier of the tongue , by which they could more than hold their own against their opposites or enemies , the men .

		There are many studies of this wise-virgin type in
Shakespeare Beatrice	LOCATION	,
Portia	LOCATION	,
Isabella	LOCATION	; but his best all-around girl is
Rosalind	PERSON	.

		Fearless , witty , true hearted , and brilliant , she is his most dazzling if not deepest female creation .

		For cen - turies she has been the favorite of the English speaking stage .

		As Hamlet is said to be actor - proof , so Rosalind plays herself .

		Many actresses have interpreted her supremely well ; but , given only the most modest equipment , it would be difficult for any young woman to fail entirely in presenting the part .

		For one thing ,
Rosalind domi	PERSON	- nates her play as completely as Hamlet does his .

		She is the central fire which lights up all the other pensive and rather shadowy characters .

		Even in her eclipse at court , the reigning
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's daughter is only a foil to her , and she goes into exile like a torch carried through the woods .

		Probably the very best kind of a young woman has a touch of boy in her .

		Something more of
Rosalind	PERSON	than her attire is virile .

		She seeks adventures like a Paladin ; and though she faints when her affections receive a shock , we feel that she would meet real danger with heroism .

		But of course her supreme gift is that of brilliant speech .

		It runs through all the gamut of which wit is capable gayety , mock - ery , irony , badinage , humor , sarcasm .

		Yet it is never less than womanly , ladylike .

		She is the bril - liant forerunner of the Bachelor Girl of to-day the bright exemplar whom most women would like to resemble .

		Let us see if any subsequent literary creator has made her match .

		The intellectual heroine , once invented , had more or less to conquer the world ; and accordingly we find
Moliere	PERSON	much concerned with her .

		In several of his comedies , he merely satirizes her ; but at length he feels her fascination , and begins to realize her , after the French type , in '' The Misanthrope . ''

		Cdlimene is a thinner and harder creation than
Rosalind	PERSON	.

		All romance is left out of her .

		She flies the woods and desert wastes , as
Rosalind	PERSON	hies to them .

		She is of the city and society .

		Her speech has none of the rich natural joy of
Rosalind 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is calculated polished to a cutting edge .

		And in spite of its high breeding the air of the grand dame which
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	contrives THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, to stamp upon it it has something of a hint of the repartee of the fish-market .

		Yet Ce ` limene has at least the suspicion of a heart .

		Though she pre - fers to torment , she might possibly be induced to love .

		As it is , she is perhaps the most fascinating young woman in French comedy ; only , she is not central in her play , as
Rosalind	PERSON	is in hers .

		At most , she is a siren of the surf whose white arms wreathe round or beckon afar to the dark abrupt rock of Alceste .

		Congreve 's Millamant is
Rosalind	PERSON	's nearest rival in literature .

		She is the artifice of artificiality .

		She lives and breathes in the atmosphere of Pope 's '' Rape of the Lock . ''

		But in her own sphere she is as rich a creation as her Shakespearian sister .

		She is more mature .

		She is all woman .

		There is certainly no shadow of the doublet and hose in her disposition .

		She has vapors and languors and in - effable airs .

		She demands admiration as a right .

		She lives on a diet of the hearts of men .

		Like a divinity , she would starve if the smoke of incense were shut off from her .

		Yet she is utterly without ill-nature , and we feel that at bottom she is as loving as she is lovable .

		In speech at least , she is fully the equal of
Rosalind	PERSON	or Ce ` limene .

		Perhaps more than is the case with either of these , her words are impregnated with her personality .

		We hear the tones of her voice in them , see her smile and gesture .

		English speech has never fallen in more faultless cadences than from her tongue .

		But after all , though she has nothing in her of the minx that Ce ` limene displays , she is only a poor rela - tion of Rosalind in point of character .

		Lady
Teazle	PERSON	is the daughter of Ce ` limene mer - rier , shallower , more rowdyish .

		She picks up the rapier of wit and dashes into the great scandal scene with immense animation ; but she does not dominate and direct her coterie as Ce ` limene does .

		And in that most effective of all comedy situations , the screen scene , her sword drops from her hand and she is dumb .

		She is a slight personage indeed compared with the rich full-blooded girls of Shake - speare or Congveve .

		So much for the dramatists in their best embodi - ments of this type .

		The novelists , of course , have taken it up ; but it may be said at once that their success is in inverse ratio to the mass of their efforts .

		The twenty thousand words of a play may generally be depended upon to produce a more distinct creation than the one hundred and fifty thousand of a novel .

		Scott 's Di Vernon is perhaps the first satisfactory instance of the type in novel literature .

		She is a girl of gold .

		She is as high - spirited and fearless as
Rosalind	PERSON	, and is engaged in scenes almost as romantic .

		She protects the man she loves , and fences with and foils her treacherous cousin .

		But though
Scott	PERSON	allows her to be un - conventional in action , he hardly permits her to rise out of conventionality in speech .

		Indeed , though he could be terse and vivid enough in speeches of passion or eccentric character , his dialogue does not often shine or glow with wit .

		Wit there is in plenty in the pages of
Jane Austen	PERSON	; but it is a delicate wit , a miniature wit hardly that nurtured by high natural spirits or polished in the strife of the world .


Elizabeth Bennet	PERSON	is the prose
Rosalind	PERSON	of an English country - side .

		She is quite adequate to her occasions and surroundings ; perfectly able to take care of herself where nothing is likely to happen to her , and ca - pable of conquering where there are no antagonists worthy of her steel .

		She is as brilliant as quiet good taste will permit her to be .

		Tamed
Rosalind	PERSON	as she is , we all love her and think
Darcy	PERSON	's man - sion and park her fitting reward .

		George Sand preached the evangel of woman 's rights , and illustrated it to the extreme in her own life .

		It is natural , therefore , that we should look to her for some brilliant exemplar of the woman of intellect .

		It is pretty hard to find one in her works .

		The Indianas and Consuelos revolt , but they revenge themselves on man by physical rather than intellectual means .

		Edme `` e in '' Mauprat '' is per - haps her most brilliant heroine .

		She fights the duel of sex with sweetness , constancy , and valor .

		But
George Sand	PERSON	's languorous and multitudinous prose is hardly calculated to receive the stamp of wit - coinage .

		We may dismiss even Edme'e as only an acolyte in the temple of female intellect .


George Meredith	PERSON	was interested all his life in the question of woman 's intellectual equality with man .

		He believed in it and fought for it ; and when he made his greatest effort to exemplify it he seems to have persuaded himself that he had won his cause and achieved a masterpiece .

		And , verily , by his enthusiasm he almost persuades his readers also .

		Before
Diana	PERSON	of the Crossways he prostrates himself with
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	obeisance .

		He serves her as a lover and a slave .

		He thinks no evil of her himself , nor will he permit anyone else to do so .

		Probably no author ever exhibited his adoration of a character to such an extent .

		Yet when the reader can free himself from
Meredith	PERSON	's special pleading , things do not seem to be as he states them .

		Diana does about everything that she ought not to do .

		Endowed with a small property and many friends , she yet permits herself to con - tract a loveless marriage with the first well-to-do man who offers himself .

		From him she runs away , and only is saved from scandal rather mysteri - ously by the intervention of a former lover .

		Then she becomes a Blue-stocking , writes '' bril - liant '' novels , and sets up a rather emancipated salon in
London	LOCATION	.

		She flirts with an aged prime minister , and falls in love with his rising nephew ; and she betrays him with inexplicable Judas treachery for '' a sum of money .

		Perhaps this is all right perhaps a woman is permitted to do these things ; but what we are most concerned with is
Diana	LOCATION	's succession to the throne of wit and intel - lect founded by
Rosalind	PERSON	.

		Meredith assures us that this is so .

		He has even less patience with readers who doubt her wit than with those who hesitate at her character .

		Now while there may
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL be no question at all that the novelist himself had a great inheritance of wit , he seems absolutely unable to estate his cherished heroine with any of it .

		As long as he keeps on describing her , lighting her up with his own verbal torches , we fancy that she does really dim the glories of Ce * limene or Millamant .

		But the moment she opens her mouth she is betrayed .

		Compared with them , she can hardly say '' Bo '' to a goose .

		It is certainly singular , that back in the dark ages when women 's intellectual equality with man was hardly suspected ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	should have projected the most brilliant female figure in fiction ; while recently , in the very van of the feminist movement , and in the tendance of an intense be - liever in that creed , the clear bright flame of the
Rosalind	PERSON	type should sputter out in the dismal failure of
Diana	LOCATION	.

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A CORONATION WITHOUT A CORONATION - ODE strikes one , if one happens to think of it , as wanting in completeness .

		What is a poet laureate for , if not to tune his lyre on such occasions ?

		Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, in his just-published Autobiography , says in reference to
Queen Victoria	LOCATION	's Diamond Jubilee : `` Though , as I have already pointed out , it is rec - ognized that no obligation is imposed on the Poet Laureate to write tm any event or occasion , I could not help feeling that for such a celebration a Poem by him would be looked for .

		The whole nation was in a state of pleasurable enthusiasm , and there - fore in the best and most amiable of moods . ''

		Ac - cordingly , as many will remember , a set of verses was produced which enjoyed a considerable news - paper publicity .

		One of our leading journals re - marks that on this later occasion '' the King appears to have forgotten to order the odist to ode , '' whereas it was the royal odist 's part to take the initiative if he felt moved to raise a paean of joy .

		But the coronation was not uncelebrated in verse .

		An unlaureate
Austin	LOCATION	, surnamed
Dobson	PERSON	, seems to have stepped in at the last moment to supply the omission in a poem which suggests rather pointedly a comparison between the products of the unofficial and official bard . ''

		Not with high-vaulting phrase , or rush Of weak-winged epithets that tire With their own weight , or formal gush , We greet Thee , Sire ! ''

		And another Alfred Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	helps us to bear the loss of the `` formal gush '' of an official ode , by contributing a poem whose closing lines will meet a hearty response on this side of the '' three thousand miles of sea '' which separate
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	: '' They sundered .

		But how mightily they meet .

		Hark !

		O'er three thousand miles of sea they greet The first gleam of the nobler years to be .

		They stand together in the morning light , Here , in the vanguard of humanity , Shaking the heart of Chaos and Old Night With one harmonious Word Peace and Good-will . ''

		CORONATION HONORS TO ENGLISH MEN OF LET - TERS were but meagrely bestowed , perhaps because the list of other classes of prospective recipients had attained so formidable a length before the poor scribblers were reached .

		But Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, of '' National Biography '' fame and a contributor to our knowledge of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, was knighted ; he well deserved the distinction , as did also , for equally good reasons , Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, who is now Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, which has a fine as well as a familiar sound .

		Why , however , should these honors to writers have been restricted to scholars ?

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, who has certainly deserved well of his country , still lives , untitled though not un - honored ; and the name of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	will occur to many as among the more gifted writers of his time .

		Is Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	also to live out his life as a commoner ?

		While honors are going , these and other names of `` creative '' authors naturally occur to one .

		But let us hope these men of genius regard with a becoming indifference '' rank , title , and all the solemn plausibilities of the world . ''

		AN EXHIBITION OF TnACKERAYANA , in commem - oration of the hundredth recurrence of the great novelist 's birthday , is now the leading attraction afc the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the Fine Arts Room have been placed on view not only the library 's treasures in rare
Thackeray	PERSON	editions and other objects of interest to Thackeray-readers , but also a number of valuable loans from outside .

		Were it not now the vacation season , or had the forming of the collection begun earlier , the exhibi - tion would doubtless have attained larger propor - tions .

		As it is , one notes the first edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	's first book `` The
Paris	LOCATION	Sketch Book , by Mr.
Titmarsh	PERSON	, '' also '' The Second Funeral of Napoleon '' in the Werner fac-simile reprint of the original pamphlet ; and , loaned by Mr.
Francis Bullard	PERSON	, `` Vanity Fair , '' `` The Newcomes , '' and '' The Virginians , '' all in the original paper-covered monthly numbers , and collectively worth a small fortune .

		Some of the rarer American editions of
Thackeray	PERSON	's writings are also exhibited , and sev - eral interesting portraits , including reproductions of his own inimitable drawings of himself .

		A mutilated
Thackeray	PERSON	letter from the
Kate Field	ORGANIZATION	collection is to be seen , and two copies of the very scarce programme of the
Thackeray	PERSON	tableaux given at the
Boston Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	twenty-five years ago by the
Beneficent Society	ORGANIZATION	, and participated in by many prominent persons of the city .

		The exhibition will continue through
July	DATE	.

		THE PROBLEM OF THE UNUSED BOOK , of the book that cumbers the library shelves and is never read , has be.en made the object of careful study at the
Grand Rapids Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	, the librarian , describes in his current Report the careful examination of circulation records that was made in the circulation department of the library , whereby it was revealed that , out of eighty thousand vol - 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, umes , six hundred and fourteen had never budged from their places , or rather had never been drawn for home use , while there was a total of more than thirteen thousand that had remained inactive for periods of time varying from two years to forty .

		Then , to prove how many of these sluggards were hopeless cases , a plan was adopted by which they should be brought out in platoons and marshalled before the borrowing public in open cases , awaiting the call to service .

		Of the first detachment , two hundred and five in number , twenty-eight aroused themselves from their dormant condition within a month .

		`` Gradually the Library expects , '' says Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	, '' to place before the public nearly all or all of these books which , as far as the circulating work of the
Library	ORGANIZATION	is concerned , have been dead .

		It will be interesting to notice how many can be galvanized into life in this way .

		Another interest - ing fact disclosed is the number of books among these that at one time were exceedingly popular . ''

		There will remain , after this test has been carried through , the problem of dealing with the hopelessly '' dead '' books , some system of space-economizing storage being suggested by Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	, who of course would not make the discarded volumes quite inaccessible or strike their names from the cata - logue .

		It is interesting , as well as somewhat sur - prising , to note from his carefully prepared tables of statistics that biography contains more unused volumes than any other class , a fact partly due , thinks Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	, to the great number of biog - raphies `` written and published from a sense of duty , as pious memorials , rather than for any real literary or historical reason . ''

		This whole study of an important question , occupying four pages of an unusually interesting and varied library report , seems to be , in most of its details , pioneer work .

		It would be useful to have returns from other libraries concerning the same problem .

		THE FISH IN LITERATURE , as also the fish in oral narrative and reminiscence , has played an impor - tant part ; how important , may be at least partly indicated by calling attention to the size of the collection of books on angling , ichthyology , fish - culture , and kindred topics , owned by the Hon.
Daniel B. Fearing	PERSON	of
Newport	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		So noteworthy is this library that its owner enjoys the distinction of being the only book-collector honored as such with a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	degree .

		There are already more than ten thousand volumes in the collection , fifteen hundred of which were added within the
last year	DATE	, and it is still growing .

		But when one reads some of its titles , one sees less reason to wonder at the size of the library than to question whether any limits can be set to its possible growth .

		All sorts of books , travels , biography , essays , poetry , are welcomed , provided only they have some allusion to fishing or to fishes .


Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's `` Seasons '' and Pope 's `` Windsor Forest '' have a place on Mr.
Fearing	PERSON	's shelves , as do also
Thoreau	PERSON	's `` Walden '' and Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's '' Locusts and Wild Honey . ''

		Of course the
Bible	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	PERSON	and many of the Greek and Latin classics must be there , or will eventually be there , because of their references to the sport favored by the
Newport	LOCATION	collector .

		But the magni - tude of his undertaking is considerably diminished by the fact that the fish in fiction -LRB- that is , in novels -RRB- is apparently not included in his quest .

		LEGISLATORS ' ENGLISH , as is well known by this time , often leaves much to be desired in point of correctness , but it atones for this deficiency by in - jecting an unexpected and truly refreshing element of humor into the dryness and dulness of statutory law .

		For example , a
Kentucky	LOCATION	enactment forbids '' the discharge at random '' of any `` deadly weapon , whether said weapon be loaded or unloaded . ''

		It was in
Missouri	LOCATION	, however , and not in the
Bluegrass State	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- where such a law might have been expected -RRB- , that a statute was passed prescribing the ingredi - ents which alone might legally be used in the manufacture of beverages , and interdicting , by omission , the use of water for such purposes .

		A certain western
State	ORGANIZATION	, zealous in the development of its natural resources , established a horticultural commission empowered '' to employ an etymologist and establish horticultural districts . ''

		In providing for a '' State Etymologist , '' it builded better than it knew .

		The Solons of
Arizona	LOCATION	are reported to have passed a law at their late session making it a misdemeanor for any person `` to pluck an ostrich feather or plume without the consent of the posses - sor '' an enactment that must have been worded by a member of the
Audubon Society	ORGANIZATION	, or of the S. P. C. A. ... JUVENILE BOOK-HUNGER , especially as observed among the little Poles and Greeks and Portuguese and other non - Yankee children that throng the branch libraries and reading-rooms in the poorer sections of our large cities , is as eager and insati - able as a growing child 's hunger for food .

		These little fellow-citizens of ours , as noted recently at the
North Bennet Street Reading Room	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, have a wholesome craving '' not only for fairy stories and for all the mass of imaginative material in the general class of ' juvenile literature , ' but also for the books which open the world of nature and of art to their minds . '

		A book all about moths , ' ' a book where I can learn how to call the stars , ' ' a book with pictures of the
North Pole	LOCATION	, ' these are the sorts of requests which pour into the ears of the attendants in the children 's room in the North End . ''

		A further quotation may be permitted from the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's interesting Fifty - ninth Annual Report .

		`` Among the children whom we call happier than those who fill North Bennet Street there are too many who must be coaxed or driven to taste the joy of reading .

		But in
North Bennet Street	LOCATION	, the worn , shabby book is the key to a palace of delight , and the crowded rooms are positively ablaze with the sheer happiness which radiates from the faces of the scores of reading
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 boys and girls . ''

		The pity is that they have not long before this been provided with ampler quarters for their intellectual refreshment .

		At present the children crowd the rooms to suffocation , and even cluster about the windows outside to see what hope of accommodation there is for them within .

		THE LIBERTY OF A LOOSENED SPIRIT -LRB- to US6
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's apt phrase -RRB- was never better exemplified than in a touching incident reported by a member of the
Examining Committee of the Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The scene is laid in the squalid North Street reading-room . ''

		The books were being distributed from the big wooden chest , while the children crowded about as at the un - earthing of hid treasure .

		One little chap on crutches waited impatiently in the background .

		It seemed as if the last book had been taken out when his thin voice cried , ' Oh , teacher , ai n't my Brownie book come ? '

		There was a whole world of bitter disappointment in his tone .

		Then from the very bottom of the box his Brownie book was brought forth .

		He snatched it , tucked it under his arm , swung bravely off on his crutches to a corner of a table , seated himself , buttressed his elbows on the table and his head on his hands , and in two minutes had left behind him lameness and poverty and ignorance , and had become one who might well be the envy of a king . ''

		And so we leave him , his '' bequest of wings '' more than making good the loss of the free use of his legs . ''

		He ate and drank the precious words , His spirit grew robust ; He knew no more that he was poor , Nor that his frame was dust .

		He danced along the dingy days ; And this bequest of wings Was but a book .

		What liberty A loosen 'd spirit brings ! ''

		APROPOS OF THACKERAY , whose name and fame are echoing and re-echoing this
summer	DATE	over a considerable portion of the book-reading world , the centenary commemoration dinner , on
June 28	DATE	, at the Charter-house , with the reception that followed and that was graced with the presence of the novelist 's daughter
Lady Ritchie	PERSON	, who has also con - tributed many articles of interest to the
Thackeray	PERSON	exhibition opened
two days later	DATE	, deserves at least passing mention , as does the effort announced as being made to identify the chambers occupied by Pendennis in '' Hare-court , in the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, '' for the purpose of marking them with a tablet .

		Of even greater interest to most of us is the publication in the
June	DATE	''
Harper	PERSON	'' of that recently discovered
Thackeray	PERSON	manuscript entitled `` Cockney Travels , '' which the traveller 's gifted daughter has so agree - ably annotated , and which is accompanied by a characteristic letter to '' dear old Yedward ''
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	, illustrated with a drawing of `` the splendid chamber-maid at Chthlangothlen '' and another hasty sketch .

		Truly this is a rich season for the Thackeray-lovers .

		Next year the Dickensites will have their turn .

		AN ANTI-WAGNERIAN MUSIC CRITIC , whose death coincides with the appearance of the German com - poser 's noteworthy autobiography , and whose de - votion to the cause of good music extended over half a century and more , has left by his departure a vacancy in
London	LOCATION	's music world that will not soon be filled .


Joseph Bennett	PERSON	, for many years music critic of the '' Daily Telegraph , '' and latterly known as the dean of his craft in
England	LOCATION	, died
last month	DATE	at the age of eighty .

		Trained in his youth in church music , he was for a while organist at
Westminster Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, and he continued through life to cling to the old traditions , and , at least by his negative attitude , to oppose the musical trend of his times .

		At one period a warm friend of Sir
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	, he deplored what he considered the latter 's waste of unusual gifts in the composi - tion of light operas ; and this lack of sympathy finally alienated the two .

		But the world at large finds cause for rejoicing in the serious Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's failure to turn his friend from '' Pinafore '' and '' Patience '' and '' The Mikado '' to oratorios and cantatas and grand opera .

		A CLASS REUNION EXTRAORDINARY , in which every surviving member was present , though all were octogenarians and had been graduated sixty -
two years ago	DATE	, was held at the late
Williams Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege commencement .

		But it ought in truthfulness to be added that only two members of this class -LRB- ' 49 -RRB- still survive , and it will interest readers of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	to learn that one of these members is Dr.
John Bascom	PERSON	, long an honored teacher of the college , for thirteen years -LRB- 1874-87 -RRB- president of Wiscon - sin
University	ORGANIZATION	, prolific writer on literary , economic , philosophical , and religious topics , and for many years a valued contributor of book-reviews to these pages .

		Dr.
Bascom	PERSON	's home is in
Williamstown	LOCATION	, where he enjoys the consideration and respect due to a professor emeritus of distinguished services to his alma mater and as a public-spirited citizen of civic usefulness to his community .

		Nor is his fame by any means restricted to his college and his town .

		THE MULTIPLICATION OF ACADEMIC DEGREES , to the delight of those who are unhappy without a string of initials after their names , has begun with the creation of a new doctorate -LRB- which , by the way , was predicted by us a year ago in these columns -RRB- by the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The expert atten - tion now given to public health , with post-graduate courses to inculcate its principles , makes natural and fitting the bestowal of a diploma that shall specify the peculiar equipment of those who have mastered the science in its higher branches .

		Accordingly the degree of
Doctor of Public Health	ORGANIZATION	has been created by the above-named university , and the first honorary recipients of the title are the heads of the health departments of
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Detroit	LOCATION	.

		If this devising of new degrees is not carried to a ridiculous excess it may well prove a welcome relief to the strain now put on existing academic titles of honor , notably upon the much overworked LL.D .

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, THE EVOLUTION OF A POET LAUREATE .

		* Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	approaches the task of writing the autobiography of a poet laureate with all the seriousness befitting so
august	DATE	an undertaking .

		And indeed his '' Autobiog - raphy , '' now published in two handsome vol - umes of generous proportions , is in one im - portant sense an epoch-making work .

		For what other poet laureate of
England	LOCATION	has ever left behind him a full and satisfying history of his gradual development from the grub of liter - ature-nibbling immaturity , through the chrys - alis of meditative and silent growth , into the glorious creature of aerial flight and tireless wing ?

		Not one ; nor -LRB- our still hale and vigor - ous and youthful though no longer young Mr.
Austin	PERSON	will join us in hoping -RRB- shall we soon have such another autobiography of a court poet of
Britain	LOCATION	.

		The `` difficult and dangerous undertaking '' which he at the outset confesses such a work to be , though he applies the words to faithful autobiography in general , is not likely to be essayed more than once in several generations .

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	was born at
Headingley	ORGANIZATION	, near
Leeds	LOCATION	,
May 30 , 1835	DATE	, his father being a wool - stapler -LRB- the last in a line of apparently pros - perous wool-staplers -RRB- , and his mother a
Locke	LOCATION	, sister of that
Joseph Locke	PERSON	who with
Robert Stevenson	PERSON	made the plans and specifications for the first railway in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Intellectually clever she was not , '' writes her son , '' but she was supremely intelligent ; and her love of music , together with quickness and retentive - ness of it , as of old Songs and Ballads , was great . ''

		The young
Alfred	PERSON	was reared in the faith of his paternal ancestors , the Roman Catholic , and was therefore debarred from the privileges of an Oxford or
Cambridge	LOCATION	educa - tion ; but the Jesuit and other sectarian schools he attended were strong in the classics , and it was to these and kindred studies that he felt himself most powerfully drawn .

		Before he was fourteen he was well-grounded in
Latin	LOCATION	, French , and Greek , and was an eager reader of everything readable that came within his reach .

		At eighteen he passed the examination for the bachelor 's degree at
London University	ORGANIZATION	, which at that time was empowered only to ex - amine and confer degrees on the students of * THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF
ALFRED AUSTIN	PERSON	, POET LAUREATE .

		Study for the bar followed , and he was called in
1857	DATE	, but practised his profes - sion only three years , when a modest legacy from his uncle
Joseph Locke	PERSON	enabled him to abandon an irksome routine and devote himself to the muses .


Italy	LOCATION	and poetry and the publi - cation of his first book -LRB- ''
Randolph	PERSON	, a tale of Polish Grief '' -RRB- , and other delightful matters , came crowding close upon one another at about this time , and the reader is made to feel how glorious and joyous a thing it was to the misfit lawyer to be free , with all the world before him and no achievement in literature too ex - alted to be beyond the range of possibility .

		Courtship and marriage -LRB- to Miss
Hester Mulock	PERSON	-RRB- came in due course , and thereafter a life of in - creasing happiness and of growing absorption in the interests and pursuits that most appealed to him .

		Not without cause does Mr.
Austin	PERSON	say of his book , in its opening paragraph : '' I observe the prevailing note is one of cheerful - ness , due in great measure to the unmerited good fortune that has attended the writer since he had full liberty to make good or ill use of the opportunities presented by life . ''

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's years in
Rome	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	and elsewhere in
Italy	LOCATION	fell at a fortunate time .

		The changes and modernizations that were soon to follow had not then been dreamed of , and the number of congenial fellow-countrymen sojourning in that land of sunshine was large .

		We find him enjoying the society of
Charles Lever	PERSON	and his family ,
Thomas Adolphus Trollope	PERSON	and Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	,
Miss Isa Blagden	PERSON	-LRB- whom the reader will remember as the intimate friend of the Brownings -RRB- ,
Lady Orford	LOCATION	and her two young daughters , Sir
George	PERSON	and
Lady Otway	LOCATION	, and , among foreigners , Pulszki the Hungarian patriot and exile , Bakounin the Russian nihilist , and others .

		It is a little strange that we find no mention of either Robert or Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	in these Italian wanderings , nor any of Walter Savage Landor ; but the fact that it was not until the
summer of 1860	DATE	that the first journey was made prob - ably explains the matter sufficiently .

		Among passages of peculiar interest , either as relating to the development of the poet or as containing his reflections on the art of poetry , a few may be selected for quotation here from the two ample volumes whose pages contain so much that will attract the student of Victorian literature .

		In one of these Mr.
Austin	PERSON	pleas - antly recalls his days of thraldom as a
London	LOCATION	law student .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL '' On
Sundays	DATE	I not infrequently spent half the day at
Wimbledon	LOCATION	, rural and unspoilt in those days , with some old friends of my own people , and who extended to me the greatest kindness .

		But it was the sights and sounds of Nature that gave me then , as since , the chief of my pleasures .

		To hear , as I walked up from the station to their house , the lark singing its way aloft , to wander and sit among the gorse on the Common , to listen to my accomplished hostess playing the Sonatas of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, these constituted my real life , and not '
Sugden	PERSON	on Powers , ' somebody else on * Remainders , ' or the ' Settlements ' and ' Conveyances ' submitted to my inspection .

		Attendance at Lectures in
Hall	PERSON	, and eating one 's Dinners there , for three years , sufficed in those days , if one had a
University Degree	ORGANIZATION	, to qualify one for admission to the Bar ; and of these facilities I availed myself .


Maine	LOCATION	was the Lecturer , the most erudite of his class ; and , while he discoursed , I read some classical work or other in a living or dead tongue . ''

		No poetry , declares Mr.
Austin	PERSON	, is thor - oughly appreciated until it is known by heart ; and that he knows a good deal of it by heart is apparent to his readers .

		It must be added , however , that his quotations are in the great majority of instances from his own poems , whole pages of which are frequently given as the readiest means known to the author for depicting his state of mind at a certain time , or for presenting to view the successive stages in the evolution of the poet .

		Of his early readings , after
Scott	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, he men - tions Pope , Gray ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, and continues : '' I turned to them with almost equal interest , and they acted as a corrective , or complement at least , to
Scott	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	; thus early confirming in me what I then suspected , and have long been assured of , that the best poetry is romantic in feeling and classical in expression .

		A potent stimulus to this conception of the dignity and character of poetry was imparted by my first acquaintance with the
Iliad	LOCATION	; nor was this confined to school hours or the time assigned to study at
St. Edward 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the ensuing holidays , my sister
Winifred	PERSON	had to listen while I stood on the seat of the summer-house at
Headingley	LOCATION	, and declaimed to her Pope 's version of the oratorical or sanguinary sequel to the fugitive frailty of
Helen	PERSON	. ''

		A little clearer and better-expressed than the conclusion of the foregoing is this from his first visit to
Italy	LOCATION	: `` The six months I spent in
Rome	LOCATION	were almost wholly barren of poetic production ; but as I had come to
Rome	LOCATION	for
Rome	LOCATION	's own sake , and for the quiet in - struction and enjoyment I expected and received from it , I did not at the time trouble myself with that cir - cumstance .

		I did not then , any more than since , regard poetry as something to be produced by the mere exercise of the will ; and during my first sojourn in
Rome	LOCATION	, the occasions were few that spontaneously gave birth to it . ''

		One of these few occasions a sleepless night during which the poet lay listening to the plashing of the fountain in the square beneath his window gave birth to a poem of some length -LRB- '' Two Visions '' -RRB- which is reproduced a smoothly-flowing piece of verse with some picturesque passages and apt phrases , but not perhaps quite worth a whole night 's sleep .

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's connection with the
London	LOCATION	'' Standard '' gives occasion for considerable interesting reminiscence , notably in connection with the Franco-German War , whose progress he reported for the above-named journal , and many of the chief actors with whom he came into contact .

		Some good near-views of
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck , whom the journalist could not but greatly admire , are furnished , as also a picture of
Paris	LOCATION	in the closing days of the siege , and a more than glimpse of
Berlin	LOCATION	en jete and the triumphal entry of the victorious home-coming troops .

		But here is something more interest - ing , about Tennyson : `` When I left , he walked with me as far as the wooden gate that led into the lane I had come by , and , in answer to my expressing the hope that I should be welcome if I came to see him again , he said , but in a half-gruff manner , as though he disliked saying anything agreeable , ' I shall always be gkd to see you . '

		But just before this Au revoir !

		he said to me , as we leaned over the gate , ' What a vulgar people the English are !

		They come here , to watch for me ; and when they see me , they exclaim quite loudly , '' There 's Tennyson . '' '

		I repeated this afterwards to Mrs.
Stuart Hodgson	PERSON	, whereupon she said that he would have been much more annoyed if they did not come .

		I believe this to be true , and to arise from , if I may use what may seem to some a paradoxical expression , the intricate sim - plicity of his character .

		I once heard
Hutton	PERSON	and
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	, in talking of him , differ utterly as to his disposition ; one maintaining that he was the most self - conscious , and the other that he was the simplest of men .

		He seemed to me to be both ; but he had been made self-conscious by others , whereas his simplicity was congenital with him , and remained part of himself .

		To me the union of the two added to his attractiveness ; and , after that first meeting , I went away liking him exceedingly . ''

		The author further eulogizes his '' never-to-be - forgotten predecessor in the Laureateship '' as '' the greatest Poet of our time , and certainly the most popular , '' forgetting that in popularity , from the bookseller 's point of view ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	exceeded him .

		With good taste and commendable restraint , Mr.
Austin	PERSON	makes but brief reference to his ap - pointment as poet laureate , though he makes it evident that he was duly conscious of the honor conferred .

		His book closes with the death of Edward the seventh and the completion of his own seventy-fifth year .

		It is with good reason that he looks back complacently on those seventy - five years and views with a contented serious - ness what he has done to make them full years 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, and not unmeniorable .

		But the world has a cruel way of refusing to take altogether seriously a man who takes himself too much so ; and thus our autobiographer , with his somewhat con - spicuous lack of humor , becomes , in a manner the reverse of Falstaff 's , the cause of humor in other men .

		We must not close without com - mending the excellent workmanship , in typo - graphy and illustration , that adds so much to the attractiveness of the two volumes .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE
FRANKFORT	LOCATION	BOOK FAIR .

		* In the reproduction of the ''
Francofordiense Emporium	PERSON	of
Henri Estienne	PERSON	, '' Mr.
James Westfall Thompson	PERSON	and the
Caxton Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	have made a noteworthy contribution to the literature of the book-trade and to the literature of scholarship .

		The monograph , which is now for the first time presented with the advantage of an English version , of a compre - hensive introduction , and of elucidating notes , has long been famous in the literature of the book-trade , and as one of the most distinctive professional productions ever made by a pub - lisher .

		The author ,
Henri Estienne	PERSON	the second , is probably entitled to the highest rank among the printer - publishers who were not only manu - facturers of books but who contributed authori - tative scholarship as well to original writing as to the editorial work of preparing for the press the texts of books accepted as classics .

		The contribution of
Henri Estienne	PERSON	the first -LRB- whose work was done between the years
1496	DATE	and
1520	DATE	-RRB- to the development of printing was more important than that of his grandson whose pub - lishing undertakings began in
1554	DATE	and ended with his death in
1598	DATE	; but the contributions of the younger
Estienne	PERSON	, in scholarly editing , in original literary production , and in work for the development of the book-trade and the fur - thering of the machinery for the distribution of books , constituted together the most valuable service rendered by any one of the long series of distinguished publishers of
France	LOCATION	.

		As a scholar among the publishers ,
Henri Estienne	PERSON	the second occupies , as pointed out , a high , if not the highest , position in a series which began with the institution in
Venice	LOCATION	, in
1494	DATE	, of the printing press of
Aldus Manutius	ORGANIZATION	.

		The undertakings of
Aldus	ORGANIZATION	were , of course , * THE FKANCOFORDIENSK EMPORIUM of
Henri Estienne	PERSON	.

		Edited , with historical introduction , Latin text with English translation , and notes , by
James Westfall Thompson	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .

		Chicago : The
Caxton Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		carried on under very much greater difficulties than those which had to be met by
Estienne	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION
a half century later	DATE	.

		In the time of
Aldus	ORGANIZATION	, there was practically no organization of the book-trade ; and the facilities for reaching possible customers throughout
Europe	LOCATION	with cor - respondence and with books , and of securing from the buyers the remittances for books de - livered , were very meagre .

		When
Aldus	ORGANIZATION	had taken the risk , with the aid of his friend and editorial associate Musurus , of bringing into print an edition of a Greek text , his labors had only begun .

		It was then necessary for him to come into correspondence with scholars in dis - tant convents and in the few university centres , and to make clear to these correspondents the purpose and character of the Greek literature that he was attempting to introduce into
Europe	LOCATION	.

		If he could persuade the correspondent to send an order for the book , he then had the task of securing its safe transportation , often at a time when inter - state connections were interrupted by war ; and , finally , he had to wait for many weary months before an opportunity occurred for a safe sending of the payment due .

		It is not to be wondered at that , with a passion for the production of scholarly , and particularly of Greek , literature at a time when the demand for such literature had still to be created ,
Aldus	ORGANIZATION	should , after long years of painstaking labor , have died a poor man .

		In the middle of the sixteenth century , at the time of the beginning of the work of
Henri Estienne	PERSON	the second , a more scholarly public , interested in the purchase of editions of liter - ature known as classical , had been created , and machinery was in existence through which these possible buyers in universities , in ecclesiastical centres , and among the better educated of the nobility , could be reached .

		The book-trade itself had been organized ; and the most important evidence and factor in such organization was the great Book Fair held in
Frankfort	LOCATION	.

		Frank - fort had from the early part of the thirteenth century been utilized as the headquarters for a semi-annual fair at which were distributed all classes of goods brought together from all parts of the world .

		The institution at this Fair of a section devoted to the sale of books dates back to
1480	DATE	.

		Immediately after the beginning of printing ,
Frankfort	LOCATION	had become an important centre for book production ; and during the century preceding
1450	DATE	, the manuscript trade in
Frankfort	LOCATION	had been more important than that of any other city in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Estienne made a practice of being in
Frank	LOCATION	,
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL fort twice a year with samples of his beautifully printed books and with the announcements of the books that he had in preparation or in plan .

		It was his custom to utilize the counsel of rep - resentatives of the book-trade gathered together from all parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, for advice as to the wisdom , from a business point of view , of undertakings that he had in plan .

		With his own keen ambition to further the production and distribution of scholarly literature , it not infrequently happened , as he naively reports in his correspondence , that the publication of books which he believed would prove of material service to scholars throughout
Europe	LOCATION	was advised against by practical book - selling friends on the ground that although they would undoubtedly be welcomed , they would not be wanted by enough people .

		The problem of
Henri Estienne	PERSON	in regard to works of this class differs not at all from that of pub - lishers of to-day .

		The character of the books that
Estienne	PERSON	carried with him to
Frankfort	LOCATION	may be indicated by a brief selection from his publishing list .

		The first book issued with his individual imprint -LRB- after the death of his father
Robert	PERSON	-RRB- was an edition of the
Odes of Anacreon	ORGANIZATION	, printed in
1554	DATE	.

		The volume con - tains , in addition to the Greek text , a Latin version of the Odes , prepared by the publisher himself .

		During
1555	DATE	,
Estienne	PERSON	was busy in
Italy	LOCATION	collecting and collating manuscripts .

		In
1556	DATE	he issued an edition of the Psalms in a Latin version .

		This was the combined work of
George Buchanan	PERSON	a Scotchman ,
M. A. Flamin	PERSON	- ius an Italian ,
Solomon Macrinus	PERSON	a Frenchman , and Helius Eobanus a German .

		The work was completed under the editorial supervision of Estienne himself .

		In this year , he began work with a group of scholars whom he had brought together for the purpose , on his great `` Thesaurus Graecus . ''

		In
1557	DATE	,
Estienne	PERSON	produced editions of .

		/
Eschylus	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	, Theophrastus , and Athenagoras ; also the ''
Lexicon Ciceronianum	PERSON	^ Graeco-Latinum . ''

		This last was his own compilation .

		In
1558	DATE
Henri	ORGANIZATION	gave evidence of the impor - tance of his relations with
Germany	LOCATION	by accept - ing the appellation of Typographus illustris viri
Huldrici Fuggeri	PERSON	, etc. .

		Huldric
Fugger	PERSON	was a native of
Augsburg	LOCATION	, born in
1526	DATE	.

		He belonged to a family conspicuous for its anti- quity , its mercantile ability , and its wealth .

		He was himself a scholar , and he became an eminent patron of literary men .

		He expended great sums in the purchase of trustworthy manuscripts of ancient authors and in having produced from these satisfactory printed edi - tions .

		After some experimenting ,
Fugger	PERSON	finally selected
Estienne	PERSON	as the printer whose work could best be trusted to meet his own high standard of accuracy and beauty .

		The
Fugger	PERSON	family had for several generations carried on business not only as merchants and bankers but as what we should call forwarding agents .

		As far back as the time of
Aldus	ORGANIZATION	,
Estienne	PERSON	had found the Fuggers the most responsible people through whom to make de - livery of books to his correspondents through - out
Europe	LOCATION	and through whom to secure later collection of the accounts .

		But the distribut - ing and collecting machinery of even so great a
House	ORGANIZATION	as
Fugger	PERSON	could not be trusted to work smoothly in time of war .

		In
1558	DATE	Estienne issued the Edicts of Jus - tinian , printed in Greek and Latin ; in
1559	DATE	, the '' Bibliotheca '' of Diodorus with annota - tions of his own , and in
1561	DATE	the complete writings of Xenophon ; in
1568	DATE	, the Catechism of
Calvin	PERSON	translated into Greek by the pub - lisher , and a treatise , original with himself , on the relations between Greek and Latin ; in
1564	DATE	''
Fragmenta Postarum Veterum Latinorum	PERSON	. ''

		This latter work was undertaken out of regard for the memory of his father , who had begun the collection of the material .

		In the same year he issued a Greek Anthology , with annotations by the publisher .

		By way of exciting the emulation of young poets ,
Henri	PERSON	introduced into his annotations fifty transla - tions of a single distich .

		In
1566	DATE	he issued the histories of Herodotus in a Latin version , and later an '' Apologia pro Herodoto . ''

		This latter became famous , and was brought into print throughout
Europe	LOCATION	in a number of edi - tions , the latest one being that of the
Hague	LOCATION	in
1735	DATE	.

		In
1568	DATE	he issued '' Annotationes in Sophoclem et Euripidem ,
Henrici Stephani	PERSON	. ''

		This book is evidence that such little matters as the battles of St.
Denis	PERSON	and
Jarnac	LOCATION	were not permitted to interfere either with the classical studies or with the printing-office work of the publisher .

		In
1572	DATE	Estienne completed the most important production of his busy life , '' Thesaurus Graecae Linguae , ab Henrico Stephano constructus , '' etc. , in four volumes , folio , with two supplementary volumes contain - ing an appendix and an index .

		A year later was issued a seventh volume , with two glossaries and a treatise on the dialects of
Attica	LOCATION	.

		This '' Thesaurus Graecus '' was completed by
Henri	PERSON	at about the same age as that at which his father
Robert	PERSON	had published his Latin Thesau - 42 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, rus .

		These two works would have been , for any generation of publishers , creditable ex - amples of scholarly and public-spirited enter - prise .

		In
1574	DATE	Estienne brought to completion a magnificent impression of the works of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, the editorial work on which had been done chiefly by himself .

		According to
Mattaire	LOCATION	, hardly a single typographical error is to be found in the three volumes .

		The first volume is dedicated to
Elizabeth of England	LOCATION	, the second to
James VI	PERSON	.

		of
Scotland	LOCATION	, and the third to the Republic of
Berne	LOCATION	.

		When we remember that publishers like
Robert	PERSON	and
Henri	PERSON	were the compilers of the notes , commentaries , and separate treatises , which make up a large por - tion of the volumes , and that their labor as editors and as authors was carried on in stormy times and amidst the engrossing cares of an absorbing business , the Thesauri remain magnificent monuments of the scholarship , the capacity , and the persistent energy of the two Estiennes .

		The Thesaurus , like not a few other public-spirited undertakings of scholarly publishers , brought to this author-publisher loss instead of profit .

		King
Henry the Third	ORGANIZATION	, '' in consideration of the great service rendered by
Estienne	PERSON	to
France	LOCATION	and to literature , '' promised him , in
1578	DATE	, a donation of three thousand livres ; but the money was never paid .

		As , however , this was a year of active warfare between the
Catholic League	ORGANIZATION	and the Protest - ants , there may have been some excuse for the failure of the King to keep his promise .

		In
1568	DATE	,
Henri	PERSON	had printed his '' Epistola de suae typographies statu , '' etc. .

		This presents , in an Index librorum , a record of his publishing undertakings , together with a description of the purpose and character of the great '' Thesaurus . ''

		A portion of the '' Epistola '' is devoted to a recital of the injuries done to the authors of classical antiquity by ignorant and careless editors , and by credulous printers , ready to accept on the authority of such editors new readings and unfounded `` emendations '' in the text .

		The '' Epistola '' closes with a humorous complaint of the trivial and harassing interrup - tions to which a scholarly publisher is exposed , at the
Frankfort	LOCATION	Fair and elsewhere , from applicants for information concerning his pub - lishing undertakings and plans .

		The complaint is printed in Latin iambics .

		It will be noted that the Index librorum , or general catalogue , of
Estienne	PERSON	had been prepared for the purpose of answering in print inquiries from corres - pondents .

		Aldus had been driven to a similar course as early as
1498	DATE	, but even in
1568	DATE	catalogues were the exception rather than the rule .

		I quote from the English version of Greswell . ''

		I 'm harassed by the crowd of those At
Frankfort	LOCATION	who their wares expose ; And ever ask , ' What are you doing In prospect of the Fair ensuing ?

		New works you 'll show , impressions splendid , Where learning stands by Art commended ? '

		If I say ' No , ' 'T is strange !

		what , none ?

		At least then promise ' next but one . '

		Still say I ' No , ' expostulation Assumes the tone of indignation That
Frankfort	LOCATION	's mart 's so strongly slighted , And faith is broken never plighted .

		Again , these quidnuncs set aside , With letters , ceaseless , I 'm annoyed , Italian , English , German , French , All on my studious hours entrench .

		1 What last has been achieved and ended ?

		What are the impressions next intended ? '

		Nor to such modest queries stinted , Of books in print or to be printed A thousand others they propound Which e ` en a prophet would confound .

		Of what advantage all these letters ?

		Not stimulants are they , but fetters , As though you 'd spur a steed that 's idle , Yet check his progress with the bridle .

		My press resists the condensation That to such foppery gives attention ; Stands still and bids them longer stay for All they suggest , or even pay for .

		For this annoyance then , be sure Not small intent to find a cure .

		Of books to former fairs I 've given , Or now project by leave of heaven , These pages few , as best may suit you , In form of catalogue salute you ; Which you 'll my Rescript please to call , Addrest to none and yet to all . ''

		Henri 's complaints concerning futile and troublesome correspondents might , of course , be repeated to-day in many a publishing office ; but the modern publisher is helped out of the difficulty to some extent by his stenographers and typewriters .

		It remains a marvel how it was possible , without any such time-saving appliances , for the publisher of the fifteenth century to conduct a complicated business , to give personal attention to preparing for the press works calling for original scholarship and continued labor , and to carry on , in autograph letters , his various forms of correspondence .


Estienne	PERSON	's account of the
Frankfort	LOCATION	Fair was brought into print in
1574	DATE	.

		The mono - graph was written for the purpose of expressing the cordial acknowledgments of the
Paris	LOCATION	pub - lisher for the hospitality and services that had been extended to him , as to the representatives generally of the world 's book-trade , in the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 German city .

		The volume is dedicated to the council and members of the
Senate of Frank	ORGANIZATION	- fort .

		The author is interested not only in emphasizing the importance of the service ren - dered to the world by the wise administrators of the
Frankfort	LOCATION	Fair , but the personal satis - faction secured by visitors to the great city .

		Says Estienne : '' One leaves
Frankfort	LOCATION	with regret , one returns to it with pleasure . ''

		The monograph does not undertake to pre - sent any detailed history of the Book Fair , or even an analysis or specific description of its organization .

		Estienne is writing to the repre - sentatives of the government of the city and on behalf of the members of the book-trade ; he does not undertake , therefore , to convey inform - ation to people who are already familiar with the subject .

		Fortunately , however , the history of the
Frankfort	LOCATION	Book Fair has been given in detail by a number of writers in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It was in connection with the
Frankfort	LOCATION	Book Fair that the organization of the book-trade of
Germany	LOCATION	was brought about .

		The book-trade association of
Germany	LOCATION	dates from
1503	DATE	, and has been continued and developed without break , during a period of more than four centuries , on practically the lines that were laid down in the preliminary organization .

		The German book - trade was the first in
Europe	LOCATION	to bring about an organization of its business ; and it is because this organization is to-day more intelligent in plan and more effective in operation than that of any other country , that the production and distribution of books in
Germany	LOCATION	is carried on to the best advantage of all parties concerned .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	alone , among all the literature - producing and literature-consuming states of the world , can the special student or the general reader be assured of securing , in even the smallest town , a full representation of the liter - ature of the day and of the literature of past years , together with the service of an intelligent and often scholarly bookdealer to meet his in - quiries and fulfil his requirements .

		No author - ities in
Germany	LOCATION	, either of the individual states or of the imperial government , have ever under - taken to restrict the right of the producers of copyrighted property , and of their assigns , to control the conditions under which the books are distributed and sold .

		As a result , the reader in
Germany	LOCATION	secures , at a lower cost than any - where else in the world , books representing an even and satisfactory quality of manufacture , and the highest standard of scholarly accuracy and authority .

		The buyer can also be assured that he is paying in one town precisely the same price at which the book could be published in any other town in the realm .

		The publishers and booksellers are , under the system in force , in a position to prevent books from being utilized by dry-goods dealers , or by dealers in any mer - chandise , as an advertisement for their own goods .

		There is in
Germany	LOCATION	too high an esteem for the interests of the producers as well as for those of the consumers of literature , and too clear an understanding of the intellectual re - quirements of the community , to permit the undermining of bookselling machinery , which is the sure result of the use of books for adver - tising purposes .

		Under the law , no German publishers can be accused of '' conspiracy '' because they take measures to prevent the book - sellers from being driven into bankruptcy .

		This result is due to an intelligent understanding , which goes back to the
Frankfort	LOCATION	Fair of
1503	DATE	, of the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the book trade ; and
Estienne	PERSON	, and the other intelligent publishers and booksellers who gathered together in
Frankfort	LOCATION	, were well justified in the cordial recognition given by them to the civilized intelligence with which the business was managed by their
Frankfort	LOCATION	hosts .

		The essay of
Estienne	PERSON	has for centuries been an exceedingly scarce volume .

		Professor
Thompson	PERSON	has rendered a distinctive service to all who are interested in the history of the book - trade , and to scholarship generally , in making this essay available for readers of the twentieth century not only in the original -LRB- Latin -RRB- text but in an excellent English version .

		The editor 's Introduction to the essay has a much larger his - torical value than is possessed by the essay itself .

		It is an admirable survey of the methods employed during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for the production and distribution of books .

		Professor
Thompson	PERSON	has made a painstaking investigation of all the literature of the subject .

		His references and credits are so comprehensive and complete that the essay constitutes a sat - isfactory bibliographical guide .

		In addition , however , to the marginal references , Professor
Thompson	PERSON	has supplied a complete bibliography of the subject .

		It remains only to say that the book as printed -LRB- in a limited edition of 303 copies -RRB- constitutes a creditable and most beau - tiful example of American typography , a credit alike to the
Caxton Club	ORGANIZATION	and to the
Alderbrink Press	ORGANIZATION	.

AMAZON	LOCATION	.

		* The tide of travel-books is obviously turning .

		For the last year or so ,
South America	LOCATION	has been almost keeping up with
Europe	LOCATION	, and al - ready we have had our fill of the narrative of the ordinary conventional South American trip down the west coast , across the Andes to
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	, and up the Brazilian coast , or vice versa .

		Specific countries are now taken up with volumes to themselves ; or if the nar - rative is personal , it must indeed treat of an unusual exploit to obtain a hearing .

		Such a personal narrative is Dr.
H. J. Mozans	PERSON	' story of his trip from
Panama	LOCATION	to
Lima	LOCATION	, his minute examination of not only Inca ruins but of the remains of the Spanish conquistador es , and thence -LRB- the unusual part -RRB- his exploration of the
Amazon	LOCATION	from source to mouth .

		Much more , however , than the mere record of the trip , interesting as that is , is presented here .

		From first to last we feel the author 's interest , often enthusiasm , for the scenes witnessed and for the people among whom he travelled .

		According to Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, who supplies the Introduction , the author '' is peculiarly fit to interpret for us our neighbors to the south , and describes them with sympathy , insight , and understanding granted but to few . ''

		In even more glowing colors does he paint the scenery of his unique trip , colors which to some may seem not too nicely laid on .

		His first sight of the
Ecuador	LOCATION	- ian Andes drew from him , such expressions as the following : '' Rising majestically far above the boundless forests at their feet , their snow - capped peaks are , of a truth , the companions of ' the morning star at dawn , ' and of Hesperus at eventide , while during their mighty vigils they are visited by ' troops of stars ' that silently hymn their Creator 's praise . ''

		The chapter on the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal is a worthy introduction ; and , since for the work done at
Panama	LOCATION	the author has naught but praise , tends to put all good patriots , and especially Rooseveltians , in a comfortable frame of mind .

		The history of the various attempts at canal - building is admirably succinct .

		To enable us to realize the continuity of the enterprise , we are taken back to
Cortes	PERSON	, who was apparently the first to propose a canal here , his aim being the solution of the old problem of the North - west Passage .

		failed to share his father 's views , and concluded that '' it would be contrary to the Divine Will to unite two oceans which the Creator of the world had separated , and that to attempt so impious a deed would surely provoke some ap - palling catastrophe . ''

		When we realize that the death-rate among the employees of the French company rose to over four hundred out of a thousand , we can better conceive the mag - nitude of the task that confronted the indomi - table Colonel Gorgas .


Panama	LOCATION	is the oldest European city on the mainland of the
New World	LOCATION	.

		In the pages which follow , as in his admir - able work dealing with
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Colombia	LOCATION	, Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	has endeavored not only to give a picture of the country and the people as he saw them , but also to summarize their hopes , aspi - rations , and prospects ; he has also discussed certain topics and reflections that must present themselves to every traveller in the land of the Incas , especially when he contemplates the wonderful monuments scattered over that vast territory .

		In doing this , he has drawn freely on the works of the early chroniclers , most of whom are still unknown to English readers ; and , where advisable , he has summarized the conclusions of the most competent investigators .

		His wealth of quotation , not only from among these more or less scientific facts , but especially from a wide knowledge of Latin and English poetry , is no less than amazing .

		u It is pleasant , '' says Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, `` to travel in company with one who knows books as well as men and man - ners , and who yet cares also for all that is beau - tiful and terrible and grand in nature . ''

		It is no less a pleasure to travel with one whose criticisms and comments are so kindly , generous , and constructive .

		It is easy to find fault with our southern neighbors hard to bridge the lack of sympathy and understanding between them and us .

		With the means for sup - plying this gap , Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	deals interestingly in his last chapter .

		He is perhaps rather too optimistic , and takes insufficient account of the racial differences which no amount of interna - tional congresses and newspaper good-will can permanently efface .

		Even that much-heralded agent for international friendship , the Pan -
American Union	ORGANIZATION	, is regarded by our Latin neighbors as artificial , to be used by them chiefly as a means for staving off undue
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean influence .

		Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	gives due space to the notorious poverty of our trade with
South America	LOCATION	, a lack of commercial enterprise which is held to
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 be not only a financial but a political failing .

		The crux of the matter seems to be , not that too few steamers ply between our ports and theirs , but that , setting out with full holds , they more often than not come back empty .

		With the notable exception of rubber , coffee , sugar , and tin ,
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	and Rio and the rest export as a rule the same kind of goods that we do ; and accordingly we have little use for what they have to give us .

		The corollary to the first complaint is the indiffer - ence and ineptness of the North American business man in his South American trade .

		It is merely a proof that he has not yet awakened to the tremendous possibilities of that trade ; for if he were really and vitally interested , it would not take him long to get over that failing .

		Since American articles , he reasons , are as near perfect as need be , there is no need to take pains ; and if Brazilians prefer German machinery to ours , the loss is theirs .

		On these practical questions , Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	' conclusions are in the main sound .

		It is a pleasure to be able keenly to endorse his his - torical views his ardent but discriminating praise of
Pizarro	PERSON	, his estimate of the services of the early missionaries and friars , and a gen - erally sane point of view regarding the con - quistadores , whose only apology need be their environment and training .

		In fact , the purely personal element personal to the point of monotony -LRB- such as sentence after sentence of '' From here I went to there , stopping on the way at Blank '' -RRB- largely yields place to a delightful narrative style , free from egotism , even eschewing names of the author 's compan - ions and hosts to a most impersonal degree .

		It is a pity that in a work which will have unique value in so many ways , some faults of book-making should have crept in .

		Though the form of the book itself leaves nothing to be desired , the illustrations are not always clear ; the proof-reading is lamentably careless , not only in punctuation but also in spelling ; and the index is most inadequate .

		Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt '' can recall no work on
South America	LOCATION	so well worth reading . ''

		One result , at least , of a careful perusal will be the happy one of an increased faith in the destiny of these fascinat - ing republics .

		If all the women were just like those nurses , I decidedly agree with the suffragettes .

		But I think the noble slaves of the gentle and fairer sex should not be so rough to box the policemen or throw stones to the window glasses . ''


Yoshio Mariano	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Mar	PERSON	kino 's opinion , written after a sojourn in a
London	LOCATION	hospital , will probably meet with rather general approval .

		The mili - tant suffragettes , at first regarded with amuse - ment , have come to be thought of with alarm and indignation in many quarters .

		At the same time , they have certainly succeeded in bringing the question of votes for women to the front , with a fair prospect of satisfactory results .

		I recall a little incident of
twenty-five years ago	DATE	, which illustrates the earlier attitude toward female suffrage .

		At that time I lived in a
London	LOCATION	suburb , and had for neighbor a prominent M. P. , who represented a constitu - ency in
Durham	LOCATION	.

		At a local meeting , this eminent person spoke his mind vigorously against allowing women to vote , although , as we understood , he was considered an advocate of women 's suffrage in
Durham	LOCATION	.

		Indignant at this duplicity , I took occasion to send a report of the meeting to one of the papers , and was pleased to hear that it got our politician into some trouble .

		In those days it was the popular thing to approve of '' votes for women '' with a wink , as it were .

		A good Liberal might declare in favor of this thing , gaining thereby a certain advantage , but confident that nothing would be done .

		Some were no doubt sincere , but subsequent events have only too clearly proved that my neighbor at
Bedford Park	LOCATION	was no worse than most of his associates .

		In view of the humbug and apathy which existed , it is really amazing that a few women have in about five years been able to gather so much support , and make so much trouble in
England	LOCATION	, that their demands are seriously con - * THE SUFFRAGETTE .

July 16	DATE	, sidered and likely to be granted by parliament .

		If we agree that their cause is a good one , we must at least give them credit for getting results , however much we may wish they could have used other methods .

		It will , perhaps , always remain an open question whether the extraordinary tactics of the militants were really needed to compel attention ; it is at least certain that nothing but extreme necessity could justify them .

		Those of us who have depended principally on the daily press for our knowledge have probably been misled in cer - tain particulars , but more especially have lacked much information necessary to sound judgment .

		Miss
Pankhurst	PERSON	's book , `` The Suffragette , '' gives a full and well-illustrated account of the militant suffrage movement in
England	LOCATION	down to the end of
1910	DATE	, and , so far as the reviewer is able to judge , is essentially accurate and fair .

		Opening it with a distinct prejudice against the militants , and expecting to find a good deal of nonsense , I was soon adrift on the cur - rent of the narrative , very glad to be carried through the whirlpools and rapids of those exciting years , regretful when obliged to dis - embark at the end of the printed story , well aware that all was not finished .

		As a piece of historical writing , the book will deserve to live ; and no doubt in the days when this particular struggle is over , posterity will read it with amazement at the things they used to do in those '' unregenerate days . ''

		However much any reader may disapprove of the militant tactics , he can not fail to appre - ciate the fact that these women have been and are fighting for a principle , showing the utmost courage and endurance in carrying out their plans .

		Men who have done such things have been regarded as heroes , even when their of - fenses have been far more serious than those of the women .

		On the other hand , it would be difficult to say anything in favor of the shuffling and evasive attitude of the professional politicians , while the brutality shown in dealing with the suffragettes almost passes belief .

		The reader is constantly aware that had he been present at the affairs described , he would most assuredly have been arrested , for he could not have quietly witnessed such outrages as were committed .


John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, in '' The Sub - jection of Women , '' now opportunely repub - lished , has a passage which might have been used by
Miss Pankhurst	PERSON	as a sort of prefatory note to her book . ''

		History gives a cruel experience of human nature , in showing how exactly the regard due to the life , possessions , and entire earthly happiness of any class of persons , was measured by what they had the power of enforcing ; how all who made any resistance to authorities that had arms in their hands , however dreadful might be the provocation , had not only the law of force , but all other laws , and all the notions of social obligation , against them ; and in the eyes of those whom they resisted , were not only guilty of crime , but of the worst of all crimes , deserving the most cruel chastisement which human beings could inflict . ''

		Miss
Seawell	PERSON	's much advertised little book , '' The Ladies ' Battle , '' is of course rampantly anti-suffrage , and is claimed by the publishers to represent adequately that side of the question .

		It nowhere appears in the book that it is really republished , with additions , from an article which appeared in the '' Atlantic Monthly '' of
September , 1910	DATE	.

		If one were inclined to take it seriously , it might serve as a text for a long discussion ; but it may suffice at the present time to cite a characteristic passage . ''

		In
New York State	ORGANIZATION	, the suffragists , under the lead of the late Miss
Anthony	PERSON	, strove for years to have habitual drunkenness made a cause of absolute divorce , instead of legal separation .

		This illustrates in a peculiar manner the short-sightedness of most of the legislation proposed by the suffragists .

		A man , anxious to get rid of his wife , but having no legal cause , could , by the simple process of continually getting drunk , offer a strong inducement to his wife , to get a divorce . ''

		-LRB- p. 109 . -RRB-

		It is fearful to think what will ensue when hus - bands all over the country '' get on '' to this .

		These simple processes , leading to such awful evils , ought really to be kept secret .

		It may leak out that there are many states in which the peculiar legislation mentioned has been success - fully carried through . ''

		What Eight Million Women Want '' is a thick volume describing the various activities of women in social service and reform .

		It is chiefly concerned with
America	LOCATION	, but also dis - cusses events in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Covering so large a field , it is probably inaccurate in some minor details , taking perhaps a too roseate view of the work of some individuals .

		It is , however , very well written and extremely interesting , and undoubtedly presents a substantially correct picture of the labors of the '' new woman '' and a just interpretation of her spirit .

		It shouJd be read by those who are interested in the suf - fragette movement , because it shows well that women do not want the vote for nothing , but have a practical and important programme .

		It should also be read by those who have been indifferent to the movement , because it brings out so well the need for women in the adminis - tration of social affairs .

		Mr.
E. A. Hecker	PERSON	's `` Short History of Women 's Rights '' might perhaps better be

		THE DIAL 47 described as a history of women 's wrongs .

		Il gives a condensed account of the legal status of women , from the time of the Romans to to-day , with a very useful summary of the present condition of affairs in each state of the
Union	LOCATION	.

		It is essentially a work of reference .

		Some of the figures relating to the occupations of women are curious , if accurate .

		Thus , there are said to be 196 female saloon-keepers in
Illinois	LOCATION	, 208 in
New Jersey	LOCATION	, but only 27 in
Indiana	LOCATION	and 8 in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Thirty-eight women are professors in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, 31 in
Illinois	LOCATION	, but only 4 in
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		In the
State of New York	ORGANIZATION	are 511 women in the ministry , 108 dentists , 103 commercial travel - lers , and 84 carpenters .

		Unfortunately the number of teachers , aside from professors , is not given .

		Miss
Evelyn Sharp	PERSON	's '' Rebel Women '' is a small book consisting of journalistic sketches , many of them previously published in the English papers .

		It is worth while to quote the description of a scene in a
London	LOCATION	police court . ''

		I suppose the offenders knew beforehand what they were charged with an advantage they sometimes had over the magistrate when he mixed up the charge sheets ... One thing could be clearly deduced from the progress of that heart-breaking procession of human failures , as they passed , generally in hopeless silence , from the greyness of the police court to the more com - plete greyness beyond .

		They were all people who had snatched desperately at the air for some of the color of life , and had succumbed helplessly before they found it . ''

		No court of justice could help them .

		You could not expect a magistrate , faced with something like forty cases , to stop and consider the terrible monotony of existence that had driven the little scullery-maid to be ' drunk and disorderly , ' or the poor clerk to steal his employer 's money , thinking to steal his happiness with it ; or the lad with the jolly fearless face to beg in the streets because he was ` out of work ' at fifteen !

		... The magistrate was not unkind ; nobody was unkind .

		All the prisoners were scrupulously asked if they had anything to say , if they would like to call a witness .

		Anything to say !

		You might as well try to discharge a mountain torrent through a bath tap .

		As for witnesses , a bewildered woman , convicted of drunkenness because she had been found lying unconscious on the pavement , could not be expected under the circumstances to have secured a witness to prove her contention that she was merely faint .

		One by one , they all shook their heads mutely , and went away to prison while the sun shone . ''

		Then the remand prisoners , the women who had thronged the doorstep in the
early morning	TIME	, who were there to answer for their rebellious manner of demand - ing a human and a political right , were brought into the dock by ones and twos ; and there crept a change , a subtle change , into the musty atmosphere of ages .

		The court was still bathed in its queer half light .

		There was the same feeling in it of spectral unreality .

		You knew even more certainly than before that the machinery of the little judgment hall was entirely inadequate to deal with the prisoners in the dock .

		But the hopelessness of the whole thing was gone .

		These were not people whose spirit had been driven out of them by monotony and bad luck , as it had been driven out of the derelicts who stood in the dock before them .

		These were not people who were going to give in before they had won from life what they demanded from it .

		It may be a perilous business to hunt down the color of life for other people ; but it is a less hopeless kind of job than hunting it down for yourself ... '' ' Have you anything to say ? '

		came the regulation enquiry , hallowed by centuries of official belief in the innocence of unconvicted prisoners who yet felt their cases to be prejudiced .

		Then , as the woman in the dock showed every indication of having a great deal to say , this would be followed up with a hasty , ` Yes , yes ; but I have nothing to do with that ; I am here to ad - minister the law as it stands . '

		`` So the law was administered as it stood ; and the color of life still flickered elusive beyond the grasp of all of us , as thirteen more offenders , a rebel woman every one of them , went away to prison while the sun shone . ''

		Dr.
Coit	PERSON	's '' Woman in Church and State '' is a sixpenny pamphlet issued by the
West London Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		It calls for no extended notice , but the following criticism of the English suffragette movement is worth citing . ''

		If , then , the sex disabilities other than disf ranchise - ment were pushed to the front , the why ' for granting votes would be thrust into the wits and wills of men .

		The only sex disability which is not a direct cause of suffering to women and to the community is the lack of the vote ; it , therefore , is the only wrong done to women which does not immediately arouse sympathy and the resentment of righteous indignation .

		On the other hand , the effort to remove those disabilities which are immediate causes of suffering would excite sympathetic indignation , and , even if it failed to change the laws , would win over the social conscience to the suffrage cause . ''

		More than this , it ought to be clearly shown that the women who are agitating for the suf - frage have general social interests in view , and in this particular it seems that the women of
America	LOCATION	have some advantage over those of
England	LOCATION	, who at times remind outsiders of the celebrated definition of a populist as `` a man who does not know what he wants , but wants it damned bad . ''

		Closer acquaintance with the movement will of course dispel any such idea ; but inasmuch as the vote is not in itself an nd , it would be well to bring home to all what the ends to be attained really are .

		After all , when women have the vote , what will be the result ?

		It is not to be supposed ; hat the disability of ages can be removed all at once , and if it is true that eight million women want important reforms , there are other millions who are variously incompetent to direct jublic affairs .

		The same , however , is true of 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, men , even after so many years of political free - dom .

		Here in
Colorado	LOCATION	, where I write , women have long had legal equality with men , and nevertheless our state politics are notoriously corrupt , and our politicians , broadly speaking , extraordinarily incompetent .

		No disaster has resulted from women 's suffrage , no injury to women , but as a rule they have not proved much better than the men .

		That is really the worst that can be said of them .

		On the other hand , in particular cases , the women have really saved the day for decency .

		During the last year there have been two hotly contested elec - tions in
Boulder	LOCATION	, where I live ; one on the question of keeping out the saloons , the other on good vs. cheap schools .

		In each case I believe there is no possible doubt that the issue of the election depended on the women ; and in view of the fact that this is the seat of a rapidly growing
State University	ORGANIZATION	, the results of female suffrage are here of more than local , of even more than
State	ORGANIZATION	, importance .

		He had from his youth a strong leaning toward letters , but resisted it until he was more than fifty years old , in order that he might give his undivided attention to his chosen profession of medicine .

		these are books of fiction , the latest of them being entitled ''
John Sherwood	PERSON	, Ironmaster . ''

		This wise and sober novel takes the form of an autobiography .

		Less than fifty pages suffice to relate the story of
John Sherwood	PERSON	's boyhood and early life , up to the time when he has become the master of a great industry , but at the cost of a wrecked constitution .

		This is the introduction to the real story , which begins with his middle life , when he abandons the world of affairs and goes into camp on the coast of
Maine	LOCATION	in the hope of repairing his nervous waste and regaining the vitality that he has lost .

		The experiment proves successful , as we should naturally expect ; for the author has seen it worked out in the cases of countless patients for whom he has prescribed it , and has no need to resort to invention in his description of the regenerative process .

		And with the renewal of his health , this fictive patient gains other things for which he had not bargained a broader outlook upon life , a deepened sympathy with his fellow-man , and a knowledge of the mean - ing of a man 's love for a woman .

		Both the physi - cal cure and the spiritual enlargement are wrought within a year 's space ; but when we then take leave of
John Sherwood	PERSON	we are assured , however he may pass his remaining days , that they will be rich in the true values of life .

		There is an impressive moral in this story , and it is all the more effective for not being forced .

		The book is not one for the seeker after entertainment or sensation , but for the reader of refined intelligence who asks for nothing more startling than real characterization , the artistic touch in description , and the philosophical temper in narration .

		All these he will find in ample measure and variety , together with enough of a plot to cement them into a substantial whole .

		Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	's '' The Price '' may be de - scribed as an inverted detective story , in which the criminal is the hero , and the detective is outwitted in his attempt at capture .

		This programme requires that we shall in a measure condone the offence and rejoice when the offender gives his pursuer the slip .

		It is an ethically questionable attitude that we are thus forced to assume , but the conditions are neces - sary to the enjoyment of the story .


Kenneth Griswold	PERSON	, an athlete and a man of parts , finds himself stranded in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Here is an initial improbability , for it is a good deal of a strain to imagine that such a man can be thus reduced to absolute penury .

		He is a would-be novelist with a message ; his novel does not find acceptance with the publishers , and his message may be loosely de - fined as that of socialism .

		He thinks he is per - suaded that the '' have-nots '' may legitimately prey upon the '' haves '' ; and , finding himself without the price of a meal , he '' holds up '' a bank presi - dent for a hundred thousand dollars .

		The coup is brilliantly executed , and he escapes with his plun - der , taking the disguise of a roustabout on a Mis - sissippi steamer .

		His plan is to go to some strange town of moderate size , and apply his ill-gotten wealth to the establishment of some sort of indus -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 trial utopia in which the ancient quarrel between labor and capital shall be made to lose its mean - ing .

		After a series of narrow escapes , he makes his way safely to
Wahaska	LOCATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	, and be - comes a welcome addition to the life of that com - munity .

		There are two young women in the case , both of whom become possessed of his secret , but do not betray him the one from fear of personal notoriety , and the other from a belief in
Griswold	LOCATION	's essential integrity .

		He thinks he loves the former , until he discovers how mean a motive has sealed her lips and made her his ally ; he really comes to love the latter when he realizes her unfailing sympathy and the resourcefulness with which she baffles his pursuers .

		For the detective is all the time close on his track , and has a morally clear case , although unable to secure the legal evidence which would warrant an arrest .

		In the end , con - science does what the machinery of the law has failed to do ; he gives himself up , takes his medi - cine , and emerges from his two years ' imprisonment to marry the woman who has befriended him and at the same time aroused his better nature .

		The whole story is crisply told and ingeniously put together , making one of the most excitingly read - able novels of the season .

		Mr.
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	, who is , we believe , a Southern journalist , is the author of a surprisingly good novel entitled `` Queed . ''

		Before this novel was put upon the market , its publishers sought to create interest in its appearance by inviting opin - ions concerning the kind of character that a man named Queed would be likely to have .

		The opinions offered were ingenious and varied , but they seem so have been wide of the mark .

		Now that the book is at hand , we will hazard a guess that the author named his hero after the familiar
Q. E. D.	PERSON	of mathematics , adding only enough letters to make a '' spellable '' word .

		For Queed , when we make his acquaintance , is a man who lives by logic , and has no place for sentiment in his composition . ''

		He was a machine ; a machine which turned out match - less work for the enlightenment of the world , but after all a machine .

		He was intellect .

		He was Pure Reason . ''

		These are the terms in which he puts it to himself , after he has come to realize his limitations .

		His story is that of the transformation of a machine into a human being , which process is gradually worked out as Queed is forced into con - tact with life , and discovers that there is in him something which is personally concerned with the world of men and women .

		One woman in partic - ular the very charming heroine is the most active agent in this evolution , and the humorous possibilities of the case may be well illustrated by a quotation . ''

		And are you coining to see me to pay your party-call ? '' ''

		Why should I ?

		What is the point of these conventions these little rules ? '' ''

		Do n't you like being with me .

		Do n't you get a great deal of pleasure from my society ? '' ''

		I have never asked myself such a question . ''

		He was gazing at her for a third time , and a startled look sprang suddenly into his eyes .

		It was plain that he was asking himself such a question now .

		A curious change passed over his face ; a kind of dawning consciousness which , it was obvious , embarrassed him to the point of torture , while he resolutely declined to flinch from it . ''

		Yes I get pleasure from your society . ''

		The admission turned him rather white , but he saved himself by instantly flinging at her : '' However , J am no hedonist . ''

		Sharlee retired to look up hedonist in the dictionary .

		The humanizing process has gone fairly far by the time this episode occurs , and the
spring	DATE	freshets are clearly preparing .

		There are still difficulties to be overcome a rival possessed of all the social graces which Queed has not ; and a dark secret which would seem to set an impossible barrier between
Sharlee	PERSON	and himself .

		But the rival turns out to be a doll stuffed with sawdust ; and as for the barrier , the girl simply laughs at it .

		We will say nothing more of the plot of this thoroughly delightful story , hoping that enough has been sug - gested to whet the appetite .

		The scene is a South - ern city presumably
Richmond	LOCATION	; and the time is that in which we live .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's journalistic training stands him in good stead .

		He has the journalist 's sense for the striking arrangement of material and the telling point ; he has , too , the jour - nalist 's instinct for avoiding long-winded digressions and descriptions .

		He knows the ins and outs of his profession , and the tricks of the wily politician .

		He also touches lightly but effectively upon the ways of the small college and the joys of its ad - ministration .

		His characterizations are unusually effective , and he quietly works his story up from rather tame beginnings to the startling dramatic complications of its climax .

		He has an admirable style , brilliantly alive , and rich in the sort of allusive - ness that comes naturally to the cultivated mind .

		He has given us , in a word , a book so conscientiously done and at the same time so enjoyable that we find it difficult to set forth the degree and quality of the satisfaction with which we have read it .

		The author of ''
Routledge	PERSON	Rides Alone '' has given us , in '' She
Buildeth Her House	ORGANIZATION	, '' his second large novel ; and we regret to say that it is not as good a book as the first had led us to expect .

		It has a less vital and interesting theme , for one thing ; and for another , it is marred by dabblings with occultism a handicap which few novelists have ever been able to overcome .

		It is really too much to ask any sensible person to take seriously such a monster as
Bellingham	LOCATION	, who lectures upon '' new thought '' to audiences of silly women , and who hypnotizes those whom he has marked for his victims to such an extent that , struggle as they may , they must succumb to his fascinations .

		All this talk about luring people from a distance by '' concentration '' is the sheerest nonsense ; and the author knows it as well as anyone else .

		Mr. Com - fort 's heroine just escapes final disaster through the counter-attraction of another strong personality , who also acts from a distance .

		In the latter case , however , the influence is exerted through actual 50 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, correspondence , which puts it on a rational basis .

		This man , who is the real hero , is a reformed rake , with a past which is outlined in such terms as to make his present at least improbable .

		Three weeks in a sanatorium are not likely to transform vice into virtue , or re-create a wrecked will .

		But if we overlook the miracle of his regeneration , he makes a fairly interesting hero .

		Paula -LRB- the heroine -RRB- is a literary critic , and a book by Charters -LRB- the hero -RRB- so attracts her that she writes him a personal letter about it .

		This is the beginning of a bond which ends to use the flamboyant words of the publisher 's announcement in '' the glorious Union of Two to form One . ''

		The malign influence of
Bellingham	LOCATION	becomes weakened as the spiritual in - fluence of Charters grows stronger , and the `` glorious Union '' above mentioned is consummated amid the fiery volcanic outpourings of the Mont Pele'e .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	's style seems to have developed in the wrong direction toward strain and artificiality rather than to ward clearness and sincerity ; and even his story-telling faculty is much at fault until near the end , when he pulls himself together , and gives us some really dramatic situations . ''

		In Her Own Right '' is the latest of Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	's agreeable novels of
Maryland	LOCATION	society .

		Having already startled us by bringing real pirates into a story of comparatively modern life , he takes pirate gold for his present motive , and makes the fortunes of his hero turn upon the recovery of a buried treasure on the shores of
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	.

		This is a lucky happening , because the hero , who has lost his own wealth in a business failure , would never have found courage to woo the heiress whom he loves had not another fortune thus opportunely come to his hand .

		As it is , the heiress has to meet him more than half way , which we imagine is the explanation of the title given to the book .

		Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	, after bidding us soar aloft with his '' Skyman , '' brings us back to solid earth with his automobile romance of `` The Girl in the Other Seat . ''

		His hero is a famous racer , who is also the inventor of a new explosive device , and his heroine is a young woman whose acquaintance he makes one dark night on a country road , when she stops his machine and asks for a `` lift . ''

		He can not see her face , but her voice is enough to bowl him over , and the rest of the story tells how he establishes her identity and wins her for his own .

		A plot to steal his invention keeps the story going for a time , and supplements its sentimental interest , while the description of an exciting race supplies a whirlwind finish .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	, as usual '' gets up '' his technical material very thoroughly , and developes his story in neat and logical fashion .

		A plot for the capture of
Richmond	LOCATION	in
1863	DATE	, by a carefully concerted uprising and general delivery of
Union	ORGANIZATION	prisoners in the Confederate capital , is the subject of `` The Vintage , '' a spirited and swiftly-moving novel by Mr.
Joseph Sharts	PERSON	.

		The hero is a Union spy of great resourcefulness in both disguise and conspiracy , who is known by the au - thorities to be at work in the city , but eludes all attempts at capture .

		He finally gives himself up to save from execution a young Confederate officer unjustly condemned for supposed treason this being done for the sake of the beaux yeux of the officer 's sister .

		He is shrewd enough , however , to exact from President
Davis	PERSON	a pledge of immunity , having read the chivalrous character of the Presi - dent well enough to know that the pledge will be held sacred .

		He escapes in the end , although circumstances have taken his fate beyond the President 's control ; and the plot of course collapses , as we have all along known that it must .

		A very picturesque and striking figure in the narrative is that of the gloomy and fanatical chief of the Con - federate secret service , who follows relentlessly on the hero 's track , but is finally baffled of his prey .

		The story presents a vivid picture of life in Rich - mond during the anxious latter period of the war , and is thoroughly interesting .

		Another story of the Civil War is `` Love under Fire , '' from the practiced pen of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	.

		The action in this case covers only a few days of plot and counterplot , espial , capture , fighting , and escape , all in and about a country plantation .

		But the time is sufficient to knit two souls , and provide for all the romantic needs of the situation .

		The hero is a
Union	LOCATION	soldier sent to spy out the land and report upon the enemy 's operations ; the heroine is a Southern girl of the proud and pas - sionate type that readers of this species of romance know well .

		There are the usual misunderstand - ings , and there is the expected reconciliation .

		Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	has done this sort of thing several times before ; he has only to give the kaleidoscope a turn , and it is ready to be done again .

		Far more serious than either of the Civil War stories just mentioned is Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's `` The Long Roll . ''

		Its seriousness is such as to defeat its purpose as a work of imaginative art , and its extraordinary merits are of a kind that do not properly belong to fiction at all .

		In the introduc - tory note we are told that '' to name the historians , biographers , memoir and narrative writers , diarists , and contributors of but a vivid page or two to the magazines of historical societies , to whom the writer of a story dealing with this period is indebted , would be to place below a very long list . ''

		One does not have to read very far to become convinced of the truth thus modestly stated , and to realize the amazing industry that has gone to the piecing of this mosaic .

		Nor does one read very far before realizing also that the work is anything but a novel in the ordinary sense .

		It is a military history , a series of descriptions of marches , skirmishes , and battles , a collection of incisive characterizations of military leaders , a passionate defence of the right - eousness of the Southern cause , but it is devoid of the constructive art which might have made all these matters the accessories of a logically devel - oped dramatic action , and used them to heighten

		THE DIAJL 51 our interest in the private figures of the writer 's invention .

		Here are upwards of a quarter of a million words , and nine-tenths of them are superflu - ous as far as the requirements of the novelist proper are concerned .

		We have , to be sure , a hero , a heroine , and a villain , besides a number of figures of minor interest ; but they are held in such dilution that the plot loses all continuity , and the figures themselves become shadowy apparitions that flit in and out from time to time .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's real hero is , of course ,
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	, whom she de - lineates with great particularity of detail .

		Whether the figure that she draws , of a grim and fanatical martinet , self-centred and inexorable , is the real
Jackson	PERSON	or not , may be a matter of dispute ; but there can be no doubt that the figure is one of real vitality and distinction .

		When he utters his last dreamy words , '' Let us pass over the river , and rest under the shade of the trees , '' the book is ended , and all the private interests with which a novel should nat - urally be concerned are left at loose ends .

		Perhaps Miss
Johnston	PERSON	intends to give us a sequel , and thus to meet more fully the romantic demands of her theme .

		The other woman of
Virginia	LOCATION	who has won a high place as a novelist during the last few years is Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	, and her `` Miller of Old Church '' is a work that shows no signs of slack - ening power .

		It is a real novel , thereby standing in sharp contrast to '' The Long Roll , '' and is less affected by a social or political interest than its predecessors .

		It is true that the hero is repre - sented as an embodiment of the new type of energy that is overcoming the long paralysis of Southern industry , and that he figures as a radical speaker at public meetings , but it is chiefly as an individual that he interests us alternately attracting and repel - ling and it is his love affair with the flirtatious
Molly	PERSON	that provides the substance of the plot .

		All is not lost , even when he thinks he has given her up for good , and marries the virtuous and homely
Judy	PERSON	; for in due course of time his wife dies , and
Molly	PERSON	, having had her fling -LRB- or several of them -RRB- , comes back to nestle in his arms .

		A secondary plot is furnished by the recent marriage of the young squire with the miller 's sister ; and a rather unnec - essary touch of tragedy , when the squire is shot by the miller 's brother , who does not know of the marriage , brings the story to a close .

		A great many pages of the book are filled with rustic talk , of the kind that is both shrewd and quaint , clearly studied from the life , but rather wearisome in more than limited doses .

		Most of it may be skipped without any loss to the story .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In '' The Evolution of Literature '' The Evolution / / i 11 i > / - \ T of Literature .

		-LRB-
Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Professor
A. S. Mackenzie	PERSON	presents a book which , according to the words of the publishers ' announce - ment , `` affords an intelligible view of what is usually termed Comparative Literature , an adequate manual of which has , until now , been lacking . ''

		Neither history nor archaeology nor philology suffices in our study of literature , says the author , and sub - jective criticism is not always a satisfactory guide ; and therefore he proposes a departure from the beaten pathway of investigation , to consist in the treatment of literature as a subdivision of anthro - pology .

		His plan is to divide social development into four grades primitive , barbaric , autocratic , and democratic ; to consider the various forms of literature the dance and drama , the lyric , the narrative as they appear in each grade ; to detect in each grade the universal elements ; to demon - strate the evolution of each form in its progress from the first grade to the last ; and from the whole to formulate laws of literary evolution .

		That Professor
Mackenzie	PERSON	's book does not arouse enthusiasm is due in part to difficulties inherent in the subject , and in part to defects of presentation .

		Those who read it with the expectation of seeing clearly traced a series of definite steps in literary evolution will be disappointed .

		Not all the riddles of literature are to be solved by even so orderly and scientific a method as the one employed here .

		Readers will be disappointed , too , and probably amused , at the three '' Provisional Laws '' in the concluding chapter , each elaborately explained in a half-dozen very serious pages , and at the end translated into actual formulae .

		The `` Law of Progress '' is thus expressed : `` Under similar conditions the average literary advance in a given community is directly proportional to the width and depth of man 's attainment of consciousness of self and of the world '' ; and the '' Law of Respon - siveness '' thus : '' Other things being equal , literary form and content vary directly with the orientation of mental responsiveness in a given community . ''

		This comes dangerously near putting one in mind of a current definition of one of the more recent '' sciences '' which infest the college curriculum '' the science of stating what everybody knows in language which nobody can understand . ''

		The book claims too much .

		There may be such a thing as literary evolution , and there may be laws which underlie it ; but the attempt to biologize literature , to say nothing of reducing its laws of growth to algebraic formulae , is bound to savor of the ludicrous .

		As to presentation , the author 's success would have been more pronounced had he written a shorter book and encumbered his theme less by masses of detail which are not always strictly relevant , how - ever true and interesting in themselves .

		In spite of the excellent plan of the work , its plethora of detail brings it near to incoherence .

		Professor 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
Mackenzie	PERSON	's industry and learning may be estimated from the fact that the index of authors at the end of his 417 closely-printed pages of text contains about 700 names .

		Those who wish a book full of interesting learning about literature from the anthropological point of view will therefore find this a desirable work .

		Florentine Interesting mainly to the student yesterdays and the antiquarian , and yet suffi - and todays .

		ciently picturesque to attract the average reader , is the Rev.
J. Wood Brown	PERSON	's `` Florence Past and Present '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		His '' Past '' of
Florence	LOCATION	is a very distant one indeed , and goes back to the first contributions of geology and physics to the long history the volcanic upheaval which lifted the whole inner hill-country of
Tuscany	LOCATION	to its present level and created the new drainage - lines now existing .

		The gravel and sand that the flowing waters then brought down and deposited furnished the site on which the city of
Florence	LOCATION	stands to-day .

		The middle Val d'Arno , when man first saw it , was all woods and water .

		To the early inhabitants , hunting and fishing were the only pos - sible occupations .

		To this fact that the earliest ancestors of the modern Florentine were hunters and fishers the author traces a large number of Florentine characteristics .

		For example , their economy at table is proverbial , their temperance in food and drink amounts to parsimony .

		This began when the uncertainty of the chase taught the hunter self-restraint in the use of food , and the methods of living on nut-meal till fortune should meet him again in the wood or the river .

		In like manner , the pet superstitions to-day are distinct survivals of the magic of the woods , derived from the hunter 's skill .

		In time , of course , these forest-dwellers come in friendly relation with the farmers of the north and the shepherds of the south ; hence trade begins , roads are made , and by the combination of road and river the seat of
Florence	LOCATION	is determined and her prosperity assured .

		This tale is charmingly un - folded in the first division of the book called '' The Living Past , '' which ends with the decline of Etruscan and the rise of Roman power , and the recognition of
Florence	LOCATION	as a municipium splendid - issimum in 82
B.C.	LOCATION	.

		The second division discusses '' Material Survivals , '' and takes up such familiar sights as the Arno boats and boatmeci , the Florentine carts , harness , amulets all pointing to a woodland past .

		In the third division we have '' The Feasts . ''

		To the average foreigner nothing seems more absurd than the customs of the numerous '' festas '' of the Italian people , especially the Ceppo and
Befana	LOCATION	, the crickets captured and carried home in little cages on Ascension Day , the feast of lanterns on the seventh of
September	DATE	.

		But when these are traced , as they are here , to ancient myths , when these strange rites are shown to have a general line of inheritance from customs natural to men of the woods , and receiving from them a magical interpre - tation , then the noise and masking , the dances and bean-eating , even the procession of the black rag-doll through the streets , become more intelligible .

		The sixty fine and unusual photographs , mostly the author 's own , with his three maps , are delightful accessories to a volume dealing with new material about
Italy	LOCATION	in a convincing and charming way .

		Sir
Perceval	ORGANIZATION	, * n our ear ^ er literary history there Knight of the is no problem that possesses greater Holy Grail .

		fascination than the origin and growth of the
Arthur	PERSON	story .

		This problem involves numerous lesser problems , among them that of the provenance of the various legends of
Sir Perceval	ORGANIZATION	, original knight of the Holy Grail .

		The most note - worthy of these legends are the '' Conte du Graal '' of Chretien de Troies , the '' Parzival '' of
Wolfram von Eschenbach	PERSON	-LRB- on which
Wagner	PERSON	drew -RRB- , and '' Sir Percyvelle of Galles '' a Middle English poem of unknown authorship .

		One of these , the '' Parzival , '' was apparently based in part on Chretien .

		Mystery surrounds the origin of the other two , though it has been contended by some scholars that the English poem also had its origin in
Chretien	LOCATION	.

		That this view is untenable is pretty conclusively shown by Prof.
R. H. Griffith	PERSON	in his '' Sir Perceval of
Galles	PERSON	, '' a volume recently issued from the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Griffith	PERSON	also advances certain alternative theories , theories that are quite ingenious and not unplausi - ble .

		He holds that the English '' Perceval '' prob - ably had its beginning in a '' frame-tale , '' like that binding together the '' Canterbury Tales '' or '' The Decameron , '' and that there were incorporated into it at different times at least two other tales or episodes of independent origin .

		The home of the original story , he holds , was probably
Northwest England	LOCATION	, perhaps in the neighborhood of
Carlisle	LOCATION	or of Chester .

		The volume is essentially technical in nature , but it is by no means devoid of the graces of style , and is concerned with processes that must prove interesting to the student of general folk-lore as well as to the specialist in Arthurian legend .

		In all that has been written about clubs , there is probably no book that , besides possessing many other excellent features , gives so much attention to the relics and collections , the art objects and the libraries , of these numerous and famous societies as does Mr.
Ralph Nevill	PERSON	's handsome octavo entitled ''
London	LOCATION	Clubs : Their History and Treasures '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		From the Mermaid , supposed to have been founded by
Raleigh	LOCATION	, down to the Athenaeum , the Savile , the
Royal Thames Yacht Club	ORGANIZATION	, and countless others , the author pleasantly conducts his readers , enlivening the journey with a number of appropriate illustrations from more or less ancient sources , and offering still further diversion in the shape of club anecdotes and witticisms . ''

		The evolu - tion of the modern club , '' he explains at the outset , '' has been so simple that it can be traced with great ease .

		THE DIAL 53 certain number of people met on special evenings for purposes of social conversation , and incidentally consumed a good deal of liquid refreshment ; then the beginning of the club proper some well - known house of refreshment being taken over from the proprietor by a limited number of clients for their own exclusive use , and the landlord retained as manager ; and finally the palatial modern club , not necessarily sociable , but replete with every comfort , and owned by the members themselves .

		In such places , however , the old spirit of club-life is generally lost . ''

		Among the most famous of the old taverns used for club purposes was the
Cheshire Cheese	ORGANIZATION	, whose lineal descendant is still standing , with its legendary '' Favourite Seat of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	'' in the dining-room .

		Our historic
Cheshire Cheese	ORGANIZATION	, the dairy product of huge dimensions sent from
Cheshire	LOCATION	in the
Berkshire	LOCATION	hills to President
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, is of course not even distantly related to the
London	LOCATION	''
Cheshire Cheese	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But things American do receive some attention from Mr.
Nevill	PERSON	, in that he devotes a little space in his con - cluding chapter to the Players ' Club and the Lambs in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Of the club libraries mentioned or described by the author , the library of the Ath - enaeum Club , the finest and most complete of such collections , merits even more extended notice than it receives .

		Here again a word of reminder may prevent a possible confusion , in any quarter , of the
London	LOCATION	Athenaeum library and the still more im - portant
Boston Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	collection of literary treasures .

		For illustrative anecdote and many im - portant items of information , Mr.
Nevill	PERSON	has drawn freely and effectively upon
Boswell	PERSON	's biography of the most clubable character in history .

		Indeed , there is no lack of material from which to compile such a book as that now produced , and the author has not failed to turn it to good account .

		Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	, the brilliant Italian opera * and authoritative music critic of the
New York	LOCATION	Sun , has published a little book entitled '' Some Forerunners of Italian Opera -LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is little in name and size only .

		It is a learned and acute study of the early lyric drama in
Italy	LOCATION	as the principal element of the revival of the theatre in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		After a brief description of the liturgical drama of the Middle Ages the author discusses the special form of sacred dramatic dialogue known as Lauds or Divozioni , in which scenes from the Passion were presented .

		These were acted in church , with a specially - constructed stage built against the choir screen , and with properties and costumes resembling those of the miracle-plays in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		Then came the
Sacre Rappresentazioni	ORGANIZATION	which , towards the close of the fifteenth century , adapted their apparatus to the dramatization of secular stories , paving the way for the secular lyric drama .

		It was at
Mantua	LOCATION	, probably about
1483	DATE	, that the significant step was taken which laid the foundations of opera , by the performance of
Poliziano	ORGANIZATION	's `` Orfeo , '' given in celebration of the return of the
Cardinal Gonzaga	ORGANIZATION	.

		This important event is treated by Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	in considerable detail .

		The Orpheus myth made a strong appeal to the Italian poets and scholars of Medicean times , and
Poliziano	ORGANIZATION	's treatment of it was only one though the best of several .

		The grace and fine poetic feeling of the text were probably greatly enhanced by the music , which Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	believes to have been derived from the frottola or popular part-songs of the day , the '' plebeian parent '' of the later mad - rigal ; and even the solo parts seem to have con - sisted of this better frottola type , and to have been accompanied by the singer himself upon an instrument of the lyre class .

		The orchestra is a more difficult question ; but '' while no conclusive evidence can be produced that one was employed in the ` Orfeo , ' the indications are strong that there was one . ''

		This simple and dignified `` frottola drama '' was followed by the sensuous madrigal drama of the sixteenth century , whose spectacular quality was its principal feature , accompanied also by a decided increase of the comic element .

		The great reform which provided a medium for indi - vidual utterance was the introduction of dramatic recitative , and was the work of a little circle of
Florentines	LOCATION	, the most famous of whom were
Peri	PERSON	and
Caccini	PERSON	, who '' found the link that was missing in the musical chain of Poliziano 's ' Orfeo , ' rein - carnated
Italy	LOCATION	's
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	prophet , and built the gates through which
Monteverde	ORGANIZATION	ushered lyric composition to the broad highway of modern opera . ''

		In bringing his readers to this point , Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son 's task is accomplished ; the development of opera proper is another story .

		He has written clearly and persuasively of somewhat obscure and difficult matters ; and his book will be indispensable to all students of the history of lyric drama .

		A volume of Jt .

		is with delight _ a calm and well-reasoned rational delight that the reflective timely essays .

		rea der makes his way through Pro- fessor
John Grier Hibben	PERSON	's little book , '' A
Defence of Prejudice	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Essays '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Pre - judice , as our anthor broadly defines it , is a judg - ment to which one gives assent , but which one can not prove ; and he proceeds to illustrate the three common kinds into which prejudices may be divided , showing in the end how much of conduct and character is based , and often well based , on these unprovable judgments .

		The next paper is called `` The Philosophy of Opposition , '' and con - vincingly demonstrates the necessary part played by obstacles in all progress , but at the same time shows how the struggle to overcome may be and ought to be a generous and altruistic , not a selfish and ignoble , strife .

		Another essay , '' The Gospel of Might , '' contains something of the same thought in another form , and assails
Nietzsche	PERSON	and his glorification of strength .

		`` Any philosophy of life , '' concludes the essayist , '' is under suspicion which seeks to destroy and not fulfil the promise of the 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, years that are gone , and which does not build upon the foundation of human nature as it has proved itself to be , but rather upon that which with wild fatuity we may wish it to become . ''

		Other excel - lent chapters have to do with personal responsibility , the dialectic imagination , the scholar 's vocation , the art of thinking , the so-called superfluous in education , and similar pregnant topics .

		In an essay on `` The Paradox of Research , '' as also in that entitled `` The Superfluous in Education , '' the writer shows how self-defeating are all plans for eliminating the '' useless '' from courses of educa - tion ; `` a man always needs more than he uses .

		He who can do but one thing never does it supremely well .

		An excess of power is an essential and sig - nificant factor in efficiency . ''

		From the calamitous crash ,
four years ago	DATE	, of the great cantilever bridge across the
St. Lawrence River	LOCATION	at
Quebec	LOCATION	, the author very ably , and with timely exhibition of some '' excess of power '' on his own part in the field of mechanics , draws a moral , which furnishes the substance of his concluding chapter entitled '' Secondary Strains . ''

		Thoroughly wholesome and stimulating are Dr.
Hibben	PERSON	's appeals to the under - standing and to the heart of his readers .

		But one is a little surprised , in turning his pages , to find so practised a dialectician disregarding -LRB- as he does on page nine -RRB- the distinction between '' shall '' and '' will . ''

		He is also guilty of using '' illy '' for '' ill '' -LRB- p. 123 -RRB- .

		The world has already heard a good deal about Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's inter - rupted cruise , in which he was to have followed the sun in a small boat through the entire three hundred and sixty degrees , but was arrested in
Australia	LOCATION	by a baffling ailment that no physician could even name , and that he had to puzzle out for himself , with the aid of Lieutenant
Woodruff	PERSON	's book on the disastrous effects of tropi - cal light on white skins .

		Now we have the full account of those
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	wanderings , in a handsome and well-illustrated volume entitled `` The Cruise of the Snark '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author takes occasion in his '' Backword '' to correct some popular misapprehensions .

		He says : '' The voyage was our idea of a good time .

		I built the Snark , and paid for it , and for all expenses .

		I contracted to write thirty-five thousand words de - scriptive of the trip for a magazine which was to pay me the same rate I received for stories written at home .

		Promptly the magazine advertised that it was sending me especially around the world for itself .

		It was a wealthy magazine .

		And every man who had business dealings with the Snark charged three prices , because , forsooth , the maga - zine could afford it .

		Down in the uttermost
South Sea	LOCATION	isle this myth obtained , and I paid accordingly .

		To this day everybody believes that the magazine paid for everything and that I made a fortune out of the voyage . ''

		It was not treasure of that sort that the daring navigator was in quest of ; he un - dertook the voyage just `` for the fun of it . ''

		That the tale is well told , follows almost as a matter of course from its authorship .

		There is abundance of sufficiently unusual adventure in it , and pictures from the voyager 's camera are lavishly supplied .

		A colored plate , showing the taut little craft , that served its builder so stanchly and well , faces the title-page .

		That Captain
Kidd	PERSON	was not , after all , a pirate , but was instead a thor - oughly loyal and law-abiding subject of the Crown , is the view proposed and vigorously defended by Sir
Cornelius Neale Dalton	PERSON	in his vol - ume entitled '' The Real Captain Kidd '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This prince of pirates according to popular tradi - tion was in reality , so we are now assured , merely the victim of circumstances and the tool of un - scrupulous employers who sought to use him as a scapegoat for crimes of their own committing .

		The only ostensible act of piracy of which the author finds any difficulty in acquitting
Kidd	PERSON	is his board - ing and plundering a Portuguese ship near Malabar in
1698	DATE	; and even in this case it is urged that
Kidd	PERSON	was probably either driven to the deed by his crew or was actuated by a desire to avenge in some measure a recent unprovoked attack on his own ship by a Portuguese man-of-war .

		In an appendix are set forth the principal documents in the case , including the royal commission given
Kidd	PERSON	to sup - press piracy in English waters and on the high seas ,
Kidd	PERSON	's own narrative of his voyages , the depositions of certain of his crew taken for use in his trial , copies of the French passes found on board the two French ships captured by
Kidd	PERSON	-LRB- documents which , it is claimed , would have acquitted him had they not been suppressed by the prosecution -RRB- , and some account of the traditions current in
Kidd	PERSON	's own time as to the immensity of the treasure which he had amassed .

		Nothing is said of '' The Gold-Bug , '' however , or of '' The Devil and
Tom Walker	PERSON	, '' or of any other literary employment of the
Kidd	PERSON	leg - end ; it is held , indeed , that there was no buried treasure .

		Macaulay 's account of
Kidd	PERSON	's life and adventures is described as an `` indefensible and inexcusable travesty '' of the facts .

		A survey of Mr ' Herraan E -
Kittredge	ORGANIZATION	's `` Bio - Col. ingergoll 's graphical Appreciation '' of
Robert	PERSON	life and work .

		Ingersoll appears with the imprint of `` The
Dresden Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		so named , ap - parently , in commemoration of Ingersoll 's birth - place ,
Dresden	LOCATION	,
Yates County	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Kittredge	PERSON	's book is a substantial volume of nearly six hundred pages , devoted chiefly to a chronological examination of Ingersoll 's speeches and writings , with abundant comment and frequent quotation .

		The preparation of the book has evidently been a congenial task , and one can not turn its pages without catching at least a little of the eulogist 's enthusiastic admiration for
Ingersoll	ORGANIZATION	's many fine qualities .

		For those who lack the time or the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI , 55 inclination to acquaint themselves with IngersolFs works , as published in twelve volumes by the
Dresden Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, this comprehensive survey of those works will serve as a trustworthy epitome of their contents .

		The free-thinking orator was so gifted and so effective as a speaker that it would be surprising to find him equally excellent in the printed page .

		His florid style , reinforced by the magnetism of his fine presence , used to delight even his less sympathetic listeners ; but in cold print this exuberant manner rather tends to weariness .

		Therefore it is well to have such a work as Mr.
Kittredge	PERSON	's to convey the substance of
Ingersoll	ORGANIZATION	's thought and argument without excessive amplifica - tion and repetition .

		One of the unique hymn-books of A unique t ^ coun t r y h as Deen f or thirty years hymn-book .

		/ , the '' Unity Hymns and Chorals , prepared by three Unitarian ministers
J. V. Blake	PERSON	,
F. L. Hosmer	PERSON	, and
W. C. Gannett	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its features were the cutting through of the leaves just below the music score , so that any hymn could by turning the lower part of the leaf be brought below any tune ; and the extensive use made of the best ethical American poetry , especially the poems of
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Samuel Longfellow	PERSON	,
Chadwick	PERSON	, and
Hosmer	PERSON	.

		After three years of careful culling and advising , a new edition of the useful book has been prepared by the last-named two of the original editors .

		The paper is better , the print is better , the binding is better ; the number of hymns and the number of tunes has been considerably increased , while a few less appealing ones have been dropped .

		Bound up with the hymns are a number of excel - lent brief services and prayers .

		The many con - gregations that have used this book will be glad of the chance to get the new edition under the fami - liar title .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
Theodore Parker	PERSON	centenary , which was some - what elaborately celebrated in
Chicago	LOCATION
last November	DATE	, provided for a stenographic report of its various meet - ings .

		This report is now printed by the
Unity Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lishing
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, giving us the speeches made at the several gatherings , together with a selection of press notices and other matters of a collateral character .

		We are glad that so worthy an undertaking should have been thus commemorated in an enduring way .

		The
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	has published '' A List of Books on the
History of Science	ORGANIZATION	, '' compiled by Mr.
Aksel G. S. Josephson	PERSON	, head cataloguer of that library , and having reference to the material in the library .

		This is the tenth of the bibliographical publications issued by the institution whose name on the title-page is a guarantee of careful and scholarly work .

		The present list was begun nine years ago , but its completion has been twice postponed for the sake of greater inclu - siveness and to await the aquisition of important works in the department concerned .

		Mr.
Josephson	PERSON	's arrange - ment of titles is topical , and under the several heads there is a further division of a chronological nature .

		The list is not confined to books shelved separately , but a great many monographs printed in serials have been included .

		The compiler declares his work to be the '' first attempt at a record of the literature of the his - tory of science as a whole , which is restricted to works of historical character . ''

		The list contains , we should say , about nineteen hundred titles , and with a twenty - five-page alphabetical index it fills nearly three hundred pages . ''

		The Great English Novelists , '' in two volumes , is the latest addition to the Messrs.
Harpers	PERSON	' '' Reader 's Library . ''

		Messrs.
W. J. and C. W. Dawson	PERSON	are the editors of these volumes , each of which has an intro - ductory essay one on '' The Growth and Technique of the English Novel , '' the other on '' The Masters of the Modern Novel . ''

		Since fiction can be illustrated only by means of selected passages in such a work as this , the editors have grouped their chosen chapters or episodes under six heads : Love scenes , historic person - ages , epics of conflict , humor , high-water mark , and children in fiction .

		A dozen or more selections are given in each of these sections , and the total result is a reading-book of great interest and variety of content .

		A few years ago , Mr.
C. R. L. Fletcher	PERSON	wrote an '' Introductory History of
England	LOCATION	'' in four volumes , in which the story of
England	LOCATION	is told from the earliest times to
1815	DATE	.

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's history is of a very unusual type , one that attempts to conceal neither predilections nor prejudices ; and the author has been much criticized by reviewers for his partisan spirit , his flippant and slangy English , and his unconventional style .

		However , the imperialistic tone that Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has given to his narrative , and his audacity in passing judgment , evidently have pleased the reading public , as a new edition has been brought out in which the chief change seems to be that the four volumes have been bound in two .


E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The new edition of
Augustus J. C. Hare	PERSON	's '' Cities of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , edited and brought down to date by St.
Clair Baddeley	PERSON	, is a model of what such a book should be .

		The Introduction , by the editor , serves to put the traveller into the proper attitude of mind for enjoying this picturesque region .

		Glancing over the text , we find that the larger and heavier type in which the names of the most important places are printed serves to aid the eye in its search ; whatever is most significant in the life and history will usually be found condensed there .

		The maps and plans are uncommonly clear , accurate , and with new names and discoveries well filled in .

		The form and size of the volume are those established by
Baedeker	PERSON	and approved by travellers from the beginning .

		NOTES .

		Mr.
H. V. Sutherland	PERSON	, author of '' Idylls of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' has in preparation a new work , '' The Legend of Love , '' a fantastic tale , to appear this Fall . ''

		How to Capture Sleep '' is the suggestive title of a book by Dr.

B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	will soon publish a volume entitled '' What Tolstoy Taught . ''

		The volume will contain the essence of the Russian reformer 's life-work , practically in his own words .

		The subjects will be classified and indexed , and the book will afford an opportunity to acquire an outline of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's teachings without read - ing his many volumes .

		An interesting sign of the literary development of
Japan	LOCATION	is given in the announcement , by the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Mail '' of
Yokohama	LOCATION	, that the Bungei lin Kwai which is a kind of
Academy of Literature	ORGANIZATION	and Art has selected for translation into Japanese the '' Divine Comedy '' of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faust , ''
Cervantes	PERSON	' ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' and the
Sanskrit Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work of translation will be entrusted to specialists , and it is expected that it will take two or three years to complete it .

		It has required three collaborators Messrs.
Joseph V. Denney	PERSON	,
Carson S. Duncan	PERSON	, and
Frank C. McKinney	PERSON	to produce the text-book of '' Argumentation and Debate '' just published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book consists of a theoretical section , followed by a selection of texts which reproduce the opposing argu - ments upon six subjects of great importance taken from American history .

		Each of these six cases is provided with a set of searching questions for study and analysis .

		A new series of `` English Readings for Schools , '' under the general editorship of Professor
Wilbur L. Cross	PERSON	, has been undertaken by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and seven volumes of the series , well-printed and neatly bound in brown covers , are now at hand .

		This first instalment includes a selection from
Browning	PERSON	's poems , edited by Professor
Charles W. Hodell	PERSON	;
Scott	PERSON	's `` Lady of the Lake , '' edited by Mr.
Alfred M. Hitchcock	PERSON	;
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Treasure Island , '' edited by Mr.
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	; a volume devoted to
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	, edited by Professor
James Weber Linn	PERSON	; and three others .

		A new enterprise undertaken by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is the publication of a '' Home University Library '' of small volumes , at a moderate uniform price , each volume the work of a specialist , and having a concrete subject of its own .

		The general editors of the series are Messrs.
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	,
Herbert Fisher	PERSON	,
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	, and
William T. Brewster	PERSON	.

		The series '' aims to supply the need of laymen and students for readable new works inspired by knowledge of the latest research and critical thought . ''

		No less than a hundred volumes are already planned , and the first ten have been issued .

		They are as follows : ''

The Finest Edition of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	at Less than
Half Price STRATFORD TOWN SHAKESPEARE	ORGANIZATION	, ranking with the finest of editions de luxe , was printed at the
Shakespeare Head Press	ORGANIZATION	at
Stratford	LOCATION	, which was especially established , under the direction of Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	, to do honor to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's memory by printing a worthy edition of his works in his native town .

		It is the only complete edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works ever printed and published in his native town , and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart from any other existing or future edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Format Editorial Features Press	ORGANIZATION	Opinions The set comprises ten royal octavo volumes .

		One thousand numbered sets , on English hand - made paper , have been printed , of which two hundred and fifty are for
America	LOCATION	.

		Each vol - ume contains a photogravure frontispiece , eight being portraits of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, one of
Richard Burbage	PERSON	, the chief actor of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time , and one of the
Earl of Southampton	LOCATION	, Shake - speare 's patron , to whom his Sonnets are supposed to have been dedicated .

		The type is the original Old Face type cut by
William Caslon	PERSON	in the early part of the eighteenth century .

		For the text is used the size known as '' English , '' the songs , etc. , being printed in small pica .

		The lines are numbered at the side .

		An English hand-made paper , with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's crest and coat-of-arms for a water-mark , has been specially manufactured for this edition .

		The edition has been carefully produced under the supervision of Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	, whose scholarly researches in the field of Elizabethan Literature have peculiarly qualified him for the task .

		A unique feature is the elimination of the great mass of notes which usually clog the pages of our great classic and impede the reader .

		Instead , the last volume contains new and original essays which supply in a comprehensive and readable form all the information that the student or private reader requires for the proper appreciation of the great dramatist .

		These essays are as follows : A Memoir of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, by
Henry Davey	PERSON	,

THE CHICAGO THEATRE SOCIETY	ORGANIZATION	.

		We had intended to defer mention of the new organization known as the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	until such time as its plan and pro- gramme should have been definitely decided upon , and its work more fully under way than it is at the date of the present writing .

		But the controversy that has arisen in its directory and among its well-wishers outside the organi - zation affects the movement so vitally , and the outcome thereof means so much to all those who take the drama seriously , that it seems best to outline the subject without any further delay , and to exert whatever influence we may have in behalf of those worthy aims which alone give to such an enterprise its excuse for being .

		To begin with , credit for the enterprise belongs primarily to that sterling actor and determined idealist , Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	.

		We have frequently had occasion to speak of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's efforts for the uplifting of the dramatic art , and to praise his persistence in the right course in the face of manifold kinds of discouragement .

		Despite difficulties which would have utterly disheartened nine men out of ten , this indomitable
Scotchman	PERSON	has for years persevered in his effort to familiarize the public with the masterpieces of dramatic literature , wherever found , and has achieved no mean measure of success , if the term success be taken in anything but its vulgar commercial sense .

		He has produced plays by
Calderon	PERSON	,
Molire	PERSON	,
Goldoni	LOCATION	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and other writers of unassailable fame ; and plays by such moderns , well on their way to become classics , as
Gogol	LOCATION	,
Echegaray	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Bjornson	PERSON	,
Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Sudermann	LOCATION	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		He has found appreciative audiences for these productions in
Chicago	LOCATION	and throughout the
Middle West	LOCATION	, and he has gratified his audiences at the cost of much personal sacrifice .

		Such unselfish devotion to a high artistic aim as he has evidenced is a pleasant thing to discover in an age when the gainful motive may usually be found to underlie the activities of men working in the name of art , and is deserving of all honor .

		During the last few weeks , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	has been engaged in planning a new appeal , one more effective than has hitherto seemed possible , to that section of the public which 64 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 1	DATE	.

		has at heart the rehabilitation of the stage , and which is hungering for the opportunity to witness performances of significant dramatic works instead of becoming acquainted with them solely through the medium of the printed page .

		He has gone about his task in a highly practical manner , and the following is a brief statement of what has been accomplished : First , he has obtained subscriptions to a guar - anty fund which already amounts to upwards of fifty thousand dollars , and which will probably be increased to a much larger sum ; second , he has made a contract with a firm of theatrical managers whereby the latter are to provide one of their best
Chicago	LOCATION	playhouses for a ten weeks ' season beginning next
Janu	PERSON	- ary , engage a company subject to his approval , and pay all the expenses of producing such a list of plays as he and they shall agree upon , taking for their share of the proceeds a fixed percentage of the receipts , and being protected against loss by the fact that a certain minimum is guaranteed them ; third , he has organized the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	, with committees and a board of directors , to act in an advisory capacity and look after matters connected with the financial management of the enterprise ; fourth , he is now engaged in organizing similar societies and securing similar guaranty pledges in several other cities , in order that the company of players may be engaged for a full season of thirty weeks or more .

		This is all very business-like , and plants the whole undertaking firmly upon the solid earth .

		But a rift within the lute has been disclosed which , although it will probably be mended in time to prevent the music from becoming mute , has created a certain amount of dissonance in the tuning-up process .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's auxil - iary Society has manifested a disposition to play the part of the monster created by
Frank	PERSON	- enstein , and to advocate policies considerably at variance with that for which its dramatic director stands .

		There appear to be nearly as many counsels as there are individuals con - cerned , and some of them are so amateurish and ill-advised that it is difficult to understand how they can be seriously urged .


Chicago	LOCATION	's New Theatre experiment of three years ago , and the more recent
New York	LOCATION	venture of the same sort , indicate with fair distinctness what pitfalls await the unwary in such an enterprise , and at least show certain things that are not to be done , if they do not otherwise very clearly point the way to success .

		These profitable examples in the way of negative instruction make it quite certain that the artistic direction of a theatre can not be entrusted to a committee .

		Paralysis of effort and confusion of aim are certain to follow upon any attempt to carry out the ideas of a dozen persons at the same time .

		The prime necessity is to find some one person who knows what is desirable on the artistic side , and who has the executive ability to match his knowledge .

		Given such a director , fully responsible because invested with autocratic powers , and the idea upon which he stakes his reputation will be tested by its own merits ; its effective embodiment will not be jeopardized by artificial and adventitious restrictions .

		In the case now under considera - tion , there can be no question where the power and the responsibility should be lodged ; the man who has set the whole affair in motion , whose clean-cut ideal is '' to produce the great dramas of the world , '' and whose enthusiasm for his ideal has proved contagious enough to gain for the enterprise the requisite financial backing , may not properly be hampered by any imposition of conditions that would tend to weaken his work or obscure the singleness of its aim .

		Most of the advice , gratuitous or official , that has been showered upon Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, seeking to bend him from his artistic purpose , has been so tinctured with opportunism that it does not deserve to be treated with much patience .

		It is not the wisdom of the serpent that is here needed , but that wisdom which is the consort of a clear-eyed faith in the power of the worthy ideal to prevail over the unworthy in the realm of taste .

		The men and women whose pledges have made possible this hopeful new experiment do not wish to save a few paltry dollars at the cost of a lowered aim .

		If the work which they have in view be satisfactorily done , they do not greatly care whether it pays for itself or not .

		The suggestion that a particular play is too far above the heads of its prospective auditors to be suitable for performance is quite beside the mark .

		If it is a great play that ought to be produced , it is their intention to see that it gets a chance ; and it is their belief that among
Chicago	LOCATION	's two millions of people there are a few thousands who care enough for the higher things in dramatic art to support the production of a few great plays every year .

		If the event shall prove that there are not enough of these , the experiment will at least have given keen grati - fication to a considerable number of people , and will have done its part in creating the more refined public taste that we trust will prevail in the coming time .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 The purpose of the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	is not , as we understand it , or as it is viewed by its dramatic director and its guarantors , to make money at the expense of art , either by avoiding plays that are too bright and good for human nature 's daily food , or by selecting plays with regard to the box-office test .

		It is not to exploit the esoteric drama , or the drama of the cult .

		It is not to revive plays that have been fairly tested and proved to be failures by virtue of their inherent dramatic defects .

		It is not to give `` pet plays '' a hearing for no better reason than that individual guarantors would like to see them produced .

		It is not to present novelties because they seem to chime with the capricious taste of the moment .

		It is not , most emphatically not , to stage American plays because they are the work of American writers .

		There could be nothing more foreign to the purpose of the organization than thus to force the American note irrespective of those broad standards of excellence that alone should deter - mine selection .

		What the American public most needs upon its stage is such a series of object-lessons in dramatic form as are at present to be found among the masterpieces of other peoples , more advanced in this field than we are likely to become for many years .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	proposes for his first season a list of plays by such writers as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	,
Pinero	PERSON	,
Synge	PERSON	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Goldoni	LOCATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Bjorn	PERSON	- son ,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Hervieu	PERSON	,
Giacosa	PERSON	, and
Galdos	PERSON	, with perhaps one or two of the best American plays that can be unearthed .

		This is the right sort of a programme , because it aims only at the best , and makes the work of the Society a distinctive thing , standing far apart from rivalry with the ordinary commercial enterprise .

		Mr.
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	has , in a recently published essay , some remarks that are very much to the point .

		He says : '' Those whole classes of exquisite , beautiful things which go out of fashion and are thereafter all but irre - coverable , should be held before the public with as firm a hand as orchestral music has been held before it , and for the same reasons .

		We are always being told by theatrical people that the public taste will or will not support something .

		Does anybody inquire whether the American public likes
Bach	PERSON	or
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, or does anybody take advice of the press as to how the works of those masters shall be played ?

		No .

		The best traditions are followed , the best performers obtained , and the effect upon the public mind is awaited with patience and with certainty . ''

		So with patience , which will doubtless be needed , but also with the certainty of the poet who sang , '' We needs must love the highest when we see it , '' we look forward to a restoration of the art of the stage as a vital influence upon our American life , and we welcome the effort of the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	, and all other effort of like character , to further our progress toward that desirable consummation .

		THE INCONSISTENCIES OF NOVELISTS .

		The world of romance which the novelist invites his reader to enter becomes a very real and desir - able world , for the time being , through the harmo - nious cooperation of both parties to the innocent deception , each of whom has a right to expect that the other will play the game according to the rules and not be guilty of any unfairness , trickery , betrayal of confidence , or lapse of attention to the serious business in hand .

		Consequently , when a writer so far forgets himself as to deny on one page what he has asserted on a preceding , or to make a character do in one chapter what has been made a virtual impossibility for him in an earlier one , the reader has a right to feel aggrieved .

		For instance , if the novelist has laid the scene of his story in
Uruguay	LOCATION	, and his readers have taken the trouble to orientate themselves in that distant region of the southern hemisphere , it would be an unpardonable inadvertence to introduce a Christmas sleighing party or a May-pole dance .

		Or if one of the characters in a novel is represented as a war veteran with a wooden leg , it would impair the verisimilitude to have him suddenly attacked with the gout in both feet .

		Nevertheless , inconsistencies as bad as the fore - going are unblushingly committed by talented and experienced authors who ought to know better .

		Thackeray 's disconcerting tendency to forget the very names of his characters , and to write
Charles	PERSON	, perhaps , in place of
Henry	LOCATION	, or Arabella in place of
Constance	LOCATION	, has already been sufficiently commented on , and in the later editions of his works errors resulting from such carelessness have doubtless been corrected .

		These slips of the pen , however , are readily pardonable , as are similar slips of the tongue in daily life .

		Less excusable , on the other hand , in anyone but
Thackeray	PERSON	, with whose sportive ways we have become familiar , and to whose eccentricities we have perforce become recon - ciled , would be those frequent jocular asides and sly winks with which he intimates to the reader that the whole thing is , after all , only make-believe and need not be taken in the least seriously if one would rather not .

		Such tactics , if pursued by almost any other novelist , would produce speedy disillusionment and weariness , and are not always thoroughly en - joyed even in the incomparable author of '' Vanity Fair . ''

		There is enough of the child , earnest and honest , in most novel-readers , to resent being trifled with in this fashion .

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, Another instance of carelessness , strangely unaccountable in so logical a thinker and careful a writer as
George Eliot	PERSON	, is familiar to readers of her '' Mill on the Floss . ''

		How could an author fond of science , a reader of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, and rather excessively given to the tracing of effects to their adequate causes , commit the absurdity that disfigures the tragical end of the above-named story ?

		Tom and
Maggie	PERSON	, it will be remembered , are adrift in an open boat on a raging flood , when the huge fragments of some heavy machinery come floating -LRB- ! -RRB-

		down upon them .

		Tom , although a stout youth and plying a pair of oars to hasten the boat 's progress , which even if unassisted should at least equal that of the heavy machinery , deliberately abandons the struggle , rises to his feet -LRB- the most foolish thing possible to do in a small boat -RRB- , clasps
Maggie	PERSON	in his arms with melodramatic accompani - ments of gesture and utterance , and so they both perish in a highly useless as well as improbable manner .

		Coming down to more recent writers , we encounter abundant examples of what to a logical reader must seem a wanton disregard of consist - ency .

		In
Marion Crawford	PERSON	's very interesting sequel to `` Fair Margaret , '' which bears the title `` The
Primadonna	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Margaret	PERSON	is represented , on page 133 , as sitting alone in a room that is thus described : '' The music room had a polished wooden floor , and the furniture consisted chiefly of a grand piano and a dozen chairs .

		The walls were tinted a pale green ; there were no curtains at the windows , because they would have deadened sound , and a very small wood fire was burning in an almost miniature fireplace quite at the other end of the room . ''

		This description , being brief , and touching on only essential features , places the room clearly before the mind 's eye ; and the vision has by no means faded when , a little later , the follow - ing sentence is met with : '' She rose presently and turned up the lights , rang the bell , and when the window curtains were drawn , and tea was brought , she did everything she could to make Lushington -LSB- who had just been admitted to the music room -RSB- feel at his ease . ''

		One has a right to protest against this magical appearance of curtains where a mo - ment before there had been none .

		If the writer meant window shades or Venetian blinds in the second passage , he should have said so .

		It is true , a novelist who writes much and rapidly , and whose books maintain a high level of excel - lence , may well be pardoned an occasional minor lapse such as the one just referred to .

		But the deliberate and elaborate creation of an absurdity in a sober and somewhat commonplace chronicle is a different matter .

		Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's `` Oliver Horn '' strains the reader 's credulity , in chapter thirteen , very unnecessarily .

		In that chap - ter ,
Oliver	PERSON	, who is in the employ of Messrs.
Morton	PERSON	,
Slade & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, is given four months ' vacation with extra pay to tide him over till autumn , when his services are expected to be again in de - mand .

		His home is in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, as the author makes sufficiently plain without saying so expressly , and his mother 's heart is aching for his return , while the filially affectionate
Oliver	PERSON	himself is equally desirous of revisiting his parents .

		Never - theless he is counselled by the loving mother not to spend his money in making the journey , but to pass his vacation somewhere in the country ; and so he goes to the mountains , in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, apparently , or at any rate somewhere in
New England	LOCATION	, or possibly in northern
New York	LOCATION	, and pays his board at a farmhouse for four months , when he might far more economically have gone to
Balti	LOCATION	- more and enjoyed the hospitality of his own home .

		This far-fetched excuse the author seems to have used in order to bring his hero and heroine un - expectedly together amid rural surroundings ; but the same end could have been easily accomplished without violating the elementary principles of domestic economy .

		Taking up a very recent and at present much - read novel , '' The Mistress of Shenstone , '' by Mrs.
Florence L. Barclay	PERSON	, one soon lands in an absurdly impossible situation .

		It is where
Jim Airth	PERSON	rescues Lady Ingleby from the rapidly rising tide by hack - ing steps with a large clasp-knife in an almost per - pendicular sand-bank a `` stratum of soft sand '' the writer calls it .

		As if this were not bad enough , the hero is made to go back on another day and cut the steps deeper , for the benefit of any future unfortunates compelled to seek safety by scaling the sixty-foot precipice .

		Even granted the steeply - sloping bank of soft sand , and granted the possi - bility of carving out a practicable stairway on its face , how long would its lower steps withstand the action of the waves beating against the bank with every rising tide ?

		Surely it would have been just as easy for the author to make her bank out of something other than soft sand .

		A not too difficult slope of rock would have answered all the condi - tions , with the agile and amorous
Jim Airth	PERSON	at hand to assist the distressed lady .

		Another grievance , of a rather different nature , might not unfairly be charged against a large number of story-writers .

		This is the unnecessary adoption of the first-person style of narration .

		No man , however extraordinarily gifted , could rehearse a personal experience and at the same time faith - fully reproduce all the actions , words , and very thoughts of everyone concerned in the said ex - perience ; and to call an occasional halt in order to attempt an explanation of this omniscience only makes matters worse .

		The impersonal , or third - personal , narrator of a tale is readily granted to be omniscient , and the reader delights in his minute description of incident , his reproduction of clever conversation , his intuitive knowledge of motive and insight into character ; but the moment he commits the indiscretion of stepping into his own pages , he does indeed `` put his foot into it . ''

		Crawford 's ''
Paul Patoff	PERSON	'' runs along smoothly and delight - fully -LRB- if one has refrained from reading the intro -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 duction -RRB- until about half the story is told , when all at once the narrator thrusts himself in as a character in the book , and the illusion vanishes .

		This trouble - some
Paul Griggs	PERSON	thenceforward does his best to keep us reminded that to his wonderful memory and to his inconceivable powers of clairvoyance we are indebted for the intricate story he is telling .

		There is , of course , the customary occasional refer - ence to subsequent facilities for learning what oc - curred in places where he himself was not present .

		Yet why in the name of all that is artistic must the author thus arbitrarily deny himself the undisputed advantage of third-person narration ?


George Eliot	PERSON	, again , has committed the same offense in one of her '' Scenes from Clerical Life , '' obtruding herself abruptly two or three times as a young man taking part in the events described . ''

		We men '' is one of the phrases used to persuade the reader that ''
George Eliot	PERSON	'' is in very truth a man 's name .

		The story -LRB- ''
Janet	PERSON	's Repentance '' -RRB- is an early at - tempt on the writer 's part , and the first person was not again assumed by her in fiction ; therefore for - giveness is cheerfully accorded .

		But if authors knew how many novels have been thrown aside in dis - pleasure on being found to be written in the first person , they would oftener hesitate about appearing as their own heroes or heroines .

		None but a great master can conquer the difficulties inherent in such an undertaking .

		This picking of flaws may be called an ungrate - ful and ungraceful exercise , and the carping critic may perhaps be advised to curb his censorious pro- pensities until he has produced at least one novel no more faulty than the worst of those mentioned above .

		Effective rejoinder to this is a little diffi - cult , but one may still think oneself entitled to indulge in regrets that the critical are not more invariably added to the creative faculties in those delightful novelists to whom we owe so much pleas - ure and refreshment , even as one regrets , in a keener and more personal fashion , that the creative are not more often added to the critical faculties .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		GERMAN BOOK-PUBLISHING AND BOOK-SELLING METHODS easily maintain a conspicuous superiority over those of most other countries , and especially over those of our own benighted land of literary piracy and of tardy and imperfect acknowledgment of a man 's right to the products of his brain .

		As a significant illustration of those more excellent methods about which Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, the eminent publisher who has so long and so elo - quently protested against the iniquities of our copy - wrong regulations , wrote with the knowledge of an expert in the preceding issue of THE DIAL we take occasion to call attention to the enviable record of the house of Tauchnitz , known to Americans chiefly for its exceptionally faultless and inexpen - sive reprints of the principal modern classics in the English language .

		The growth of the Tauchnitz collection of British and American authors has been one of cumulative rapidity ever since , in
1841	DATE	, the quixotic publisher of
Leipzig	LOCATION	proposed to the first English author on his list -LRB- it was
Bulwer Lytton	PERSON	, and the first Tauchnitz reprint was '' Pelham '' -RRB- to pay him an entirely voluntary royalty on a reissue of his works in
Germany	LOCATION	, as a '' step toward a literary relationship '' between the two countries concerned such literary or copyright relationship having no existence at that time .

		It is interesting to trace the history of this venture , from its beginning with three books a year to its present record of two each week , and its total of more than forty-two hundred reprints .

		All the great names of modern English and American literature are represented on this roll of something more than empty honor .

		Like the righteous man of the psalmist , the first
Baron von Tauchnitz	PERSON	prospered in whatsoever he undertook , and his son and successor , the second
Baron	PERSON	, has maintained his father 's prestige .

		In one room of the great establishment built up by the two there is preserved a remarkable collection of autograph letters from grateful authors who have expressed their sense of obligation to the honest
Leipzig	LOCATION	pub - lisher among them being
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Disraeli	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	,
Robert Louis Steven	PERSON	- son ,
Washington Irving	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and innumerable others .

		`` HAMLET '' AT THE IMPERIAL THEATRE IN TOKIO , in a literal translation expressly made by Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	, constitutes a recent event of the first importance in the play-going world of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		By a new departure , and one that promises well for the improvement of Japanese dramatic art , the tragedy was staged in foreign style and the female parts were played by women .

		Miss
Matsui	PERSON	is said to have filled the role of Ophelia with exceptional skill , while the characters of Hamlet , Polonius , and
Claudius	PERSON	were very creditably presented .

		For some years the Japanese have been more or less familiar with a Japanized stage version of Hamlet , but Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	's is the first faithful , or approx - imately faithful , rendering of the play into the vernacular ; and it will readily be believed that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's lines have taxed to the full the lin - guistic ingenuity of the translator , the interpretive powers of the players , and the comprehension of the audience .

		A word of interest reaches us con - cerning the new playhouse where this new render - ing of `` Hamlet '' was so successfully undertaken .

		The erection and opening of the Imperial Theatre -LRB- which , despite its name , is not a subsidized or a government-controlled playhouse -RRB- may be taken as a sign of promise in a hitherto theatrically barbaric land .

		European in its general architecture , and attempting some approach to
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	ideals and methods on its stage , it especially distinguishes 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, itself by having connected with it a school for the training of actresses , thus declaring itself opposed to the time-honored custom of allowing none but male actors to appear behind the footlights , even in female parts .

		By a circular process which in this instance , it is hoped , will bear no resemblance to the `` vicious '' circle the laudable purpose is to qualify women for the elevation of the stage , and then with their aid to make the stage a means of elevating women .

		Of course the reform of the stage is not to be accomplished in a day , either in
Japan	LOCATION	or elsewhere ; and it will be years before the new Tokio theatre can be expected to make itself worthy of any sort of comparison with theatres in the capitals of the western world .

		A SURVEY OF ECCENTRIC LITERATURE , With brief mention of many little-known examples of this large and constantly - growing class of printed mat - ter , is republished from `` The Monist '' in a handy little pamphlet of twelve pages , from the pen of Mr.
Arthur MacDonald	PERSON	.

		He calls the misguided authors of these works '' mattoids '' in preference to '' cranks , '' and divides their writings into seven classes .

		Of mattoid or decadent poets , he says that their effusions '' keep one 's mind on the stretch in a vacuum , like a conundrum without an answer . ''

		He incidentally remarks , too , that '' some persons also regard the Bacon-Shakespeare controversies as eccentric literature . ''


Thomas Wirgman	PERSON	, the English mattoid who spent a fortune in publishing his voluminous works , very few of which have found purchasers , he places `` at the commencement of this century , '' evidently meaning the nineteenth century .

		In classing
Baxter	PERSON	's sermon on `` Hooks and Eyes for Believers ' Trousers '' with eccentric literature , he is certainly right as far as oddity of imagery is concerned , though one is loth to believe that the eloquent nonconformist was a mattoid .

		But Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	is classed with the eccentrics by reason of his essays in biblical inter - pretation , so that
Baxter	PERSON	is in good company .

		A concluding list of * ' Writings on Eccentric Litera - ture '' a department of bibliography containing as yet but few titles might advantageously have included
John Fiske	PERSON	's excellent though brief treatise on the subject .

		Indeed , it was Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	himself who , while serving as assistant librarian at
Harvard	LOCATION	, introduced , for cataloguing purposes , the term `` ec - centric literature , '' which may to this day -LRB- unless recently discarded -RRB- be found as a subject-entry in that catalogue .

		INVOLUNTARY AUTOPLAGIARISM , or the uninten - tional repetition of one 's own good things in print , forms one of the minor lapses of not a few authors who write much and rapidly , and have been plying the pen for a good many years .

		Even so compara - tively new a writer as the author of '' Somehow Good '' is said to experience already considerable perplexity when a bright thought occurs to him and he wishes to turn it to literary account , but can not make sure whether he has not already used it and forgotten the fact .


Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	somewhere speaks of the strangeness which a piece of earlier writing has worn to his older eyes when by chance it has come to his notice ; and he has often wondered where he found certain long-forgotten ideas and how he managed to dress them up with such dexterity and originality , being in fact con - strained to admire the young genius who was his own earlier self but who interested him as would some entirely new and unknown writer .


William Black	PERSON	, too , used to find his own first ventures in fiction as unfamiliar to his older eyes as if they had been the novels of another author .

		May it not be that the mind , like the body , is continually being re-made , and that the mind of the sixty-year-old man , though retaining the ground-plan and per - haps some of the framework of the thirty - year-old man , is nevertheless , in elevation and ornamentation , and even in general style of architecture , virtually another and a different mind ?

		Not , of course , with those who mature at twenty-five and never there - after assimilate a new idea or rid themselves of an old one ; but with such vegetables the present observations do not concern themselves .

		A PROPHETIC EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY VISITOR TO
AMERICA	LOCATION	, Dr.
Johann David Schoepf	PERSON	, wrote a book of his travels , wherein he paid generous tribute to the manifest excellences of American character , but failed not to point out certain defects , conspicuous among which was that spirit of improvidence and waste that even in 1783-84 struck this impartial observer as threatening the impoverishment of our forests and the reduction of the country to a treeless barrenness such as certain regions of the old world have long since brought upon themselves .

		Dr.
Schoepf	PERSON	, besides being a liberally educated man , and the holder in his later years of the presidency of the
United Medical College of Ansbach	ORGANIZATION	and
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, was also specially trained in forestry , and thus qualified to speak with authority on the abuse which our woodlands were seen by him to suffer .

		His urbanity , and his readiness to praise everything American that seemed to him praiseworthy , give impressiveness and weight to such strictures as he allows himself to indulge in .

		To Americans of the present day , few of whom are likely ever to have heard of the book , it should prove interesting and profitable reading ; and it has just been rendered easily accessible in an English version by the efforts of Mr.
Alfred J. Morrison	PERSON	, translator , and of Mr.
W. J. Campbell	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, publisher .

		THE COLLEGE AND THE STAGE are brought into relations beneficial to the stage , and to some extent mutually beneficial , in the attention officially or unofficially paid to dramatic art at all our leading universities and colleges .

		The leaven of culture works from above downward , the chief difficulty being that the ferment too often ceases in the upper strata of humanity 's mass .

		Nevertheless Mr.
Walter 1911	PERSON	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69
Prichard Eaton	PERSON	, the widely-known dramatic critic , did not hesitate to say the other day in a lecture that formed one of this
summer	DATE	's series at the Isles of Shoals : '' The most effective work for the eleva - tion of the stage is being done to-day in our colleges , especially in
Harvard	LOCATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		There the drama is treated as a serious branch of the fine arts ; and not alone the drama of the printed page , but of the prac - tical playhouse . ''

		The course in play-construction at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has already been approvingly referred to by us , and Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	believes that '' not only does it increase in all men who take it the knowl - edge and understanding of the stage , but by its mere presence in the curriculum of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	it adds to the dignity of the drama as an art , and it inspires respect for the drama in all the students . ''

		At Rad cliff e , too , the study of the drama is pro- ducing some noteworthy results . ''

		The End of the Bridge , '' a spirited production that enjoyed a run of many weeks at a
Boston	LOCATION	theatre last season , was the work of a
Radcliffe	ORGANIZATION	undergraduate , and , if not a masterpiece , was at least a refined and wholesome piece of playwriting .

		THE FIRST YEAR OF
KENTUCKY	LOCATION	'S LIBRARY COM - MISSION shows at least hopeful beginnings of use - ful activity .

		The bill creating this commission went into effect
June 13 , 1910	DATE	, and the five commis - sioners appointed by the Governor held their first meeting
July 26	DATE	.

		There is now issued by the commission its first bulletin , a plentifully-illustrated fifty-page pamphlet entitled `` Handbook of
Kentucky	LOCATION	Libraries . ''

		As late as
1907	DATE	, nine years after the passage of laws enabling all cities and towns to establish free public libraries , there were only nine such libraries in the seventeenth richest State in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But the four years since then have shown gratifying activity in library-founding , thanks largely to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's substantial aid , which amounts to
$ 716,889	MONEY	distributed among thirteen cities and villages and one college -LRB-
Berea	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The `` Handbook '' gives a list of twenty-eight public libraries and nine college , normal school , theologi - cal seminary , and law libraries , besides the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Frankfort	LOCATION	, the latter having the very re - spectable size of one hundred and ten thousand volumes .

		The
Louisville Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is the largest in the
State	ORGANIZATION	, with nearly one hundred and thirty thousand volumes and a circulation of six hundred thousand .

		No fewer than twenty-one travelling-library stations have been established in the eleven months or less of the commission 's exist - ence .

		The
Blue-grass State	ORGANIZATION	is evidently awaking at last to the literary needs of its people .

		TOLSTOI 'S POSTHUMOUS WRITINGS seem likely , if they all find their way into print , to fill some forty or fifty volumes .

		The journals alone are said to contain matter for about thirty printed volumes , and besides these there are a score or more of works of various sorts , including a play gruesomely entitled `` The Living Corpse , '' which is to be put on the stage in
Paris	LOCATION	, and which is said to bear some resemblance in its theme to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's little story of `` Wakefield . ''

		Mr.
Aylmer Maude	PERSON	's excellent two-volume biography , first published about the time of
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's death , has recently been extended so as to become more nearly complete ; and another full account of the man is promised from the pen of
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	, of '' Jean-Christophe '' fame .

		One can feel pretty sure in advance that the French - man 's book will not lack interesting detail skilfully treated , and that it will present the great Russian from a new point -LRB- or several new points -RRB- of view .

		NOVEL METHODS OF JOURNALISTIC CONTROVERSY prevail in
England	LOCATION	, if we may judge by a recent tilt between The Spectator '' and '' The English Re - view . ''

		The latter periodical , having been charged by `` The Spectator '' with `` dumping garbage upon the nation 's doorstep , '' sends out a circular signed by fifty names prominent in current English literature -LRB- including Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, and Miss May Sinclair -RRB- , protesting against the attack of '' The Spectator '' and characterizing it as '' per - secution '' Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	lending the additional interpretation that `` The Spectator is a prig . ''

		It would seem to us that the `` Review '' is too able and reputable a periodical to stand in need of such a vindication ; but we cheerfully give it publicity , as requested by the editor , Mr.
Austin Harrison	PERSON	.

		A GRAVE PROBLEM FOR EDUCATORS Was dlSCUSSed on the closing day of the late annual convention of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	at
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco .

		It was probably the most serious question that had come up for debate , and it brought out some significant facts and figures .

		The `` backward child problem , '' according to Dr.
Maximilian P. E. Grossman	PERSON	, of
Plainfield	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, is truly a serious one .

		Between four million and five million of our schoolchildren are of this type , and of these at least half a million are distinctly abnormal .

		The adoption of stringent measures to prevent the propagation of the type was advocated by several participants in the discussion .

		Here , apparently , is a question with which the comparatively new science of eugenics might beneficently concern itself .

		A HOT SUMMER 'S `` BEST-SELLER '' seems thus far to have been '' The Broad Highway , '' that novel whose pre-publication history has furnished con - siderable entertainment to the readers of current literary chronicle and comment .

		It was only three days after the book 's issue in this country , its pub - lishers say , that '' the advance reviews had aug - mented the sales so that we went to press for a fourth time .

		Since
February	DATE	we have printed about two editions a month until the eleventh has been reached , and ' The Broad Highway ' is in more active demand than any novel we have issued in a decade . ''

		As was to be expected , a second novel from Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	is in process of creation .

		70 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, Two YEARS ix THE ANTARCTIC .

		* Whatever the importance of the results attained by the
Second Charcot Antarctic Expedition	ORGANIZATION	, as viewed by geographers , ocean - ographers , hydrographers , seismographers , geo - logists , zoologists , botanists , bacteriologists , glaciologists , and other scientists , that expedi - tion is chiefly memorable to the general reader for the excellent book it has produced at the hands of its devoted leader , Dr.
Jean Charcot	PERSON	, distinguished son of a still more distinguished father .

		`` The Voyage of the ` Why Not ? '

		in the Antarctic '' is a large and handsomely illus - trated volume , comparable in its generous pro- portions , its fulness of detail , and its variety of interest , with that other recent record of South Polar exploration , `` The Heart of the Antarctic , '' by Sir
Ernest Shackleton	PERSON	.

		The periods of time covered by the two expeditions overlapped each other by a year , but the En - glish and the French explorers were separated by a hundred degrees of longitude , the English - man being at work in the region to the south of
New Zealand	LOCATION	, while his friendly rival had chosen the more difficult scene of his first Antarctic explorations -LRB- in the '' Fran9ais , '' 1903-1905 -RRB- , the little-known coasts and islands lying over against the extreme southern point of
South America	LOCATION	.

		There was no prospect of any approach to the
Pole	LOCATION	by this route , but there was a good outlook for discoveries of interest to geographers and others , and it was a region already somewhat familiar to Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	.

		His purpose is thus expressed in his own words : '' My exact object was to study in detail and from all points of view as wide a stretch as possible of the Antarctic in this sector of the circle , regardless of latitude .

		I knew that I had chosen the region where ice confronts the navigator as far north as 61 , where innumerable icebergs dot the sea , and where the coast - line is fringed with high mountains , to all appearances insurmountable .

		I had no hope therefore of approach - ing the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless , lest any one should cry ' sour grapes ! '

		I must hasten to say that if I had had the chance of stumbling on a road by which I could realise the dream of all Polar explorers I should have made for the Pole enthusiastically and should certainly have spared nothing to reach it . ''

St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	, was a sturdy vessel of forty metres in length at the water * THE VOYAGE OF THE `` WHY NOT ? ''

		line , nine and two-tenths metres beam , and with a water-draught of four and three-tenths metres when loaded .

		The rigging was that of a three-masted barque , the masts being excep - tionally strong and short , and every other part of the equipment designed especially for hard usage .

		In harmony with the sentiment and the truly devout zeal inspiring all connected with the expedition was the solemn baptismal ceremony which the '' Pourquoi-Pas ? ''

		under - went at her launching , the officiating priest being
Monseigneur Biou	PERSON	, who had also baptized the '' Francais . ''

		It was with a staff of seven competent specialists and a crew of twenty-one picked men , eight of whom had served in the '' Fran ^ ais '' expedition , that Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	set sail from
Havre	LOCATION	on the fifteenth of
August , 1908	DATE	.

		After touching at
Rio Janeiro	LOCATION	,
Buenos Aires	PERSON	, and other ports , and receiving generous aid and cordial encouragement , the intrepid '' Why Not ? ''

		turned her prow toward the un - known South , pausing only at
Punta Arenas	LOCATION	, where
Madame Charcot	PERSON	took leave of her husband and returned to
France	LOCATION	.

		For a little over a year , or from
December 1908	DATE	to Janu - ary
1910	DATE	, the explorers were engaged in their appointed work , interrupted of course by the semi-inactivity of a winter -LRB- our
summer of 1909	DATE	-RRB- amid the ice .

		Concerning the results achieved in the open season of
1908-1909	DATE	, the comman - der of the expedition expresses his satisfaction in the following retrospective summary .

		`` Our
summer	DATE	campaign had been more fruitful than we could have hoped , since we had surveyed a considerable extent of new coast south of
Adelaide Land	LOCATION	, reached
Alexander I. Land	PERSON	, corrected the charts , and discovered a big bay north of
Adelaide Land	LOCATION	, while making during our voyage numerous soundings , drags , and observations of all kinds . ''

		In the season 1909-10 further researches were prosecuted , chiefly to the westward of
Petermann Island	LOCATION	where the winter had been passed , and a new coast was discovered and finally named -LRB- after considerable urgency on the part of geographers and other friends of the discoverer -RRB- `` Charcot Land '' not , as the modest explorer insists , in his own honor , but in filial respect to the memory of his father , of Salpetriere fame .

		It is worth noting by the way that what seems to be a further tribute to the deceased Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	is found in the name of
Salpetriere Bay	LOCATION	, in the same region .

		Such , then , in general were the activities of the zealous French explorer and his companions on those vaguely-defined and perpetually ice - bound coasts of what has long been loosely -LRB- and , Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	says , incorrectly -RRB- known as Graham
1911	DATE	.

		J THE BIAJL 71 Land , and in the adjacent islands and along a considerable stretch of territory or ocean , or both , toward the west .

		At no time did the '' Pourquoi-Pas ? ''

		attain a higher latitude than seventy degrees and some minutes , as indicated by the map in the book : and this of course bears no comparison with Sir
Ernest Shackleton	PERSON	's approach to within one hundred and twelve miles of the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		However , Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	was not out on a Pole-hunting expedition , and there is no ground for disappointment or grievance on his side or ours .

		He has furnished us a de - lightful , because so manifestly straightforward and unstudied , narrative of his two-years out - ing ; and we shall give ourselves the pleasure of quoting a few more passages of a typical nature from his pages .

		With the exception of two preliminary chapters , the entire account is in the form of a diary , which one is glad to believe has had and has needed very little editing .

		Here and there , and far of tener than they could be found in the journal of an English or American or Scandinavian explorer , occur tenderly sentimental passages from the French - man 's pen .

		This is the way the first of
January , 1909	DATE	, was ushered in : '' As midnight struck , every bell 011 board , the fog - horns and the phonographs gave forth their sounds in a deafening discord to welcome the New Year .

		We eat , in accordance with the custom which makes this bring good luck , some fresh grapes which were pre - sented to us for the occasion by
M. Blanchard	ORGANIZATION	at
Punta Arenas	ORGANIZATION	.

		Packed in sawdust , they had already made the journey from
Malaga	LOCATION	, so that they are of a certain age ; and yet they taste as if they had just been picked .

		Chollet -LSB- the skipper -RSB- , the old companion of all my travels , comes first , as at
Port Lockroy	LOCATION	in
1905	DATE	, to shake my hand .

		Then Libois , the oldest on board , who has also served me long , brings me a very nice letter signed by all the crew .

		On their part the staff came forward to shake the hands of our brave and devoted helpers .

		Then , both fore and aft , we wash down with the generous wines of
France	LOCATION	, an abundant supper . ''

		In the same spirit of loyalty and affection toward their commander was the crew 's celebra - tion of his wedding anniversary .

		The fourth anniversary , too , of the return of the previous expedition under Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	was an occasion for sentiment . ''

		Gourdon and
Rosselin	PERSON	gave the toasts .

		My brave and faithful follower ,
Chollet	PERSON	, companion on my jour - neys for twenty-five years , pushed forward by
Gourdon	PERSON	, tried to speak in his turn , but he was very agitated , and after a few stammering words he thought of something better , for he shook my hand in such a way that I understood the affectionate devotion with which he was overflowing .

		I was extremely touched by this mani - festation , the responsibility for which Gourdon and the crew laid on one another .

		The veterans had already shown me their affection and confidence by asking to join the new expedition , and I have every reason to believe that their sentiments towards me are shared by the new-comers .

		We drank champagne , ate plum pudding , and chatted gaily . ''

		Further means of beguiling the time in winter quarters were found in the arts , of many kinds ; in toboganning , snow-shoeing , ski-ing , and other forms of competitive athletics ; in much reading , and in some writing , including the elaboration of a serial novel , '' The Typist 's Lover , '' chap - ters of which the author , Lieutenant Rouch , read aloud every evening to the eagerly - attentive company .

		Concerning the ship 's library , we learn the following : '' We have fortunately an extremely well-furnished library with about 1,500 volumes of scientific works , travel-books , novels , plays , and artistic and classical literature , to distract , instruct , or help us in our work .

		The crew has the right of dipping into these to a great extent , but I have thought it best to strike off the catalogue for their use a whole series of volumes that seemed to me harmful , or at least useless , to most of these good fellows , who are happily still very much children of nature .

		The volumes which circulate most in the ward-room are undoubtedly those of the Dictionnaire Larousse , which , apart from the instruc - tion which it gives us in our isolation from the rest of the world , cuts short , if it does not completely check , discussions which would - otherwise threaten to be inter - minable .

		Whether or not Larousse provides the solu - tion , in a life like ours discussions are inevitable .

		They are one of the occupations , often one of the plagues , of Polar expeditions , and I well understand why , during a celebrated English Antarctic expedition , they should have been punished by fines when they overran the comparatively short hours when they were permitted .

		I must hasten to add that on our ship they seldom turned bitter , and the clouds which they may have raised quickly dispersed . ''

		Researches of vast importance to the civilized world do not seem often to suggest themselves to Antarctic explorers , but many minor ques - tions of some interest to the curious are still waiting to be answered .

		For example , the zoologist of the `` Why Not ? ''

		one day fastened celluloid rings of various colors to the legs of numerous penguins , young and old , and of several cormorants , in the hope of gaining some knowledge later as to the habitual movements of these birds .

		Certain writers have asserted that the parents do not return to the old rookery a second season , and that only the young who were hatched there make it their abiding place the next year .

		But the French zoologist 's experiments and observations seemed to prove that exactly the contrary procedure was the rule .

		And so life 's problems are diminished by at least one , thanks to the second Charcot Antarctic expedition .

		Interesting to all readers of Arctic voyages and discoveries is the considerable difference 72 THE DiAJL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, in the conditions to be met and the difficulties to be overcome by Antarctic explorers .

		A book by Captain
Peary	PERSON	or by
Fridtjof Nansen	PERSON	, and one by Lieutenant Shackleton or Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	, though describing in general very similar opera - tions , re veal to the reader a marvellous difference in details of equipment and method .

		So great is this difference that whereas Captain
Peary	PERSON	has with justifiable pride written of his crowning achievement as if nothing of any great moment now remained to be accomplished by polar ex - plorers , the conquest of the
South Pole	LOCATION	really confronts them as a problem whose solution has hardly been facilitated by the antipodal victory .

		In conclusion , high commendation is due to the translator and the publishers of Dr.
Charcot	PERSON	's book .

		Errors of translating or of printing do inevitably occur , but they seem to be few .

		One could have wished for a larger - scale map of the discoverer 's route , and also for a final summary of things accomplished .

		The one map given -LRB- of the whole Antarctic region -RRB- is very inadequate .

		But the illustrations , from photographs , are all that could be desired .

		MEMOIRS OF AN EMINENT PHYSICIAN .

		* The
Emmet	PERSON	family is most closely associated with the history of
Ireland	LOCATION	, especially with movements for Irish independence .

		Some of its members have found their way to our own land , but expatriation has not lessened their interest in the struggle for Irish self-rule .

		Among the Emmets who emigrated in an early day was Dr.
Thomas Addis Emmet	PERSON	, one of the revolutionary leaders of
1798	DATE	, who came to
New York	LOCATION	a century ago .

		His grandson of the same name is still a citizen of
New York	LOCATION	, and like his grandfather -LRB- also a lawyer -RRB- is an hon - ored member of the physicians ' guild .

		Again like his grandfather , Dr.
Thomas Addis Emmet	PERSON	the younger is a militant defender of Irish rights ; and for a decade , as president of the
Irish Federation of America	ORGANIZATION	, he directed the American forces in the home-rule campaign .

		Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	was born in
1828	DATE	, at
Charlottes	LOCATION	- ville ,
Virginia	LOCATION	, where his father was professor of chemistry and materia medico , at the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		When he wrote the preface to his memoirs , in
1910	DATE	, he could look back over an eventful life of more than four-score years .

		It is a large volume that he has given us , for Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	has remembered much .

		lias not contributed all the materials ; the au - thor has opinions as well as information , and these are stated with force and freedom .

		There are few subjects of current interest that are not discussed in the volume : the suffragette move - ment , the public schools , the protective tariff , the Declaration of Independence , the manage - ment of hospitals , the Irish question , the money question , these are a few of the more impor - tant problems included .

		A large part of the work is naturally devoted to the trials and triumphs of the busy physician .

		At the age of eighteen Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	began the study of medicine , and after graduation located in the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		He rose rapidly to great eminence in the medical world ; in the words of his friend ,
T. P. O'Connor	PERSON	, he became `` one of the glories and one of the glowing lights of the medical profession . ''

		Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	believes that he was u at the head of the largest public and private practice any man was ever held responsible for . '' ''

		I have approximated the number under my care , and for whose treat - ment I was directly or indirectly responsible in hospital and private practice , as between ninety and one hundred thousand women . ''

		Still the busy physician found time and energies for matters of wider interest .

		He grew to maturity during the fierce political conflict that led up to the Civil War .

		Slavery was an abomination to him , but as to the rights of secession he had not the least doubt .

		When his native state ,
Virginia	LOCATION	, left the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, he promptly repaired to
Montgomery	PERSON	to offer his services , which fortunately were refused .

		He returned to
New York	LOCATION	and quietly resumed his practice .

		Since
1861	DATE	his opinions of men and measures must have changed materially .

		`` As a Southern man , I detested Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, but he became finally , in my estimation , one of the greatest and purest of patriots , '' accom - plishing more for the nation than any other individual since
Washington	LOCATION	.

		But on the sub - ject of the relations existing between state and nation , he is still '' unreconstructed , '' as the following extract will show : `` The Administration at
Washington	LOCATION	, except in its foreign relations , was never considered to possess any of the attributes of a government before the Civil War , and was only termed the Administration ...
The United States Administration	ORGANIZATION	exists to-day as a full - fledged Government , with almost unlimited power , gained by usurpation in every branch of the Executive and first claimed as a necessity during the Civil War .

		... Yet the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	is still -LSB- supposed to exist in all its original integrity ! ''

		In his account of certain important develop -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 ments of the war period such as the draft riots , and the election of
1864	DATE	the author is inter - esting and illuminating .

		He attributes the riots largely to the arbitrary manner in which the draft was carried out by the Federal authori - ties .

		The following is given as an example : '' The husband of a wet-nurse employed in my house was a workman in a factory on the east side , with serenteen other Democrats and one Republican ; to my knowledge , the eighteen Democrats were all drafted , and the Republican was the only one who escaped . ''

		Other instances of a like nature are cited .

		Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	also charges the Republican election officials with deliberate efforts to prevent Demo - crats from voting for
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	in
1864	DATE	.

		He went to the polls after breakfast on election day , but it was five in the afternoon before he was able to cast his vote , and then only after having found a bondsman to give security that he was
Thomas Addis Emmet	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, '' although I was personally known to every man in the room . ''

		Later in life Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	developed a keen historical interest .

		He built up the Emmet collection , investigated problems in American history , wrote a genealogy of the
Emmet	PERSON	family , and produced two important volumes on
Ireland	LOCATION	under English rule .

		Of all these activities he writes in his usual naive fashion .

		With the current American histories he is much dis - pleased , as they magnify
New England	LOCATION	at the expense of the South . ''

		This conviction is based on the study of more orig - inal material , probably , than any other private individ - ual , much of which constituted a portion of the 'Em met Collection ' now in the
Lenox Library	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of the perversion of Irish history by English writers , no other country has suffered to a greater extent than we have from wilful misrepresenta - tion of the truth in not giving credit to other sections . ''

		How a physician with the greatest practice in history could find time for such extended re - search is not explained .

		Of particular importance is Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	's account of his activities in behalf of Irish Nationalism .

		He took an early interest in the struggle of his Irish kinsmen , but active enthusiasm dates from his visit to the British Isles in
1871	DATE	.

		For the revolutionary methods employed by some of the Irish agitators the use of dynamite , for instance he has little sympathy ; still , he feels that the English coercion laws had virtually created a state of war , and that the Irish were consequently justi - fied in using violent methods .

		While anxious to give full credit to Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	for most efficient service , he disclaims having had any personal admiration for him at any time , and feels that his removal from Irish politics was providential .

		Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	does not seem disposed to favor complete independence for
Ireland	LOCATION	; his solution would be a British federation with home-rule for each of the component parts .

		But he would surely favor no strong federal bond .

		In addi - tion to a separate government , he argues that
Ireland	LOCATION	must revive her ancient language . ''

		With Home Rule and an
Irish Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, with its proceedings conducted in English , it would be nothing more than an appendage to the
Imperial Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		But let the business be conducted entirely in the Irish language , as it should be , not for the purpose of concealment , but as the means of obtaining a dignified bond of union , and this would establish a pride of coun - try which it would be difficult for
England	LOCATION	to corrupt . ''

		As to the immediate future of the Emerald Isle , the author writes in an optimistic vein .

		Some form of home-rule seems sure to come , and Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	takes a natural delight in the thought that he has had some share in main - taining the agitation .

		During the nineties , when Conservatism was in the saddle and the
Nationalist	ORGANIZATION	party was facing ruin through lack of campaign funds , it was largely through the efforts of the
Irish Federation	ORGANIZATION	, of which Dr.
Emmet	PERSON	was the energetic president , that the Irish party was enabled to keep up an aggres - sive fight at the elections . ''

		- There remains , '' he says , '' but one cloud to obscure the future of the Irish people , the failure to the present time in regaining the use of their native lan - guage , and the great apathy existing with so many as to the importance of such an acquire - ment . ''

		THE CONCLUSION or A GREAT WORK .

		* In
1898	DATE	appeared the first general circular of `` The Cambridge Modern History . ''

		The present board of editors assumed their duties in
November , 1901	DATE	, not quite ten years ago , and the first volume appeared in

		With the publication of '' The Latest Age '' the end has now been reached of a great undertaking great in conception and in labor , and great even in execution .

		Two supplementary vol - umes are yet to appear , one presenting maps , the other a general index : both valuable addenda to the text of the completed work , but adding nothing to the historical presenta - tion of the earlier volumes .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, History , it will perhaps not be amiss to recall something of the plan and purpose of the work as outlined by
Lord Acton	PERSON	in the nineties .

		That '' prodigy of learning '' conceived a history of modern times , '' each chapter to be written by the most competent available expert , wher - ever he hailed from , nothing written at second hand to appear . ''

		... '' Our principle should be to supply help to students , not material to historians .

		... It is intended that the narra - tive shall be such as will serve all readers , that it shall be without notes , and without quotations in foreign languages . ''

		Cambridge was to pro- duce '' the best history of modern times that the published or unpublished sources of infor - mation admit . ''

		These excerpts express briefly a few -LRB- not all -RRB- of the points
Lord Acton	PERSON	deemed essential to his ideal of a successful modern history .

		Hav - ing impregnated his contributing specialists with his own ideals , he proposed to work with them , preparing certain topics himself , giving editorial supervision to the whole , and depend - ing upon a unity of purpose and expert knowl - edge to produce a connected and authentic narrative .

		With regard to the inauguration of the vast enterprise , the editors of his '' Cam - bridge Lectures '' write : ' < Many universities and two continents were ransacked for contri - butors .

		Five chapters none alas !

		written
Acton	PERSON	had allotted to himself , and in the titles of the others -LRB- not always retained since -RRB- his personal characteristics received pregnant expression . ''

		But the demands of such a task were tremendous , and it soon appeared that
Acton	LOCATION	'' was without that driving force needed to keep in line a heterogeneous body of special - ists , '' and before the first volume was off the press the Regius Professor of History had laid down his pen .

		Upon
Lord Acton	PERSON	's death , the execution of this great undertaking fell to the board of editors through whose efforts the twelve volumes , up to and including the pres - ent one , have appeared .

		\ The present writer has reviewed in THE DIAL four of the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern His - tory '' volumes , these being the first four in historical sequence , though not published in that order .

		In each case it was pointed out , with a varying degree of emphasis , that while the work was a great work , invaluable to schol - ars for its accuracy and for its well-selected references , the volume in question departed from the avowed intention of
Lord Acton	LOCATION	in two important particulars : first , the chapters were not always written by the best qualified specialist upon the matter under consideration ; and second ,
Lord Acton	PERSON	's dream or ideal of a
Universal History	ORGANIZATION	`` distinct from the combined history of all countries , ... but a continuous development , ... an illumination of the soul , '' had somehow not been realized .

		The volumes thus criticized cover the period from the begin - ning of the Renaissance to the end of the Thirty Years ' War .

		If , for the earlier volumes , the editors were hampered by a dearth of specialists , and were obliged themselves to write approxi - mately a third of the chapters , how much more difficult it would seem to provide experts for present-day history , and how much more diffi - cult to realize that unity in the narrative , that '' continuous development '' of which
Acton	ORGANIZATION	so hopefully wrote .

		Yet it is precisely that seem - ingly impossible continuity that characterizes this last volume . ''

		The Latest Age , '' save for one chapter , offers an organized and absorbing narrative , distinguished for its authority and for its emphasis upon those related lines of de - velopment common to the history of all nations .

		The one chapter alluded to is that on '' For - eign Relations of the
United States	LOCATION	during the Civil War , '' by Professor
Westlake	PERSON	, formerly of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	; and the chapter was in - serted because the editors felt '' that these rela - tions had been insufficiently explained in the American volume -LRB- Vol .

		VII . -RRB-

		, and further elucidation was needed for the clear under - standing of the
Alabama	LOCATION	Question , which looms large in the opening years of our period . ''

		As an important factor influencing American atti - tude toward
England	LOCATION	, the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	'' case is indeed important ; but national feeling was of greater importance than were the facts and the law of the case .

		These latter must indeed be stated , in any historical account ; but taken alone they mean nothing , and it is just here that the chapter in question is disappointing .

		It offers merely a technical legal examination of the relations of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, with an argued defense of
England	LOCATION	's action in the recognition of Southern belligerent rights , and in the case of the `` Trent . ''

		It acknowledges
England	LOCATION	's error in failing to stop the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' and in failing to arrest her when she entered British colonial ports .

		This is now conceded by all modern English his - torians , while the strict legality of the English position on belligerency and in the case of the `` Trent '' is equally conceded in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		If diplomatic history is to limit itself to international law and to legal argument , the chapter is satisfactory .

		To the people of the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 North , however , the specific official acts of any foreign government were of distinctly less im - portance than the general attitude of the foreign public .

		Unquestionably the sentiment and sympathies of the British people were of the greatest moment , while formal governmental action might be a matter of relative indiffer - ence .

		The author states , indeed , that `` the chief source of the feeling in the North probably lay in the disappointed hope that the anti- slavery sentiment , in which
England	LOCATION	had led the world , would induce her to grant to the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	cause a benevolent and not an im - partial neutrality . ''

		This is a part of the truth , but not all .

		Americans believed and with some foundation for their belief that the governing classes of
England	LOCATION	were not coolly indifferent , but that in reality they desired the disruption of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was this that rankled , and made the Americans quick to interpret the '' cold neutrality '' of
Great Britain	LOCATION	as in reality an unfriendly neutrality .

		When , in the later years of the war , and after , the North understood that the great mass of the people of
England	LOCATION	had sympathized with her cause , the bitterness gradually disappeared .

		Viewed from the purely English standpoint , it is no doubt correct to discuss the foreign policy of the
United States	LOCATION	during the Civil War in the light of those specific incidents that were in controversy .

		From the American viewpoint , however , as also from that of general history , the foreign relations were vital when they revealed the attitude of foreign nations ; and our later policy for a succeeding score of years was determined by our understanding of what that general attitude had been , rather than by any be - lief that we had been right in specific instances , like those of the `` Trent '' or the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	. ''

		The chapter just noted is brief , however , and has no essential relation to the bulk of the volume .

		In general , '' The Latest Age `` covers the period from
1865	DATE	to the present time , the exact opening date varying with the different countries and topics .

		About half of the twenty - six chapters are given to European states , half to European colonies ,
Latin America	LOCATION	, and the Far East .

		Nearly every chapter bears the stamp of exact and scholarly authority , though many of the writers are comparatively unknown in this country .

		In the preface , the editors profess that so modern a period of history lends itself with the greatest difficulty to that '' intelligible perspective '' which is necessary in order to depict the central threads the unity of the historical movement .

		As has been said , either the editors or their contributors have overcome the difficulty with greater suc - cess than in the earlier volumes .

		For throughout the eight hundred pages of text there run three main ideas characteristic of the period : first , progress toward national consciousness and na - tional ideals ; second , the advance of democracy and of parliamentary government ; third , the development of an international code of law and of permanent international tribunals .

		These matters appear not merely as separated sub - jects for discussion ; they inevitably appear in what professes to be a description of events within a particular state .

		In a most interest - ing chapter , for example , by Professor
Oncken	PERSON	-LRB- not one of the unfamiliar specialists -RRB- , on the German Empire , the development of national consciousness is insisted on ; indirect argument is advanced as to the effectiveness which may be expected from parliamentary or from irre - sponsible government ; and , finally , the German disinclination to become enthusiastic over schemes of world-arbitration is forcibly stated .

		For the British reader , no doubt , Professor
Oncken	PERSON	's analysis of the tendency of modern German world-policy will be of most interest .

		He traces with admirable clearness the evolu - tion of those industrial conditions which have placed upon
Germany	LOCATION	the necessity of an expan - sion that is distinctly economic .

		In this evolu - tion ,
William II	PERSON	.

		is credited with prescience , and with having given the initial impulse in each step taken to advance the industrial re - quirements of his people .

		The rapid increasing of the navy was but to safeguard the commer - cial and colonial interests of the state , and was intended rather as a means of defense than for aggression .

		The gradual drifting apart of
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, followed by the extreme British fear of
Germany	LOCATION	, was the inevitable consequence of the latter 's appearance in the field of international commerce and of world politics .

		Professor
Oncken	PERSON	maintains that
Germany	LOCATION	's `` world policy '' is essentially and wholly economic ; that it is in no sense aggres - sive to the point of armed conflict ; that Ger - many 's interests demand rather that the world should remain at peace , and that her military and naval strength tend to this end .


England	LOCATION	, he asserts , is now coming to understand this ; but he also states with emphasis in his con - cluding paragraph that
Germany	LOCATION	is united in the determination to participate in the modern international economic development , and also united in the belief that in her ability to defend herself lies her only security .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, Thus , Professor
Oncken	PERSON	indirectly states
Germany	LOCATION	's attitude toward the world peace movement .

		In chapter XXII. , on '' The Modern Law of Nations and the Prevention of War , '' Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	discusses the broader aspects of the question .

		The treat - ment is purely historical , but throughout it is demonstrated that the entire process of cre - ating a body of rules or customs known as international law has consisted in creating a sentiment so strong that nations hesitated to violate it .

		Reason and custom gradually estab - lished rules of action which were observed even if not enforced .

		It follows that it is as reasonable to expect ultimately a general acquiescence in arbitration , as in the past it seemed reasonable to expect the adoption of many rules of inter - national conduct now generally observed .

		The author declares that '' the frequent repetition of declarations that war ought not to be entered on without a serious attempt at conciliation in some form ... does tend to produce , and may in time produce , a genuine public opinion capable of affording a considerable moral sanction . ''

		And again : '' As time goes on , it will be less and less reputable among civilized states to talk of going to war without having exhausted the re - sources of the Hague Convention . ''

		This chap - ter illustrates the distinctly modern character of the volume .

		In most cases , events are carried to the year
1910	DATE	; and while earlier volumes may with some truth have been criticised as prima - rily valuable for the historical student , this con - cluding volume is certainly fitted for a wider usefulness .

		A public interested in the social , intellectual , or scientific trend , in the progress of ideas as well as of nations , in economic as well as political history , finds here authoritative information upon matters still vaguely under - stood or incorrectly presented in current print .

		Chapter and page headings are inviting and stimulating for casual reading , and add greatly to convenience for easy reference .

		Such topics as `` The Reform Movement in
Russia	LOCATION	, '' carried up to the midsummer of
1909	DATE	, `` The Regeneration of
Japan	LOCATION	'' to the treaty of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, ''
Sven Hedin	PERSON	'' and '' Exploration in Thibet , '' '' The Development of
Western Canada	LOCATION	, '' '' The Rev - olution in Social Ideas , '' '' Thermo-dyn arnica !

		Research , '' indicate in a measure the breadth of ground covered , and bear out the statement in the preface that '' We are , in many ways , more amply instructed about our own time than we are in the affairs of any other age . ''

		And , indeed , in a reconsideration and summary of the entire work , it is not too much to say that the editors and contributors have in large part realized their ideals .

		These may not be quite
Lord Acton	PERSON	's ideals , but it is doubtful , indeed , if these were actually realizable .

		The ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	`` is of distinct value as an historical product .

		It speaks with authority , and usually justly .

		Its excellence is in its exactness , its tone of scholarship , and in the non-controversial character of its contributions .

		THE CASE OF MARY Influenced , perhaps , by my own knowledge ,
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	has seemed to me a notable character in the world 's history , whose true personal and social position it has been difficult to assign .

		She challenged attention in both relations , but left us the not easy task of forming at once a kindly and safe judgment of opinions and actions which could not be otherwise than widely influential for good and for evil on the world at large .

		While the author of the most recent book on this remark - able woman helps us on the biographical side of his subject , his work can hardly be called a social study .

		The life of
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	was com - paratively brief .

		She was born in
1759	DATE	and died in
1797	DATE	.

		She belonged by birth to the middle classes , to whom the blessings of life come ill liberal measure , and are held back only by light exactions .

		This position of com - fort was lost to her by the faults of her father , and she was forced to early makeshifts to teaching , and finally to literary labor as a means of subsistence .

		She was generous toward her kindred and friends , but felt keenly the pressure under which her life was developed .

		Her general attitude and tendencies were chiefly expressed in her '' Vindication of the Rights of Women , '' a companion volume to her ``
Vindi	PERSON	- cation of the Rights of Men , '' which together formed her chief literary works .

		She saw clearly the unfavorable features in the position of women , and resented them as needless in - flictions and injustice .

		She did not see with equal distinctness , or feel with equal acuteness , the half-blind circumstances out of which these difficulties arise .

		THE DIAL 77 inevitable and useful .

		The problem is ex - pounded by them , and finally brought to a solution .

		They are only to be removed by a better perception of our nature , and a clearer recognition of that which is right .


Mary Wollstonecraf	PERSON	t was the declared enemy of pres - ent conditions to such a degree as to blind her to the slow changes by which they are to be remoyed .

		This intellectual antagonism was the chief feature of her life , and by means of it she lost much of that patience and concession which should go with reform .

		She found it difficult to bear the hardships of evil ; she did not feel their necessity .

		The earlier work , ''
Vindica	PERSON	- tion of the Rights of Men , '' sprang out of the same spirit .

		It was written in answer to the reflections of
Edmund Burke	PERSON	on the French Revolution .

		Both books have a legitimate side , and both are excessive .

		When we look at the violence of the Revolution , we are liable , with
Burke	PERSON	, to be horrified by the results , and to shrink entirely back from the evils and the malign forces disclosed in them .

		This was not the attitude of
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	.

		To her mind , it belonged to men , and to the rights of men , to resent the wrongs to which they had been so long and so forgetfully exposed .

		If
Burke	PERSON	's opinion was the conservative English view , her feeling was equally implanted in the dark history of men .

		To her clearness of intellectual apprehension and independence of thought ,
Mary Wollstone	PERSON	- craft added lively affections affections , not passions .

		The two aided each other .

		She had a dignified reserve which prevented any waste and prostitution of feeling , and enabled her to hold the position which her vigor of thought assigned her .

		There was no trailing of gar - ments in the dust .

		These endowments of the intellectual and spiritual nature rendered her attitude always commanding .

		In a brief life and a brief period she went through three experiences which the unkindly critic might easily call amours .

		The first was in connection with
Henry Fusch	PERSON	, a married man of fascinating social qualities .

		It could hardly be said to have put any strain upon her character , since , antici - pating its strength , she retired from
London	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The second attachment , in which she most overpassed conventional bounds and the safeguards of her own character , occurred in
Paris	LOCATION	in her association with Captain
Gilbert Imlay	PERSON	.

		She was formally registered as his wife at the
American Embassy	ORGANIZATION	, though without marriage .

		Imlay seemed to share her opinions , though it is hardly uncharitable to think that his passions took the lead of his judgment .

		He was the object of intense affection , debasing in its persistency , and from which he escaped by simple satiety .

		Certainly none of the conven - tional restraints of a legal union could have been more at war with independence and personal dignity than this desertion of an unfaithful companion proved to be .

		In casting aside the customs with which society seeks to protect itself from unmeasured evils , she fell into dis - asters not inferior to those which accompany .

		ill-assorted unions .

		Within the record of her own experience she met the most manifest dis - proof of the opinions which gave rise to it .

		At the close of this period of wandering in dark - ness , she fell in with
Godwin	PERSON	, much the truest of her friends .

		A real and permanent concur - rence of opinion drew them together .

		They maintained unbroken that dependence and inde - pendence which both recognized as involving the highest personal relation .

		They occupied separate quarters , and were not formally mar - ried , until the anticipation of the birth of a child created a duty which had not been sufficient to control interests which rested on themselves alone .

		This child ,
Mary	PERSON	, the second daughter of
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	, became the wife of Shelley .

		Her mother died in giving her birth .

		Here we have the problem made up : the claims of society as opposed to those of personal liberty .

		We certainly can not regard the actual issue as an opportune and happy one .

		We are compelled , rather , to search for the error which gave rise to it .

		A reasonable estimate of fine personal qualities may call for leniency but can not hide the social danger .

		This danger is one of constant recurrence , with every degree of debasement , and can not be thrust aside .

		No matter in what way we put and answer per - sonal questions , they do not cover the ground .

		The social problem remains as the chief con - sideration .

		What does the welfare of society call for ?

		If we do not wish , like
Simeon	PERSON	the Stylite the wonder and the mockery of many ages to mount some column of fame and of infamy , we must reconcile our own excellence with the excellence of the world .

		These two elements of superiority the personal and the collective are inseparable from each other .

		Even the pebbles on the seashore owe their shapely quality to their constant collision with each other .

		The social element is the most comprehensive and immediately powerful , the individual element the most conspicuous and qualitative .

		The individual makes plain the wealth of the community , and the community 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, gives the position to which the individual attains .

		The susceptibilities of growth are in the persona -RSB- consciousness ; but , as in the buds of a tree , they are lifted into eminence by the collective action .

		It belongs to the individual to see what is good , and to pursue it under the conditions assigned by society .

		Men are constantly making errors in their social theories by supposing that they can work some social improvement by a mechanical change .

		The Socialist thinks that if he could be allowed to set right the forms of society , its tick and stroke would at once be regular .

		A spirit is in all living things and must precede their movement .

		The fatal miscarriage in the case before us and it was fatal lay in the supposition that in independence in the pursuit of good was found the law of life .

		Not so ; we are bound to the law of obedience and suffering in the community , bearing with us the better opinion .

		The weak of a marching army may be terribly overwrought ; but the question remains , shall the army be halted to nurse its invalids ?

		St.
Paul	PERSON	speaks of the undergirding of the ship in which he was driven on the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		We may think this undergirding a very feeble device ; yet as long as our naval architecture calls for this form of relief , we must allow the undergirded vessels to creep into port .

		The sex relation is fundamental in human life .

		Great good and great evil arise from it .

		There is no end to the failures that are trace - able to it , as there is no end to the inspirations that are associated with it .

		We must accept these facts , nor suppose that by any contriv - ance of our own we can , in the midst of men and women , escape danger .

		The whole human problem is upon us , and the experience and safeguards of ages are not too many for its solution .

		One can regret the nobility of char - acter which seems to have been submerged in the life of
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	, and yet hold only the more closely to the awkward means of escape which men have set up .

		REFORMERS OF THE FRONTIER .

		* One of the most discouraging facts , to those whose faith is nailed to the mast of democratic government , has been the apathy of the people in face of conditions that tend to nothing short of anarchy .

		One of the most encouraging signs of the times is the practical heroism of FREEBOOTERS OF THE WILDERNESS .

		By
Agnes Laut	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the little band of reformers , out on the Western frontier , fighting on the one hand the tremen - dous forces arrayed against democracy , and 011 the other the stolid indifference of the masses .

		These men have been branded , by friend and foe alike , as hysterical cranks ; but so has every reformer in every age .

		These cranks of to-day do not offer theories ; they present facts , cold indisputable facts , facts that put democracy on trial , facts that force the issue , Is government by and for the people to live or to die ?

		They have proved the existence of powerful interests fattening upon the people , interests that for years have been engaged in a wholesale plun - dering of the forest and mineral wealth of the country , that have even stooped to murder to gain their ends , and that have been powerful enough to strangle every attempt at government investigation .

		The mission of these reformers is to bring the men behind these interests to justice , and to awaken the people to the duty of conservation of their national resources .

		Some of the best men in the service of the government are enlisted in this cause , and they have brought to their aid many of the ablest writers of the day .

		The literature of the move - ment is found in government documents , books , pamphlets , and magazine articles ; but probably no more effective means could be devised for driving the facts home to the millions than such a book as Miss
Agnes Laut	PERSON	's '' Freebooters of the Wilderness . ''

		Miss Laut has been in close touch with the men who are leading this patriotic movement , she has had access to the accumulated evidence on which their appeal to the public is based , she has travelled through - out the West studying the actual conditions , and she has crystallized her facts in what is nominally a novel but is really an acute study of one of the biggest problems of the day .

		Many who would never think of studying the less popular discussions of the subject will be brought to a realization of the startling con - victions set forth with such dramatic power in these pages .

		Every essential fact in the book , and this can be said without reservation , is supported by the evidence of men whose word can not be disputed .

		The murder of the boy
Ford Williams	ORGANIZATION	is but a thinly disguised version of what actually happened in the
West	LOCATION	; so is the shooting of
MacDonald	ORGANIZATION	the sheep rancher .

		Says
Wayland	LOCATION	, the Forest Ranger : '' It was preposterous , unbelievable , like a page from the lawlessness of the frontier a hundred years ago !

		Yet had n't this thing happened in
California	LOCATION	, and hap - pened in
Alaska	LOCATION	?

		They would never dare to murder a man conducting an investigation ordered by the great

		THE DIAL 79 government of the .

		greatest nation on earth !

		Yet had they not tried to assassinate representatives of the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	government in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and shot to death in
Colorado	LOCATION	a Federal officer sent straight from
Washington	LOCATION	?

		And these murders had not been committed by the rabble , by the demagogues , by the anarchists .

		They had been pre-planned and carried out by the vested-righter , in defiance of law , in defi - ance of the strongest government on earth ; and , up to the present , in defiance of retribution . ''

		Here , to be more explicit , are the actual facts in the Tensleep case in
Wyoming	LOCATION	: In the
spring of 1909	DATE	, the cattlemen of the No Wood Country , in
Big Horn County	LOCATION	,
Wyoming	LOCATION	, re - sented the action of the sheepmen in bringing sheep across their cow-range in order to get into the sheep-range .

		It appears that , several years before , the stockmen got together and established lines between the cattle and sheep ranges , which were commonly designated as `` dead-lines . ''

		These lines were respected by the sheepmen until the general conditions gradually changed , and it became necessary for the sheepmen using the
Spring Creek	ORGANIZATION	range to cross a small portion of the cow ter - ritory in order to reach their early range .

		This they did , going to the range they had formerly used unmolested .

		Shortly after , seven cattlemen running cattle in the vicinity formed a posse , swept down on the sheep camp in the
night	TIME	, and opened fire on the tents , killing the sheepmen
Joseph Emge	PERSON	and
Joseph Allemand	PERSON	, as well as a poor herder , without giving them any opportunity to explain or correct their actions , if any injustice had been committed .

		After killing the sheepmen , the cattlemen piled up their tents over the bodies and burned them .

		The sheepmen and cattlemen lived in the same vicinity , and had previous to this accepted each other 's hospitalities , making the murder all the more cold-blooded .

		The scene of the murder is about ten miles south of the
Big Horn National Forest on Spring Creek	ORGANIZATION	, a tri - butary of the No
Wood Creek	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a bald narrative of the facts .

		The cattlemen were brought to trial , through the efforts of the
Reform Party	ORGANIZATION	in
Wyoming	LOCATION	, and in spite of the determined efforts of the cattle interests were convicted and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment .

		The significant feature of the case is that it constitutes the first and only conviction for range murders in the
West	LOCATION	.

		In face of such facts as these , is there any further need to justify the men on the firing-line who have been fighting the tools of the Freebooters , and are now going for the Men Higher Up ?

		Biographical Edition of

Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, is entitled `` Lay Morals , and Other Papers , '' and is provided with a preface by Mrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	and a few explanatory notes by Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	.

		The preface relates the circumstances attending the production of that fiery Philippic against the traducer of Father
Damien	PERSON	which the hotly indig - nant writer caused to be printed at his own expense and at the risk of prosecution for libel .

		`` This is a serious affair , '' the lawyer consulted beforehand had said after reading the paper ; '' however , no one will publish it for you . ''

		Its rather unnecessarily passionate language seems to have called forth no rejoinder or other demonstration from the Rev. Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	of
Honolulu	LOCATION	, to whom the `` open letter '' was formally addressed .

		A fine exhibition of right - eous indignation one must call it , even though too lavish of rhetorical pyrotechnics and much in need of the calm revision its author afterward regretted not having given it .

		The `` Lay Morals '' and many of the other pieces in the volume are early and un - finished productions , some of them first printed in `` The
Edinburgh University Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, '' and some never before put into type .

		As might have been expected , there is in most of them more manner than matter , the writer being at that time engaged in that laborious forming of his style which he has elsewhere told his readers about in some detail .

		As a good example of the young stylist 's dexterity , we quote from '' The Philosophy of Umbrellas '' a typical passage : `` Except in a very few cases of hypocrisy joined to a powerful intellect , men , not by nature umbrellarians , have tried again and again to become so by art , and yet have failed have expended their patrimony in the purchase of um - brella after umbrella , and yet have systematically lost them , and have finally , with contrite spirits and shrunken purses , given up their vain struggle , and relied on theft and borrowing for the remainder of their lives . ''

		Three beginnings of stories or novels , of later authorship , conclude the volume .

		As illus - trating the author 's growth in freedom and origin - ality , and in the fuller mastery of his craft , the book is a welcome supplement to the more impor - tant volumes that have gone before .

		The sub-title '' and other Hints to Men and Women '' forbids it .

		The profit of the exercise , however , does not interfere with the varied pleasures of the stroll .

		In `` The Intellectuals '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- C .

		anon
Sheehan	PERSON	has 8U < '' e * ded in giving animation and something of dramatic interest to various disquisitions and de - bates that might otherwise have proved too heavy and dull for enjoyable hot-weather reading .

		His sub-title , `` An Experiment in Irish Club-Life , '' indicates at the outset that dialogue rather than monologue is to be the form adopted in the pages that follow .

		Ten congenial spirits are brought together under the lead of one Father
Dillon	PERSON	of
Cork	ORGANIZATION	, for the purpose of good talk and a little occa - sional music and poetry .

		As both Catholics and Protestants , both men and women , and various pro- fessions and occupations , are represented in the club -LRB- which calls itself by a Greek name , the '' Sunetoi , '' which a footnote translates as the Esoterics , or the Select -RRB- , there is of necessity , and by common con - sent , the largest degree of tolerance and liberality in its choice of topics for discussion and in its inter - change of views on those topics .

		Almost anything of interest to a person of education and refinement seems to be open for good-natured and never prolonged debate at the sessions of the club , thirty - seven of which are reported by the author .

		The thirty-seventh and last takes the form of a picnic , at which the founder delivers a valedictory address , congratulating his fellow-members on the perfect success of their experiment , and continuing : '' We have gone over the entire field of human thought ; discussed poetry , philosophy , metaphysics , medicine , education , religion , and even politics ; and we have not had so much as a breeze to ruffle our tempers and make us regret entering on such an engagement . ''

		From the same broad-minded and wholesomely stimulating speaker -LRB- whom one can not but identity more or less closely with the author -RRB- we select another pregnant utterance . '

		Speaking of ideals , is it not characteristic of our age , and somewhat saddening , that the terrible realism of our novelists gives no chance to the young to see , and understand , what heroism is ?

		... But considering the enor - mous importance of the modern novel as a factor in human enlightenment and progress , I think it is deplorable that our writers seem to have put aside all the old chivalrous models , and given us only the squalid side of humanity in their little ` slices of life . ' ''

		One finds in the book a good deal said on both sides and all sides of a good many questions , so that it is only by conjecture one can arrive at the author 's own mind in the matter .

		But every argument and every remark throws light and is a welcome contribution to the lively but earnest dis - cussion .

		The
Canon	ORGANIZATION	's closing words to his preface -LRB- which of course was written last -RRB- thus refer to his book and its aims : `` If it will help to show that there are really no invincible antagonisms amongst the people who make up the commonwealth of
Ireland	LOCATION	, no mutual repugnances that may not be removed by freer and kindlier intercourse with each other , he will be sufficiently rewarded . ''

		The occasional poems , mostly original with the members of the club , that diversify its deliberations , add to the high lit - erary quality of this report of its proceedings .

		A wise and witty T .

		hat agreeable French writer who French woman 's signs herself ''
Pierre de Coulevain	PERSON	, '' views ofEnaiand .

		and whose nove i s > American
Nobil	PERSON	- ity , '' '' Eve Triumphant , '' and '' On the Branch , '' have enjoyed a vogue extending beyond the bounds of her own country , has made another successful appeal to both the English-reading and the French - reading public in her book on English life and English people which , with a frank recognition of French prejudice and French devotion to the things that are French , she has entitled `` The Unknown Isle '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		But the narrowness and exclusive - ness she has found to be by no means all on one side of the Channel .

		The English stand in as much need of this shrewdly discerning but always kind - hearted scrutiny of their insular peculiarities as do the French of a fuller and more sympathetic acquaintance with their Anglo-Saxon neighbors .

		The book , well translated by Miss
Alys Hallard	PERSON	, describes a three-months ' sojourn among friends in
England	LOCATION	, about one half the time being spent in the country and the other half in
London	LOCATION	.

		Both the charm of the English country house and the fasci - nation of
London	LOCATION	in the gay season are conveyed to the reader , but with a plentiful admixture of comment and criticism and of suggestion as to pos - sible improvement in the conventions and institu - tions of
John Bull	PERSON	and his family . ''

		However com - fortable and however luxurious the English home may be , '' she says , '' it is always cold .

		Their snob - bish decorum insists on a discipline which is too
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 81 strict and too uniform .

		It puts a damper on gaiety , it makes conversation heavy and commonplace , it prevents the exteriorization of the sentiments and transforms the domestics into automata . ''

		The in - nate snobbishness of the Briton more than once excites in her a feeling of mingled amusement and tolerant contempt .

		The essentially masculine char - acter of the northern peoples , as contrasted with the feminine nature of the Latin races , she finds typified in
London	LOCATION	, which she calls '' Anglo-Saxon , masculine , and Protestant , '' while
Paris	LOCATION	is '' Latin .

		feminine , and Catholic . ''

		The author saw something of American women in
England	LOCATION	, and she shrewdly notes their peculiarities . ''

		These Anglo-Saxon half - sisters , '' she believes , '' do not care much for each other , and they understand each other still less .

		The elder sister , unconsciously perhaps , envies the younger one her chic , her brilliant beauty , her dainty hands and feet , her independence , and , above all , her dollars .

		The younger sister envies the elder one her distinction , her parchments , and her tradi - tions . ''

		In accounting for the lack of cordiality between the French and the English , the writer seems not to penetrate to the root of the matter in asserting that '' mutual ignorance , as regards lan - guage , is the cause of all the misunderstandings between
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	and
Madame	ORGANIZATION	la
France	LOCATION	. ''

		She was getting nearer this cause in pointing out the marked difference in temperament -LRB- one masculine , the other feminine -RRB- between the two peoples . ''

		The Unknown Isle , '' which is said to have passed through a hundred and twelve editions -LRB- 112,000 copies -RRB- in its French form , is by all means the book to read if one desires a near and not unfriendly and also clear - sighted view of our masterful cousins across the water .

		A handbook of great glaciers of the world .

		Much .

		has been written for the American student about glaciation -RCB- n general , and about the extinct Pleistocene ice-sheet that once covered the conti - nent .

		The phenomena of the drift have been de - scribed in much detail .

		In technical journals there have also been numerous articles descriptive of the Alaskan and Cordilleran glaciers , as well as of the
Greenland	LOCATION	ice-sheet .

		It must be admitted , how - ever , that of books available to the general public there are few coming from authoritative sources .

		Those that are in circulation are devoted more to past than present glaciation .

		Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	's work on '' Characteristics of Existing Glaciers '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covers a field previously unoccupied .

		In a single volume he has described the salient fea - tures of existing glaciers , and attempted to answer a few of the questions that come up in the minds of everyone who for the first time stands before one of the great ice-streams .

		In the effort to cover so large a field in a single book , the author has neces - sarily been restricted in his selections , and many readers will feel that their own particular field of interest is but scantily served .

		The Sierran glaciers , for example , come in for but few words , and fewer still are devoted to those of
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , a large amount of space is devoted to
Antarctica	LOCATION	a proceeding perhaps justified by the mass of new data at hand .

		The book is frankly a compilation and systemization of existing data , though the work follows the author 's personal studies of many of the types he defines .

		To stu - dents , the chief value of the book will lie in the bibliography , and in the completeness with which recent European studies in particular have been summarized .

		No attempt need be made here to indicate those points upon which Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	's interpretations are likely to be challenged by spe - cialists .

		It is sufficient to say that he has stated his views with due reservation , and that none are so strikingly different from current doctrine as to be apt to provoke general controversy .

		To the layman , the book will be even more valuable as being practically the only one to which he can turn for general information on its subject .

		This will make him the more willing to excuse the condensa - tion , to point of dryness , that marks much of the work , and the rather frequent assumption of prior knowledge quite beyond any but specialists .

		The particularly full account of Antarctic conditions is much the best summary yet published .

		The book is lavishly illustrated and well printed .

		The scheme of placing references at the end of the chapters , however excellent in theory -LRB- and as to that there are two opinions -RRB- , makes their use exceedingly inconvenient in practice .

		The latest volume in the '' South .

		American Series '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is de - voted to that most important and yet least known of antipodal republics ,
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		Its ex - tent is so vast , its natural features are so diverse , its economic and commercial interests are so broken up into special interests , that it has not been pos sible for any one man to know modern
Brazil	LOCATION	, much less attempt to portray it to the reading public .

		Moreover , it is only in recent years that thanks to the labors of Dr.
Oswaldo Cruz	PERSON	and of the hy - gienic institute founded in his honor modern sani - tation has added
Rio Janeiro	LOCATION	to the list of civilized cities .

		M.
Pierre Denis	PERSON	has attempted the ambi - tious task of encompassing an adequate portrayal of this the greatest of South American republics within the compass of a single volume .

		The translation , copious annotations , and an historical chapter , are from the pen of Mr.
Bernard Miall	PERSON	, a well-informed and competent authority ; and a supplementary chapter upon the mineral resources is from an equally competent authority , Mr.
D. A. Vindin	PERSON	.

		The work is amply illustrated by photographs of city and country life , and by three large maps .

		The author 's point of view is mainly economic and commercial .

		He evidently writes from a wide acquaintance with those forces and features of Brazilian life which have to do with the creation and distribution of wealth .

		Natural features of the country , its great resources , developed but feebly as 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, yet ; the native , the ex-slave , and the immigrant elements of the population ; the labor supply , the small landowner ; roads and railroads ; coffee , mate '' , and rubber ; the excessively and absurdly high protective tariff ; the tremendous financial experi - ment which the state is making in attempting to maintain the high price of coffee by buying the surplus crops , all these matters interest him and are interpreted in the language of the mart .

		More - over , his approach is Gallic and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	rather than Anglo-Saxon and American .

		The author 's account of the Portuguese and Italian and German elements in forming the Brazilian people is illumi - nating and critical .

		The Pan-Germanist will find little comfort in his cool dismissal of the fond illu - sion that the German colonists in
Brazil	LOCATION	retain any political loyalty to the fatherland , though the author concedes the results of the Brazilian govern - ment 's policy of concentration of nationalities in perpetuating the national characteristics of the im - migrant .

		For the student of politics , Spanish - American history , economics , commerce , and social conditions of
Tropical America	LOCATION	,
M. Denis	PERSON	's work will be indispensable .

		It will be natural that all good En - A nonexistent glighmen should wign to be pogted prmcipahtv .

		, .

		on the pedigree of their Queen and the history of her country ; and accordingly Mr.
Baring-Gould	PERSON	's beautifully illustrated and gossipy account of `` The Land of
Teck	ORGANIZATION	and Its Neighbor - hood '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , supplied as it is with a fine family tree in addition , will appeal to them .

		By attaching the interesting historical neighbors of Hohenstaufen ,
Reutlingen	LOCATION	, and
Hohenzollern	ORGANIZATION	, material enough has been gathered to make a hand - some and well - printed volume of over 300 pages .

		It is not difficult to compile such a book , so far as the text is concerned , for critical judgment has not been called into play .

		At least carelessness in the spelling of German names should have been avoided , as Htttten for
Hutten	PERSON	; and half-English , half - German forms .

		Aside from the family history of
Queen Mary	ORGANIZATION	, which is full enough and doubtless accurate , the chief value of the book is its fifty - three illustrations , five of them color portraits .

		It is only by inference that one learns that there really is no Land of
Teck	ORGANIZATION	, nor has been for several hun - dred years .

		The Duchy of
Teck	ORGANIZATION	, or Principality of
Teck	ORGANIZATION	, is an honorary degree in nobility .

		One may fairly commend the barehandedness with which the author treats the character of many of the Queen 's remoter ancestors .

		The
United State	ORGANIZATION	, We are g lad to see that the various from
Washington	LOCATION	volumes of Dr.
Elroy M. Avery	PERSON	s to
Jefferson	LOCATION	.

		History of the
United States	LOCATION	and Its People '' -LRB-
Burrows Bros.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Co. -RRB- are following each other in quick succession , especially as these later volumes are fully maintaining the exception - ally high standard reached by the earlier ones .

		The seventh volume , which has recently appeared , deals with the period from
1788	DATE	to
1806	DATE	, thus covering the years of
Washington	LOCATION	's presidency with all the difficulties that confronted it in the organiza - tion of the government ,
John Adams	PERSON	's unfortunate single term , and as much of
Jefferson	PERSON	's double term as would provide the reader with an adequate basis for a right understanding of what will have to be the burden of volume eight the War of
1812	DATE	.

		As if conscious of the fact that other phases of his - tory besides the military are demanding attention to-day , Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has given a great deal of space to economic development , to the westward move - ment , and to modes and expenses of travel .

		If at times he has adhered a little too closely and con - tinuously to Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's views , he has produced a narrative that is vastly entertaining , and one that , at least in its main features , is thoroughly reliable .

		The illustrations in this volume are an attractive feature .

		They include broadsides , auto - graphs , contemporary caricatures , title-pages of famous publications , portraits of prominent men , representations of the dress , furniture , and cooking utensils of the period , of inventions and of buildings , facsimiles of passports , of paper money , and of leg - islative enactments , to say nothing of the maps , which are , as usual , a most valuable asset in them - selves .

		The appendices of this volume embrace such documents as the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	and the rough draft of
Washington	LOCATION	's
Farewell Address	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the customary bibliography .

		Talks about ^ ~ * ^ e i ncreas i n g number of books some great about composers is added a chatty composers .

		gossiping volume by
J. Cuthbert Hadden	PERSON	-LRB- '' Master Musicians , ''
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		No fear of technicalities will deter the sum - mer reader who will pick this book up for an idle hour , and who will not be disappointed .

		The book is little more than a canto of anecdotes which have gathered about the great names in music , with the proper filling of high-flown raptures about the best - known symphonies , operas , and quartettes .

		Of critical appreciation there is none ; the writer 's human sympathies are his guide in each case .

		All this is practically admitted in the brief preface ; and the sub-title explains that the book is '' for players , singers , and listeners , '' necessarily amateurs .

		A score or more of the great composers , from
Handel	LOCATION	to Tschaikowsky , are given the setting of their times and manners ; and some of the minor ones -LRB- called , not quite excusably , '' stars among the planets '' -RRB- are given in sketchy outline .

		The book is admirably printed , and is enriched with fifteen idealized por - traits , reproduced from the
Hanfstaengl	PERSON	collection .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The latest translator of the `` Iliad '' is Mr.
Arthur Gardner Lewis	PERSON	, who gives us a blank verse reproduction of the entire epic . ''

		The absolutely ideal translation of Houier will never be written , '' says Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	, claiming no more for his own than is implied in his suggestion that '' each new attempt may contribute a little new
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 truth , a little added beauty , just a new felicitous touch here and there , which shall be characteristic and all its own . ''

		That the translator has lived up to this modest ideal may fairly be allowed , for his version is pleasing to the ear throughout its even course .

		The work is , in a sense , a
Chicago	LOCATION	product , being dedicated to two mas - ters in the
Chicago	LOCATION	school which fitted the translator for
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is published -LRB- two volumes in one -RRB- by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are not sure that we agree with Miss
Dolores Bacon	PERSON	in the composition of her list of '' Operas that Every Child Should Know , '' and think that such works as '' Carmen '' and '' The Damnation of Faust '' might better have been omitted , but the idea of the book is an admirable one .

		It tells the stories , and illustrates the music with examples in notation .

		Eighteen operas altogether are summarized .

		The book is published by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Inland Voyage '' and `` Donkey '' seem to be very popular with teachers of English , if we may judge from the numerous school editions that have been published of late years .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us the newest of these , edited by Dr.
Louis Franklin Snow	PERSON	.

		In the same series of '' Standard English Classics '' we also have '' Treasure Island , '' edited by Mr.
F.W. C. Hersey	PERSON	, and a welcome little book of `` Selections from Huxley , '' edited by Mr
John S. Gushing	PERSON	.

		`` Old Testament Narratives , '' selected and edited for school use by Professor
Edward Chauncey Baldwin	PERSON	, is a publication of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text , un - fortunately , is that of the modern American revision .

		For this reason , we must give the preference to Presi - dent
Henry Nelson Snyder	PERSON	's similar volume , based upon the Authorized Version -LRB- the only translation that should ever be thought of for literary study -RRB- , entitled '' Selections from the Old Testament , '' and published by
Messrs. Giun & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		To write a simple text-book of metrical rhetoric for the beginner has been the purpose of Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	in preparing '' A Study of Versification , '' now published by the
Houghton Miffliu Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is based upon the sound principle '' that all poetry is to be said or sung , and that its appeal is to the ear and not to the eye ... No other principle is even discussed , and all controversy has been rigorously eschewed . ''

		The author 's treatment of his subject is not only instructive , but also fresh and readable . ''

		Classical Rome '' and ''
Christian Rome	PERSON	, '' the former by Mr.
H. Stuart Jones	PERSON	, and the latter by Messrs.
J. W. and A. M. Cruickshank	PERSON	, are new volumes of `` Grant
Allen	PERSON	's Historical Guides , '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		These books offer a case of the good , not the evil , that men do living after them , for they are admirably compact and helpful volumes .

		The popular '' Satchel Guide to
Europe	LOCATION	'' is now sent us by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and has reached its fortieth annual edition .

		The death of Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	will make it necessary to find a new editor for this useful publication , but his ideas , like those of
Grant Allen	PERSON	, are likely to be perpetuated .

		All Baedekers are interesting , but the latest of them `` The Mediterranean '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is perhaps the most fascinating of the entire series .

		Here the reader may journey in imagination to
Lisbon	LOCATION	and the Portuguese coast , to
Madeira	LOCATION	and the Canaries , to
Gibraltar	LOCATION	and
Morocco	LOCATION	, to
Algiers	LOCATION	and
Tunis	LOCATION	, to
Alex	PERSON	- andria ,
Athens	LOCATION	, and
Constantinople	LOCATION	, and up into the Black Sea .

		Most of the material is rearranged from the other Baedekers , but a great deal of it is absolutely new . '

		NOTES . ''

		An Anthology of Modern English Prose '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , edited by Miss
Annie Barnett	PERSON	and
Miss Lucy Dale	PERSON	, both of them experienced compilers of text-books for English schools , covers the period from
Richardson	PERSON	to
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Upwards of fifty authors are represented , mostly by selections long enough to be worth while .

		A little book published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	gives us the `` Three Middle English Romances '' of `` King Horn , '' '' Havelok , '' and ''
Bevis of Hampton	PERSON	, '' retold in modern English by Miss
Laura A. Hibbard	PERSON	.

		Another volume in the same form is Miss
Laura McCracken	PERSON	's `` A Page of Forgotten History , '' which retells the story of that
Vittoria Accoramboni	PERSON	whom
Webster	PERSON	immortalized .

		Professor
J. D. M. Ford	PERSON	's '' Old Spanish Readings '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- is intended to be an introduction to a scientific study of the origin and growth of the Spanish language , and to provide , at the same time , an excursus through the more important phases of the literature of
Spain	LOCATION	from the twelfth to the
fifteenth century	DATE	.

		The appa - ratus is rather elaborate , filling nearly three hundred pages in connection with the seventy pages of text . ''

		The
Concise Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	of Current En - glish '' is an adaptation , in a single volume of about one thousand pages , of the material collected for the great `` Oxford English Dictionary . ''

		It is , of course , a very small work in comparison with its source , but it pre - sents a surprisingly large amount of matter for the space occupied .

		For this extremely handy and useful book we are indebted to Messrs.
H. W. and F. G. Fowler	PERSON	. ''

		The Annual Library Index '' for
1910	DATE	, issued from the office of '' The Publishers ' Weekly , '' has , besides the features common to previous volumes , a select list of private collectors of books .

		Collections upon special subjects are aimed at , rather than private libraries of a general character .

		The names are classified by States .

		This is only a tentative beginning of what may develop into a valuable guide for both booksellers and students .

		Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	's gift to
Indianapolis	LOCATION	a
$ 75,000	MONEY	site for a new public library speaks well both for the poet 's loyalty toward his home city and for the popularity and success of his poetry .

		As a visible and tangible proof that the love of poetry is not languishing in our day , the
Riley Library	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as one must hope it will be named when erected -RRB- will play a part even more important than that of the ordinary public library , and more important , we may add , than is played by those by-products of steel-manufacture , the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	libraries which so generously and beneficently besprinkle the land .

		The
School of American Archaeology	ORGANIZATION	issues a bulletin outlining its purposes and methods , and briefly indicating the attractions of its coming summer session -LRB- Aug. 1-25 -RRB- in
Santa Fe	LOCATION	and at the adjacent ruins of Pajarito Park .

		The School , a creation of the
Archaeological Institute	ORGANIZATION	, dates from
1907	DATE	, and has its abode in the historic '' Palace of the Governors '' in
Santa Fe	LOCATION	, where it is developing a Museum of
American Archaeology	ORGANIZATION	and starting an archaeological library .

		The nucleus of the latter is the valuable collection of the late Dr.
Franz Nikolaus Finck	PERSON	of the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	, purchased for the School by Mr.
Frank Springer	PERSON	, and soon to be available for use .

		The location of the
School	ORGANIZATION	seems to have been well chosen , being , as the bulletin explains , in the heart of the ancient Pueblo and Cliff Dwelling region , and at the gateway of the rich Mexican field where ancient ruins abound .

		WAR OR PEACE A Present Duty and a Future Hope By General
HIRAM M. CHITTENDEN	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	Is War Necessary ?

		This question is logically and thoroughly discussed by General
H. M. Chittenden	PERSON	in his new book .

		The present-day prominence of the '' universal peace '' move - ment makes this work particularly welcome .

		General
Chittenden	PERSON	is a firm advocate of peace , and his advocacy is made the dominant note in his book .

		But he is also a soldier schooled in the science of war and experienced in its practice .

		By virtue of this training and experience , and the knowledge that man is naturally a fighting animal , he has avoided falling into many of the prevalent mistaken ideas entertained by laymen as to the comparative readiness with which universal peace might by attained , and he therefore confines his remarks to possibilities and cold practical facts .

		He believes that peace will eventually come to all the world .

		110 THE OLD MORALITY .

		We have never been willing to separate art from ethics , or te admit that the one might be independent of the other .

		To our thinking , any art which ignores moral considerations , and still more any art which flouts them as antag - onistic to the freedom of expression , is rotten at the core , however fair its external showing .

		There is , no doubt , a counterfeit bourgeois morality of expediency and deference to irra - tional convention which is fair game for the artist , and which he does well to expose in all its hypocrisy .

		But it is equally fair game for the serious moralist also , who has no greater concern than to make clear the distinction between gold and brummagem .

		In whatever medium the artist work , he is bound to be sin - cere , and whoever is occupied with the artistic expression of life is insincere if he does not recognize the preponderating importance of conduct
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's three-fourths , or something like that fraction .

		Morality has been defined as the nature of things ; and this defi - nition , as profoundly true as it is searching , belongs with no less exactness to art .

		Now there can be no self-contradiction in the nature of things , and the antinomies of the philoso - phers are nothing more than so many hurdles or bunkers , artificial impediments to thought , which can not permanently arrest its progress .

		The sociologist has a good deal to say about the relativity of morals , and delights to show us how practices which we hold in abhorrence may be viewed as sacred rites or duties by other peoples .

		But there is no reason why these con - trasts should make us any less tenacious of what we believe to be the rightful principles of con - duct , or weaken our faith in the moral law which has come to us as the precious nitrate of Hebraic and
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	and Christian teaching .

		We are bound to view the startling instances adduced whether from Thugs or Mormons as perversions of morality and as opposed to the interests of civilization .

		We are bound to do this , that is , unless we hold civilization itself to be a delusion and a mockery , and
Christendom	LOCATION	to rest upon no surer a founda - tion than quicksand .

		If we really do `` count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, child , '' we must have the courage of our con - victions , and stoutly rally to the defence of the tried old moralities whenever they are assailed .

		It is possible that they would lose much of their substance if viewed sub specie ceternitatis , but for the temporal conditions under which we per - force must journey from the cradle to the grave they are the most weighty of realities .

		There is in the trend of modern literature much that is disturbing to those who persist in the old-fashioned habit of viewing its course through moral spectacles .

		It is not merely that the reaction against hypocrisy has gone so far that reticence has ceased to be a virtue ; that is an excess which brings its own cure with the disgust which it ultimately creates , for few readers care to wallow indefinitely in the trough of Zolaism .

		It is rather that all the old prin - ciples of conduct are assailed in the name of a frantic individualism , sometimes in set terms of repudiation , but more often by methods of subtle indirection which unconsciously affect the judg - ment , and dispose it to condone offences which , stripped of their romantic trappings , would be revolting to the moral sense .

		The novelist 's favorite subject for this sophistical treatment is , of course , the sex relation in all its variety of complicated phases , and no irregularity of conduct between men and women escapes being so obscured by sentiment that it becomes impos - sible to view the fundamental moral situation in distinct outline .

		Desertion and divorce , seduc - tion and adultery , are all bedaubed with the same brush , to such an extent that the bewildered reader rubs his eyes , and wonders if the writer has any clear notions of right and wrong , or if the concept of sin has ever had a definite part in his thinking .

		What are grandiosely called '' the rights of the soul '' become a mantle to cover all the wrongs of the sense , and the proverb peccato di carne non e peccato is implicitly assumed to be one of the primary truths of human nature .

		It was this Italian saying , flippantly invoked as an adequate argument against the advocates of such old-fashioned ideals as chastity and fidelity , that only the other day caused `` The Spectator '' to condemn in sweeping terms the tendencies exhibited by one of the ablest of its monthly contemporaries .

		The charge of `` dumping garbage upon the nation 's door - step '' was doubtless too heated to be judicial , and the monthly in question countered effect - ively by printing a list of its contributors a list which was seen to include most of the names of eminence among the English writers of to-day .

		But this reply did not wholly dispose of the accusation , because among these writers , even among the most brilliant of them , there are some whom every reader knows to have done his best , whether in that monthly or else - where , to undermine the props of the social order in the matter of the sex relation , as well as in many other matters .

		This is done speciously , and in the name of some Utopian reconstruction of society planned in a superficially attractive design which does not get much farther than an exhibit of glittering generalities ; but it is nevertheless the underlying aim , and we usually feel , in reading the outpourings of this sort of devil 's advocacy , that the writers would go much farther if they dared .

		Fortunately , there are yet some limits to the daring of '' advanced think - ers '' who use the English language , although there seem to be none that interfere with the freedom of their
Continental	ORGANIZATION	fellow-sappers of the social structure .

		Professor
Bascom	PERSON	, in an article contributed to the last issue of THE DIAL , makes a tem - perate statement of the case which seems to us to embody the last word of wisdom upon the whole subject .

		His specific case is that of
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	, and he says : '' A reasonable estimate of fine personal qualities may call for leniency but can not hide the social danger .

		This danger is one of constant recurrence , with every degree of debasement , and can not be thrust aside .

		No matter in what way we put and answer personal ques - tions , they do not cover the ground .

		The social problem remains as the chief consideration ... The social ele - ment is the most comprehensive and immediately pow - erful , the individual element the most conspicuous and qualitative .

		... It belongs to the individual to see what is good , and to pursue it under the conditions assigned by society ... The fatal miscarriage in the case be - fore us and it was fatal lay in the supposition that in independence in the pursuit of good was found the law of life .

		Not so ; we are bound to the law of obedi - ence and suffering in the community , bearing with us the better opinion . ''

		It is this '' better opinion , '' which no man may lightly contemn , that gives us the touchstone wherewith to test all new substitutes for old principles .

		The freedom which is demanded with so much vehemence by the modern school of individualist writers is almost invariably the freedom to wrong someone else .

		The only free - dom that is salutary and really desirable is that which is found in joyous submission to spiritual law .

		This is the truth which the wisest of men from
Plato	LOCATION	to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	have been preaching to us for more than two thousand years , and the world will work back to it after the present spasm of moral anarchism has demonstrated by exhaustion its own futility and inadequacy .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A MIDSUMMER SUGGESTION TO LIBRARIES may be in order at this time .

		The dull season of sum - mer is commonly and wisely chosen for the annual overhauling , cleaning , refurbishing , and repairing which all public libraries , their books and appli - ances , have to undergo in the perpetual endeavor to withstand the ravages of time and dust , of use and disuse and misuse , of noxious fumes from without or within , and of other disintegrating and destruc - tive agencies .

		College and university libraries especially choose the vacation months for book - dusting and shelf-cleaning , and the muffled bang of the ancient tome , opened to its limit and violently closed again to dislodge the pulverous deposit of the past year , resounds through the deserted alcoves with an incidental dismemberment of many a vener - able volume whose leather binding has been gradu - ally crumbling to the point where none but the reverential touch of the bibliophile can be safely undergone , but where , protected from the profane hands of the cleaner , the book is still good for many years of such service as it is likely to see .

		The sug - gestion is that all libraries adopt the method already employed by not a few that of vacuum-cleaning , which , in celerity , thoroughness , and economy , is vastly superior to the old way .

		If anyone questions this superiority , let him visit the Princeton Uni - versity Library and examine the results there achieved by the vacuum process .

		In fact , almost any well-administered large library can furnish a demonstration .

		THE SHORT ROAD TO A LEARNED DEGREE Seems to be open to all who can pay the toll .

		Of course , rapid transit costs money ; the cannon-ball express calls for a much greater outlay than the accom - modation train .

		And yet the fake colleges and mushroom universities that offer to fit you up with a degree while you wait , turn out the parchments at a very reasonable rate , celerity and range of selec - tion being considered .

		One correspondence school , for instance , offers on reasonable terms to decorate the applicant with any one or more of the following combinations of letters :
B.S.	LOCATION	,
B.A.	LOCATION	, Ph.D. , LL.B. ,
M.S.	LOCATION	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, LL.M. , LL.D. ,
D.D.	LOCATION	, Litt.D. , D.C.L. , Sc.D .

		The
United States Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, through its recently-created
Division of Higher Education	ORGANIZATION	, under the control of Dr.
K. C. Babcock	PERSON	, is bringing to light some queer and interesting institu - tions whose chief if not only functions seem to be the receiving of fees and the issuing of diplomas .

		Among American universities little known but covering an astonishing range of human knowledge with a remarkably small faculty or teaching force , we read of one glorying in the splendid name of
Oriental University	ORGANIZATION	, and having its
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	seat on
Dominion Heights	ORGANIZATION	in the environs of
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		That its professors are broadly educated becomes apparent when one finds the same chair responsible for tuition in such various subjects as odontology , bacteriology , psychotherapy , materia medica , French , and South American Indian lan - guages ; still another entrusted with theologic sym - bolics , philology , and Old English law ; and a third charged with Oriental languages , theomonism , mis - sions , German and Oriental philosophy , and inter - national law .

		Why spend four weary years at
Harvard or Yale	ORGANIZATION	or
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	when in the twinkling of a bedpost one can become a Bachelor of Theologic
Symbolics	ORGANIZATION	, or a Master of Theomonism , or a Doctor of South American Indian Languages ?

		MARYLAND AUTHORS of more than local fame make a list that would reflect credit on any
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Henry E. Shepherd	PERSON	of
Baltimore	LOCATION	has found pleasant recreation for himself and has provided matter of interest to the reading public in a small book that he has just written , entitled `` Representa - tive Authors of
Maryland	LOCATION	, '' and published by the
Whitehall Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		A few of the more prominent names may here be noted from Dr.
Shepherd	PERSON	's pages .


Poe	PERSON	, for whom he has a loyal Southerner 's admiration , he is confi - dent has secured '' an abiding place such as no other American has ever attained or even approached . ''

		Lanier rightly receives a tribute of praise second only to that paid to
Poe	PERSON	.


James R. Randall	PERSON	, whom we commonly think of as a one-poem poet , is given rather disproportionate space in the book .

		`` My
Maryland	LOCATION	'' is the one production of his that the world is likely to remember .

		Other
Maryland	LOCATION	writers , some of them now almost forgotten , are
John P. Kennedy	PERSON	,
George Henry Miles	PERSON	,

STEVENSON	PERSON	AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS came into collision -LRB- without serious injury to either of the colliding bodies , although with some indirect discomfiture to
Stevenson	PERSON	-RRB- in the early years of
R. L. S.	PERSON	; and in view of the present world-wide interest in the declining prestige of the peers , it may be timely to recall the circumstances attending the youthful writer 's assault upon their hereditary rights .

		Mr.
Charles Baxter	PERSON	sends to the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Mail '' the following explanation of the ini - tials ''
L. J. R.	PERSON	'' that were used in the dedication to '' Treasure Island '' to indicate a certain society of a secret and mysterious nature . ''

		As I am the last survivor of that small band which was composed of R. L ; S. , his cousin
R. A. M. Stevenson	PERSON	, James 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Walter Ferrier	PERSON	who died young , affectionately commemorated by
Stevenson	PERSON	in prose and by
Henley	ORGANIZATION	in verse and two others , I absolve myself from the oaths of secrecy and decline to inflict upon my - self the necessary torture consequent upon my be - trayal .

		The initials signify Liberty ,
Justice	ORGANIZATION	,
Rever	PERSON	- ence .

		The ' constitution , ' drafted by me and whole - heartedly accepted by
Stevenson	PERSON	-LRB- we were still in our ` teens -RRB- , included among other important ob - jects , under the first head , ' the abolition of the hereditary privileges of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, ' a phrase which occasionally raised stumbling blocks in impassioned orations .

		I remember as if it were yesterday
Stevenson	PERSON	's agonized face as he came to me with the news that his father had come across the draft it never went farther .

		The discovery was the occasion of one of the most painful of the scenes between father and son . ''

		A GOOD PIECE OF ANTHEM-MENDING , executed by Dean Hole and sanctioned by
King George	PERSON	, gives to the English nation a welcome substitute for the rather jingoistic and by no means poetically admir - able stanza of their national hymn : '' O Lord our God , arise , Scatter his enemies , And make them fall ; Confound their politics , Frustrate their knavish tricks ; On Him our hopes we fix .

		Oh , save us all ! ''

		For these fire-breathing rhymes the eminent Dean offers the following more peaceful and , as a contri - bution to literature , far more excellent verses : '' O Lord our God , arise , Scatter his enemies , Make wars to cease .

		Keep us from plague and dearth , Turn Thou our woes to mirth , And over all the earth Let there be peace ! ''

		The royal sanction insures the adoption of the sub - stitute stanza ; and thus will be hastened , if never so little , the coming of that universal peace which at present is the object of so much of the world 's best thought and striving .

		THE SUPERLATIVE FUTILITY OF JEAN GlRAU - DOUX , who has for us something more of interest than many of his fellow-authors of
France	LOCATION	by reason of his having fitted himself in part at
Harvard	LOCATION	for the life of letters he seems to be now successfully leading , is amusingly dwelt upon and illustrated by Mr.
Alvan F. Sanborn	PERSON	in a
Paris	LOCATION	letter to the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript . ''

		His books seem thus far to have defied or escaped translation into En - glish , and therefore Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's samples in the vernacular are the more welcome .

		`` L'Ecole des Indifferents '' is the title of his latest work , and its style is likened by the critic to the tenuous fabric which , he has been told , someone has succeeded in weaving out of spiders ' webs .

		The book `` is osten - sibly divided into three narratives , but the nominal heroes of these three narratives -LRB- Jacques the Egoist ,
Don Manuel	PERSON	the Indolent ,
Bernard	PERSON	the Weak -RRB- are , in reality , but three manifestations of the same per - sonality '' the author himself .

		Some sentences and phrases are translated for our benefit .

		The pout of a little girl is '' the froth of her smile , '' and the smile of another character is `` a wearied , lone - some , scarcely fluttering smile nailed to the visage , like a wounded swallow to the door of a grange . ''


Don Manuel	PERSON	the Indolent avers that `` just as soon as we do not hate a woman , our happiness obliges us to confess to her the fact , and from that moment there is no longer a secret at the heart of our love to sustain it as the stone in the fruit sustains the fruit .

		Then everything that is furtive and uncertain , emotion in the presence of an attenuated gesture , hope and fervor , all the tumult of tenderness , vanish . ''

		Is it not a little early in the century for this exquisite perfection of decadence ?

		THE LITERATURE OF THE OCEAN LINER not the literature about , but the literature on -LRB- in a literal sense -RRB- the
Atlantic	LOCATION	greyhound must have struck many a reflective and observant deck-walker as leaving something to be desired in the way of substantiality and worth .

		To be sure , the ship 's library is commonly well-stocked with the classics of two or more nations , in fiction at least ; but the paper-covered supplements to this supply which the passengers themselves provide , and whose fluttering leaves on many a steamer-chair reveal their lightness of quality , indicate a frivolity in the reader 's mood that would strike dismay to the soul of any con - scientious librarian interested in the great question `` What do the people read ? ''

		and laboriously striv - ing to elevate the standard of that reading .

		Here , in sooth , is work cut out for our travelling-library officers , to persuade the travelling public to turn to better literary account the golden hours of leisure available to all who make the European tour .

		One could read up , in outline at least , the whole history of
Europe	LOCATION	on the way thither , or learn , for colloquial purposes , the more common phrases and idioms of the language spoken in the country or countries one is about to visit .

		With a preliminary reading of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's little manuals on the economy of time and of mental energy , wonders could be accom - plished in self - culture on an ocean voyage .

		AN AMERICAN GIRL AT THE COURT OF
NAPO	ORGANIZATION	- LEON III .

		tells in letters some of her more amusing or more memorable experiences , and the
August	DATE	''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' begins the publication of these letters .

		The writer , known at the time the letters were written as Mrs.
Charles Moulton	PERSON	, fam - ous for her singing and for her personal charm , is now the wife of the Danish minister to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The fun and laughter that she contrived to find even in the stiffness and formality of court functions make her letters unusually good reading .

		The inci - dent of the vain diplomat and his patent-leather shoes , and the dinner-table talk with The `` ophile

		THE DIAL 95 Gautier which brought out a French proverb with a double pun , and the eight-ball croquet game -LRB- '' nothing is so dreadful as a game of croquet with eight people , four of whom are beginners '' -RRB- with the Emperor and
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, the Prince and Princess Metternich , and other notabilities , furnish some pages of highly entertaining matter .

		But what we wish here to note with especial approval is the high - spirited young writer 's frank disapproval of that stupid as well as brutal performance , a chasse a tir .

		`` It was a dreadful sight !

		How I hate it !

		I am sure I shall not sleep for a week , for I shall always see the forms and faces of those quivering , dying creatures in my dreams .

		I never will go to a chasse again .

		And the worst was when they had frightened the birds and animals into a sort of circle , where they could not escape ; the butchery was awful .

		They said there were 3,800 pieces .

		Prince
Metter	PERSON	- nich alone shot 1,200 .

		How happy I was when it was all over and I could get away from these horrors and miserable sport ! ''

		A SINGULAR PROTEST FROM ALBEMARLE STREET sends its echoes to our shores .

		The historic
London	LOCATION	publishing house situated in that street strenuously objects to the clause of the proposed copyright bill which entitles the new
Welsh National Library	ORGANIZATION	to claim , if it chooses , a copy of every new book pub - lished .

		It is true this privilege is already enjoyed by five other libraries of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, and the free gift of six copies of very expensive works may reasonably be considered a not negligible drain on a publisher 's resources .

		But the gain in an advertising way , through the publicity thus secured for the publisher 's wares , can not fail in the long run to offset , and more than offset , the expense in - curred .

		The Albemarle Street protest has been taken up by a few other publishers , and letters to the press are the result .

		It may be that poor
Wales	LOCATION	is too little given to book-buying to make probable any handsome return from this compulsory gift to its
National Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even so , however , there are other obvious considerations that might make a public-spirited publisher think twice before begrudg - ing the proposed benefaction to Welsh readers .

		THE NEW ENGLAND OF Miss ALCOTT serves Mrs.
Katherine Fullerton Gerould	PERSON	as inspiring theme for a very readable article in the
August	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		She seems to have been prompted to write by the rather surprising confession of a school - girl friend that she , the friend , could never enjoy our
New England	LOCATION	favorite because her characters were so underbred .

		To Mrs.
Fullerton	PERSON	, on the other hand , '' Miss
Alcott	PERSON	seemed the safe inherit - ance , the absolutely inevitable delight , of childhood .

		1 Little Women ' was as universal as ' Hamlet . '

		I remember perfectly that French playmates of mine had loved ' Les Quatre Filles du Docteur March ' -LRB- though the French edition was probably somewhat expurgated -RRB- . ''

		Expurgating Miss
Alcott	PERSON	, however , would be like painting the lily or gilding refined gold .

		Adaptation or abbreviation she may have undergone at the hands of her French translator ; hardly expurgation .

		The unsympathetic reader mentioned must have been of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	birth or breeding .

		Many a lover of our
Concord	LOCATION	and Cam - bridge and
Boston	LOCATION	authors has had sorrowful occa - sion to note the lack of enthusiasm with which a Virginian or a Marylander or a Georgian may at times hear the names of the
New Englander	ORGANIZATION	's liter - ary idols , as may also the denizen of Fifth Avenue .

		It is the old story of the mutually antipathetic aris - tocracies of brains , birth , and wealth .

		THIS TEAR 'S LOUBAT PRIZE goes , by decree of the
Royal Prussian Academy of Science	ORGANIZATION	, to Profes - sor
Albert Bernhardt Faust	PERSON	, head of the German department at
Cornhill University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This prize , of three thousand marks , established in
1889	DATE	by Mr.
Joseph F. Loubat	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, is bestowed every five years upon the author of some meritorious work on American history or American archaeology , the two subjects alternating in their claims for recogni - tion .

		Ten years ago Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	was thus honored in consideration of the excellence of his '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	from the Com - promise of
1850	DATE	. ''

		This year it is Professor
Faust	PERSON	's scholarly work on `` The German Element in the
United States	LOCATION	'' that wins the prize .

		As a natural result of the award , the book is soon to be issued in a German edition by a leading
Leipzig	LOCATION	publisher .

		GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION OF A NOVELIST 'S MERITS has taken the substantial shape of a hundred - pound annual pension to Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		Poets and scientists and other writers of highly meritori - ous but not rapidly salable books have from time immemorial been the grateful recipients of royal or public bounty ; but for a producer of fiction , popular and commercially successful fiction , to be thus subsidized in the heyday of his literary activ - ity , is something unprecedented .

		Yet it is expressly '' in consideration of his merits as a writer of fiction '' that Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	is thus helped to make both ends meet , and , as one must surmise , consider - ably overlap .

		To him that hath shall be given .

		GERMAN DISLOYALTY TO THE CAUSE OF GREEK is to be noted , with surprise and sorrow on the part of many , in the recent decision to drop the language of Plato and
Demosthenes	PERSON	from the list of required gymnasium studies .

		English is substituted .

		How long now before
Latin	PERSON	will give way to , let us say , Italian or Russian , or some other commercially use - ful language ?

		Greek studies will continue to be pursued in
Germany	LOCATION	, and it is even possible that the making of such studies entirely voluntary will prove advantageous to genuine Greek scholarship .

		But no longer will the German university man be , almost as a matter of course , an accomplished classical student ; and the humanizing influence of Hellenic studies will necessarily suffer considerable restriction .

		96 THE DIAL Che SATJXTERINGS AMONG SUMMER ISLANDS .

		* However excellent the patriotic advice to '' see your own country first '' before journey - ing abroad , there is no reason why one should not enjoy
Europe	LOCATION	in books before making the acquaintance of every principal city and highest mountain and longest river in this land of mag - nificent distances and unrealized possibilities .

		And among the books that present scenes and characters pleasantly in contrast with the com - parative rawness , the lack of atmosphere , the hustling youthfulness , of our country , Mr.
J. E. Crawford Flitch	PERSON	's '' Mediterranean Moods '' deserves honorable mention .

		Wandering fancy - free among the islands of the
Balearic	ORGANIZATION	group and through
Sardinia	LOCATION	, he makes his foreign sojourn something more than a mere change of clime .

		For , as he says , '' the wise traveller comes not to conquer a country , but to be con - quered by it .

		His only tactic should be that of masterly inactivity .

		He arranges nothing .

		He takes no thought of the train he shall catch on the morrow . ''

		Letting the spirit of his temporary halting-place , the genius loci , as one likes to call it , exert its inspiring influence on him , the author has succeeded in making his pages breathe the atmosphere of those sleepy but romantic and picturesque old seaports doz - ing in the sunshine of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and lapped by its waters .

		The charm that lures him , however , has much of the fortuitous and evanescent in its character .

		Its capture in the first instance , and its recapture for book - writing purposes , are no simple matters .

		As he remarks in his preface , `` The circumstances which determine these perfect moments are themselves indeterminable .

		All that is certain is that they are wholly fortuitous .

		And some - times they are so minute that many overlook them .

		The high mood hangs upon a hint , an echo , a nothing .

		The rhythm of a woman 's walk in the midst of a crowd , and it is upon you a song heard in the
night	TIME	, music coming out of the open window of a lamp-lit room , a light burning over water , a boat running into harbour , the shape of an ancient vase , a glass of wine , a jewel in the ear ... '' It is the beautiful as it appeals to him , without regard to conventional principles of aesthetics or accepted canons of art , that delights and makes eloquent this frankly pleasure-seeking wanderer .

		After speaking admiringly of the surprisingly * MEDITERRANEAN MOODS .

		Footnotes of Travel in the Islands of
Mallorca	LOCATION	,
Menorca	LOCATION	,
Ibiza	LOCATION	, and
Sardinia	LOCATION	.

		By
J. E. Crawford Flitch	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	With illustrations and maps .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		beautiful Lonja -LRB- misprinted `` Longa '' under the illustration -RRB- or Exchange building of Palma de
Mallorca	LOCATION	, and of the finely-proportioned cathedral of the same hispanicized Moorish town , he makes the following frank confession of hedonistic faith : '' As a man grows older and a little more tired of the chatter about art , I think he brings to the gustation of any object of beauty a less intellectual and a more purely physical discernment .

		He no longer comes in order to purify his taste or to correct his judgment of this or the other school .

		He has lost the keenness of youth for great argument about art -LRB- perhaps because he has found out the true value of the lying Q. E. D.s -RRB- , and has become that thing that youth abhors the unashamed hedonist .

		He acquires the holiday-making , even the tripping , frame of mind ; he is frankly out for sensuous enjoyment .

		As he looks with his eyes , his spirit is put to sleep ; the mind forgets whatever learn - ing it has pillaged from aesthetic lumber-rooms ; the eye itself is passive , and appears to perceive without re - porting any articulate messages to the brain ; only the body is awake and alert .

		He uncovers his five naked senses , and only asks of art that she shall gratify them or as many of them as she can touch .

		And art responds so generously to this ingenuous appeal that she gives herself to him as she never gives herself to the cold analyst who uses her only for purposes of dissection . ''

		The right spirit , this , for a vacation saunterer , although on the very next page we find him hunting for a principle that shall explain the peculiar beauty and impressiveness of the inte - rior of
Palma	LOCATION	's cathedral .

		His interpretation of the matter is as follows : '' I have found the great beauty of the cathedral in that most difficult triumph of the architect 's art , the exquisite manipulation of space .

		The secret of its con - struction is that the architect has thrown a canopy of stone over the greatest possible area with the least pos - sible expenditure of material .

		Too often in a Gothic cathedral the tyranny of material robs the eye of its en - joyment ; there is a kind of exhibition of brute strength , which is imposing but fatiguing , as if a giant were straining to support a superhuman burden .

		But here the effort is concealed .

		The pillars leap upwards with a lightness , almost with a gaiety , which communicates that delight which we feel in a difficult thing easily accomplished .

		The difficult art which the architect of
Palma	LOCATION	's cathedral has mastered is to know how to carve out of the void a certain definite body of space which you can perceive and enjoy ; for it is only by circum - scribing space that you can appreciate it .

		In the rough quadrangle outside the cathedral , formed by a miscel - laneous grouping of buildings , although the sky is illimitably far above you , there is no sense of largeness ; but go inside , and although the roof , not two hundred feet above your head , shuts out the infinity of the sky , you are conscious of moving more freely in a more ample atmosphere . ''

		The people of these
Mediterranean	LOCATION	islands , no less than their buildings and other inanimate objects of interest , charm this generously appre - ciative visitor .

		Various dances of the islanders , of both sexes , are described in vivid terms which
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 make the reader see the rapidly moving forms and hear the castanets .

		After picturing a terpsichorean performance of the youths and maidens of
Ibiza	LOCATION	, on a smooth stretch of ocean beach , to the primitive music of a wooden pipe and a small drum , the writer thus concludes : '' There was not the beauty of grace , but the beauty of strength and agility in their movements .

		A shade more violence , and their dancing would have become a romp ; but the fierceness which always seemed to be warming to some dangerous explosion was kept from trespass by a careful restraint .

		I think that a man who has seen dancing at sunset by the sea and among moun - tains will never afterwards have much content in a ball - room .

		The pure air , the unimprisoned space , the trembling light upon the water , unlock a happier and profounder fund of emotions .

		Something elemental and infinitely remote enters into the exhilaration of the dancers ; they have recaptured a spirit which seems more proper to the sunlit early days of the world .

		Their personal life is merged in the universal life of Nature , and their bodies are renewed by the ancient energies of the earth and the sea .

		And yet the emotion which is thus set free does not lose itself in an animal riot , be - cause there is a traditional mould prepared for it to flow into , a controlling measure and impulse to which the limbs have moved for centuries . ''

		Even the beggars , in their picturesque rags , have a grace and dignity of their own in these
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lands .

		They can enter their fine old cathedrals and there comport themselves as if conscious of a part-ownership in the architect - ural grandeurs around and above them .

		The poor , in the midst of their frankly unconcealed squalor , seem to fit harmoniously into the scheme of things .

		The light-hearted penury of the humbler denizens of
Cagliari	LOCATION	, the picturesquely - situated capital of
Sardinia	LOCATION	, is quite another thing from the grinding poverty of our own slum quarters .

		If it be permissible to portray , with unshrinking realism , the unpoetic details of the daily life of the Italian poor , it could not be better done than by our author . ''

		Here , as in all Italian towns , the poor defeat the tedium vitce by an interested contemplation of each other 's privacy .

		Here the age of innocence is still un - corrupted by any modern notions of propriety .

		It is not felt that there are any details of person or toilette which it is necessary to conceal .

		The rooms of the ground - floor , whether bedrooms or sitting-rooms and com - monly they are both in one gape upon the street , and the street gapes back upon them .

		You are invited to scrutinise the bed that is never made and the meal that is never cleared away .

		All the business of the house - hold the cooking , washing , scrubbing , the paring of potatoes , the suckling of infants , the sewing of under - garments are conducted in public .

		The children crawl about the threshold with a strict economy of clothing .

		The men sleep upon the floor , and in their waking intervals approve or criticise the activities of the women .

		Family concerns of great delicacy are disputed with eloquence and anger .

		Every household appears to be in the throes of a domestic crisis ... Above all this scene of superabundant vitality flutters an array of brilliant and tattered linen , which gives the street the air of being perpetually en fete . ''

		This '' sudden surprising vision of the animal basis of life '' can not fail to impress the En - glish traveller , accustomed as he is at home to what he calls '' a silent conspiracy to deny the existence of one-half of the facts of life . ''

		A passage of interest to the language - student , and recalling the times of British dominion in
Menorca	LOCATION	, occurs in the description of
Puerto Mahon	LOCATION	.

		`` When you see the urchins of the port playing at knuckle-bones in the gutter and hear them call out ` knur-kle , ' it is not the English word that at first sounds strangely , but the unfamiliar accent .

		Many are the English words embedded in the Menorquin dialect .

		Because the English sailor called for his liquor in a bottle or a mug , the fisherman of
Mahon	PERSON	still orders his botil or moch of wine .

		Mitjamen , the name for the guardia marina , does not present a very English character in print , but it is merely ` midship - man ' disguised .

		And a curious reminder of the periods both of the English and the French occupation exists in the idiomatic expression for a handful of people , cuatrejans y un boy four Jeans and a boy . ''

		In singular opposition to Mr.
Flitch	PERSON	's theory that foreign travel should be something more than a changing of one 's latitude and longi - tude , that it should be , in short , a complete transformation of one 's inveterate habits of mind and body , is his cherished custom of carrying with him a certain quantity of
China	LOCATION	tea and a volume of English prose .

		His selec - tion of home-made reading matter on this occa - sion was a strange one
Gibbon	PERSON	's '' Decline and Fall '' in seven substantial volumes .

		He had once been told by '' a certain professor '' that a person who had not read
Gibbon	PERSON	was still fundament - ally uneducated ; hence the burdening of him - self with the voluminous history , which however we can still hope and believe he postponed read - ing until his return to his own fireside .

		Mr.
Flitch	PERSON	's well-written and well-printed book is also well illustrated , having a colored frontispiece from a drawing by Mr.
G. Biasi	PERSON	, and thirty-two reproductions of photographs , many if not all of them , we infer , from the author 's camera .

		Two good maps complete the work .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	. ''

		THE WORLD 'S WORK '' is the latest magazine to adopt the new system of magazine binding which does away with the awkward wire stitch and enables the magazine to be opened easily and laid down flat like a well-bound book .

		Another point in favor of the new way of binding is that it enables the reader to extract very easily any articles which he may wish to preserve , as there is no stitching or wire in the binding .

		98 THE DIAL THE SOPHISTS OF OUR DAY .

		* Mr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	has one claim upon the respect of American lovers of letters namely , that he has for a good while devoted much time and thought and energy to the office of a critic of the highest order .

		He has tried to make known in
America	LOCATION	what he deems the best that is being thought and written in the world .

		Being attracted by one or another of the '' world figures '' of the literature of our time , he has applied himself to a study of their works , has tried to settle for himself the char - acteristics of their contribution to our intellec - tual life and the value of that contribution .

		He has done this with high standards and with hard work .

		He has not picked up one or another author who rose above the surface of cosmopolitan observation and gathered together a little of the gossip as to their life or ideas , for the amusement of those whose aim it is to know what has been going on in the world of letters ; he has noted the figures in contemporary literature that seemed most worthy of notice , has got together everything that could be found about them , and has studied each matter care - fully in the light of the best ideas of the world at large .

		He has viewed the critical literature of
Europe	LOCATION	to find out what was thought by the best judges on the subject , and then he has made up his own presentation .

		That seems to me an excellent thing to do , merely in itself .

		I believe there is more or less lacking in Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's equipment as a critic : indeed , he seems to me more of a student than a critic , more successful in unravelling the series of facts in the past and present than in putting his finger on just what is essential or in expressing unmistak - ably just what people ought to know .

		But in so far as he tries to take the place of a true critic , and to prepare himself for such a place by severe and earnest study , he has certainly done well .

		The results of his study have already come before the public in a more or less ephemeral way in various papers and reviews in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, as well as in this country ; but now a collection of studies gives us a chance to consider his work in a large way and to give an estimate of its value .

		The volume , which he entitles '' Interpreters of Life and the Modern Spirit , '' contains studies on
George Meredith	PERSON	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		I do not understand that these essays are reprints of articles already INTERPRETERS OF LIFE AND THE MODERN SPIRIT .

		By
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		published ; indeed , they seem obviously not .

		They appear to be essays on authors who are par - ticularly selected as standing together , or having something to do with each other , and whom he conveniently groups as '' Interpreters of Life . ''

		I shall put on one side the great temptation to combat at length the idea implied in that title , and shall content myself with thinking that these authors are not distinctively inter - preters of life , and that they know no more of life than anybody else .

		I suspect that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	really thinks so too ; for he seems to me to leave this matter of interpretation chiefly on the cover of his book , while in the inside he deals with the much more appropriate topic of literature .

		The first object of attention , I confess , seems to be against me . ''

		Narrative is nothing , '' says
Meredith	PERSON	, in a quotation on page 11 . ''

		It is the mere vehicle of philosophy .

		The interest is in the idea which the action seems to illus - trate . ''

		That looks as though
Meredith	PERSON	con - ceived of himself as an interpreter of life ; and Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	deepens the idea by devoting a section of his essay to ''
Meredith	PERSON	's conception of the nature of humanity . ''

		Still , it is only an appeal to fact -LRB- as existent in the mind of any reader -RRB- to say that
Meredith	PERSON	is not interesting because of any particular view of life .

		He doubtless had a view of life , as most of us have ; and of course he expressed it in his novels , as we express our views in our own words and acts .

		But he is not especially interesting be - cause of the '' idea which the action seems to illustrate . ''

		He is interesting because he pre - sents very vital men and women doing things in a very vital way .

		And his ideas are interesting not because they are illustrated by the actions , as he seems to think himself , but because the ideas -LRB- where there are any -RRB- are implicit in the action , which is the way we are very apt to get them in life .

		In other words ,
Meredith	PERSON	's novels are interesting because they are good novels : as Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	points out , they have a peculiar kind of action , and they are expressed in a pecu - liar kind of language .

		But this action and this language , when one gets used to it , prove a stimulus rather than a drawback , so that we have a feeling of pleasure and exhilaration on reading Meredith that we should not otherwise have .

		He was a great artist ; and that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	appreciates .

		But I am sure few remember him as a philosopher .

		Far more is this the case with
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	.

		Indeed , in the essay on Wilde there is very little question of interpretation of life .

		Mr.
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 99
Henderson	PERSON	kindly reminds us that
Wilde	PERSON	said himself , '' I treated art as the supreme reality , and life as a mere mode of fiction . ''

		I would , indeed , go a little farther than Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	in this direction .

		What a singular element in life was the first reading of `` Intentions '' some twenty years ago !

		Interpretation it certainly was not ; but certainly too it made things seem for the time different from what they had been .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	gives a very interesting account of Oscar Wilde 's career , paying rather the most attention to his work in the drama .

		It may seem capricious to disagree with Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	for emphasizing the philosophy in the case of
Meredith	LOCATION	, and also for not emphasiz - ing it in the case of Oscar Wilde .

		I will not do either with the next essay .

		Maeterlinck is openly a philosopher as well as an artist .

		But Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	deals chiefly with
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's drama , and gives a very interesting review of his plays , from the extraordinary '' Princess Maleine '' down to '' The Blue Bird `` a good review , and at the end touched with personal impressions and experience .

		The essay on
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, also , the most important , or at least the longest , in the book , is chiefly a dramatic record .

		This is a very careful study , with the fundamental notion supplied by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	himself , of the idea of thoroughly consecutive develop - ment .

		Such a study will be peculiarly interest - ing to many people .

		Ibsen is perhaps not so interesting to-day as he was once , or as he will be .

		Still , many will be glad to make more definite the somewhat confused series of impres - sions that surround his name in their minds .

		Indeed , this is the case with every essay in the volume .

		I know of no other book that has so much actual information on the men he writes of .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is sometimes a little too scintillating for me .

		He has , I should say , rather too much allusion .

		But he certainly has much very interesting detail and fact .

		These superficial remarks , however , do not make up what seems to me the main point of importance in the work .

		My chief impression is that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is so influenced by the idea that
Ibsen	PERSON	and the others are interpreters of life , that he fails to treat them as dramatists or novelists .

		I am sure that he can not really think they are most important as interpreters of life , but having always that idea in mind , he never gets very definitely to the actual liter - ary problem .

		We have heard so much of `` art for art 's sake , '' of '' mere technique , '' and so on , that it seems trivial to ask for a view of a novel as a novel , of a play as a play .

		But it is quite time that people should think of that matter once more .

		To mention one or two cases that will serve as general instances : The comedies of Oscar Wilde form an important part of his work .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's interest is largely in the drama , and we should naturally expect him to give an estimate of them .

		The main features of those plays are without doubt their dialogue and their satire ; such is my recollection , and such seems Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's idea -LRB- see pp. 84 , 86 , 88 , 93 , 94 , 96 -RRB- .

		But these things are not necessarily dramatic : they might be present in other forms of writings ; indeed , they are more noteworthy in '' Intentions '' than in the comedies .

		In fact , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	says that
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's comedies are resplendent by reason of qualities that have no intrinsic or organic relation to dramatic art , and he takes pains to point out that as far as dramatic technique is concerned
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is an imitator of Scribe , and therefore is far behind the times .

		In such a case , I should suppose the critic would either analyze the character of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's dialogue and satire , and show what was in it , or analyze the dramatic technique and show what was not in it or else -LRB- preferably -RRB- do both .

		An adequate study of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's paradox and satire would go far toward showing what his real hold is on people who disapprove of him .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	quotes -LRB- p. 92 -RRB- a very interesting remark of Professor
Hermann Bahr	PERSON	on the subject .

		That sort of thing would really do something toward giving us an idea of Wilde 's '' interpretation of life . ''

		A study of the dramatic technique , on the other hand , would make us see what was the real weakness of those very attractive pieces of work , and how with all their brilliancy they fail to make the impression upon us that is made by dramas that are really great .

		But Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son 's criticism on the subject consists mostly of allusions : he knows about these things , but he .

		does not say what he knows .

		The result is that there is still place for an essay on Oscar Wilde that will give the essential thing about his come - dies , and , indeed , about his art as a whole .

		I should like to see a book about Oscar Wilde , or
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, or
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, or any other dra - matist , that would not talk around the subject of their dramatic art , but would tell us what it really is .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	says of Ibsen -LRB- p. 167 -RRB- : `` There can be little doubt that in certain plays the technique displayed is inex - tricably bound up with the literary genius that devised it . ''

		I believe that something of that sort is true about any great writer .

		He is gen - 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, erally immensely interested in his technique ; and if we insist on being interested in his inter - pretations of life , we run the risk of not seeing matters as he sees them .

		As to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, I gather from Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	that he has revolutionized the dramatic technique of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		I also gather that his method is fundamentally this : to choose certain typical figures and let the dra - matic situations arise from them ; to leave out characters that are not significant or necessary to the action ; to complicate the motives that are implicit in the action , but to simplify the action itself , as by cutting out minor plots ; to make the dialogue more natural by using conversa - tional language , and by leaving soliloquies and asides , and also to make it richer by its sig - nificance of implication .

		Further , his idea is generally to give the present as a development of the past .

		Such -LRB- correct or not -RRB- affords a general statement of technique that one can explain and illustrate , or consider and compare ; but it is gathered from half a dozen places in Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book , and perhaps after all does not rightly represent him .

		These things are significant of the main defect of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's presentations .

		He fails to give us a really definite conception of his subject .

		He is serious and enthusiastic and appreciative , so that one feels assured that what one is reading is worth while .

		He avoids the very common faults of being gossipy , or pretentious , or gushing .

		He is very instruc - tive as he goes along , both biographically and bibliographically ; one may learn much from these essays .

		He is very brilliant , too , in fact , far too brilliant for me , who am too prone perhaps to detect empty smartness in anything that is not humdrum matter of fact .

		But some - how I do not get from him very much that is really definite , either on the subject on which he seems to think he is writing , or on the subject on which I presume he really is writing .

		A BINOCULAR VIEW OF
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		* Not often does the public enjoy a better op - portunity for a binocular view of
Japan	LOCATION	than is afforded in the recent appearance of two very diverse studies the one by an English - woman long resident in the Empire , and the * BEHIND THE SCREENS IN

		other by an English artist who spent a year there painting Japanese gardens .

		Miss
Adam	PERSON	's '' Behind the Screens in
Japan	LOCATION	'' is a volume of disillusionment ; Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	's ''
Japan	LOCATION	and the Japanese '' restores to the Sunrise Kingdom its orient charm and leaves one ready to take up again his
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	.

		Which is the true picture of the real
Japan	LOCATION	?

		Perhaps , as Dr.
Arthur Smith	PERSON	remarks of
China	LOCATION	, everything that has ever been said of
Japan	LOCATION	is true .

		At least , one feels sure that many contradictory experiences of these two writers are soluble in the very complex solvent called human nature , and in that particular yellow vessel of the same solvent that we name the Japanese nation .

		Miss
Adam	PERSON	writes in a style that gains confidence at the start .

		She views her subject from the vantage-ground of long and intimate personal acquaintance .

		Through extended resi - dence and travel among the Japanese , she has accumulated in memory a stock of facts , inci - dents , conversations , faces , personalities , that come readily to her pen and give to her pages the charm of good talk by one who knows whereof she speaks .

		From this well-stored memory she has drawn material for definite general views of Japanese character , and these views are very persuasively set forth in the form of incident , portraiture , narrative .

		Seen through her eyes , the lustrous lacquer of out - ward appearance peels off the present genera - tion of much-lauded subjects of the
Mikado	LOCATION	, leaving bare the stuff of which they are com - posed .

		Miss
Adam	PERSON	's eyes have the faculty of making this inside stuff seem poor and cheap .

		Their loved Tokio is ugly and dirty ; their train de luxe from
Kobe	PERSON	to the capital is slow and stuffy ; the passengers are often vulgar and mean .

		What did one of these gentlemen do when a demure little woman had stood balancing herself a long while in a corner of the jolting car and no one had shifted his portmanteau to give her a seat ?

		He kindly spread a sheet of newspaper on the floor and motioned her to sit on that `` which she did gratefully . ''

		And how did another gentleman , on a freezing night , provide himself with fresh air and yet avoid the danger of a cold ? ''

		He waited till his neighbor on the opposite side of the car was fast asleep and snoring , then quietly leaned across his sleeping vis a vis and opened his window .

		Next morning one traveller woke re - freshed , the other found himself buried under a light snow-drift . ''

		When one reads , farther , of a portly gentleman who disrobed completely in the car in the presence of a number of
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 101 foreign ladies and stalked a troublesome flea , one feels that the gold lacquer is gone from a gingerbread article called Japanese courtesy .

		Miss
Adam	PERSON	is not always so severe as she appears in these incidents .

		She has a friendly sense of humor , just a little superior , however , to its object .

		Few things that she views in
Japan	LOCATION	does she take with perfect seriousness .

		The beholder always smiles or nearly always .

		Some of her comic pictures are charming ; as when she describes the Japanese gentleman sauntering down to the hot
spring	DATE	, sitting on the edge of the big sunken tank , cooling one corner of the water with a plank , and then sliding in .

		He chats with `` acquaintances who have begun to boil before him . ''

		There may be trouble when he bows farewell . ''

		The out - sider can , of course , put in his usual graceful flourishes , but the insider is at a disadvantage ; he is almost sure to look like a porpoise about to dive , and if he is not very careful his polite inquiries after the health of his friend may appear only as air bubbles on the surface of the water . ''

		The titles of many of the chapters show the author 's attitude to be one of mild half - amused , half-grieved indignation ; for instance , '' A Little Knowledge Is a Dangerous Thing , '' '' A Nation of Mimics , '' '' Bribery and Corruption , '' '' The Awkward Age . ''

		One questions if in the last two chapters in the book '' Some Old - fashioned Virtues '' and `` Some Reflections '' there is not contained , besides a resume of the subject , also a hint of the source of Miss
Adam	PERSON	's rather satirical attitude toward the Japanese .

		In treating the old-fashioned virtues , she con - trasts them with the new-fashioned vices .

		Has Miss
Adam	PERSON	lived too long in the awkward age of transition between the old-fashioned virtues and the new , and may we not hope that this period will be redeemed richly when the new virtues arrive ?

		If the people have two souls the nigi-mi-tama , or gentle spirit , and the ara-mi-tama , or rough spirit may we not expect a victory of the former over the latter ?

		Surely the old-fashioned virtues can not die and leave no inheritors .

		At any rate , it was only the gentle spirit , the nigi-mi-tama , that revealed itself to our second writer , Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	.

		He is a clear-eyed ob - server , and seems not to have been content to view only the objects before the shoji that Miss Adam pried behind ; and yet he passed the year in
Japan	LOCATION	with serene spirits and unruffled tem - per .

		Whether because he is an artist and could see only the quaint artistry of Japanese dress , customs , and life , or whether because all
Japan	LOCATION	loves a lover of gardens , the Empire delighted Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	by the charm and gentleness and other virtues of its people .

		The volume is a narrative of the personal experiences of a landscape painter in a residence of a year and travels extending over a large portion of the main island of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Beginning with a glimpse of
Moji	ORGANIZATION	in the extreme south , the painter takes us through
Kobe , Kioto	PERSON	, and on through the places of chief charm , up to
Nikko	ORGANIZATION	and down again to
Atami	LOCATION	.

		He narrates his experiences , portrays many types of men and women he met or observed , comments on the character of the people , combats hostile foreign prejudices , describes the scenes he painted , and -LRB- best of all -RRB- gives us thirty-two colored repro - ductions of his own water-colors .

		Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	's style is simple and unpreten - tious ; he even slips several times in his gram - mar. .

		But the impression of his personality conveyed by the account of his year in
Japan	LOCATION	is altogether pleasing , and the Japanese appear in his pages very human and possessed of their due share of virtues .

		He exposes certain of the unjust criticisms of the Japanese by foreigners , and gives us a vivid description of the rudeness of certain types of foreigners to Japanese .

		A landlady at charming
Atami	PERSON	had spent hours in decorating her dining-room for the Christmas dinner to be enjoyed by foreigners from Tokio .

		She had taken special pride in the arrangement of her flower centrepiece .

		When a handsome young Englishman had twice brushed his fore - head against a spray of the plant , he called out to the landlady , '' Here , old lady !

		take this damn thing away ! ''

		So if , as Miss Adam feels , many Japanese are insufferably conceited , many Englishmen are insupportably rude .

		Thirty-two colored illustrations lend a very unusual charm to this book .

		They differ widely in excellence , but a number of them are exqui - site pictures .

		The Bozen-kaku garden , the Kiomidzu temple at Kioto with the blossoming Judas-tree before it , do something more than convey one to
Japan	LOCATION	: they bring one back endowed with an artist 's eyes .

		102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, Ax EXPOSITOR OF UNITABIANISM .

		* Recognizing , as they do , the right to differ , members of the Independent or
Congregational Churches	ORGANIZATION	would not assume to speak with au - thority of .

		the views of these bodies , yet they can not refrain from testifying of the light that has been vouchsafed them .

		It might be expected that Mr.
Emerton	PERSON	, as professor of
Church History	ORGANIZATION	, would indulge in much more history of doctrines than may be found in his recent attempt to state the Unitarian position .

		In fact , he indulges in very little technical theology , but states in a clear and scholarly manner his view of the distinctive position of Unitarianism : the unitary nature of the uni - verse governed by unchanging law , the dignity and indefinite perfectibility of human nature , the value of the
Bible	LOCATION	as the unique but wholly fallible religious literature of Judaism and early Christianity , the equally unique and fal - lible moral leadership of the man Jesus , the repudiation of sacrificial mediatorship and the substitution for it of a conception of progres - sive redemption by character , the church as the family of the religious-minded , the trust in the future life , the fatherhood of God .

		Professor
Emerton	PERSON	is writing in part for those persons who have `` an unfavorable im - pression of Unitarians as wicked and danger - ous persons not safely to be intrusted with important public or private duties , '' and there - fore rightly points out how the Unitarian stand - point is often the older , the primitive one ; or again , how it has developed from older views , still maintaining points of contact .

		While he does not so insistently emphasize the fact that the views he presents are practically those of the leaders of all the great Christian churches save the Roman Catholic , any so-called ortho - dox reader of his book may well ask himself , If this is Unitarian belief , why do the Unitarians constitute a separate body ?

		It is because they are not willing to be part of the `` large and respectable fraction of the membership in all the ' orthodox ' sects that is retained only by sacrifices of sincerity which can not be made forever with impunity . ''

		In setting forth the point of view of the older church , the author is sometimes so sympathetic and so earnest that a reader quite unacquainted with the differences will be misled into thinking that he is reading the author 's views rather than those which he is criticizing .

		But such a misunderstanding * UNITARIAN THOUGHT .

		By
Ephraim Emerton	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		will be but for a moment .

		The style is the usual clear and reasoning discourse of the author of '' The Introduction to the Middle Ages '' of the scholar who is perfectly sure of his ground and convinced of the soundness of his position , free from the bitterness of sectarian strife , conscious of essential harmony with the best thought of his time .

		Quite in accord with the emphasis and im - portance given to this branch of Unitarian thought , Mr.
Emerton	PERSON	's longest and best chap - ter is that on the Nature of Man .

		The Uni - tarian thought of God was at heart the thought of nearly all great thinkers in all sects before modern Unitarianism arose .

		But the dignity and worth of human nature , the protest against the doctrine of the fallen and depraved nature of man , it was this which most distinguished the protests of Priestly ,
Channing	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Parker	PERSON	.

		It is this standpoint to which all modern Christian churches have come , although thus brought into often unconscious conflict with the traditional creeds and watchwords which stand upon their banners and their shields .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Emerton	PERSON	is less ex - plicit than his inquiring readers may expect on the subject of the nature of God .

		A '' great city daily '' recently informed its readers that Unitarians do not believe in a personal God .

		They could not find the denial of the affir - mation of this unwarranted statement in the present volume .

		Unitarians have learned how greatly the word '' personality '' is misunder - stood , and regarding the nature of God they are cautious about dogmatizing .

		Most of them are willing to sum up their beliefs in the beautiful poem of Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	, a stanza of which intro - duces Mr.
Emerton	PERSON	's chapter : '' One thought I have , my ample creed , So deep it is and broad , And equal to my every need , It is the thought of God . ''


W. H. CARRUTH	PERSON	.

		PRINCESS LOUISA OF
TUSCANY	LOCATION	, who deliberately compromised herself in the eyes of the
Saxon Court	ORGANIZATION	that she might escape the tyranny that it exercised over the expression of her individuality , has added to her offence against the standards of propriety at
Dresden	LOCATION	by an - nouncing that she has written the story of the events which led to her sensational escape .

		It is rumored that the announcement was met by a threat from the court to stop the ex-crown princess ' annual allowance of
$ 15,000	MONEY	, but that the lady was not deterred .

		Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, who will publish the book in the Fall , say it is not only dramatic but true to the facts on both sides of the long fight which Princess Louisa waged .

		THE DIAL 103 RECEXT POETRY .

		* '' The Collected Poems of
Maurice Baring	PERSON	'' are the exhibitions , decorous and restrained , of a sensi - tive soul , responsive to many aspects of beauty .

		They give unfailing pleasure , yet they do not greatly stir the emotional deeps .

		This is one of Mr.
Baring	PERSON	's sonnets . ''

		She listened to the music of the spheres ; We thought she did not hear our happy strings ; Stars diademmed her hair in misty rings , And all too late we knew those stars were tears .

		Without she was a temple of pure snow , Within were piteous flames of sacrifice ; And underneath the dazzling mask of ice A heart of swiftest fire was dying slow .

		She in herself , as lonely lilies fold Stiff silver petals over secret gold , Shielded her passion , and remained afar From pity .

		Cast red roses on the pyre !

		She that was snow shall rise to Heaven as fire In the still glory of the morning star . ''

		The greater part of Mr.
Baring	PERSON	's collection is given up to longer pieces , mostly dramatic in form .

		There is a fine '' Tristram and Iseult '' in five acts , a masque of '' Proserpine , '' two dramatic scenes with the Black Prince for their hero , and a poem dealing with the legend of ''
Sigurd	PERSON	. ''

		From the last named of these we extract the verses , in which the Volsung , on the eve of death in battle , chooses the eternal future that he would fain have for his own . ''

		I that have battled though my soul despaired , And loved with love more great , more sad than death , I that have borne irreparable wrong , Which ages of bright bliss can not repair ; I , knowing that the hour of Fate has come , Would fain at last possess the whole of peace .

		Let me be drenched in Death 's divinest dew , Let me be cradled in immensity , Let me inherit all oblivion And the impregnable night of the dumb grave , The night unvisited by any star , The sleep un vexed by any wandering dream .

		Then shall I be rewarded with the void , The inviolable darkness and the dust , The secrecy , the silence , and the sleep Unbroken by the struggling pangs of morn . ''

		How many a wearied spirit has felt that sleep , after all , is best , and longed , with this poet , for rest in the garden of Proserpine !

		`` The Little City '' of Mr.
Wilfred Rowland Childe	PERSON	's fancy is thus described : '' Between the moon and sun , Far , far beyond the stars , Where comes not any one , Nor roll the great world 's cars , With an angel all day through , That wears a golden crown , And is robed in red and blue , I find the Little Town . ''

		It is a pleasant place , but only dreamers find access to it .

		Mr.
Childe	PERSON	's little book of poetical flutter - ings has many charms , not the least of which is the artful nawett of its expression .

		The author is at his best in the rapt and quiet mood of such a poem as `` Vespers . '' ''

		The light is going away from the dear world : It is all vanished with the sunken sun ; Into long lines of rest the clouds are curled , And slumber all but one . ''

		That , hung up-piled , shines over all its height With loveliest gold and rose of softened fire , Borrowing from the west unearthlier light , As it mounts slowly higher . ''

		Quickly like a dream the evening Droops with its dim veils on the silent wood ; A few brown birds make deeper as they sing The heavenly solitude . ''

		Ah , blessed dream !

		surely I seem to see How in Her place of light where no wind blows , Shines in Her glorious virginity The White and Mystic Rose . ''

		Alas !

		the darkness falls upon my vision , And on the woods it falls , and on the lands ; Yet , though the cities hold it in derision ,
The City	LOCATION	of Heaven stands . ''

		The gleam of mysticism softly shines upon many of these poems , and their wistful quality makes them very appealing .

		In Mr.
D. A. Slater	PERSON	's '' JEneas , '' the Virgilian hero thus defends himself against the charge of perfidy to Dido : '' Mother o ' mine , thou knowest , No traitor I , ... save that I was a man .

		But when , ah God , I had given all else to stay Lapped round with love , my glory forfeited , Or plunged beneath the foam and passed with her To some dim bower of rest beyond the strife , Thy stern , imperious mandate drove me on Unloved , unresting : still the waste of seas , The din of battle , hazardous emprise , Unsatisfying conflict , till our gods Were stablished in the
Westland	LOCATION	, and our Troy Within the
Westland	ORGANIZATION	found her promised home ,
Whence Justice	ORGANIZATION	should go forth to rule the world .

		... Not happines but duty , thine and mine , Not happiness but patience was the star To steer by ; so we laid the course , for so From those ten years of travail within Troy Should spring the centuries of world-wide strength , Steadfast unshaken strength , the dower of
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, Mr.
Slater	PERSON	's little sheaf of verses is made up of classical gleanings , and shows us once more how sure are the foundations of good taste and poetical feeling that are built upon the rock of Greek and Roman literature .

		Working with such a basis , it becomes almost impossible for a poet to achieve banality or dulness .

		The `` Poems and Ballads '' of Mr.
Henry DeVere Stacpoole	PERSON	are songs of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Greece	LOCATION	, of the seasons , of dreamland , and of childhood .

		Some are spirited , as '' Cavaliers , O Cavaliers ! '' ''

		Ye had faults , but , God , how fine Were ye in those troublous years !

		Loved ye women , dice , and wine , But in battle how divine Stood ye forth , Cavaliers ! ''

		We have men and we have swords , And a name the whole world fears , Yet by futile men of words Driven are we like the herds , Twisted like the vane that veers . ''

		Wake in us , O Spirits grand , For our turning-point now nears , By the strength of
England	LOCATION	's hand She shall fall or she shall stand Queenly in the unborn years . ' ''

		One for King and Country , all , Heedless though the whole world hears , Sound the bugle , at the call Help us so we hold the wall !

		Cavaliers , O Cavaliers ! ''

		Some are prettily fanciful , as '' Toy Town '' : '' All April-green ` neath
April	DATE	skies Beyond the land of Spring it lies ; Beyond the hills and far away , A vanished country quaint and gay . ''

		Sometimes in
Spring	DATE	, when south winds blow , And o'er the blue the white clouds go , Nodding in dreams I hear from there Faint sounds as of a distant fair ; The tap of drums , toy trumpets blown , The hubbub of a fairy town , '' A town the strange metropolis Of folk whose curious faith was this : A firm belief in
Noah	LOCATION	's Ark By day , and goblins after dark . ''

		And some are finely imaginative , as the `` Hymn to Selene . '' ''

		She hath watered her steeds at the mystic wells Where the spirit of sleep in the lotus dwells , Pallid and fair o'er the twilit tides O'er the asphodels And the night she glides '' Above her lieth the steep dark , free Swept by the winds of infinity ; The spume of her steeds as a pale fire spills O'er the slumbrous sea , O'er the silent hills . ''

		Night behind on the dark sea 's brink Watcheth her coursers pale and sink , Before her day like a dappled fawn Steals to drink At the pools of dawn . ''

		Hail !

		maiden who casteth thy light O'er the dark fields and the valleys of night , O'er the wan cities , the woodlands fair ; Earthly delight And the world 's despair . '' ''

		Suffering has long been acknowledged as an indispensable factor in the building up of souls ; the place of love and happiness is less secure .

		It is at least possible that there are stunted souls who can not converse fully with the Divine Father till they have had ampler draughts from the breasts of natural joy .

		Aquinas speaks of two kinds of joy : joy in God and joy in His works .

		The writer has not ventured to do more than trouble the curtain that hides the power , and the joys of the Porch of
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	are chiefly of the latter , or joys such as we haltingly pursue upon this present earth . ''

		Thus Miss
Anna Bunston	PERSON	discourses , in explanation of her narrative poem in blank verse which she calls `` The Porch of Paradise . ''

		It is a poem of mys - ticism , describing a pilgrimage through some imag - inary world a shadowy world , yet deeply affected by the emotions of humankind under the guid - ance of St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	.

		A passage taken al - most anywhere will illustrate its quality , for the poem is of remarkably even excellence .

		These are almost the closing lines of the work : '' We ceased , for
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's tender melodies , The sum of every welcoming since life Began , God 's heart made audible , swelled out Upon our ears .

		Beside us all the dusk Was troubled as with flight of homing birds , And lo !

		our best and loveliest , the sons Of God too kingly to be hid , were sped Toward the haven of their hearts ' desire And ours .

		They were our vanguard , they the hands To grasp the shore which soon the feet should tread , The outer petals of the living rose Red with the wine of Christ ; that rose of which The flower of
Sharon	ORGANIZATION	was the archetype .

		And we , who shared one sap , one dew , with them , And with the folded leaflet , of the church On earth were not cast down because some leaves Leant over-ripe and revolute , but stood , Our thankful
Nunc Dimittis	PERSON	said , to hear The firmamental praise , the singing stars , The voice of many waters and the sound Of harps , the song of first fruits unto God , The clash of cymbals and the cry of strings , The six-winged seers Trisagion , the hymns Of all the elders with the rhythmic beat Of angels ' wings like forest leaves in
June	DATE	. ''

		Miss
Nina Salaman	PERSON	's `` The Voices of the Rivers '' is a volume of little lyrics , now grave and now tender , of which this `` Song of a Night '' may be given as an example : '' Thank God for stars , thank God for night at last , Such night with stars to give the darkness eyes .

		O could the soul find voice in any wise While every night was blind before the blast ? ''

		When every night was mad with tempest cries , When heaven 's face was utterly withdrawn , And night seemed dark beyond all power of dawn , Could soul cast song against the deafened skies ? ''

		Thank God for stars again , and watch the morn : What shall the day be , born of such a night ?

		Flushing of skies and glow of gradual light ; Heart , save thy singing till the day is born . ''

		A deeply religious note is sounded in most of these simple and sincere songs .

Joel Elias Spingarn	PERSON	bids us live once more in the dream which inspired the early seekers after a new world , and shaped itself in fact with the expedition of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		The myth of Atlantis and the legendary voyages of
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	and
St. Brandan	LOCATION	are woven with the narratives of a more authentic history into a tapestry of quest and achievement that is fair to look upon .

		And all these elements are merged into a prophetic vision of that new world of the spirit which the future may disclose in this western hemisphere . ''

		O country that
Columbus	LOCATION	sought in vain , And seeking thee De Leon found no peace , For us they left the dream to reap , and gain A fairer Golden Fleece ; For us they left the unascended heights , And in our lives to light the eternal fires , Like pinnacled stars of unimagined nights ; For us they left these more than
Fortunate Isles	LOCATION	, Found in the highest heaven of our desires , And guarded round with nature 's sweetest smiles ; Oh , dearest land , that deep in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's heart , In
Franklin	PERSON	's brain , and in the righteous sword Of
Washington	LOCATION	, hast reared thine eagle 's nest , And in their fame they greater glory stored , Kindling the light that never can depart , In that high citadel within the mind , Whose masonry outlasts the baser hand , They built a realm we daily hope to find . ''

		Oh , who can tell the harvest we shall reap , Who sow as seeds the truths that never sleep , Daring the future ?

		Not for us to solve The unreasoning reason of superfluous woe , Death , and the mystery of our sins and hates , That hold the heart of starry faith aglow ; But Time to conquer , and unequal fates To equalize in their supreme resolve , Thro ' the slow changes of unchanging time : All the great nations shaped themselves for this , All the great battles fought for this one cry , All the great heroes died for this one bliss ; O lovely Eden , panting in the sway That freedom gives , grow mightier with its powers , And prove thy heroes did not die in vain , In the mere turmoil of insurgent hours ; For now at last the world is man 's to gain , And all our hopes foresee that happier day When man with God shall in one godhead reign . ''

		Besides this titular poem , Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's volume gives us a group of exquisite minor pieces , and a lovely '' Prothalamion '' from which we may make one brief quotation : '' Not here within the bridal clasp of hands , But in the Eden of your highest hope , The perfect future stands ; You do foretoken that diviner day We eat our hearts in praying for , and grope Thro ' shadows on the never-ending way ; The goal is far , but earth and heaven the prize ; And yield to every hope your nuptials rouse ; For .

		echoing
Sinai	ORGANIZATION	,
Nazareth	LOCATION	is wise , And all the heartache of the grinding years Is buried in your deathless marriage vows . ''

		Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	is a welcome accession to the choir of our younger singers ; he has the sense of beauty , conjoined with the gift of refined and subtle ex - pression .

		His phrases and cadences are carefully considered , for he is not a fluent poet , but he rarely fails to strike a high note with pure intonation .

		A striking illustration of the poetry that may be found in prosaic subjects is afforded by Mr.
George Sterling	PERSON	's verses on '' The Apothecary 's , '' with the `` red and emerald beacons '' that attract the passer-by . ''

		Venoms of vision , myrrh of splendid swoons , They wait us past the green and scarlet moons .

		Here prisoned rest the tender hands of Peace , And there an angel at whose bidding cease The clamors of the tortured sense , the strife Of nerves confounded in the war of life .

		Within this vial pallid Sleep is caught , In that , the sleep eternal .

		Here are sought Such webs as in their agonizing mesh Draw back from doom the half-reluctant flesh .

		There beck the traitor joys to him who buys , And Death sits panoplied in gorgeous guise . ''

		Mr.
Sterling	PERSON	's sonnets are singularly fine , and may be illustrated by '' The Huntress of Stars . '' ''

		Tell me , O Night !

		What horses hale the moon !

		Those of the sun now rear on
Syria	LOCATION	's day , But here the steeds of
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	delay At heavenly rivers hidden from the noon , Or quench their starry thirst at cisterns hewn In
midnight	TIME	's deepest sapphire , ere she slay The Bull , and hide the Pleiades ' dismay , Or drown
Orion	ORGANIZATION	in a silver swoon .

		Are those the stars , and not their furious eyes , That now before her coming chariot glare ?

		Is that their nebulous , phantasmal breath Trailed like a mist upon the winter skies , Or vapors from a
Titan	ORGANIZATION	's pyre of death Far - wafted on the orbit of Altair ? '' ''

		What names the stars have ! ''


William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	once said to us , upon a chance mention of
Antares	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Sterling	PERSON	has a clear sense of the poetical value of star-names , as many of his pieces show .

		He has been daring enough to write an additional chapter for the Book of Job , and these are its closing verses : '' Who setteth Capella and Achernar to be gods for a term , and a guide upon the deep to strange peoples ; Who maketh Altair and
Rigel	PERSON	the captains of His host ; Who leaneth His spear upon
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	ere the trumpets call ; Who holdeth Vega His armor-bearer , and hangeth His buckler upon
Aldebaran	ORGANIZATION	; Who hath convoked their chariots against the lamps of Evil , and their swords against the abyss .

		Who healeth the day with night , and thy heart 's wound with the hands of little children ; Even they that seek the breast in darkness , hushing the voices that were aforetime .

		The wind cometh , the dust is troubled for a season , but hath rest when the wind departeth . '' ''

		The
House of Orchids	ORGANIZATION	and Other Poems '' is the title of the noteworthy volume from which the above quotations have been taken .

		There are forty-two of Mr.
John Myers O'Hara	PERSON	's '' Pagan Sonnets , '' prefaced by a confession of pagan faith -LRB- with several misprints -RRB- quoted from
Gautier	PERSON	.

		`` Valor '' is the sonnet which has given us the greatest pleasure .

		106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, '' Not now , my soul , must thou turn craven thing , And cede thy conquered lands as death 's domain !

		Are life 's grim fields of battle void of gain And the old reckless ardor wavering ?

		No fear to thee should any menace bring ; The world 's grey lies fell foiled from thy disdain , Its blades of hate have met thy steel in vain ; An epinikion is thine to sing !

		What !

		like a boy to blanch with battle fear Nor chafe the hours that lag before the fray ?

		I scorn the thought as Spartan would the sin .

		My blood mounts bold as creeps the conflict near , And lone upon that last
Thermopylae	LOCATION	, I wait the combat none may hope to win . ''

		These sonnets are boldly chiselled , and rich in verbal beauties .

		They exhibit also , we regret to say , occasional verbal infelicities , and there is at times a straining for effect that jars their harmony .

		But they are fairly deserving of the author of the Gappho paraphrase , as well as of the luxurious form in which they are printed .

		The late
Herbert Muller Hopkins	PERSON	was a college professor , and the author of two or three readable novels .

		He also wrote verses for various magazines , and these have now been collected by his widow into a book .

		They are pleasing verses , embodying trim sentiments tastefully expressed , the work of a scholarly and cultivated mind .

		The following is a typical example : '' I stood in dreams beside the gate , Where'er that gate may be , Where souls released from earth 's estate Pass on eternally From out this whirl of strife and hate On death 's untroubled sea . ''

		From battle-field and flood , and fire , And lingering beds of pain , Purged of importunate desire , And white without a stain , I saw them pass , an endless choir , Hymning a glad refrain . ''

		The aged man , his youth renewed , The child with wondering eyes , The youth with flaming hopes endued , Seeking a high emprise Winging on happy certitude The pathway of the skies . ''

		In lighter mood , the author celebrates the virtues of man 's chief solace : '' Had
Horace	PERSON	known tobacco 's pleasure He never would have wasted measure And wealth of epithet divine , On Lydian maid and Massic wine , For smoking brings us twice the gladness , Without the headache or the madness . ''

		When Thaliarchus brought the cup , And
Horace	PERSON	heaped the driftwood up , When all without was night and snow , And all within was cheerful glow , Their happiness , though great indeed , Still lacked the comfort of the weed . ''

		Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	also made acceptable bits of transla - tion from the classics , including the '' Pervigilium Veneris . ''

		A long hexameter poem on '' The
Third Day	DATE	at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	'' stands in the forefront of Miss
Helen Gray Cone	PERSON	's '' Soldiers of the Light . ''

		It is followed by a poem for the
Lincoln Centenary	ORGANIZATION	, from which we quote one section : '' Last , all his duty done , All the dark bondmen freed , The long-sought leader found , the piteous victory won , Arrived for him one hour of
April	DATE	sun Wherein he breathed free as the forest again , In glad goodwill to men Nursing some vast forgiveness in his mind .

		Then all turned blank and blind .

		Dare we remember the tragic lilac-time Crimsoned with that mad crime ?

		Nay , hush !

		Ye have heard how sacrifice must close The supreme service ; ' t is the way God chose . ''

		Another memorial poem is the '' Death-Tryst '' piece in terza rima upon the passing of Tennyson . ''

		One slept a sacred sleep , while golden lay Autumnal moonlight glorious on his bed , Sleep ebbing deathward like a sea-drawn bay . ''

		A Book was in his hand , whence late he read Majestic words of that great Spirit that still Doth haunt by Avon April-garlanded . ''

		So sleeping , held he fast with fixed will His Master 's Sook ; and all the
night	TIME	was peace , Bright peace on lawn and terrace , dale and hill . ''

		Calm consummation , and most sweet surcease !

		That tryst of sovereign powers Death would not wrong , Shattering the bars with all-too-rough release , But softly dealt .

		They rule in splendor long , Large lights , a moon and sun in
England	LOCATION	's heaven of song . ''

		The following beautiful sonnet on '' The Common Street '' must be added to our examples : '' The common street climbed up against the sky , Gray meeting gray ; and wearily to and fro I saw the patient , common people go , Each with his sordid burden trudging by .

		And the rain dropped ; there was not any sigh Or stir of a live wind ; dull , dull and slow All motion ; as a tale told long ago The faded world ; and creeping night drew nigh . ''

		Then burst the sunset , flooding far and fleet , Leavening the whole of life with magic leaven .

		Suddenly down the long wet glistening hill Pure splendor poured and lo !

		the common street , A golden highway into golden heaven , '' ^ With the dark shapes of men ascending still . ''

		Miss
Cone	ORGANIZATION	is too true a poet to have remained so long voiceless , and we welcome this new volume taking us by surprise after these many years of silence .

		The delicate fancy of Miss
Anne Cleveland Cheney	PERSON	's poems may be appropriately illustrated by `` The Mist '' : `` I fall , I fold The hill , the wold , In closely clinging , cool embraces ; I bathe the lifted flower-faces , I spread the lawn with fairy laces And show all Nature filmy-stoled . ''

		I form , I float , A wraith-like boat Among the mere-side 's long , lush grasses ; In torn and fringy-fluttering masses , I glide adown the birchen passes A gray old Lear in tattered coat .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 107 '' I wind , I wreathe A lattice , breathe Between its bars presage the
morning	TIME	, Stir Beauty with a fine , faint warning , Leave pearls , her mignonette adorning , Then steal down vines to the beds beneath . ''

		I creep , I crawl By lichened wall , And through a mournful iron grating , To where the Dead lie stilly waiting ; As one that is blind , each graven slating I trace for the name where my tears shall fall . ''

		Miss
Cheney	PERSON	's volume is entitled `` By the Sea , and Other Poems , '' and is a product of the New En - gland coast .

		The following blank verse lines may be taken to show the influence of nature upon the imaginative mind : '' There is an Attic radiance in the air ; So chaste and keen , it cuts the day as clear As some Greek marble , on the fancy 's mood A gleaming beauty and a curving grace , And glint of sandaled footsteps on the strand , While cloud-groups yonder seem to rise and shine , Like Doric ruins from the rippling blue ; And by the thrilling fragrance everywhere , I know 't is
Paestum	LOCATION	yonder , and the breath Her peerless roses , yielding up their hearts In the sea-god 's temple , and my happy soul , A censer lifted for the worshiping sweet . ''

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Not long ago , in noticing a book on < SS&S the influence of women on the poets , we pointed out that much might be done to clear up the whole question of woman 's influence in literature .

		There is now a prospect of this being accomplished .

		Professor
J. B. Fletcher	PERSON	has gathered together several essays on platonic love , under the title of the first one , '' The Religion of Beauty in Woman '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; and he states in his preface that they are '' chapters of a possible literary history of Woman . ''

		Platonic love is per - haps one of the most curious and interesting of the numerous spheres of influence that have brought woman into the field of literature .

		It became a cult in the Italian Renaissance , but its origins go back to Plato on the one hand and to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and Plotinus on the other .

		From being a religion in
Dante	LOCATION	and the great souls of the Renaissance , such as
Castiglione	PERSON	and
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	, with their sensuous and spiritual love of beauty , it degenerated into the institution of the cicesbeo in
Italy	LOCATION	, the H6tel Ram - bouillet in
France	LOCATION	, and the '' new religion in love '' at the Court of
Charles I. Dante	PERSON	's love for
Beatrice	PERSON	was a variety of religious experience .

		She was the mouthpiece of God , and the means of salvation ; the goal of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's spiritual journey is spontaneous self-surrender and perfect self-renunciation .

		Love is a self-effacing homage .

		It is a far cry from this , or from
Castiglione	PERSON	's power in ourselves that makes for righteousness , to the platonic love of the Stuart court , which was for the most part masked profli - gacy ; but the former will explain the '' Astrophel to Stella '' sonnets of
Sidney	PERSON	.

		Professor
Fletcher	PERSON	shows that they are the expression of the devotion of the '' servant '' to his mistress .

		They do not cele - brate a vulgar liaison , nor are they an exercise in imitation of a prevailing mode .

		Stella is the '' star of love , seen first as woman , then as God , '' who leads the lover to overcome the baleful power of Desire , and to '' rise above even purified love of mortal beauty to the love of the divine ' elements ' themselves of beauty in God . ''

		Such an inter - pretation should set at rest Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's jealousy for
Sidney	PERSON	's reputation , and show
M. Jusserand	PERSON	that a poet may write very eloquently of love without a gen - uine passion being the basis of his fervent poetry .

		Of distinct interest to all of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's on Ruski admirers , and perhaps of more value even than a new biography , is Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's ``
Ruskin	PERSON	, a Study in Personality '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , the seven chapters of which were deliv - ered as lectures at
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in
1910	DATE	.

		They are not changed in form or style , and their author claims for his work only the merit of a sketch , not that of a finished portrait .

		The book , however , is more than a sketch ; it is , indeed , a study in personality , keen and clear in its account - ing of
Ruskin	PERSON	as a man , as a vital force in
England	LOCATION	's life , the spirit of the man weighing infinitely more in the scale of values than the dogma or criticism for which he was responsible .

		It is Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's idea that
Ruskin	PERSON	's peculiar temperament was due to his Lowland Scotch descent -LRB- he was three-fourths Lowland Scotch -RRB- ; and certain it is that the strenu - ous Biblical training of his youth , which had such influence upon his character and his style , was a direct consequence of this descent .

		The important point in our comprehension of
Ruskin	LOCATION	is that we should recognize that he was preeminently a moral - ist .

		He was not a critic of art in any strict sense , nor a poet in a freer sense , expressing himself in prose , but a moralist philosophizing on art , dealing with the ethics of art , always in search of moral ideas .

		Toward
Ruskin	PERSON	and his teaching , Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- son 's attitude is that of reverent discipleship ; but he is not the less sensitive to his master 's limitations
Ruskin	PERSON	is `` a great guide but an unsafe ruler . '' ''

		Art has now learned that
Ruskin	PERSON	was right -LSB- in ' Modern Painters ' -RSB- , but not exclusively right . '

		On the other side , of course , the author is intensely sympathetic with
Ruskin	PERSON	's ideals , and impressively eloquent in his appreciation of the virtue and value of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		The author of `` The Upton Letters '' has now a wide circle of responsive read ers who will welcome this volume not so much because it deals with
Ruskin	PERSON	as because it is Mr
Benson	PERSON	's latest work .

		There is much to please and stimulate the reader in this little book .

		What , for instance , does Mr.
Benson	PERSON	himself think about Art He tells us here ; he even hazards what , in its way might serve for a definition : '' Art , '' he says , '' is nothing but the love of beauty finding utterance .

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, And dicta of this nature are abundant in these well-filled pages .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's delightful manner of expression hardly needs description .

		His quiet , incisive style , so temperate yet so confident , com - forts -LRB- as a New Testament writer would say -RRB- the reader .

		It is not the occasional passages of grace - ful eloquence , but the easy attitude of dignity and self-command , the quiet tone , the friendly flow of frankness , that give his style its distinctive charm The latest account of Russian Tur '' kestan comes from the pen of Mr.
William Eleroy Curtis	PERSON	, and , as might be expected , the keen observations of this trained and travelled journalist make the book , `` Turkestan , the Heart of
Asia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a most readable volume .

		A wonderful wealth of history and romance is associated with
Merv	PERSON	and
Khiva	LOCATION	,
Bokhara	LOCATION	and
Samarkand	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	gives a striking account of the wretched state of the sur - vivors of former greatness . ''

		All the imposing structures that once gave
Samarkand	LOCATION	its reputation as the finest city in
Asia	LOCATION	have either disappeared or are in an advanced stage of decay and dilapida - tion .

		They have been almost entirely stripped of the adornments that made them famous , and the earthquakes that occur every few years diminish the number of turquoise and az ` ure domes and the dimensions of the enamelled walls , and increase the heaps of debris which now cover the ground . ''

		No less interesting will be the account of the rapid development of Turkestan since the Russian occupa - tion .

		Cotton-growing is the great industry , there at present .

		Half the Russian consumption comes from
Turkestan	LOCATION	, and in time she hopes to be free from all dependence on the
United States	LOCATION	, although American seed and machinery have been used in the development of the industry .

		It is a bit surpris - ing to learn that in the capital of
Tamerlane	LOCATION	`` men go about the streets on those nuisances called motor - cycles .

		There are two or three garages with wide - open doors , and the toot-toot-toot of the automobiles makes you jump every now and then while you are crossing the street . ''

		Much of the book is , of course , devoted to ancient Turkestan , to
Tamerlane	LOCATION	and his times ; but its real value lies in the account of present conditions along the line of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's travels .

		The excellent illustrations are from photo - graphs by Mr.
John T. McCutcheon	PERSON	.

		Latin and Greek II is a noteworthy fact that a pow - in American erful defense of Latin and Greek education .

		should come from one of our great State universities of the middle West .

		We refer to the volume of '' Humanistic Papers '' coming from the
Macmillan	PERSON	press among the publications of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, and bearing the special title of `` Latin and Greek in American Education . ''

		The idea of these papers was conceived by Professor
Francis W. Kelsey	PERSON	, in connection with the Classical Conferences held under his leadership for a good many years past as a part of the programme of the
Michigan Schoolmasters ' Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The body of the volume consists of seven symposia , dealing respect - ively with the relation of classical studies to medi - cine , engineering , the law , theology , practical affairs , the new education , and formal discipline .

		These symposia , presented at various Classical Confer - ences , are preceded in the volume by three chapters from the pen of Professor Kelsey himself , and one from Professor
R. M. Wenley	PERSON	, who from the chair of Philosophy has always extended the most hearty support to his classical colleagues in the faculty at
Ann Arbor	LOCATION	.

		The symposia themselves have been previously published , partly in `` The School Review '' and the remainder in '' The Educational Review . ''

		Two of them those dealing with the benefit of classical studies to students of medicine and engi - neering have had the honor of publication in
Germany	LOCATION	, in a translation by Professor
von Arnim	PERSON	, of the
University of Vienna	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to be hoped that in this more permanent form , with the added attraction of the excellent introductory chapters by Professors Kelsey and Wenley , they will receive renewed attention and do their appropriate share in fostering sounder ideas of culture than are gener - ally prevalent in American education of the '' up to date '' variety .

		A compendium Henceforth , no more talk of '' strug - of literary g ' in g authors ; or , at least , if the experience .

		phrase does not vanish from our speech it will not be for lack of an exhaustive set - ting forth of the conditions of successful writing .

		The three hundred and sixty pages of Colles and
Cresswell	PERSON	's `` Success in Literature '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- are go comprehensive in scope and so replete with sane and measured utterance that the reader marvels at the way in which a compilation is made to give the impression of perfect familiarity on the part of its writers with every form of literary effort .

		Poetry , to be sure , is not included in their instruction , presumably for the reason that they realize the audacity of attempting to penetrate the mysteries of the thankless Muse ; but every form of prose literature -LRB- or perhaps it would be better to say writing , for the tendency of the book is slightly toward considering the business , rather than the art , of writing -RRB- is so learnedly and lucidly and wisely discussed , and the work so abounds in counsel derived directly from the pens of authors in all tongues , ancient and modern , and indirectly from the record of their successes and failures , that it might well be called a compendium of literary expe - rience .

		Every aspirant to literary success will find recorded in its pages many of his own thoughts and experiences .

		He will also find himself regaled with plenty of advice , which seems to have been framed expressly for himself ... so much , indeed , that if he attempts to follow it all , or any consider - able part of it , he will be impelled to the conclusion to borrow a clause from the book itself that '' his natural abilities are in danger of being para - lyzed by a plethora of salutary admonitions . ''

		THE DIAL 109 Eleven years ago Mrs.
Alice Willard Solenberger	PERSON	-LRB- then Miss Willard -RRB- was placed in charge of the Central Dis - trict of the
Chicago Bureau of Charities	ORGANIZATION	, and there she made a careful study of the homeless men who in large numbers applied to her for aid .

		Her investi - gations are now published under the auspices of the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	in a handy volume entitled '' One Thousand Homeless Men '' -LRB- Charities Publi - cation
Committee	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Mrs.
Solenberger	PERSON	's death last
December	DATE	made necessary an explanatory preface to her work from another hand ; and this is written by Mr.
Francis H. McLean	PERSON	, who tells us , among other things , that '' she believed that the personality-by-personality method of the charity organization movement had been too little used with homeless men and boys , and that until we employ this method with them , neither our theories regard - ing vagrancy nor our efforts to reduce it will be based upon a solid foundation of knowledge . ''

		In the body of the book we have a most careful analysis of the records of one thousand homeless men , indi - cating as far as possible the causes of this homeless - ness , the characteristics of the men , their individual treatment , their environment , and the social reme - dies to be applied .

		Appended matter gives further details , tabulated statistics , and some photogravure illustrations of lodging-house interiors .

		It is note - worthy how many of Mrs.
Solenberger	PERSON	's vagrants were first made such by the unquenchable wander - lust that seizes upon nearly all of us at some time in our lives .

		The romantic youngster chases the rain - bow , and ere long finds himself in a municipal lodging-house .

		The novelist and story-writer , as well as the charity - worker , can find much valuable raw material in Mrs.
Solenberger	PERSON	's book .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Jethro Bithell	PERSON	is an exceptionally good translator of poetry a fact to which we have called attention in mentioning his volume of selections from the
Minne	LOCATION	- singers .

		He now gives us -LRB-
Scott	PERSON	-RRB- a volume of transla - tions from '' Contemporary Belgian Poetry , '' in which we have examples from a score of poets whose very names , excepting those of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Verhaeren	PERSON	, are almost unknown to English readers .

		His poets are
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	and Walloons in about equal numbers , but they all write in French .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish , in pretty gift form , a volume of `` Letters that Live , '' edited by Misses
Laura E. Lockwood	PERSON	and
Amy R. Kelly	PERSON	.

		They also send us , in their series of '' English Readings , '' a volume called '' Specimens of Letter-Writing , '' which turns out to be the same book as the other , except that in this second form it has notes for the student and an intro - duction of a more specifically educational character .

		The selection runs from the Pastors to ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, '' and fifteen Americans are represented .

		The revised edition of '' The Century Atlas , '' which will be issued with the revised '' Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia '' in
October	DATE	, well illustrates the rapid - ity with which changes are taking place on the surface of the earth .

		In order to bring the atlas down to the present time , it has been necessary to make new maps of
Western Canada	LOCATION	, the South Polar regions ,
Oklahoma	LOCATION	,
Alaska	LOCATION	,
Panama	LOCATION	, and the
North Pole	LOCATION	.

		Maps of the
North Central and North Eastern	ORGANIZATION	parts of the
United States	LOCATION	will show the main inter-urban trolley lines .

		Beginning with the age of Chaucer and
Lydgate	PERSON	,
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	has produced or inspired a great quantity of verse .

		The names related with it include many of the most famous in English poetry , among them being
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Herbert	LOCATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, Gray ,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Consequently the new `` Book of Cambridge Verse '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which Mr.
E. E. Kellett	PERSON	has edited , has no lack of material from which to select .

		The volume is a thick one , illus - trated with portraits .

		The fresher part of its contents will be found in the later pages , which give many wel - come examples of the diversions in verse of the dons of recent years .

		We have been particularly taken by Dr.
Skeats	PERSON	's parody of Chaucer in the ingenious lines to '' Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	and the Oxford Dictionary '' -LRB- from M. S. Had .

		7334 , fol .

		999 , back -RRB- .

		NOTES .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue this Fall a revised and enlarged edition of Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	's `` Mountains of
California	LOCATION	, '' with a complete new index and many illus - trations .

		Three essays by Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, which have been used as lectures and as contributions to periodi - cals , are brought together into a small volume called , '' Religion and Immortality , '' now published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that the English translation of the three volumes of
Romain Holland	PERSON	's ''
Jean Christophe	PERSON	'' which deal with the musician 's life in
Paris	LOCATION	will be published before the end of
November	DATE	.

		The title of the translation , which is by Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	, will be ''
Jean Christophe	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The
Academy of Pacific Coast History	ORGANIZATION	has just pub - lished , through the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, a text and translation of the '' Diary of Pedro Fages '' which de - scribes an expedition from
Monterey	LOCATION	to
San Francisco Bay	LOCATION	made by Lieutenant Fages in
1770	DATE	.

		The diary is edited and prefaced with an introduction by Professor
H. E. Bolton	PERSON	.

		The building of good roads should begin at school , in the opinion of Captain
S. W. Ravenal	PERSON	,
C.E.	LOCATION	, whose '' Road Primer for School Children '' will be published immediately by
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is intended for rural schools , and gives much useful and interesting information about the building and main - tenance of country roads .

		Within three months of publication , Mr.
Henry Snydor Harrison	PERSON	's novel '' Queed '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL of
July 16	DATE	-RRB- has reached the fifty thousand mark .

		A feature of the book 's success is the cordial reception given it by the English critics .

		The conservative
London	LOCATION	'' Spectator '' gives it almost a full-page review , and recommends it as a '' first aid to misanthropes . ''

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	have undertaken the pub - lication of a complete '' Library Edition '' of the works of
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, to be issued six volumes at a time .

		The first six , just issued , are , `` A Hazard of 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, New Fortunes , '' '' The Landlord at Lion 's Head , '' '' Literary Friends and Acquaintances , '' '' My Literary Passions , '' '' Literature and Life , '' and '' Certain De - lightful English Towns . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	writes a preface for each volume , in which he tells , in his entertaining personal way , the circumstances in which the book was written .

		As
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote a number of plays in addition to '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' there seems to be no reason why that play especially should be read by the children in our public schools .

		Jewish citizens have pro- tested against the use of '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' on the ground that it is directly calculated to promote race prejudice among those whose ages render such prejudices easily caught and hardly eradicated .

		The public schools , they claim , are the last places where anything making for such an attitude should be per - mitted . ''

		The World To-Day , ''
Chicago	LOCATION	's principal monthly magazine , has been acquired by what is called the ''
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	group '' of periodicals , and will be published hereafter in
New York	LOCATION	by the interests that control also '' The Cosmopolitan , '' '' Good Housekeeping , '' and one or two other periodicals . ''

		The World To-Day '' has been established about eight years , and has been con - ducted editorially with skill and success by Dr.
Shailer Matthews	PERSON	.

		It is the most considerable magazine
Chicago	LOCATION	has had since `` The Lakeside Monthly , '' forty years ago ; and we regret to see its transfer and removal .

		The
Trustees of Lake Forest University	ORGANIZATION	announce the second decennial competition for the
Bross Prize of	ORGANIZATION
six thousand dollars	MONEY	for a treatise '' On the connection of any practical science , or the history of our race , or the facts in any department of knowledge , with the Christian Religion . ''

		The behest was made by the late
William Bross	PERSON	, lieutenant-governor of
Illinois	LOCATION	in
1866	DATE	-
70	DATE	, as a memorial to his son
Nathaniel Bross	PERSON	.

		By its terms , the Christianity treated of by the competitors must be what is known as the evangelical type .

		The last winner of the prize was Professor
James Orr	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, of the
University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	, who wrote on '' The Problem of the Old Testament . ''

		Poetry lovers will be especially interested in the announcement of a new anthology of English poetry , which is to be among the
Fall publications of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to be the fullest and most com - prehensive of any single - volume collection now available , and will represent nearly 1100 poets with something like 3500 poems .

		The representation of American poets will be very liberal .

		By the use of
India	LOCATION	paper , th volume , although containing about 3000 pages , is expected to be kept within the limits of convenient size and weight .

		The editorial work is from the competent hands of Mr.
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	, the librarian of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Chillicothe	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The name of
Elizabeth Akers Allen	PERSON	, perhaps better known as ''
Florence Percy	PERSON	, '' will mean but little to the present generation , but older readers will regret to hear of the death of this estimable and talented woman , which occurred at her home on the
Hudson	LOCATION	, near
West Point	LOCATION	,
August 7	DATE	, in her eightieth year .

		She was a native of
Maine	LOCATION	, and began writing at an early age , and con - tinued until a few years of her death .

		Her best-known poem is probably `` Rock Me to Sleep , Mother , '' although others of her pieces were doubtless superior in literary quality .

		Mrs.
Allen	PERSON	was a contributor to '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' and was the author of a number of books , | among which are '' Forest Buds from the Woods of
Maine	LOCATION	, ''
1855	DATE	; Poems , 1866-8-9 ; `` Two Saints , ''
1888	DATE	; `` The High-Top Sweeting , ''
1891	DATE	; `` The Proud Lady of Stavoren , ''
1897	DATE	; '' The Ballad of the
Bronx	LOCATION	, ''
1901	DATE	; '' The Sunset Song , ''
1903	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Allen	PERSON	's family name was Chase .

		Her first husband was
Paul Akers	PERSON	, the sculptor .

DENTON J. SNIDER	PERSON	Of deep interest to all thinking people , the salient character of
Universal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	may be indicated in the fact that it is neither metaphysical nor physical in method or matter , but purely psychological .

		Slowly the science of Psychology has been pushing to the front as the
Universal Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it has been hitherto handicapped by alien methods foisted upon it .

		So we have had chiefly two kinds : the old Rational -LRB- so - called -RRB- Psychology , dominated by the metaphysical system of some phil - osopher , and the more recent
Psychological Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, dominated by the procedure of
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present system maintains a view opposite to , yet inclusive of both these methods .

		Psychology is proclaimed the master of the house , no longer the subordinate ; it is to organize Philosophy and
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	, and not to be organized by them .

		It is the new
Universal Science	ORGANIZATION	and openly asserts itself as a system in spite of to-day 's pragmatic prejudice against all systems .

		The only work of this kind wrought out to completion in the English language .

		140 `` A SAD ANACREON . ''

		It is just a hundred years since
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	was born , and almost forty since he died , his work acclaimed by many fellow-singers , among whom
Swinburne	PERSON	was chief .

		`` All joys and wonders of old lives and new That ever in love 's shine or shadow grew , And all the grief whereof he dreams and grieves , And all sweet roots fed on his light and dew ; '' All these through thee our spirit of sense perceives , As threads in the unseen woof thy music weaves , Birds caught and snared that fill our ears with thee , Bay-blossoms in thy wreath of brow-bound leaves . ''

		Since these memorial verses were penned , we have had time to think the matter over , and the question arises : How much of this is rhetorical adulation , how much genuine emotion that still has power to evoke a responsive thrill ?

		The fashions of French literature have changed many times since
Gautier	PERSON	lived almost as fre - quently as the fashions in hats and gowns ; they changed radically during the poet 's own lifetime .

		How much of his work has the quality that makes poetry survive despite its accidents ?

		This is the question which we are bound to ask concerning any writer when his first centenary comes round ; and we are bound also to find for it some kind of an answer .

		According to the estimates of those indefa - tigable bibliographers , MM .

		Bergerat and
Spoel	PERSON	- berch de Louvenjoul ,
Gautier	PERSON	wrote enough matter poetry , romance , criticism , travel to fill at least three hundred volumes .

		It was a fair achievement for one who posed as a poitrinaire , although
Dumas	PERSON	boasted of three or four times as much ; but of course no such quantity of work can possibly be handed down by any one man to a later generation except as stuff to be piled up in the lumber-rooms of the libraries .

		It was mostly journalism , as its author would have been free to admit ; and he could have had no idea that posterity would interest itself in more than a small fraction of the total .

		The great mass of this writing was of the most ephemeral sort criticism of books and plays and paintings that have passed out of memory , and carried with them all the comment which they occasioned .

		What
Gautier	PERSON	had to say about them is of no more value than what Poe 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, had to say about the fifth-rate American writers that he was called upon to examine in his day 's work .

		Nuggets of critical thought are imbedded in the matrix , no doubt , but
Gautier	PERSON	left us so much pure gold that we do not need to add to the hoard by pickings and sif tings from the scrap - heap of his tailings .

		We may leave that task to the biographer , whose duty it is to allow no material to go unexamined ; the general reader and amateur of literature will find his sufficient account in the treasures which the poet consci - ously wrought into works of art .

		The sugges - tion of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	in this connection is instructive , for both the French and the American poet used the same media , and in the really immortal parts of their work were inspired by the same devotion to the purest and most austere of poetical ideals .

		In the two cases we have something like the same proportion say ten to one between what is forgotten and what is cherished , and the same antipodal difference in artistic quality .

		Gautier was so picturesque a figure , partic - ularly in his early years , that he has remained ever since the victim of his own legend .

		The image of him which remains vivid in our memory is invested with the red waistcoat , despite his assertion that he never wore it but once , and that it was not a red waistcoat at all , but a rose-colored doublet . ''

		Gentlemen , this is very important .

		The red waistcoat would have meant the color of republican politics .

		But there was nothing of the sort .

		We were simply mediaeval .

		We represented the machicolation party , and that was all . ''

		Gautier , indeed , had special reasons for not blessing the republican agitation .

		His father , a pronounced legitimist , promptly played the stock market for a rise when the
July	DATE	Revolution broke out , and lost all his fortune .

		This was the very moment in which Theo 's modest volume of '' Poesies '' was published , and the Parisians were too excited to buy it .

		The poet , in consequence , was forced to make a living by resorting to journalism .

		His early verses , however , had found favor with Sainte-Beuve , who said , '' there is a man who sculptures in granite and not in smoke , '' and took him to call on Hugo .

		This is
Mirecourt	LOCATION	's story , but it seems that the introduction to the Master was really made by
Gerard de Nerval	ORGANIZATION	.

		The excitement about '' Hernani '' occurred early in
1830	DATE	, some months before the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion .


Gautier	PERSON	was the acknowledged leader of the romantic guard of young men who took pos - session of the
House of Moliere	ORGANIZATION	on that memor - able day , and hurled defiance at the old guard of the classicists .

		Those were the days of long hair and fantastic garb and striking equipages the days when Byronism was all the fashion , and the consuming ambition of ingenuous youth was to epater le bourgeois .

		To be Byronic meant , among other things , to be gloomy and consumptive , which was rather a joke in the case of Theo , who was chubby , red-cheeked , and square-shouldered .

		Naturally , this pose and these eccentricities created a legend , from which it is now difficult to disengage the actual man .

		This early phase was soon outgrown , and under the pressure of necessity
Gautier	PERSON	grew into the serious literary craftsman , vigorous in health and curious about life , who could de - scribe himself as `` a man for whom the eternal world exists . ''

		He was a leader always , and when he emerged from the romantic fog he carried French literature with him into the clear air of realism , little dreaming of the degraded interpretation of that concept which would be made by his successors .

		For his realism was something more artistic , not less , than his romanticism had ever been .

		It was his true bent all the time ; and it meant not only clear-sightedness , but also severity and restraint .

		In prose , it enabled him to produce those classics of travel , the book which describes his visits to
Spain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	, and his journey to Con - stantinople and the .

		East , besides the marvellous contes , and `` Le Capitaine Fracasse , '' that masterpiece of joyous historical romance .

		In poetry , it was the inspiration of the delicately - graven art of the '' Emaux et Camees , '' which is as sure of immortality as anything in French literature .

		He learned the full meaning of toil , and , in the work which was not frankly journey - man 's labor , his aim was nothing less than per - fection .

		He had many shocks , and bore them bravely ; and his mien became grave , impassive , and almost Olympian . ''

		It makes you look like Homer , '' said one of the Goncourts at sight of a recently-engraved portrait . ''

		At the best , a sad Anacreon , '' was his response .

		He lived in
Paris	LOCATION	through the Siege and the Commune , and died a year later , at the age of sixty .

		Even in his prose ,
Gautier	PERSON	was essentially a poet .

		Says
M. Emile Henriot	PERSON	, to whose deeply sympathetic appreciation in the '' Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' we are indebted for much that we have already related : '' He loved poetry for itself , and not for what may be put into it , whether dramatic effect , declamation , phil - osophy , eloquence , demagogic dream , or socialism .

		He loved poetry for itself , for the music of rhythm , the color of words , for its periodic architecture and imma - terial imagery , for the vast and profound beauty of its responses all art is responsive to his dreams ...
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 He did not rhyme to prove God 's existence , to measure the infinite , to codify love , to extol liberty , equality , and the sovereign people ... No , he sang because sing - ing was pleasant , and if it happened that in his verses he came upon God , Love , and the Infinite , it is because these are inseparable elements of all poetry . ''

		This is a fair statement of the doctrine of Vart pour Vart as it was exemplified in
Gautier	PERSON	's practice , and it does not mean that he was un Con - cerned about life and its graver issues .

		Pursuing his artist 's task in the spirit of that poem which is probably the best-known of all his shorter pieces , he was at heart preoccupied with the problems that other poets make free to discuss in their work .

		Especially was he obsessed by the enigma of man 's destiny , and the question put to Faust poring over a manuscript in the '' Comedie de la Mort '' is the question that remained uppermost in
Gautier	PERSON	's own mind throughout his later years . ''

		Quel sable , quel corail a ramene ' ta sonde ?

		As-tu touche '' le fond des sagesses du monde , En puisant a ton puits ?

		Nous as-tu dans ton seau fait monter toute nue La blanche ve ` rite ' jusqu ' ici me ` connue ?

		Arbre , ou sont done tes fruits ? ''

		But neither
Faust	ORGANIZATION	nor
Don Juan	PERSON	nor
Napoleon	PERSON	can supply the inquiring spirit with the word of the enigma .

		This the poet is honest enough to admit ; but he does not for that abandon his spiritual quest , and his thirst for the infinite can not be wholly slaked at the fountain of art .

		It is a grateful refuge by the wayside , but it is not the summit which is the goal of the pilgri - mage .

		For Theo , the summit was veiled in mists ; but he never lost the intuition of its shining glory .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A LIBRARY OF MAGNIFICENT DISTANCES , like the palatial structure recently opened for the use of the
New York	LOCATION	public , has its obvious disadvantages .

		When a hurry-up order is given at the delivery desk for a book half a block away , the desired volume is pretty sure not to be forthcoming with sufficient celerity to satisfy the applicant .

		A courteous com - plainant writes a letter to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' mildly deploring the necessity of such long waits as have fallen to his share in his enjoyment of the splendid facilities of the finest public library in the world .

		Four hours ' enforced contemplation of its interior splendors while one or two volumes of '' The Liberator '' were being fetched in response to an order , certainly seems excessive ; but perhaps more trying than that to a sensitive soul is to be informed , after a long interval of hopeful expect - ancy , that one 's application slip is lost , and will one please make out another .

		These and other patience - trying occurrences , as recorded by the letter-writer , call to mind the mediaeval methods still employed at many of the great libraries of
Europe	LOCATION	, where the interval between the asking for and the getting of a book may be as much as half a day , or even a whole day .

		However , the machinery of an immense new library should not be expected to get into per - fect running order too soon ; and although the com - plainant makes pertinent reference to '' the relative inefficiency of municipal as compared with individ - ual conduct of business , '' we must not yet lose hope of better things in the way of speed and accuracy on the part of the vast bibliothecal plant at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street .

		THE INDEX EXASPERATORIUS IN LIBRARIES is distinguished by its fondness for the vicious circle of cross-reference .

		The vicious circle of cross - reference , known with sorrow to every librarian , cataloguer , bibliographer , and other literary work - man conversant with the tools of his trade , may be illustrated by the following example from '' Who 's Who in the Social Swim . ''

		Wishing to learn the maiden name of the young
Countess of Sweetwater	ORGANIZATION	, we turned of course to ``
Sweetwater	LOCATION	'' in its alpha - betical place , but were there referred to ''
Jones	PERSON	,
Launcelot Pilkington	PERSON	. ''

		Scanning with a sigh the long list of Joneses , we at last found , under Jones ,
L. Pilkington	PERSON	, '' see Pilkington-Jones , Launcelot . ''

		Thereupon we chased the alphabet down to P , and were rewarded with overtaking , in its proper place , '' Pilkington-Jones , family name of the Earls of
Sweetwater	LOCATION	, '' which started us back to our original caption before we became conscious of the vicious circle in which we were involved .

		A playful edit - orial note in a current journal , commenting on the Index Exasperatorius , suggests a way in which it can be turned to good account in the cultivation of equanimity . ''

		Make a sport of this irritating trick of the reference works , and their teeth are drawn .

		This , and not chess , is the great game of scholars in the future .

		When the track teams are getting together for cross-country meets , the scholars of the universities will be assembling for cross-reference meets , rolling up scores into three figures . ''

		But the grievance of the writer quoted seems to end with cross-references that do ultimately , however circuitously , lead the searcher to the desired goal .

		It is the cross-reference gyroscope , the cat pursuing its own tail , that makes us dizzy and peevish .

		ANOTHER VERSION OF THE
BARBARA FRIETCHIE	PERSON	LEGEND comes to notice with the death , in
Balti	LOCATION	- more , of
Henry Clay Naill	PERSON	, an old-time resident of
Frederick	PERSON	, the
Maryland	LOCATION	town where , according to
Whittier	LOCATION	, the nonagenarian dame '' took up the flag the men hauled down , '' and '' leaned far out on the window-sill , and shook it forth with a royal will . ''

		Mr.
Naill	PERSON	, who was wont to claim that he had known
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	from his infancy , and had sat in her lap many a time , was quite clear as to what really occurred on that day when the Confederate 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, troops came marching into
Frederick	PERSON	town .

		Thirsty with their march , some of
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's men entered
Barbara	PERSON	's garden without permission and drank from her well , whereupon she , from the porch where she was churning , bade them begone .

		At this , two of the intruders advanced to the porch and made as if they would partake of her buttermilk , but retired with their fellows amid much laughter when she opened upon them with a volley of mingled English and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch .

		It was Mrs.
Quantrell	PERSON	, further down the street , who , with an eye to dramatic effect , ran to her front gate and waved a small American flag , but received no atten - tion from the soldiery beyond a few derisive saluta - tions and some good-natured chaff .

		The conflicting Frietchie and
Quantrell	ORGANIZATION	claims to fame have long been subjects of debate , but it was left to Mr.
Naill	PERSON	to exhibit both women in no very heroic light , the one as a shrew and the other as a person clutching at a little cheap glory with no danger whatever to her own person .

		Nevertheless the
Whittier	LOCATION	version makes a fine poem , and Dame
Barbara	PERSON	will not easily be shorn of the renown she has so long enjoyed .

		A LIBRARY REPORT IN RHYME has Come Out of the poetically beautiful Berkshire hills , and though the librarian , Mr.
Harlan JL Ballard	PERSON	, of the
Berk	PERSON	- shire Athenaeum -LRB- the public library of
Pittsfield	LOCATION	-RRB- , may not have written himself into the distinguished company of such poet-librarians as
Miss Ina	ORGANIZATION	D. Coolbrith , Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	, and the late
Sam Walter Foss	PERSON	, he has nevertheless done an orig - inal thing , and , considering the unpoetic nature of his subject matter , 4one it rather well .

		Of the library 's book-loaning activities we read : '' The circulation last year , I see , Was 91,073 ; We have added this year to the former score
8530	DATE	more .

		The total number this year will be 99,603 . ''

		March has led for many a year In the number of books delivered here ; But now , as we shall long remember , The largest total was last
November	DATE	.

		The weather was cold , the winds were shifty , And the count was
9250	DATE	. ''

		There are doubtless more sides to Mr.
Ballard	PERSON	than have yet been exposed to public view .

		Years ago his inventive skill earned for him the gratitude of his fellow-librarians by the production of a metal clip that has the grip of a bulldog , and that will hold pamphlets , periodicals , or loose sheets together till the crack of doom .

		What he shall eventually prove himself to be besides librarian , poet , and inventor , doth not yet appear .

		KING GEORGE 'S OPPORTUNITY , now that he is duly crowned and fairly seated on the throne of
England	LOCATION	, contains limitless possibilities for good .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, asking , in the
London	LOCATION	4 < Daily Mail , '' what sort of an account of itself the reign now beginning will be likely to give at its close , thus ends his series of questions : '' Will it leave a
London	LOCATION	preserved and beautified , or will it but add abundantly to the lumps of dishonest statuary , the scars and masses of ill-conceived rebuilding which testify to the aesthetic degradation of the Victorian period ?

		Will a great constellation of artists redeem the ambitious sentimentalities and genteel skilfulness that find their fitting mausoleum in theTate Gallery ?

		Will our literature escape at last from pretentious - ness and timidity , our philosophy from the foolish cerebrations of university ' characters ' and eminent politicians at leisure , and our starved science find scope and resources adequate to its gigantic needs ?

		Will our universities , our teaching , our national training , our public services , gain a new health from the reviving vigor of the national brain ?

		Or is all this a mere wild hope , and shall we , after some small flutterings of effort , the foundation of some ridiculous little academy of literary busy bodies and hangers-on , the public recognition of this or that sociological pretender or financial ' scientist , ' and a little polite jobbery with picture-buying , relapse into lassitude and a contented acquiescence in the rivalry of Ger - many and the
United States	LOCATION	for the moral , intellec - tual , and material leadership of the world ? ''

		With
America	LOCATION	, then , in part , through the stimulus of her rivalry so frankly acknowledged by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, it rests to hasten or retard the realization of his dreams .

		OVERHEARD IN
CONCORD	LOCATION	, by a
Concord	LOCATION	resident , from the lips of an exclamatory
New Jersey	LOCATION	tourist , one of a personally-conducted party : '' No wonder this place produces such geniuses as
James Whit	PERSON	- comb
Riley	PERSON	and the rest !

		I think I could write poetry myself if I lived here a while . ''

		And from another hero-worshipper : `` Please , Mr.
Lecturer	PERSON	, will you tell us when we get to Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	's home ? ''

		The megaphoned reply that `` Mrs.
Mary Baker Eddy	PERSON	lived in
Concord	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	not
Concord	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	'' tended to dispel the en - chantment of the place for certain members of the party .

		About half the strangers who come to view the '' Wayside , '' where
Hawthorne	PERSON	lived , begin to count the gables , in the vain hope of making out seven , before someone conveys a correcting hint with a proper reference to Salem ; and the other half are not unlikely to confuse the historic
Concord	LOCATION	house with the
Wayside Inn	ORGANIZATION	in another
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts town .

		But all this jumble of misinformation heightens wonderfully the charm of
summer	DATE	travel , and also gives innocent amusement to the
summer	DATE	traveller 's better-informed overhearers .

		THE SHIFTING STANDARDS OF ORTHOGRAPHY give occasion for an interesting article by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	entitled `` How Ought We to Spell ? ''

		in the
August	DATE	issue of ''
Munsey	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine . ''

		What he says of the perpetual changes in pronunciation and spelling and meaning that words
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 inevitably undergo is incontestable , as is also the fact of incessant clashing of opinion among the lexicographers , to whom we are wont to go for authoritative direction in these matters .

		And now the self-constituted spelling-reformers are adding their note to the discord .

		Probably without intend - ing it as such , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	presents one of the chief arguments against the move toward pho - netic or simplified spelling .

		Long-established pro- nunciations , he says , are ever liable to modification . ''

		At one moment a word may have a pronunciation accepted by all ; then , in time , a different pronun - ciation may begin to spread sporadically , and for a period ... there will be two contending pronun - ciations ; until at last one or the other succeeds in imposing itself '' for a longer or shorter period . ''

		Either '' and '' neither '' are among the instructive examples adduced by him .

		In another paragraph we find him asking , '' Why not write gipsy rather than the less logical gypsy ? ''

		But why is the latter less logical ?

		It points back to the original home of the swarthy-visaged wanderers , and to the kindred Latin and Greek words .

		One can not but note , with some sympathy for the author , the unreformed dress in which the printers have clothed his essay .

		THE CAUSE OF THE COLORED FOLK is to be ably defended by a new periodical , `` The Crisis , '' already well started in
New York	LOCATION	by the
National Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion for the
Advancement of Colored People	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
W. E. B. Du Bois	PERSON	, the negro writer and sociologist , is editor-in-chief , and one is glad to find Garrison blood in at least one of his corps of associates Mr.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	, historian of
John Brown	PERSON	and president of the
New York Evening Post Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to be noted , further , that 20 Vesey St. , the address of the `` Post , '' is also that of `` The Crisis , '' and that among the members of the new Association are Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	, Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	, Mr.
Jacob Schiff	PERSON	, and others of prominence and influence .

		The truth and the whole truth about the black man , and the securing of justice for him , are the primary objects of the little magazine , which also contains some matter of more general interest .

		THE STRONG PAST PARTICIPLE has a vigor and emphasis never attained by the weak .

		In the re - cent days of unprecedented heat over a large part of the north temperate zone , bow much better it satisfies the need of verbal expression to speak of oneself , after running to catch one 's suburban train , as having '' got all het up '' than as having '' become thoroughly heated . ''

		A metropolitan journal of enviable reputation for correctness in the use of language has editorially indulged in the good old Yankeeism cited above ; nor has it even felt called upon to enclose the idiom in apologetic quotation marks .

		Professor
Albert Hopkins	PERSON	of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	used to say of one of the less comfortable recitation rooms of that institution , that all it needed was to be properly het and lit to make it entirely satisfactory .

		And who would have chid him for his partiality to the strong past participle ?

		THE REAL REWARDS OF GENIUS , more specifically of literary genius , were described the other day by a labor-member of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	in a pro- test against the pending English copyright bill , as consisting in the comfort and inspiration which the author 's message gives to others .

		Hence the utter wrongness of the proposed measure to assure to the genius and his family more of the pecuniary profits of his work , at the expense of the laboring man who will have to pay a higher price for the afore-mentioned comfort and inspiration .

		Perhaps the honorable member would enjoy defending the thesis that the real rewards of the laboring man consist in the comfort and cheer his brick-laying or carpentry or plumbing or coal-mining affords to others , and that all contracts whereby he is assured a fair return for his toil are iniquitous and oppres - LITERARY HONORS TO
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	are falling thick and fast this
summer	DATE	.

		Four of her novelists figure conspicuously in the current records of book-sales .

		On recent lists of the six best-sellers are to be noted Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's war-time novel , '' The Long Roll , '' Mr.
Vaughan Kester	PERSON	's `` The Prodigal Judge , '' Mr.
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	's '' Queed , '' and Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	's `` The Miller of Old Church . ''

		Richmond claims three of these writers as residents , while
Gunston Hall	PERSON	, the old home of the Masons , was the abode of Mr.
Kester	PERSON	.

		The literary centre of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	should perhaps just now be con - sidered as located neither at the mouth of the
Charles River	LOCATION	, nor in the borough of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, nor even at the southern end of
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	, but within the boundaries of the Old Dominion and not far from the capitol building on the left bank of the
James River	LOCATION	.

		LAX GUARDIANSHIP OF VALUABLE PUBLIC DOCU - MENTS , such as has lately been made public in press despatches from
Washington	LOCATION	, ought to serve as a convincing argument for that more careful and sys - tematic custody which we recently pointed out as a need that must sooner or later receive attention .

		Within three months three important documents belonging to different departments of the govern - ment have vanished from view , all of them of im - portance perhaps uncomfortable importance to some , in connection with questions of current discus - sion and controversy .

		If the sacredness of official papers of this and other sorts is not to be made to be respected by a properly constituted guardian of public documents , with adequate quarters -LRB- fire-proof and burglar-proof -RRB- for the safe custody of his collec - tion , what limits of confusion and chaos may we not ultimately reach ?

		THE POET OF PROSTRATE
POLAND	LOCATION	.

		* The vitality of the Polish language and lit - erature , the Polish press , the Polish theatre , Polish customs and traditions in short , the Polish national spirit is something remark - able and admirable , in view of the centuries of effort to Russianize and Germanize the dismembered kingdom .

		Through it all , the Polish-speaking population , as shown by census returns , has held its own , and even some degree of Polonization of the Germans in
Poland	LOCATION	has been noted .

		The world has moved on since the final partition of Polish territory among the powerful adjacent land-grabbers , and little thought is now given by the public at large to the woes of
Poland	LOCATION	or to her possible resurrec - tion among the nations in any remote future .

		But
Poland	LOCATION	is by no means dead .

		The Poles are biding their time , we are assured , and husbanding their strength , keeping alive the national spirit , and above all seeing to it that the Polish language and literature shall not become a dead language and literature .

		Fascinating though
Poland	LOCATION	's tragic history is to all the world , we of the English tongue can not claim much familiarity with her writers and their works .

		Even manuals and compen - diums of Polish literature for English readers are almost non-existent , and satisfactory trans - lations of the Polish classics do not abound .

		The difficulties of the language may partly account for this .

		At any rate , so dissimilar are the idioms of
Pole	LOCATION	and Englishman that the two might almost be said to think on different planes .

		To contribute to our better acquaint - ance with a rich and noble literature ,
Miss Monica M. Gardner	PERSON	has prepared a biographical and descriptive work on ''
Adam Mickiewicz	PERSON	, the National Poet of
Poland	LOCATION	, '' who , as she says in her preface , though '' well known in other countries , is almost a stranger in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Equally and probably more a stranger is he in
America	LOCATION	, greatest of
Poland	LOCATION	's poets though we know him to be .

		The outward events of his life , which falls between the years
1798	DATE	and
1855	DATE	, are few and soon enumerated .

		Born near
Wilna	LOCATION	, of an old Lithuanian family that had seen better days , he was educated in his native town and at the Uni - versity of

ADAM MICKIEWICZ	PERSON	, the
National Poet	ORGANIZATION	of
Poland	LOCATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ion with the Russian authorities because of his membership in a young men 's patriotic organi - zation , he was first imprisoned and then exiled , being sent as a kind of hostage to
Russia	LOCATION	, where he remained until
1829	DATE	, when he obtained per - mission to travel , and made his way to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		His productivity as a poet seems to have ceased with his marriage in
1834	DATE	, the hard realities of his struggle for a maintenance then becoming intensified .

		A call to
Lausanne	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	as professor of classical literature was followed in less than a year by a summons back to
Paris	LOCATION	to accept the newly-established professorship of Slavonic literature at the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	, where his lectures from the first drew large audiences .

		But he was not well versed in his subject , though he knew the literature of his own country , and that of
Russia	LOCATION	up to the death of
Pushkin	LOCATION	; and he also had the misfortune to render himself obnoxious to the government by his openly proclaimed belief that the destined savior of stricken
Poland	LOCATION	was to be a
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	.

		Therefore , popular and inspiring though he was in the lecture-room , where his esthetic critiques and fine improvisations delighted his hearers , the poet-professor found himself once more confronted with the serious problem of supporting himself and his growing family , a problem afterward further complicated by the insanity of his wife .

		Religious mysticism and other aberrations played their part , too , in the poet 's own life and thought , traceable perhaps to the influence of one Towianski , a fanatic .

		Various temporary occupations somehow kept the poet and his family from starving .

		A brief term of newspaper editorship , and another short season of librarianship at the Arsenal , were followed in
1855	DATE	by an appointment as special envoy to
Constantinople	LOCATION	to gain inform - ation concerning the condition of the Christians and the quality of their education under Turkish rule , to explore the manuscript treasures of Turkish libraries , and to assist in raising a Polish legion to serve in the pay of
Turkey	LOCATION	against
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A strange mission , this , for a poet and an idealist ; but its incongruities were not to vex him long , for he died of cholera about two months after reaching
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		His tomb may now be seen in the cathedral of
Santa Croce	LOCATION	at
Cracow	LOCATION	.

		The early life of
Mickiewicz	LOCATION	, passed in a district of
Lithuania	LOCATION	that was then enjoying comparative happiness after the enemies of
Poland	LOCATION	had done their worst in the way of con - quest and dismemberment , lingered ever after in the poet 's fond remembrance and inspired
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 his noblest and most touching poems .

		An inter - preter of nature as well as a writer of patriotic verse , he has reproduced the sights and sounds of his Lithuanian woodlands in a way to chal - lenge comparision with the best of our own na - ture poets .

		Cradled into poetry by the wrongs of his country the final grand partition of
Poland	LOCATION	took place only three years before his birth , and the resettlement effected by the Con - gress of
Vienna	LOCATION	fell within his youth
Adam Mickiewicz	PERSON	found in his art a solace for grief and also a means for awakening new hope in his own breast and in that of others .

		Had he not suffered expatriation and become oppressed with the wretched cares and anxieties of a poverty-stricken domestic life , it is very unlikely that he would have so early abandoned poetry .

		From
Miss Gardner	PERSON	's opening chapter we take a scene agreeably in contrast with our later glimpses of the poet 's life : '' One of
Mickiewicz	PERSON	's brothers has left us a pleasant picture of the family gathered together in the
evening	TIME	.

		Adam is seated under the lamp , reading out the latest news of the war .

		The father , already drawing near his grave , supported by his stick walks about the room , unable to sit still for his emotion .

		The mother , at her needle , embroidering national emblems , watches her dying husband furtively with tear-dimmed eyes .

		One boy traces out the inarch of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's armies on the map .

		The others listen while busied over different tasks . ''

		Those were the poet 's happy days , as the writer observes .

		The
spring of 1812	DATE	was full of promise and smiling with hope to the Polish people .


Napoleon	PERSON	, the fondly-imagined deliverer of the oppressed land , was marching with victorious legions into
Russia	LOCATION	, and the whole Polish nation was wild with joy . ''

		God is with
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Napoleon	PERSON	is with us , '' was the watchword .

		More than twenty years later , in his great poem ''
Thaddeus	PERSON	, ''
Mickiewicz	PERSON	sang the paean of that wonderful
spring	DATE	.

		A few lines from
Miss Gardner	PERSON	's translation of a part of the poem will show what hope and joy filled every bosom . ''

		Oh ,
spring	DATE	!

		I saw thee in our land .

		Memorable spring of war ,
spring	DATE	of plenty .

		Oh
spring	DATE	, flowering with corn and grass , brilliant with men , fertile in deed , pregnant with hope !

		Born in captivity , fettered while in swaddling-bands , only one such
spring	DATE	have I known in my life . ''

		To this day the people call thee the year of plenty , and the soldier the year of war .

		To this day , the aged love to tell tales of thee , to this day song dreams of thee .

		Long wert thou heralded by heavenly marvel -LSB- a great comet visible in
1811	DATE	-RSB- and preceded by low rumours among the people .

		With the sun of
spring	DATE	some strange presentiment filled Lithuanian hearts as though before thj end of the world : some yearning expectation full of joy . ''

		Bitter was the disappointment so soon to follow , and the gloom was further intensified for the poet by the death of his father .

		But the change to university life came as a welcome distraction in
1815	DATE	.

		Brilliant success attended him throughout bis four-years course , and his strong literary and poetic bent declared itself in the production of both prose and verse for publication and for reading before student assemblies . ''

		Even at this early stage of his career , '' says the author , '' he had formed his great theory upon which he built his poetical life , that the school of the poet is that of self - sacrifice and consecration . ''

		From a char - acteristic poem of this period , an '' Ode to Youth , '' we quote a few passages in Miss
Gardner	PERSON	's rendering . ''

		Without heart , without soul , those are the nations of skeletons .

		Oh , youth , give me wings !

		Let me soar above a dead world to the heavenly country of dreams where enthusiasm works miracles , strews fresh flowers and clothes hope in golden pictures . ''

		Let he -LSB- sic -RSB- whose vision age has dimmed , bending his furrowed brow to earth , look on the world 's glebe by the limit of his darkened eyes . ''

		Oh , youth !

		Soar thou beyond the horizon 's bounds , and with the eyes of sun pierce thou the mighty multi - tudes of the human race from end to end . ''

		Oh youth !

		The nectar of life is only sweet when it is shared with others .

		The joys of heaven inebriate our hearts when they are bound together by one golden thread . ''

		Together , young friends !

		The happiness of each is the aim of all , mighty in union , in enthusiasm wise .

		Together , young friends !

		And happy is he who , fallen in the midst of his career , makes with his dead body a rung of the ladder for others to reach the garden of glory .

		Together , young friends !

		Although the road be slippery and steep , and violence and weakness forbid the entrance , let violence hurl violence back , and let us learn to conquer weakness while we are young . ''

		Among other poems described and in part translated by the biographer , `` The Ancestors , '' '' The Books of the
Polish Nation	ORGANIZATION	and of the Polish Pilgrimage , '' and the already-mentioned epic `` Thaddeus , '' which is considered the poet 's masterpiece , deserve especial mention .

		As proof of the present continuance of
Mickiewicz	PERSON	's fame , and as promise of his immortality , the writer cites the fact that '' in the late Russo-Japanese war , ' The Book of the Polish Pilgrimage ' was found on the dead bodies of the Polish soldiers , pathetic testimony to the undying love for their country of the sons of
Poland	LOCATION	who fell by thou - sands in a quarrel not their own . ''

		The tone of the older and saddened
Mickie	PERSON	- wicz , as shown by a letter to his brother
Francis	PERSON	in
1833	DATE	, is not that of his buoyant and hopeful youth , but is indicative of a sober and manly fortitude , not unmixed with stoicism , that was 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, to carry him through to the end of his troubled life .

		He writes : '' I see you will not soon reconcile yourself to your fate , and that you are not as yet accustomed to be sick with yearning , which sickness certainly lasts always , but which also has its crisis , its high-water mark , and then becomes a chronic , slow disease .

		I know no way in which I can in any way hammer out of your head anxiety for the future .

		Reflect that the future can not be worse , and changing can only better it . ''

		To a friend we find him writing at this time : '' You have not profited from my company .

		When did you ever see me thinking about the future ?

		If I had a loving wife , I do not believe I should think even about the next hour , but I should rest entirely in the present . ''

		Dis - appointment in love had been added to other and less personal sorrows to induce the calm - ness of despair which seems to speak in some of his utterances .

		The girl whom he had early wished to marry , and who reciprocated his affec - tion , was forced by family considerations to wed another man , whose wealth would succor her impoverished parents .

		The young woman whom he finally made his wife seems to have been devoted to him , though it is little of conjugal bliss that we seem to find in the poet 's home in a strange land .

		His golden years were those of poetic productivity in his youth and early prime .

		A pathetic figure , on the whole , like his own afflicted country , must be his image in our minds , but beautiful with the consecrating touch of a high ideal and a brave and generous purpose .

		Miss
Gardner	PERSON	's book supplies a felt need , though it makes no claim to completeness as a biography .

		The striking features of
Mickie	PERSON	- wicz 's life and work are dwelt upon , and perhaps that is all we ought to ask for in any study of the poet .

		Authentic sources of information she has found in some abundance in his own tongue , especially in the four-volume biography of the poet by his son , Mr.
Ladislas Mickiewicz	PERSON	.

		The original translations from the poems are abund - ant and welcome , though , as may have been observed , the translator 's preoccupation with the difficult Polish has at times dulled her ear or eye to the felicities of English .

		The book as a whole , presenting in attractive form the most interesting facts concerning a highly interesting as well as noble character , and enriched with a sympathetic study of his works , deserves com - mendation .

		A portrait in photogravure faces the title-page , and a bibliography and an index complete the volume .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		LEE AXD LiONGSTREET AT
GETTYSBURG	LOCATION	.

		* Captain
Beecham	PERSON	, an officer in an
Iowa	LOCATION	regi - ment in the Civil War , has written a volume containing the results of his studies and obser - vations of the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, which he considers the pivotal battle of the war .

		The present reviewer , who was an officer in the Con - federate army , and was on the field at
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg , has read the book twice , with uncommon interest .

		He considers it a very intelligent and readable account of the battle , but he can not concur in some of the author 's judgments and opinions .

		The latter seems to follow Longstreet too closely in his view of Confederate affairs ; whereas the writer of this review considers Long - street himself chiefly responsible for the loss of that battle by the Confederates .

		He does not , however , praise General
Lee	PERSON	's conduct of the battle unreservedly .

		He has often thought that if '' Old Stonewall '' had commanded on the left , instead of
Ewell	ORGANIZATION	, there would have been no bat - tle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	: one hour of
Jackson	PERSON	on the
afternoon	TIME	of
July 1	DATE	would have transferred the
Pipe Creek	ORGANIZATION	engagement to some other place .

		Longstreet 's unwillingness to fight at
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg should have excluded him from command on that field .

		His unaccountable delay in begin - ning the battle of the second of
July	DATE	allowed time for the arrival of reinforcements which an earlier opening would have made unavailable .

		Pickett 's division arrived on the field about midday of
July 1	DATE	not , as Captain Beecham states , '' during the night of the second '' -LRB- page 53 -RRB- , for the reviewer well remembers riding to see his cousin , General
Garnett	PERSON	, who had been in an ambulance all that morning .

		The author puts
Pickett	PERSON	's arrival a day too late .

		It is a question whether
Sickles	PERSON	's advanced position on the 2nd was a gain or loss to the Federals .

		It would appear to have been more of a gain , for otherwise Longstreet 's men would probably have taken Little Round Top before
Warren	PERSON	could have anticipated them .

		Sickles 's fight delayed Longstreet , and prevented an earlier attack on Little Round Top .

		In Chapter XL , on `` Lee and his Mistakes , '' the author attri - butes to
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	mistakes made by others .

		If General
Lee	PERSON	's plans had been carried out as ordered ,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	would probably have been a success for the Confederates .

Beecham	PERSON	concedes that ''

Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 Longstreet he fails to condemn his mistakes which prevented the fulfilment of
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	's plans .

		It is wrong to say that `` for once , at least ,
Lee	PERSON	's courage failed him . ''

		He had already declined to take Longstreet 's advice and flank the Federals out of their position .

		Surely this might have been done ; but having already begun to fight them out of it ,
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	preferred to continue on that line , believing that with proper support he could succeed in his object .

		The author praises General
Reynolds	PERSON	very highly , and doubtless deservedly ; but his career was soon cut short .

		The absence of the
Fifth and Sixth Corps	ORGANIZATION	made it all the more necessary that the battle of the second of
July	DATE	should begin as early as possible on the part of the Confederates , and every impartial reader knows that it was not begun as early as it might have been .

		It was not General
Lee	PERSON	who was hesitating , but
Longstreet	LOCATION	; and Captain
Beecham	PERSON	rightly says -LRB- page 158 -RRB- : `` Longstreet must have lost two precious hours in marching , counter-marching , and mano3uvring for position .

		The result was that the Fifth and
Sixth Corps	ORGANIZATION	were getting nearer and nearer , and finally had to be reckoned with .

		At last , late in the after - noon , Longstreet 's brigades were in readiness , '' and they gave a good account of themselves when they were ready .

		But supposing they had been ready even two or three hours sooner ; how different might have been the result of that battle !

		Had the Federal lines from Little Round Top been enfiladed , as they might have been , what would have been the result ?

		Had Han - cock 's Corps been repulsed , what an opening there would have been for
Ewell	PERSON	and Hill !

		The reviewer has often wondered why
Rodes 's Division	ORGANIZATION	, with which he later served , did so little on that day , and he can only explain it on the theory that the opposing lines were too strong to justify an attack .

		He knows some - thing of that division and its commander , and he knows that General
Rodes	PERSON	would not have hesitated to go wherever he conceived success to be possible .

		But
Longstreet	PERSON	did not open the way .

		He had already delayed too long , to make the attack on the increased numbers feas - ible .

		The engagement at the
Peach Orchard	LOCATION	allowed sufficient time for the Federal troops to get up , and prevented the enfilading move - ment and its consequences .

		The author says -LRB- page 187 -RRB- : `` Had Longstreet begun his battle two hours earlier , at two rather than at four o'clock , it would have been over be - fore
Sykes	PERSON	's arrival , and the Battle of
Gettys	PERSON	- burg would have been counted as the most ter - rible defeat of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause . ''

		That is the way it looks to the reviewer ; but he would sub - stitute Longstreet for Lee in the next sen - tences '' Lee 's unaccountable hesitation and unreadiness in the morning , '' etc. .

		The author says also -LRB- page 187 -RRB- : '' A further delay of half an hour , for any cause , and
Sykes	PERSON	would have found Little Round Top in Law 's possession , and
Cemetery Ridge	ORGANIZATION	occupied by Longstreet and his Confederates . ''

		There is no doubt of this ; the only question is as to who is respon - sible for the delay .

		Longstreet knew , the night before , that he had to make this attack the next morning , and he should have made due prepar - ation for it .

		But he expected General
Lee	PERSON	to adopt his strategy , and so failed to make due preparation , and instead of being ready in the morning he was not ready until four o'clock in the
afternoon	TIME	.

		This unreadiness should not be laid on
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	's shoulders .

		Time is an essential element in battle .

		Forrest 's great prin - ciple of strategy , to '' get there first with the most men , '' will tell every time ; and it told here .

		Succeeding chapters in
Captain Beecham	LOCATION	's book give an account of the fighting at
Cemetery Hill	ORGANIZATION	and
Gulp	ORGANIZATION	's Hill , fought by
Early	ORGANIZATION	's division and
Johnson	PERSON	's division ; but the Confederate success was only temporary .

		The attack was not sustained , and when the Federals came back next morning they readily recovered their entrenchments .

		The author wonders `` why
Ewell	PERSON	did not send the other three brigades of
Rodes	PERSON	's division , and especially
Gordon	PERSON	's brigade of Early 's , '' and thus make the attack more successful .

		Captain
Beecham	PERSON	is right in thinking there was no bluff about
Pickett	PERSON	's and
Pettigrew	PERSON	's charge , '' and no necessity for a bluff . ''

		It was simply an illustration of the homely adage about '' sending a small boy to mill , '' and it was not General
Lee	PERSON	's intention that so small a boy should be sent alone .

		Here again Longstreet comes in for a share of blame .

		McLaws and Hood should have helped
Pickett	PERSON	.

		With this addition to the assaulting column , the charge might have been successful .

		It may be a ques - tion as to whether this charge should ever have been attempted ; certainly , as made , it was fore - doomed to failure .

		It is also a question whether much was expected from
Stuart	PERSON	's cavalry on that day .

		The cavalry were `` played out / ' The author rightfully says -LRB- page 223 -RRB- : ''
Stuart	PERSON	was at a disadvantage ; his men were worn and weary from long and continuous riding ; his horses were jaded and spiritless , while
Gregg	PERSON	's and
Custer	PERSON	's men and horses were comparatively 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, fresh and vigorous , and ready for action . ''

		The author gives a chapter to '' the great cannonade . ''

		The reviewer may contribute his mite to the account by stating that when the cannonade was at its height he took out his watch and counted one hundred guns to the minute .

		General
Alexander	PERSON	, who was directing the Con - federate fire , stated that `` the enemy 's fire has not slackened at all . ''

		This makes it clear that the charge should not have been ordered ; it was simply sending men to their death .

		There was no reason to suppose '' that
Meade	PERSON	was out of ammunition . ''

		It may be mentioned , for future correction , that the author prints -LRB- after page 238 -RRB- a picture of Gen.
Robert S. Garnett	PERSON	, killed near
Carrick	PERSON	's
Ford	ORGANIZATION	on
Cheat River	LOCATION	,
West Virginia	LOCATION	,
July 12 , 1861	DATE	, for that of Gen.
Richard B. Garnett	PERSON	, killed at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	while commanding a bri - gade in
Pickett	LOCATION	's division .

		As far as known , no picture of Gen.
Richard B. Garnett	PERSON	exists .

		Captain
Beecham	PERSON	rightfully tries to correct the erroneous impression that
Pickett	PERSON	's column deserves '' credit for the whole affair . ''


Petti	PERSON	- grew 's troops , and some others , were also there , and should always be mentioned in any account of this famous charge .

		There is glory enough for all , in any correct account of it .

		General
Garnett	PERSON	, on account of illness , was one of the few officers in that charge who was mounted , and he was killed within about a hundred yards of the rock fence , and his body was never recovered .

		It is buried among '' the unknown dead '' on the field of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, a mute testi - mony to his gallantry , when too he would have been fully justified in not going into that charge on account of his physical condition , but he was unwilling to allow his men to go in without him .

		The author calls it ''
Pickett	PERSON	's mad charge , '' but his men could not hesitate to go where they were ordered .

		Live or die , they were bound to obey orders ; and notwithstanding the calamitous result of that fatal day , no one can deny that their duty was to obey .

		General
Meade	PERSON	has been criticized for not making a counter-charge ; but he was wise in not doing so .

		He preferred to '' let well enough alone . ''

		The Confederates were not routed , but they were repulsed .

		At the first sign of pur - suit they would have rallied on
Seminary Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, and the battle would have been on again .

		The author is not satisfied with the official state - ment of losses sustained by the Confederates , but contends that `` the Confederate losses in the aggregate exceeded the
Union	ORGANIZATION	losses by sev - eral thousand . ''

		This is a useless contention , and one that can never be settled .

		If we go outside of the official reports , there is no basis for argument ; and whatever goes beyond these is but an individual 's private opinion , and one man 's opinion is as good as another 's .

		Where
Meade	PERSON	failed was in not attacking near
Hagers	LOCATION	- town and
Williamsport	LOCATION	, where General
Lee	PERSON	's army was detained by high water ; and it was nearly out of ammunition .

		My own train , the
General Reserve Advance	ORGANIZATION	train , was entirely out , and its wagons were filled with arms collected from the battlefield of .

		the first day at
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg .

		High water prevented our re-crossing at
Williamsport	LOCATION	, and we had to wait there several days until the water subsided .

		Our handful of cavalry , teamsters , and stragglers , put up a good fight and repulsed the enemy .

		Captain Beecham comments freely on ''
Lee	PERSON	's blunders at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, '' but fails to prove his contention ; and as to '' prolonging the war , '' he loses sight of the brilliant campaign from the Rapidan to
Petersburg	LOCATION	, in which Grant was com - pletely outgeneralled , and did not '' fight it out on that line , '' although it took all
summer	DATE	and winter too , and but for Sherman another sum - mer would have been needed . ''

		Overwhelming numbers and resources '' triumphed at last .

		With some corrections and additions , this volume might be made an excellent account of the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	; but the author should give up his prejudices for Longstreet and his hostility to Lee , and view with impartiality the incidents of the battle .

		There was good fight - ing done on both sides on that field ; but when troops on each side are equal in prowess , or nearly so , numbers will tell , and these prepon - derated on the Federal side .

		Position , too , has something to do with the result of a battle , and this was decidedly in favor of the Federals .

		Lee did not intend to fight there , and the battle was brought on without his intention or his orders .

		His lieutenants did not sustain him with unanimity .

		It is said that he once remarked that if he had had
Jackson	PERSON	at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, he would have won .

		Many others believe the same thing .

		But whatever we may think of the result , it is a manifest duty to reconcile ourselves to it .

		THE DIAL 129 FRENCH INFLTJENCE ox ENGLISH tilTEBATUKE .

		* What Professor
Herford	PERSON	did for the literary relations of
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	in the six - teenth century , Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	has done for those of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	in the same period .

		During the age of the Renaissance , political and geographical confines did not a prison make for art and literature ; then , if ever , there were influences and counter-influences of school on school , of nation on nation .

		In a period of such vast intellectual activity and emotional fervor , it was impossible to hedge in the free spirit that demanded utterance in all tongues .

		Ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and modern
Italy	LOCATION	were the sources of this imperious inspiration that stirred all
Europe	LOCATION	; but as in all ages of great artistic quickening , creation and not mere imitation flowed from these sources .

		The national genius , whether Italian , French , or English , prevailed ; it made its own what it took from abroad .

		So it was that when French culture entered
England	LOCATION	it was assimilated by the native genius and became as truly English as that born of the soil .

		The extent of this influence was very great , so great that '' neither the classics , nor Italian art and literature , nor German art and literature , can on a broad sur - vey be said to equal it . ''

		To determine the character , and , within limits , the extent of this influence , forms the thesis of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's book on '' The French Renaissance in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The character of this influence covers nearly all provinces of the intellectual activity of the time .


France	LOCATION	absorbed the culture of
Greece	LOCATION	and modern
Italy	LOCATION	, and independently sought to keep in the van of progress .

		In this respect she was many years ahead of
England	LOCATION	, and was therefore fitted to be the medium of classical and Renaissance culture for
England	LOCATION	, as well as to be in a position to exert independent influ - ence .

		Moreover , the political links binding the two countries , their social relationships , and their geographical situation make the influ - ence of
France	LOCATION	upon
England	LOCATION	almost inevitable .

		There was something also in the French char - acter which appealed to the English .

		L' esprit gaulois , mainly because it is different , has always had an attraction for the stolid English - man , who can find nothing like it at home .

		It implies , says Mr.
Lee	PERSON	, '' three enviable qualities : firstly , flexibility of thought ; secondly , gaiety , tending at times to levity and coarseness , but * THE FRENCH RENAISSANCE IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		yielding to pathetic tenderness ; and , thirdly , a melodious ease of frank and simple utterance . ''

		It came about that in manners as well as in literature and art
France	LOCATION	was the chief refining agent in
Tudor	LOCATION	society .

		In the barren years from
1500	DATE	to
1550	DATE	, French influence was more in matters of exter - nals than in ideas .

		The language was studied in French grammars written by Englishmen ; English books were published in
France	LOCATION	; certain metrical forms , like the familiar Skeltonian verse , were imitated from the French .

		Print - ing was an honored profession in
France	LOCATION	at the beginning of the sixteenth century , when in
England	LOCATION	it was in the hands of `` half-educated foreign mechanics , '' the sole exception being
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the printing-press was one of the most powerful agents of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		ID the
second half of the century	DATE	this influence extended to the leading departments of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan literature , to prose , the lyric , and the drama , as well as t6 the religious and devotional writings inspired by the work of the Huguenots .

		The extent of the indebtedness of English to French culture is not so easily determined .

		It involves , as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	points out , a comparison of the voluminous literatures of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, to know which of the two latter it was that more directly affected the first .

		That the influence of
France	LOCATION	was greater than has been generally recognized is clear on an exami - nation of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's volume .

		Even
Wyatt	PERSON	and
Surrey	LOCATION	, who are generally thought of as going directly to
Italy	LOCATION	, absorbed rather from
France	LOCATION	the Italian `` taste and sympathy which were reflected in the manner and matter of their poetry '' ; and the direct agents were
Marot	PERSON	and the
Parisian Florentine Alamanni	ORGANIZATION	.

		In works of philosophy , theology , and biography , the French source is usually acknowledged ; corre - sponding to
Calvin	LOCATION	,
Amyot	ORGANIZATION	,
Rabelais	LOCATION	, and Montaigne , are
Hooker , North	ORGANIZATION	,
Nashe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bacon	PERSON	, not to mention others who reflected their influence to a lesser degree .

		In the lyric , on the other hand , there is rarely an acknowledge - ment of source , and it is therefore necessary to depend upon the deadly parallel study of indi - vidual poems .

		The poets desired credit for orig - inality , and they trusted to their appropriations not being discovered .

		The Pleiade , which had become a dominating force in French poetry , extended its sphere to
England	LOCATION	, so that the metrical forms , the vocabulary , and the matter of the French lyric , very considerably affected the English .

		Thus , we find Lyly 's '' lo Bacchus !

		To thy table '' inspired by an equally 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, buoyant lyric of
Ronsard	ORGANIZATION	's ; and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' glorified ebullition , '' '' Hark , hark !

		the lark at heaven 's gate sings , '' has the atmosphere of French rather than of English poetry .

		One might remark here , in criticism , that it is ex - tremely difficult to dogmatize about such intangi - ble stuff as the Shakespearean lyric , to separate what is the fine essence of the author 's pure imagination from what is the characteristic pro- duct of a school or nation .

		It is easier to trace the antecedents of the Elizabethan sonnet .

		French influence is sometimes apparent in literal translation , sometimes in imitative para - phrase .

		The familiar topics of the Shake - spearean sonnet as the fading of youthful beauty and the consequent need of self - propagation , the denunciation of a false mis - tress of black complexion , and the like were a '' constant burden of the sonnet of the French Renaissance . ''

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	here merely hints at his own skepticism concerning the autobio - graphical value of the sonnets of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, by remarking that those who hold to this view '' can hardly deny that
Shakespeare	PERSON	at times took his cue from contemporary French liter - ature . ''

		Similarly , the poetic vaunt of immor - tality , which in some cases has , in other cases has not , been justified , goes back to
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Horace	PERSON	, and
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, through the poets of the Pleiade .

		The influence of the Huguenots was not so marked in literary as in social matters .

		The religious poetry of the last years of
Elizabeth	PERSON	and the early days of James is largely inspired , however , by the Huguenot Du Bartas 's Le Semaine , which had been badly translated by Sylvester , and notwithstanding its uncouth English dress exerted a very considerable influ - ence , most markedly in the work of
Drayton and Donne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , the so-called metaphysi - cal school , which is generally carried back to
Donne	PERSON	with his '' combination of dissimilar images or discovery of occult resemblances in things apparently unlike , '' may be carried back still further , says Mr.
Lee	PERSON	, to the work of this
Frenchman Du Bartas	ORGANIZATION	.

		The French influence was thus not always an unmixed blessing .

		In the drama , the influence of
France	LOCATION	was in the furnishing of plot material , and toward a more exact following of classical traditions .

		French history , as in the story of the Guises , and French versions of Italian novels and plays , furnished the theme for many an English play .

		There was always a learned party in
England	LOCATION	advocating a closer adherence to the orthodox classical creed ; but the vigorous drama of En - gland preferred the ways of romance to those of academic classicism .

		Here was the parting of the ways , since
France	LOCATION	chose the classical , and failed to reach the consummate glory of the Shakespearean performance .

		Beyond a certain point , French influence was unavailing ; for there in the empyrean the individual genius soared alone .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	gives all due credit to his predeces - sors in the field , especially to Jusserand and
Upham	LOCATION	; but none has treated the subject in this period so exhaustively as he , while at the same time he makes it quite clear that his work is not definitive .

		If one might urge a criti - cism , it is the one usually attendant upon a tracing of sources and influences , that the seeker is apt to find what he is looking for , and not to give sufficient weight to what is either uni - versal or individual .

		Into such error , though , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	does not often slip .

		* Of recent books published in or about

		THE DIAL 131 the All Red Route , and the question of national defence .

		There are a number of appropriate illustrations , including such up-to-date subjects as a view of Main Street in
Prince Rupert	LOCATION	, and a picture of the consolidated School Garden Plots at the
Guelph Agricultural College	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the more important of the books in our present group is the last publication of the
Champlain Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a reprint of a very old and rare work , by Father Le Clercq , a Recol - lect missionary in
New France	LOCATION	, who labored for many years among the Indians of the
Gaspe	LOCATION	pen - insula .

		His book , published originally at
Paris	LOCATION	in
1691	DATE	, is now only to be found in the large reference libraries , and is therefore practically unknown to all except a few students .

		As one of the original narratives of the seventeenth century in
Canada	LOCATION	, it was well worth translating and reprinting ; and although its purely histor - ical value may be inferior to other works of the same period , it stands almost alone in the minuteness and fidelity of the account it gives of the manners and customs of the Gaspesian Indians .

		Father Le Clercq describes the origin of the Gaspesians , according to their own tradi - tions and the speculations of European travel - lers , their birth , customs , dress , ornaments , wig - wams , and home life , fo'od , language , religion , etc. .

		He also devotes a chapter to the description of a system of hieroglyphic characters which he invented for the use of his converts .

		Another long chapter contains a very entertaining nar - rative of his mid-winter voyage along the coast from
Nepisiguit	LOCATION	to
Miramichi	LOCATION	.

		Father Le Clercq tells us , among other things , that the Gaspesians worshipped the Cross before the ad - vent of white men .

		He gives a curious native tradition to the effect that in a certain time of great national calamity some of their wisest old men saw in a dream a beautiful stranger who showed them a Cross and told them that if the nation would make the like , and hold it in respect , it would bring an end of all their ills .

		The missionary tells us that in his first voyage to
Gaspesia	LOCATION	he found a Cross embellished with beads set in the place of honor in a wigwam , and the owner told him that he had received it from his ancestors by inheritance .

		Professor
Ganong	PERSON	, in his invaluable Introduction to the reprint of Le Clercq 's work , discusses minutely the contemporary and other evidence for and against Le
Clercq	ORGANIZATION	's story of the origin of the worship of the Cross ; and after rejecting the theories of Lafitau ,
Charlevoix	LOCATION	, and others , that Le Clercq was carried away by his own enthusi - asm and that there was no real basis for his story , conies to the conclusion that
Le Clercq	PERSON	did find the Cross among the
Miramichi Indians	LOCATION	, but that it was probably a totem sign which , drawn in outline and more or less conventional - ized according to custom , fell somewhat into the form of a cross .

		In addition to his scholarly Introduction , Professor
Ganong	PERSON	has enriched this reprint with a number of valuable notes .

		The volume contains an exact copy of the orig - inal , as well as a translation ; also a biblio - graphical description of the original work by
Victor Hugo Paltsits	PERSON	, and a full index .

		Mr.
Frank Yeigh	PERSON	, author of '' Through the Heart of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' assumed a difficult task in attempting to describe the
Dominion of Canada	ORGANIZATION	from a fresh view-point .

		So many more or less competent writers have covered the same field , in much the same way , during the last few years , that the average reader will be inclined to reject this book as a mere re-statement of what others had said before .

		Mr.
Yeigh	PERSON	has , however , his own individual way of looking at things ; he also offers us the contrast of a Canadian describing his own country other recent writers in the same field having been English , French , or American ; and , further , he includes in his book an account of several little-known districts , such as
New Ontario	LOCATION	, the
Magdalen Islands	ORGANIZATION	, and the Cariboo country of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		He also gives us an excel - lent account of that splendidly efficient little force , the
North West Mounted Police	LOCATION	; and one is glad of the opportunity of quoting this simple tribute from the official head of the force : '' Whether bringing relief to isolated settlers in bitter cold and over the deep snow of the open plains , carrying mail to distant
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	posts , to the Arctic seas , or to detachments in
Northern British Columbia	LOCATION	, or hurry - ing to the relief of unfortunate persons in remote parts , our men never fail us .

		They undertake the work with cheerfulness and carry it out indifferent to difficulties and hardships . ''

		The dangers of the service were sufficiently revealed a few months ago , in the discovery of the bodies of a detachment of the Police , who had been sent out from
Dawson	PERSON	in the
winter of 1910	DATE	, carrying mail to
Fort Macpherson	LOCATION	,
Mackenzie River	LOCATION	.

		They had starved to death within a few miles of their destination .

		Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	is one of those English sportsmen who wander about the earth in search of new fields and new laurels .

		His book describes a three-months ' fishing expedition in
Eastern Canada	LOCATION	, including salmon fishing on the Mira - michi , '' muskallonge '' and black bass in
Georgian Bay	LOCATION	, and tuna off the
Cape Breton Coast	LOCATION	.

		The description of the attempts of him - 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, self and others to land these monsters of the sea , the tuna , makes perhaps the most interest - ing reading in the book .

		The mere idea of angling for a fish that runs anywhere up to eight hundred or nine hundred pounds , rather takes away the breath of anyone not accustomed to big game fishing .

		The following extract from Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	's diary will persuade most of us to leave the tuna severely alone : '' About 10.15 we caught sight of
Ross	PERSON	in tow of a fish which was taking him at a terrific pace across the bay .

		I afterwards learned that he had hooked it at 9.55 , and he played it in all for seven hours , thirty-five minutes .

		It seems a brief fight compared with that of nineteen hours
last year	DATE	, but this was far more effective than that , which was mostly towage .

		I watched him , keeping well out of the way , for five hours , during which time he was twice taken half way to the
Bird Islands	ORGANIZATION	, the yacht standing by all the time , and the little power launch taking supplies for him and his men .

		He must have covered twenty or thirty miles in all .

		Then it seemed about three-thirty his rod broke over the gunwale , aud he held the tuna for the last two hours on the broken stump .

		At the end he had worked his fish to a beach , and was handling it for the gaff , but the line caught for an instant on the jagged edge of the broken tip a * hd parted .

		Seeing that
Ross	PERSON	had two men to row his boat , a yacht standing by throughout , and a power boat plying between the two , the difficulties for any sportsman more normally fitted out look almost insuperable . ''

		And that ought to be a comfort to any reckless sportsman who has dreamed of landing a
North Atlantic	LOCATION	tuna !

		the arguments in behalf of the traditional views recently advanced by
Sanday	PERSON	,
Stanton	PERSON	, and
Drummond	PERSON	.

		He points out , as others have done , that
Drummond	PERSON	saves the authenticity of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	at the expense of the writ - er 's accuracy ; while
Sanday	PERSON	admits so large an idealizing tendency , especially in the long ad - dresses attributed to Jesus , that the evangelist 's testimony is seriously weakened .

		Professor
Bacon	PERSON	clearly shows that the voluminous ma - terial gathered , over a generation ago , by Light - foot and
Ezra Abbot	PERSON	, actually has little or no bearing on the real question at issue .

		He points out that evidence that the
Gospel	ORGANIZATION	existed during the years 120-150 is not proof that those who knew and used it then regarded it as apostolic ; while similarities in phrase and thought in the writings of that period do not necessarily prove dependence upon this Gospel .

		Such similarities undoubtedly root back in conditions anterior to both the Gospel and to these expositions of what was then rising as a comparatively new form of Christian Faith .

		Professor
Bacon	PERSON	brings out with much force and clearness the important facts , the signifi - cant bearings of which have not generally been sufficiently recognized , that the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	for many years was not accepted as apostolic by important sections of
Christendom	LOCATION	; that it only slowly won its way to general acceptance ; and that its final inclusion in the canon was due , not to historical evidence or to the char - acter of the writing itself , but to theological prepossessions .

		The type of thought which it represented finally became dominant and craved apostolic sanction .

		The age was speculative , but not critical .

		It gladly appropriated what nourished its new forms of piety .

		But the
Synoptics	ORGANIZATION	long remained supreme as sources of the life-story and ethical message of Jesus , even with those who for doctrinal reasons came to use the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	as authoritative .

		The writ - ings of the church fathers of the
last half of the second century	DATE	plainly illustrate this fact .

		This treatise on the so-called Gospel of
John	ORGANIZATION	is as popular in character as the discussion of such a problem admits .

		What eminent scholars have contributed to its solution during recent years is briefly but clearly described .

		Profes - sor
Bacon	PERSON	does not accept
Wendt	PERSON	's suggestive partition theory , but presents instead the view that the Gospel was produced primarily as a doctrinal exposition , which early received edi - torial revision ; so that in the work as it lies before us we have the writing of a mystical expositor who used the
Synoptics	ORGANIZATION	and other
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 133 materials -LRB- possibly some may have come from the apostle John -RRB- to set forth the Logos con - ception of Jesus , which was then coming into prominence , working as honestly as
Paul	PERSON	and in much the same spirit .

		Afterwards this writ - ing was somewhat worked over or edited by a redactor possibly more than one .

		By such a theory as this , the numerous dislocations , abrupt transitions , and incongruities of the document , long ignored or slighted by conserv - ative scholars , are easily explained .

		Professor
Bacon	PERSON	frankly admits , in his closing pages , that this general conclusion of modern Biblical scholarship respecting the Fourth Gos - pel must necessarily produce marked changes in the theology , the preaching , and the ideals of the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		But he contends and in this he is manifestly right that all such necessary and permanent changes in faith and teaching will be for the good of Christianity and the blessing of mankind .

		WHAT is ART ?

		* Nothing puzzles the ordinary man more , when he thinks about the matter at all , than the difference between his notions and feelings about art and those of artists and connoisseurs .

		Though art may interest him little or not at all , he is nevertheless quite sure he knows what it is : his mind is not perplexed by definitions or shades of meaning .

		Why , then , should there be wide divergence of opinion about it among those for whom art forms the larger part of daily life ?

		The lack of an authoritative and comprehensive definition does not explain this ; most people are content to get along without * WHAT is ART ?

		such an aid to clarity of thought .

		The answer is that artists are not philosophers ; their work is synthetic , not analytic , and rarely does their education tend to give them a clearly visioned and consistent conception of the nature of art , though if it did their average level of perform - ance would almost certainly be much higher than it is .

		The philosophers too , for the most part , have failed to take a comprehending view , being less concerned to understand art than to elaborate formulas respecting it which shall square with their general hypotheses about life .

		Art occupies a much larger place in the world than is generally realized .

		The ways in which it enters into and modifies the appearance of the things that surround us are countless .

		The im - portance , therefore , of right thinking in regard to it is very great .

		To such thinking , Profes - sor Van Dyke 's little book offers valuable aid .

		In answering the question '' What is Art ? ''

		he does not attempt a definition , but puts the true point of view before the reader in delightfully incisive and luminous phrase , demonstrating beyond cavil that '' art is primarily a matter of doing , somewhat a matter of seeing and feeling , and perhaps not at all a matter of theme or thinking . ''

		Trite as this may sound , it is doc - trine that can not be inculcated too often ; as Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	says , it has to be impressed anew upon every succeeding generation .

		The book consists of six essays , all but one of which may be commended without reserva - tion .

		The exception is the essay on '' Quality in Art , '' in which an attempt is made to explain the use of the word '' quality '' to denote what the French with nicer discrimination speak of as charactere .

		Like many other slip-shod ex - pressions , it has gained some currency .

		That so careful a writer as Professor Van Dyke should accept it , is surprising .

		Quality is not the same thing as distinctive character .

		To impress the word with that meaning is indefen - sible , and must inevitably lead to confusion of thought .

		An example is furnished by the essay under consideration , where the word frequently recurs , but is not always used in the same sense .

		In the essay on '' The Use of the Model '' the author points out one of the chief causes of the weakness of the art of to-day .

		The world 's masterpieces were largely done '' out of the heads '' of the men who produced them .

		They recognized the danger of slavish adherence to the model and the importance of training the visual memory .

		Our artists and the teachers in our art schools would do well to ponder long and carefully what Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	has to 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, say upon this topic .

		Turning to the considera - tion of art criticism and art history , he justly finds fault with the application of '' the dollar standard '' in judging works of art , and condemns the attitude of many collectors and connoisseurs .

		Eminently sound also are his remarks about the fragile character of so-called art history , built , as it sometimes is , upon a foundation of surmise .

		The essay on `` Art Appreciation '' is a plea for the development of a distinctively American art .

		This is vigorously pressed , and there is undoubted force in the author 's contention .

		But while it is obvious that '' we shall not be great in art or its appreciation , nor shall we in anywise become an artistic people , until we put aside our foreign baubles and do our own things with our own materials in our own way , '' the argument against the acquisition of works of art that happen to be old or made in other lands is hardly convincing .

		It entirely ignores their educational value , which in the long run should help , not hinder , our appreciation of the produc - tions of American workers in the field of art .

		In '' Art 's Enigma , '' Mr.
Frederick Jameson	PERSON	makes another attempt to bring order out of the '' absolute chaos of our ideas upon the subject . ''

		It is a serious and careful study , embracing the whole field of art , with the aim `` to discover some of the essential characteristics of the differ - ent things it unites in one . ''

		The author begins by showing the fallacy of many widely held notions .

		A person is not necessarily an artist because he happens to practise one of the arts .

		A painter does not actually copy the landscape in front of him , though he often entertains the delusion that he does .

		Realism and idealism are meaningless phrases .

		Realism signifies merely `` a presentation of nature in accord with the view of the ordinary unimaginative person . ''

		Idealism signifies the presentation of equally real but less familiar things . ''

		Bad art can only mean inartistic art , which is a contradiction in terms . ''

		A vital note is sounded in this cogent utterance : '' All artistic < impressions ' ... must be conceived , so to speak , in the medium of their expression , and not translated into it .

		The thing in the painter 's mind must be a painted picture , uot an intellectual conception ; he must think in paint , forms , and colours ; the musician must think in sound ; the dramatist must hear and see his characters on the stage as he composes . ''

		This leads up to analyses of the several arts of music , poetry , the drama , novel - writing , paint - ing , and architecture , for the purpose of reveal - ing the qualities common to all , on the theory that '' widely as the material and methods of the various arts differ , their essence and aim must be the same . ''

		Taking a harmonized tune one of the simplest works of art known to us as the type , his analysis yields the following '' schedule of the constituents of an art work '' : '' A work of art is the representation of an imagina - tive conception of a group of things composed together in such a manner as to produce a number of esthetic and emotional impressions , not all pleasant in themselves , but combining into one whole intensely delightful , com - plex , but harmonious mental impression .

		Its essence and the source of its charm and of all the effects above quoted emotional suggestion , change of painful impres - sions to pleasant ones , unity and perfection of the whole lie in the form and relation of the parts , and not at all in the separate component elements The work ap - peals to the imagination alone , and the reason , or con - sciously acting part of the intellect , is insensible to its appeal , and is unable to explain or in any way to account for its attraction or even to tell whether any group of things form a work of art or not .

		Its sole aim , so far as we can at present see , is a certain kind of pleasure , of which the source is a highly complex kind of beauty . ''

		As a working definition , this fails to satisfy .

		Surely the nature of the emotional or the mental impression produced can not be one of the con - stituents of a work of art , since it depends upon the sensitiveness of the observer 's mind , and not upon the quality or character of the thing observed .

		The ordinary man , also , will find it difficult to realize that his reason counts for noth - ing in the perception of harmonic relation .

		When a perfect definition is put together , it will lay much stress upon the creative element as a prime essential .

		In a way , Mr.
Jameson	PERSON	perceives this ; and he insists that the creative emotion depends on its universality and not on its personality , and must cease to be absorb - ingly personal before it can find poetic expres - sion .

		His words in this connection are worth bearing in mind . ''

		Many works have been ruined as art by the attempt to bring into them some present personal experience or some burning personal emotion .

		Nevertheless , the desire that prompts such attempts is continually spoken of as the impelling force which produces art , and is confounded with the true ardour of the artist , which springs from the need of expressing , not his spirit 's experience , but his imagination 's vision . ''

		Mr.
Jameson	PERSON	's comments upon the arts of musi - cal and dramatic composition , and of the writ - ing of poetry and novels , are of special interest from the rigorous logic with which he pushes his inquiry , and the clearness with , which he perceives that musical compositions , dramas , novels , and poems , as well as pictures , can only be classed as works of art when their compo - nent materials have been welded into organic and rhythmic unity .

		He has handled a difficult subject with lucidity and insight .

Russell Barrington	PERSON	's `` Essays on the Purpose of Art '' are marred by extreme diffu -

		THE DIAL 135 siveness and constant digression which make her book a difficult one to read .

		It is designed as a sort of supplement or , as the author puts it '' a sequel '' to her '' Reminisences of
G. F. Watts	PERSON	'' and '' The Life , Letters and Work of
Frederic Leigh	PERSON	ton '' ; and two of the essays attempt to describe the '' something '' said by these artists which '' nothing has said before . ''

		In the case of
Leighton	LOCATION	, this '' something '' is declared to be : `` First , the power of treating form with absolute structural correctness and at the same time with singu - lar grace ; masculine force and feminine quality of line combined ; and secondly , to depict sentiment and meaning through attitudes of the human figure . ''

		Need we wonder , therefore , that his art was not '' art for art 's sake , '' but '' art for nature 's sake '' ?

		Far different was the '' something '' said by
Watts	ORGANIZATION	.

		His work '' embodied the sense of noble Greek serenity emotionalized into pas - sion by the temperament of the Celt . ''

		In a general way , the author realizes that the pur - pose of art is the satisfaction of the aesthetic sense ; but her conception of art is extremely hazy , though much that she says is sound and well expressed .

		The six
Scammon Lectures	ORGANIZATION	delivered before the
Art Institute of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Will H. Low	PERSON	, and now gathered in a volume entitled '' A Painter 's Progress , '' are pleasantly remi - niscent , and deal with the author 's student life and later experiences during thirty long years at home and abroad .

		They describe , with much interesting detail , the conditions under which the young American artist of fifty years ago prepared for his life-work .

		These conditions belong to a day that is past .

		Technical profi - ciency can now be acquired as well in the art schools of our larger cities as in
Paris	LOCATION	or
Munich	LOCATION	.

		But the gain in facilities for the education of our artists has not been accom - panied by a corresponding increase in public appreciation of art .

		Mr. Low feels sure that in
New York	LOCATION	at least , in the seventies , the number of those who took a well-defined inter - est in art '' included a greater share of the gen - eral public than to-day . ''

		That was before a new art propaganda , bristling with fads and Academic inanities , had been established here by enthusiastic young painters and architects fresh from European studios , and what Profes - sor Van Dyke speaks of as '' the unloading at our doors of the art plunder of all creation '' had begun .

		The awakening of a new and more intelligent interest , Mr. Low thinks , can best be stimulated through the wider employment of fine mural decoration .

		How this can be brought about is perhaps not apparent .

		Mr.
Low	PERSON	is sure that '' the world is more filled with think - ing men and women to-day than it was in the most brilliant epochs of the old days of art , and they will listen only ' the artist ' must have something to say . ''

		More than that , however , is necessary .

		The important thing is that what the artist has to say should be uttered in such a way as to command attention .

		Oliver Hobbes '' -LRB- Mrs.
Pearl Mary	PERSON	-
Teresa Craigie	PERSON	-RRB- brought sorrow to her thousands of readers and admirers .

		Of novels and plays from her hand we shall have no more ; but in the volume of her letters now published we find something of a more personal and intimate character , the unstudied expression of the mind and heart of both
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	and Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Life of
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	, Told in her Correspondence with Numerous Friends '' -LRB- Button -RRB- opens with fifty - four pages of biography from the pen of her father , Mr.
John Morgan Richards	PERSON	, prefaced by a brief introduction by
Bishop Welldon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's American birth and parentage are easily lost sight of , from the fact of her family 's early removal to
London	LOCATION	; but she remained to the end proud of hav - ing been born under the stars and stripes .

		Married at nineteen and soon separated from her husband , she shaped the fifteen years of her literary activity very much after her own desire , leaving upon one the impression of a strong and intensely vital per - sonality .

		Concerning her choice of her decidedly masculine nom de plume , she herself once said : '' I chose the name of
John	PERSON	because it is my father 's and my son 's ; Oliver because of the warring
Cromwell	PERSON	; and Hobbes because it is homely . ''

		Her love of the strong and pronounced in literature shows itself in an enthusiastic letter to Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, of whose `` Jude '' she does not hesitate to say : '' That ranks in my mind with
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's ` Last Judgment . '

		Its greatness goes beyond literature and challenges comparison with all works of amazing genius . ''

		From one of her knowledge and skill in music , the following on
Wagner	PERSON	as rendered at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	is surprising : '' I think the thing is , on the whole , mere sensa - tionalism of a rather vicious kind .

		In less than ten years
Wagner	PERSON	will be ' off . ' ''

		Her eager striving to excel in her art , especially as a dramatist , undoubt - edly shortened her strenuously busy life .

		The 136 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Portraits and other illustrations are not lacking .

		A European automobile tour , well * of the beaten track , and filled with much in the way of unusual and at times hair-raising experience , is described in detail and illustrated with innumerable snap-shot views , in Mr.
Roy Trevor	PERSON	's substantial volume entitled `` My Balkan Tour : An Account of Some Journeyings and Adventures in the
Near East	LOCATION	, together with a Descriptive and Historical Account of
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	,
Dalmatia	LOCATION	,
Croatia	LOCATION	, and the Kingdom of
Montenegro	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		The party was composed of veteran travellers , the author and an old school - friend , their wives , and one servant , and the inevitable hardships of the journey , through lands primitively ignorant of the motor-car as well as of many other things occidental , were borne with merry hearts and in a fine spirit of adventure .

		The five hundred pages of the book cover an ample range of history and description , all of it interesting to some readers , and some of it interesting to all read - ers .

		The amazement and even terror with which the sputtering vehicle of the strangers filled the natives and their domestic animals , especially the horses , were such as almost to pass belief in the telling .

		Here is a sample of the sights of the '' near East '' : ''
Skutari	PERSON	is a delight to the hunter of the bizarre , but a nightmare to the lover of hygiene , presenting as it does one vast , ever-changing pano - rama of almost grotesque characters .

		Its Turkish population is perhaps the most atrociously dirty on the face of the globe , yet if one does not probe too deeply into their lives , but is content to enjoy the general effect from a distance , one may delight in sights that belie the very word of
Europe	LOCATION	as we understand the term . ''

		The author has certainly given his readers good measure , and the lively inter - est he himself takes in every mile and every incident of the tour is sure to prove contagious with those who turn his pages .

		To the jaded tourist he renders a service by calling attention to fresh fields and untravelled roads of undeniable picturesqueness and charm .

		acterj fa s phil oso phy o f life , his mes - sage to mankind , and so on , have been duly dwelt upon by his many admirers and interpreters ; but his command of comedy as a medium for the convey - ance of his meaning has received far less attention , probably because , in the common acceptation of the term , comedy , mirth-compelling and more or less noisy , by no means abounds in his pages .

		But Mr.
Joseph Warren Beach	PERSON	's study of '' The Comic Spirit in George Meredith '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- serves as a not superfluous reminder that the creator of '' Sir Austin Feverel '' had in abundance that `` lean humor '' which the writer regards as the essence of comedy , or at least of the refined Meredithian variety of comedy .

		`` Meredith 's comedy , '' to quote Mr.
Beach	PERSON	's explanation in full , '' is lean humor .

		It is humor divested of those appurtenances of the sensu - ous , of sentimentality , of naturalistic detail , of material accident , of waggish impertinent wit , that make so fat and succulent the work of most English humorists . ''

		This high comedy of Meredith 's con - cerns itself with high life .

		It is not content with the obviously laughable , but '' deals with persons not comic on the surface , and shows them to be comic by the exhibition of their inner life . ''

		Accept - ing the author 's definition of comedy and the comic for the purposes of the present study , one finds in the succeeding chapters -LRB- on the wiseacre , the snob , the sentimentalist , the optimist , the egotist , and the romantic epicure -RRB- some keen and enjoyable inter - pretations of Meredithian characters and
Meredith	PERSON	- ian wit and wisdom .

		With the exception of certain desultory articles and chapters from earlier pens , Mr.
Beach	PERSON	's book is a pioneer in the critical discus - sion of the Meredithian comic spirit .

		In style , and in the evidences of careful study , it prepossesses one at first glance and invites to a more than cur - sory perusal .

		The Public Life of
Joseph Dudley	PERSON	'' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , by Professor
Everett Kimball	PERSON	, is primarily '' a study of the colonial policy of the Stuarts in
New England	LOCATION	, 1660-1715 , '' though extending by more than a quarter of a century beyond the period of Stuart rule in
England	LOCATION	.

		Dudley was a born politician and office-seeker , and contrived to keep himself rather prominently before the public during most of his adult life , holding a succession of offices and using his influence to secure desirable posts for his son and son-in-law .

		A `` singularly unlovely '' character , his present biographer confesses him to have been ; but the historian 's concern is not now with
Dudley	PERSON	the man , but with ''
Dudley	PERSON	as an English official charged vith the execution of the English policy . ''

		The animus of our older chroni - clers of American history is absent , undoubtedly with some loss of piquancy , from Professor
Kim	PERSON	- ball 's dispassionate and scholarly treatment of
Dudley	ORGANIZATION	's official activities .

		The available printed and manuscript sources of information , which are considerable in number , seem to have been thor - oughly examined , and the result is highly credit - able to the

		A dip into the future of Mr.
Charles Ferguson	PERSON	's convention - defying volume entitled `` The Uni - versity Militant '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- is a plea for making higher education more productive of good to humanity at large .

		The university should remodel itself on the twelfth-century pattern of '' a self-governing commonwealth '' in which `` the stu - dents had the suffrage and managed the corpora - tion ; the professors did not speak de haut en bas like princes and bishops . ''

		The author 's suggestion , therefore , is '' to build university towns , universities whose charters shall be municipal charters , and set them the task of subduing as much of the earth as they can manage say a million or two acres each , something over forty miles square by the exercise of their own organic civilizing powers . ''

		Science and the will to do good are to be brought into closer union .

		Arbitrariness intellectual , political , or of whatever sort is to give way to a sweet reason - ableness .

		At present ''

		It attempts to erect in this fluent , growing world a permanent establish - ment aloof from nature . ''

		The author speaks of `` the paralysis of ideal politics , '' and refers to '' scholars in politics '' as having '' had their day . ''

		Mr.
Ferguson	PERSON	's varied attainments he is a member of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , was at one time rector of

		The Rev.
Mason Locke Weems	PERSON	, whose '' Life of

		Melan - choly and humiliating is the picture presented of the harsh and often obviously illegal discrimination that the colored person of cosmopolitan
New York	LOCATION	struggles against , most often in vain , in the attempt to win a livelihood and to secure some modest measure of happiness and comfort and self-respect .

		Provincial , not cosmopolitan , is our metropolis in some of her prejudices as compared with
Paris	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, where other alien races besides the African have had occasion to note with gratitude the human - ity shown to them at a time when American rude - ness had left them tingling with humiliation and indignation .

		And from
Miss Ovington	LOCATION	's showing the conditions are not at present improving .

		`` Northern men visiting southern colored schools advise the pupils to remain where they are , and restless spirits among the race are assured that it is better to sub - mit to some personal oppression than to go to a land of uncertain employment .

		The past glory of the North is dwelt upon , its days of black waiters , and barbers , and coachmen ; but the present is painted in harsh colors . ''

		Nevertheless Miss Ovington cheers herself with the hope that '' in the future it -LSB-

Scott Nearing	PERSON	's little book en - its causes titled '' The Solution of the Child - and its cure .

Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written from the conviction that hitherto we have not been dealing adequately with the child - labor problem because we have been attacking child - labor itself directly through coercive legislation .

		We have not been concerned with a removal of its causes .

		Legislation against child-labor is not sufficient , be - cause child-labor is a symptom only .

		It is the pov - erty of wage-earners and inadequate schools that must be attacked , for these are the prime causes of child-labor .

		The steps necessary to the removal of these causes are , first , insuring proper training of children for life and work ; second , giving to society efficient and social men and women ; third , keeping families above the line of mal-nutrition ; and , fourth , preventing the premature employment of children .

		The writer recommends for the first and second 138 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The book is written in a popular vein , and gives somewhat the impression of expressing rather obvious views as if they were new and almost revolutionary .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are republishing some of the world 's greatest fictions in a new illustrated popular-priced form , '' The Louxembourg Library . ''

		They have just issued in this series
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Westward Ho ! ''

		and a translation of Tolstoy 's '' Resurrection '' by
Celine P. Delano	PERSON	.

		Each volume has a photogravure portrait of the author on the title-page .

		``
George Meredith	PERSON	: His Life and Art in Anecdote and Criticism , '' by Mr.
J. A. Hammerton	PERSON	, which was first issued within a few months of the novelist 's death , is now reissued by Mr.
John Grant	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in a revised and enlarged form with fifty-five illustrations .

		The book deals with every phase of Meredith 's life and art , and the author has amended its pages in places where the advisability of so doing was suggested by the criticisms of the first edition .

		Miss
Susan Faxon	PERSON	has written '' Two Latin Plays for High-School Students , '' which are published in a little volume by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their subjects are A Roman School '' and '' A Roman Wedding . ''

		It seems that the Roman schoolboy was given to reciting Macaronic verse , such as : ''
Jacobus Homer Sedebat	PERSON	in corner Eiiens Saturnalicinm pie . ''

		Directions are given for stage-setting and costuming .

		We heartily recommend this little book as a means of imparting freshness and interest to the dry work of teaching elementary Latin .

		It was more than a quarter of a century ago that Mr.
Slason Thompson	PERSON	collected from his scrap-books a vol - ume which he called '' The Humbler Poets . ''

		Since that time , Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	and Miss
Frances Rice	PERSON	have been making similar gleanings from current verse , and the result is a second volume bearing the above title .

		There are many kinds of '' humble poets , '' and the editors have kept tab upon most of them , besides a few who are probably a little indignant at finding them - selves thus designated .

		But it is stoutly denied that the term '' carries with it any pejorative signification , '' which disclaimer should console the aggrieved .

		Both volumes are published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Five new volumes appear in the ''
Home University Library '' of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The elementary .

Patrick Geddes	PERSON	and
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	, who are used to working in double harness .

		The Animal World '' is a correlated volume by Professor
F. W. Gamble	PERSON	, with an introduction by
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	, in '' The Science of Wealth , '' provides the uninformed with a few notions of elementary economics , tinctured with the socialistic spirit that is just now the fashion in books of this sort .

		A history of `` Mediaeval Europe '' the work of Mr.
H. W. C. Davis	PERSON	.

		In '' An Introduc - n to Mathematics , '' Mr.
A. N. Whitehead	PERSON	gives us a book intended to `` enable students from the very begin - ning of their course to know what the science is about and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena . ''

		This is a most praiseworthy object , and mathematical teaching would become much more interesting than it is if it were accompanied by a certain amount of reading of this philosophical , or of the historical sort .

		Shakespearian Scholarship has by no means come to a standstill .

		We are told in the `` Introduction to Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , produced by the joint labors of Drs.
MacCracken	PERSON	,
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	, and
Durham	LOCATION	, that `` the studies of
Wallace	PERSON	in the life-records , of
Lounsbury	PERSON	in the history of editions , of
Pollard	ORGANIZATION	and
Grey	PERSON	in early quartos , of Lee upon the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, of
Albright	PERSON	and others upon the Elizabethan Theatre , as well as valuable monographs on individual plays , '' have all been pro- duced since the publication of the last Shakespeare manual .

		The new work is thus amply justified .

		The closing lines of the book neatly characterize the Baconian delusion as '' one of the strangest medleys of garbled facts and fallacious reasoning which has ever imposed on an honest and intelligent but uninformed public . ''

		NOTES .

		The `` Kilmarnock ''
Burns	PERSON	of
1786	DATE	is added by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	to his delightful series of first editions in type-facsimile reprints .

		It is one of the most wel - come and attractive of the whole series .

		Professor
Edward A. Ross	PERSON	, of the
University of Wis	ORGANIZATION	- consin , has just completed a first-hand investigation of social and economic conditions in
China	LOCATION	, the results of which , in popular form , will be published immediately by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Ida M. Tarbell	PERSON	's important study of `` The Tariff in Our Times '' is to be issued at an early date by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this connection , we may note that practically all of Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's earlier books have been taken over by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A volume of '' Selections from Ancient Irish Poetry , '' translated by Dr.
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	, comes to us from the Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		It illustrates the various styles and moods of old Celtic literature myth , religion , songs of nature and love , and miscellaneous categories . ''

		Selections from
Byron	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
Samuel M. Tucker	PERSON	, and '' Selections from Lincoln , '' edited by Miss
Ida M. Tarbell	PERSON	, are additions to the '' Standard English Classics '' of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both books have readable introductions , and neither is overloaded with notes .

		For over thirty years ''
Corea	LOCATION	, The
Hermit Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
William E. Griffis	PERSON	, has been the standard author - ity on '' The Hermit Kingdom . ''

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons now announce a ninth edition of the work , in which six new chapters are devoted to the economics and politics of
Corea	LOCATION	, the war with
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, the Japanese protectorate , and on
Corea	ORGANIZATION	in its new status as a prov - ince of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		American novels that are just now taking the British fancy are the much talked-about '' Queed '' of Mr.
Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	, '' The Long Roll '' by Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	, and Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's '' Members of the Family . ''

		The last-named writer has become an estab - lished favorite with English readers of taste and dis - cernment , and
Miss Johnston	PERSON	's carefully elaborated romances have a worth that the fiction-loving Briton
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 knows how to value . ''

		Queed , '' as coming from a new author , excites curiosity both by reason of its puzzling and admirably brief title , and also perhaps because of the rather prepossessing name of the writer .

		Mr.
Robert D. Benedict	PERSON	has retold in modern English a number of '' Stories from the Old French Chronicles , '' finding his material in such matters as the Sieur de Pontis ,
Pierre	PERSON	de 1 ` Estoile ,
Bertrand du Guesclin	PERSON	, and others .

		His volume is prettily published by Mr.
Richard G. Badger	PERSON	.

		A collection of posthumous studies by the late Ed - mund
Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, entitled `` Genius and Other Essays , '' is a welcome announcement from Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This firm has also in press the '' Memoirs of
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	, '' by his widow ,
Rose Fay Thomas	PERSON	.

		What may be called a supplement to the recently - issued
Wagner Autobiography	ORGANIZATION	exists in the composer 's family letters .

		A translation of these is now being done by Mr.
Ashton Ellis	PERSON	, the author of an exhaustive life of
Wagner	PERSON	, and the book will be published in the course of this
Autumn	DATE	.

		In the '' Eclectic Readings '' of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	we now have '' Stories of
Don Quixote	PERSON	Written Anew for
Young People	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	, and `` The Story of
Modern France	LOCATION	, '' by
Miss H. A. Guerber	PERSON	.

		These books are attractively illustrated , and make very good reading for young people .


John Dennis	PERSON	-LRB- 1657-1734 -RRB- is not exactly a name to conjure with , but he played an important part in his time .

		Particularly as a critic , he made himself disliked by his attacks upon the great writers of the Augustan Age , and they saw to it that his own poems and plays should not win too much applause .

		His stock seems to be coming up at present , and Dr.
H. G. Paul	PERSON	has found the subject of his life and literary activity worthy of an elaborate monograph , which is now published at the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Abbe * Fe `` lix
Klein	PERSON	of
Paris	LOCATION	, who is known as a shrewd observer and critic of
America	LOCATION	and American institutions , has again turned his eye upon this country .

		Having described , in '' The Land of the Strenuous Life , '' the
America	LOCATION	of the present , Abbe *
Klein	PERSON	now competes with Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	and other latter-day prophets in making a forecast of `` America of Tomor - row . ''

		A translation of the work will be published this Fall by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first work to appear from
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's pen since '' The Song of Songs '' is announced for Fall publication by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		It is a story of gay
Berlin	LOCATION	life , entitled `` The Indian Lily , '' in which it is said that the author again displays the unique power of portraying womanhood that made it possible for him to create in '' The Song of Songs '' a type entirely new to fiction .

		In the same volume will appear six shorter stories , forming `` a cycle of womanhood '' a gallery of femininity , in varying phases from the common to the finest spiritual type .

		The authorship of '' The Great Illusion , '' that widely circulated and logically persuasive irenicon published -LRB- in half a dozen languages -RRB- under the pseudonym of ''
Norman Angells	PERSON	, '' has now become an open secret .

		Mr.
Ralph Lane	PERSON	, manager of the
Paris	LOCATION	edition of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Mail , '' and a young man of alertness and initiative -LRB- if one can judge from his portrait -RRB- is the genius to whom we owe this contribution to the cause of universal peace , a cause that is likely to be still further promoted by the generous action of a wealthy
London	LOCATION	philanthropist who is reported to have given twenty thousand pounds to make the book still more widely known .

		Mr.
A. Maurice Low	PERSON	, the second volume of whose study in national psychology , '' The American People , '' will be published this Fall , denies that the effect of immigration is to drag down the level of American civilization .

		He endeavors to prove the contrary in doing the work that the native son scorns , the im mi - grant causes him to seek work requiring greater ability and giving more remuneration , and is thus the lev er by which the native is moved up a notch or two in the scale of social efficiency .

		Luther 's greatest service to the world , in the opinion of Dr.
McGiffert	PERSON	, whose book on Luther will be pub - lished this Fall , was his recognition of the normal human relationships , including those of the sexes .

		Where the religious teachers of the Middle Ages had represented woman as a necessary evil and a temptation to a less perfect way of living , Luther saw in her one ordained of God to be the companion and helpmate of man , a vocation greater than that of the nunnery , as i t provided the sphere in which the highest religious and moral character could be developed .

		In preaching the union instead of the separation of man and woman ,
Luther	PERSON	did much to bring religion from the abnormal to the normal .

		The death of
Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	, who put an end to her life on the seventeenth of
August	DATE	, at her home in
Chicago	LOCATION	, will bring a sense of personal loss to many thousands of readers .

		Her books took the public into her confidence , and the public showed its appreciation by buying them to the number of hundreds of thous - ands .

		For the last few years , she has been one of the most widely-read of American novelists , and , if her readers got little more than sentiment and whimsical invention from her books , they at least got nothing that was harmful .


Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	belonged to a family many of whose members have literary and artistic interests , and her own literary bent was predetermined by the influences that surrounded her childhood .

		She had hardly been graduated from the high school before she began to make a living by her pen , and she was early successful in her efforts .

		She was married about five years ago to Mr.
James Sydney McCullough	PERSON	, and was in her thirty-seventh year when she died .

		A forthcoming life of the late Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	, which is among the good things to be expected in the near future , will be distinguished by certain unconventional and highly welcome features .

		The necessary outline of the eminent Shakespearean scholar 's life and work will be agreeably supplemented by chapters of anecdote and reminiscence from a number of his friends , includ - ing Dr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	, Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, Sir
James Murray	PERSON	, and Mr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	.

		There was so much to Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	besid Shakespearean scholarship he was , among other things , a dexterous oarsman and founder of the
Furnivall Sculling Club	ORGANIZATION	that these reminiscences from various sources promise to be of varied and very human interest .

		The profits from the sale of the book , which ought to be considerable , are said to be destined for the benefit of the above - mentioned boat club , whose establishment was conceived by its founder as a vigorous protest against the absurd English notion that rowing is a sport for the gentry alone .

KENNEDY	PERSON	SQUARE '' is a story of the Old South ; of
Baltimore	LOCATION	particularly , for there , as the readers of '' The Fortunes of
Oliver Horn	PERSON	'' already know , the picturesque old square is situated .

		The love story turns on this clash in ideals .

		Young
Harry Rutter	PERSON	is the very expression of the cavalier spirit , which approves dueling and winks at the lesser vices .

		This , through the duel he feels bound to fight , leads to his estrangement from the heroine and his subsequent romantic struggle to win her again .

		An adequate and brilliant account of the life of this great American composer and leader , by his widow . ''

		In describing his achievements , I have used , so far as possible , the words of others chiefly of eminent professional critics or musicians who personally attended the great musical events under his leadership , and wrote the articles I have quoted while the impression created by them was still fresh and vivid in their minds . ''

		Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	has completed her task with great success , and , what is more , she has finally put together this material in such a manner as to make

NEW YORK	LOCATION	1911 -RSB- THE DIAL 173 -LRB- JUST OUT -RRB- Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism By
FRANZ CUMONT	PERSON	.

		With an introductory essay by GRANT SHOWERMAN .

		Authorized Translation .

		Pp. 320 .

		Cloth ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	net -LRB- 8s .

		6d . -RRB- ''

		The Propagation of the Oriental religions with the development of Neo-Platonism is the leading fact in the moral history of the pagan empire .

		Theologians , by reason of their intellectual bent and education , were for a long time more inclined to consider the continuity of the Jewish tradition than the causes that disturbed it ; but a reaction has taken place , and to-day they endeavor to show that the church has borrowed considerably from the conceptions and ritualistic ceremonies of the pagan mysteries .

		In spite of the prestige that surrounded Eleusis , the word `` mysteries '' calls up
Hellenized Asia	LOCATION	rather than
Greece	LOCATION	proper , because in the first place the earliest Christian communities were founded , formed , and developed in the heart of Oriental populations , Semites .

		Phrygians , and Egyptians .

		Moreover the religions of those people were much farther advanced , much richer in ideas and sentiments , more striking and stirring than the Greco-Latin anthropomorphism .

		Their liturgy always derives its inspiration from generally accepted beliefs about purification embodied in certain acts regarded as sanctifying .

		These facts were almost identical in the various sects .

		The new faith poured its revelation into the hallowed moulds of earlier religions because in that form alone could the world in which it developed receive its message .

		This is approximately the point of view adopted by the latest historians . ''

37 %	PERCENT	1w 2 Yo R S K treet ' Dr.
Denton J. Snider	PERSON	is regarded by the European intellectual world as one of the greatest living philosophers and thinkers .

		In this country he is best known as the author of widely read Commentaries on
Shakespeare , Dante	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		These essays rank as masterpieces throughout the literary world .

		From
1864	DATE	to 1867 Professor
Snider	PERSON	taught Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, English Literature , Mathematics and History in the
Chris	PERSON	- tian
Brothers ' College	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		This was followed by ten years 1 teaching in the St.LouisHigh School , during which time Professor
Snider	PERSON	added
Mental Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	,
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to his subjects .

		Since
1877	DATE	he has given his entire time to lecturing and the preparation of Uni - versal Psychology .

		In
1894	DATE
Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	conferred a degree upon Pro- fessor
Snider	PERSON	, '' her greatest scholar . ''

		Eight years later Dr.
Snider	PERSON	, who for some time had been living in
Chicago	LOCATION	, returned to
St. Louis	LOCATION	at the earnest solicitation of the
St. Louis Society of Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, an organization of several hundred members , formed for the study of
Universal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Snider	PERSON	is the author of thirty - four vol - umes , which include works on litera - ture , biography , art , music , architec - ture and philosophy .

		PSYCHOLOGY The New Science Universal By Dr.
DENTON J. SNIDER	PERSON	Of deep interest to all thinking people , the salient character of
Universal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	may be indicated in the fact that it is neither metaphysical nor physical in method or matter , but purely psychological .

		Slowly the science of Psychology has been pushing to the front as the
Universal Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it has been hitherto handicapped by alien methods foisted upon it .

		So we have had chiefly two kinds : the old Rational -LRB- so - called -RRB- Psychology , dominated by the metaphysical system of some phil - osopher , and the more recent
Psychological Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, dominated by the procedure of
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present system maintains a view opposite to , yet inclusive of both these methods .

		Psychology is proclaimed the master of the house , no longer the subordinate ; it is to organize Philosophy and
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	, and not to be organized by them .

		It is the new
Universal Science	ORGANIZATION	and openly asserts itself as a system in spite of to-day 's pragmatic prejudice against all systems .

		The only work of this kind wrought out to completion in the English language .

		BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		As far as the publishers have informed us , we print to-day our semi-annual classified list of the new books that are supposed to be forth - coming during the Fall and
Winter	DATE	months .

		It is a lengthy list , as usual , and would be occasion for despair did we not know how large a fraction of its contents might be neglected by even the most omnivorous reader without suffering any very serious loss .

		Many of its promises will doubtless turn out to be disappointments , but , on the other hand , it is pretty certain to contain some titles which , meaning nothing in the bare announcement , will eventually be found to stand for unanticipated delights .

		The genuine Book for such a phenomenon really occurs now and then is more likely than not to come without much observation , and make insignificant many showier tomes that have been heralded with the blare of trumpets .

		We did not hear much about ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' and '' The Old Wives ' Tale , '' for example , before they actually came to hand , but it did not take long to discover their quality .

		Again , it is more than likely that the season 's output will include works that are not even an - nounced at the present time , but that will out - rank the best of those whose appearance has been awaited .

		Last year 's experience gave us such a work in the
Wagner	PERSON	autobiography , which was published with little preliminary parade , and which was probably the most impor - tant publication of the whole year .

		There is certainly nothing of comparable im - portance among the biographies now catalogued for production , and the chief impression one gets from the list is that the business of biog - raphy is greatly overdone .

		It is , as we have frequently before pointed out , a peculiarly Anglo-American business , and the French or German reader is apt to be amazed at the unim - portance of most of the lives that are thought by somebody to be worth writing about in the English language * Then , if a man is of con - siderable prominence , we are fairly sure to have several lives of him instead of the one that might be thought sufficient .

		There is usually the '' official '' biography , which is apt to be preceded by sketchy affairs hastily put together after his death , to be followed by lives written from some special angle of observation , and to be supple - mented by lives prepared for the innumerable 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, biographical series that some publishers have a mania for projecting .

		All of these categories may be illustrated from this year 's list .

		We are to have new biographies of
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, Tolstoy -LRB- two -RRB- ,
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, Maupassant -LRB- by his valet -RRB- ,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	,
Napoleon	PERSON	, Luther ,
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, and
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	a miscellaneous group , surely , of most of whose members we are already rather well informed .

		The new
Ruskin	PERSON	biography , by Mr.
Edward Tyas Cook	PERSON	, is the only one of the lot that promises to be of much value .

		Fresher of interest , of course , are the promised biographies or memoirs of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	,
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	,
Francisco Ferrer	PERSON	,
M. Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	, Mr.
G. B. Shaw	PERSON	, Senator Cullom , Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	, Mr.
Booker	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	, and Presi - dent
J. B. Angell	PERSON	.

		But we are not made exactly eager even by these prospects .

		Most of the books will be pleasant to read , and informing , but they could be spared .

		We do not find the historical list especially promising .

		Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	's work on
Cavour	PERSON	and Mr.
George Macaulay Trevelyan	PERSON	's work on
Garibaldi	PERSON	will renew our acquaintance with the history of the Italian Risorgimento in a way that can not fail to be interesting .

		Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	's collection of '' Studies Military and Diplomatic '' will doubtless give us a fresh and incisive treatment of whatever their themes may be .

		Mr.
James Harvey Robinson	PERSON	is one of the most thoughtful and scholarly of American writers in this field , and his volume entitled `` The New History '' can not fail to be profitable .

		Other title * that attract attention are : '' A History of the American Bar , '' by Mr.
Charles Warren	PERSON	; '' Kansas in the Sixties , '' by Mr.
Samuel J. Crawford	PERSON	; '' The Women of the Caesars , '' by
Signor Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	; '' The Annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	; and '' The Common People of Ancient Rome , '' by Mr.
Frank Frost Abbott	PERSON	.

		We note also that the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Mediaeval History '' is now ready for launching , and that its first volume may soon be expected .

		Books of travel constitute a category that supplies interesting and even fascinating read - ing , although few such books are treasured as permanent additions to literature .

		We can hardly expect an ''
Eothen	ORGANIZATION	, '' or a Palgrave 's Arabia , or a Dufferin 's '' Letters from High Latitudes '' every year , but there is much promise in such forthcoming works as '' From Constantinople to the Home of
Omar Khay	PERSON	- yam , '' by Professor
A. V. Williams Jackson	PERSON	; `` The Arctic Prairies , '' by Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	; '' Argentine Plains and Andean Gla - ciers , '' by Mr.
Walter Larden	PERSON	; '' South Amer - ica of To-day , '' by
M. Georges Clemenceau	PERSON	; '' With Pack and Rifle through Trackless Lab - rador , by Mr.
H. Hesketh Pritchard	PERSON	; ''
Undis	PERSON	- covered
Russia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Stephen Grahame	PERSON	; '' Across
China	LOCATION	on Foot , '' by Mr.
Edwin J. Dingle	PERSON	; and `` A Motor Flight through
Algeria	LOCATION	and
Tunisia	LOCATION	, '' by Mrs.
Edward Ayer	PERSON	.

		The category of general literature seems to give the most promise in the direction of the essay , which will be exemplified by such volumes as these : '' Beauty and Ugliness , '' by
Vernon Lee	PERSON	; '' Memories and Studies , '' by
William James	PERSON	; `` Some Representative American Story - Tellers , '' by Mr.
Frederick Taber Cooper	PERSON	; '' Genius and Other Essays , '' by
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	; and '' Democracy and Poetry , '' by Mr.
Francis B. Gummere	PERSON	.

		Of somewhat larger scope are such works as that of Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	on ''
J. M. Synge	PERSON	and the
Ireland	LOCATION	of His Time '' and that of Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	on '' The American Dramatist . ''

		The '' Letters of
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	, '' edited by Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	, will be sure of an appre - ciative circle of readers .

		The American public , which is now getting into the habit of reading plays as well as of seeing them on the stage , will be given several in printed form : `` Mona , '' by Mr.
Brian Hooker	PERSON	; `` Embers , '' by Mr.
George Middleton	PERSON	; '' Disraeli , '' by Mr.
Louis N. Parker	PERSON	; `` Sherwood ,
Robin Hood	PERSON	, and the Three Kings , '' by Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	; '' As a Man Thinks , '' by Mr.
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	; `` The Piercing Sword , '' by Mr.
Charles Rann Kennedy	PERSON	; and probably many more not thus far definitely announced .

		In mentioning works of fiction , we hardly know where to begin or where to end .

		The following novels are at least among those that will be awaited with the greatest interest : '' The Song of Renny , '' by Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	; '' The Witness for the
Defence	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	; '' A Likely Story , '' by Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	; ''
Hilda Lessways	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	; '' The Fruitful Vine , '' by Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	; '' Under Western Eyes , '' by Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	; ''
Adrian Savage	PERSON	, '' by
Lucas Malet	PERSON	; '' The Money Moon , '' by Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	; `` A Safety Match , '' by Mr.
Ian Hay	PERSON	; '' The Principal Girl , '' by Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	; '' The Case of
Richard Meynell	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	; '' The Composer , '' by Mr. and Mrs. Castle ; '' The Inside of the Cup , '' by Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	; `` The
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 185 Healer , '' by Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	; `` The Iron Woman , '' by Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	; '' The Conflict , '' by

F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	; and ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		Here are a dozen from the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and half that number from our own .

		It mast be regretfully admitted that the English list is much the more important of the two .

		THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COME AGAIN .

		The Tolcanic period is over for the present , the crust of the earth is cooling .

		Human opinion , which for a century and a half has swayed with the fluidity of fire , is becoming fixed .

		Life is growing more and more sober , and sensible , and dull .

		En - thusiasm is at a discount .

		Faith is doomed and the ideal is damned .

		We have deposed the gods and taken up with common humanity .

		The ordinary appeals to us rather than the exceptional .

		Smugness and snugness for us , and to the deuce with illimitable aspirations , unselfish heroisms , and profundities that hare to do with the dark foundations of our estate .

		After its outlaw escapades with
Karl Moor	PERSON	and
Fra Diavolo	LOCATION	, mankind has gone back to the domination of the policeman and the parish beadle .

		We think more of the tariff to-day than of our im - mortal souls , and more of motor cars and the social column of the newspaper than of either .

		Under such circumstances it is natural that there should be a renewal of interest in the English eight - eenth century .

		A common feeling binds that epoch to ours .

		The strongest instincts then as now were the instincts for material welfare , and common sense .

		Man social rather than man solitary is our chief study now as then .

		In both periods talent more than genius comes to fruition .

		Accordingly we have had of late a revival of eighteenth-century literature .

		There has been a wide commemoration of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, almost a new coronation of that ponderous Dictator of Letters who is again accepted as expressing the most native and permanent factors of English character and thought .

		Certainly he has not been treated with so much reverence since he laid down his sceptre with his life .

		Biographies , studies , editions of other writers of that brilliant epoch , have appeared in quick suc - cession .

		Pope has been studied in his strength and weakness .

		The melancholy and mighty Swift bas been sympathetically analyzed .


Sterne	PERSON	's mockery and pathos have been critically fixed .

		Goldsmith and
Sheridan	PERSON	have been rehabilitated as to their lives , and set more securely on their thrones of fame .

		It is doubtful if there has ever before been so thor - ough an exposition or such a profound appreciation of these writers and others of their kin and kind .

		All this is only just , and it is perhaps a fortunate turn of appreciation after the '' chatter about Har - riet '' and the discussions about Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	which threatened to swamp our criticism a decade ago .

		The critics of the Romantic school wrote such ineffable nonsense about
Shelley	PERSON	and Hugo and others , that the swing of the pendulum of taste backward and downward was as desirable as it was inevitable .

		But the danger now is that the pendulum will stop at its nadir , at the lowest possible point .

		The common-sense of mankind is a kind of gravitation which is always tending to bring everything to a halt .

		We have got to recognize that there is a higher and a lower glory in literature .

		At bottom , the question is between poetry and prose .

		By poetry I do not , of course , mean merely verse , though the movement , the rhythm , the con - certed sweep of verse , is a symbol of that life-giving element which is poetry , just as the disintegration , the dissonance of prose is a symptom of that static condition of existence which we call matter .

		The poetic view of life is a whole view , the prose out - look a partial one .

		Poetry globes itself .

		In its small - est example , it gives us action , character , light and shade , reality and reflection , foreground and distance , this world and the next .

		Prose generally runs off in some single direction ; it is one-sided .

		It deals with axioms , maxims , half truths or half experiences .

		Wit and humor mean disintegration .

		The orb of the universe is shattered and the fragments run about in glittering confusion .

		Prose is therefore the vehicle for humor .

		The English eighteenth century is perhaps the most remarkable prose epoch in litera - ture , and taken altogether it is marked by the most varied and original outburst of wit and humor ever known .

		Single wits and humorists there are , strown through the ages , superior to any man of this period ; but as a group ,
Dryden	PERSON	, Pope , Swift , Wycherley.Con - greve ,
Vanburgh	LOCATION	,
Farquhar	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	,
Steele	PERSON	,
Addison	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	, Fielding , Smollett.and
Burns	PERSON	have never been equalled .

		And in colloquial wit , Doctor
Johnson	PERSON	dominates the centuries .

		This is the largest galaxy of brilliant stars in our literature .

		Pre-Shakespearean literature has dwindled to two names Chaucer and Spenser .

		In spite of all the efforts of critics ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's contem - poraries and rivals have faded from the sky .

		Milton is alone in his heaven .

		But the lights of the eighteenth century support each other in their multitude .

		They paled a little before the fiery dawn of the Romantic revival , but they were visible in its full daylight , and now they promise to become dominant again .

		What the eighteenth-century literature had su - premely was common sense .

		It was in full corre - spondence with the thoughts and affairs of the aver - age man .

		And it did not deal with him as a king of nature , still less as the mystic tenant of eternity .

		It confined its view of him to his social and political doings and relations .

		Its moralities and maxims and irony and comedy were all of the world worldly the multifarious history of Vanity Fair .

		What the eighteenth-century literature did no.t have were those vibrations of the soul which shake man out of self those tidal agitations which heave up 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, landmarks and make a new geography of the mind .

		Except near the close of the epoch , in
Burns	LOCATION	, it pro- duced no writer with the central fire in him .

		Except in its few disinherited children , the poets Gray , Col - lins ,
Chatterton	PERSON	, it has nothing of vision and charm , nothing of the full-rounded revelation of life .

		A spir - itual Desert of
Sahara	LOCATION	, it stretched from the roots of the forests and mountain ranges of English thought , flat , dry , hard in its unfructifying common-sense .

		Men could not stand it .

		They thirsted for the water-springs of the spirit , hungered for the rises and ranges of life .

		Moved by a common impulse , they left the levels and struggled on toward the heights .

		Millions perished by the way ; errors and excesses and orgies marked their path ; but for a time the race was better than it had been a nobil - ity was re-born in man .

		Romance , Beauty , the Supernatural , came back ; and literature blossomed and bourgeoned as it has only done a few times in the history of the world .

		Now this impulse seems to be spent .

		We are falling back into the eighteenth-century mood .

		There are differences , of course .

		In thought , we have substituted the idea of evolution for rational - ism ; in form we have put the novel in the place of satire or didactic form .

		But for absolute poetry the poetry of imagination and beauty we have the same disinclination as our forefathers had then .

		Tragedy is again abhorent to us , and we wreak our souls on humor and social comedy .

		It is perhaps worth while to hunt about for a concrete contrast of these rival schools of thought and art .

		Shelley is the extreme example of the Romance revival .

		He carried its banners to its farthest point .

		Thackeray , on the other hand , is one earlier reincarnation of the eighteenth century the man who re-expressed its ideals , or want of ideals .

		As far as their lives were concerned , the comparison would , at first blush , seem to be favor - able to
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		But it is as writers that we have most interest in them ; and which must we prefer
Shelley	PERSON	with the throb and thrill and ecstasy in his voice which take our hearts , the aerial visions shot through with golden fire which refresh our minds , or
Thackeray	PERSON	with his polite and incredulous smile and his pictures of a sordid and soulless world !

		In the very best literature we get the noble vision and reality combined beauty and grandeur and truth in one .

		But we do not get it in the work of any age which banishes poetry ; we do not get it in the literature of the eighteenth century , or in our own which expresses the same mood .

		Certainly we have no need to preach common-sense or comic irony in
America	LOCATION	.

		We wear
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	in our dispositions , and are not likely to go astray in the direction of enthusiasm , passion , profundity , or to sacrifice to eccentric and exceptional gods .

		The eighteenth-century revival can do us no good it will only confirm us in our faults .

		The prose view of life is too much with us as it is .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		LESSONS FROM THE OUTSIDES OF BOOKS that havs seen service are writ so large that even he who run .

		through the alcoves of a library may read thems The human preference for amusement to instruc - tion , and for easy and simple to strenuous studies , becomes at once apparent from the frayed and stained and re-bound condition of fiction and humor and popular science , as contrasted with the unworn and comparatively spotless dress of more profound and scholarly works .

		But more f `` rious , and signi - ficant of another trait in readers , is the external aspect of almost any single volume that is read at all .

		The darkening of the leaves ' lower edges , resulting from thumb-pressure , is nearly alwaye greatest in , if not confined to , the first part of the book .

		Scrutinize a library copy of
Darwin	PERSON	's '' Origin of Species '' or '' Descent of Man , '' and you will find the later pages surprisingly fair and fresh , in contrast with the dog-eared and finger-marked ear - lier ones a sad proof of the weakness of human perseverance .

		This , too , may be seen without open - ing the book , but by merely examining its lower edge .

		Standard works in several volumes com - monly exhibit a marked difference in the condition of the earlier and later volumes , the wear decreas - ing rapidly toward the end , and the re-binding being ordinarily confined to the first one or two volumes .

		Yet something else than human incon - stancy may also be deduced as accountable for this .

		When a reader gets fairly into the swing of his author , he reads much more rapidly and easily than at the beginning , thumbing the pages less and turn - ing the leaves faster , even as the book of life is inclined to run off in its later portions with con - siderably less wear and tear , less painful spelling out of the words , than in its opening chapters .

		In short , who shall say that a complete analysis and description of human nature might not be made from a sufficiently keen-eyed scrutiny of a public library 's bookshelves ?

		THE INTELLECTUAL FERMENT IN
LATIN AMER	LOCATION	-
ICA	ORGANIZATION	has been commented on several times in THE DIAL .

		Scattered through
Cuba	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, and
South America	LOCATION	, there have sprung up recently various groups of poets , critics , and thinkers , who are work - ing with a common impulse toward a new birth of Spanish literature in the new world .

		In a pre - face to the Cuestiones Estbticas of
Alfonso Reyes	PERSON	, published at
Paris	LOCATION	,
Seiior Francisco Garcia Calderdn	PERSON	writes as follows of some modern Mexican authors : ''
Alfonso Reyes	PERSON	belongs to a sympathetic group of writers , a little Mexican Academy for free discus - sion of Platonic ideas .


Pedro Henriquez Urefia	PERSON	, son of the poetess
Salom ^ Urefia	PERSON	, is the Socrates of this fraternal group .

		He will be one of the most certain glories of American thought .

		Critic and philosopher , he is a soul evangelical and protestant , eager for great problems and profoundly versed in
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 Spanish and Italian literature .

		Joined with him are
Antonio Caso	PERSON	, a philosopher deeply schooled in
Nietzsche	LOCATION	and Comte , sunken in meditation , elo - quent , the creator of beautiful syntheses ; Je ` sus
I. Acevedo	PERSON	, great architect of ideas , distant and melan - choly , lost in the contemplation of his visions ;
Max Henriquez Urefia	PERSON	, brother of
Pedro	LOCATION	, artist , journalist , and brilliant musical critic ;
Alfonso Craviolo	PERSON	, art critic , and others various and fine , whose affection for noble idealism harmonizes with the richest variety of special scientific knowledge .

		Among these ,
Alfonso Reyes	PERSON	is the
Benjamin	LOCATION	.

		He is the son of General
Bernado Reyes	PERSON	, Governor of a
Mexican State	ORGANIZATION	and a rival of
Porforio Diaz	PERSON	. ''

		It is noticeable that all these new Latin American au - thors hold by
France	LOCATION	.

		French literature and ideas dominate the movement .

		On the other hand , of the space which French and Italian periodicals and newspapers devote to American doings , literary or political , nine-tenths is given up to
Latin America	LOCATION	.

		The
United States	LOCATION	usually follows on a bad second to some little republic of the South whose existence we habitually ignore .

		There would seem to be a lesson in this for us to recognize our neighbors who are recognized by a great part of the world .

		THE OLD-TIME TITLE-PAGE , no niggard of print - er 's ink , and honestly striving to convey a full and true conception of the contents of the book to which it is prefixed , has a picturesqueness and charm un - known to its abbreviated modern successor .

		Mr.
J. H. Whitty	PERSON	of
Richmond	LOCATION	has prepared , and the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	has published , '' A Record of
Virginia	LOCATION	Copyright Entries -LRB- 1790-1844 -RRB- . ''

		The
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	passed a resolution in
1783	DATE	recommending to the several States a copyright law , and this resolution was favorably acted upon by
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1785	DATE	.

		Copyright entries were there - after registered in the
United States District Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, until
Congress	ORGANIZATION	transferred the registry of all copyright books to
Washington	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	.

		Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	's pamphlet contains between three hundred and four hundred titles , many of which excite one 's interest , curiosity , or amusement .

		For example , a pansophical writer ,
Joshua Peel	PERSON	, has a book on u Truth and Reason : or , A fair investigation of many of those things which keep them in Shade ; Delivered in a course of Theological Lectures ,
Wherein Truth	ORGANIZATION	is clearly unfolded and defended by reasonable arguments , drawn from the surest Testi - monies of past and present Experience , Historical Evidence , and many plain , undeniable facts . ''

		Another author ,
William Branch , Jr.	PERSON	, attempts a metrical solution of the riddle of existence , his title reading thus : '' Life : A poem in three books de - scriptive of the various characters in life , the differ - ent passions with their moral influence , the good and evil resulting from their sway , and of the per - fect man .

		Dedicated to the social and political welfare of the pe9ple of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Another treatise modestly offers '' A Plain element - ary explanation of the nature and cure of disease , -LSB- founded -RSB- upon facts and experience ; presenting a view of that train of thinking which led to the inven - tion of the patent portable , warm and hot Bath . ''

		And still we have disease , are still teased and puz - zled by life , still search for truth and reason , and shall continue to write books in fancied solution of some of these perennial problems , in scecula sceculorum .

		... THE HORATIAN VIEW OF A SUMMER VACATION , or of a vacation journey in quest of repose and refreshment , has long been familiar to the world from the poet 's epistle to Bullatius , and may per - haps be recalled with advantage now that the vaca - tion season has drawn to a close for some of us , while for others the season has passed without bringing the vacation .

		If we are to believe
Horace	PERSON	, the vacationers need not be envied by the non - vacationers ; for did he not prove to his restless , globe-trotting friend that happiness has nothing to do with change of climate or place , but depends entirely on one 's state of mind ? ''

		Coslum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt '' runs the familiar line that forms the kernel to the nutshell of advice contained in the brief letter .

		And if those of us who have been unable to go abroad this
summer	DATE	, to see the Coronation and other sights , wish additional consolation , is it not ready to our hand in
Emerson	LOCATION	's essay on Heroism ?

		`` Why should these words ,
Athenian	ORGANIZATION	, Roman ,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, so tingle in the ear ?

		Where the heart is , there the muses , there the gods sojourn , and not in the geog - raphy of fame .


Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
Connecticut River	LOCATION	, and
Boston Bay	LOCATION	, you think paltry places , and the ear loves names of foreign and classic topography .

		But here we are ; and , if we will tarry a little , we may come to learn that here is best . ''

		Thus the true vacation , like the real
Boston	LOCATION	, may be said to have no physical existence , but to be simply '' a state of mind '' even though a three months ' leave of absence , with a letter of credit in four figures , is not exactly despicable to anyone who is human and who is sometimes weary with toiling for his daily bread ... AN INSTITUTE TO PKOMOTE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS GERMAN is announced as about to open in
Berlin	LOCATION	, with quarters in the new
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	, under the official patronage of the government , and with the valuable aid of teachers and professors in the higher schools and the university .

		The purpose is to interest and instruct educated foreigners , so - journing in the city , in the language , the literature , the art and industry , the ideals and aims , the scien - tific and other achievements , of our Teutonic friends and rivals .

		Both class-room lectures and personally conducted excursions will be resorted to for the en - lightenment of the foreign visitor .

		Each '' semester , '' as it is called , though the term here loses its ety - mological significance , will be eight weeks in length ; and a moderate fee -LRB- one hundred marks -RRB- will be charged for participation in this feast of reason and international flow of soul .


October 16	DATE	is fixed as 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the date for inaugurating this promising and praise - worthy enterprise , which ought to accomplish some - thing toward dispelling that widely prevalent Germanophobia which has its roots in ignorance and a false conception of patriotism .

		THE DEADLY DULNESS OF IMMORAL LITERATURE , as a rule , must have impressed itself on many a catholic-minded reader who has had the courage and perseverance to prove all things in the domain of books , with a view to holding fast that which is good .

		Mayor
Gaynor	PERSON	the other day deftly , though perhaps unintentionally , exposed the real weakness of the morally objectionable book in his comment on a certain work that had been for some reason banned by the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is reported as having said to a woman who protested against the library 's action : '' I looked it through
last night	TIME	after trying hard to read it consecutively .

		I am satisfied that the notion of the author that his book was excluded on moral grounds is erroneous .

		It is quite harmless , but very stupid .

		It must have been rejected on that ground .

		I can not help call - ing to mind that scene of Cervantes in which he pictures the priest , the barber , and the niece , sitting in judgment on the books of
Don Quixote	PERSON	's library , sparing a few , but committing all the others to the flames , and especially the stupid ones .

		If this book had been there I am certain it would not have escaped the flames . ''

		A NEW TREATMENT OF THE FAUST LEGEND may confidently be expected if
M. Rostand	PERSON	, lately the unfortunate victim of an automobile accident in
France	LOCATION	, carries out his reported intention of trying his hand at the theme that has challenged a
Marlowe	PERSON	, a
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, a
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	, and countless others , known and unknown .

		Here certainly is an opportunity for him to surpass his previous popular successes and to rise to hitherto unattained heights .

		Yet poets like other men are the victims of their own pecu - liar endowments ; and any drama , with whatever motif , from the brilliant author of `` Cyrano '' and `` Chantecler '' is very sure to be unmistakably
Rostandesque	PERSON	, out of the ordinary , attention - compelling , something more than a nine days ' wonder , but not free from the inevitable defects of its qualities .

		Goethe 's laurels are not yet in danger .

		THE NOVEL OF THE FLYING-MACHINE may SOOn be expected to displace the now somewhat stale romance of the motor-car .

		This is the prospect as it opens itself to the experienced vision of sundry publishers of popular fiction .

		Who are to be the Williamsons of the coming type of best - selling thriller ?

		Or will that talented pair aim now a little higher -LRB- at the fleecy sky instead of along the mac - adamized road -RRB- , and repeat in another realm the success achieved by their '' Lightning Conductor '' and '' Scarlet Runner '' ?

		The assured touch of the actual flyer , however , can not for some time yet be expected from one novelist out of a thousand ; and until flying is something more than a mystery and a marvel to the great reading public , the aviation novel can not make an irresistible and universal appeal .

		Wonderful it must be , but not beyond the limit of a sufficiently common experience .

		Mr.
Grahame-White	PERSON	has named thirty years as the time within which transatlantic passenger traffic by airship on a large scale may be looked for ; but the aeronautic novel , in some form more realistic and convincing than
Jules Verne	PERSON	's '' From the Earth to the Moon , '' will come much sooner .

		THE BEST PROPAEDEUTIC TO AUTHORSHIP , COn - cludes '' The Athenaeum '' after making a study of nearly three hundred British writers of note , all but fifty-two of whom were found to have received more or less formal schooling , including often some professional training , '' is the combination of public school and university , set off preferably with a call to the bar or ordination , though a medical degree as an extra is by no means to be underrated .

		An expensive and long training for a very precarious calling ! ''

		Such researches as this in the antece - dents of men of mark are always interesting to the curious inquirer , but will hardly reveal the secret of genius .

		Doubtless we may discover the best train - ing for a historian , or a lexicographer , or a writer of school textbooks or of treatises on embryology or conchology ; and to some extent the education of a professor of literature , English , French , German ,
Latin	LOCATION	, or Greek , can be prescribed ; but the pro- ducer of real literature it is most fortunately , we believe beyond our power to make .

		CO M M UNICA TIONS .

		THE
CHICAGO	LOCATION	AND
NEW YORK	LOCATION	THEATRICAL EXPERIMENTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The discussion , in your columns and elsewhere , of the plans and prospects of the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	has greatly interested me , as it must interest all who have at heart the rehabilitation of the American stage .

		It brings , of course , prominently into view the recent expe - riences of the New Theatre of
New York	LOCATION	, a dramatic experiment widely welcomed as a bow of promise in our theatrical sky , its successes greeted with delight , and its failures with a regret tempered by the hope that its managers would profit by their mistakes to make their future the more assured .

		Surely the lessons they have had may be conned with profit by all others proposing to follow in like paths .

		In one particular the
Chicago Society	ORGANIZATION	starts without the handicaps of the
New York	LOCATION	players .

		I refer to the matter of building ; and I realize how surprising the statement may well seem , for the home which the New Theatre backers gave to it was as beautiful , as comfort - able , and as complete in all respects as could easily be imagined .

		None the less , this same house was one of the causes of the temporary setback which the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	undertaking met .

		Its very roominess , which made it difficult for the audience to see and hear satisfactorily , also unfitted it for the purposes of a repertory company , governed by a policy which prevented the continuance of any production for what could be considered a long
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 run , no matter how popular it might have proved to be .

		It was a very splendid white elephant but yet a white elephant ; and it had to be abandoned .

		In smaller quarters , adequate without being extravagant , the New Theatre managers may continue their laudable efforts without that handicap , at least .


Chicago	LOCATION	may well profit by this mistake of the
New York	LOCATION	venture , and may also pay attention to another matter which has been referred to by the Director of the
New York	LOCATION	enterprise as a serious drawback to their work namely , the lack of `` home-made '' dramatic material to draw upon .

		Many indeed were called , but few could be chosen for the simple but decisive reason that so few were worthy .


England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and Ger - many -LRB- to go no further -RRB- have developed a national lit - erary drama ;
America	LOCATION	has not .

		As Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	frankly put it to us only the other day : `` As against a
Poe	PERSON	, a
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, a Whitman , you have pro- duced no dramatic author comparable with even such lesser European geniuses as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and Sudermann and
Rostand	PERSON	. ''

		It is therefore encouraging to note that it is not the purpose in
Chicago	LOCATION	to stage American plays simply because they are the work of American writers .

		Yet it would seem that the
Chicago Society	ORGANIZATION	, while prop - erly refusing to depend upon `` made in
America	LOCATION	'' dra - matic material , might still stand ready to encourage its production , and thus become an efficient aid to the birth and development of a national dramatic literature of real worth .

		What you have said of the
Chicago Society	ORGANIZATION	's being governed in its choice of plays by their intrinsic merit rather than by a superficial '' popular '' demand or a usually sordid box-office idea , along with the admir - able opinion which you quote from
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	, is so wholly true as to need no further word than may be given in prompt and full endorsement .

		Is there not , however , something worth noting in the
New Theatre	LOCATION	's experiences in this very regard ?

		In the first place , it has set a highly valuable example to all American thea - trical ventures in the minute care taken with what are too often held as merely minor details of management .

		Another point might be made of its sometimes lavish though always artistic stage decorations ; to give a single instance , '' The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	'' was never set more beautifully .

		The promoters of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	movement found , to their surprise , another drawback in the attitude assumed both by New Yorkers themselves and the '' sojourners in their midst , '' who from the outset insisted on seeing in the New Theatre only a millionaires ' plaything .

		I trust that in
Chicago	LOCATION	this will not be true .

		I believe the better class of its theatre-goers are of a sort to recognize in the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's work not only an ambitious and praiseworthy artistic experiment , but also an enter - prise distinctly educational in character .

		A high mis - sion is set before both the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	in its beginnings , and the New Theatre of
New York	LOCATION	in its fresh start .

		These organizations stand , more nearly than anything else we possess , in place of a national theatre .

		As such , they should establish sound tradi - tions , not in acting only , but in authorship .

		They should provide the machinery to keep alive plays of value and artistry which may not have '' caught on '' at once with the pleasure-loving public .

		They should give frequent performances of the recognized masterpieces ; and this , considering the cosmopolitan make-up of our popula - tions , allows them the amplest scope , with Gallic and Germanic and even Slavic repertory to draw upon , as well as English .

		It may not be for them to cause the sun of a national drama to arise , but it is beyond ques - tion that they can help arouse our sleeping play-goers .

		THE POEMS OF
ELIZABETH AKERS ALLEN	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your note upon the recent death of
Elizabeth Akers Allen	PERSON	, you remark , quite truly , that hers is a name practically unknown to the present generation , to whom the announcement of her death occasions no sense of loss .

		Yet there are very few compilations of American verse in which she is not represented .

		For her work had a quality which made it peculiarly quot - able and she suffered much at the hands of antho - logists .

		It was my good fortune to have had some correspondence with her , not long ago , relative to the use of a number of her poems ; and , since she is no longer here to speak for herself , I feel it is only right that her wishes should be made known for the guidance of future compilers . ''

		I have no objection , '' she writes , '' to the use of my verse in compilations , if two condi - tions are observed : first , that the selections are taken from my books , instead of from possibly garbled news - paper versions ; and , second , that the authorship is credited to the name of
Elizabeth Akers	PERSON	, which is the name given on all my title-pages -LRB- save on my first book , which was published under a fictitious name -LSB-
Florence Percy -RSB-	PERSON	, and is out of print , and one which was published anonymously -RRB- , and the only one which I wish to be associated with my literary work .

		Whenever you see any other name given me in print , you may know it is against my often-expressed wish . ''

		These conditions certainly seem reasonable enough ; and the first one is more than justified by the garbled versions of Mrs.
Allen	PERSON	's verse which have somehow got into even the most pretentious anthologies .

		There are three volumes in which practically all of her poems will be found : '' The Silver Bridge , '' published by
Houghton-Mifflin	ORGANIZATION	in
1886	DATE	; `` The High-Top Sweeting , '' published by the Seribners in
1891	DATE	; and '' The Sunset Song , '' published by
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	in
1902	DATE	.

		It was her own opinion that the last of these contained her best work .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		We have read with very great interest Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's review , in your issue of
September 1	DATE	, of Captain
Beecham	PERSON	's ''
Gettysburg	LOCATION	. ''

		The review is written with the frankness of one who knows his subject , and we are sure
Captain Beecham	ORGANIZATION	will appreciate being corrected by so fair a critic .

		We think we perhaps ought to ex - plain that the illustrations in the book were selected by the publishers , and not by the author , so that we and not
Captain Beecham	LOCATION	are responsible for the por - trait purporting to be that of Gen.
Richard B. Garnett	PERSON	.

		This portrait was reproduced from the
Confederate Military History	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- vol .

		If , as Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	states , there is no known picture of Gen.
Richard B. Garnett	PERSON	, we shall have to take this portrait out of the book with the next edition .

		We may mention incidentally that Captain

		190 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, AND LAWYERS ix
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		*
The American Bar	ORGANIZATION	is a large theme for any one man to deal with , and in Mr.
Charles Warren	PERSON	's single - volume '' History of the Amer - ican Bar '' one must not expect to find the sub - ject exhausted .

		Only the older States , and not even all of the original thirteen , have a place in the historical survey , the rise and growth of legal studies and legal practice west of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard receiving hardly a word of mention .

		But within its limits , which embrace the most important and interesting phases of the subject , the book is a careful and authoritative piece of work , enriched with copious selections from noted jurists and others , and amply supplied with such notes and references and bibliograph - ical data as are needed to point the way to more special and technical studies .

		The general reader , and the student of history in its manifold aspects , are those for whom Mr.
Warren	PERSON	writes , hardly less than for the lawyer interested in the growth and ramifications of his profession during the past century and a quarter .

		The plan of the work , which is to some extent an amplification of a sketch contributed to a recent history of the
Harvard Law School	ORGANIZATION	, may be briefly indicated .

		Part one deals with legal conditions in the colonies before the Revolution , the status of the common law as applied by the courts , the method of appointing these courts , some of the more prominent lawyers of the time , legislation concerning the legal profession , the means of education then available to would-be lawyers , and some account of contemporaneous legal conditions in the mother country .

		Part two traces the more important features in the development of the American Bar from our birth as a nation and our establishment of a national supreme court to the year
1860	DATE	.

		Of more than technical interest are the evidences of early pop - ular prejudice against lawyers as a class , a preju - dice by no means extinct at the present time .

		Human interest , too , is not wanting in the cases that were first found of sufficient importance to warrant an appeal to the highest tribunal in the land , and in the personality and methods of the leading lawyers who conducted such cases .

		Bio - graphical details of significance find their way into the book , as do also illuminative passages * A HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN BAR , Colonial and Federal , to the Year

		By

Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		on the origin and development of corporation law , insurance law , patent law , copyright law , labor law , railroad law , and so on .

		An import - ant chapter deals with the codification of the law , and two others enumerate the noteworthy law books published in this country up to
1860	DATE	.

		A `` supplementary chapter '' briefly surveys our later legal literature .

		Prefixed to the body of Mr.
Warren	PERSON	's work is a pertinent selection from
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	's quaint '' Essay upon the Good that is to be Devised and Designed by those who Desire to Answer the Great End of Life and Do Good while they Live . ''

		It rather amusingly shows that as early as
1710	DATE	, long before the `` Phila - delphia lawyer '' had become a proverb for un - scrupulous shrewdness , the professional pleader was often looked upon askance by his worthy neighbors .

		A few sentences will indicate the tone of this `` first American address to lawyers , '' as Mr.
Warren	PERSON	calls it . ''

		A Lawyer should be a Scholar , but , Sirs , when you are called upon to be wise , the main Intention is that you may be wise to do Good .

		... A Lawyer that is a Knave deserves Death , more than a Band of Robbers ; for he profanes the Sanctuary of the Distressed and Betrayes the Liberties of the People .

		To ward off such a Censure , a Lawyer must shun all those Indirect Ways of making Hast to be Rich , in which a man can not be Innocent ; such ways as provoked the Father of Sir
Matthew Hale	PERSON	to give over the Practice of the Law , because of the Extreme Difficulty to preserve a Good Conscience in it . '' ''

		There has been an old Complaint , That a Good Lawyer seldom is a Good Neighbor .

		You know how to Confute it , Gentlemen , by making your Skill in the Law , a Blessing to your Neighborhood .

		You may , Gentle - men , if you please , be a vast Accession to the Felicity of your Countreys ... Perhaps you may discover many things yet wanting in the Law ; Mischiefs in the Execution and Application of the Laws , which ought to be better provided against , Mischiefs annoying of Man - kind , against which no Laws are yet provided .

		The Reformation of the Law , and more Law for the Refor - mation of the World is what is mightily called for . ''

		This may suggest to the student of Milton the latter 's assertion -LRB- quoted by our author -RRB- that `` most men are allured to the trade of law , grounding their purposes not on the prudent and heavenly contemplation of justice and equity which was never taught them , but on the promis - ing and pleasing thoughts of litigious terms , fat contentions and flowing fees . ''

		Slow and feeble was the first growth of the legal profession in a country so dominated as were our northern colonies by the church , or the '' meeting-house , '' as it was scrupulously called .

		Those were the palmy days of the parson as a power in his community , and such neighborhood quarrels as he could not settle
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191 were naturally carried before the '' general court , '' or colonial legislature , for adjudication .

		The evolution of the full-fledged lawyer , not only in this country but in
England	LOCATION	, is an inter - esting subject , and is treated by Mr.
Warren	PERSON	with such fulness as his space permits .

		Educa - tional facilities for the study of the law were necessarily extremely meagre in the colonies .

		Books were scarce , and libraries accessible to the public almost non-existent .

		The author says that '' the first public library was established in
New York	LOCATION	in
1729	DATE	, '' without giving its name .

		Of course this was not what we now mean by the term public library , but even such as it was it had been preceded in
New York	LOCATION	by one of Dr.
Thomas Bray	PERSON	's so-called parish libraries , the parish of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	becoming the beneficiary in
1698	DATE	.

		For our first real public library , or town library , we must come down to the year
1803	DATE	, when
Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	in
Connecticut	LOCATION	is said to have established a collection of books for the general use of its citizens .

		As to that formal teaching of law which was more and more to supersede the desultory instruction available in law offices , it appears that the first American law professorship which was also the second in any English - speaking country was founded in
1779	DATE	at the
College of William and Mary	ORGANIZATION	; and to the action of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, then governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, was due this epoch-making innovation .

		Two chairs , those of divinity and oriental languages , were sacrificed by Governor
Jefferson	PERSON	in the reforms he effected as `` visitor '' of the college .

		But the first law school of any importance in this country was a private one , being the semi - nary established by Judge Tapping
Reeve	PERSON	in
1784	DATE	, and attended by more than a thousand students before it closed its doors in
1833	DATE	.

		Other more or less successful attempts were made to provide law education in public as well as private institutions , but it remained for
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	to found the first public school of law that has maintained a permanent exis - tence .

		It dates from
1817	DATE	, and for the first twelve years of its activity it was conducted by two professors ,
Isaac Parker	PERSON	and
Asabel Stearns	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its subsequent growth and its recent institution of new methods are matters known to those interested in the progress of professional education , but not embraced in the scope of Mr.
Warren	PERSON	's book .

		Our Federal judicial system has an intimate bearing on the history of the
American Bar	ORGANIZATION	, and its rise and development are treated at some length in the eleventh chapter . ''

		By far the most important work which greeted the first
Congress	ORGANIZATION	when it met in
1789	DATE	, '' declares the au - thor , '' was the establishment of a judicial system for the country . ''

		And the honor of drafting the famous statute known as the Judiciary Act , which Mr.
Warren	PERSON	pronounces `` one of the most remarkable and impregnable pieces of legislation ever framed , '' he ascribes chiefly to
Oliver Ells	PERSON	- worth of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, one of the numerous lights of legal learning to whom the book pays deserved tribute .

		Of another
New England	LOCATION	worthy ,
Joseph Story	PERSON	, we gather some interesting infor - mation a few pages later .

		Story had , in
1810	DATE	, argued the celebrated case of
Fletcher vs. Peck	ORGANIZATION	before
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, and had soon afterward been reflected to the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	legislature , which made him its Speaker .

		Before long he was called up higher , being appointed Justice of the court before which he had recently appeared , to fill the vacancy caused by
Creshing	ORGANIZATION	's death . ''

		The appointment of Story was not received with general enthusiasm .

		Among his political opponents it was ridiculed and condemned , ' that Republican poli - tician ,
Joe Story	PERSON	, ' as they called him .

		Others , by reason of his youth and active political course , augured a host of evil consequences .

		He was at this time only thirty-two years old the youngest judge on the bench , and , with the exception of Mr.
Justice Buller	PERSON	on the
King 's Bench	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, the youngest man then ever called to highest judicial station in either country . ''

		In his '' Figures of the Past , '' Mr.
Josiah Quincy , Jr.	PERSON	, has written of the indignation ex - cited by this appointment .

		`` I remember , '' he says , in Mr.
Warren	PERSON	's quotation , '' my father 's graphic account of the rage of the Federalists when '
Joe Story	PERSON	, that country pettifogger , aged thirtyrtwo , ' was made a judge of our highest court . ''

		Thus shorn of their glory are many of our heroes when seen through the eyes of an unenthusiastic contemporary .

		But Story was immeasurably better equipped for his high office than many incumbents of the bench throughout the country until a period not too remote to be remembered by men still living .

		For example , the first chief justice of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	was not a lawyer , and the second , though a
Yale	ORGANIZATION	graduate , was a physician by profession .

		Indeed , as late as 1819 a farmer was clothed with the dignity of supreme judicial functionary in that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This surprising disregard of what seems to us the fitness of things must be ex - plained largely by the general lack of special education and training among those who essayed the practice of law .

		The common law of En - gland was held in little deference , and even when a pleader had the wit to cite an English prece - 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, dent , the court 's ignorance and indifference rendered such citation of little avail .

		One must remember , however , that this primitive state of affairs underwent rather rapid change with the establishment of law schools and the increase of means of intercommunication among the various States .

		Mr.
Warren	PERSON	's citation of illustrative cases adds to the interest and value of his chapters .

		So welcome , in fact , are these concrete embodi - ments of abstract law that one wishes he might have entered more fully into the more celebrated cases .

		The famous
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	case , for instance , in which
Webster	PERSON	so brilliantly distinguished himself , would have furnished some pages of good reading if described in detail instead of being briefly referred to .

		But , again , the scope of the work was not such as to permit this pleasure excursion by the way .

		The book contains so much in its present form , and is so sure to commend itself to all inter - ested in the origin and growth of a most import - ant profession as practised in this country , that it would be ingratitude to persist in picking flaws and finding shortcomings .

		It is , even in the eyes of a layman , a memorable and a scholarly work of its kind .

		THREE CENTURIES OF SHAKESPEARE LITERATURE .

		* In the
year 1599	DATE	,
William Jaggard	PERSON	, an enterprising printer of Fleet Street , issued a miscellaneous collection of poems as '' The Passionate Pilgrime , by
W. Shakespeare	PERSON	. ''

		It is recorded by
Thomas Heywood	PERSON	that Shake - speare was much offended with the publisher for having '' presumed to make so bold with his name . ''

		The whirligig of time brings in more than revenges .

		Whether Shakespeare really took offense may be doubted : the present
William Jaggard	PERSON	gives reasons for holding that there was no occasion for it .

		But if offense there were , the later bearer of the name has made mag - nificent amends , and at the same time helped to vindicate a long defenseless benefactor .

		A complete Shakespeare bibliography , actu - ally assembled in type , is a thing to make one rub incredulous eyes .

		Scholars have long dreamed of such a thing , and not a few have * SHAKESPEARE BIBLIOGRAPHY .

		A
Dictionary of Every Known Issue	ORGANIZATION	of the Writings of our
National Poet	ORGANIZATION	, and of Recorded Opinion Thereon , in the English Language .

		By
William Jaggard	PERSON	.

		With Historical Introduction , Facsimiles , Portraits , and other Illustrations .

		Stratford-on-Avon : At the
Shakespeare Press	ORGANIZATION	, iv .

		Sheep Street , MCMXI .

		had the courage to attempt it ; but one by one they fell by the wayside , or contented themselves with incomplete compilations , until twenty - two years ago
William Jaggard	PERSON	, the British bibliographer , undertook the task , which he admits almost subdued him .

		The magnitude of it can scarcely be exaggerated .

		There was not only a handicap of three centuries to over - come , but there was also what athletes would call a gruelling race at the finish against the ever-increasing speed of the modern press .

		As many as 200 volumes of Shakespearean a are sometimes issued in a single year .

		Of the
1200	DATE	collective editions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works listed in this volume -LRB- not all carried to completion -RRB- , about 200 have appeared since Mr.
Jaggard	PERSON	began his labors .

		Of the 300 separate editions of '' Hamlet '' -LRB- including adaptations , travesties , etc. , but omitting minor American school texts -RRB- , 60 have come out in the same period .

		Thus the field has been enlarged by nearly one-fourth while the work was in compilation .

		What
Francis Meres	PERSON	in
1598	DATE	could accomplish with a few strokes of the pen , requires now this '' heavy toil . ''

		The book is a substantial quarto , beautifully printed in 729 double-column pages , and bound in old English linen , the edition limited and the type distributed .

		It contains over 36,000 entries and references , giving '' minute details and available locations of every known issue of Shakespeare 's writings ; ... likewise of every -LSB- English -RSB- tract , pamphlet , volume , or collec - tion of Shakespearean comment ; of each ana - logue or source , with notes of the passages affected ; of every important contemporary or subsequent allusion to , or article on , the drama - tist or his productions ; of each autograph , genuine or forged ; of all engraved Shake - speare portraits ; with market values of the rarer entries . ''

		All this is made readily acces - sible by a single alphabetical arrangement , and an elaborate system of key-references which catches every important name .

		A liberal inter - pretation has been put upon the phrase , `` every important contemporary or subsequent allu - sion . ''

		If an obscure Restoration tragedy con - tains a prefixed poem with an allusion to Shake - speare , the tragedy is recorded .

		If someone in modern
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	publishes a collection of Shakespearean extracts attached to the names of local public men , as our college students do in the '' josh department '' of their annuals , the publication is entered .

		We note
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Polonius : A Collection of Wise Saws and Modern Instances , '' although the work so enti -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 193 tied is scarcely at all indebted to the creator of Polonius for its contents .

		Such latitude might almost have warranted the inclusion , for exam - ple , of
William Dean Howells	PERSON	's '' A Modern Instance '' or `` The Undiscovered Country . ''

		And , indeed , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is represented by his '' Certain Delightful English Towns . ''

		On the other hand , as a presumable '' source , '' we find '' Tottel 's Miscellany '' recorded -LRB- although not in the first edition , and with no mention of the date of the first -RRB- because `` Howard 's ' Songes and sonnettes ' are thought to have had much influence on Sh when preparing his own ' Sonnets , ' '' and because of '' Slender 's refer - ence in the ' Merry wives ' -LRB- I. , i. -RRB- , ' I had rather than forty shillings I had my book of Songs and sonnets here . ' ''

		This wide scope of the compilation , embrac - ing in addition hundreds of works pertaining to actors , the stage , costumes , and the like , and ex - tending even to such an item as a certain `` Comus edition '' of the '' New Orleans Daily Picayune , '' will make it invaluable to persons of widely divergent interests .

		But the Shakespearean scholar will resort to it oftenest , no doubt , for the record of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own works .

		This fills three hundred of the seven hundred pages .

		The separate pieces , including attributed works like '' Birth of Merlin '' and '' Mucedorus , '' are arranged in alphabetical succession , and the editions of each in chronological order .

		Thus we have not only all important facts and details , but a basis for many interesting deductions . ''

		Hamlet '' leads , as we should expect , with 303 separate entries -LRB- not counting a few in the sup - plement , or `` Aftermath '' -RRB- .

		Since
1864	DATE	the three hundredth anniversary of the poet 's birth only one year -LRB-
1887	DATE	-RRB- has failed to bring forth a separate edition of '' Hamlet '' in some shape , and the year
1880	DATE	brought forth ten editions . ''

		Macbeth '' follows closely with 279 separate entries ; then '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' with 240 , ''
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' with 215 , and '' The Tempest '' with 210 .

		The next in order of frequency are '' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' ''
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' ``
King Lear	PERSON	, '' and '' Othello . ''

		Of the canonical plays , '' Titus Andronicus '' stands lowest , with 39 entries .

		Comparing two of these lists chronologically , we find that in
1865	DATE	'' Othello '' led '' The Tempest '' by 16 separate issues , though now the latter leads the former by 32 .

		It would take closer examina - tion to determine whether this indicates a change of taste , some shifting in the problems of criticism , or merely the fact that ' ' The Tempest ' ' is better adapted for school-room study .

		A very interesting feature is the succinct notes which the compiler has appended to many of the entries .

		For example , after the descrip - tion of '' The Passionate Pilgrime .

		By
W. Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		At
London	LOCATION	: Printed for W. laggard , and are to be sold by
W. Leake	PERSON	, at the Greyhound in

Cambridge	LOCATION	copy bears an early MS. note stat - ing that the copy cost the then owner three-halfpence .

		Trifling though this sum appears , it will be found , if calculated from
1600	DATE	at
5 %	PERCENT	compound interest , to work out to several thousand pounds , or , roughly , its market value to-day .

		A copy changed hands privately in
1907	DATE	at 2,000 , and crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		This transaction thus represents the highest price yet paid for a separate piece of Sh . ''

		Then , not without a touch of feeling , '' Including the foregoing , only three copies are known to survive , and one of these is enshrined where collectors may covet in vain . ''

		It should be added , by the way , that X2 ,000 was the sum also paid for the lately discovered unique first quarto of '' Titus Andronicus , '' a fact which is duly noted in its place .

		The note on the
Ashbee	PERSON	facsimile quartos runs , '' Fifty copies produced , of which the editor destroyed nineteen to increase their scarcity . ''

		In the entries of books that bear but inci - dentally upon
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, many of the early allusions to the poet or his works are cited in full , and space is sometimes made for a liberal extract of less pertinent matter .

		Thus , under
Yates	PERSON	's ''
Castell	PERSON	of Courtesie '' -LRB- 1582 -RRB- are given the five stanzas of `` Verses written at the departure of his friend ,
W. S.	PERSON	, when hee went to dwell at
London	LOCATION	/ ' accompanied by the state - ment that the lines are unknown to Shake - speare 's biographers .

		As a matter of fact , they have merely been ignored because of the insuffi - cient evidence that they were addressed to the dramatist , a doubt which clouds the title of this book to inclusion in a Shakespeare bibliog - raphy .

		Nevertheless , we are glad to have the verses in this accessible place .

		The bibliographer has , very properly , not often attempted to pass upon the merits or demerits of any given publication .

		Such dis - tinction has been reserved especially , it would seem , for the works of Mr. -LRB- now Sir -RRB-
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		We are told , for instance , that his Intro - duction to the
Oxford Facsimile First Folio	ORGANIZATION	is '' disfigured by blunders and inaccuracies , '' and that the census of existing copies of the original '' by no means includes all . ''

		One is somewhat puzzled , too , to find Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's name , at each mention of it , enclosed in quotation marks ; 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, while Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's own publications will be found registered under the name of
Solomon Lazarus Levi the Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	name which he has him - self , no doubt wisely , long since discarded .

		Shall not some future D'Israeli record this among the amenities of literature ?

		There is a human quality in this great work which is refreshing : not often do we get a bibliography with blood in it .

		There is a felicitous touch in the dedication by
William Jaggard	PERSON	, bibliographer , to
William Jaggard	PERSON	, Elizabethan printer .

		And there is a very par - donable pride in the denomination of the
1623	DATE	Folio as the ''
Jaggard	PERSON	canon . ''

		The entire volume is to be commended not only for the completeness , clearness , and accuracy * which go to make it a model work of its kind , but also for that elusive element of fascination which in even the most pretentious literary works is so frequently sought in vain .

		It is not easy to imagine a more acceptable gift to the world of modern scholarship .

		* The only errors noted are trifling .

		On page 315 ,
Meikle	PERSON	- john 's '' Hamlet '' is misdated
1865	DATE	for

		There is no key-reference to the '' First Folio '' edition -LRB-
1906	DATE	-RRB- of Misses
Porter	PERSON	and
Clarke	PERSON	under Miss
Porter	PERSON	's name , though it may be found under Miss

		The edition itself is described only in the

		LEONARDO AND THE LADY .

		* When
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	relinquished the portrait which had stood on his easel , and on which he had worked from time to time for four years , it is said that he did not even then con - sider the work finished , and was not himself content with it .

		But that it more than con - tented all beholders this portrait of the wife of
Francesco del Giocondo	PERSON	is plain , since it was not long before it became celebrated throughout all
Italy	LOCATION	as the greatest masterpiece of portrai - ture that ever had been painted .

		Both as a work of art and as a pleasing likeness of the lady , it won universal praise .

		We hear nothing , how - ever , of any curiosity as to hidden meanings in the picture ; this began later .

		In course of time the portrait was purchased by
Francis I.	PERSON	, King of
France	LOCATION	, and eventually became the property of the
Louvre	LOCATION	, where it was called ''
Monna Lisa	PERSON	, '' and where until yesterday so to speak it remained , the *

		greatest treasure of the vast picture gallery .

		So wonderful was the treatment of the back - ground , so strong the impression of corporeality in the figure , that even to an untrained eye everything else in the Salon Carre where it hung , even pictures of the seventeenth century , seemed flat by comparison .

		Still greater than the spell of its technique , however , was the spell of the portrait 's personality .

		Even those who at first scoffed returned again and again , held by its mystery , impressed by its great repu - tation , puzzled , fascinated , disappointed some - times , but nevertheless lured back by the enigma of the face .

		What was the meaning of that elusive and enigmatic smile , those half - closed lids , that sphinx-like gaze , those folded hands ?

		Nothing in the history of the picture fur - nished any clue beyond the report of
Vasari	LOCATION	,
Leonardo	PERSON	's contemporary , that the artist `` sur - rounded his sitter with musicians , singers , and buffoons , to keep her in gentle gayety and thus avoid the melancholy aspect we observe in most portraits . ''

		Still less are there any revelations from the life of the lady , since all we actually know of it is her name and two dates :
Elisabetta Gherardini	PERSON	of
Naples	LOCATION	, married in
1495	DATE	to Fran - cesco del Giocondo of
Florence	LOCATION	-LRB- his third wife -RRB- , buried a little daughter in
1499	DATE	at
Santa Maria Novella	LOCATION	.

		To read between such scanty lines has ever been an attractive opening for the poet , the essayist , and the novelist ; hundreds of pens , writing in different languages , have offered almost as many differing impressions and opinions as there have been writers . ''

		I return to her in spite of myself , as the bird goes to the serpent , '' says
Michelet	PERSON	. ''

		Her smiling sweetness is as frightful as the Medusa , '' says
George Sand	PERSON	.

		`` A dream nurtured through a lifetime , '' says
Berenson	PERSON	.

		`` Her conquering smile expresses that wisdom of life that we have read already in the New Testament , ' Vanity of vanities , all is vanity , ' '' says
Kraus	PERSON	.

		Most eloquent of all , because written by one who was as thoroughly steeped in the spirit of the Italian Renaissance as it is possible for a nineteenth-century man to be , are the words of
Walter Pater	PERSON	.

		Everyone knows the passage , but it can not be too often quoted .

		`` All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form , the animalism of
Greece	LOCATION	, the lust of
Rome	LOCATION	, the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imagi - native loves , the return of the Pagan world , the sins of the Borgias .

Eastern	ORGANIZATION	merchants ; and , as
Leda	PERSON	, was mother of
Helen of Troy	ORGANIZATION	, and as Saint
Anne	PERSON	, the mother of
Mary	PERSON	; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes , and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments and tinged the eyelids and hands . ''

		But although we know so little of the life of the sitter for the picture , we know a great deal of the artist who painted it .

		We know that he was a man of remarkable personal beauty , grace , and accomplishments ; a musician and sculptor as well as painter ; an inventor and engineer ; that he had a passionate interest both in science and in mechanics , and believed that he had made a practical design for a flying-machine ; that he foreshadowed many important discov - eries , especially in geology ; that he was a won - derful mathematician , botanist , and anatomist .

		Yet so intent was he in exploring new paths , that notwithstanding his genius and industry throughout a life of sixty-seven years , his way was strewn with failures ; consequently , though his work that survives to-day is extremely bril - liant and epoch-making , it is comparatively small in quantity .

		We have , however , much more than the labors of his pencil and brush , or the record of his contemporaries , by which to make
Leonar	PERSON	- do 's acquaintance .

		He wrote a '' Treatise on Painting '' which has been translated into all languages and is regarded as an authority ; among his papers were found a series of note - books covering nearly the whole period of his active life .

		These were edited and published more than twenty-five years ago by
Richter	ORGANIZATION	, and are a veritable storehouse of information , so that we know the man 's attitude toward a great variety of subjects ; he seems alive although he has been so long dead .

		It is somewhat notable , however , that full as these note-books are in some ways , they never once allude either to the picture or the sketches of
Monna Lisa	PERSON	; they are silent also about contem - poraneous events , even to that one which must have created some stir in
Milan	LOCATION	while he was living there the discovery of
America	LOCATION	.

		That a personality so engaging as
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	, and a lady 's picture , the work of his hand , so mysterious as the
Monna Lisa	PERSON	, should attract the imagination of the novelist , was inevitable .

		To conjure up a love-affair between the artist and his sitter is a temptation not easily resisted ; and from time to time romances about them have been offered to the world .

		It occupies one division of
Merejkowski	ORGANIZATION	's volumi - nous Russian novel called '' The Resurrection of the Gods , '' republished in English as `` The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci . ''

		According to
Merejkowski	LOCATION	,
Leonardo	PERSON	never saw the lady except when she was sitting to him , and never alone then , except for one interview which proved to be the last .

		Yet they appeared to share some secret .

		It was not a love-secret , at least not in the ordinary sense of the term , but an inner comprehension of spirit by which each became daily more like the other ;
Monna Lisa	PERSON	in the studio became something other than the wife of the prosaic Giocondo rather , a phan - tom evoked by the will of the master , a female semblance of Leonardo himself , the sister and companion of his soul .

		Now comes a fresh work on the old theme , which doubtless attracts more attention than otherwise it would owing to the present excite - ment over the picture , and its disappearance from the
Louvre	LOCATION	.

		It is a work of 200 pages , and is called ''
Monna Lisa	PERSON	'' with a sub-title '' The Quest of the Woman-Soul . ''

		The author is an American writing under an Italian nom de plume .

		He adopts the favorite literary device of claiming the discovery of an old manuscript among some discarded rubbish .

		On examina - tion this proved to be a lost diary written by
Leonardo	PERSON	in his own hand in the year preceding his death .

		To guard against too great credulity on the part of the unwary , however , the pub - lisher has taken the precaution of adding a note to the title-page announcing that the work is one of '' pure fiction '' and that the author '' takes this method of sharing with the public the web of imagination woven for his own pleasure . ''

		The diary contains recollections of
Leonardo	LOCATION	's life at the time he was painting
Monna Lisa	PERSON	, with copies of certain letters which passed between them , and reflections upon the '' woman - soul '' in general , and how it was revealed to him through the personality of
Monna Lisa	PERSON	.

		There is an attempt , and a measurably successful one , to adopt the literary style of the period ; the author shows that he is well versed in all the available authorities ; the story moves along simply but swiftly , the climax being reached when each finds that the love of the spirit has become also the every-day love of man and woman for each other .

		This fact , startling to both , reveals itself on a certain moonlit night when they are alone together on the loggia of the Giocondo villa at
Vallombrosa	ORGANIZATION	.

		After a moment of mutual confession , they shrink from the revelation , the lady flees from her lover 's presence , and he departs from the house before 196 THE DIAL -LSB-

Francesco	PERSON	, the husband , with only a partial knowledge of the facts , seeks
Leonardo	PERSON	in his studio at
Florence	LOCATION	, armed with a dagger .

		Leonardo twists the weapon from his grasp , and after breaking the blade between his fingers hands back the fragments and bids
Francesco	PERSON	depart .

		Later , on that same day ,
Francesco	PERSON	becomes better informed , realizes that the house of the
Giocondi	PERSON	has been in no way dishonored , and returns to the studio about midnight , filled with shame and remorse and craving forgiveness .


Monna Lisa	PERSON	, whose health has been rapidly fail - ing , seems now near death , and sends by Fran - cesco a message calling Leonardo to her side in order that the three shall be once more united in friendship before she shall pass away .

		It is then , after this final interview , that Leonardo seeks to finish the picture standing on his easel , and to fix upon the canvas the look he had last seen upon the lady 's face .

		One whole day he works upon it , and then sees that he can do no more . ''

		The portrait was finished , as far as I or any mortal could carry it ; but it was still unfinished , in that it is impossible to portray the soul completely with material instruments directed by a mortal hand , '' he writes .

		These are almost the last words of the so-called '' diary . ''

		It is a pretty love-story , does no vio - lence to such facts as are known , and is so sane and sweet in tone that it can harm no one .

		But to give a convincing interpretation of
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	's inner mind would require an abler pen than is wielded by its author .

		PROBLEMS OF AN INCOME TAX .

		* There are few questions which return to men so frequently , and involve as many and as changeable reasons , social , political , and ethical , as taxation .

		It is a universal inquiry in all stages of civilization , both by those who con - sider human action as governed by principle and those who contemplate it chiefly as guided by selfish impulses .

		Nothing but ignorance and stupidity can bar one from this discussion .

		centre of conviction .

		A free-trader may think that nothing of moment can be said in favor of protective duties ; but these duties , once estab - lished , so modify the grounds of action as to make any material alteration injurious , at least for the time being .

		An error in taxation begins immediately to suit manufacture and commerce to itself , and thus to furnish arguments in its own support .

		It is only by an adventuresome spirit that these artificial reasons can be over - come , and effort be brought back to normal conditions .

		While justice is universal in its aims , it frequently calls for self-denial .

		This ever-returning discussion affords the best of ethical discipline ; we only find our way to correct action by a large amount of injudi - cious effort .

		Sound reasons are often the last to offer themselves .

		There is , however , a daily growth toward justice , and the general welfare is the only motive that never loses ground .

		While
the State	ORGANIZATION	starts in physical force , it is constantly learning to temper its claims by justice .

		The thoughts of men and the institu - tions of society grow together .

		While we never reach perfection , we are always on the road to it .

		Our burdens grow , but so does the strength which bears them .

		Few things are more indicative of a true civilization than just taxation .

		The present consideration of an in - come tax is a proof of progress .

		Inner insight in adjusting public burdens , and more power and patience in bearing them , are the most immediate evidences of progress .

		The two books before us are alike in form , though in fact quite diverse .

		They both start with definitions , give an account of the history of income taxation , and conclude with its rela - tions to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The first volume , '' The Income Tax , '' confines its sketches to a few leading nations , whose experience is the potent element in human history ; while the second volume , '' Income Taxation , '' includes the action of many comparatively unimportant peoples .

		It is a volume of reference , giving in a short space , with little labor on the part of the reader , the immediate facts associated with this form of taxation .

		The work of Professor
Seligman	PERSON	is much more elaborate , enabling the reader , though not without close and protracted attention , to grasp the present stage of growth as developed by the past mistakes and gains of men .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	has , during a consid - erable period , enjoyed an enviable reputation due to the thorough and luminous investiga - tions which he has brought to economic inquiries .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 The entire book is an empirical argument in favor of an income tax , supported by the expe - rience of men in working out the problems of welfare .

		The argument is strong both in theory and practice .

		The certainty with which every progressive nation is pushed up against this question of an income tax shows the powerful moral discipline to which men are subject .

		We may start with an indiscriminate capitation tax ; we may strive to make it more productive and more just by assessing different classes at a distinct rate ; we may move forward to a property tax and make our judgment more exact by an estimate of the products of each form of possession ; and , as commerce springs up , we may lay duties and excises as a convenient form of revenue .

		Last of all , taught by the lack of justice in all these methods , our thoughts may push on to an income tax as the embodiment of a more ideal system , in which each man knows what he re - ceives from society , what he owes to it , and how he can best escape tyranny .

		To establish a progressive income tax has a certain show of fairness , but hardly its very substance .

		It is an open road to confiscation .

		It is suffi - cient to prevent the acquisition of wealth by unfair means , leaving it , when once acquired , under common claims by the public .

		We should , as far as possible , reach an equality of obliga - tion , which is the great merit of a well admin - istered income tax .

		It is right that small resources should receive abatement , as thus only can the poor maintain an independent footing .

		It is also just that an income which arises from labor should be differentiated from one which comes from fixed resources , since it does not give the same permanent power .

		Simple justice , resting on a few and plain dis - tinctions , should be the characteristic of tax - ation .

		There are two questions associated with taxes .

		Does the tax itself escape mere greed ?

		And is the community prepared to accept it and give it a fair application ?

		The one question is answered by sound economic principles , and the other by the ethical temper of those whom it concerns .

		These questions may involve very different considerations .

		The one concerns in - trinsic fitness ; the other , the current feeling in a given community .

		The one is a scientific ques - tion , and the other pertains to the stage of development in social and national life .

		We have the feeling that Professor
Seligman	PERSON	gives rather undue weight to the inquiry as to what men will bear .

		While this can not be advan - tageously overlooked , neither can the inquiry of intrinsic fitness be lightly set aside by it .

		Only as the ideal is magnified can any existing method be overcome and the laws of economic and ethical action gain the front .

		What are some - times regarded as the laws of Political Economy are nothing more than an equilibrium set up between faulty methods and selfish feelings .

		In criminology , we have to consider the crimi - nal temper , while we bring to it higher mo - tives .

		Yet the ethical idea must have fair play , if we are to displace with it the perverted tendency .

		Sooner or later , the ideal motive must arise and crowd out all lower considerations .

		It thus becomes impossible , at least for the theoretical mind , to accept the true goal of taxation and not use it as a counter-weight to conventional opinion .

		If , as a fact , it gains a somewhat faJse brilliancy , it is still the accepted method of the idealist which he can neither forget himself nor allow others to forget .

		An entirely satisfactory mode of taxation , or , indeed , of any human action , is impossible ; but this does not render unfitting an effort to approach it .

		If a man of a miserly disposition , if one of simply good business habits , and one easy-going , have the same income , we would lay upon them the same burdens , in each case fitting because ideally just , and then leave them each to work out his own problem .

		This is an ideal use of an ideal solution , though the individual friction may be quite different .

		The circumstances and disposi - tions of men are very diverse , and we only take them into consideration when we can not neglect them or overcome them .

		Men can not wear like coats , but we give this fact only a qualified con - sideration when insisting that they shall all wear some coat .

		The most perfect tax may still be a burden ; but we do not allow this relation to get into the foreground except when we can not help it .

		The ideal character of any given method must be dwelt on and allowed all the weight we can attach to it .

		Whatever the color of a man 's eyes , he is still a man , and must be called on to deal with manly motives as far as possible .

		When a great variety of diverse considerations are bearing on men 's minds , we have especial occasion to dwell on the best of these motives , and give ground only under compulsion .

		The thing which surprises one in the discus - sion of income taxes is the violence of the ideas and of the language employed , even by those whom we regard as good men .

		The true quality 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, of the rational mind seems to be lost , and to be replaced by notions which have conventional currency .

		We suppose that this confusion comes from the practical difficulties and the mistakes which arise among men in their efforts to adjust themselves to each other .

		The inquisitorial character which attaches to the inquiries into income has been urged with great bitterness , when these very inquisitions are made necessary by the unwillingness of men to meet their obli - gations .

		If men were accustomed to be upright , this difficulty would disappear .

		A chief excel - lence of the English method is found in an evasion of this objection by dealing with those from whom the income comes , rather than with those who receive it .

		Men are so ruled by cus - tom as to render it , rather than intrinsic fitness , the guide of action .

		We might conceive of a dialogue between the mole and the horticulturist to this effect : `` Why this constant secrecy , these covered passages , noiseless motion , and numerous subterfuges ?

		Come out into the open , and let us have a fair fight . ''

		The mole , confi - dent in its own methods , might respond , '' Ha , ha !

		That would be a notable piece of candor . ''

		Most men develop their thoughts on the plane of custom and not on that of intrinsic righteous - ness .

		They accept the law of the Medes and Persians , which changeth not .

		Custom is in - deed our chief bond of unity , and as such can - not be lightly dealt with ; but no rational man will accept it as the last and highest standard of conduct .

		While one can not grow an inch in a day , it does not follow that he can not grow at all .

		We accept the authority of what is , but preeminently the rightfulness of what should be ; we blend them as best we can .

		The sense of the incongruity of human action only makes us the more farsighted .

		All improvement mili - tates against some feelings , but does not thereby lose its authority .

		Duties and excises based on consumption trespass on the resources of the poor , already too limited .

		An income tax , press - ing lightly on inadequate means , falls as a duty on those best able to meet it , and thus concurs with the eternal fitness of things .

		The goal is national as well as individual , and when we have fairly caught sight of it the blood should be stirred and the pace quickened .

		One can no more be driven by expediency simply , in national than in individual growth .

		The long and the short stretches of life are both under a double law .

		To feel those laws and obey them is the highest national , as it is the most perfect individual , wisdom .

		MEMOIRS OF AX UNHAPPY PRESIDENT .

		* Fifty years have passed since
James Bu	PERSON	- chanan , retiring from the four unhappy years of his presidency , brought to a close a long and industrious political career .

		A sincere believer in old-school doctrines of strict construction , and honestly intent upon compromise and peace , he bore with him to private life the bitterest criticism of the inefficiency of his acts and the insincerity of his motives , and was objurgated both by the North and by the South which he had so vainly tried to hold together .

		Deeply persuaded of the rectitude of his course in this as in former parts of his public life , he prepared in his retirement an extended defence of his ad - ministration , which he published in
1866	DATE	with the title '' Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	's Administration on the Eve of the Rebellion . ''

		Some years later , his voluminous private papers were used by Mr.
George Ticknor Curtis	PERSON	in the preparation of a biography which was published in two large volumes in
1883	DATE	.

		In
1895	DATE	appeared a volume of essays under the title '' Turning on the Light : A Dispassionate Survey of President
Buchanan	PERSON	's
Administration	ORGANIZATION	from
1860	DATE	to its Close . ''

		This was written by
Horatio King	PERSON	, who was assistant postmaster-general under
Buchanan	PERSON	, and became acting postmaster-general when Mr.
Holt	PERSON	was appointed Secretary of War .

		But neither this , nor
Curtis	PERSON	's able work , nor
Buchanan	PERSON	's own apologia , has done much to relieve the unfor - tunate President from the severe judgment of historians as to the weakness of his course in the years before the Civil War .

		One finds the strictures of Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	only a little less severe than those of von Hoist ; to Professor
Hart	PERSON	it is still '' the profligate admin - istration of Buchanan '' ; while Admiral
Chad	PERSON	- wick writes of '' the lawyer wrapped in the technicalities of his profession , with a character developed into the softness which comes with continued success , chiefly the result of encounter - ing no obstacles ; ... the mediocre politician , a being who always seeks to work on the line of the least resistance . ''

		Possibly destined to be the foundation for a more successful defence of
Buchanan	PERSON	's policy as President , and certainly to be the basis of all future accounts of his career , there now comes from the press , in twelve handsome octavo vol - umes , a splendid edition of the '' Works of
James Buchanan	PERSON	. ''

		In the Introduction , the * THE WORKS OF
JAMES BUCHANAN	PERSON	.

		Edited , with an Introduction , by
John Bassett Moore	PERSON	.

		In twelve volumes .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	: The
J. B. Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 199 editor , Professor
John Bassett Moore	PERSON	, explains that it is to the devotion of Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	's niece , Mrs.
Henry E. Johnston	PERSON	-LRB- formerly Miss
Harriet Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , that this series is due .

		For the docu - ments which fill the twelve volumes the editor has drawn upon the
Buchanan	PERSON	papers now de - posited with the
Historical Society of Pennsyl	ORGANIZATION	- vania ; upon
Curtis	PERSON	's biography , which contains some writings missing from the manuscript collection ; upon the '' Annals of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' the '' Register of Debates , '' and the ''
Congres	PERSON	- sional Globe '' ; upon the executive and diplo - matic archives of the
United States	LOCATION	, with which Professor
Moore	PERSON	's life-work has given him an intimacy most valuable for the task in hand ; and upon various manuscript collections chiefly in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, such as the Polk , the
Jackson	PERSON	, the
Van Buren	PERSON	, and the Holt cor - respondence .

		For
Buchanan	PERSON	's congressional career , Pro- fessor
Moore	PERSON	has reprinted a judicious selection of his speeches ; but a detailed synopsis makes it easy to refer to the congressional documents .

		In presenting
Buchanan	PERSON	's letters and state papers , the editor frequently prints letters or extracts of letters from other sources which serve to throw light on the text .

		A most con - spicuous instance of this is found in connection with the famous reference in
Buchanan	PERSON	's inau - gural address to the expected decision in the case of Dred
Scott	PERSON	.

		Professor
Moore	PERSON	prints -LRB- vol .

		x. , pp. 106-108 -RRB- a letter from
Associate Justice Catron	ORGANIZATION	and one from
Associate Justice Grier	ORGANIZATION	, which indeed show that there was a confidential correspondence with the President - Elect prior to the decision , but also point to the conclusion that the determination to enter into the whole question of slavery in the territories was not due to the wish of
Associate Justice Wayne	ORGANIZATION	, but was rather chargeable to the minority of the court to
Associate Justices McLean	ORGANIZATION	and
Curtis	PERSON	.

		Throughout the work , Professor
Moore	PERSON	for the most part expresses his own views very rarely , contenting himself with a helpful note here and there .

		Often he has to call the read - er 's attention to some omission or mistake in the reprinting of a document which he has found in
Curtis	LOCATION	's life of
Buchanan	LOCATION	.

		Into the last volume of the work he has gathered the bio - graphical material concerning
Buchanan	PERSON	, the President 's own account of his administration ; an earlier autobiography ; and a sketch by
Buchanan	PERSON	's nephew ,
J. Buchanan Henry	PERSON	.

		To these , Professor
Moore	PERSON	has added a discourse upon ' '
Buchanan	PERSON	's Administration on the Eve of the Rebellion , '' read in
January , 1908	DATE	, before the Cliosophic Society of
Lancaster	LOCATION	,
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania , by the Honorable
W. U. Hensel	PERSON	.

		This Professor
Moore	PERSON	considers an able address .

		Finally , besides devoting some words of appre - ciation to the positive side of
Buchanan	PERSON	's career his `` laborious industry , '' his `` capacity for business , '' and his rehabilitation of the work of the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	he finds room in his Introduction to criticize the harsh judgment of
Buchanan	LOCATION	, which , as we have suggested in the beginning of this review , has been his fate at the hands of American historians .

		The work is made the more helpful by an unusually excel - lent index .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* `` The Winning of
Barbara Worth	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	, is a story of the Southwestern desert , of a sunken basin called
La Palma de la Mano di Dios	ORGANIZATION	, skirted by the
Colorado River	LOCATION	, but separated by a barrier from its life-giving waters .

		It is a story of Reclamation and Good Business -LRB- the capitals are the author 's -RRB- , written by an enthusiast who has also a sense of the dramatic human values of such a theme .

		On the business side , it tells of a titanic struggle with nature , in which an astute individual triumphs over a conscienceless corpora - tion ; on the romantic side , it tells of the making of a man out of an engineer , and of his reward in win - ning the love of the heroine .

		Barbara is a child found in the desert after her parents have perished in a sand-storm , and adopted by the astute individual above mentioned .

		She grows up a true child of the desert , loving its mystery , but eagerly interested in the effort to reclaim it for human use .

		200 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, mighty task is accomplished , it is only fitting that she should become the wife of the engineer whose qualities of finer manhood the work has developed .

		Incidentally , the secret of her parentage is at last revealed , and it proves the means of reconciling her adoptive father with the head of the corporation which had heen his unscrupulous foe until nature took a hand in the game and justified Worth 's far - seeing plan .

		The story has a great deal of character - interest , and of the interest that goes with tense situations and the solving of difficult problems .

		Its materials have been used many times before , but they are made to seem almost fresh by the large - ness of their treatment .

		Still , the descriptive parts seem to us overdone , and the engineering situation , although described in great detail , and even illus - trated by a map , makes too heavy a demand upon what understanding the average reader of novels may be presumed to possess .

		The style of the book is matter-of-fact , and without any sort of distinction .

		But in spite of its long-windedness , and of the stretches which rival its own desert in aridity , the story is not unmoving or unsatisfying , and we can see in it many of the elements of popularity .

		A sickening condition of political corruption and misrule , against which war is waged single-handed by a stout fighter for civil decency , is the frame - work of '' His Rise to Power , '' by Mr.
Henry Russell Miller	PERSON	.

		It has become a favorite theme of the American novelist , and is , in fact , our modern ver - sion of all the dragon-myths of ancient legend .

		A town in western
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is the place of action .

		The hero is a reformer who is elected to the office of district attorney , and makes himself a terror to evil-doers .

		The local magnate has a daughter with whom the hero falls in love .

		Presently , it becomes his official duty to expose the rascalities of the mag - nate ; but the plea of love weakens him , and he hushes the matter up .

		Also , when the popular agi - tation for reform subsides , he finds himself without a following , for the fickle public has no lasting use for such an idealist .

		But the governorship tempts him , and he finds it within his reach if he will but make terms with the machine .

		Again he weakens , and salves his conscience with the specious old plea which has so often made the angels weep .

		He will accept corruption as a means to an end , in the fatuous belief that his purity of ultimate purpose can pass through the fire unscathed , and that the larger good which he hopes to accomplish will justify his temporary treason to principle .

		It is a shocking moral , but one to which many actual examples give point .

		The line of conduct here indicated finds many defenders , and those who scorn it are de - nounced as `` unpractical , '' but there is little hope for the body politic when its ills are sought to be cured by practitioners whose own moral sense is thus blunted .

		In the present case , we are led to believe that the hero is strong enough to stand his ground , and clear-sighted enough to see that lasting good can not
spring	DATE	from the soil of evil ; this makes his final defection particularly deplorable , and creates a contradiction in his character that exceeds the limitations of the novelist 's warrant .

		The cat is named
Gladys	PERSON	.

		A name less aristo - cratic would hardly be in keeping , since the book in which pussy plays her part is a novel by Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	.

		It is a novel written through - out in a high artificial key the key of '' society '' in its fine flower of sophistication , affected by an artistic interest .

		Whether in the drawing-room or the studio , its characters invariably converse by means of a slangy sort of banter , and their superi - ority to the common herd is implicit in every phrase of these verbal encounters .

		Their talk is intermin - able , and all of it is spiced with a kind of wit which might be amusing in occasional flashes , but becomes intensely wearisome as a continuous display .

		When something like seriousness is aimed at , we get fine - spun sentiment and moral quibbling .

		In short , the book keeps us in a hot-house atmosphere which leaves us gasping for a breath of fresh air .

		The story is simple enough ; a girl poses for a painter as his model , and presently the two find themselves ultra-romantically in love .

		But the painter has the bluest of blood in his veins , and the members of his family are horrified at the thought of his marrying such a person .

		The young woman then suggests that marriage is only a convention , and says that for her part she is quite willing to dispense with it .

		Whereupon the man comes out strong as a pattern of noble high-mindedness , and will have none of the proffered sacrifice .

		Finally , the family is won over by the appealing charm of the young woman , and the event is as moral as any one could wish .

		Strip - ped of its trappings , the story is thus seen to be of the most commonplace , and the trappings are them - selves mainly meretricious .

		It takes more than five hundred pages to deal with this complication , and they are entitled `` The Common Law , '' which means just the law of social decency in the rela - tions between men and women .

		The author does much skating on thin ice before this safe conclusion is reached , and the skating is the raison d'etre of the whole affair .

		From
Alaska	LOCATION	to
Panama	LOCATION	is a jump , but we are glad that Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	has taken it , for his story of '' The Ne'er - do-well '' who made good in the
Canal Zone	ORGANIZATION	is far and away the best novel that he has thus far written .

		Young
Kirk Anthony	PERSON	does not promise well for a hero at the start .

		He is a '' star of the gridiron , '' and his reckless conduct has caused his father -LRB- the railway magnate -RRB- to give him up as hopeless .

		We first meet him as the central figure of a drunken orgy in the Tenderloin , in which he becomes almost guilty of murder .

		He is rescued from this scrape by being drugged and having his pockets picked , after which he is shanghaied on a steamer sailing for the Isthmus .

		He wakes up on board , the next day , to discover that he has not a cent to his name , and that his only asset is a prepaid transportation ticket .

		Even this is made out in another name , which is in turn the alias of a fugitive embezzler .

		Here is a des -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 201 perate situation indeed , and when he lands his troubles are only beginning .

		The American consul at first befriends him , and takes him at his word ; but soon grows distrustful , and turns him upon the street .

		He then gets into a scrimmage with the authorities , and acquires an inside acquaintance with a Spanish prison .

		From this plight he is rescued by the American minister 's wife , who is really the power behind the diplomatic throne , and has already befriended him on the voyage .

		Through her influence he gets a position on the railway , and is rapidly advanced .

		Being of railway extraction , he takes to the work like a duck to water , and for the first time in his life becomes a useful member of society .

		But the woman who has befriended him is also indiscreet enough to fell in love with him a fact of which he remains unsuspecting until she has fairly thrown herself at his head .

		His one indis - cretion in this quarter is limited to a single impul - sive kiss , of which he is heartily ashamed .

		Mean - while , he falls head over heels in love with a fascin - ating damsel , the daughter of one of the proudest Spanish families of the Isthmus .

		After this , the excitement grows fast and furious .

		He weds the damsel almost under her father 's nose ; then the diplomat , insanely jealous , accuses him of a fault of which the boy is wholly guiltless , and afterwards takes his own life .

		Then
Kirk	PERSON	is held as an alleged murderer , and a sleuth from the States appears to arrest him for embezzlement .

		Finally , the father appears on the scene , and there is a great clearing - up .

		There is a good deal of humor in the tale , and of a sort that we had not supposed within the author 's reach .

		This is particularly displayed in the antics and speech of one
Ramon Alfarez	PERSON	, the hero 's persecutor and rival , and in the doings of the Jamaican negro with a Scotch-cockney dialect who attaches himself to
Kirk	PERSON	's fortunes with dog-like devotion .

		As a breezy , animated , romantic yarn , this book would be hard to beat ; and not the least of its charms is its irrepressible boyishness .

		The most threadbare of themes , which will never - theless keep its vitality as long as novels are written about men and women , once more engages our atten - tion in Miss
Fannie Heaslip Lea	ORGANIZATION	's '' Quicksand . ''

		A young woman with a temperament marries a man without one .

		For a time his simple sincerity and downright manliness hold her affections ; but she at last becomes vaguely conscious of a void in her life .

		This is by way of being filled when a young man who also has a temperament appears upon the scene .

		The dally ings of these two under the pretence of friendship soon create the familiar triangular situ - ation , and the crisis is brought about by the ancient device of a storm , from which the heroine takes refuge in a mountain cabin opportunely occupied by the hero .

		They arrange to take flight together , when the bullet of a feudist tragically solves the problem by ending the hero 's life , and incidentally making a sort of real hero out of him ; for the bullet which he intercepts is aimed at his friend , the hus - band whom he has plotted to betray .

		The latter never learns how near his happiness has come to shipwreck , and the wife expiates her sinful intention by bearing in secret the burden of her guilt .

		All this takes place among the mountains of
Virginia	LOCATION	, in a community whose inhabitants are mostly gossips keen upon scandal-mongering .

		The novel would hardly be worth noticing were it not told with a rather exceptional grace of manner and a skill in both invention and characterization .

		Ethically , it comes dangerously close to the border-line in its enlistment of the reader 's sympathies with the clan - destine romance of the two lovers .

		A village somewhere in the
State of New York	LOCATION	is the scene of Mrs.
Fremont Older	PERSON	's ''
Esther Damon	PERSON	. ''

		The heroine is the daughter of a Methodist zealot who represents a type which was not uncommon forty or fifty years ago , and which probably still survives in remote countryside localities .

		Esther chafes under the artificial restraints imposed upon her in the name of religion , and her rebellious blood leads her into the fatal course of a secret love affair with the worthless son of the village saloon-keeper .

		When the consequences of her error are made mani - fest , she is driven from home by her outraged parents , and becomes a social outcast .

		The hero of the novel is
Robert Orme	PERSON	, a man of artistic nature , a gentle - man by instinct and breeding , who is driven by the nagging of his colorless and conventional wife to desperation and drink .

		When their house has been sold over their head , and
Orme	PERSON	lies drunken in the gutter , his wife leaves him , and he also becomes a village outcast .

		The story is mainly concerned with the process of his self-reform and gradual restora - tion to dignity and self-respect , with the growth of his love for
Esther	PERSON	and their mutual avowals , and with her act of renunciation , decided upon in the excitement of an evangelistic revival , which sends her to the
New Hebrides	ORGANIZATION	as a missionary .

		This is the real denouement of the action , although upon a closing page we are told that
Esther	PERSON	returns after many years and finds
Orme	PERSON	waiting for her .

		The story is vividly told , and has a sort of crude power .

		It offers , moreover , what we take to be a faithful delineation of the modes of social and religious thinking that were characteristic of many of our rural communities a generation ago .

		In the latter part of the fifteenth century , the island of
Cyprus	LOCATION	was a prize coveted by many powers .

		Its King
Janus	ORGANIZATION	, of the house of
Lusignan	PERSON	, had dislodged the Genoese , and placed himself under the protection of the Sultan of
Egypt	LOCATION	, thereby incurring the displeasure of the Holy Father at
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The right of
Janus	ORGANIZATION	was disputed by his sister
Carlotta	ORGANIZATION	, and in this factional strife other powers saw their opportunity .

		Naples intrigued against the ruler , and
Venice	LOCATION	sought to attach him to her interests .

		The latter gained her end by con - tracting for him an alliance with
Caterina Cornaro	PERSON	, the daughter of one of her most patrician houses .

		It is the story of this ill-fated girl-queen that Mrs.
Lawrence Turnbull	PERSON	gives in `` The Royal Pawn of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' a historical romance far out of the common 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, in its solidity of foundation and skill of craftsman - ship .

		Beginning with the embassy which proposes the alliance to the
Signoria	LOCATION	, the story continues with a brilliant account of the nuptials , followed by an account of the brief wedded life of the new Queen of
Cyprus	LOCATION	.

		Then comes the tragic death of
Janus	ORGANIZATION	, the birth of their child , the nefarious seizure of the child by the
Council	ORGANIZATION	in the pay of
Naples	LOCATION	, the concessions extorted by terror from the frantic mother , the rally of her defenders , the child 's death , and the gift of
Cyprus	LOCATION	to
Venice	LOCATION	by the bereaved mother , who is perplexed in the extreme by the conflict between love for her adopted country and the plea of her Venetian patriotism .

		In all this varied history , she is indeed a pawn moved upon the diplomatic board by powers beyond her control .

		What is more to the point from the artistic standpoint is the fact that she is pictured for us with a penetrative sympathy that makes of her much more than a puppet nothing less than a real woman of pure and exalted ideals , whose tragic destiny we may not contemplate unmoved .

		This sincere and graceful romance seems to us much the best piece of work that Mrs.
Turnbull	PERSON	has thus far produced .

		The horror in which
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sentiment holds any mingling of the blood of whites and negroes , or even any sort of association that implies social equality , has been the motive of many novels .

		They are unpleasant novels , because their theme is essen - tially repellant ; and
Miss Virginia Demarest	PERSON	's '' Nobody 's '' would offer no exception were we not made to surmise before reading very far that the beautiful and sensitive heroine , who suffers untold agonies because she is reputed to have a trace of black tincture in her veins , is really of the purest white extraction , and quite legitimately the object of the hero 's devotion .

		The explanation of how the horrible misunderstanding comes about takes us far back into the past .

		A feud between two families , a love-affair between the son of one and the daughter of the other , the man 's death in a duel before he has had time to make legal reparation for the wrong done the woman , the birth of a girl child , and the mother 's dying effort to save her name by having it believed that this child is the illegitimate offspring of her faithful -LRB- partly-colored -RRB- nurse , these are the elements of the tragic complication which blights the girl 's life when she grows to womanhood .

		It takes a hero from
New York	LOCATION	, visiting his sister in her
Tennessee	LOCATION	home , to discover the trail of the truth , and , moved by his love for the girl , to clear away the mystery and free her from the curse .

		The truth is so apparent , after we have been given one or two hints , that it strains our credulity to assume that no one but the hero has any suspicion of it ; and this is the chief structural defect of the novel .

		Otherwise the story develops logically , is rich in inci - dent and dramatic situation , and romantic enough in feeling to satisfy the youngest mind .

		It has no psychology worth mentioning , but it has a good deal of superficial charm .

		Welcome in any case , and doubly welcome because of its appearance in the dullest season of the publish - ing year , is '' The Glory of
Clementina	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	.

		It is not so much of the ingenu - ity of his invention , although this is out of the com - mon , that Mr.
Locke	PERSON	allures us , as it is by the whimsicality of his style and its rich allusiveness .

		His later books have a charm and a degree of finish that delight the cultivated sense ; they exhibit a familiarity with the world of ideas that makes them singularly acceptable to the cultivated intelligence .

		The scholarship with which they are invested is too lightly worn to be oppressive , and they fairly sparkle with humor albeit a humor of dry and even sar - donic type .

		Their conversations are not too brilliant to be natural , their reflective passages are crammed with suggestiveness , and their characters , sometimes quaint almost to the point of caricature , finally force themselves upon our acceptance on their own terms .


Clementina	PERSON	, for example , the woman who has sought refuge in art for the blighted romance of her girlhood , who has become famous and eccen - tric at the same time , whose bluntness of speech matches the roughness of her exterior , is a true woman at heart , and the author compels her accept - ance as such after he has done everything in his power to make it seemingly impossible .

		It is an artistic tour de force which transforms the harsh and dowdy creature of his opening chapters into the splendid figure who adorns the closing pages .

		For it is
Clementina	PERSON	's `` glory '' to yield at last to the instincts of essential womanhood , and give free play to the emotions which she had thought were dead within her .

		The partner in her
St. Martin 's Summer	ORGANIZATION	romance is Dr.
Quixtus	PERSON	, a dear , dessicated soul , an anthropologist of European fame , to whom his science seems to be all that is needed for a completely satisfactory existence .

		He , too , has his awakening , and it is brought about by a singular device .

		By nature the kindliest of men , doing good in many unostentatious ways , he is sud - denly embittered by a series of discoveries which reveal to him some of the mean and malignant aspects of human nature .

		As one shock succeeds another , his faith in his fellow-man gives way , and he is turned into the most desperate of cynics .

		He determines , moreover , not to remain passive under the revelation , but to embark upon a career of the most diabolical wickedness , and sets about devising subtle schemes for making other people miserable .

		The madness runs its course until it is cured by its own excess , and certain discoveries of unexpected goodness restore his lost faith in mankind .

		It is the situation of
Labiche	PERSON	's familiar farce , elaborated .

		Several years ago , Mr.
William Romaine Pater	PERSON	- son , writing under the name of ''
Benjamin Swift	PERSON	, '' produced a number of novels incisive in their char - acterization , which left an acrid taste .

		After a con - siderable interval of silence , he now gives us `` The Old Dance Master , '' which shows him in a new light .

		The years have mellowed him , making him a more human and lovable writer than the caustic
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 satirist we once knew .

		He tells us that the new book '' simply grew during three years in a mind that was busy with different , very different things .

		Out of a chaos and phantasmagoria of characters , impressions , suggestions , there gradually began to emerge the face and figure of a pleasant old man , one Habenichts , who had been buffeted but not vanquished by Fortune . ''

		The creative process thus outlined was happy in its issue , for Habenichts finds his way straight to our affections , and his story is simply a fairy tale of real life .


Sam Larkin	PERSON	's cab - yard is the starting point of this joyous romantic development , and
Jellini 's Dancing Academy	ORGANIZATION	in
Tottenham Court Road	LOCATION	is at the focus of interest .

		Jellini is only a name , for the institution is managed by Habenichts , a decayed Viennese gentleman whose hobby is the dance , of which he has published a ponderous history in twelve unread volumes .

		He wins for his academy the distinguished patronage of Sir
John Marduke	PERSON	, an aristocrat of exaggerated philanthropical tendencies , who in an unguarded moment persuades his son
Monty Marduke	PERSON	to accom - pany him to a pupil 's reception .

		Monty goes reluc - tantly , gets sight of the lovely
Dorothy Larkin	PERSON	, and is done for .

		To his father 's horror , he insists upon making the young woman 's acquaintance , dancing with her , attaching himself to her for the rest of the evening , and escorting her to her cab-yard home .

		Except for a few stormy minutes a day or two later , he does not see her again for nearly two years , but he is determined to make her his wife , and does .

		It turns out that
Dorothy	PERSON	is not a Larkin at all , but the illegitimate offspring of the late Earl of Swaffham , and the first thing is to rescue her from her step-father , her two dragon-aunts , and the amor - ous cabby who sighs for her love .

		This is done with the connivance of Habenichts , who puts her in the care of her aunt , the
Duchess of Berkshire	ORGANIZATION	, greatly astonished to learn that she has a niece .

		Her new guardian proves sterner than the aunts of the cab-yard , and
Monty	ORGANIZATION	is kept languishing for a sight of Dorothy until she has been put through a long course of educational sprouts .

		Since this is all a fairy tale , Monty remains determined and faithful , getting his reward in the end .

		Meanwhile , Sir
John	PERSON	is put under restraint before he has had time to squander the whole of his fortune , and
Monty	ORGANIZATION	is able to bestow ample largess upon the old dance master to whom he owes his happiness .

		Then Habenichts turns out to be a Baron of the
Austrian Empire	ORGANIZATION	, which discovery gets him into the good graces of the
Duchess of Berkshire	ORGANIZATION	, and leads to complications only hinted at in the present volume , but which the author half promises to make the subject of a second novel .

		We shall eagerly await this sequel , for Habenichts is the best of company , and only regret that we are unlikely to have further acquaintance with his fellow-boarders in Mrs.
Wix	PERSON	's Residential Hotel , or with the disappointed cabby , or with
Larkin	PERSON	and his redoubtable sisters .

		These `` low life '' types are worthy of
Dickens	LOCATION	, and give occasion for many of Mr.
Paterson	PERSON	's most animated and picturesque pages .

		In `` Drender 's Daughter '' Miss
Netta Syrett	PERSON	has given us a surprisingly good novel , and considerably surpassed her previous work .

		It abounds in life , it is strong and convincing in its analysis of character , and its interest is sustained at a high level through - out .

		In a certain sense , it is a novel with a thesis ; but this is developed naturally and unobtrusively , so as not to clog the action .

		The one noticeable defect of the work is its constant belittling of the social reformer , who is by no means always the cold - blooded and priggish sort of person here described for us in the character of
Leonard Chetwynd	ORGANIZATION	.

		This man , who has great wealth , and a desire for social usefulness which exceeds his capacity , establishes a model colony upon his estate , and engages in many other uplifting enterprises of the kind that are made futile because they do not take human nature suffi - ciently into account .

		His chief experiment , as far as the human interest of the novel is concerned , is performed upon the girl whom he takes as a child from the family of one of his tenants with the purpose of making her his wife when she shall have been reared in accordance with his ideas .

		It is a '' Sandfoi d and Merton '' experiment , and naturally goes awry .

		To begin with , the girl is not of the hardy peasant stock that he had thought her to be , but the illegitimate offspring of a man of his own social class .

		She inherits her father 's qualities , and develops the artistic temperament .

		Nevertheless , the plan of her guardian is consum - mated , and she becomes his wife .

		In the course of time , she discovers her father , and falls in love with an old-time playmate .

		Finally , the tangle is straight - ened out by
Chetwynd	LOCATION	, who finds a mate of his own kind , and defies the conventions by eloping with her .

		This suits the plans of the young people , who had been upon the point of doing the same thing , and clears the way for their legal union .

		The story thus seriously outlined is enlivened by a good deal of delicate comedy , and is written in a flexible style which proves equal to the varied demands made upon it .

		Miss
Wylie	PERSON	's '' Dividing Waters '' is an inter - national novel of a kind that is less frequently met with than it was some years ago .

		In this case , the marriage is contracted between an English girl and a German army officer .

		The heroine is the high - strung daughter of a clergyman , and she rejects the offer of her steadfast English lover in favor of the more romantic German wooer .

		She has , however , in a moment of weakness , impelled by a quixotic notion of renunciation , given the former to under - stand that she would be his wife , and although the pledge is promptly taken back -LRB- by letter -RRB- its with - drawal fails to reach her suitor , who is in the wilds of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		When he returns to claim his bride , he finds her married , and the fact that she has failed to tell her husband about the entanglement leads to complications .

		Particularly does this concealment 204 THE -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, clash with the German standards of honor ; and this is not the only conflict that comes from the union , for the girl can not fit herself into the life of an alien people , and the glamour of her romance wears off as she discovers that her new existence must be led under narrowly restricted conditions both as to material comfort and social environment .

		Then comes the war scare , and she is fairly distracted between the claims of her English patriotism and the new German allegiance to which her husband con - siders her bound .

		The climax comes when , believing a declaration of war imminent , she hurriedly flees from
Berlin	LOCATION	to take refuge in her English home , just at the moment when her husband -LRB- although the fact is unknown to her -RRB- is to fight a duel in defence of the honor which her indiscreet conduct has seemed to impugn .

		He is dangerously wounded , and when she learns of his condition , she hastens to his side , like a modern Isolde , just in time to save his life .

		She retains our sympathy , although she acts foolishly at times , because her love emerges strengthened from its trials .

		Both the husband and the discarded but faithful lover are almost too superhuman in their goodness to be true , and the writer has not escaped the peril of over-sentimentality .

		She tries to hold the scales fairly in her comparison between German and English standards and ways of living , and is evidently much impressed by the German ideal of duty to the nation as paramount to all the claims of personal interest .

		In fact , she seems to be making a covert plea to her fellow-countryman to adopt the continental policy of militarism , and in this the book must be reckoned as mischievous .

		Its pages contain a good deal of slovenly writing ; and the writer 's German is very shaky , to judge from the number of mistakes which are found in the simple expressions with which her novel is peppered .

MORTON PAYNK	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Folk-lore in modern
Greece	LOCATION	.

		It is a genuine pleasure to welcome such a book as '' Modern Greek Folk - lore and Ancient Greek Religion , '' written by Mr.
John Cuthbert Lawson	PERSON	and published by the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Not only does it give the first adequate English treat - ment of the subjects implied by the former half of the title -LRB- for which we have had to go to
Bernhardt Schmidt	PERSON	and Poletes -RRB- ; it also represents the work of a pioneer `` in attempting on a generous scale to exhibit modern Greek folklore as an essential factor in the interpretation of ancient Greek religion . ''

		How strongly this latter aspect of his work appealed to our author may be seen in his conclusion that '' the oral tradition of a people who have instinct - ively clung to every ancient belief and custom is , even after more than two thousand years , a safer guide than the contemporary writings of men who deliberately discarded or arbitrarily modified tradi - tion in favour of the results of their own personal speculations .

		First , then , the peasants of modern
Greece	LOCATION	must furnish our clue to the popular beliefs of antiquity ; afterwards we may profitably consider the use and handling of those beliefs in ancient literature . ''

		Mr.
Lawson	PERSON	spent two years in
Greece	LOCATION	-LRB- 1898-1900 -RRB- , and one must envy him his initial researches even as one congratulates him on their outcome .

		In every nook and cranny of
Greece	LOCATION	, from muleteers and boatmen , from priests and peasants , from '
Demetris	PERSON	and Constantines and rare ana - chronistic Epaminondases , '' he gathered humble but invaluable material .

		Over this and the literary sources he labored for about ten years , and the book bears evidence alike of the richness of the author 's material and the ripeness of his study .

		The subject matter is arranged in the following order : '' The Survival of Pagan Deities , '' '' The Communion of Gods and Men , '' '' The Relation of Soul and Body , '' '' Cremation and Inhumation , '' '' The Union of Gods and Men . ''

		In these days of aridity of presenta - tion , a reviewer is glad to note that Mr.
Lawson	PERSON	heightens the acceptability of his contribution by a style that is always clear and often fine .

		To any of our readers who are interested in such subjects , we can commend the book most unhesitatingly , with the perhaps unnecessary warning that they must natur - ally expect to differ from the able author about many interpretations , and that occasionally they will find a group of pages where the interest will be lowered except for the technical student of philology .

		The volume contains over six hundred pages , and is an excellent example of good bookmaking .

		With all his faults , the late
Tom L. fcSZ Johnson	PERSON	w .

		as worth y of a more care - fully and intelligently written biog - raphy than the volume which comes to us from the pen of Mr.
Carl Lorenz	PERSON	, through the
A. S. Barnes Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though a friend and admirer of his sub - ject , Mr.
Lorenz	PERSON	does not really understand either the virtues or the faults which entered into the make - up of
Tom L. Johnson	PERSON	.

		Indeed , he seems singularly lacking in any consistent line of demarcation between faults and virtues .

		Again and again he gives Mayor
Johnson	PERSON	credit for high ideals and honesty of pur - pose , and yet we find him saying : '' His friends ever claimed that he was not in politics for personal ambi - tion , but for the cause of the people .

		Yet neither his actions nor his character warranted such an as - sumption .

		It is more likely that he espoused the cause of the people because it would serve him as a ladder to climb into high office . ''

		There could not be a more radical misinterpretation of the man .

		He was wrapped up heart and soul in his attempt to work out certain political principles which he had espoused ; and the one serious weakness of his nature lay in the lack of a nice moral discrimination as to the means which he might allow himself , with the good of the city of
Cleveland	LOCATION	and the people in gen - eral in view .

		He put himself forward not at all because he wanted office for his own glorification , but because he had large faith in his own capacity

		THE DIAL 205 to bring about the ends in view .

		His fundamental type is not an unusual one in American political life , but it had behind it a tremendous practical efficiency .

		Nor did the political reverses near the end bring his life so near the line of actual failure as the reader of this inadequate biography , without further infor - mation , might be led to infer .

		A really competent account of his career , with a just analysis of his per - sonal and political character , would be of great value to seekers after right lines of social and political progress , and we hope that the evident place for such a work may not long remain unfilled .

		Fables of submerged treasure .

		Mr ' Ral P h D - Pace 's `` Book of Buried Treasure '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Wal	ORGANIZATION	- ^ on j j s a veritable cyclopaedia of his - tory and legend relating to the innumerable deposits of fabulous wealth that , at one time or another , have been either involuntarily or purposely made in the ocean 's depths or the dry land 's secret hiding places . ''

		The Pirate 's Own Book , '' the records of Captain
Kidd	PERSON	's adventures , the chronicles of early voyagers , the histories of exploration and discovery , have been drawn upon in the compilation of this attractive vol - ume , which is sure to appeal to every normal boy , and may start more than one hot-headed reader in quest of this or that buried treasure .

		Indeed , the author has foreseen this possibility , and he has thought that '' a concise directory of the best-known lost and buried treasure might be of some service to persons of an adventurous turn of rnind . ''

		There - fore he has appended a '' tabloid guide for ready reference , '' as likely to '' prove helpful , particularly to parents of small boys who have designs on pirate hoards , as well as to boys who have never grown up . ''

		Yet his tabloid guide holds out little encour - agement to the treasure-seeker .

		As to certain gold sunk in
Lake Guatavita	LOCATION	near
Bogota	LOCATION	, for example , he plainly says : `` To find this gold involves driving a tunnel through the side of a mountain and drain - ing the lake .

		This is such a formidable undertaking that it will not appeal to the average treasure-seeker , unless , perchance , he might pick up a second-hand tunnel somewhere at a bargain price .

		Even then , transportation from the seacoast to
Bogota	LOCATION	is so difficult and costly that it would hardly be practica - ble to saw the tunnel into sections and have it car - ried over the mountains on mule-back . ''

		With such warning hints as this , the book is not likely to demor - alize our youth , whom it will certainly interest , as well as their elders of youthful mind .

		A Nietzschean book which Sets ut , to be de '' interpretation scriptive , but is admittedly written of religion .

		from an a priori standpoint , should be viewed with suspicion .

		Mr.
J.	PERSON	M : Kennedy 's '' The Religions and Philosophies of the East '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- amply j ustifies such an attitude .

		The author attempts to describe the main religions of
Asia	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	, and to evaluate them from the standpoint of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's view of good and evil ; and he goes to this trouble -LRB- to quote his own dedication of the book -RRB- '' ad majorem Nietzschli gloriam '' Even if there were no question of the author 's preconceived view of religion as something '' invented '' in the interest of certain classes or types of men who managed to survive through the institution of suitable protective religions , it is doubtful if the many religions he con - siders could possibly be given adequate historical and expository treatment in the compass of 267 pages .

		Having shown , to his own satisfaction , the position of religion in the
East	LOCATION	, the author applies the results to conditions in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Some of these comments of a self-styled disciple of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	may prove diverting .

		Postulating that national deteriora - tion comes , not from immorality or loss of solidarity within a nation , but from the loosening of lines of caste and the consequent mixture of good and medi - ocre blood , he goes on to say : '' A more noxious combination of races , or rather tribes , than those in the
United States of America	LOCATION	, it would be difficult to find . ''

		Of Christianity Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	says : '' The Roman Catholic priest , who thinks for his flock , is a much more noble figure than the Methodist preacher whose congregation l think for themselves . '

		It is gratifying to observe that the Church of En - gland is every year approaching more and more closely to the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	in this particular respect .

		But Christianity must not be imposed on higher spirits who do not want it . ''

		It is probable that Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	is alone in his gratification at tendencies which other people do not appear to ob - serve , and which , were they apparent , would simply be set down as back eddies in the onward flow of the movement toward a wider democracy and the diffu - sion of truth .

		some striking Mr -
Lewis Melville	PERSON	, who has written characteristics understandingly and well , in books of Thackeray .

		an -LRB- j magazine articles , of his beloved
Thackeray	PERSON	, now collects a number of these fugitive papers into a handsome volume , '' Some Aspects of Thackeray '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Three entirely new chapters are added , dealing with ''
Thackeray	PERSON	and the Dignity of Literature , '' ``
Thackeray	PERSON	and the
Newgate School of Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' Some First Editions of Thackeray . ''

		Among sundry other utterances of
Thackeray	PERSON	on the dignity of his call - ing , somewhat in the Colonel
Newcome	PERSON	vein and by no means free from platitude , we find the follow - ing : '' The literary character , let us hope or admit , writes quite honestly ; but no man supposes he would work perpetually but for money .

		Neither , probably , would he write perpetually for money and nothing else . ''

		Again , with a sense of the necessary part played by mediocrity in literature , he says : '' Out of regard for poor dear posterity and men of letters to come , let us be glad that the great immortality number comes up so rarely .

		Mankind would have no time otherwise , and would be so gorged with old masterpieces , that they would not occupy themselves with new , and future literary men would have no ' chance of a livelihood . ''

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	's abundant quotations from
Thackeray	PERSON	are apt , and generally enlivening , even if he does not 206 THE DIAL -LSB-

Ohio	LOCATION	.

		always indicate the exact source of the quotation .

		Among the '' aspects '' under which the great novel - ist is considered are those of reader and critic , where he nowise brilliantly shines , of balladist and of artist , where he is of course delightful , of paro - dist of the
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	school of fiction , of friend to
Dickens	PERSON	and warm eulogist of his works , of pen - picturer of eighteenth-century
London	LOCATION	, and so on .

		Numerous illustrations help to sustain the interest of the work .

		The charm of pioneer life in the backwoods is felt in every chapter and almost every page of '' A Buck - eye Boyhood , '' from the pen of a
Buckeye	LOCATION	author of note , Dr.
William Henry Venable	PERSON	, and from the publishing house of a
Cincinnati	LOCATION	firm , the
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the infancy of the boy '' Tip , '' who is unmistakably the chronicler himself , in
the fourth decade	DATE	of the last centnry , to the casting of his first presidential ballot for Lincoln in
1860	DATE	, the homely and engrossing narrative holds the reader 's willing attention through a variety of scenes and incidents such as every genuine American has some fading knowledge of , either from childhood experi - ence or from ancestral tradition .

		The little log schoolhouse , with its uneven floor of puncheons and its rude door swinging on strap hinges , a door later to be burst in by a pale and consumptive Yankee schoolmaster with a fence-rail for a battering-ram , as the surprising sequel to a barring-out frolic , plays its familiar but always freshly interesting part in the rural history .

		The vast forest , with its delights and its perils , also furnishes its element of the adven - turous and picturesque .

		A little later , the advent of the railway and the dazzling allurements of the wonderful city of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	enliven the narrative .

		But '' Tip '' came of a family with a passion for books , a family that gathered after supper around the evening lamp and enjoyed together the latest pro- curable good novel or biography or history or other readable and profitable work ; and so we trace the nurture and growth of the future poet , historian , and novelist , whose early years he himself has so enter - tainingly described .

Durazzi	PERSON	, but it required more trouble to obtain admission than I was willing to give myself . ''

		For this , or some other reason , it remains true that ''
Genoa	LOCATION	the Proud '' is one of the least known of all Italian cities .

		Hence it is worth while to consult Mr.
Edgcumbe Staley	PERSON	's '' Heroines of
Genoa	LOCATION	and the Rivieras '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with its two dozen fine illus - trations , mostly reproductions of little-known paint - ings housed in Genoese palaces .

		Unfortunately , the author has a passion for fine writing , and it sometimes leads him astray from the straight paths of fact .

		For example , in the concluding chapter , '' Riviera Romances , '' he is betrayed into calling Lerici '' the home of poets , '' after this fashion : '' Villa
Maccarini	PERSON	was Lord
Byron	PERSON	's home
Villa Magni	ORGANIZATION	,
Shelley 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Peace , beauty , and repose were in the atmosphere of the old-world town , slumber - ing in its wealth of ambrosial gardens ... Tears sprang copiously from the eyes of sorrowing peasant women , gathering kelp , who discovered , on
July 22 , 1822	DATE	, two battered corpses , cast up by the turbulent sea at
Bocca Lerici	PERSON	they were
John Williams	PERSON	and
Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	. ''

		Scarcely one of the state - ments of these resounding sentences is true .

		Shel - ley 's house on the
Bay of Lerici	LOCATION	, when he lived in it , was called Villa Maccarini ; since then , a third story has been added and its name changed to
Villa Magni	ORGANIZATION	.

		Byron never lived in it , nor is there any record of even a visit there by him .

		The house is not located at the town of
Lerici	LOCATION	, nor amid any '' ambrosial gardens , '' but on the rocky shore of
San Terenzo	LOCATION	, then as now a fishing-village of the rudest type .

		If peasant women wept over any '' battered corpses , '' they were not those of Shelley and
Williams	PERSON	-LRB- the latter 's name , by the way , was
Edward	PERSON	, not John -RRB- .

		The `` turbulent seas '' of
Bocca Lerici	PERSON	had nothing to do with the disaster which cost the lives of the poet and his friend ; this occurred a short distance out from
Leghorn	LOCATION	, and the bodies were recovered -LRB- but not on the same day -RRB- near
Viareggio	LOCATION	, a point much south of the
Bay of Lerici	ORGANIZATION	.

		When such well-known facts as these are dressed up out of all recognition , doubts naturally arise as to the author 's accuracy in more essential , though less familiar , matters .

		Labrador : its Mr ' W ' G ''
Gosling	PERSON	, in a volume of history and some five hundred and seventy-four present state .

		pages on Labrador -LRB- Lane -RRB- , has brought together a great deal of interesting informa - tion in regard to the history and the present state of that interesting region .

		The author tells us that his design has been '' to preserve the knowledge of the incidents which took place in the past , and which are likely to have some value in the development of the country in the future . ''

		The design is a laudable one , and would be altogether praiseworthy were it not for the fact that much of the information in this bulky volume was already accessible in modern books .

		The very titles of Mr.
Gosling	PERSON	's chapters `` The Norsemen 's Visit to Labrador , '' `` The Cabots , '' ''
Jacques Cai	PERSON	` tier , '' '' Search for the North-west Pas - sage , '' `` The English Occupation , '' `` The Moravian Brethren , '' `` The Americans on the Labrador , '' '' The Boundary Dispute , '' '' Dr.
Wilfrid Grenfell	PERSON	, '' etc. , at once suggest sources that are conveniently accessible to every reader ; and it must be said that Mr.
Gosling	PERSON	adds little of value to the discussion of such mooted points as the landfall of
Cabot	LOCATION	, the voyages of the
Northmen	PERSON	, the derivation of the name Labrador , and the much-discussed boundary ques - tion .

		The text is also disfigured by numerous typo - graphical errors , such as '' Rodisson '' for Radisson , '' Grosseliers '' for Groseilliers , '' Hearn '' for

		It is a compilation of a type made very familiar of late years in the field of educational publi - cation .

Western Europe	LOCATION	in the Middle Ages , '' the maps of `` Mediaeval Commerce , '' that of the `` Conquest of
Peru	LOCATION	, '' and that of the `` Distribution of Races in
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	. ''

		We should hardly know where else to look for these , or for some others of the rich collec - tion now provided .

		A school room in which the memorization of the printed page and compulsory silence are conspicuously absent , and in which the pupil 's hands and eyes are active , is the ideal , for the first three years of school life , held forth by Professor
Davidson	PERSON	of the
State University of Maine	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a small volume , '' Motor Work and Formal Studies : A Provisional Syllabus for the
First Three Primary Grades	ORGANIZATION	, '' are given the results of two of his students ,
Frank G. Wadsworth	PERSON	and
Winthrop H. Stanley	PERSON	, in a pioneer study of the proper correlation of such hand work as is generally associated with the kindergarten and the more formal studies during the first years of school life .

		To this study , given in the form of a syllabus , Professor
Davidson	PERSON	prefixes an introduction warning teachers against too great rigidity and formalism of discipline , when carrying out such a scheme of work for young children .

		The ninth '' grove play '' of the
Bohemian Club	ORGANIZATION	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, as given a month ago on the occasion of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	's annual `` midsummer jinks , '' was entitled '' The Green Knight '' the words by Mr.
Porter Gar	PERSON	- nett , the music by Mr.
Edward G. Striekler	PERSON	.

		In the beautifully-printed book of the play , now before us , we have , besides the text , an interesting explanatory intro - duction , a synopsis of the music , a diagram of the out - door theatre , and plates illustrating the costumes .

		The exhibit is most interesting , and makes one wish that he might have witnessed the festivities .

		Here is something which may almost be described as an original art-form , springing from its native environment , and lovingly shaped in accordance with an ideal purpose .

		For young persons , and for those little conversant with books and libraries , Mr.
Gilbert O. Ward	PERSON	's elementary manual on '' The Practical Use of Books and Libraries '' -LRB-
Boston Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will prove a useful guide .

		Its eight chapters deal successively with the structure and care of a book , the printed parts of a book , the card catalogue , the numbering and arranging of books in public libraries , reference books , magazines , the use of the library in debating , and buying books . ''

		Do not use a match , a lead pencil , or a handkerchief '' for a book-mark , counsels the author ; and he might have added to his list of unde - sirable markers known to juvenile readers , jack-knives , candy , and chewing-gum .

		In the book-buying chapter , his advice on subscription books is this : '' Books sold by subscription or through an agent should always be bought very cautiously , and when published by unknown publishers are best let alone . ''

		NOTES .

		The title of Mr.
William de Morgan	PERSON	's forthcoming novel has been changed from ''
Bianca	PERSON	'' to '' A Likely Story '' thus keeping up the De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	tradition for distinctive nomenclature . ''

		Legends of Long Ago , '' being an English rendering by Dr.
Charles Hart Handschin	PERSON	of
Gottfried Keller	PERSON	's ''
Sieben Legenden	PERSON	, '' is announced as the second volume of '' The Abbey Translations , '' to be issued shortly by the
Abbey Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	's articles entitled '' Shakespeare on the Stage , '' which have been one of the most interest - ing features of the '' Century Magazine '' during the past few months , are soon to be published in book form by Messrs.
Moft	PERSON	` at ,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American edition of Professor
Archibald Hender	PERSON	- son 's critical biography of
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, which has been the occasion of a merry newspaper war between the biographer and his subject , is to be published by
Messrs. Stewart & Kidd of Cincinnati	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two biographies of
Count Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	are in press for early publication One of these , to be issued by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the work of Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, whose translations of
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	are well known .

		The other is a translation from the French of
M. Romain Holland	PERSON	, the author of ''
Jean Christophe	PERSON	, '' and will bear the imprint of
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Edwin Asa Dix	PERSON	, who died very suddenly last month at the
National Arts Club	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, at the age of fifty-one , was best known as the author of
Deacon Bradbury	PERSON	, '' '' Old
Bowen	PERSON	's Legacy , '' '' Prophet 's Land - 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ing , '' ``
Quincy Baxter	PERSON	, '' a life of
Champlain	LOCATION	, and a volume of travels in the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	.

		He was also a fre - quent contributor to the magazines , and for a while was literary editor of '' The Churchman . ''

		The formation of a society for the elevation of liter - ary ideals is reported from
New York	LOCATION	, with a member - ship composed of former associates and pupils of Mr.
George Edward Woodberry	PERSON	, at one time professor of comparative literature at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and well known to the larger public as author of `` The Inspiration of Poetry , '' '' Makers of Literature , '' an excellent life of
Poe	PERSON	, and several volumes of verse , with other works .

		It is to advance the ideals for which he , as a teacher of literature , stood , without that cordial support from the university authorities which he seemed to deserve , that the new association has been formed among his disciples and admirers .

		Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	is editing a volume of personal re - collections and appreciations of his father by various writers , which Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	wiil publish under the title ''
Tennyson	PERSON	and his Friends . ''

		The chapters include '' Early Reminiscences , '' by
Emily Lady Tenny	PERSON	- son ; '' Recollections of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' by the
Master of Trinity	ORGANIZATION	; `` Tennyson and
James Spedding	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
W. Aldis Wright	PERSON	; ''
Tennyson	PERSON	and
FitzGerald	PERSON	, '' by the President of
Magdalen	LOCATION	; `` Tennyson and
Thackeray	PERSON	, '' by Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	; `` Tennyson and
Dean Bradley	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	; `` Tennyson and Music , '' by Sir
Charles Stanford	PERSON	; ''
Tennyson	PERSON	and Science , '' by Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	; `` Tennyson and Religion , '' by the Bishop of
Ripon	LOCATION	; and `` Tennyson and Art , '' by
E. V. B	ORGANIZATION	.

		A great awakening in
Texas	LOCATION	to the needs and oppor - tunities of its young but already vigorous State Uni - versity is the object of certain important resolutions adopted last commencement by the alumni association of that institution .

		It is hoped that by thus arousing public interest , and by offering substantial prizes for the best plans and suggestions , architectural and edu - cational , for the material and intellectual development of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, a state institution of higher learning may be built up that shall adequately represent the nobler aspirations and ideals of the great commonwealth of
Texas	LOCATION	.

		The raising of a sum of at least
$ 125,000	MONEY	for the work in hand has been undertaken by the alumni association .

		The whole scheme , as described in a leaflet sent out by Mr.
John A. Lomax	PERSON	, secretary-treasurer of the association , is of large dimensions , and its full reali - zation must take years of concerted effort and generous expenditure .

		A third of a century of decimal classification success - fully applied to hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of book collections , both public and private , is what Mr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	can now complacently look back upon .

		Thirty-five years , to be exact , have passed since the famous Dewey system , conceived and elaborated in its inventor 's undergraduate years , was put forth to supply a manifest need among librarians ; and now the seventh edition of the work , naturally much amended and en - larged , makes its appearance .

		The repeated overhauling and correcting of this standard work remind one of that German thoroughness and scholarly conscientiousness that every year produce so many new-old books , um - gearbeitet , verbessert , and vergrossert by their infinitely painstaking authors .

		Obviously , no scheme of book - classification can long remain thoroughly up-to-date in all its details .

		New fields of learned research are con - stantly being entered upon , and each has its indispen - sable literature .

		ANNOUNCEMENT LIST OF FALL BOOKS .

		The classified compilation given herewith as the prospective output of new books for the Fall and
Winter	DATE	season of 1911-12 is , we believe , the largest list of the sort we have ever published .

		Including the two departments of '' School and College Text - books '' and `` Books for the Young , '' which on account of lack of space we are compelled to carry over to our next issue , our list of Fall announce - ments this year comprises nearly two thousand titles , representing the output of sixty leading American publishing houses .

		This list has as usual been prepared especially for our pages , from the most authentic information to be obtained .

		As afford - ing a trustworthy bird 's - eye view , as it were , of the forthcoming publishing season , its interest and value to every bookbuyer whether librarian , bookseller , or private purchaser will be at once apparent .

		All the books entered are new books new editions not being included unless having new form or mat - ter .

		Some of the more interesting features among these announcements are commented upon in the leading editorial in this number of THE DIAL .

		Dr.
Denton J. Snider	PERSON	is regarded by the European intellectual world as one of the greatest living philosophers and thinkers .

		In this country he is best known as the author of widely read Commentaries on
Shakespeare , Dante	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		These essay s rank as masterpieces throughout the literary world .

		From 18G4 to 1867 Professor
Snider	PERSON	taught Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, English Literature , Mathematics and History in the
Chris	PERSON	- tian
Brothers ' College	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		This was followed by ten years 1 teaching in the
St. Louis High School	ORGANIZATION	, during which time Professor
Snider	PERSON	added
Mental Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	,
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to his subjects .

		Since
1877	DATE	he has given his entire time to lecturing and the preparation of Uni - versal Psychology .

		In
1894	DATE
Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	conferred a degree upon Pro lessor
Snider	PERSON	, '' her greatest scholar . ''

		Eight years later Dr.
Snider	PERSON	, who for some time had been living in
Chicago	LOCATION	, returned to
St. Louis	LOCATION	at the earnest solicitation of the
St. Louis Society of Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, an organization of several hundred members , formed for the study of
Universal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Snider	PERSON	is the author of thirty-four vol - umes , which include works on litera - ture , biography , art , music , architec - ture and philosophy .

		PSYCHOLOGY The New Science Universal By Dr.
DENTON J. SNIDER	PERSON	Of deep interest to all thinking people , the salient character of
Universal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	may be indicated in the fact that it is neither metaphysical nor physical in method or matter , but purely psychological .

		Slowly the science of Psychology has been pushing to the front as the
Universal Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it has been hitherto handicapped by alien methods foisted upon it .

		So we have had chiefly two kinds : the old Rational -LRB- so - called -RRB- Psychology , dominated by the metaphysical system of some phil - osopher , and the more recent
Psychological Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, dominated by the procedure of
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present system maintains a view opposite to , yet inclusive of both these methods .

		Psychology is proclaimed the master of the house , no longer the subordinate ; it is to organize Philosophy and
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	, and not to be organized by them .

		It is the new
Universal Science	ORGANIZATION	and openly asserts itself as a system in spite of to-day 's pragmatic prejudice against all systems .

		The only work of this kind wrought out to completion in the English language .

		During the past ten years or more he has worked persistently and devotedly to restore the modern stage to something of its lost dignity , to revive the Art -LRB- as important as any other of the Fine Arts -RRB- now coffined in the Theatrical Crypt .

		His writings on the subject , and his actual stage presentations of noted plays in

		It is safe to say that his forthcoming volume will be more widely read and discussed , and will have a more potent influence , than any other book on the Theatre issued in years .

		`` If the stage were not soggy with inutile traditions , such a book as

		266 HARD WORDS ABOUT PEDAGOGY .

		Sound sense and piquant comment are com - bined in about equal measure in a paper entitled '' Pedagogy and the Teacher , '' contributed to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' by Dr.
Warner Fite	PERSON	.

		It is indeed refreshing to come across so sane and illuminating a discussion of first prin - ciples in the field of pedagogical literature a field whose desert expanse is only now and then relieved by an oasis of clean-cut thought and stimulating suggestion .

		The author makes no bones of this aspect of his subject . ''

		If we except a few excellect works on the history of education , it may be said that the literature of peda - gogy as a science has contributed virtually nothing either to scholarship or to ideas .

		This is not to deny that a few men of ideas who were getting them elsewhere have had something good to say .

		Curiously enough , these occasional and unprofessional contributions to the subject are apt to be the most prized .

		Within the pro- fessional field , however , there are no men to measure with the larger men of other fields , and , with two or three respectable , but not brilliant , exceptions , the whole literature is banal and inane . ''

		Those who have the widest acquaintance with this literature will acquiesce the most heartily in this judgment , for they are the ones who know most fully what vaporings masquerade as profound philosophy in this twilight realm of thought , and what solemn platitudes are here elaborated for the guidance of young men and women who are preparing themselves for the work of teaching .

		The modern science of pedagogy , as exempli - fied in its literature and in its practical appli - cations , is little more than a pretentious hum - bug that has grown like an excrescence upon our body educational .

		Its practitioners have '' stolen the scraps '' from the feast of learning scraps of philosophy and psychology for the most part and have warmed them over into a new dish at which the normal stomach revolts .

		The fare is filling , no doubt , but innutritious , and those who feed upon it for long periods find their tissues grown flabby and their blood sup - plied with a plentiful lack of red corpuscles .

		Their minds come to inhabit a world of abstrac - tions in which little account is taken of the facts of life , and when they imagine that they are thinking they are really engaged in a process as futile as a cat 's pursuit of its own tail .

		They are the victims of a system which has done its 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, best to deaden their faculties , and the only sav - ing thing about their plight is that , when the time comes for them to engage in the work for which they have supposed themselves to be pre - paring , they are still young enough for nature to come to the partial rescue of their devitalized mentality .

		If they can slough off the greater part of their forced pedagogical growths , and if they have the good sense to cast aside nearly everything in the way of method and syllabus and formulary with which they have been fitted out in the `` school of education , '' it is still pos - sible for them , despite the handicap , to grow into good teachers .

		But what a waste there has been in the making , and how much easier they might achieve success had they given to liberal culture the years that they gave to '' profes - sional '' preparation !

		For it is the ordered con - tent of the mind that counts in this work , and not the construction of the containing vessel ; it is not the formal but the substantial equip - ment of the teacher that makes him a vitalizing influence upon youthful minds .

		But the system is now in the saddle , and rides mankind , or such part of mankind as is required for educational service .

		The authorities have contrived to fix things so that it is difficult for anyone to get into educational work without hav - ing paid tribute to the established pedagocracy . ''

		Early in the era of academic expansion it was perceived that a rich and permanent source for the numbers that are supposed to attract endowments and appropriations lay in the prospective teachers ; and to - day it may be said that an important part of the work of all of our universities , and the mainstay of the Western institutions , is the training of teachers for the secondary schools .

		To bring the teachers to the university , a department of education is established which offers to furnish professional training upon a scientific basis . ''

		This is the milk in the cocoanut , for , as Dr.
Fite	PERSON	remarks , the condition upon which young men and women may be pronounced fitted for teaching is that they `` associate with the pro- fessors of pedagogy '' for a stated number of weeks , and '' listen to their wisdom regarding its science of education . ''

		But a certificate of mere educational success , such as the degree of bachelor of arts , '' will produce no fitness whatever except as it covers the requirement of pedagogy . ''

		So profitable a source of rev - enue , once tapped by the schools of higher edu - cation , is not likely to be given up save upon compulsion , and in consequence of an awaken - ing of general intelligence of which the present trend of educational development gives only faint promise .

		And yet the writer does not seem to indulge in over-statement when he says : '' I believe that , if released from the obligations of professional courtesy , a nine-tenths vote of our college professors would support me in saying that , as a rule , the professors of education are the least educated men in the university faculty , from the standpoint either of general culture or of special attainment .

		I say , ' as a rule , ' because there are exceptions ; they , however , would vote with the nine-tenths . ''

		Concerning the actual workings of '' peda - gogy as she is practised '' in the institutions which prepare teachers for their profession , these sober and deliberate words may well be taken to heart : '' The idea of vocational training , already too promi - nent , is substituted for that of intellectual discipline and personal culture , and vocational training is then trans - lated into job - getting .

		At the same time a class of stu - dents is brought to the university to whom the idea of a university ' is foreign and unintelligible , and perhaps the entrance-bars are lowered to let them in .

		Often painfully illiterate and deplorably in need of the power of forming a few simple and clear ideas , in spite of the technical completion of a high-school course , these stu - dents are then dosed with platitudes about the social function of the school and the aims and methods of education .

		Such is the general situation .

		Familiarity with its character would suggest that what the public school teacher especially needs to learn , and what the university is especially called upon to teach him , is just this that his real efficiency as a teacher , and his ability to speak to his boys and girls from the standpoint of personal and social authority , will depend in the last analysis , not upon any mastery of the ' formal principles of method , ' or what not , but upon the soundness and breadth of his knowledge and upon the evidence in himself of a thoughtful attitude towards life .

		With this idea , however , the pedagogy of the university , as of the normal school , is wholly unfamiliar . ''

		It is a severe indictment , but one which , in our judgment , is firmly based upon the facts of the situation , as well as upon the principles of the only pedagogy from which a fruitful outcome may be expected .

		The pernicious system at present in vogue is probably , at bottom , the product of economic pressure .

		Persons who are really fit to teach are worth more than the pub - lic is willing to pay them , but there is a certain semblance of fitness that may be cheaply pro- duced , and their production is the final cause of the chair of pedagogy and the school of educa - tion of which it is the chief article of furniture .

		`` In the university generally , mention of the department of pedagogy is very likely to be accompanied by a smile .

		Pedagogical courses are everywhere regarded as snap courses , and pedagogical methods of teaching are usually the worst . ''

		An important feature of the pedagogical curriculum is what is called '' educational psy - chology , '' since the educational task is neces - sarily the application of psychological principles
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 to particular problems .

		Now psychology is one of the essential elements of liberal culture , and we have not a word to say against it .

		But just why it should be styled `` educational '' when used for pedagogical discipline is a good deal of a mystery .

		Some light is thrown upon it by Dr.
Fite	PERSON	's statement that in one institution of which he knows the students distinguish between what they call `` the men 's psychology '' and '' the girls ' psychology '' the former being the regular courses , and the latter the courses given with vocational intent .

		There is a world of meaning in this distinction , for a close acquaint - ance with '' the girls ' psychology '' is likely to show it to be a greatly diluted science , chiefly concerned with what
James	PERSON	calls '' the unprofit - able delineation of the obvious . ''

		It has much to say about '' apperception '' and other blessed words , but its teachings are little more than plain common sense in transparent disguise .

		This is the reason why the comparison so fre - quently made between the training of the teacher and the training of the lawyer or the physician fails so completely when we consider it closely .

		Dr.
Fite	PERSON	punctures this false analogy very neatly when he points out that medical and legal science possess `` a body of definite facts and established principles which would be unaccessible to trained observation and common sense , '' whereas the science of education `` is mostly a science on paper , hastily got together ad
Aoc	ORGANIZATION	, by a process of forced abstraction , to meet the demands of a professional analogy . ''

		The practical conclusion of the whole matter , as Dr.
Fite	PERSON	views it , in our opinion with entirely sound judgment , is that , having got our pro- spective teachers into the university , we should cease feeding them upon the husks of pedagogy , and should oppose at every point the demand of school authorities for the husk-fed product .

		We believe that the degree won wholly or largely in the '' school of education '' means less for liberal education than the degree won in regular course , and especially that it means less for teaching efficiency . ''

		If the university is to be of service to the teacher , then it must be said that no need of the teaching pro- fession is clearer at present than that of a sound and liberal education .

		So fundamental is this need that the science and art of teaching sink into humorous in - significance .

		If it be objected that a bachelor of arts is not necessarily acquainted with methods of teaching , the simple reply may that he has been taught for four - teen to sixteen years past by a great variety of methods .

		It is curious that pedagogy never thinks of this , for just in this way are the good teachers made by the intelligent adaption of the best methods by which they themselves have been taught . ''

		This seems to us an absolutely unanswerable refutation of the argument upon which the `` pedagogical sophistic '' is based .

		It is less by conscious method than by instinctive faculty that the teacher is really successful , and a resort to the former means , for the most part , that the latter has never been acquired .

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		ABSOLUTE CRITICISM OF LITERATURE is some - thing to be welcomed if it can be shown to rest on sure foundations .

		Mr.
Herbert E. Cory	PERSON	, in a pam - phlet entitled `` The Critics of
Edmund Spenser	PERSON	, '' issued by the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, modestly proposes such a method .

		It seems to consist of a collation and comparison of past opinions on an author .

		Variorum criticism might be a more apt name for it .

		It certainly differs from the impres - sionistic mode now in vogue , or the older compar - ative or analytic processes .

		It results , in Mr.
Cory	PERSON	's hands , in bringing together a varied and val - uable body of judgments about
Spenser	PERSON	, much of which must be unknown except to special students .

		And , fortunately , Mr.
Cory	PERSON	does not halt with the reproduction of other men 's thoughts , but gives us some valuable opinions of his own .

		He has several theses to sustain .

		The first of these is that
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's merits have been on the whole very highly and quite evenly assessed during all the changes of taste since he wrote .

		The Augustans themselves bowed to his genius .

		It would have been strange indeed if these great writers had been deaf and blind to his harmonious speech and im - aginative pictures .

		But in opinions about
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's allegory and the didactic turn of his poetry there have been many heretics .

		Against these Mr.
Cory	PERSON	couches a lance .

		Undoubtedly Spenser '' moralized his song '' ; most poets do , in one way or another .

		But is didacticism the essence of his work ?

		Alle - gory and parable are undying literary devices .

		They have been revived of late with much success .

		But they do not seem to have the vitality of more direct renderings of life .

		And they are apt to be the parents of platitude .

		Spenser has enough narrative interest and human nature to keep his work alive even though we take
Hazlitt	PERSON	's advice and decline to meddle with the allegory .

		The Red Cross Knight ,
Sir Guyon	PERSON	,
Una	LOCATION	, Britomart , and
Belphcebe	PERSON	are very real and interesting people .

		They are great poetic creations , and can stand erect without leaning on the staff of symbol .

		Mr.
Cory	PERSON	's study ought to be welcomed , not only for its good sense and good writing , but as the sign of a turning toward belles lettres by our university scholars .

		How TO ECONOMIZE BOOK-SPACE presents itself daily as a perplexing problem for the librarian of a growing library .

		The resourceful librarian of
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
George T. Little	PERSON	, in a paper 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, read before the
American Library Institute	ORGANIZATION	at its late meeting in
New York	LOCATION	,
September 27	DATE	and 28 , described a novel scheme that seems to work well in
Maine	LOCATION	, and ought to prove equally satisfactory else - where .

		Instead of fixed shelves with intervening passages , a part of the Bowdoin bookstacks have closely-contiguous sliding book-cases , with proper aisle space and lighting to admit of their being drawn out one by one as desired .

		Ball-bearing rollers or wheels , metal rails sunk in the floor , and a guiding slot and T iron at the top , are required for the combined movability and firmness of these novel shelves , whose construction seems to have been suggested to Mr.
Little	PERSON	by a notable paper of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's in '' The Nineteenth Century '' for
March , 1890	DATE	, on the housing of books .

		Other papers and discussions , especially on branch libraries in schoolhouses , engaged the attention of the Insti - tute members in session in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The mem - bership of this body , a sort of doubly distilled and highly concentrated
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, now entering on its seventh year , comprises a little more than half a hundred of our leading library workers , with a managing board made up of such well-known librarians as John Cotton
Dana	PERSON	,
Frank P. Hill	PERSON	,
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	,
Henry J. Carr	PERSON	,
Thomas L. Montgomery	PERSON	,
William T. Peoples	PERSON	, and
Henry M. Utley	PERSON	.

		... THE MOVEMENT FOR A FREYTAG MEMORIAL of some sort , to adorn his native town of Kreuz - burg in
Upper Silesia	LOCATION	, will appeal to the German - American lovers of that author , and probably also to some Americans with no Teutonic blood in their veins , but with a love of
Freytag	ORGANIZATION	's books in their hearts .

		In a call for cooperation in this good work , we are reminded , in sentences unmistakably German even in their English dress , that ''
Gustav Freytag	PERSON	has , like no other , disclosed the comprehension of national life and feeling .

		He drew in vigorous pictures the rise of the German people , and the figures in his works preach the knowledge that only German power and a true German spirit are capable of giving a rich meaning even to the brilliant picture of the present . ''

		The petition continues : '' In the national life of our people will
Gustav Freytag	PERSON	ever stand as an admonisher and leader , particularly in the east provinces , whose child he was .

		For this reason awoke also in his native town Kreuzburg the thought of placing a memorial to their greatest and most renowned son , in order that his spirit may remain alive .

		In the old German town , which more than six hundred years ago was founded by the Knights of the Red Star and the German colonists , the memorial shall be erected , and in the year 191 6 , to celebrate the hundredth return of
Gustav Frey	PERSON	- tag 's birthday , be unveiled .

		But for this purpose the support of the more distant circles of the German people is necessary .

		American subscriptions are re - quested to be sent to Messrs.

		GEORGE ELIOT IN A NEW ASPECT , or in several rather new aspects , is revealed in an unpublished collection of letters lately given to the British Mu - seum by Mr.
Roland Stuart	PERSON	, the son of Mrs.
Alma Stuart	PERSON	to whom the letters were written by her novelist friend .

		Some extracts have appeared in the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' from which the following , written in
1879	DATE	, may be quoted as containing an interesting bit of self-portrayal : '' The lovely shawl has come in safety .

		... I shall often wrap myself in your affection , otherwise called my Shetland shawl -LRB- by the way , the brown border is perfect -RRB- .

		I confess I tremble a little at the prospect of your seeing me in the flesh .

		At present I have the charm of a ` Yarrow unvisited . '

		As to the portrait , I am not one bit like it besides , it was taken
eight years ago	DATE	.

		Imagine a first cousin of the old
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's rather smoke-dried a face with lines in it that seem a map of sorrows .

		These portraits seen beforehand are detestable introductions , only less disadvantageous than a description by an ardent friend to one who is neither a friend nor ardent . ''

		Curiously sensitive as to her personal looks was
George Eliot	PERSON	, for one of such vigor of intellect and strength of character .

		Readers of her novels will recall her occasional passing references to the crushing sense of shame one feels at a sudden glimpse , in a mirror or in the unfriendly words of another , of oneself in the least becoming light , or of one 's least prepossessing feature .

		Something more than a coolly objective treatment of the matter seems to reveal itself in these references .

		Can it be that
George Eliot	PERSON	cherished a lifelong feminine yearning for that personal beauty that was so notably denied her ?

		THE INDESTRUCTIBLE IDENTITY OF SHAKE - SPEARE forms the subject of a characteristic paper by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in the current '' Cornhill . ''

		That the plays and poems of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	were written by some other man of the same name , as has been recently argued , is vehemently disputed by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, who selects as the special foeman worthy of his steel Mr.
G. G. Greenwood	PERSON	, author of `` The Shakespeare Problem Restated . ''

		Here is the whole matter in a nutshell , from the body of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's clear and convincing statement of the case : '' When contemporaries of Shakespeare wrote about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays and poems , they had no reason to add , ' We mean the plays and poems of Mr.
William Shakespeare	PERSON	of My
Lord of Leicester	ORGANIZATION	's servants , or of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's servants . '

		There was no other
William Shakespeare	PERSON	in the public eye ; everyone concerned with the stage and literature knew well who
William Shak	PERSON	any spelling you please was .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	does not seem to understand that an important actor in the greatest dramatic company of the age , one of the
King	PERSON	's servants , a groom of the
Royal Bedchamber	ORGANIZATION	, was a notable figure in the town ; and that as no other
William Shakespeare	PERSON	or Shakspere was notable ,
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 critics who wrote about
William Shakespeare	PERSON	's plays did not need to tell their readers who
William Shakespeare	PERSON	was , did not need to say ' we mean the actor . ' ''

		Neither Homer nor
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	will sell his life otherwise than dearly so long as the hand that wrote the foregoing is able to grasp a pen .

		A POPULAR AUTHOR 'S MOST DANGEROUS RIVAL is not infrequently himself at his best which is often an earlier , fresher , delightfully surprising and unsuspectedly gifted self whom he is never after - ward able to equal .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, for example , seems to many of his admirers never to have dis - played such brilliance as in those first short-story masterpieces with which he astonished two hemi - spheres .

		The recent death of Mrs.
Katherine Cecil Thurston	PERSON	recalls the international success of her early novel -LRB- the second from her pen -RRB- , `` The Masquerader , '' known in
England	LOCATION	as `` JohnChilcote ,
M.P.	LOCATION	, '' and known in translation to German , French , Swedish , Norwegian , and Danish readers .

		Its pub - lication dates seven years back , but neither `` The Gambler , '' nor '' The Fly on the Wheel , '' nor any - thing else that she afterward wrote , achieved the fame of that ingeniously planned and skilfully exe - cuted earlier piece of work .

		Mrs.
Thurston	PERSON	was barely in her thirties when she died , and might very possibly have gone on to higher things in fiction than she had yet attained .

		Surely , a writer 's mature productions ought , other things being equal , to be his best ; but the fact remains , striking from its very anomaly , that they not always are his best .

		A REVIVAL OF THE OLD-TIME '' LYCEUM LEC - TURE '' is promised in the coming lectures in this country of Mrs.
Margaret L. Woods	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, formerly of
Oxford	LOCATION	, where her father and her hus - band were connected with the university .

		Among those from whom Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	has letters of introduc - tion are Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	writes of her : '' No academic lecturer can possess the charm of a brilliant woman of the world . ''

		For the
last quarter	DATE	of a century she has been in familiar intercourse with many of those prominent in liter - ature and in education in her own country , and she has been much in society .

		As a woman of letters , Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	is known on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	for her novels , `` A Village Tragedy , '' ``
Esther Vanhomrigh	PERSON	, '' '' The Vagabonds , '' and others .

		Her American lectures , some of which are expected to be on historical subjects , will begin in
November	DATE	, with one at the
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		THE LATEST GIFT OF A VETERAN PHILANTHRO - PIST is that in which Dr.
Daniel K. Pearson	PERSON	conveys his old homestead in
Hillsdale	LOCATION	, 111. , to the public library trustees of that town , not to be itself used as a library building , as was first planned , but to be sold , with four acres of the land on which it stands , the proceeds to be devoted to the erection of a suit - able structure for the village library , which is further enriched with the valuable collection of paintings and statuary acquired by Dr. and Mrs.
Pearson	PERSON	in their foreign travels .

		This generous act , together with his recent gift of fifty thousand dollars to the
Chicago City Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	, seems to indicate that Dr.
Pearson	PERSON	's late valedictory as public benefactor was not meant in entire serious - ness , and that he had not at that time quite reached the bottom of his apparently inexhaustible purse .

		THE HUNGARIAN WAY OF REWARDING GENIUS seems to be a very agreeable way for the beneficiary .

		Among the illustrated books of
last Christmas	DATE	it may be remembered that Mr.
Willy Pog	PERSON	^ ny 's strikingly beautiful and appropriate dress for `` The Ancient Mariner '' elicited warm and merited praise .

		None of the color books of the season surpassed it in excellence .

		Now there comes word from
Budapest	LOCATION	that the Hungarian government has bestowed upon the accomplished illustrator a mark of its recognition of his genius by purchasing the originals of several of the '' Ancient Mariner '' drawings and by present - ing him a neat little gift of ten thousand francs , or its equivalent in the money of the Magyars .

		* THE TEACHING OF THE ART OF PRINTING has been undertaken by two widely different institu - tions ,
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	and the
International Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The university course is a general one which aims to fit the student to conduct a printing establishment and to produce printing that conforms to the canons and best traditions of the art .

		The
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	's course is arranged with the active cooperation of `` The Inland Printer '' in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and to some extent specializes in the higher grades of display work .

		The results of both experiments will be watched with interest .

		SOME ENGLISH LITER AR Y FAMILIES .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Literary families are perhaps not as common as we might expect .

		Genius in general does not appear to descend from parents to children as inevitably as certain other characteristics , such as gout or a hooked nose .

		In the arts of music and painting there have been more notable examples than in letters .

		The family of
Bach	ORGANIZATION	must easily distance all competition in this respect : it was of importance in the musical world for nearly two hundred years .

		The brothers
Van Eyck	PERSON	uphold worthily the honor of a great family of painters .

		When we search the records of literature , it is chiefly among the smaller fry that we discover similar instances .

		Talent may be trans - mitted , but hardly genius .

		The latter , indeed , may be defined as a predisposition to the abnormal , apt to manifest itself in slightly different forms in suc - ceeding generations .

		The child of a poet may dis - play a predilection for drawing , even as the son of a gouty patient may be liable to eczema .

		The artis .

		244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, tic instinct assumes many forms : it is not so stable a matter as the instinct for money-making , which is common not only to certain families but to whole races .

		For all that , the inheritance of a predisposi - tion toward writing is not rare ; the rarity lies in the descendant achieving the success one would expect from the child of so distinguished a parent .

		Probably in many cases the celebrity of the father is the undoing of the son .

		Comparisons are naturally invited between the second wearer of a famous name and the great original ; there is even a spice of ani - mosity in the attitude of the public toward the upstart who has dared to use the honored patronymic .

		For this reason , sons and daughters of celebrated artists who intend to practise in the same field may be ad - vised to select other names .

		With daughters , this is comparatively a simple matter ; they can and generally do marry ; sometimes they make assur - ance doubly sure by assuming a pen-name as well .

		For example , the daughter of the late
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, known in private life as Mrs. St.
Leger Harrison	PERSON	, writes and has written for many years under the name of
Lucas Malet	PERSON	;
Thackeray	PERSON	's daugh - ter , marrying Mr.
Richmond Ritchie	PERSON	, saw her hus - band receive the honor of knighthood , and became Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	, under which title she still turns out a certain amount of literary work , including the introductions to the recent '' Centenary Biographical Edition '' of her father 's works .

		And , conversely , the son of that famous novelist of our youth ,
Miss Braddon	PERSON	, can employ his very considerable talent without any danger of confusion , since the author of u Lady
Audley	PERSON	's Secret '' still remains faithful in fiction to her maiden name .

		I think the succession of Mr.
W. B. Maxwell	PERSON	and
Miss Braddon	PERSON	is possibly the best example we possess of inherited talent .

		The son seems to appeal to much the same class of reader as his mother , and to have achieved much the same kind of success .

		He is popular , but also is a good craftsman ; there is always thought in his novels , and sometimes they rise to a very high level .

		I consider '' The Guarded Flame '' one of the best books of its sort that have appeared for several years .

		Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	is dis - tinctly good with his women which perhaps may be part of his inheritance .

		He displays sometimes an almost uncanny knowledge of the daily life of shop-girls and governesses and lady companions .

		In his latest book , '' Mrs.
Thompson	PERSON	, '' he has given us an admirable picture of the Woman of Business .

		His men , on the other hand , are usually poor crea - tures by comparison .

		He has thus discovered the formula for the successful novel which is , briefly , to make your feminine interest the stronger . ''

		Lay all your emotional stress upon the woman , '' says the expert ; for women , who are the great novel-readers , like to see their own sex well in the limelight .

		After reading one of Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	's recent novels , I took up again a story of his mother 's , with some idea of seeing whether any family likeness were traceable in the two methods .

		When I remember how the books of Miss
Braddon	PERSON	used to enthral us in our youth , it oppresses me to reflect how time has robbed us of our pristine simplicity .

		The story it was '' Vixen '' affected me with a mild wonder .

		It seemed incredible that our hearts could have thrilled -LRB- as they undoubtedly did -RRB- over the machine - made sufferings of the heroine , the obvious misun - derstandings that delayed the inevitable and happy consummation .

		But on reflection I perceived that it was the manner rather than the matter that now troubled me ; the little tricks of language carry - ing us back to mid - Victorian days , the point of view characteristic of that curiously cramped epoch .

		For as far as mere plot goes , Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	has handled in ''
Vivien	PERSON	'' perhaps the most threadbare of all situations that of the nobleman and the poor governess , and has convincingly demonstrated that anything can be made absorbing provided it is dealt with in the right manner .

		The
Kingsley	PERSON	family , of whom `` Lucas Malet '' is now the chief literary representative , possesses a long and worthy list of writers .

		Charles ,
Henry	PERSON	, and
George	PERSON	, the three brothers , all made their mark in the world of letters .

		There has been a tendency of late years to exalt the author of '' Ravenshoe '' at the expense of the author of '' Westward Ho ! ''

		But as a poet and a writer for children
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	had qualities that will probably keep his name alive when
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	is forgotten .

		George , the third brother , is still remembered for '' South Sea Bubbles , '' a book of travel which he wrote in collaboration with the
Earl of Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is curious that he too had a daughter who carried on the literary tradition Miss
Mary Kingsley	PERSON	, who wrote '' Travels in
West Africa	LOCATION	'' and lectured to several scientific gatherings on the fauna , flora , and folk-lore of that district .

		This talented lady was certainly more '' true to type '' than her more famous cousin , the author of `` Sir
Richard Cal	LOCATION	- mady . ''

		Both the
Cole	PERSON	`` ridges and the Tennysons have contributed several names to the world of letters .

		The former is perhaps the most literary family of them all .

		The old poet , friend of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Southey	PERSON	, had four children , of whom one died young .

		The remaining three ,
Hartley	PERSON	,
Sara	PERSON	, and Derwent , all became well known as authors .


Hartley	PERSON	was a master of the sonnet form , and an exceptionally gifted critic .

		Sara wrote , among other things , '' Phantasmion : A Fairy Tale , '' the songs in which were much admired by
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	and other critics .

		Derwent became a distinguished scholar and author , and left two children ,
Christabel	PERSON	and
Ernest Hartley	PERSON	, the former well known as a novelist , the latter as a critic and writer of biography .

		Then , too , there remain a whole list of nephews and great - nephews , ranging from the late Lord Chief Justice of
England	LOCATION	, whose addresses and papers would fill a substantial volume , to
Arthur Duke Coleridge	PERSON	, author of '' Eton in the Forties , '' and his daughter
Mary E. Coleridge	PERSON	, a well-known writer of fiction who died some four years ago .

Lockhart	LOCATION	after a year 's service ; later , he published an excellent edi - tion of ''
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	's Commentaries , '' and , when a very old man , produced a pleasant '' Memoir of
John Keble	PERSON	. ''

		Against this galaxy of talent , the
Tennyson	PERSON	clan make only a moderate show .

		But it must not be forgotten that the late Laureate 's first volume , '' Poems by Two
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' contained several pieces by his brother
Charles	PERSON	, afterward better known as
Charles Tennyson-Turner	PERSON	, whose `` Century of Son - nets '' still remains a fairly popular gift-book .

		The second peer , and present holder of the title , has , I believe , written verse ; he has certainly been respon - sible for a worthy memoir of his father , in two vol - umes .

		But perhaps the pious duty of compiling a father 's '' Life and Letters '' scarcely comes within the province of pure literature .

		A grandson of the poet , a second
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, had his first novel reviewed recently in the public press .

		Perhaps the celebrated
Darwin	PERSON	family would be more justly considered under the head of science than literature .

		But the dividing line between the two is a thin one , and the earliest member of the race to gain renown combined the two fields in a manner peculiarly his own .

		Probably it was the fashion of the age , rather than any decided poetic inspiration , that induced
Erasmus Darwin	PERSON	, grand - father of the yet more famous
Charles	PERSON	, to couch his '' Botanic Garden '' and '' Loves of the Plants '' in the rhymed heroic couplets of the eighteenth century .

		At heart , he was scientist rather than poet ; but his florid pomp of language no doubt procured him readers who would have left a plain prose statement of his theories severely alone .

		In his '' ZoOnomia '' he anticipated some of the views of
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	.

		His son ,
Robert Waring Darwin	PERSON	, is not reported to have written anything of note ; but his two grandsons ,
Erasmus	PERSON	and
Charles	PERSON	, inherited respectively both his taste for letters and his spirit of scientific specula - tion .

		The author of '' The Origin of Species '' left in his turn four sons , all of whom have done some - thing to maintain the honor of the family .

		The pres - ent Sir
George Darwin	PERSON	is the best known of the four ; he became Professor of Astronomy and Experi - mental Philosophy at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1883	DATE	.

		Coming down again to the present generation , I can recall no instance of a family of authors to compare with the Bensons .

		The three sons of the late Archbishop of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	seem to share in almost equal degree their considerable gift of awakening the public interest .

		They all not only write with ease and a certain distinction , but -LRB- which is more surprising -RRB- , with success .

		It would be difficult for anyone not actually in the trade to say which of the three had the largest circle of readers .

		The author of '' Dodo '' and '' The Vintage '' was the earliest of the brothers to achieve fame , for he wrote the first-mentioned novel at the early age of twenty-five .

		Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, who was until recently a master at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	, was considerably longer on the road to popularity , as was to be expected from a man who began his literary career with poems and essays .

		At the present moment he and Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	are perhaps the only two writers who have succeeded in making the gentle art of essay-writing pay in this country .

		Mr.
R. H. Benson	PERSON	, the third brother , a priest in the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, has specialized with good results in what may be termed the religious novel .

		Of late years the three have produced between them so many books that hardly a list of recent publications can be found that does not contain one of their names .

		The Archbishop himself was a zealous and learned antiquarian , whose '' Cyprian '' would have brought fame to a smaller man .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		DECEPTIVE ILLUSTRATIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The writing of books illustrative of English life in past centuries seems to be a special penchant of
Ameri	LOCATION	- can scholarship to-day .

		During the
last decade	DATE	, for example , quite a dozen volumes have been published , which attempt by copious illustration and citation to throw light upon the ordinary conditions of life in sixteenth-century
England	LOCATION	.

		In many cases it would appear that the pictures generously introduced into all these books have received less careful attention than modern scholarship requires to be given to data pre - sented in writing .

		Pictures illustrating conditions in one century are frequently ascribed to another ; many are so vaguely or erroneously labelled as to convey entire misapprehension ; while in a number of instances purely conjectural modern sketches , sometimes contain - ing obvious impossibilities , are put side by side with genuine contemporary illustrations , without any kind of discrimination or warning .

		In other words , in the im - portant matter of illustration the compilers of books on social and literary history often show themselves several generations behind the ordinary standards of present - day learning in accuracy and candor .

		Has not the time come to demand that the pictures introduced into works on social and cultural conditions be subjected to the same investigation which is given to other testimony , that each be clearly and precisely labelled , and that those which have genuine value as contemporary evidence be definitely distinguished from the great number of more or less imaginary fabrica - tions ?

		Several very glaring examples of carelessness in selecting and explaining illustrations occur in
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his Forerunners , '' published by
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Company	ORGANIZATION	in
1902	DATE	.

		Inasmuch as the work appeared posthumously ,
Lanier	PERSON	can not himself be burdened with the misconduct of the person who seems quite recklessly to have brought together the numerous pictures .

		However , the mottoes which accompany these pictures occasionally involve such not - able blunders as inevitably to reflect discredit upon the entire book .

		On pp. 98f .

		of the second volume , Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	has some rational observations on the shape and 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, dramatic use of the Tudor inn-yard .

		At this point the illustrator has inserted a cut of what he terms an '' Old Inn showing Courtyard in which Plays were performed . ''

		This picture , however , instead of representing an
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan tavern , is in reality a reproduction of the eight - eenth century coaching inn of the '' Bull and Mouth , '' Aldersgate Street .

		The same view appears , accurately entitled , in Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , and an account of the '' Bull and Mouth '' -LRB- '' Boulogne Mouth '' -RRB- can be found in
Thornberry	PERSON	's '' Old and
New London	LOCATION	, '' ii. , 219 .

		The absurdity of palming off this late eighteenth or early nineteenth century scene as a genuine representation of the sixteenth-century inn-yard used for plays must be obvious to all who glance at the high post-chaises , the piles of trunks on the ground , and the tall hats , pigeon-tailed coats , and long trousers of the travellers .

		These clear evidences of date are , fur - thermore , supplemented by the tell-tale legend '' Coffee Room '' over a door in the left foreground .

		The drink - ing of coffee was not introduced commonly till a century after the time which the picture purports to illustrate ; and the word '' coffee-room , '' first instanced in the New English Dictionary from `` The Spectator , ''
1712	DATE	, can hardly have been applied to a special room in a coaching - inn before the close of the eighteenth century .

		Apart from the critical offence involved , serious misconception must arise from thus presenting a comparatively modern picture as illustrative of conditions at least two centuries earlier .

		The inn-yard portrayed , though containing several interior galleries , is entirely different in shape from its small rectangular predecessors of the Tudor era , and could never have been employed practically for dramatic presentation .

		Many similar examples of inaccurate or misleading illustration can be found in the two volumes of this same book .

		No serious objection should perhaps be urged against the reproduction of a picture called '' An Early English Mystery Play '' -LRB- vol .

		i. , p. 298 -RRB- from
Thomas Sharp	PERSON	's '' Dissertation on the
Coventry Mysteries	ORGANIZATION	, ''
1825	DATE	.

		However , one might reasonably expect some warning as to the entirely conjectural nature of this sketch , which Sharp states to have been drawn to his order , at the beginning of the nineteenth century , according to what he imagined to have been fifteenth century conditions .

		A couple of pages previous -LRB- vol .

		i. , p. 296 -RRB- there appears a picture entitled '' An Early English Puppet Theatre .

		From a 14th-century MS. '' The manuscript referred to is in the Bodleian -LRB-
MS. Bodl	LOCATION	.

		264 -RRB- , and the picture in question was first reproduced by
M. Jusserand	PERSON	in the '' Furnivall Miscellany '' volume , published the year before Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	's book -LRB-
1901	DATE	-RRB- .

		M. Jusserand explains this picture , and another from the same manuscript , as illustrating a fourteenth - century pageant with real actors ; and there seems no doubt that he is right when we find by referring to
M. Charles Magnin	PERSON	's '' Histoire des Marionnettes en
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	, 1862 -RRB- , that puppet theatres are entirely unrecorded in
England	LOCATION	, as well as in
France	LOCATION	, till two centuries after the date of the manuscript containing the picture .

		The reader who casually turns over the pictures in Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	's book will probably have his attention drawn , even before he has noticed any of the errors just mentioned , to what pretends to be a reproduction of the '' Title-page of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's Tragedies and Comedies '' -LRB- vol .

		ii. , p. 148 -RRB- .

		Here , instead of finding a facsimile from the well-known 1616 Folio of
Jonson	PERSON	, one reads with astonishment : '' Tragedies and Comedies collected into one volume .

		The picture , of course , repro - duces the first page of the earliest anonymous impression of
John Marston	PERSON	's works , as the specific list of contents sufficiently shows .

		The hasty collector of pictures for Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	's book has presumably leaped to the startling conclusion that the '' Tragedies and Comedies '' men - tioned were the work of
Jonson	LOCATION	, because some one has written in ink across the particular copy of the title-page photographed the words `` Ben :
Jonson	PERSON	. ''

		This scrawl may evidence the honest delusion of some seventeenth century possessor of the volume , but surely it is deplor - able that so transparent a blunder should be given cir - culation and support in a reputable modern work .

		Unsigned manuscript notes on title-pages and fly - leaves of early books are notoriously untrustworthy .

		Yet such annotations on pictures are often accepted without any investigation .

		The
Lanier	PERSON	book repeats soberly , under a sketch of a man with drum and tabor -LRB- vol .

		ii , p. 144 -RRB- , the description written in an eighteenth century hand , '' Richd :
Tarleton	LOCATION	.

		Actor in Shakesperes Plays . ''

		It is probable that the picture does represent a sketch of
Tarleton	LOCATION	; but no serious writer would to-day refer to
Tarleton	LOCATION	, who died in
1588	DATE	, as an actor in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , in the absence of any scrap of evidence , and in view of the fact that the poet 's first independent play , '' Love 's Labor 's Lost , '' is now almost universally dated later than
1590	DATE	.

		It is perhaps not unpermissible to dwell at length upon these particular inaccuracies , because they seem to illustrate , with no very excessive exaggeration , a prevalent vice of the day .

		The rage for illustration has passed from the .

		magazine to the serious text-book ; and it is yet little realized , apparently , that pictures irres - ponsibly selected , and inserted without adequate investi - gation , can easily lead to more serious misapprehension than would result from glaring error in the letter-press .

		A REVIVAL OF LEARNING IN
ICELAND	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At first blush it would seem an ill-advised undertak - ing to found a real university on an island so remote , so sparsely settled , so poor , as
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , even a member of the Althing -LRB- the Icelandic Parliament -RRB- branded the project as a '' bloodless idea '' as late as
1891	DATE	.

		And more than once the Danish overlord re - jected resolutions looking in that direction for what were thought adequate reasons .

		Yet at a nearer examination , the fervid wish of many Icelanders for a truly national institution of higher learn - ing which wish has now become realized proves to be far from unreasonable .

		In a very real way it means to them the beginning of a renascence which will , it is fondly hoped , bring
Iceland	LOCATION	once more to the forefront among cultured nations .

		The Icelanders , to a man , are ever conscious of the proud fact that it was their fore - fathers who gave the Ed da to the world ; who created the Saga literature , the only purely Germanic literature to be reckoned with seriously ; who founded the first republic of modern times altogether independent of classical influence .

		In the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	,
Iceland	LOCATION	was well supplied with

		THE DIAI , 247 cloisters in which the torch of native learning and litera - ture burned brightly , whilst a remarkable tolerance per - mitted the spirit of ancient Heathendom once more to express itself fully before succumbing altogether to Christianity .

		With its subjugation under
Norway	LOCATION	, in the middle of the thirteenth century , the lamentable downfall of the erstwhile wealthy and powerful island may be said to have begun .

		Wrongful monopolies sucking the life-blood of the country , terrible volcanic eruptions , earthquakes , floods , together with the repeated fearful visitations of the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	, well-nigh ruined the laud and reduced the population to misery and despair .

		The island , which is calculated to have had a hundred thousand inhabitants during its palmy days , at the beginning of the last century counted but a score of thousands of poverty-stricken cotters and fishermen .

		But the love of learning had never quite died out among the people .

		At the very first meeting of the Althing , after a separate constitution had been granted to the island in
1845	DATE	, their aspirations were voiced in a petition , handed in by Icelandic students in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, that provision for higher public instruction should forth - with be made .

		The first result of this demand was the
Clerical Seminary	ORGANIZATION	at
Reykjavik	LOCATION	, founded in
1847	DATE	.

		Harder still it was to obtain the consent of the Danish government for the establishment of a Medical School -LRB- 1876 -RRB- .

		Even more difficult it proved to found a Law School .

		Bills looking in that direction were killed , time and again , in the legislature for almost half a century ; and when finally passed they were promptly vetoed by the king , until the royal sanction was at last obtained in
1904	DATE	.

		The founding of a real University was not seriously considered until
1891	DATE	, and again in
1893	DATE	, when a bill for it was passed by ^ both divisions of the Althing , but was vetoed by
King Christian XI	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , conditions then were as yet scarcely advanced enough to justify the step .

		The matter was not publicly broached again for a number of years ; but public-spirited men and women kept the cause alive , even collecting some little money for the purpose .

		In due time -LRB-
1907	DATE	-RRB- , the legis - lature passed a resolution instructing the Government to appoint a commission to work out plans for establish - ing a University of four faculties , to be substituted for the professional schools already existing .

		Accordingly , this committee reported at the next session of the Althing -LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- , recommending a constitution based , in its chief features , on the
Norwegian University	ORGANIZATION	regula - tions of
1905	DATE	, which resemble those of the typical Con - tinental universities .

		Excepting for minor changes , this was adopted and made a law on
July 30 , 1909	DATE	,
Iceland	LOCATION	having meanwhile become practically autonomous as to its internal affairs .

		A more unpretentious , not to say insignificant , begin - ning could hardly be imagined .

		The yearly appropria - tion for the newly-fledged university was scarcely
$ 15,000	MONEY	a sum which will , however , with rigid econ - omy , and in
Iceland	LOCATION	, go ten times as far as with us .

		There will be two full professors and one docent in the department of Theology , two professors in the Law school , two professors and six special instructors in Medicine , two professors in the historical-philological department .

		Instruction is , of course , given only to graduates of a '' gymnasium , '' whose number is hardly expected to be more than a few score for the present .

		To start with , the institution will be housed in the spa - cious upper stories of the
Public School	ORGANIZATION	at the capital ,
Reykjavik	LOCATION	.

		In honor of J < 5n
Sigurdsson	PERSON	, it was decided to make the formal opening coincide with the hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Iceland	LOCATION	's greatest son of modern times -LRB- born
June 17 , 1811	DATE	, died
Dec. 7 , 1879	DATE	-RRB- , who is fondly called the
Gladstone	PERSON	of
Iceland	LOCATION	, and , indeed , shared with the English statesman his nobility of character , his enormous industry , and his astonishing versatility .

		Historian , philologist , publicist , economist , he left works of enduring value in each of these fields ; but by far his greatest monument is the successful con - duct of the long constitutional struggle with
Denmark	LOCATION	which resulted in practically complete independence .

		On
June 17	DATE	his memory was honored in the simple yet impressive ceremonies marking the commencement of the
Hdskoli Islands	LOCATION	. ''

		In his inaugural address , Rector
Bjorn M. Olsen	PERSON	, the distinguished philologist , dwelt on the peculiar national mission of the new institution .

		Its chief est call , he thinks , is to inspire and rejuvenate his small but historic nation , to give it heart in its hard struggle for its right - ful place among modern communities .

		It is to be the focus in which are concentrated the rays of culture from the great outer world , and its function will be to distri - bute them again among the people .

		To the native student it will furnish instruction in branches which were taught indifferently , if at all , at
Copenhagen	LOCATION	; in Icelandic law -LRB- which shows many features peculiarly its own -RRB- ; and in medicine and surgery , as adapted to the peculiar conditions of their practice on the island .

		It is also hoped that a modest number of foreign students will avail themselves of the unique opportunity to learn '' on the spot , '' Icelandic history , language , and litera - ture , under acknowledged authorities .

		To the Icelanders themselves , however , it is not to act like a Chinese wall , still further shutting them off from cultural inter - course with the world , as opponents of the project had feared , but rather as an effective mediator with it .

		His standards of official duty were rigid and hard to reach , and his pen was severe against failure to come up to the mark .

		And yet he strove always to be just .

		A first unfavorable impression with him never meant absolute and irreversible condemnation , as it often does with a class of men whose harshness of speech might seem to the superficial observer to stamp them as closely akin to him .

		We may take as an instance his feeling toward General
McClellan	PERSON	.

		Almost alone at the start he questioned Mc -
Clellan	PERSON	's fitness for the important work to which he was called ; and yet it was he who in
1862	DATE	thwarted the attempt of Secretary Chase to secure from the cabinet a united statement to the President denouncing the General in violent terms for incapacity , pronouncing him a traitor , and demanding his removal .

		Harsh though he was , he had a stern sense of justice , and insight to recognize such good qualities as did exist in the various objects of his animad - versions ; and , still more , he had a good measure of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's power to see that it was often better to get along with imperfect instruments than to make changes the effect of which upon an ex - cited and poorly informed public opinion might result in serious harm .

		His connection with
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	began with very untoward omens .

		On the evening of Inauguration Day ,
1865	DATE	, he writes : '' The Vice-President made a * THE DIARY OF GIDEON WELLES .

		With an Introduc - tion by
John T. Morse	PERSON	, Jr. .

		rambling and strange harangue , which was listened to with pain and mortification by all his friends .

		My impressions were that he was under the influence of stimulants , yet I know not that he drinks . ''

		His impression as to the cause of
Johnson	PERSON	's muddled speech was soon confirmed ; and yet in the end Secretary
Welles	PERSON	was to become one of
Johnson	PERSON	's most loyal and unflinching supporters throughout the whole of his stormy and unpopular administration .

		We can do no better here than to quote a paragraph from Mr.
John T. Morse	PERSON	's Introduction to the Diary . ''

		The picture of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	is altogether the most favorable which has ever been given , at least with any authority , of that unfortunate man .

		It de - serves to be studied with great interest , for , as has been said , Mr.
Welles	PERSON	was a very shrewd and very fair judge of men .

		He had a high esteem for
Johnson	PERSON	, which was not only the loyalty of an office-holder towards his chief , but was also a sincere esteem and genuine personal liking .

		It is safe to assume that the excited partisanship of the times somewhat stimulated these sentiments ; yet he was not thus prevented from often criticizing his leader , and he seems in the main even-minded and judicious .

		It may be that the publi - cation of these volumes will lead to at least a partial revision of popular opinion concerning our only im - peached President . ''

		In Grant , Mr.
Welles	PERSON	saw early , what all but blind partisans were to see later on , the ease with which he could be entangled and used by dishonest schemers : the failing so aptly put by
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	in the last lines to come from his pen : '' Yet did this man , war tempered , stern as steel Where steel opposed , prove soft in civil sway ; The hand hilt-hardened had lost tact to feel The world 's base coin , and glozing knaves made prey Of him and of the entrusted
Commonweal	LOCATION	. ''

		During the Summer of 1867 Mr.
Welles	PERSON	wrote in his Diary : `` General Grant has become severely afflicted with the Presidential disease , and it warps his judgment , which is not very intelligent or enlightened at best .

		He is less sound on great and fundamental principles , vastly less informed than I had supposed possible for a man of his opportunities .

		Obviously , he has been tampered with and flattered by the Radicals , who are using him and his name for their selfish and partisan purposes . ''

		The attitude of Mr.
Welles	PERSON	toward
Seward	PERSON	was expressed in a time-softened manner in
1873	DATE	, when he published a little volume on Lincoln and
Seward	PERSON	, in reply to an address on
Seward	ORGANIZATION	by
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, wherein the orator had attributed to Secretary
Seward	PERSON	about all that was most worthy of credit in the
Lincoln	LOCATION	administration .

		In general , the publi - cations of more recent years have tended to strip
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 Seward of much of his glory in the popular imagination ; and this Diary militates power - fully in the same direction .

		That
Seward	PERSON	was offensively and harmfully meddlesome in mat - ters over which he had no jurisdiction and con - cerning which he was woefully ignorant , is shown again and again ; and if anything in the Diary tends toward a lower estimate of Lincoln than is generally held since
Morse	PERSON	's great biography and other books of recent years , it is the proof of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's too-frequent yielding to
Seward	ORGANIZATION	as against more honest and competent advisers .

		Welles wrote : '' There has been an itching propensity on his part to have a controlling voice in naval matters with which he has no business and which he really does not under - stand ; and he sometimes improperly interferes , as in the disposition of mails on captured vessels .

		The Attorney - General has experienced similar improper interference , more than any other ; perhaps none are exempt .

		But the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, while meddlesome with others , is not at all communicative of the affairs of his own department . ''

		Secretary
Welles	PERSON	was in sentiment one of the original
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	reformers , and stubbornly fought for his views on various occasions , as when the whole
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	management was about to be upset because of the resistance of some of the better-minded officers to the de - mand for enforced political assessments .

		Again and again the Secretary records his disgust with Senators and Representatives who overwhelmed him with demands for places for their political henchmen , in spite of obvious unfitness for the work to be done in the positions sought .

		In the case of one attempt to seize upon the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	for political ends , he writes of a visit to his office by the son of Secretary
Seward	PERSON	, with certain papers : '' In these papers a party committee propose to take the organization of the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	into their keeping , to name the Commandant , to remove the Naval Con - structor , to change the regulations , and make the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	a party machine for the benefit of party , and to employ men to elect candidates , instead of building ships .

		I am amazed that
Raymond	PERSON	-LSB- Editor of the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	' -RSB- could debase himself so far as to submit such a proposition , and more that he expects me to enforce it . ''

		An amusing reference to some remarks of Lincoln is appropriate here : '' The President was happy .

		Says he is amused with the manners and views of some who address him , who tell him that he is now reflected and can do just as he has a mind to , which means that he can do some un - worthy thing that the person who addresses him has a mind to .

		There is very much of this . ''

		Secretary Welles saw clearly the quagmire into which unwise currency measures were lead - ing the country .

		In
February of 1864	DATE	he wrote : '' Had a brief talk to-day with
Chase on Financial	ORGANIZATION	matters .

		He seems embarrassed how to proceed , but being futile in resources is listening to others still more futile .

		There will , however , come a day of reckoning , and
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	will have to pay for all these expedients .

		In departing from the specie standard and making irre - deemable paper its equivalent , I think a great error was committed .

		By inflating the currency , loans have been more easily taken , but the artificial prices are ruin - ous .

		I do not gather from Chase that he has any sys - tem or fixed principles to govern him in his managemen of the treasury . ''

		The manner in which the negroes were granted the suffrage was severely condemned by Secretary Welles . ''

		This whole question of suffrage is much abused .

		The Negro can take upon himself the duty about as intelligently , and as well for the public interest , as a considerable portion of the foreign element which comes amongst us .

		Each will be the tool of the demagogues .

		If the Negro is to vote and exercise the duties of a citizen , let him be educated to it .

		The measure should not , even if the government were empowered to act , be precipitated when he is stolidly ignorant and wholly unprepared .

		It is proposed to do it against what have been and still are the constitutions , laws , usages , and practices of the
States	LOCATION	which we wish to restore to fellowship . ''

		But party gain , apparently within reach , was a stronger motive than sober judgment .

		The temper of the present day , not very regardful of abstractions concerning human rights , may possibly overestimate the harm done by Negro suffrage , but few will deny that the way in which that suffrage was perverted by selfishly partisan white leaders was harmful and debasing in the highest degree , and probably the majority of the most sincere friends of the
Negro	ORGANIZATION	would now agree that it would have been better for him and for all if the gift had been bestowed gradually , as a fixed standard , not high enough to have been essentially out of reach , should be attained .

		There is no chapter of this Diary that is not replete with interest .

		Intelligent comment on some important question yields only to criticism of some incompetent , overbearing , or corrupt politician , always too biting in its expression to be dull , and always with some little touch of originality , even if , as in the case of
Seward	LOCATION	, the last has been applied so often that the count is as hopelessly lost as Catullus wanted it to be with
Lesbia	PERSON	's kisses .

		The student of American history must read these volumes ; the general reader certainly will do so , if once he discovers their quality .

		To the careful student , aware of what has been written during the
past quarter	DATE	- century , they will not in many points be subver - sive of estimates of men and events already entertained .

		Secretary Welles saw at the start much that it has taken a generation of patient 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, scholarship to work out bit by bit .

		This Diary gives a good test of the accuracy of the work which our historical investigators have been doing on the period of the Civil War and Recon - struction , and in general the result of that test is favorable .

		As Mr.
Morse	PERSON	puts it in his Intro - duction : `` There is a remarkable agreement between what he wrote in those days when our past was his present , and what our historians and biographers are now setting forth as the dispassionate valuations of posterity .

		Such harmony is agreeably reassuring as to the ac - curacy of the judgments which we are today accepting . ''

		THE STORY OF THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM .

		* It is natural to assume that the history of the college curriculum would make a dull story .

		Professor
William T. Foster	PERSON	, now President of the newly founded
Reed College	ORGANIZATION	at
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, has shown that it may be made distinctly interesting and profitable withal .

		His book is equally strong on the critical and constructive as on the historical side .

		It presents an admir - able statement of the growth , significance , and future problems of the elective system and of the allied interests of the college curriculum .

		As a result of the survey , it becomes clearer than ever that the spirit of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	gave the distinctive trend to much that we properly and proudly call American in modern education .

		We may be surprised to learn that
Jefferson	PERSON	urged '' the first President of the Re - public to support his astounding scheme for uprooting the entire faculty of the academy of
Geneva	LOCATION	and planting it in the
State of Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		But we soon realize that the fundamental convic - tion that a newer institution could alone express the needs of the newer community was certain to bear fruit in one way if not in another .


Jefferson	PERSON	was the founder of the elective system ; and its alma mater was
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is well that Mr.
Foster	PERSON	has so convincingly shown that the credit belongs here ; and that the men who by their contact with German institutions are commonly associated with the early begin - nings of the movement at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	and
Everett	PERSON	-RRB- , in so far as they were not in reality opposed to the system , owed their more favorable attitude to
Jefferson	LOCATION	.

		It is quite im - possible for us at this day to realize the utter * ADMINISTRATION OF THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM .

		By
William T. Foster	PERSON	, President of
Reed College	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Hough ton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		barrenness of the old cut-and-dried system and its complete want of relationship with the pro- gressive thinking that was moving the minds of the
early nineteenth century	DATE	and of later days .

		Moreover , the detailed struggle in the older colleges for some slight recognition of modern thought , language , and science ; the chary con - cessions grudingly allowed ; the tariff of a less credit imposed on elective studies ; and a host of devices to protect the prestige of traditional scholarship , all these present a quaint appear - ance to retrospective vision , like the mental costumes of bygone days .

		The same applies to the incident in the
' 40	DATE	's at
Harvard	LOCATION	, when the Faculty voted that no student shall pursue more than one modern language at a time , and Pro- fessor
Longfellow	LOCATION	protested , but was unable to persuade the Corporation to set aside the ruling of the Faculty .

		It would be wrong to suppose that any very perverse myopia of the Faculties , or any unconscious lodgment of motes , limited or obscured their vision .

		There seem to have been at all periods progressive groups of men sedate insurgents , if you please who were thinking freely and deeply on the problem of the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Amherst	LOCATION	Report of
1826	DATE	is indeed a notable and inspiring document .

		To us it rings with conviction ; but it failed to find a sufficient support for practical embodiment . ''

		Human nature seems to have decreed that the history of education shall be one long record of clear conceptions of needs a generation in advance of their realization . ''

		The later evolution of the curriculum under the impetus of the elective system which Presi - dent Eliot vitalized , is more familiar .

		The latest reaction against its too exclusive absorption of the curriculum , and against the abuses which it encouraged , resulted in the revision of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	rules as almost the first action of Presi - dent
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's regime .

		At this stage the matter becomes one for expert diagnosis ; and doctors will continue to agree or disagree according to their training and temperament .

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	brings the discussion down to the present , and , while urging his own position , presents the case fairly .

		At this stage the politics of education replaces its history .

		Educational '' shop '' has a larger justifica - tion than the technical business of many profes - sions ; for those in training for all sorts and conditions of vocations are exposed to its pro- cedures .

		The present endeavor is directed to providing efficient concentration together with a broadening diffusion of interests . ''

		Thou shalt know much of one thing , '' '' Thou shalt know
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 somewhat of many things , '' and '' Thou shalt choose what thou wilt know , '' seem to be the chief of the commandments , and the rest are like unto them .

		How this reasonable desider - atum is to be encouraged is well set forth in these pages ; and the argument makes a plea for the value of statistical investigation to replace guess-work and impressionism .

		That success in college bears a reasonable relation to success in life may be statistically established .

		Systems and innovations may be so weighed in the educa - tional balance as in due season to be certified as full weight or found wanting .

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	's constructive proposals urge the recognition of quality along with quantity of work .

		Yet such is the human -LRB- including pro- fessorial -RRB- frailty that any such premium will be adjusted to favor the professed domain of each professor .

		Hence a scientific marking system must be introduced that shall at once rate the student and disclose the personal equation of the instructor with the brutal disregard attach - ing to '' probable errors '' and curves of distri - bution .

		All this belongs to the shop ; it is worth careful consideration by those of the profession , who will promptly find its limitations and short - comings .

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	is aware of these , and aware also of the fact that the salvation to be looked for in methods is most imperfect , is in - deed not vital .

		Yet machinery we must have ; and those who run it should have a large sense of the why and the wherefore of its working and the qualities demanded of the product .

		A more general interest attaches to the con - cluding chapter discussing `` Our Democratic American College . ''

		The reading thereof will not add to one 's complacency .

		The College is the object of severe criticism , some of it just and wholesome , some of it carping , some of it misleading though outspoken , some of it mis - leading because too discreetly reticent and cir - cumspect .

		Above the confusion of fault-find - ing in itself a welcome relief from the vapidity of Boeotian laudation a resounding note makes itself heard , the false commercial standards and appraisals of college life .

		The bid for numbers , the advertising of athletics and other side-shows , the coddling of the lame , the halt , and the blind , the cavalierly student attitude toward scholar - ship , the distorted appraisal of professorial qualities and activities , may all be presented as variations of a common theme .

		It may be a trite and a prosaic one ; unfortunately , the American public has still to learn how to listen to it .

		Frank diagnosis does not exclude hopeful prognosis .

		President Foster closes his chapter with an optimistic forecast of the ideal College , not in terms of a Utopia but as a realizable possibility .

		What may be the most serious criticism of all is not touched upon .

		There are many , very many , of those responsibly connected with the academic life who agree with the prevailing strictures of the American college .

		Why do they not assert themselves ?

		Why do they aid and abet what at bottom fails to command their sincere sympathy , their best enthusiasm , their deepest loyalty ?

		There must be some singleness of cause for so many related symptoms .

		As yet , those who refer it to the unwise domination of the administrative organization within the col - lege have presented the strongest brief .

		These things are vital ; the curriculum is secondary thereto .

		College politics must give way to col - lege statesmanship .

		Such a book as this is a helpful and hopeful contribution to the cam - paign literature .

		JogEpH J ASTROW > FIRST IMPRESSIONS or A MOUNTAIN LOVER .

		* As a revelation of '' the glory and freedom of the out-of-doors '' exemplified in the
Sierra Nevada Mountains	LOCATION	in and about the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	, Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's narrative of his first impres - sions in those regions is most charming and re - freshing .

		It takes the reader by dusty trails into forest fastnesses of sugar pine , incense cedar , and giant redwood , along purling brooks and mountain torrents , through tangles of bracken and azalea , and across mountain meadows aglow with a thousand blossoms , to the precipice 's brink , and up to fields of perpetual snow , and to the rugged crags of the backbone of the continent .

		Even more satisfying than the painstaking and often rather elaborate descriptions of forest trees , of shrubs of the chaparral and chamisal , and of the flowers of the sunny slopes and wet meadows , are the personal glimpses of the lover of trees and of blossoms which this narrative reveals . ''

		I sat a long time beneath the tallest fronds , and never enjoyed anything in the nature of a bower of wild leaves more strangely impressive .

		Only spread a fern frond over a man 's head , and worldly cares are cast out , and freedom and beauty and peace come in .

Nature	ORGANIZATION	's hand , every devout mountaineer knows its power ; but the marvellous beauty value of what the Scotch call a breckan in a still dell , what poet has sung this ?

		It would seem impossible that anyone , however incrusted with care , could escape the Godf ul influence of these sacred fern forests . ''

		His pages are all brim-full of the glowing enthusiasm of youth and the exhilara - tion of first impressions of the wonders of the mountains .

		Yet withal it was a humble errand that took this poet - wanderer to the brink of the Yosemite that of sharing with
Billy	PERSON	-LRB- the shepherd -RRB- the care of two thousand sheep , the '' hoofed locusts '' whose busy nibbling strips the moun - tain side or forest floor of every trace of edible verdure .

		Stupid animals too , balking at every brook till pressed into the flood by men and dogs , or madly plunging in to return to the rest of the flock after having been carried across in the vain hope that the others might follow .

		The loneliness and monotony of the shepherd 's life that have brought many a herder to the madhouse , gave to our author the chance to acquaint himself with the flowers and trees , with the wild animals of the forests and moun - tains , and to explore lakes , snowfields , and mountain peaks , and even to drop down into the desert beyond the range to crater-nestling Mono Lake with its Indian village .

		It was little sympathy or comradeship that could be had from
Shepherd Billy	ORGANIZATION	, a soul befogged beneath mean pleasures and cares , who declined to walk a mile to the brink of the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	to see a '' hole in the ground . ''

		So the author turned to his faithful dog Carlo , to the sheep , the bears , squirrels , marmots , chipmucks , yes , even to the lizards , ants , and grasshoppers ; and found in these an unfailing source of interest and companionship in the solitude of the wilderness .

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's first impressions of the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	will keenly interest all those whose own eyes have caught that never-to-be-forgotten first glimpse into this superb chasm with its roaring cataracts and peaceful valley . ''

		I came at length to the brow of that massive cliff that stands between
Indian Canon	ORGANIZATION	and Yosemite Falls , and here the far-famed valley came suddenly into view throughout almost its whole extent .

		The noble walls sculptured into endless variety of domes and gables , spires and battlements and plain mural precipices all a-tremble with the thunder tones of the falling water .

		The level bottom seemed to be dressed like a garden , sunny meadows here and there , and groves of pine and oak ; the river of Mercy sweeping in majesty through the midst of them and flashing back the sunbeams .

		The great Tissiack , or Half - Dome , rising at the upper end of the valley to a height of nearly a mile , is nobly propor - tioned and life-like , the most impressive of all the rocks , holding the eye in devout admiration , calling it back again and again from falls or meadows , or even the mountains beyond , marvellous cliffs , marvellous in sheer dizzy depth and sculpture , types of endurance . ''

		The blithe and venturesome spirit of the writer and his bubbling enthusiasm over each new tree or flower , his apostrophes to brook and water-fall , to the sunrise and the sunset , to the cloudless
summer	DATE	days , to the passing storm , might become wearisome were they not so sin - cerely genuine .

		They afford enticing glimpses into
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's Wonderland to those who have not been there , and will stir many fond recol - lections in the hearts of those who have '' sum - mered in the Sierras . '' ''

		Here ends my forever memorable first High Sierra excursion .

		I have crossed the
Range of Light	ORGANIZATION	, surely the brightest and best of all the Lord has built ; and rejoicing in its glory , I gladly , gratefully , hopefully pray I may see it again . ''

		As President of the
Sierra Club	ORGANIZATION	,
California	LOCATION	's band of lovers of the mountains and devotees of the out-of-door world , Mr.
Muir	PERSON	has not only visited the mountains again and again , but he has inspired hundreds of others with an enthusiasm for the forest glades , glistening snowfields , and towering peaks of our high
Sierras	LOCATION	.

		He has also led a valiant and successful fight for the preser - vation of these playgrounds for a sturdy and virile race .

		The American people will some day come to utilize and enjoy this heritage of which they now know all too little and which they value too lightly .

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's book will surely do a service in adding to the numbers of those who will know and love these American Alps and be watchful and ready to protect their treasures against the assaults of commercial greed and the irreparable damage by axe and fire which in a few short years can sweep away forever the forest growths of centuries , aye of thousands of years , and replace the great trees and the water - falls with a desert and a turbid but evanescent flood .

		The book is illustrated with numerous cuts from pencil-sketches made in the author 's note - book long ago , and many well-chosen plates from photographs by Mr.

		THE DIAL 253 THE NEW VOICE OF PHILOSOPHY .

		* Philosophy itself has undergone an evolution not unlike that of some genus of animals .

		At one moment , having before us the records of the past , we are astonished at the antiquity of its fundamental ideas , and even the little details of the patterns with which these are embroidered .

		Just as we have concluded that there is nothing new under the sun , we find ourselves projected into a fresh atmosphere , where everything is transformed .

		Philosophy has suffered a muta - tion ; and whether we regard the phenomenon as merely kaleidoscopic or not , for us there is a fresh outlook , and old things have new meanings .

		While the majority of academic philosophers have been content to reiterate -LRB- as
William James	PERSON	put it -RRB- , '' what dusty-minded professors have written about what other previous professors have thought , '' an occasional individual , with more originality and in dependence , has ventured on a new path .

		It is comparatively easy to be original if one does not mind being absurd , and departures from the beaten track have so gen - erally resulted in disaster that the orthodox have repeatedly felt confirmed in their belief that everything worth while was known to the ancients . ''

		Favorable variations '' are those which are adapted to some features in the ex - isting environment arrangements which set up new partnerships , as it were , in the com - merce of life .

		They represent purposeful orig - inality , or what comes to the same thing in its practical outcome .

		Philosophy has found new opportunities of this sort in the development of modern sciences , while science itself has in - creasingly felt the need of philosophical inter - pretation .

		The way has therefore been open for the man of genius who could unite the loose ends of current knowledge and thought , and weave them into useable strands after a manner of his own .

		Such '' purposeful originality '' was exhibited by
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, who was pro- tected by a happy combination of ignorance of tradition and natural independence from falling into the deep-worn ruts of his predecessors .

		The ponderous outcome , criticizable as it may be , had a tremendous influence , and will always remain a great example of philosophic thought taking its roots in science .

		Bergson is as different from
Spencer	PERSON	as well may be , and yet resembles him in going to the science of his day for data , and striving to build up a scheme which shal -RSB- equally interpret and be interpreted by the re - * CREATIVE EVOLUTION .

		ults of observation and experiment .

		It is for this reason that '' L'Evolution Creatrice , '' or ts English translation , may already be seen in 3iological laboratories everywhere , and has be - some a common subject of conversation among naturalists who take little interest in the rami - ications of orthodox philosophy .

		Reviewers have agreed in praising
Bergson	PERSON	's pellucid style , and justly so ; yet a very able scientific man , an ardent Bergsonian , has said that he read the book five times before he fully understood it .

		Such a book is like a well - ordered museum , in which everything is prop - erly exhibited and labelled , but the mind can not appreciate the details at a single visit .

		In a cer - tain sense , no reader can be said to fully under - stand a book like this , if only for the reason that he is not the author .

		We may even press the point further , and remark that the author himself is hazy on certain points as , indeed , he freely confesses .

		The very character of the work , which makes it so stimulating , results largely from the fact that it represents a striv - ing toward that which is not accomplished .

		The very essence of the Bergsonian doctrine , as indicated by the title of the book , is that true evolution is creative , having indeed impulses and directions which may readily be observed , but naive , unforseeable in the details of its future operations .

		Past life , as we view it from the present , seems like a picture painted on a canvas ; but we are not to conceive that all future life is also painted there , only invisible because the canvas is rolled up .

		The intellect naturally adopts a mechanical point of view , because man is a tool-making animal , and the principal use of his mind is to aid his hand in fashioning objects for his use .

		The mind is adapted for dealing with things , with concrete objects , with segregated phenomena .

		Though we per - ceive the flow of evolution , it is in the manner of the cinematograph , which produces apparent movement by rapidly superimposing a series of motionless figures .

		Science chops up reality into little blocks , which it then treats as separate entities .

		It is willing to chop ever finer , as the refinement of its methods increases ; but always , of necessity , it deals with '' things '' or '' phe - nomena . ''

		Now , says
Bergson	PERSON	, all this is inevi - table and desirable , equally from the nature of man and the necessities of his existence .

		We have no quarrel with science or with mechan - ism , except to this extent : that we must insist that they represent only one way , and that a specialized way , of determining truth .

		Man is the outcome of a long evolutional history , in 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, which he has become what he is , not only by developing greatly in certain directions , but also by throwing many things overboard .

		The apparatus with which we judge the universe was not designed , as it were , for that purpose , but for a comparatively restricted and special one .

		Our master key , as we have supposed it , will not open every door .

		Little reflection , and a very moderate knowledge of animal life , suffices to convince us of the truth of this con - tention ; but the question naturally arises , what can we do about it ?

		Made as we are , we must be what we are , and the intellect can not tran - scend itself .

		Bergson escapes from this impo - tent conclusion by considering that , after all , we are not purely intellectual beings .

		In a study of comparative psychology , it appears that intel - lect and instinct are not stages of one and the same thing , but different things .

		The begin - nings of instinct are scarcely to be distinguished from the ordinary life processes of the animals exhibiting them .

		They arise out of and are con - current with those processes which are in fact continuous , not cut up into `` phenomena '' as we artificially see them in our laboratories .

		The outcome of instinct in its higher developments is intuition , which is regarded by
Bergson	PERSON	not as a sort of incoherent intellectual phenomenon , but as something quite else , the fruition of another faculty .

		Of necessity guided in our thinking by our intellects , we possess at the same time the intuitive faculty , which is close to life and flows with it .

		Through it we may become conscious of truth which would never be apprehended by the intellect alone .

		Hence the paradox of life , the continually felt obliga - tion to do and believe things which science and logic can not justify .

		How large a part this non-intellectual element plays in our lives is evident when we think of the emotions which make life worth living .


Bergson	PERSON	speculates on the possibility that there might have existed beings similar to ourselves , but almost or quite wholly guided by instinct or intuition ; com - munities so constituted would certainly be more orderly and contented , as witness the ants .

		It is also questioned whether the two faculties might have been equally highly developed , but it is suggested that the great advancement of one necessitates the reduction of the other .

		It seems probable , however , that
Bergson	PERSON	himself , in the course of his argument , does not ade - quately appreciate the refinements of the intui - tional side of our being , owing to the fact that the other aspect lends itself so much better to discussion .

		The treatment itself being intellec - tual , that faculty obscures the other , even dur - ing the process of attempting to show that it should not do so .

		Reality flows , and hence through intuition we come nearer to it than by our intellectual processes , which cut it up into blocks , and then attempt to piece it together again .

		Henceybe ^ - ing arises superior to thinking .

		This flow of being is real time or duration .

		The mechan - istic conception , that of modern physics and mathematics , destroys time by positing every - thing at once .

		Rigidly applied , it gives us a universe ready-made in every detail from the start .

		It matters not if that part of the arrange - ment which we place in the future is hidden from us , the picture is all there ready to be unrolled , and a sufficiently powerful intellect might perceive it all at once .

		Time thus becomes simply another dimension of an unchangeable and rigid universe .

		As Sir
George Darwin	PERSON	once suggested , it is simply a matter of the higher mathematics to foretell all of the future .

		Against all this ,
Bergson	PERSON	brings forward the luminous idea that life embodies in its present the whole of its past , or at least is conditioned by it , and flows on to a future which is unpredictable because essentially new .

		This idea can not be applied rigidly , for the reason that living beings themselves consist of '' matter , '' which behaves as non-living matter may .

		The point may be illustrated , however , by comparing , let us say , oneself with a piece of iron .

		The iron may yesterday have existed in iron sulphate , the day before in carbonate , and so on through all pos - sible combinations , but to-day it is simply iron , without anything to show that it was not always thus .

		It has thus no real history ; its past has no grip upon it .

		With myself I feel it to be quite otherwise .

		The sorrows and joys , suc - cesses and failures of my past life are stamped upon my being ; so also are the vicissitudes of my ancestors through millions of years of evolu - tion .

		The evol utionary process has not , it seems , merely been a shuffling of the cards it has been a continuous flow , possessing '' real dura - tion , '' conditioned by its past , yet new as well as old at every moment of its history .

		Life is thus to be compared , not with specific objects or substances in the inanimate world , but rather with the whole universe itself .

		Intuitively , we feel all this .

		Gaze upon a beautiful picture , fresh from the hand of the artist .

		Science tells us that there is nothing new .

		Every particle consists of substances which existed before the picture was dreamed of ; all that has happened is that they have been
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 newly arranged .

		Yet we know , beyond question , we see that which never existed before from the beginning of time ; we do not believe that the picture was postulated in the primeval mind , was part of a ready-made scheme of things , simply waiting to be brought to our attention .

		All this , indeed , without in the least denying the conclu - sions of the intellect , so far as they are entitled to go , but demanding to be freed from the rigid fatalism which must result from applying them to the realities of life itself .


Bergson	PERSON	, therefore , has grappled with the real problem of the universe , and has tried to give us a body of truth capable of serving the needs of all our faculties .

		In the very nature of the case , he could not wholly succeed , but those who know his work feel more and more that he has really let in a ray of light , in the beneficent beams of which many things are sure to grow and fructify .

		At the very least , he has stimu - lated much thought , and given pleasure to many .

		Although not immediately concerned with the practical outcome of it all in the work before us , he hints that the new attitude may well have its fruits in conduct .

		Thus : '' We see that the intellect , so skillful in dealing with the inert , is awkward the moment it touches the living .

		Whether it wants to treat the life of the body or the life of the mind , it proceeds with the rigor , the stiffness and the brutality of an instrument not designed for such use .

		The history of hygiene or of pedagogy teaches us much in this matter .

		When we think of the cardinal , urgent and constant need we have to preserve our bodies and to raise our souls , of the special facilities given to each of us , in this field , to experiment continually on our - selves and on others , of the palpable injury by which the wrongness of a medical or pedagogical practise is both made manifest and punished at once , we are amazed at the stupidity and especially at the persist - ence of errors .

		We may easily find their origin in the natural obstinacy with which we treat the living like the lifeless , and think all reality , however fluid , under the form of the sharply defined solid .

		We are at ease only in the discontinuous , in the immobile , in the dead .

		The intellect is characterised by a natural inability to com - prehend life '' -LRB- p. 165 -RRB- .

		And again : '' Human intelligence , as we represent it , is not at all what
Plato	PERSON	taught in the allegory of the cave .

		Its func - tion is not to look at passing shadows nor yet to turn itself round and contemplate the glaring sun .

		It has something else to do .

		Harnessed , like yoked oxen , to a heavy task , we feel the play of our muscles and joints , the weight of the plow and the resistance of the soil .

		To act and to know that we are acting , to come into touch with reality and even to live it , but only in the measure in which it concerns the work that is being accomplished and the furrow that is being plowed , such is the function of human intelligence '' -LRB- p. 191 -RRB- .

		In this brief summary we have noted imperfectly only some of the principal aspects of
Bergson	PERSON	's philosophy ; whole sections of it are left without consideration .

		In particular the very interest - ing discussion of the actual course of plant and animal evolution should be widely read , even by those who do not care for the strictly phil - osophical parts of the book .

		Many things , not actually in the work , are suggested by it ; thus a treatment of history from the Bergsonian point of view .

		In discussing scientific activity , I think it could be shown that whereas the operations and results of science are intellectual , the main -
spring	DATE	of scientific activity is instinctive or intu - itional .

		The scientific man lives more in reality than
Bergson	PERSON	perhaps allows , but his wares , when baked and ready for the market , are con - crete things .

		In closing , I will permit myself one more quotation . ''

		Life is tendency , and the essence of a tendency is to develop in the form of a sheaf , creating by its very growth divergent directions among which its impetus is divided .

		This we observe in ourselves , hi the evolution of that special tendency which we call our character .

		Each of us , glancing back over his history , will find that his child-personality , though indivisible , united in itself divers persons , which could remain blended just because they were in their nascent state : this indecision , so charged with promise , is one of the greatest charms of childhood .

		But these interwoven personalities become incompatible in course of growth , and , as each of us can live but one life , a choice must perforce be made .

		We choose in reality without ceasing ; without ceasing , also , we abandon many things .

		The route we pursue is in time strewn with the remains of all that we began to be , of all that we might have become .

		But nature , which has at command an incalculable number of lives , is in no wise bound to make such sacrifices .

		She preserves the different tendencies that have bifurcated with their growth .

		She creates with them diverging series of species that will evolve separately '' -LRB- p. 99 -RRB- .

		AN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PATRON OF SCIENCE .

		* The history of science in
England	LOCATION	furnishes a long list of men of large private fortunes who have devoted their lives to the advancement of knowledge .

		In no other country has the
Privat	ORGANIZATION	- gelehrte been so great a national asset .

		Sir
Joseph Banks	PERSON	occupies a prominent place in the ranks of these worthies .

		Born in
1743	DATE	, he early displayed a taste for natural science in all its fields .

		This first found expression in local collecting excursions , particularly botanical .

		Banks first came into real prominence in the * THE LIFE OF SIB
JOSEPH BANKS	PERSON	, President of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		With Notices of his Friends and Contem - poraries .

		By
Edward Smith	PERSON	,
F.R.H.S. New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, scientific world in
1768	DATE	, when he accompanied Captain -LRB- then Lieutenant -RRB- Cook on his first voyage .

		His connection with this voyage was characteristic of all his subsequent career .

		His position was that of the wealthy patron , keenly interested in scientific discovery , but with an interest tending rather toward that of the dilet - tante than of the professional .

		The lavish scale on which he felt it necessary to embark upon a scientific project is indicated in the following statement of his part in the Cook voyage : '' Banks 's preparations for his voyage were made on a most ample , not to say extravagant , scale .

		No expense was spared .

		The staff included
John Reynolds	PERSON	,
Sydney Parkinson	LOCATION	, and
Alexander Buchan	PERSON	, artists ;
Henry Spor	PERSON	- ing , assistant draughtsman ;
James Roberts	PERSON	and
Peter Briscoe	PERSON	, servants from Revesby ; and two negro servants .

		Besides these was
Daniel Carl Solander	PERSON	, whose acquaint - ance Banks had made in the preceding year .

		His status was perhaps that of friend and guest . ''

		This was certainly a formidable retinue .

		Upon his return from this voyage , Banks was much lionized , both in the scientific and social worlds .

		At this time began a friendship with
George III	PERSON	.

		which afterward became intimate , and which had the indirect effect of materially aiding the progress of science in
England	LOCATION	.

		On all matters in any way relating to science , the king sought and -LRB- usually -RRB- followed the advice of Banks .

		In
1778	DATE	came the crowning event of Sir
Joseph	PERSON	's career , his election to the presi - dency of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		This position he held for forty years , and then only relinquished it because of decidedly failing powers .

		In those days , to be President of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	was to be officially the leading man of science of the world .

		Everyone who had made , or supposed he had made , a discovery , or who had some scientific project to promote , com - municated his results or plans to the President of the '' Royal , '' who in turn laid the matter before the Fellows .

		Banks was one who evi - dently enjoyed most keenly the prestige and power associated with this position .

		That he administered the office in a manner and with a spirit at times decidedly dictatorial , is equally certain ; though his biographer is at great pains to excuse or defend this attitude .

		Evidence of the fact is clear both in Sir
Joseph	PERSON	's own corre - spondence , and in the accounts , brief though they are , of the intense if unsuccessful opposi - tion which developed against him within the society at various times in his career as Presi - dent .

		This '' high and mighty '' manner , taken with the fact that his part in science was that of the patron rather than of the productive investigator , subjected Banks to a deal of very keen and often bitter satire .

		To be sure , no person of prominence in the world of that day could expect to escape the attacks of the satirist and lampooner .

		But Banks received rather more of such attentions than could fairly be expected from a purely random distribution .

		A fair sample of these shafts of caricature is an epigram written by the Rev.
Thomas John Hussey	PERSON	on a pair of busts which adorned the walls of the
Royal Society Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		This ran as follows : I think I 've seen these things look very small : I 've seen a mouse in honest
Cluny	LOCATION	's stall , I 've seen a flea upon a lion 's hide , And Banks 's Bust with
Newton	ORGANIZATION	's side by side . ''

		The career of Banks illustrates in a striking and complete way that fame which rests on any - thing other than solid achievement is a very fleet - ing sort of thing .

		A hundred years ago he was certainly one of the leading figures in the scien - tific world , and very much in the public eye generally .

		A man of great public spirit , he was identified in one way or another with practically every noteworthy movement of his day , whether social , scientific , political , or what not .

		The organization of voyages of discovery , the found - ing of
Australia	LOCATION	, the inauguration of learned societies , the settlement of the international status of
Iceland	LOCATION	, with its resulting stimulation of the national life of that unfortunate country in all these things , and many more of nearly equal importance , Sir
Joseph Banks	PERSON	played some part , and in most instances a rather significant one .

		Yet to-day he is practically forgotten .

		It is doubtful if more than one professional scien - tist in ten of the present day -LRB- with the possible exception of the English -RRB- would be able to tell off-hand who Sir
Joseph Banks	PERSON	was .

		Yet every sophomore chemistry student knows something about a Dr.
Joseph Priestley	PERSON	who in his day was a very minor figure in comparison with Banks .

		A word must be said in praise of the way the story of an interesting life is told .

		From rather meagre documentary material , the author makes a decidedly entertaining book .

		It successfully meets the highest test of biographical writing , that of making the subject u live again '' as a real human being in the mind of the reader ; though the impression on the mind of the care - ful reader as to some points in Banks 's character will probably not be just that which the author intended to leave .

		But perfectly unbiassed biog - raphy would be rather dull reading in most instances .

		THE DIAL , 257 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Thackeray in N ?

		fc the least enjoyable souvenir of intimate letters this
Thackeray	PERSON	centennial year comes to hi kinsfolk .

		from the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	in the shape of a limited edition of '' Some Familiar Letters of
W. M. Thackeray	PERSON	, together with Recollections by his Kinswoman , Blanche Warre Cornish '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is printed on Alton hand - made paper in clear type of the
Baskerville	LOCATION	pattern , and neatly bound in hand-made paper boards , stamped with
Thackeray	PERSON	's monogram .

		An unfa - miliar but unmistakable portrait of the novelist by
Richard Doyle	PERSON	appears as frontispiece , being repro - duced from the original in the British Museum .

		The degree of Mrs.
Cornish	PERSON	's kinship to
Thackeray	PERSON	appears from her reference to '' my grandmother , Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	, who was the great novelist 's aunt . ''

		In other words ,
Blanche Ritchie	PERSON	was the daughter of
Thackeray	PERSON	's first cousin ,
William Ritchie	PERSON	, Advocate - General , with a large practice at the
Calcutta	LOCATION	bar .

		Her preliminary and interspersed comments and ex - planations add much to the interest of this hitherto unpublished collection of family letters from her illustrious kinsman .

		In her early recollection he was in personal appearance , '' very fresh , very wise - looking behind his spectacles , very attractive with his thick curling hair and rosy cheeks .

		There was an element of mystery about him fascinating even to childhood .

		He always seemed alone .

		He had just been in
America	LOCATION	.

		He was on his way to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		He was meteoric .

		He was exceedingly sad and silent .

		He was wondrously droll .

		Above all , he was kind . ''

		Not exactly sad is the vein in which he writes to that little girl 's father , in
1856	DATE	, from
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, where he is evidently giving readings : `` My orations is a great success here , and I am coining money at present at the rate of about half an Advocate-General , say 5 or 600 a month .

		I get 600 for my next book .

		Cock a doodle doo !

		The family is looking up , is n't it ? ''

		The book gives us near views of
Thackeray	PERSON	's home-life from his marriage to his death , and is redolent of the man and author at his best and brightest .

		The diversion , The genialty and originality of Mr. of a playful
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	have nowhere displayed essayist .

		themselves more agreeably than in his latest volume of essays , sketches , and whimsi - calities , entitled '' Old Lamps for New '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The note of cleverness is struck in the very first paper , which describes a supposed visit to a '' school for sympathy , '' where the pupils are taught kind - heartedness and mutual helpfulness by becoming themselves , each for a day at a time , the victims of sundry forms of disablement that can be harmlessly simulated for the occasion .

		The sad fate of the lame , the blind , the deaf , the dumb , and other un - fortunates , is thus brought vividly within the chil - dren 's comprehension .

		Other chapters have to do with pet dogs , art criticism and art history , divers sorts of real or imaginary incidents , passages of biography , and other miscellaneous matters capable of brief and witty or brief and wise treatment .

		Dialogue , too , of the bright sort familiar to readers of '' Mr.
Ingleside	PERSON	'' and '' Over Bemerton 's , '' en - livens an occasional chapter .

		Felicities of style and adroitness of phrase are not wanting .

		Single words also are used with an alert sense of their real meaning , as is exemplified in the opening paragraph of a delightful essay `` On Leaving One 's Beat , '' which begins : '' When I am going for a long rail - way journey I always buy a number of papers asso - ciated with walks of life as far as possible removed from my own .

		Then the time passes easily .

		The ordinary papers one reads too quickly ; the exor - bitant require attention they open the door to new worlds . ''

		A ' timely article entitled `` Thoughts on Tan '' tells how to gain the credit of having had a long vacation in the country -LRB- by the use of `` Sunbronze '' at so much the bottle -RRB- , and also how to acquire other forms of credit at a cheap rate .

		The book is well up to Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's high standard .


White House Colonel William Henry Crook	ORGANIZATION	, body - affairs under guard to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and subsequently ten presidents , disbursing officer at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, has probably seen more of the home-life of our presi - dents and their families than any other person now living .

		His `` Memories of the White House '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled from his diaries by Mr.
Henry Rood	PERSON	, and fully illustrated , is packed with entertaining incidents and anecdotes picturing the personal peculiarities and family life of the presi - dents from
Lincoln	LOCATION	to
Roosevelt	LOCATION	.

		It is the finer and nobler qualities of these men that impressed him , and his book , while throwing new light on many public characters , does so with due restraint .

		Its intimate glimpses of men who have made history are thoroughly enjoyable ; nor are the ladies and children of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	slighted .

		One is glad to note at the very outset that the writer quite clears himself from any share of blame for the admission of the assassin Booth to
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's box at
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre on the fatal night ; he was off duty on that occasion .

		In an earlier work -LRB- mention of which seems to be avoided in the present volume -RRB- , com - piled by another hand and entitled '' Through Five Administrations : Reminiscences of Colonel
William H. Crook	PERSON	, '' the same sources have been drawn upon as in the '' Memories , '' but only to the close of
Arthur	PERSON	's administration .

		Actual repetition has been skilfully avoided , but some slight discrepancies in statement of fact do occur in the two works , as , for instance , in the date of the writer 's entrance on his duties at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, the date of the first formal reception of that year , the breakfast hour of the Lincolns , and similar details that might , one would think , just as well have been made to agree in the two narratives , especially as it is impressed on the reader that the notes from which these details are drawn were taken down with care and fulness .

		Unnecessary misspellings of proper names occur now and then .

		Marshal Lamon of the earlier book THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, appears as '' Lammon '' in the later ; and one of President
Garfield	PERSON	's sons is incorrectly referred to as '' Irving ''
Garfield	PERSON	.

		It is for its later chapters that the book is especially welcome , as a supplement to its predecessor .

		Those who have read instal - ments of these reminiscences in various periodicals will be glad to see them collected and enlarged , in handsome and serviceable form .

		Recollection * Packed with memories of ante-bellum locietvtfhaif - days * n ^ ew
York	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, centurv ago .

		and elsewhere , and with a truly amazing variety of details as to the family history and genealogy , joys and sorrows , ups and downs , of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances , Mrs.
Samuel L. Gouverneur	PERSON	's autobiographical volume , `` As I Remember '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is a veritable treasure-house for those who delight to recall the
America	LOCATION	of sixty or seventy years ago , its social celebrities and society usages , its methods and man - ners , and the thousand and one episodes and inci - dents that make up the author 's '' Recollections of
American Society	ORGANIZATION	in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mrs.
Gouverneur	PERSON	congratulates herself on having been born in the one most desirable spot on the whole terrestrial globe near the village of
Jamaica	LOCATION	, on the south shore of
Long Island	LOCATION	, in an old-fashioned farm-house purchased from `` Citizen ''
Genet	PERSON	, the first Minister of
France	LOCATION	to this country , by
Captain John Hazard	ORGANIZATION	, Revolutionary hero and maternal grandfather of
Marian Campbell	PERSON	-LRB- the author of this book -RRB- , who was the daughter of Judge
James Campbell	PERSON	and afterward the wife of
Samuel L. Gouverneur , Jr.	PERSON	, a grandson , on his mother 's side , of President
Monroe	PERSON	.

		The capacity and tenacity of Mrs.
Gouverneur	PERSON	's memory are remarkable .

		Occa - sional errors of statement could hardly be avoided iu so extended a survey of the past , and some bias or prejudice here and there is almost necessary to give spice to the personal reminiscences ; but few will quarrel with the author on the score of inac - curacy or unfairness in her bright and sunny pages , the faithful mirror , we doubt not , of her own pleas - ing personality .

		An interesting portrait of her in her later years faces the title-page , and likenesses of friends and kindred illustrate the successive chapters .

		Slender in more than one sense is entitled ''
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's Symbolism : The Blue Bird and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The chapters on `` The Blue Bird '' have at least the merit of novelty ; the bird is , as most readers believe , a symbol of happiness , but it is pri - marily a symbol of '' celestial truth , '' a conclusion reached by the aid of
Swedenborg	PERSON	, for without a knowledge of the Science of Correspondences , the author asserts , parts of the play are meaningless . ''

		Celestial truth , '' the real theme of the play , is by consequence the central theme of these chapters ; on this peg Mr.
Rose	PERSON	ingeniously if not convincingly manages to hang all the ancillary symbols and ideas of the play .

		The '' Other Essays '' include , first , a study of the optimism of
Browning	PERSON	as manifested in ''
Pippa	PERSON	Passes '' an attack on the baneful '' laissez - faire views in religion '' that disciples of
Browning	PERSON	are addicted to , followed by an exposition of
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's actual meaning ; and , secondly , a chapter on `` The Musical Mind : A Study in Social Harmonies , '' in which the author asserts that
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Adelaide Proctor	PERSON	, and others , were imbued with '' the cooperative idea '' and re - form purposes ; in short , if we read aright , with an active humanitarianism .

		No part of the book im - presses one with Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's accuracy and profundity .

		The '' Blue Bird '' chapters are vitiated by a misquo - tation from
Wordsworth	PERSON	that is attributed to
Tenny	PERSON	- son ; the
Browning	PERSON	chapter sets forth , in lieu of wrong interpretations , others that are quite as dubi - ous ; and the closing chapter , on '' The Musical Mind , '' is scrappy , haphazard , and , in the last analysis , utterly pointless .

		It is obvious that the '' Other Essays '' were better omitted .

		The
Maeterlinck	PERSON	chap - ters , however , are at least worth attention .

		Correspondence The first volume f the '' LetterS f of a leader in
Richard Henry Lee	PERSON	, '' collected and the Revolution , edited by Dr.
James Curtis Ballagh	PERSON	, Associate Professor of
American History	ORGANIZATION	in the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, comes to us from the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	press .

		As
Lee	PERSON	served for a time as Presi - dent of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and was the mover of the various resolutions providing for the
Declara	LOCATION	- tion of Independence , for alliances with foreign powers , and for a plan of confederation for the Colonies , he exercised a powerful influence over the course of events during the Revolutionary period , and his letters are naturally of prime historical value .

		Dr.
Ballagh	PERSON	's statement that of about five hundred letters which he has collected more than half have never before been printed , demonstrates in itself the great importance of the publication .

		Of course , a great deal of it is unpleasant reading .

		No one who has ever penetrated a little way into the inside of our Revolutionary history has failed to discover that beneath the dominant current of patriotic heroism and self-sacrifice there was ever a muddy under-tow of selfishness , slander , jealousy , corruption , and inefficiency , dragging in the opposite direction ; and Lee had to tight with these untoward forces at home almost as continually as with the recognized enemy .

		About half the collection is embraced in the present volume , which begins with the
summer of 1762	DATE	and closes with the end of
1778	DATE	.

		It hardly needs to be said that the modern ideas of editorial faithfulness to the text and freedom from undue assumption are rigidly adhered to .

		Dr.
Ballagh	PERSON	does not assume to decide absolutely the meaning of '' supyly , '' but merely suggests in a footnote that it '' is probably a misprint for supply . ''

		The probability is distinctly heightened by the fact that the word '' supply '' is the only thing which will give sense in the context .

		and in their varied practical applications , so diffi - cult to present in popular form as that attempted by Dr.
T. S. Clouston	PERSON	in his treatise on '' Unsoundness of Mind '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The technical aspects of diag - nosis , classification , description , and treatment are couched in deterrent terms ; while the empirical nature of clinical insight leaves the lay mind adrift as to the sound basis or real import of the many varieties of unsound minds .

		So far as covering the ground in readable form , and offering a survey that must leave the attentive reader with a much more satisfactory impression and understanding of mental alienation than that he set out with , the book is a creditable and a useful contribution .

		There seem to be two dominant plans of popularization in regard to the mooted questions of sanity and insanity .

		The one proceeds upon the general equipment of techni - cal insight to present and enforce principles and their applications to the personal and social regulation of undesirable forms of mentality ; it aims to illu - minate , to enthuse , to interpret , to provide the spirit of application .

		The other accepts the clinical inter - est as dominant , and remains closely in the descrip - tive stage ; it recounts , explains , advises , relates , differentiates , informs .

		Dr.
Clouston	PERSON	's book is of the latter type .

		The works of
Maudsley	ORGANIZATION	, still most useful , accomplished the former task to a former gen - eration .

		Each type of work has its merits .

		There is at present a large opportunity for a renascence of the former interest , which , after all , is the intelligent general interest in the problems of unsoundness of mind .

		Sociology occupies a somewhat inde - Team-work in > j j , .

		,
Social Science	ORGANIZATION	, terminate territory bounded by the ever-shifting borders of its sister sci - ences , and doubts have been raised as to its precise rights and status .

		Professor
Albion Small	PERSON	, in '' The Meaning of Social Science '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , asserts his belief in the validity of sociology as a science ; but he has little faith in it as a field for specialization .

		All specialized science , he claims , '' inevitably passes into a stage of uncorrelated sci - entific piece-work . ''

		He makes , therefore , the fun - damental claim for sociology that , ideally , it unifies the data of history , economics , biology , and the other special sciences ; that its fundamental assertion must be to the effect that `` knowledge of human expe - rience can not at last be many ; in the degree in which it approaches reality , it must be one knowl - edge . ''

		In other words , the psychology of a given people at a given time is not one study , their eco - nomic history another study , and the theology of their clime and day a third and unrelated study , but each bears upon the other .

		. ''

		The part that one of these factors plays at a given moment is a function of the operation of all the other factors at the same time . ''

		To deal with human experience in this uni - versal way , '' team-work '' is necessary .

		Professor Small imagines a cooperative institute of scientists , each member of which would pursue the answer to some question of human experience through his own special science , but all the members would use in their problems the factors of each other 's results .

		Sociology , as the result of their labors , Dr. Small regards as a field for the humanist rather than for the scientific student ; as the only field , indeed , wherein human life may be studied rationally in all its phases and relations .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Under the general title of '' The Modern Travel Series , '' Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are issuing cheap editions of a number of standard books of travel and description .

		The first three titles in this series are as follows : '' Links in My Life on Land and Sea , '' by Commander
J. W. Gambier	PERSON	, R. N. ; '' In Dwarf Land and
Cannibal Country	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
A. B. Lloyd	PERSON	; and ''
Siberia	LOCATION	: A Record of Travel , Climbing , and Exploration , '' by Mr.
Samuel Turner	PERSON	.

		The volumes are fully illustrated , and sold at a low price .

		A fourth edition , practically rewritten , has been issued of Dr.
Jonathan Nield	PERSON	's `` Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Practically all historical novels in the English language , or which have been translated into English , are classified in this work according to the period with which they deal .

		The record of each book includes its publishers in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	and its subject , and books suit - able for young people are so marked .

		The volume is provided with an index of authors and titles .

		From the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	comes a volume on `` The Early Christians in
Rome	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.H.D.M .

		Spence-Jones ,
Dean of Gloucester and Professor of Ancient History	ORGANIZATION	in the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		One finds in it a large amount of important historical material , but rigid compression and careful arrangement might have given it all at much less cost of time to the busy reader .

		A too elaborate structure of Books , Parts , and Chapters gives rather a disintegrating effect to the eye , an impression only too closely in harmony with a lack of proper con - tinuity in the text itself .

		Unstinted commendation must be given , however , to the full and intelligently constructed index , a virtue which one does not often have the chance to praise .

		`` A Study in Southern Poetry '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , by the
North Carolina	LOCATION	lyrist ,
Henry Jerome Stockard	PERSON	, is not , as its title would indicate , a treatise on the poetry of the South , but primarily an anthology ; for the critical and interpretative material which it contains is both slight and of negligible value .

		Mr.
Stockard	PERSON	's gifts as editor are by no means comparable to his inspiration as poet .

		The volume is , nevertheless , superior in some respects to other similar collections of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	verse of which there are now a full half-dozen ; it is very well proportioned , and it exhibits an altogether admirable hoice of items .

		A special feature of the book is the arge number of contemporary poets represented , which nclude
A. C. Gordon	PERSON	, Will
Henry Thompson	PERSON	,
Samuel Minturn Peck	PERSON	,
William Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	,
Frank L. Stanton	PERSON	,
Benjamin Sledd	PERSON	,
Madison Cawein	PERSON	,
Walter Malone	PERSON	,
Virginia Frazer Boyle	PERSON	,
Olive Tilford Dargan	PERSON	, and the anthologist himself .

		Among noteworthy omis - sions are Mrs.
Danske Dandridge	PERSON	, Mr.
Cale Young Sice	PERSON	, and the earlier poets Meek and
Lamar	PERSON	.

		260 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Two books of unusual importance in the field of economics soon to be issued by the

		The House of Life '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a little book of lines written by Mr.

Peter	PERSON	and Wendy '' is the title of Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	's forthcoming story , which the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	will pub - lish in this country .

		Lovers of ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' scarcely need to be told that it has to do with the two principal characters of that perennial favorite .

		Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	has written a novel a sort of travesty or parody which he is calling ''
Zuleika Dob	PERSON	- son , '' and which is said to be as unlike the novels of contemporary novelists as his caricatures are unlike the drawings of other contemporary caricaturists .

		General Funston 's '' Memories of Two Wars '' and Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's '' Recollections , Grave and Gay , '' two autobiographies of widely different character , which have been appearing in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' during the past few months , are soon to be issued in book form by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		Mr.
H. Rider Haggard	PERSON	's '' dream story '' entitled '' The Mahatma and the Hare , '' soon to be issued by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will display this writer in a new vein .

		A strong humanitarian appeal is said to underlie this touching story of a hare and its life in a hunting preserve .

		Two books on
New York	LOCATION	's greatest thoroughfare are promised for
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	publication .

		One is Mr.
J. B. Kerfoot	PERSON	's '' Broadway , '' for which Mr.

Stephen Jenkins	PERSON	, and bears the title , `` The Greatest Street in the World . ''

		`` The Collected Papers of
Frederick William Mait	PERSON	- land , '' edited by Mr.
H. A. L. Fisher	PERSON	, will be published in three volumes by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, acting as agents for the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chief value of the collection will , of course , be found in the papers dealing with legal history .

		Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	, the
New York	LOCATION	dramatic critic , has for many years been engaged in collecting material regarding American dramatists and their work .

		He has now prepared for
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	publication a book entitled '' The American Dramatist , '' which Messrs. Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish . ''

		The American Jewish Year Book '' for
5672	DATE	, pub - lished by the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, is edited , as before , by Mr.
Herbert Friedenwald	PERSON	.

		Its prin - cipal feature this year is a discussion of the Passport Question in its latest phases .

		Most of the lists given in former volumes are here continued .

Whistler	LOCATION	will be glad to know that a new edition , in a single volume , of Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's life of the artist , published three years ago , is soon to be published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A large amount of new material will be embodied in the new edition , and it is to be fully illustrated . ''

		The Leaves of the Tree '' is the title of the new volume by Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	, which the Putnams will publish this month .

		In it Mr.
Benson	PERSON	presents biographical sketches and appreciations of certain distinguished men , each one of whom , through his life , his character , his works , and above all through personal contact , has exercised a constructive influence upon the author of '' The Upton Letters '' and '' The Silent Isle . ''

		One of the few remaining private presses is the Cuala Press of
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, where Miss
Elizabeth Yeats	PERSON	prints limited editions of books by her brother ,
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and other Irish writers .

		Mr.
Mitchell Ken	PERSON	- nerley has arranged to import a few copies of each new Cuala Press book as it appears , and has now ready ''
J. M. Synge	PERSON	and the
Ireland	LOCATION	of his Time '' by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	.

		A new volume of poems by the same author will also be issued shortly .

		The new and revised edition of '' The
Century Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary , Cyclopedia and Atlas , '' which the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		will issue this
Autumn	DATE	, will appear in twelve volumes , instead of ten as before .

		The paper used for the work is the result of much experimenting .


India	LOCATION	paper for a dictionary , the leaves of which must be turned over very rapidly , seemed out of the question , but there has been produced for this edition a thin , opaque paper which prints cuts well and is strong and durable .

		Early in

Arthur Ponsonby	PERSON	,

		There is a well-worn story of a genial gentle - man who , when mention was made of a lecture on
Keats	PERSON	, innocently asked , '' What are Keats ? ''

		It will do well enough to assume that it was the same person who supposed
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	to be a kind of cheese , and who unbared his perplexed soul when he asked a kind friend to explain to him the exact distinction between
Hunyadi Janos	PERSON	and
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	.

		It may not even be going too far to attribute to the same inquir - ing spirit the remark , apropos of a reference to Homer 's Odyssey , '' Homer 's , I believe , is the best . ''

		The condition of mind which these an - cient jests serve to illustrate is by no means uncommon , and there is some reason to think that it is being created in more numerous ex - amples than ever before by the educational methods currently in vogue , and by feeding upon the intellectual pabulum provided by the newspapers and other forms of cheap popular literature for most of our present-day readers .

		What to do about it becomes a more and more serious question to those who are not willing to accept such a counsel of despair as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Es muss doch solche K'duze geben '' and turn an indifferent gaze to the manifestations of mental ineptitude that confront us upon every hand every day of the year .

		Of one thing there can be no doubt : the complacency of the type of mind which the '' howlers '' above cited exemplify is as complete as its ignorance is comprehensive .

		A smug self - satisfaction coupled with a condescending willingness to be informed rather than with an eagerness to learn , is the attitude such exhibits betray .

		Mr.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	, commenting upon various instances of naive self - revelation , brings the matter home to us .

		He professes to be unable to distin - guish between the examples that are afforded by actual experience and those that are merely humorous inventions .

		The difficulty arises , he says , `` from careless reading in newspapers , novels , and books of sarcasm about
America	LOCATION	, without trying to remember which is which .

		It is , of course , altogether irrational .

		I know , for example , that
Colonel Watterson	PERSON	did not occur in '
Martin Chuzzlewit	PERSON	, ' but is occurring daily in some
Southern State	ORGANIZATION	.

		I know that 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Senator
Beveridge	PERSON	is not an invention of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, but , on the contrary , a physio - logical fact , one of nature 's cunning plagiaries . ''

		To account for one of these authentic instances , it would be necessary to make an exhaustive study of the man 's upbringing and enviroment , and perhaps to supplement the study by an ex - amination of his ancestral strain .

		The psycho - logical make-up in which obtuseness and stolidity are commingled with rudimentary imaginative power and a well-nigh total lack of the sense of humor will exhibit surprising reactions ; but , whatever form they may assume , they will all illustrate La Bruydre 's maxim : `` Tout I ` esprit qui est au monde est inutile a celui qui rfen a point . '

		And they will all suggest the lamentable case of
Peter Bell	PERSON	, who could see in the prim - rose nothing but a yellow flower certainly no Rhodora or Genestra , no mountain daisy or lesser celandine . ''

		To a German we might have compressed all this long description into a single word , '' says
Carlyle	PERSON	, writing of
William Taylor	PERSON	's '' Historic Survey of German Poetry . '' ''

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	is what they call a
Philister	LOCATION	; every fibre of him is Philistine .

		With us , such men usually take into politics and become Code - makers and Utilitarians . ''

		Since
Carlyle	PERSON	wrote these words we have naturalized the term thanks mainly to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and have found it useful to have the concept thus ver - bally crystallized .

		The persons whom the Ger - mans call
Philistines	LOCATION	and the French epiciers are oppressively numerous in our own conntry .

		Despite the good things that may fairly be said about them , and regardless of
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's malicious suggestion that the name is '' applied by prigs to the rest of their species , '' our Philistines make a most distressful braying in the market-place , and the plea of the spirit is not easily to be heard amidst the din .

		They muddle everything they touch politics , edu - cation , art , ethics , religion , reducing to hard material terms the most elusive problems of life .

		Themselves inacessible to ideas , they create an atmosphere which stifles all the finer instincts and aspirations , and makes the idealist feel `` that the sky over his head is of brass and iron . ''

		They even construct counterfeit ideal - isms of their own in politics , socialism ; in education , vocational training ; in art , realism ; in ethics , hedonism ; in religion , ceremonial and dogma , all of the earth , earthy , and all pitifully inadequate to feed the soul intent upon free individual growth , eager to invest itself with beauty , athirst for truth and righteous - ness , holding blessedness to be a higher aim than happiness in its determination of the con - duct of life .

		Thus , by a somewhat devious path , we come to what is after all a very simple proposition that the equipment of the mind is the only thing that really matters in a man 's relations to this complicated and many-colored world . ''

		The mere lapse of years is not life , '' says
Martineau	PERSON	. ''

		To eat , to drink , and to sleep , to be exposed to darkness and the light , to pace round in the mill of habit , and turn thought into an imple - ment of trade , this is not life ; knowledge , truth , love , beauty , goodness , faith , alone can give vitality to the mechanism of existence . ''

		But all these elements of life in the richer sense are the reactions of the thinking subject to the impressions made by the external world .

		The mind is no passive recipient , but a source of creative energy ; and its own contribution is what gives value and significance to every such reaction .

		It is one of the oldest of common - places to say that what a man brings to the contemplation of nature and art is the measure of what he gains .

		The young Parsifal , stolid and unresponsive , beholds unmoved the suffer - ings of the King and the unveiling of the sacred vessel .

		The older Parsifal , enriched by experi - ence and enlightened by divine sympathy , redeems the brotherhood from its curse , and is fit to assume the functions of priest and king .

		In this allegory we touch the heart of life , and drink refreshment from its deepest and most hidden springs .

		Fundamental in importance among the influ - ences which have caused the tribe of
Peter	PERSON	to multiply in such numbers among us , and have made the myopic Petrine vision almost the normal type of our modern seeing , is the wanton and lamentable neglect of the great literary sources of imaginative power and ethical inspira - tion .

		We batten upon moors when we might feed upon the fairest of mountain pastures .

		We no longer lift up our eyes unto the distant hills whence cometh strength , but fix them upon the lowlands close at hand , fat with their material harvests .

		We do not purge the visual nerve with the euphrasy of noble poetry , but narcotize its sensitive fibres with amorphous prose .

		When we might be adding to our spiritual stature by communion with the great souls who beckon to us from the pages of literature , we accept instead the stunted development that comes from fixing our attention upon the miserable writings of the day , deriving from them the dull satisfac - tion that means no more than exemption from
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 the need of mental effort and from the annoy - ance of growing pains .

		Most fatal of all the shortcomings of the type of mind which so distressingly asserts itself in this new century is its ignorance of the
Bible	LOCATION	and of the ancient classics .

		From every school and college in the country the cry goes out that young people show no signs of familiarity with these foundations of cultural education , and that in consequence a large part of modern literature is to them a sealed book .

		What are euphemistically called educational advantages do not nowadays seem to include the advantage of the preparation without which no student is fit to enter into his rightful inheritance of English letters .

		Where shall we fix the responsibility for the purblind outlook of so many who pass for educated men ?

		It would be unjust to charge it all to the account of the colleges .

		They do about the best they can with the plastic material placed in their hands for moulding , and should rest under no severer indictment than that of fostering a confused sense of values , and con - ducting an educational process in which there are far too many loose ends .

		The lower schools come in for some share of the censure , and the parents for some further share .

		But the evil must in large measure be ascribed to the gen - eral conditions of American life , to the ideals which are in the air , to the prevailing incentive of commercialism , and to the countless influences that encourage the frivolous dispositions of the young , and discourage the development of their serious aptitudes .

		Against the pressure of the spiritually enervating environment to which our youth is almost everywhere exposed , it is little more than a futile resistance that may be offered by school and college .

		That a
spring	DATE	can rise no higher than its source , is unquestionable as a proposition of hydrodynamics ; but if we were to accept it as a principle of education , we should indeed be yielding to a counsel of de.-spair .

		Is the new generation to do no better than the old , and is its growth to be cribbed , cabined , and confined by the conditions that have stunted its predeces - sor ?

		If the lesson of failure were to be read as meaning the inevitability of new failure , there would be small hope for the future of mankind .

		But as the individual may rise on stepping - stones of its dead self to higher things , so the new generation may profit by the mistakes of the old , and attain to a clearer vision .

		Dul - ness of mind in the adult may be the expres - sion of native defect , but it is more likely to be the consequence of neglecting opportunities that were offered by the impressionable years of childhood .

		How easily a child 's feet may be led into the pleasant paths of literature , and his eager mind stored with images and emotions that will remain fresh for the rest of his life !

		And with what perverse exercise of pedantic ingenuity do we create in him a sullen hatred for literature , sealing forever its copious springs of joy !

		Says the author of '' Sartor Resartus '' : '' How can an inanimate mechanical gerund-grinder , the like of whom will , in a subsequent country , be manufactured at
Niirnberg	ORGANIZATION	out of wood and leather , foster the growth of anything , much more of Mind , which grows not like a vegetable -LRB- by having its roots littered with etymological compost -RRB- , but like a spirit by mysterious contact of spirit ; thought kindling itself at the fire of living thought ?

		How shall he give kind - ling in whose inward man there is no live coal , but all is burnt out to a dead grammatical cinder ? ''

		In the deepest sense , '' this very real world of ours , with all its suns and milky ways , '' exists only in the subject mind which beholds it , for such is the ultimate teaching of philosophy .

		It is a world created under the forms of time and space and causation , and emerges from the void into seeming reality only when the subject mind imposes these forms upon whatever may be its objective counterpart .

		But without dwelling upon this metaphysical abstraction , it may be said that superimposed upon this formal structure this causally ordered world of exten - sion and sequence there is for each individual the world of his own special making .

		Whatever richness of content this world of the individual may have , whatever wealth of intellectual and emotional meaning it may possess for him , is the function of his own mental equipment .

		It is the subjective factor in this dual relation out of which his world is shaped that determines how much of a world it shall be .

		It is a world simple or complex , dull or glowing , meaningless or purposeful , in accordance with what he con - tributes to its fashioning .


Peter	PERSON	's world and the world of Plato and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	have the same foundations , but how immense their difference in superstructure !

		They offer the contrast between dull monotony of surface and richly-figured design , between flat low-lying roofs and soaring spires .

		And if such a thing as freedom of choice there be , the individual must find its noblest exercise in seeking to make spacious his spiritual habitation , harmonious in its proportioning , lovely in its adornment , and far-seeing in its outlook .

		This is the funda - mental obligation of all self-discipline , and should be the controlling purpose of every educational system .

		284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, TWO KINDS OF HEADERS .

		The stream of the season 's new books is now almost at flood , a swollen torrent fed by innumer - able tributaries ; and again the recurrent question arises , How does so much reading-matter ever con - trive to get itself read ?

		The readers of all these new books , like readers in general , may be roughly divided into two obvious classes readers for pleasure and readers for profit , or light-minded readers and serious-minded readers ; with all degrees of inter-shading and inter-mingling , as in nearly every scheme of classification in nature .

		Not novels alone attract the pleasure-seeking reader , nor does the purposeful student invariably scorn the delights of fiction and live his laborious days in a rarefied atmosphere of pure science .

		A serious - minded person 's plan of self-culture may include a daily stint of current fiction , just as a thoughtless and fun-loving person 's appetite may spontaneously crave an occasional dose of history or biography , of travels or essays , or even of philosophy or religion .

		What distinguishes the one class from the other is not so much the choice of books as the consciousness of such choice .

		Those who live to read , who make a serious business of reading and every little while dig up the soil of their minds to see whether the literary seed there sown has begun to sprout , stand in a class apart from those who read to live more abundantly and zestfully , and who , it may be , can not to-day recall title or author of the book they laughed and cried over yesterday .

		Every reader knows , or thinks he knows , to which of these two classes he belongs , and feels a certain superiority , acknowl - edged or unacknowledged , over those of the other class .

		Nevertheless there are undoubtedly some who , admitting themselves to be frivolous readers , wish that they had the strength of mind to become serious readers ; and others there are who , sadly confessing that their days of careless , irresponsible , ecstatic reading are over , unavailingly long to recap - ture the charm that poetry and romance and history and adventure once had for them .

		Spontaneous readers -LRB- if one may so name those who read to live , as opposed to self-conscious read - ers , or those who live to read -RRB- never read by the clock , never assign themselves so many pages or chapters a day , never have to use a bookmark or , when this gets misplaced , feel compelled to go back again and read from the beginning , as did the plodding pedant who got as far as Z in the encyclo - paedia and then had to turn back to A because he had lost his place .

		But the systematic reader never gets caught in this fashion .

		The perpetual con - sciousness of a purpose in all one 's reading precludes the possibility of rapture .

		Time and space and all things terrestrial do not easily cease to exist for him who reads -LRB- as we have done , to our sorrow , long ago , in the foolishness of youth -RRB- all of Homer in daily portions of so many lines , and the entire Bible in course , a chapter a day .

		Subsequent hap - hazard readings in both Homer and the
Bible	LOCATION	have , with us , proved far more productive of oblivion to the carking cares of life .

		Perhaps those self-imposed daily readings were not , after all , quite void of benefit to the reader ; youth , with mind comparatively un - furnished and elective affinities undeveloped , might in many instances be slow to get beyond its first story-books without the spur of a conscious purpose .

		To read a book in order to be able truthfully to say that one has read it , or to read copiously in order to astonish and awe others with a catalogue of one 's achievements of this sort , is a very familiar form of serious reading .

		Most persons are at some time in their lives guilty of this weakness , and not a few never wholly cure themselves of it .

		There comes to mind a lady of our acquaintance who , with an abounding zeal for self-culture , passed a studi - ous semester at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, where she wearied her friends with constant enumeration of the books and authors she had mastered , or thought she had mas - tered .

		Ich habe gelesen this and that and the other , became the burden of her conversation , until she acquired for herself the nickname of Ich habe gelesen .

		And what did it all amount to , except that she turned into a sort of walking catalogue of the German classics ?

		The libraries of such persons as this estimable but unstimulating lady are likely to reflect their attitude toward books .

		Posing as persons of cul - ture , they fill their shelves with all the books no gentleman 's library should be without , and have little intimate acquaintance with or fondness for what the books contain .

		A friend of ours whose vocation leaves him little time for reading was recently displaying his fine sets of English authors , purchased one after another in richly bound edi - tions , when we chanced to inquire whether he en - joyed
Smollett	PERSON	, whose complete works in sumptuous dress presented an imposing platoon on their shelf .

		The reply , prompt and unconcerned , indicated that he had no acquaintance whatever with the volumi - nous
Tobias	PERSON	, and apparently had no intention of cultivating one .

		How different from this was book-loving
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's way of acquiring a library !

		Every volume had its birth in his mind and desire before it took material form on his shelves .

		An old author , hun - grily devoured with his eyes in the window of some second-hand bookshop , or perhaps all but read through in snatches as he daily passed a favorite bookstall , would become , in process of time and when the purchase money could be spared , the prized possession of the
East India House	ORGANIZATION	clerk , who , with his sister perhaps to share his joy and pride , would triumphantly bear the coveted treasure home and there revel at leisure in its delights .

		In somewhat the same gradual and characteristic fashion did
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	get together the modest collection of books whose disorderly array and hard usage testified to his visitors how much more he cared about reading his favorites than about displaying them as a part of the furniture of his house .

		The ruthless plucking-out of such portions
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 of his books as displeased him added no little to their disreputable appearance ; but what cared he for that ?

		Even
Southey	PERSON	, literary hack though he was forced to become , had probably read and en - joyed every volume in his book-packed hermitage at
Keswick	PERSON	.

		Though his copious reading must have usually had an end in view , he would doubtless have read about as much for the mere love of reading had he been able to afford himself that luxury .

		Unhappy is the lot of those whose literary inclina - tions tend in one direction , and whose real or sup - posed duty points them to other fields of study or reading .

		The bishop whose surreptitiously enjoyed novel must be hurriedly thrust into a drawer when a knock sounds on his study door , and his counte - nance composed to the seriousness of the early
Chris	PERSON	- tian father open on the desk before him , is living a divided life and in peril of most unepiscopal discom - fiture .

		Better for him to thrust his early Christian father into the drawer , if his theological studies are a mere pretense , and fearlessly and openly to con - tinue the reading of his fascinating novel , exclaiming with
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in `` The Library , '' was it not ? -RRB- ''

		Go on !

		and while the sons of care complain , Be wisely gay and innocently vain ; While serious souls are by their fears undone , Blow sportive bladders in the beamy sun . ''

		The reader , like everyone else who desires peace of mind , must follow
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's advice and resolve to be himself , knowing that '' he who finds himself loses his misery . ''

		It has been said that some read to think , some read to write , and some read to talk ; but whatsoever the purpose the building up of mental tissue , the making of other books , or the exhibition of intellec - tual brilliance it may often occur that he who comes to his reading with a purpose remains to read for pleasure , while he who reads at first merely to pass the time may find himself suddenly seized with an interest in some field of study casually suggested by the book of entertainment before him .

		Not seldom , too , does he who reads with no professed object but the enjoyment of reading acquire in the end more real culture , more uplifting of the spirit and refining of the taste , than he who starts out with this praiseworthy end in view .

		Thus , between the purposeful and the purposeless , the readers for pleasure and the readers for profit , the serious and systematic students and the care - lessly joyous book-tasters , it ultimately comes about in this best of all possible worlds -LRB- or best , of all actual worlds that we are acquainted with -RRB- that the enormous yearly product of our printing-presses contrives , for the most part , to get itself read , some - how and somewhere .

		Or even if a part of it gets no further than the library bookshelves , and not into any actual reader 's hands , that is still something , since the always possible future reader may at any moment become actual , and it is for the possible as well as for the actual reader that librarians feel themselves bound to provide .

		There is more joy in a library over one applicant for
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson	PERSON	's '' Curiosa Mathematica '' than over ninety and nine clamorers for
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	's '' Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	. ''

		THE LOSS OF A GREAT TEACHER .

		Dr.
John Bascom	PERSON	, full of years and honors , beloved in the college he had so long and faithfully served , and in the town whose welfare he had for decades helped to promote , admired for his breadth and depth of learning and for the range of his liter - ary activities , and especially esteemed by DIAL readers for his scholarly contributions extending over a quarter of a century , died on the second of this month , at his home in
Williamstown	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, at the age of eighty-four .

		With the exception of his fourteen years ' presidency of the
Wisconsin State University	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Bascom	PERSON	's services as educator were given to the
New England	LOCATION	college where he received his own education .

		Some incipient training for the bar and afterward for the pulpit followed his gradu - ation from
Williams	ORGANIZATION	in
1849	DATE	; but from
1855	DATE	to
1902	DATE	-LRB- excepting the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	presidency -RRB- he taught at
Williams	ORGANIZATION	rhetoric , sociology , political economy , and , most important of all , character and manhood and civic virtue .

		Two qualities especially impressed those whose good fortune it was to know Dr.
Bascom	PERSON	: his indomitable courage in matters of principle and personal conviction , and the courtly formality the gentleman-of-the-old-school manner that marked his bearing .

		His books , too numerous to admit of a full list of their titles here , were the ripened fruit of his years of teaching , and dealt chiefly with phil - osophical , ethical , economic , and religious subjects .

		A characteristic minor activity of this variously gifted man was his effective work as chairman of the
Greylock State Reservation	ORGANIZATION	commission .

		Pro- fessor emeritus since
1902	DATE	, he had leisure and strength to continue almost to the end his services to literature and to his community .

		Both the smaller world that knew him intimately and the larger one that knew him only by his writings will feel his loss .

		To THE DIAL the loss is very great .

		He was a ready and forcible writer , and his wide range of knowledge , his broad outlook , his sweet and charitable temper , his high ideals and his moral integrity , together with his soundness of judgment and clearness of mental vision , gave his contributions a quality that made them always welcome and which will now be sadly missed .

		His last published article '' The Case of
Mary Wollstonecraf	PERSON	t '' appeared in THE DIAL of
August 1	DATE	; and at the time of his death he was engaged in preparing for its columns a review of
Taussig	PERSON	's '' Principles of Economics , '' a work that powerfully appealed to him , and aroused an interest indicative of a vigor of mind and a hold upon vital principles and problems rarely possessed at an age when most men have left them far behind , if indeed they ever cared for them in the sense in which this fine patriot and scholar made them the chief concern of his long and unselfish life .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
CAS	ORGANIZATION	UA L COMMENT .

		THE PERILS AND PROBLEMS OF THE PUBLISHING BUSINESS are seldom thought of by the average reader .

		Indeed , he does not even suspect their existence , but assumes that the manufacture of books is much like the manufacture of a thousand other sorts of goods , only getting his impressions from the fabulous or fabricated reports of '' best sellers '' a great deal more profitable .

		The truth of the matter , however , is something very different . ''

		The Worst Business in the World '' is what one publisher , Mr.
R. S. Yard	PERSON	, calls it , in a recent article .

		But this worst business plainly appears in the end to be , to the born publisher , the best business in the world .

		Its compensations , however , are not always to be expressed in pecuniary terms ; indeed , it may be said that no one , with such standards alone , can ever win name and fame as a publisher .

		It is encouraging to note that Mr.
Yard	PERSON	finds that pres - ent tendencies in the publishing business are in the direction of sounder and more conservative methods .

		The craze of indiscriminate advertising of ten years ago when '' best-sellers , '' regardless of quality , were the rage in the publishing world , and it was fondly imagined that books needed only to be advertised like soap or breakfast food to be - come fortune-winners for all concerned is for - tunately giving place to saner views ; and a more discreet exploitation of his wares by judicious and unsensational methods has become the rule with the discerning and successful publisher .

		It is not the precarious popular novels that support the publish - ing houses , but rather the less spectacular and more permanent book whose sales will continue long after the sky-rocketing sensation of the day has been for - gotten .

		There is excitement enough and fascination enough in conducting a publishing business by sane and conservative methods without courting disaster in trying to achieve the impossible by reckless man - agement and crazy forms of exploitation .

		DR.
JOHNSON	PERSON	ON GOLF , or what he might have said on that favorite pastime of the despised
Scot	PERSON	, may be read in an alleged Boswellian fragment accidentally omitted from the '' Tour to the
Hebri	PERSON	- des . ''

		The perpetrator of the amusing hoax we suspect to be the fabricator of that still more amus - ing forgery , `` The Old Librarian 's Almanac . ''

		Johnson 's elephantine manner is well imitated , but the clever writer out-Johnsons
Johnson	PERSON	to such a degree as to betray the deception as may be illus - trated by a few extracts . ''

		Sir , '' exclaims the tourist to the Hebrides to his companion , '' it is a lament - able reflection that any sentient being , presumably possessing a soul and having some rudiments of intelligence , should discover a fascination in pro- pelling a spherical bundle of feathers with a bent stick into a succession of terranean orifices ... For assuming that any object whatever is to be gained by depositing the ball successively in a number of such orifices , that object would be most rapidly and effectively achieved by carrying it in the hand from orifice to orifice , rather than by propelling it labori - ously .

		and often , I understand , erratically with an egregious instrument ridiculously ill-suited to the purpose . ''

		On being assured by
Boswell	PERSON	that `` it is the difficulty of the method that constitutes its charm , ''
Johnson	PERSON	replies : '' Sir , if I should choose to shave myself with an oyster-shell instead of a razor , there would be no harm in it ; but it would be none the less the height of imbecility . ''

		This ingeniously-conceived dialogue is followed by the laughable but incredible conversion of the doughty objector through actual experience of the game , whose charm even he fails to withstand .

		INDEX-MAKING AS A FIELD FOR PRISON LABOR is a somewhat startling suggestion , especially when appearing in a publication for and by librarians .

		In the substantial and well-prepared Report of the Pro- ceedings of the
Conference of American Librarians	ORGANIZATION	, held
last May	DATE	at
Pasadena	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, we find the surpris - ing statement -LRB- page 234 -RRB- that '' Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	is quoted as saying that ' indexing is a task that is only fit for prison convicts . ' ''

		If Dr.
Poole	PERSON	has ever been quoted as authority for such a say ing , let him be quoted no more .

		Of all men in
America	LOCATION	, he was precisely the least likely to utter such a sentiment .

		A man who spent many years in the honorable and difficult work of indexing , and whose great Index to Periodi - cal Literature perpetuates his name and remains the chief monument of his active and useful life , would hardly speak of the task of index-making in terms of contemptuous disparagement .

		The queer saying for which he is made responsible is easily traceable to something he once wrote for THE DIAL , in which , in his playfully sarcastic way , he spoke of the belief of the uninitiated that '' anyone can do indexing , '' the qualifications therefor being supposed to be about one degree above those of a day laborer , and suggested that such work might , in the interest of economy , be farmed out among contractors for prison labor .

		No one knew better than Dr.
Poole	PERSON	that good indexing requires rare qualities of scholar - ship , intelligence , and aptitude ; and that a really good index is as rare as it is refreshing to those who know the difference between good and bad .

		LINCOLNIANA CURIOSA , to the number of twelve hundred and thirty-seven items , engaged the atten - tion of bidders at the auction rooms of
Messrs. C. F. Libbie & Co.	ORGANIZATION	at the end of
last month	DATE	.

		A few titles and prices will indicate the undiminished interest of collectors in every literary memento of our second-greatest national hero .

		The rare but not yet very old first edition of ''
Herudon	PERSON	's Lincoln : The True Story of a Great Life '' -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	,
1889	DATE	-RRB- brought
forty-six dollars	MONEY	and
fifty cents	MONEY	.

		A curious anonymous publication entitled '' Lincoln 's
Assassi	PERSON	- nation Traced Directly to the Doors of
Rome	LOCATION	'' went at
twenty-six dollars	MONEY	.

		Two lines of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's writ - ing in response to a request for his autograph were considered worth fifteen dollars by the successful

		THE DIAL 287 bidder .

		Even so late and so slight a work as Mr.
Frederick H. Meserve	PERSON	's privately printed account of '' The Photographs of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' issued early this year at
thirty-five dollars	MONEY	, commanded fifty upon this its first appearance in the auction mart ; and the Lincoln Day proclamation of Gov - ernor
Draper	PERSON	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	-LRB-
1905	DATE	-RRB- , in printer 's proof , sent emulous bidders up to fourteen dollars , the price paid for the far more valuable manuscript of
R. H. Stoddard	PERSON	's poem on
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		For a facsimile of certain papers from
Lincoln	LOCATION	's pen , written when he was attorney for the
Illinois Cen	ORGANIZATION	- tral Railroad , ten dollars and a half was paid .

		Evidently Lincoln relics are not yet likely to become a drug in the market .

		THE CLEAN PRINTING OF CLEAN LITERATURE , rather than the untidy or disease-spreading manufac - ture of literature of any kind , can not but be regarded as a desideratum by every intelligent reader .

		The
International Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	, an organization of about sixty thousand members of the printing craft , is making a determined effort to secure hygi - enic conditions in every printing house where its members are found .

		Against tuberculosis especially are its beneficent energies directed , as is already known to many from the excellent work carried on by the
Union	ORGANIZATION	at the Printers ' Home which it has established at
Colorado Springs	LOCATION	.

		This institution , dedicated in
1892	DATE	, now occupies buildings and grounds valued at
one million dollars	MONEY	, and about the same amount has been spent in its maintenance .

		An illustrated booklet issued by the
Union	ORGANIZATION	describes the Home and its work in such terms as almost to make one wish one were a veteran compositor and thus eligible to admission to the beautiful asylum .

		No enterprise of any other trade-union with which we are acquainted compares with this anti-tuberculosis crusade in magnitude and beneficence .

		The official publication of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, * ' The Typographical Jour - nal , '' which reaches every one of its members , gives valuable aid to the movement ; and requests for infor - mation , addressed to the
Indianapolis	LOCATION	headquarters of the organization , will receive courteous attention .

		THE PUZZLING PARTICIPLE FORM OF THE EN - GLISH VERB the form ending in - ing and serving sometimes as a present participle , sometimes as an adjective , sometimes as a gerund or '' infinitive in - ing '' as it is also called , and sometimes as a prepo - sition receives full treatment in the
October	DATE	'' Bulletin of the
University of South Carolina	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Professor
Reed Smith	PERSON	, of the English department of that university , is the author of the treatise , which he entitles `` Participle and Infinitive in - ing . ''

		The etymology of this interesting and variously serviceable suffix is briefly traced from the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	endings - ung , - ende , and - anne or - enne , down through their successive modifications and final unanimous adoption of the form familiar to us .

		The variety of uses served by the ending will not have occurred to most persons before being confronted with such a list of examples as Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has drawn up , a few of which may here be profitably cited . ''

		Running to the door , he opened it quickly . ''

		`` Running water is pure . '' ''

		Running a horse up - hill is cruel . '' ''

		The rapid running of the train made him dizzy . ''

		`` I go a - fishing . ''

		`` Pending your arrival , decision has been delayed . '' ''

		The land of the living . '' ''

		There 's nothing doing . '' ''

		The house is building . '' ''

		The bread is being baked . '' ''

		Forty and six years was this temple in building . '' ''

		Owing to his sickness , the visit was postponed . ''

		The two general classes into which - ing forms may be divided are those of verb-adjec - tives and verb-nouns , or participles and infinitives -LRB- or gerunds -RRB- .

		It is to be noted with approval that the author withholds his sanction from the use , more common in
England	LOCATION	than in this country , of such constructions as `` me seeing '' for `` my seeing , '' and `` John shouting '' for `` John 's shouting . ''

		The pamphlet runs to forty-three pages , all packed with examples and remarks of interest both to the pro- fessional grammarian and to the average person who wishes to handle with dexterity and precision this marvellous tool of human speech .

		THE DEATH OF THE ORIGINAL OF ``
SHERLOCK HOLMES	PERSON	, '' on the fourth of
October	DATE	, at his home near
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, reminds the readers of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	that it is not far from a score of years since Dr.
Joseph Bell	PERSON	, an instructor of the novelist in his formative period , unwittingly gave him the germinal idea whence grew the famous detective stories which made the young writer 's reputation .

		Dr.
Bell	PERSON	was born in
1837	DATE	, and early showed such skill in the application of inductive methods to the practice of his profession that , long before the crea - tion of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, he was chosen as assistant to Dr.
Littlewood	PERSON	, official adviser to the British crown in cases of medical jurisprudence .

		It was his application of the same methods in a half-playful vein to the affairs of every-day life that caught the attention and stimulated the imagination of young
Doyle	PERSON	, although Dr.
Bell	PERSON	himself is said to have deprecated the notoriety thus thrust upon him as the alleged model of
Holmes	LOCATION	, and to have maintained that his use of the observing faculty was no more than could be learned from any good manual of general medical practice .

		Of course it was also possible for the novelist to get from
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's '' Zadig , '' or even from earlier sources , the sugges - tion of his acutely - observant detective ; but it was undoubtedly from the later exponent of the '' method of Zadig '' that he derived his inspiration .

		ILLUSTRATIONS WHICH DO NOT ILLUSTRATE , such as too often mar one 's enjoyment of a good story or novel , were made the subject of a rather unusual but extremely effective protest in an instance cited by the public librarian of
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	'' Rot - ten pictures and they spoiled the whole story , so I took them all out , '' was found pencilled in a firm THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, hand over the '' list of illustrations '' in the library copy of a certain popular novel .

		Examination showed that all the thirteen plates had indeed been neatly removed for the benefit of subsequent read - ers .

		The abstraction of book-illustrations from pub - lic library volumes is no new thing , but seldom is it undertaken from so altruistic a motive .

		Fortunately for novel-readers , the graphic delineation of the emo - tions of hero and heroine is far less often attempted now than formerly ; and even some novels that are provided with pictures upon their first publication in serial form are later relieved of the encumbrance when issued as books .

		The truth is that readers like to imagine for themselves the personal appear - ance of the characters in a story , and the obtrusion of pretended portraits of them often produces dis - illusionment and disappointment , if not disgust .

		THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF A POPULAR NOVEL is a matter of curious interest .

		The pub - lishers of '' Queed , '' a novel which reached an issue of fifty thousand almost at a bound , and is climbing rapidly toward the hundred-thousand mark , have put out an interesting statement of '' How the first 50,000 ' Queed ' were distributed among the differ - ent cities . ''

		It is to be noted that
London	LOCATION	took five thousand copies ,
Boston	LOCATION	six thousand seven hun - dred ,
New York	LOCATION	not far from twenty thousand , and other places proportionately to their population , with some noteworthy exceptions .

		For example ,
Toronto	LOCATION	disposed of one thousand copies , whereas
Baltimore	LOCATION	, of more than twice its size , and next door to the author 's own
State	ORGANIZATION	, contented itself with four hundred and thirty .


Richmond	LOCATION	, where Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	lives and where he wrote the book , called for only five hundred and thirty copies perhaps , however , a greater mark of honor than most pro- phets receive in their own country .

		A similar state - ment of geographical distribution is to be made when the sales of '' Queed '' have actually reached a hundred thousand copies .

		CENSORIAL FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES , in respect to the admission or exclusion of current fiction of doubtful morality , have again been made a subject for discussion in a convention of libra - rians this time at
Perth	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, where the
British Library Association	ORGANIZATION	lately held its annual session .

		The head of the
Manchester Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is reported as expressing himself in favor of this exercise of censorship , but others maintained that no single person or institution had any right to compile an index expurgatorius for the general public .

		One speaker advocated the extreme measure of barring all works of fiction until a considerable lapse of time had determined their status .

		But what should be the length of this probationary period ?

		and by what visible or invisible marks could the worthy be then distinguished from the unworthy novels ?

		As is inevitable in every debate on this vexed question , there was much beating of the air on the part of the disputants at
Perth	LOCATION	.

		ORIGIN OF `` A
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	LAWYER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The reviewer of Mr.
Charles Warren	PERSON	's '' History of the American Bar , '' in THE DIAL of
Sept. 16	DATE	, says : '' It rather amusingly shows that as early as
1710	DATE	, long before the '
Philadelphia	LOCATION	lawyer ' had become a proverb for unscrupulous shrewdness , the professional pleader was often looked upon askance by his worthy neighbors . ''

		This conveys an entire misconception of the term '' a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	lawyer . ''

		The biography of
John Dickinson	PERSON	, author of the famous '' Letters of a
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania Farmer , '' by
Charles J. Stille	PERSON	, at one time Provost of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, makes plain that the high standing of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	lawyer of the Colonial period was due to the fact that the standards of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	bar were established and maintained by the large number of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	lawyers who studied at
the London Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		From that early period until a very recent time , the lawyer in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was the leader of public opinion in mat - ters social and political .

		As Dr.
Stillfe	PERSON	pointed out , the leadership exercised by the minister in
New England	LOCATION	fell naturally to the lawyer in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and he held it until the recent enormous extension of industrial fortunes .

		The term ''
Philadelphia	LOCATION	lawyer , '' instead of being a term of reproach as your reviewer indicates , was one that conveyed an appreciation of the leader - ship of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	bar expressed even at this late day by the query , `` Who is the greatest lawyer in
New York	LOCATION	? ''

		and the answer , ''

		DR. JOHN BASCOM A TRIBUTE .

		-LRB- `` To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the person of
John Bascom	PERSON	, who died
October 2	DATE	,
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	lost one of its most eminent gradu - ates and beloved teachers ,
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	an ex-president to whom it owes much of its wonderful growth , and the public a useful citizen and patriot .

		In his eighty-fifth year , Dr.
Bascom	PERSON	kept the heart and the courage of a youth , and with the youth of three generations he kept constantly in touch , so that those who knew him only as the '' grand old doctor '' on the shadowy side of the valley were as much his friends as were his college chums in the forties .

		Professor
Bascom	PERSON	was graduated from
Williams	ORGANIZATION	in
1849	DATE	, and from that time till 1874 he served his alma mater as professor of rhetoric , accepting in that year the presidency of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The guiding spirit of my time , '' says Senator
LaFollette	PERSON	, `` and the man to whom the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	owes a debt greater than it can overpay , was its president ,
John Bascom	PERSON	.

		I never saw
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, but I should say that
John Bascom	PERSON	was a man of much his type , both in appearance and in character .

		... It was his teaching , iterated and reiterated , of the obligation of both the university and the students , that may be said to have originated the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	idea in education .

		He was forever tell - ing us what the state was doing for us , and urging our return obligation not to use our education wholly for our own selfish benefit , but to return some service to the state .

		That teaching animated and inspired hun - dreds of students who sat under
John Bascom	PERSON	. ''

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 Not only at
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, but at
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, did Dr.
Baseom	PERSON	's earnest teaching point out to many a man his civic duty ; for in
1887	DATE	he returned to his alma mater , and taught actively till
1903	DATE	, when he became profes - sor emeritus .

		In many ways and in many fields his influence was powerful in moulding public opinion , notably , in his latter years , by a score of books on vari - ous phases of -LCB- esthetics , political economy , philosophy , and religion .

		He held honorary degrees from
Williams	ORGANIZATION	,
Amherst	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		Notwithstanding his scholarly activities , Dr.
Bascom	PERSON	was never a recluse .

		When well past eighty , his figure was a familiar sight as he walked the beloved roads of the beautiful college town in which life was better worth the living for him for his interest and energy in the community life .

		Seldom do the students doff their hats nowadays to professors , but they stood bare - headed in admiration and veneration as he rode by on horseback .


Williams	ORGANIZATION	, as the mother of many who have attained eminence , must place the name of
John Bascom	PERSON	close beside that of

		OCCULTISM AND PRACTICAL LIFE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a recent book entitled '' She
Buildeth Her House	ORGANIZATION	, '' the author , Mr.
Will Levington Comfort	PERSON	, voices a pow - erful warning against two evils that have arisen in our social system , both of which menace our country 's wel - fare .

		Both of these evils hinge somewhat upon the word `` occultism '' ; and in order to appreciate them at their full value one must first consider tdie meaning of the word .

		`` Occultism , `` according to the dictionary , means `` the investigation of any mysterious things , especially those that are supernatural . ''

		Another definition states that occultism is '' the real science of things now unknown to uninitiated humanity . ''

		Hence it is that while the majority of mankind are quite unaware of the nature of occult knowledge , the fact that such a body of knowl - edge exists is evidenced by the frequent efforts of unprincipled people to foist upon the public certain valueless information under the guise of occult truths .

		In every domain of thought the appearance of the false presupposes the existence of the true .

		One who possesses true occult knowledge will not divulge it for the purpose of receiving monetary consideration ; in other words , when a man is fitted by the stage of his evolution to be entrusted with occult secrets , they are imparted to him '' without money and without price , '' and he is pledged not to reveal them .

		Notwithstanding this , it is painfully true that a vain and credulous audience awaits any foreign psychical mountebank who comes to our shores driven from his own country , in many instances , by his outrageous moral conduct .

		Women who were once comely , and with increasing age have lost that claim to the attention of others , flock around a man of this sort , and feed their vanity on his assurance that they are spiritually far in advance of their neighbors .

		He filches their pockets , makes them dissatisfied with their lives , and sustains their assumption of condescending superiority , which is especially unbearable since it is always in evidence in those who have least claim to true spiritual advancement .

		Nor is this the greatest of his offenses .

		To young women whose physical attractions appeal to his inborn and dominating sensuality , he presents another phase .

		These are women usually of a devotional temperament , and the credulity of youth leads them to think they can learn the way of righteousness from him .

		He deliber - ately plays upon their highest and loftiest emotions ; he represents himself as their Guru , or Teacher , the link between them and the beloved Master ; by slow grada - tions and diabolical patience he brings them to a point where they believe they must sacrifice their virtue in order to advance further spiritually .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	does not exaggerate when he depicts a man of this type as presenting to an innocent young girl the idea of be - coming the mother of the coming Christ ; he merely shows himself conversant with the news of the day .

		The men of our country should take this matter in hand .

		They should refuse to allow a man of this stamp to speak in their parlors , and should make it impossible for him to rent a room in which he advertises to teach -LRB- for financial compensation -RRB- '' the higher truths of the spiritual life , '' '' the secret of eternal life , '' or anything occult , impossible , and invariably fraudulent , as we have endeavored to show .

		And they should not permit their wives or daughters to contribute to the support of such a character , or to come under his influence in any way .

		The second and more prevalent evil of which Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	speaks is the inharmony existing in the mar - riage relation which is constantly illustrated in the busy divorce courts of our country .

		And for the reason of this we must look to the occult or hidden side of man .

		The development of the Ego which is encouraged more here than in any other country by reason of our democracy is the cause of much inharmony in the early stages of evolution .

		Inharmony arising from the insistent assertion of one 's personality , to the entire ex - clusion of the rights of others , is almost a certain indi - cation that a man is not far advanced in the path of spiritual development .

		One can not afford to be arbitrary in a matter of well-nigh national interest , but it seems safe to say that , generally speaking , a divorce usually separates two unevolved persons .

		And the careful stat - istician may sometime be able to prove that a man of genius who stoops to avail himself of the divorce court as a means of freedom from the marital tie has usually achieved his greatest work before this occurs , and that all he does thereafter is nothing but an imitation of the excellent work done before .

		Decadence , either ethically or intellectually , or both , not infrequently follows upon divorce in the case of one or both parties .

		Observation discloses the fact that children born into inharmonious homes start life with a terrible handicap .

		The statistics of reform schools show that seventy-four per cent of the inmates of such institutions come from unhappy and inharmonious homes ; and the personal ex - perience of teachers and of the guards and wardens of our penal institutions show that about ninety per cent of the inmates of reform schools later in life serve one or more terms in the penitentiary ; for reform schools , as they are now conducted , do not and can not reform .

		A little less anxiety over the '' race suicide '' question , and more attention to furnishing favorable surroundings for the child during the formative years of his life , will manifest definite results in producing children without criminal tendencies as well as children able to control their emotions as they come to years of maturity .

Oct. 16	DATE	, A GREAT AMERICAN STORY-WRITER .

		* The nine years since
Bret Harte	PERSON	's death have produced several more or less hasty or incom - plete accounts of his life and work , such as Mr.
T. Edgar Peraberton	PERSON	's highly readable biography of his friend , which appeared the year after his death , and Mr.
Henry W. Boyn	PERSON	- ton 's fine appreciation of his genius , in the '' Contemporary Men of Letters '' series ; but it has been reserved for Mr.
Henry Childs Merwin	PERSON	, whose biographies of
Burr	PERSON	and
Jeffer	PERSON	- son attest his ability to perform the task , to make a thorough study of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's ante - cedents , early education or lack thereof , juvenile escapades , adolescent strivings , various wander - ings , and final achievement of assured success in his own peculiar department of literature .

		The results of this careful research , set forth in a compactly-printed octavo of three hundred and sixty-two pages , embellished with appropri - ate illustrations and provided with a sufficiency of explanatory footnotes , form a work of unusual attractiveness and of permanent value .

		Even that necessary evil of biography , a preliminary genealogical chapter , becomes in Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	's hands a blessing to the reader interested in tracing to their sources those traits of character that made
Bret Harte	PERSON	the fascinat - ing and gifted man we know him to have been .

		On both sides he came of ancestors endowed with distinctive qualities .

		The strain of Hebrew blood , which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	never wearied of insisting was to be found in all great men , came to
Bret Harte	PERSON	through his paternal grandfather ,
Bernard Hart	PERSON	-LRB- the final e dates back only to the novelist 's father 's last year of life -RRB- , who was born in Lon - don , but came to
Canada	LOCATION	as a boy of thirteen to seek his fortune .

		He did not lack for kins - folk in the new country , the Harts appearing to be both a prolific and an adventurous race .

		One of
Bernard Hart	PERSON	's cousins , we are informed , left behind him at his death no fewer than four - teen families of his own propagating , '' all estab - lished in the world with a good degree of comfort , and with a sufficient degree of respectability . ''

		The
Bret	PERSON	, or more properly
Brett	PERSON	, addition to the
Hart	PERSON	stock came in the person of

		only child of their union ,
Henry	PERSON	, the father of
Francis Brett Hart	PERSON	, or
Bret Harte	PERSON	, as he soon caused himself to be called .

		The mother of the boy destined to add lustre to the family name was left a widow after fifteen years of wandering and troubled life with her rather eccentric husband , a schoolteacher of migratory habits and a man of considerable learning .

		A passage from Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	's book will convey a notion of the haphazard existence to which
Bret Harte	PERSON	became early accustomed . ''

		A few years before her death Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	read the life of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	, and when she laid down the book she remarked that the troubles and privations endured by the
Alcott	PERSON	family bore a striking resemblance to those which she and her children had undergone .

		Some want of balance in
Henry Hart	PERSON	's character prevented him , notwithstanding his undoubted talents , his enthu - siasm , and his accomplishments , from ever obtaining any material success in life , or even a home for his family and himself .

		But he was a man of warm im - pulses and deep feelings .

		When
Henry Clay	PERSON	was nomi - nated for the Presidency in
1844	DATE	,
Henry Hart	PERSON	espoused his cause almost with fury .

		He gave up all other em - ployment to electioneer in behalf of the Whig candi - date , and the defeat of his idol was a crushing blow from which he never recovered ... and his death a year later , in
1845	DATE	, may justly be regarded as a really noble ending to a troubled and unsuccessful life . ''

		It is to the eldest of the four
Harte	PERSON	children ,
Eliza	PERSON	, now Mrs.
Knaufft	PERSON	, that the author is indebted for many facts in the history of the family that are new to us and most welcome .

		Of the two brothers ,
Henry	PERSON	and
Francis	PERSON	, the former might have distinguished himself as signally as his younger brother , had he not been cut off almost upon the threshold of his promis - ing young manhood .

		Precocity marked both boys , and
Francis	PERSON	, being incapacitated for active sports from his sixth to his tenth year , fell to reading Shakespeare before he was seven , and followed him with
Dickens	PERSON	, Fielding , Gold - smith ,
Smollett	PERSON	,
Cervantes	PERSON	, and
Washington Irving	LOCATION	.

		An illness of two months in his fifteenth year was beguiled with the study of Greek , which he learned to read sufficiently to astonish his mother .

		Of this home initiation into litera - ture we read further : '' If the
Hart	PERSON	family resembled the
Alcott	PERSON	family in the matter of misfortunes and privations , so it did , also , in its intellectual atmosphere .

		Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	shared her husband 's passion for literature ; and she had a keen critical faculty , to which , the family think ,
Bret Harte	PERSON	was much indebted for the perfection of his style .


Henry Hart	PERSON	had accumulated a library surprisingly large for a man of his small means , and the whole household was given to the reading not simply of books , but of the best books , and to talking about them .

		It was a household in which the literary second-rate was unerringly , and somewhat scornfully , discriminated from the first-rate . ''

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 291 The mother 's caustic criticism of her younger son 's first essays in metrical composition was so unsparing that the writer afterward wondered how he had ever dared to continue writing verse and even to publish it .

		It was in
1867	DATE	-LRB- not in
1865	DATE	, as he himself says -RRB- that the first collec - tion of these poems was issued in book form . ''

		The Lost Galleon and Other Tales '' was the book 's title , and Tame and
Bacon	PERSON	, of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, were the printers .

		A year later '' The Overland Monthly '' was started by
Anton Roman	PERSON	, with
Bret Harte	PERSON	as its editor .

		Indeed , the very name of the magazine was of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's selection , and the familiar design on its cover the grizzly bear bestriding a piece of railroad track was partly of his own sugges - tion .

		The bear had been cut and printed , but the picture lacked point and meaning until the young editor drew some criss-cross lines under the animal 's feet , which converted the whole into a telling symbol of
California	LOCATION	savagery snarling at the approaching type of nineteenth - century civilization , the steam locomotive .

		If genius has ever found its most congenial environment , surely
Bret Harte	PERSON	was rightly placed when he found himself in the
California	LOCATION	of half a century ago , with all its picturesque variety of life and its contempt for the conven - tions .

		A judge of the
Santa Cruz County	LOCATION	court kept a hotel , and after court had adjourned he might be seen in his shirt-sleeves waiting on his guests at table , serving jurors , attorneys , crim - inals , and sheriffs , with a truly judicial impar - tiality .

		A
Yale	ORGANIZATION	graduate sold peanuts for a livelihood on the Plaza at
San Francisco	LOCATION	, while an erstwhile
Yale	ORGANIZATION	professor hauled freight with a yoke of oxen .

		A doctor of medicine washed dishes in a restaurant , an ex-governor scraped the fiddle in a bar-room , a lawyer maintained a mush-and-milk stand , another sold pies at a river-crossing , a third drove a team of mules , and an Oxford senior wrangler filled the humble role of boatman .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	shows his famil - iarity with
Bret Harte	PERSON	's stories by introducing many quotations and allusions in his survey of the rude condition of
California	LOCATION	in the fifties .

		Upon
Harte	PERSON	's leaving the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , in
1871	DATE	, he proceeded first to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and thence to
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		His desultory life during the seven years before he entered the consular service is disposed of by his biographer in a single short chapter .

		Then follow chapters on ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	at Crefeld , '' ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, '' ``
Bret Harte	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	, '' and , finally , four short chapters of literary criticism , or rather appreciation , dealing with ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	as a Writer of Fiction '' and ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	as a Poet , '' ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	's Pioneer Dia - lect , '' and ''
Bret Harte	PERSON	's Style . ''

		The narrative and descriptive portions of the book constitute its bulk and give the work its character .

		And yet Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	's appreciation of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's literary genius is not lacking in warmth or in discernment .

		Let us quote from his remarks on the novelist 's style . ''

		One other characteristic of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's style , and indeed of any style which ranks with the best , is obvi - ous , and that is subtlety .

		It is the office of a good style to express in some indefinable manner those nuances which mere words , taken by themselves , are not fine enough to convey .

		Thoughts so subtle as to have almost the character of feelings ; feelings so well defined as just to escape being thovights ; attractions and repul - sions ; those obscure movements of the intellect of which the ordinary man is only half conscious until they are revealed to him by the eye of genius ; all these things it is a part of style to express , or at least to imply .

		Subtlety of style presupposes , of course , subtlety of thought , and possibly also subtlety of perception .

		Certainly
Bret Harte	PERSON	had both of these capacities ; and many examples might be cited of his minute and sym - pathetic observation .

		For instance , although he had no knowledge of horses , and occasionally betrays his ignor - ance in this respect , yet he has described the American trotter with an accuracy which any technical person might envy . ''

		Then follows an admirably illustrative passage from '' Through the
Santa Clara Wheat	LOCATION	, '' where we are told how '' the driver leaned for - ward and did something with the reins Rose never could clearly understand what , though it seemed to her that he simply lifted them with ostentatious lightness ; but the mare suddenly seemed to lengthen herself and lose her height , and the stalks of wheat on either side of the dusty track began to melt into each other , and then slipped like a flash into one long , continu - ous , shimmering green hedge . ''

		It will be long before
Bret Harte	PERSON	's life will have to be told again in detail , so thoroughly has his latest biographer performed the task .

		We are glad to have so much that has been obscure or puzzling in that rather erratic life placed in orderly sequence by this careful pen .

		The precautions adopted by the writer to ensure accuracy , and which are touched upon in his preface , inspire confidence in the authenticity of his statements .

		The date of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's birth , which Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	states as
1839	DATE	, with consequent unaccountable discrepancies , is more credibly given by Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	as
1836	DATE	.

		For combined trustworthiness and readability his book must commend itself to all who give themselves the pleasure and profit of its perusal .

		292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ITALIAN PROBLEMS OF WAR AXD PEACE .

		* Now that
Italy	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	are facing each other in hostile array at
Tripoli	LOCATION	, and the world 's eyes are concentrated on every move that
Italy	LOCATION	is making to annex the vilayet which has been the goal of her
Mediterranean	LOCATION	policy for so many years , everything relating to Italian conditions , social , political , and military , is of keen interest .

		We know little of these matters ; nor is it easy to learn more .

		What
Italy	LOCATION	has given us in the past , the debt we owe to her and to
Greece	LOCATION	for the foundations of our culture , are familiar to everyone .

		But the task that she has accom - plished in the last two score of years in forming one nation and one government from many het - erogeneous if not conflicting elements , how she has invalidated forever the pertinence of Prince
Metternich	PERSON	's characterization of the country as '' a geographical expression , '' what is her pres - ent position in the world of European thought and life , of these things most of us are more or less ignorant .


Carducci	PERSON	's phrase '' The Third
Italy	LOCATION	'' was so happy that it has come into gen - eral adoption .

		The first
Italy	LOCATION	conquered the whole of the known world ; the second was over - run , subdued , and partitioned by barbarians ; the third is that free
Italy	LOCATION	with which we are more or less familiar .

		A book about this
Third Italy	LOCATION	, purporting to be written by a Yankee living in
Rome	LOCATION	, in the form of letters to his friends in
America	LOCATION	, though published some years ago , is only just now trans - lated into English .

		There are nineteen of these letters , and they are as outspoken about
Italy	LOCATION	as the somewhat similar `` Letters of a Chinese Official '' were about
England	LOCATION	.

		The American reader is not slow in discovering that the `` Yankee '' of these letters is not the real thing , but an Italian who knows things from the inside and would hardly dare to speak in his own person .

		Very few of the Italian reviews , however , pen - etrated the disguise ; the book passed through three editions , and a subscription was raised whereby each of the 508 deputies in the Italian Parliament was presented with a copy .

		As the American translator points out , '' The compari - son the writer draws between what has been done in our country in contrast to
Italy	LOCATION	is so flattering that whilst reading it the American eagle in each one of us involuntarily flaps his wings . ''

		At some other time , perhaps the most en - grossing of these letters would be those dealing * THE NEW
ITALY	LOCATION	.

		A Discussion of its Present Political and Social Conditions .

		Translated from
La Terza Italia	ORGANIZATION	: Lettere di un

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		with such subjects as '' The Preparation of the New Capital , '' `` Education and Art , '' `` The Mafia and Lynch Law , '' '' Literature and the Press , '' '' Family Life , '' etc. .

		But at the pres - ent moment we are more concerned with the discussion of the state of the army and the military spirit .

		The writer calls attention to the fact that for the last forty years all Italian campaigns have ended in disaster , and there has been a great decline in the military spirit . ''

		An army is no good if it is not animated by mili - tary spirit .

		Cannon are useless hunks of bronze if not manoeuvred by a valiant and spirited artillery .

		There is no necessity to cultivate militarism ; but there is , to see to it that every good son of
Italy	LOCATION	should have the consciousness of belonging to a great nation , and should be determined , at the supreme moment , heroically to do his whole duty ...
Italy	LOCATION	is fortunate in having a well-disciplined army , though perhaps in danger of being too much disciplined , should that discipline be con - strued in a way that would turn it into a menace of suffocation rather than a revivifying force .

		The Italian officers are for the most part good fellows a little limited sometimes in their ideas , not so much because they do not study , as because they do not know the world ; there is not one in ten who has ever set his foot outside his own country , their financial condition does not enable them to do so , but they are profoundly devoted to their flag , and most enthusiastic in the per - formance of their duties .

		If they were allowed to go ahead a little themselves , if the
Central Government	ORGANIZATION	would yield them a little larger sphere of action , and would give them a little more of what we call ' elbow room , ' it seems to me they would form an element which could be counted on with confidence . ''

		Still more pertinent is the chapter on '' Col - onies and * Irredentismos ' '' the latter word being applied to certain portions of the national territory still remaining under foreign domina - tion , such as Trent and
Trieste	LOCATION	.

		At this mo - ment it would be idle to attempt to foresee the outcome of the struggle in
North Africa	LOCATION	.

		But it is not premature to ask what
Italy	LOCATION	will be likely to do with
Tripoli	LOCATION	now that it has fallen into her hands .

		If , with or without compensation to the excluded Turks ,
Italy	LOCATION	shall be left in possession there , it will then be incumbent upon the new masters of the province to justify their occu - pation by making their rule acceptable to the Arabs , and by bringing security , order , and prosperity to the country .

		Previous attempts by
Italy	LOCATION	in colonial undertakings have been conspicuous failures ; is she likely to succeed when she faces the actual problem of extending her influence beyond the coast line ?

		Concern - ing this , our author says : '' Italians have been unfortunate , it is true ; but it will not do to think that other countries have gotten their colonies for nothing .

		... To make herself mis - tress of so large a portion of the world ,
England	LOCATION	for more than three hundred years has been at war on land

		THE DIAL , 293 and sea .

		It was a great shame that immediately after the constitution of the Kingdom no great statesman should have thought of the future , and the absolute necessity that
Italy	LOCATION	should have some outlets in her own possession .

		There would have been many more of these outlets than there now are , and they would have been much more easily acquired .

		... At all events , so long as
Italy	LOCATION	has no vast colony of her own adapted to her inhabitants , she is much in the position of a man with an incurable disease , who loses every day a part of his blood and his strength .

		How sad is the perennial exodus of thousands upon thousands of poor peasants , who leave a land incapable of nourishing them , and go far away to an unknown world whose name they can scarcely pronounce , and where most of them will be given over to a life of privation and desolation ...
Italy	LOCATION	will never suffice to the needs of her already dense and con - stantly increasing population .

		If
Italy	LOCATION	should entirely devote herself to the improvement of her lands , the problem of over-population , which is for any country one of the most terrible , might be deferred for some years ; but it would be bound to rise up later , ever graver and more threatening . ''

		No wonder , then , that
Italy	LOCATION	, having made up her mind to possess herself of
Tripoli	LOCATION	and to forestall the French from further extension of their colonies in
North Africa	LOCATION	, has seized on the first opportune occasion to take the decisive step .

		Whether she has fully counted the after - costs of the enterprise upon which she has adven - tured , or has weighed the possible complications in the inevitable process of adjustment , may be gravely doubted .

		In the mean time readers of this trenchant book on '' The
New Italy	LOCATION	'' will infer that the greatest obstacle to be encountered will be the home elements , anti-military and socialistic , among whom the feeling prevails that the
Italian Government	ORGANIZATION	has enough to do toward the amelioration of industrial and social conditions in its own immediate boundaries with - out undertaking foreign conquests .

		ANNA BENNESON McMAHAN .

		THE MESSAGE OF Music .

		* The subject of apologetics is just as import - ant in art as it is in religion .

		In the case of music it still seems to a certain degree neces - sary to make a special plea for its acceptance among the serious concerns of life .

		This is no doubt partly due to the behavior of musicians themselves .

		The old conflict between the for - malists and the expressionists still has some - thing of its pristine rancor .

		Notwithstanding the achievements of
Schumann	PERSON	and Liszt and
Brahms	PERSON	, we are still more or less required to assure mankind that music , the latest of the * THE PHILOSOPHY OF Music .

New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		arts , has come into the world for the purifica - tion and enlightenment of men , as have her great sisters who preceded her .

		The work of Professor Britan on '' The Philosophy of Music '' is qualified to accom - plish much in this direction .

		Its title should not act as a deterrent to anyone .

		When Phi - losophy assumes the simple garb which she here wears , when she speaks in language so direct and alluring , she has ceased to be harsh and crabbed , and may be welcomed as one who has a message to bring that is well worth the hear - ing .

		If music needed any apologia pro vita sua -LRB- and the time has certainly arrived when such apology is superseded by a discussion of its nature , methods , and significance -RRB- one will find the difficult work happily done in
Professor Britan	LOCATION	's book .

		In an opening chapter the author explains at some length how music has arisen in all ages and climes , showing a universality beyond that of almost any other art except poetry ; how music has lent itself to the expression of emotion with remarkable versatility , and has produced its wonders with a power that has held the listener captive .

		He then outlines the subject of musi - cal form , but without going into its intricacies .

		One envisages , however , the creative achieve - ments of the composer who erects his musical structures with great architectural skill .

		The world of music emerges into view , and we ask ourselves of what import are these varied and myriad voices decisively blended and evidently eager to arouse the dormant will or to soothe and allay where a mood is too insistent and on the verge of dangerous excess .

		The investigation proceeds with the organiza - tion of the chaotic ocean of sound .

		The struggle upward to the disclosure of the scale , and the differentiation of this latter into its many possi - bilities , are brought to our view .

		Then the basic concern of rhythm , with its roots firmly established in the historic process of the race , receives a sufficient analysis .

		Rhythm has to do with the original solidarity of mankind , and its convincing employment by music at once allies the art with that movement which has meant the increasing consciousness of the need and value of civilization .

		Then follows the formation of the melody , the rise of the artistic form which music is especially to claim as its The material which Music and its con - own .

		gener Poetry use differs from that of the other arts .

		In the latter the material is already ex - tant : stone and paint are not far to seek any - where ; but language and ordered sound are 294 -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, products of man 's activity .

		Music and poetry belong wholly to mankind , and therefore admit of a fulness , a richness , and an intimacy of expression which place them by themselves .

		Then the combination of tones , the capital achievement of harmony , makes a further step in the progress ; this advances from its elaborate and yet artificial contrapuntal stages through an intermediate one of an equal distribution of voices into its final unification of free melodies in massive and significant effects .

		If we then ask ourselves what content or meaning has been poured into these efforts , which have occupied the serious attention of so many men of the highest type for such pro- tracted periods , we have only to look at the works of the masters for a reply .

		Palestrina has given expression to the mystical revelations of the
Mediaeval Church	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bach	PERSON	to the hopes and aspirations of the Reformation ; in
Beethoven	LOCATION	, as in his friend and contemporary Goethe , the modern consciousness finds all its restless questionings struggling on to solution ; in
Wagner	PERSON	the drama leaps into a new life , like the Renaissance achievement in the great times of
England	LOCATION	's
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		The art is distinctly the modern art ; its accomplishments are those of our own time .

		Of all the arts it is the one now most alive , and attaining its maturity ; and the men on the stage seem to be carrying for - ward the work of their predecessors .

		But harmony has additional complications ; in the orchestra the instruments have their special peculiarities ; the strings differenced among themselves are as a whole differenced from the wind instruments , which also separate into varieties in their own domain ; and the percus - sion instruments have their tone-color and their capabilities of rhythmic emphasis , while above the whole soar the human voices with their far-reaching distinctiveness .

		If to these are added the intricacies of the modern drama , with its opportunities in the way of scenic pre - sentation , enlisting poetry and painting and sculpture and architecture , we have
Richard Wagner	PERSON	's ideal of a work which is the united expression of the arts .

		Music has the closest affiliations with litera - ture .

		As Professor
Britan	LOCATION	says : '' The exceptional influence which certain forms of literature exert upon the human mind e. g. , the novel and the drama well confirms our point as a positive example of the principles which give music its power .

		Aa
Lessing	PERSON	long ago explained , literature is peculiarly adapted to express ideas in which there is development from moment to moment .

		It conforms to the natural process of thought , and so is adapted to express thought relations .

		Literature , therefore , is to be classed with music as an art adapted to carry the mind into emotional climaxes of great intensity and force ... But even as compared with literature , music in one respect stands superior ; the dynamic similarity of literature to the emo - tional life is confined chiefly to the thought content , in music it extends even to the elements of its sensuous expression ... Music in its symbolism , both in the thought content and in its sensuous factors employed , conforms closely to the laws of emotional reactions .

		This symbolism therefore makes a direct and a tremendous appeal to the emotional consciousness .

		Thus it is that music ranks in power with the most powerful forms of the literary art , and in some respects surpasses it in the directness and immediacy of its appeal . ''

		Professor
Britan	LOCATION	has made an interesting and valuable presentation of his subject ; it has taken the form of a series of lectures , rather than a systematic and scientific exposition such as Professor Combarieu 's work on '' Music : Its Laws and Evolution , '' reviewed in these pages some little time ago .

		Perhaps , however , such treatment will only add to the strength of its appeal to the general reader , and assure the book the wide circulation which it ought to have .

		The publishers have given it the fine garb which we have learned to expect from them .

		THE INTEREST OP
INDIA	LOCATION	.

		* Americans are beginning to do decidedly more reading about British
India	LOCATION	.

		The incentives range from the deeper and more definite concern with oriental world-politics that followed our acquisition of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, to the picturesqueness of the Delhi durbars , the readability of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	at his best , or the number of our missionaries .

		The only surprise is that the growth of active interest has been so slow ; for it is inconceivable that anybody should fail to find something to attract and hold him , if he will ever glance at that incredible penin - sula .

		Nor should this dangerously comprehensive statement be narrowed by limiting its application to students of art , or philosophy , or ethnology , or religion , or history , or government .

		It is obvious that all these must find a rich and even boundless field in
India	LOCATION	; but for other less exalted mortals the attractiveness is just as compelling .

		For instance , a sturdy
New Zealand	LOCATION	traveller on the
Pacific	LOCATION	said to me : '' I do n't care a straw about architecture or that sort of rot , but the

		THE DIAL 295 can woman declared that any railway station in
India	LOCATION	was better than the best circus in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Occasionally , it is true , you meet the crea - ture who sees in
Benares	LOCATION	not the '' Oxford and Mecca of
Hinduism	LOCATION	, '' not the most striking river front in the world , with its combination of '' temples , palaces , pinnacles , shrines , towers , and minarets , '' but simply the dirtiest and worst-smelling city on the globe .

		However , such a person is rare ; and if one finds no joy in
Benares	LOCATION	, there remain the villages , the plains , the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, the birds , the beasts ,
Agra	LOCATION	,
Udaipur	LOCATION	,
Delhi	LOCATION	, and
Amber	ORGANIZATION	, a thousand sources of pleasure .

		Only one visitor have I ever met who felt discontent with everything ; but he was an elderly American millionaire travelling in his private car , and his own charming wife smiled upon him with an infinite pity that he could not comprehend .

		It has been definitely determined that
King George	PERSON	will hold a coronation durbar at
Delhi	LOCATION	next
winter	DATE	; and it will be the only regal function I should decidedly care to see .

		Of all the splendid and picturesque pageants in the history of the world , this may be the most picturesque and splendid .

		The palace of the Moghul emperors in itself seemed to me worth a trip around the world ; and in the old imperial surroundings East and West will meet in all the pomp and circumstance of war and peace .

		Here a foreigner from over the `` Black Water '' the mere crossing whereof involves almost inexpiable pollution for the Hindu will be crowned emperor of over three hundred and fifteen millions of people .

		In these millions will be included every stage of human development , from the most primitive , almost simian , savage to the purest blooded and most sophis - ticated Aryan .

		One must not think of
India	LOCATION	as a nation .

		It is no more a nation than is all
Europe	LOCATION	with half of
Africa	LOCATION	thrown in ; for you find just as fundamental differences among its various peoples and tribes as between the Cossack and the
Neapoli	PERSON	- tan , the cultured Parisian and the Nubian negro .


India	LOCATION	is a geographical expression , meaning a mil - lion and three-quarters of square miles of territory peopled
Jay	PERSON	such divergent inhabitants as I have suggested .

		Over this continent , with its teeming millions , it is the task of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to rule , and her success or failure is one of the most momentous questions ever presented to students of government .

		It is the question which Mr.
Price Collier	PERSON	pro- posed to answer in his work entitled '' The West in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		His volume is a beautiful example of an exceedingly readable book written by an able man who knows he has no particular right to be heard .

		Mr.
Collier	PERSON	spent six months in the country under the wing of government officials and maharajahs .

		With a brilliant journalistic instinct , he grasped a lot of essentials and proceeded to set them forth with a lot of interesting non-essentials and a number of perfectly obvious blunders .

		The result is one of the most provoking books a reviewer is called upon to examine .

		If one is at all familiar with
India	LOCATION	, one becomes irritated to a most unphilosophical de - gree by inaccuracies , by ill-grounded judgments , by the persistent injection of impertinent observations , and many similar defects ; but just at the point of explosion one is calmed by the thought of the general usefulness of the book and the validity of its more important conclusions .

		For instance , with reference to the success or failure of British rule in
India	LOCATION	, Mr.
Collier	PERSON	believes
England	LOCATION	is genuinely serving the cause of humanity and carrying out a superhuman task with superb devotion and astonish - ing success . ''

		There is no land , I believe , governed by such self-sacrificing rulers , and ruling over such ignorant multitudes . ''

		Again , he gives us this spicily worded bit : '' My own opinion as an observer from the outside is , that the peoples of
India	LOCATION	are no more fit for representative government than are the in - mates of a menagerie , and that were the British to leave
India	LOCATION	for three months ,
India	LOCATION	would resemble a circus tent in the dark , with the menagerie let loose inside . ''

		In a similar spirit he reads his fel - low countrymen a pointed and pertinent lecture on their maudlin sympathy with '' the so-called Indian patriots '' in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		But this attempt of the Brahman agitators to oust the British , or at all events to gain more offices , more authority and more power for themselves , is an effort to replace British control by the rule of the Brahman , which repre - sents the most tyrannical , the most un-American , and the most revolting social , religious , and political autocracy the world has ever seen .

		How any American , whatever his ideals or his sympathies , can lend his influence in support of a movement to increase the power of the Brahman caste in
India	LOCATION	, politically or otherwise , can only be explained on two grounds : he is either maliciously mischievous , or he is ignorant . ''

		The same high appreciation of British rule is seen in the chapter on Bunia-Pani , perhaps the best section of the book .

		With the general spirit of Mr.
Collier	PERSON	's conclusion , I am in most hearty accord ; and it is worth recalling that the two Frenchmen best qualified to write on
India	LOCATION	have spoken in a tone of approval almost as unqualified .

		This opinion receives strong confirmation from a new book diametrically the opposite of Mr.
Collier	PERSON	's .

		Sir
Andrew H. G. Fraser	PERSON	, the author of '' Among Indian Rajahs and Ryots , '' served the Crown for thirty years , including five years as Lieutenant - Governor of
Bengal	LOCATION	.

		In his octavo volume of reminiscences he has made no explicit claims for the success of British rule ; his aim is '' to convey some idea to the ordinary British imagination of the life we live in
India	LOCATION	, and of the peoples among whom that life is spent . ''

		But before the reader closes the book he will repeat once more , `` It is well that a nation is willing to give such sons to serve an alien people . ''

		In the author 's aim , as quoted above , he succeeds most admirably ; and one is carried from chapter to chapter with unflagging interest .

		We associate with European and Indian officers , as well as civilians .

		We are present at the complicated and bewildering operations of the law courts .

		We share the thrilling excitement of grain riots , or the san - guinary uprising of the Khonds .

		We watch the peasant in the field , and note the efforts of his rulers to save him from the money-lender .

		We are intro - 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, duced to the latest phases of the educational prob - lem and the political unrest .

		We smile with the humors of administration , or are carried off at Christmastide to share in the capture of a herd of wild elephants .

		At every turn we have the delight - ful feeling that our author knows whereof he speaks .

		The book is more human than
Lord Cromer	PERSON	's two volumes on
Egypt	LOCATION	, without being less authoritative .

		It can be recommended most cordially .

		Our third book , `` Jungle By - Ways in
India	LOCATION	. ''

		joins the preceding only in the paths of the jungle .

		I regret that my knowledge of hunting in
India	LOCATION	is limited to books and to tales of Indian acquaintances ; but Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	's unpretentious volume seems to me a model .

		It is the outcome of '' sixteen pleasant and interesting years in the
Indian Forest Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' and has all the freshness of notes and sketches made '' on the spot and at the time . ''

		The '' shikari '' will acknowledge a debt for the '' tracks '' of Indian game animals , as well as a lot of other information ; but any lover of wild life and of the open air will enjoy these three hundred pages on '' Antlers , '' '' Horns , '' and '' Pelts . ''

		The following passage from the preface reflects very accurately the spirit of the whole volume : '' It is an experience common to many true sportsmen , I believe , that they soon grow tired of the mere slaughter of the animals they go out to seek .

		Gradually the fascination of the jungle lays its hold upon them , and of the jungle - loving denizens .

		It becomes a pastime of absorbing interest to watch the life of the jungle in its daily round from early morn to dewy eve , and again in the solemn watches of the
night	TIME	.

		It becomes an ambition to learn from , and strive to emulate , the jungle man in his knowledge of all jungle lore , and to strive to pick up some of his marvelous tracking powers .

		Long years of close study , combined with an excep - tional aptitude for absorbing jungle lore , must be passed through before one can hope to even approach the powers in this respect of the jungle man .

		But what a store of glorious memories do such years contain !

		From such a store I have endeavored to depict the fund of pleasure , interest , and knowledge , let alone that breezy spice of danger which adds zest to all sport , which await the student of jungle life in the shimmering East . ''

		After reading these lines one is prepared for such a paragraph as this : `` Oh , the sunsets of the East !

		Can skill with pen or brush ever portray them in anything like their wonderful intensity ?

		Ephemeral they , for as one strives with strained and fixed gaze to take in all their beauty , lo !

		they change and melt , soften and disappear , and leave us with cold greys or blues or blacks . ''

		Nor does one need to be told how Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	en - joyed watching a leopard au naturel , and rejoiced that his gun had been left behind .

		I must note , too , that the author has a relieving sense of humor , seen , for example , in his very brief description of a run - away lunch-bearing elephant .

		The last of the volumes in our present group raises the knotty problem of the evangelization of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		If only
Benares	LOCATION	could be won for Christ , more than
Benares	LOCATION	would be won . ''

		The author is himself a missionary , and believes that the cross will triumph despite the modesty of its past achievements .

		This hopefulness is shared by Sir
Andrew Fraser	PERSON	, who believes that the outlook of Christianity in
India	LOCATION	was never so favorable as at present , and feels that '' the evangelization of its peoples is assured if the church in the West and the church in
India	LOCATION	are found alive to their responsibility and faithful to their duty . ''

		In another passage he pays a high tri - bute to the
Methodist Episcopal Church of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Collier	PERSON	, on the other hand , is openly skeptical as to the missionary movement .

		The missionaries , he says , '' have made practically no impression upon
India	LOCATION	, and the best of them , both European and native , admit as much themselves . ''

		I have quoted these contradictory opinions because they represent exactly what I found when visiting
India	LOCATION	.

		For every three men who told me the missionaries were accomplishing anything worth while , there were other three to enter a flat denial ; and how shall an outsider presume to judge between them ?

		This much , however , seems to be clear : that the Hindu is by nature better adapted to carry out the turn - the-other-cheek doctrine of Christianity than the occidental nations , who never dream of doing any - thing of the kind ; and that up to the present the converts have been practically limited to the lowest castes , or the out-castes .

		To me it would seem that , for the average Hindu , a Christian sect comes dangerously near to being nothing except a new caste or a substitute therefor ; and it is perfectly clear that the higher caste Hindus will always hold aloof as a class .

		Nor do I believe that any con - siderable headway will be made with the
Moham	PERSON	- medans .

		But I am in danger of giving the impression that Mr.
Cape	PERSON	, in his book on
Benares	LOCATION	, treats only of the missionary problem , which would be entirely misleading ; for he chats about all sorts of topics suggested by the sacred capital on the
Ganges	LOCATION	, such as `` The Monkey Temple , '' '' The Holy Man , '' `` Caste at Work , '' `` The Sacred Bull , '' or `` Benares Doms . ''

		Furthermore , he gives us a lot of excellent illustrations , and includes a number of Indian say - ings .

		Throughout the work , however , the point of view is frankly that of the missionary .

		In concluding this survey , I should like to return to the central question .

		The greatest problem in
India	LOCATION	is poverty : not lack of land , but lack of prop - erty .

		The next is government .

		Contrary to gen - eral belief , there is plenty of land even for the three hundred and fifteen millions shown by the last census .

		With irrigation , with improved agriculture , and with industrial development , the country may be raised , painfully and slowly , to comparative com - fort and even to comparative affluence if one emphasizes comparative .

		But it is safe to say that any amelioration will be indefinitely postponed if this geographical expression be treated as a nation and left to its own control .

		One must always re - member that there are many individuals of the highest type among the leading Mohammedans and Hindus ; but one must never forget that these are easily lost in the countless throng , and that the history of
India	LOCATION	has been the history of war and conquest , of blood and rapine .

		EVOLUTION : AS SPECULATION AND AS FACT .

		* In recent years speculative writings about Or - ganic Evolution have been rather heavily discounted in the biological market .

		New facts about Evolu - tion have been at a premium .

		It has not unreason - ably been insisted that if one desired a respectful hearing he must pretty well eschew those imagina - tive flights which added brilliancy , though not great illumination , to much of the early post-Darwinian discussion of the subject .

		It is remarkable how essentially similar all these speculative discussions are , when stripped of all accessory verbiage .

		Skele - tonized , the argument always runs about like this : `` Given ... etc. , it would necessarily follow that '' ... etc. '' Or if ... were as we plainly must conceive it to be , it might be that '' ... etc. '' But there can be no reasonable doubt that '' ... `` This being so we have proved that ... etc. ad lib .

		Q. E. D. '' The advance of biology by this method of research was so exceedingly slow as to bring the method itself into disrepute . ''

		Back to Nature '' became an absolutely imperative call , and has been productive of solid advances in our knowledge of the method of Evolution .

		These remarks are occasioned by the first book on our present list ,
Bernard	PERSON	's `` Neglected Factors in Evolution , '' which is by way of being a rever - sion to an extinct type .

		It is , in all essentials , purely speculative from cover to cover .

		The author , who before his death was for many years a member of the staff of the British Museum -LRB-
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , spent a good deal of time in studying the microscopic structure of the retina of the eye .

		He found there certain peculiar forms of protoplasm .

		Long con - tinued cogitation over these phenomena so magnified their seeming importance that finally the `` protomi - tomic net-work '' came to be for Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	the key which was to open all the dark recesses of the * SOME NEGLECTED FACTORS IN EVOLUTION .

		problems of Evolution .

		For their further clarifica - tion , the principle of '' cosmic rhythm '' was brought forth .

		With these as working tools , the whole course of Organic Evolution is reviewed and `` explained '' in a stout volume of nearly 500 pages .

		Since , how - ever , the '' explanation '' follows precisely the course of the skeletonized argument presented above , we are left no further forward than before .

		The book forms another shining example of the utter futility of the attempt to '' explain '' the relatively little we actually know about biology , in terms of the vast lot which we do not know .

		Willey 's '' Convergence in Evolution '' is a dif - ferent sort of book .

		It is essentially a critical digest of a wide range of facts bearing on what really is a somewhat `` neglected '' factor in
Evo	LOCATION	- lution namely , convergence .

		Briefly , the biologist means by `` convergence `` the phenomenon presented by two -LRB- or more -RRB- groups of animals which are not at all closely related genetically , but which never - theless have certain structures or organs that are similar , not only in form but in function as well .

		The cause of these '' convergent '' similarities is to be found , broadly speaking , in the action of like environmental forces upon organisms which , in spite of their difference of origin , are equally plastic and capable of being moulded under the stress of ex - ternal circumstances .

		The facts of convergence show plainly that there is always a tendency for living things to meet certain environmental de - mands in one general way .

		While cases of con - vergence have long been known ,
Willey	PERSON	's is the first extensive analytical study of the matter .

		It is a valuable contribution to biological literature , not only for the wealth of facts which it brings to - gether , many of which are new and come from the author 's own observations during several years ' resi - dence in the tropics , but also for the clear-cut way in which these data are brought together into a well - ordered whole , which forms convincing evidence of the importance of Convergent Evolution .

		As the body of knowledge comprised in any one of the sciences increases , there is created an almost continuous need for popular treatises which shall keep the general reader informed both as to the progress which is being made and also in regard to how the newly-gained knowledge dovetails into what has been known .

		In the case of evolutionary biology , such a need is particularly evident , because of the important part the evolution idea has come to have in all fields of contemporary thought .

		Hence it is that there is a tolerably steady output of brief popular summaries of Evolution , each a little '' better '' than its predecessor , because more accu - rately reflecting the immediately existing state of expert technical knowledge in the field , and each in turn to be supplanted by a later arrival .

		Two such treatises are included in our present budget : the book by Mr.
Henry E. Crampton	PERSON	, and that by Messrs.
Thomson	PERSON	and
Geddes	PERSON	.

		Both are excellent treatises .

		They are authoritative and clear , and present the essentials in a straightforward way calculated to 298 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, catch and hold the reader 's interest .

		Thomson and
Geddes	PERSON	follow closely the conventional lines for a work of this sort , presumably on account chiefly of the limitations of space prescribed in the '' Home University Library '' series of which their book forms a number .

		Mr.
Crampton	PERSON	devotes consider - able space to the discussion of the relation of
Evo	PERSON	- lution to social and religious problems .

		Neither of these books is illustrated , a rather serious defect in a popular introduction to Evolution .

		Some time ago the first volume of the English translation of De Vries 's '' Mutations theorie '' was reviewed in these columns .

		The second volume has now appeared .

		The work as a whole will always remain a classic of biological literature .

		Its original publication marked an epoch in the history of science .

		Whether or not all the ideas of De Vries stand the test of time , it will still be a fact that his work served as one of the primary stimuli which led biologists to take up the experimental study of evolution .

		What will be the end of the present great activity in this field of research , no one can foresee ; but it is certain that the data already accumulated have wonderfully widened and deep - ened our insight into some of the most fundamental of biological problems .

		To De Vries belongs the credit due a pioneer .

		Closely associated with the mutation theory in the history of modern biology is Mendelism .

		Varia - tion and heredity in general are really but two different aspects of the same fundamental phenom - enon .

		Mutation illustrates from the side of varia - tion the significance of discontinuity in Evolution , while the type of inheritance discovered by
Gregor Mendel	PERSON	in his monastery garden emphasizes the same thing on the heredity side .

		It has been well said that in the last analysis all knowledge must be individual .

		Until the rediscovery of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's laws , this is precisely what our knowledge of hered - ity had not been .

		It had been held impossible to predict from a knowledge of the parents what the individual offspring would be like .

		We could make a reasonable prediction of the '' average '' condition of the progeny , but not more .


Mendel	PERSON	's work showed that in peas , at least , one could with great precision foretell what the individual offspring of a particular mating would be like .

		In the
last ten years	DATE	the range of applicability of Mendelian principles has been enormously extended among both domesticated and wild animals and plants ; and the end is not yet .

		Naturally , such important and far-reaching discoveries have called forth many non-technical books for the lay reader .

		Two of these demand attention here .


Drinkwater	PERSON	's reprint of a lecture on Mendelism is a very brief outline of the subject , clearly written but not sufficiently ex - tensive to give any adequate idea of what has been done or of its significance .

		The booklet contains excellent portraits of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	,
Bateson	PERSON	, and
Punnett	PERSON	.

		Professor
R. C. Punnett	PERSON	, who has recently succeeded
Bateson	PERSON	in the chair of biology at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, is the author of what is by far the best popular account of Mendelism yet published .

		This book went through two large editions , and was then taken over by another publisher , and the present enlarged and rewritten third edition has been issued .

		It is a model of popular scientific writing , recalling Huxley at his best .

		Without going into unneces - sary technical detail , it traces the progress of dis - covery in this field from
Mendel	PERSON	's work to the pres - ent day .

		The author has himself largely contri - buted to this advance in the series of `` Reports to the
Evolution Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which the investigations of
Bateson	PERSON	and his co - workers at
Cambridge	LOCATION	have been recorded .

		Another master of popular scientific writing has well charac - terized
Punnett	PERSON	's book as `` an unsurpassed exposi - tion by an expert investigator . ''

		Taken together , the books on Evolution here reviewed give a most gratifying impression of the vigor and healthf ulness of present-day biology .

		Five out of the list record fundamental advances in human knowledge and in the ability of man to con - trol the forces of nature .

		It is not too much to say that the phenomena of mutation and Mendelian inheritance have almost , if not quite , as deep signi - ficance for the science of biology as has the idea of Evolution itself .

		But substantially the whole body of our present knowledge about these matters has been gained during little more than a decade past .

		Surely a science which can show a record like this is neither `` moribund '' nor `` bankrupt , '' nor in immediate danger of entering upon either of these states .

		Everyone admits that it is the most difficult of matters justly to appraise the real value of pres - ent achievements .

		Yet he is surely mistaken who assumes that they are on the average greatly inferior to those of the past that biology has made no great or fundamental advances since
Darwin	PERSON	, or physics since
Newton	ORGANIZATION	or Clerk-Maxwell .

		The '' golden ages of science '' are by no means all gone by .

		In point of fact , '' good old days '' are hardy perennials .

		We may be sure that one , two , or three generations hence there will be plenty to say of this good day and age , '' Ah , but there really were giants then ! ''

		These studies are the out - growth of a series of lectures delivered at several universities .

		The sub-title of the book '' From Radicalism to Conservative Revolt '' furnishes an index to the writer 's point of view and a key to the historical philosophy of the work .

		The three leaders are fitly chosen as exponents of Southern opinion , one being a great leveller , and the others claiming to be his followers but with a difference .

		They came of plain Western people , and were not aristocrats
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 born and bred , as some would have us believe all Southern leaders were .

		Professor
Dodd	PERSON	suggests many new points of view and re-states old known facts in a fresh way .

		He traces dominant Southern opinion from the radical national democracy of the late eighteenth and the
early nineteenth century	DATE	through its slow development to conservative sec - tionalism and secession .

		He gives us an unusually effective background , historical , political , economic , social , and religious , which is necessary to a proper understanding of the careers of these leaders ; and in several instances he makes skilful use of formerly neglected episodes , such as the personal disagree - ment between
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, and the social war on Mrs.
Eaton	PERSON	.

		The proper value is assigned to the work of the early Southern leaders in nation-building .

		The best of the studies is that on
Calhoun	PERSON	; the treatment of Nullification and of
Calhoun	PERSON	's later years being particularly good .

		It is perhaps too much to expect minute accuracy in a brief interpretation of Southern history , but there are some points on which it seems that Professor
Dodd	PERSON	might have done better .

		For example , it is hardly correct to say that
Jefferson	PERSON	was a leader of a nation of '' peasant farmers , '' for not only has there never been anything like a peasant class of white people in
America	LOCATION	, but the peasant tempera - ment could never have long existed in any part of
America	LOCATION	, certainly not in the South .

		It would seem , too , that undue importance is attached to the failure of
Virginia	LOCATION	to emancipate her slaves in
1831	DATE	.

		A student of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	history can hardly find warrant for saying that such emancipation would have pre - vented the Civil War , for the social and economic organization of the
Gulf States	LOCATION	was already crystal - lizing into definite form , which the action of
Virginia	LOCATION	would not have affected seriously .

		The
Davis	PERSON	family was not '' hardshell '' Baptist ; there is almost as much difference between the '' hardshell ''
Bap	ORGANIZATION	- tists and the regular Baptists as there is between Methodists and Catholics .


Jefferson Davis	PERSON	did not make a `` clandestine '' marriage , nor was he a brigadier general in the Mexican War .

		Finally , the great subject of controversy , slavery , is treated almost entirely in its political and economic aspects , to the neglect of the social aspect .

		Of course as an economic interest the influence of slavery was great ; but it was slavery as a social problem that drove the people of the South to distraction during the abolition agitation , and more and more as the Civil War drew near was the slavery question one of social psychology , of race feeling .

		It was this aspect of slavery , not the property aspect , that welded the Southern people together in resistance to what they believed to be Northern aggression .

		In these days when
Europe	LOCATION	is over - y with tourists , and every inch of it seems to be accessible by a Cook 's ticket , it is a surprise as well as pleasure to be intro - duced to a city comparatively unknown and highly interesting , situated in the heel of
Italy	LOCATION	's boot .

		The name of this city is
Lecce	LOCATION	; it lies only twenty-four miles southeast of
Brindisi	LOCATION	; it is of ancient origin , but presents as its primary and distinctive interest the most representative and picturesque collection of baroque buildings to be found in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		A book by Mr.
Martin Shaw Briggs	PERSON	, called '' In the Heel of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , is the first attempt ever made in any language to outline the city 's history and to describe its inhabitants , their interesting province , and their remarkable achievements in art .

		Far below the streets of modern
Lecce	LOCATION	are layers of Greek and Roman remains ; more than once in the Dark Ages the city was almost wiped out ; in mediaeval times there were the usual incidents of warfare and bloodshed , varied by an occasional plague , up to
1456	DATE	, when a terrible earthquake cost the .

		lives of most of the citizens and left only one church standing .

		This varied history occupies the first half of the volume ; but the individual interest of
Lecce	LOCATION	, that which makes it different from other Italian cities and so well worthy of a visit , does not begin until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , when a brilliant architectural period came into being .

		The older remains , interesting as they are , interfere but little with the general effect of
Lecce	LOCATION	as a baroque city , surrounded by mediaeval walls and gates .

		This word '' baroque , '' as a technical term among architects , conveys a meaning of over - elaboration , of ornament misapplied , proportion disregarded , and detail used regardless of structural functions .

		It is an unpopular style , but for a style of architecture to be unpopular is no hall-mark of inferiority .

		Abolish the baroque at
Venice	LOCATION	, and we should lose the Church of the Salute ; at
Genoa	LOCATION	, many of the magnificent staircases and courtyards ; at
Florence	LOCATION	,
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	's little chapel of loveli - ness ; at
Rome	LOCATION	, half the fountains , terraces , and open spaces , most of the palaces and churches ; and there would remain a mere museum of broken columns and oddments of buildings , with only an occasional mediaeval church or modern shop to vary its monotony .

		As an almost unaltered example of a baroque city ,
Lecce	LOCATION	occupies a unique position ; hence this architectural study of it is one of extreme interest and value .

		The architect-author 's drawings -LRB- forty-three in number -RRB- , his plan of the city and map of the region , the appendices , bibliography , and index , are remarkably scholarly and illuminative of the text .

		Even those travellers who think they have known

		A father-in-law -LRB- the late King George -RRB- of fiendish malignity and diabolical cruelty , aided by a minister of lago-like cunning and skill in besmirch - ing a woman 's fair fame , at last succeeded in driving the sorely-distracted princess to that step which , in the construction put upon it by her enemies , made her return to
Dresden	LOCATION	impossible , except as the head of a revolutionary faction which she wisely refused to recognize .

		Such , in brief , is the story she tells of her wrongs , and it bears the imprint of sincerity .

		Elaborated with the literary art she possesses with - out ever having studied it , the narrative makes remarkably interesting reading , and at the same time dispels for the nonce the glamour surrounding royal and imperial personages .

William	PERSON	and prophet .

		the Silent , '' in two volumes , in which she pictured '' the moderate man of the sixteenth century '' chiefly from his own letters and those of his enemies , there is room for the new volume from the Putnam press , wholly rewritten as it is , even as there is yet room for further biographies of a mighty man whose personality can not be satisfactorily under - stood by any one person .

		This we say , even though the German
Felix Rachfahl	PERSON	finished the second vol - ume and sixteen hundredth page of his work on
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	in
1906	DATE	, with the most important part of
William	LOCATION	's life yet to treat .

		Motley intro - duced this man of the ages to the English-speaking world , but he took the perspective and was compassed with the infirmities and limitations of his time .

		Miss Putnam , whose scholarly and conscientious qualifica - tions are evidenced in her previous works , sets him forth as her acquaintance with the archivists of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	has enabled her to do .

		Yet who can be satisfied for a moment with either this or any other sketch thus far made of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, when he seeks to inquire critically as to how far
William	PERSON	, the organizer of the common people , saw into the twentieth-century world of popular move - ment ?

		What sincere Catholic or inquiring Protest - ant can be satisfied with
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	's treatment of this Catholic-Lutheran-Calvinist as a religious man ?

		With profound contempt of religion-mongers and manipulating ecclesiastics , the founder of the Dutch Republic was probably as true a Christian as ever stood on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Especially clear and valuable in
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	's book are the accounts of
William	LOCATION	's four marriages , and of the traits and temperaments of the women to whom he committed his happiness .

		With equal clearness and admirable detail of truth , she has pictured for us the women rulers of the
Netherlands	LOCATION	; and here her touch is masterly .

		Nevertheless , with all admiration of the writer 's work , one suspects she has been over - whelmed by the mass of detail and has hardly solved the seeming puzzle of the character of
William	LOCATION	.

		We are far from saying that this is not to her credit , for Miss Putnam never goes beyond the authority of '' the written word . ''

		She knows , as well as
Fruin	PERSON	or
Blok	ORGANIZATION	, that the popular phrase '' the Silent '' as applied to
William	PERSON	is even less historical than was '' Mad
Anthony	PERSON	, '' '' Old Hickory , '' or other absurd and confusing popular epithets applied to prominent characters in
America	LOCATION	.

		The story of what Roman Catholics called `` The Troubles , '' and Protestants '' The Glorious Struggle for Freedom , '' is told with scholarly power , and with a regard for illuminating details that remind one of

		Why do they have boar 's head for dinner on Christmas day at

		These and many other questions that are likely to pop into the head of an intelligent visitor at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	are an - swered by Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	, himself sometime scholar of
Exeter	LOCATION	, in his handy volume , `` The Romance of the Oxford Colleges '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which , with its seventeen handsome plates from photographs , and its separate chapter for each of the twenty-one colleges of the university , forms an excellent supplement to last year 's more inclusive work on '' Oxford and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, '' from various pens and strikingly illustrated by Mr.
Hanslip Fletcher	PERSON	.

		The book-burning incident alluded to above , so strange a ceremony for its time and place , may be related here in a few words .

		It was the Rev.
William Sewell	PERSON	,
Froude	PERSON	's colleague at
Exeter	LOCATION	, and accustomed in his lectures to make Aristotle 's '' Ethics '' or
Virgil	PERSON	's '' Georgics '' an excuse for delivering his opinions on matters of more modern and local interest , who took occasion to denounce
Froude	PERSON	's '' Nemesis '' and to inquire whether anyone in his audience was the possessor of a copy of the book .

		One such owner revealed himself . ''

		Then bring it here , sir ! ''

		thundered the lecturer . ''

		It was brought , '' says Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	, '' and
Sewell	PERSON	stripped off the binding , tore the pages across , pitched the mutilated volume into the flames , and stood over it , thrusting at it with the poker until it was burnt to ashes . ''

		Such was the memorable occurrence , on
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 301 the authority of an eye-witness ; and many other hardly less curious incidents , not always so well authenticated , however , give vivacity to the pages of this practised narrator of interesting things .

		A few more pictures -LRB- four of the colleges , including Pem - broke and Jesus , having none -RRB- would not have come amiss ; nor would an index to the book 's treasures have been superfluous .

		The habit of reading , which
Gibbon	PERSON	declared he `` would not exchange for the wealth of the Indies , '' has become so inveterate with Mr.
George Hamlin Fitch	PERSON	, endeared to all readers of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	'' Chronicle , '' as to make him an excellent authority on such a subject as '' Comfort Found in Good Old Books '' the title to a collection of literary talks contributed to the above-named newspaper and now issued in tasteful book form by
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		The little volume is prefaced with a touching account of the sad occurrence that evoked it .

		The sudden death of an only and much-loved son sent the grief-stricken father to his tried and trusty old authors for consolation ; and being asked by friends and correspondents to name these authors and indicate the peculiar excellences to be found in each , he has done so .

		Considerably less space than Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's five feet of shelving would hold the liter - ary masterpieces he descants upon , and thus it is well within the power of everyone to whom the chapters are addressed to test for himself the comforting and cheering quality of these good old books .

		Few though the books themselves are , the wide range of Mr.
Fitch	PERSON	's sympathies and tastes , and of his son 's also , may be judged from his rather surprising asser - tion that '' we enjoyed with equal relish
Mascagni	LOCATION	's ' Cavalleria , ' led by the composer himself , or a championship prize-fight ;
Margaret Anglin	PERSON	's sombre but appealing Antigone or a funny ' stunt ' at the Orpheum . ''

		The Bible , naturally enough , comes first in his book-list , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	next .

		Of the latter he says , '' Our knowledge of Shakespeare is terribly meagre , '' whereas , to our thinking , this meagreness of authenticated biographical detail is rather a cause for satisfaction than for terror or even regret , his works serving as the incomparable mirror of his mind and heart .

		Well-selected portraits , facsimile title-pages , and other appropriate illustra - tions adorn these well-considered chapters of a true book-lover .

		The experimental study of animal behavior is a new and very vital branch of scientific investigation .

		Its youth and vigor is indicated by the fact that a series of studies issued a dozen years ago now finds a more permanent record in connection with later papers , and that some apology is necessary for the less advanced and rigorous methods of the earlier work .

		Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	's investigations on '' Animal Intelligence '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are well worthy of reprinting .

		The volume forms a contribution of the first importance to the study of the animal mind .

		Studies of behavior in animals .

		The general conclusions of the study favor a consid - erable complexity of mental process , but not quite the complexity that the human mind is apt to read into animal behavior .

		The point is well illustrated by the psychology of imitation .

		The off-hand ob - server is quite convinced that all the higher animals imitate both one another and human patterns , and popular language has made the word '' ape '' a syn - onym for this trait .

		Science seems to discover in this assumption either a vague tradition or a jump at a conclusion ; for cases of genuine imitation are at least rare even in so intelligent a creature as the monkey .

		The facts of animal behavior , the stimuli to which the animal really responds , and the play of thought and motives which really induce the response , are difficult to determine .

		Reasoning backward from the bare evidence of observable con - duct to the process by which the result was accom - plished is still more uncertain ; and here appear the pitfalls set for human reason , lay and expert alike .

		A perusal of Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	's book will in - form the reader as to the delicacy of the thought - processes both of the animal mind and the human mind in interpreting the procedure of the former .

		In addition , the work illustrates admirably the methods of comparative psychology equally applica - ble to man and the higher animals .

		... , .

		The various aids to the learning of the student of psychology naturally make slight psvchoiogv .

		appeal to the general public , how - ever important to the student and the teacher .

		Textbooks in psychology have not yet reached that settled stage in which traditions are fixed , and re - finements of method and elaborations of detail are alone significant .

		Fundamental principles , both of theory and of presentation , are still in the tentative stage , and as a consequence a considerable variety of divergent texts are now in use .

		To these a further contribution is made by Prof.
Robert M. Yerkes	PERSON	-LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Professor Yerkes has made a read - able and in some ways an original book .

		Those teachers of psychology who believe in the emphasis of analysis and yet accompany this with a large range of concrete observations , both experimental and occasional , and who further agree with the perspective of value which Professor Yerkes assigns to the several main topics , will find his text accept - able and helpful .

		This comment does not dismiss the work with faint praise , but merely calls attention to the limited general interest of the book , as well as its limited availability , unless one is at the outset committed to this mode of approach to a complex subject .

		Doubtless the book will find its way to classes and to instructors sympathetic with Professor
Yerkes	PERSON	's perspective of the mental life .

		None the less , a general fault is manifest in the first hundred pages , which confuse the student by instructing him in far too great detail in regard to the intentions of the teacher and the methods to which the student will be subjected .

		In the hands of a judicious teacher , the book will prove serviceable .

		302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, NOTES .

		It is reported that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has recently fin - ished work on a '' historical fairy-play , '' which will be produced in
London	LOCATION	some time next year .

		Miss

		It has been announced that '' The Journal of a Recluse , '' which attracted considerable attention upon its anonymous publication a year or two ago , is the work of Miss
Mary Fisher	PERSON	, a
St. Louis	LOCATION	writer . ''

		The Eleventh Hour in the Life of
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	'' is the title of a book of intimate recollections of her mother that Mrs.
Maud Howe	PERSON	has prepared for publication this month by
Messrs. Little Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The only new novel written by Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	since the publication of '' The Broad Highway , '' will be published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in
1912	DATE	, after it has appeared serially in ''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		It will be called '' The Amateur Gentleman . ''

		`` Beethoven , '' by Mr.
H. A. Rudell	PERSON	; ''
Purcell	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
W. H. Cummings	PERSON	; `` Mozart , '' by Dr.
F. Gehring	PERSON	; and '' English Church Composers , '' by Mr.
W. A. Barrett	PERSON	, are new editions of works published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	in their '' Great Musicians '' series .

		A `` Centennial Edition '' of
Forster 's Life of Dickens	ORGANIZATION	, issued in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's birth , is announced for publication this month by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Five hundred illustrations of persons and places connected with
Dickens	PERSON	will form a special feature . ''

		The Dutch Republic and the American Revolution '' is a
John Hopkins	PERSON	monograph by Dr.
Friedrich Edler	PERSON	, which traces an influence '' mostly clandestine , or indi - rect , '' but '' nevertheless remarkably effective '' upon the course of affairs in the American colonies during the War of Independence .


Henri Bergson	PERSON	's study of '' Laughter '' is to be pub - lished soon by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sub-title of the book , '' An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic , '' gives a good idea of its character .

		The English translation was made with the author 's permission by Messrs.
Cloudesley Brereton	PERSON	and
Fred Rothwell	PERSON	.

		Still another anthology of verse for children is under way for early publication .

		The compiler in this instance is Miss
Jeanette Gilder	PERSON	, and her book -LRB- to be published by the
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be entitled '' The Heart of Youth . ''

		Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett	PERSON	contributes an introduction to the volume .

		Mrs.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	is preparing a memoir of her late husband , and asks the loan of letters written by him to friends and acquaintances .

		These letters will be promptly and carefully returned , intact .

		Any characteristic anecdotes or reminiscences of Colonel

		Mrs.

Buckingham St.	LOCATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		The publishers of Mr.
George Fitch	PERSON	's volume of humorous college stories , '' At Good Old Siwash , '' are offering
$ 50	MONEY	.

		in prizes for the best brief opinions of the book .

		Undergraduates and graduates of all colleges are invited to participate .

		Information regarding the contest may be obtained from
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Few books have made their appearance so precisely at the '' psychologic moment '' as
Demetra Vaka	PERSON	's '' In the Shadow of Islam , '' just published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As readers of her '' Haremlik '' know , she has an unique knowledge of the intimacies of Turkish life , and her new novel is said to throw much light upon the present situation in
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		The '' timely '' note in fiction is often struck , and struck effectively , by novelists who strive for immediate popular success .

		Such timeliness , whether designed or accidental , conspicuously marks
M. Paul Adam	PERSON	's new novel , '' La Ville Inconnue , '' which presents a supposed episode in the European conquest of
Africa	LOCATION	out of which has arisen the present Moroccan difficulty .

		The beginnings of
Lapland	LOCATION	literature for literature in
Lapland	LOCATION	seems hitherto to have held much the same place as that occupied by snakes in
Ireland	LOCATION	are to be hailed in a book said to have been written by a veritable Laplander , one
Johan Olafson Turi	PERSON	, a hunter who cheers the solitude of his long and arduous hunting expeditions in winter by composing poems and sketches descriptive -LRB- we infer -RRB- of his hyperborean experiences .

		One can not but hope that he will find a publisher , if he has not already done so , for these first-fruits of his pen , since they must be rather out of the ordinary .

		An English translation is awaited with interest . ''

		A Concordance to the Poems of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' soon to be issued in this country by Messrs.
E. P. Dut	PERSON	- ton
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will be the second volume published under the auspices of the
American Concordance Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		It represents several years of devoted industry on the part of Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	, of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The magnitude of the work and the amount of labor entailed by it may be realized when it is known that it requires a quarto volume of 113G double-columned pages to embody the results .

		The Concordance is based on Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	's `` Oxford '' edition of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, but also includes variations , anomalous passages , and poems from private or divergent sources such as '' The Letters of the
Wordsworth	PERSON	Family , '' and the Newell-Smith and the '' Eversley '' editions of
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		The
October	DATE	number of '' The Yale Review '' begins a new series and initiates a new career for that publi - cation .

		Under the management of a trust association of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	graduates , the Review will hereafter be pub - lished as a general quarterly modelled on the admirable publications of that class in
England	LOCATION	.

		Such a publica - tion , contemporary in its interests , authoritative in its presentations , and devoted to serious criticism of life and letters , will be almost alone in the field in this country , and there is every reason to hope that it will succeed .

		The first number of this new series argues at least that it deserves success .

		A study of war from the vigorous and trenchant pen of the late Professor Sumner , articles on
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Fogazzaro	PERSON	, a study of present dramatic conditions and tendencies by Profes -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 303 sor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	, two poems of decided merit , and an admirable book review department , are the prominent features of the number .

		Huth books for the British Museum have been selected from the
Huth	PERSON	collection , in accordance with the terms of the will , and embrace a goodly number of the rarest treasures in early printed works , which would probably bring as much as a quarter of a
million dollars	MONEY	if offered for sale with the rest of the famous library .

		Among the items chosen by the Museum authorities are to be noted such rarities as
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's '' Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers '' -LRB- 1477 -RRB- , `` The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and
Juliet	PERSON	, written first in Italian by
Bandell	LOCATION	, and nowe in English by Ar .

		Br . ''

		-LRB- 1562 -RRB- ,
Daye	PERSON	's '' Daphnis and Chloe '' -LRB- 1587 -RRB- , and the exceedingly rare Shakespearean quarto , '' Richard the Second , '' in its first and anonymous edition of
1597	DATE	.

		Only one other copy of this last is known to exist , in the
Capell	LOCATION	collection at
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The mere list -LRB- it is of some length -RRB- of these treasures now acquired by the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	is enough to drive a bibliophile frantic with desire .

		A number of contributions , scientific and inspirational , to the study of Jesus are announced for early publica - tion by the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the '' Theological Translation Library '' there will appear '' Christ : The Beginning of Dogma , '' an historical dis - cussion of the rise of what was the first dogma in the primitive church , by Dr.

Johannes	PERSON	-LRB- Or , The Quest -RRB- By
FREDERICK VAN EEDEN	PERSON	Translated from the Dutch by CLARA BELL With an Introductory Essay by
ANDREW LANG	PERSON	/ lpHIS work was published in an - * - American translation several years ago under the title of '' The Quest , '' but has long been out of print .

		It is , on the surface , a fairy tale , told with an extraordinarily sympathetic insight into the life of nature , a sensitive eye for nature 's beauty , and a gift of expression that has been fully preserved in the translation .

		But this fairy tale is written by a man who not only loves nature and children , but who is a serious student of human life in its graver and perplexing aspects , and the sub-title of the original work , '' An Allegory of a Poet 's Soul , '' conveyed an intimation of a serious under-current in the book an intima - tion that the reader will find amply ful - filled .

		The present edition is printed and bound in an unusually attractive way , forming a charming gift book .

		THE DIAL 319 Among Neale 's Fall Books of Literature Mr.
Carl Holliday	PERSON	's THE CAVALIER POETS Every lover of English literature long has felt the want of an adequate treatment of the `` metaphysical '' movement that began soon after the time of Spenser and Shakes - peare , survived the coldly classical day of
Dryden	PERSON	and Pope , and finally culminated in the passionate outbursts of
Burns	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		But not until now could be had in a single volume a comprehensive anthology and study of that famous group of poets , known by various names , Metaphysical , Cavalier , Rhetorical , Fantastic , and
Caroline Poets	PERSON	, that wrote so delicately and with so great charm during Cavalier days , and whose influence on the poetry of our time is so marked .

		In this elaborate anthol - ogy and study , Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	, Acting Head of the Depart - ment of English Literature ,
Vanderbilt University	ORGANIZATION	, not only tells of the brave deeds of these
Cavaliers	ORGANIZATION	, their love affairs , and of their poetic ideals , but he also tells of the gay life of the day , of the customs , and of the scenes in rural
England	LOCATION	and in boisterous
London	LOCATION	of the
early seventeenth century	DATE	.

		The biographical sketches of the more important Cavaliers are delightfully entertaining , sympathetic , and instructive .

		Such old favorites as , `` I could not love thee , dear , so much , Loved I not honour more '' and `` Why so pale and wan fond lover ? ''

		come to us with renewed charm because of the insight that this book gives into the life of brave , chivalrous , broken - hearted
Lovelace	PERSON	, of that wild profligate , but lovable and brilliant , Suckling , and of genial
Herrick	PERSON	, `` the hearty country parson , drinking the wine of life deeply and gladly , '' in the glowing fields of Devonshire or in
London	LOCATION	.

		Whether telling of Dr.
John Donne	PERSON	, the founder of the movement , or of pious , romantic
George Herbert	PERSON	, or of
Tom Carew	PERSON	, gallant , gracious , insouciant , little knowing and caring less that his poems were the connecting link between
Jonson	PERSON	and Prior or `` of the saintly priest and enraptured singer '' Crashaw , Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	enters into the life and work of each in a way that fascinates as well as informs .

		For the author 's style , although critical , fulfils his purpose , as announced in his preface : `` It is my hope that the sweetness , the daintiness , the chivalry , the artis - tic temperament of this spirit may be transmitted in some degree to the readers of this volume ... '' If you do not know these poets
Herrick	PERSON	,
Quarles	PERSON	,
Herbert	PERSON	,
Carew	PERSON	,
Lovelace	PERSON	,
Cowley	PERSON	,

		Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	: `` Wherever we find Bierce we feel the working of a daring intelligence , of an original mind ; and we feel this even when we dissent from his striding and crushing opinions ... His is a com - posite mind a blending of

		Mr.

London	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` There are stories of
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's that I shall never for - get ; there are stories in
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	's ` In the Midst of Life ' that I shall remember while memory lasts . ''

		Vanity Fair -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` Mr.
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	is in the front rank of American critics , if indeed he does not head them all .

		English critics have something to learn from him ... Satirist , poet , soldier , literary artist in a dozen phases Bierce appeals to the discriminating reader . ''

		The Israelite -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` He is so great a master of English that it is difficult to place him , or to make com - parisons .

		He knows English .

		He knows its power and is able to draw out that power and to handle it , gently , delicately ; playing it into indefinite iris colors ; letting it shimmer and tremble in soul-touching pathos , or giving it its full potentiality in a swing , so crisp and clean-cut , so pliant and strong , so rare and magnificent that it pene - trates the mind like a volatile spirit . ''

		THE POEMS OF
FRANCIS ORRAY	PERSON	TICKNOR At last the complete works of this notable Southern poet are published in a style that is wholly adequate ; at last he takes his place among his compeers of the South on the library shelves , as long ago he took his place by their side in the hearts of thousands of lovers of poetry .

		This definitive edition is the work of the poet 's grand - daughter , Miss
Michelle Cutliff Ticknor	PERSON	, and is the result of many years of study and research .

		In the volume is included a biographical sketch of Ticknor by Miss Tick - nor , a critical appreciation of the poet by
Paul Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	, and a bibliography of the works pertaining to the poet .

		In his `` Representative Southern Poets , ''
Hubner	PERSON	writes of
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's martial poems , declaring that in them Mr.

		the poet 's genius `` exhibits itself in its most impressive flights . ''

		He goes on to say : `` In the power of passion - ate feeling , in terse , concentrated diction , clear , ringing music , and idealistic imagery , the poetry evolved by the incidents , the pathos , the glory and the gloom of our civil war shows but few examples that can be considered superior to the best of
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's contributions to that phase of our American literature . ''


James Maurice Thompson	PERSON	once wrote : `` With Ticknor , as with
Beranger	PERSON	, strength Is simplicity , art is naturalness . ''

		ABROAD All that have read Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's fine book of criticism that we published a year ago , `` Their Day in Court : The Case of
American Letters	ORGANIZATION	and Its Causes , '' will eagerly seek this volume , which does not pander so much to the needs of travellers as to their sense of humor .

		Its most ironic passages are made at the typical Anglo-Saxon tour - ist .

		We all like fun made of our neighbors ; it is not in human nature to feel that we ourselves are satirized : no one makes fun of us .

		Yet for individual ironic comment on our own people you will search long in our current literature of travel .

		The book does not profess to inform .

		It does not direct us how to get there , what luggage to take : nor instruct us as to what must be seen , what avoided .

		All such general orders , thinks Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	, surely affect only those that admit themselves without identity of their own the members of the rabble .

		This book is addressed to individuals .

		It is the whimsical record of an individual 's adventures along the primrose path of entertainment .

		The book 's range of comparisons , between
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, will give the student of our central mod - ern civilization plenty of food for thought .

		Sophisticated travellers will , it is believed , be continually amused by these passages .

		Innocents abroad , if resentful at first of an apparent unconcern for their welfare , will find , as they close the book , that they have unconsciously absorbed knowledge , and that they have begun to emerge from provincials into citizens of the world .

		TRANSLATOR 'S PREFACE RIGNANO is a student of Biology who has also the training of an engineer and physicist .

		He has studied biological problems tboroughout from that standpoint .

		He offers in this book an explanation on a physical basis of assimilation , growth , cell division and differentiation , ontogeny , and the biogenetic law of recapitulation , and he suggests a mechanism whereby the inheritance of acquired characters may be effected .

		Such a study of the most fundamental and difficult of biological problems can not fail to be of the greatest interest to all students of science .

		To discover the essential nature of living matter , Biology needs the help of Physics and
Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	.

		BASIL HARVEY . ''

		Some deny flatly the possibility of ever arriving at an understanding of the nature of life .

		But if we ask ourselves in what this understanding of the nature of life could consist , from the point of view of positive philosophy , we have no difficulty in recognizing that such an understanding must be reduced to comparing vital phenomena with some physico-chemical model already known , suitably modified by the particular special conditions imposed upon it so that just these special conditions shall determine the differences which exist between this vital phenomenon and the phenomenon of the inorganic world most closely related to it .

		If this be so , it is then the duty of science emphatically to reject such a denial of scientific thought as would be constituted by the renunciation of the quest of this understanding .

		Whether one clearly recognizes it or not , it is just this search for the nature of the vital principle which properly constitutes the principal object and the final goal of all biologic study in general . ''

		350 RELIGION IN EDUCATION .

		One does not look to judicial pronouncements for '' good reading '' in the literary sense .

		The decisions of the courts are usually couched in technical language , and employ a traditional jargon which , whatever the force of its logic , is not characterized by that power to charm which we naturally demand of any writing that is to claim our attention as literature .

		But if we are willing to dispense with charm upon occasion , and be content with force and cogency , we may sometimes derive a considerable degree of satis - faction from the final statement of judicial authority upon a controverted question , par - ticularly if that question concerns some matter of deep and vital interest .

		The place of religion in public education undoubtedly offers a ques - tion of this sort , and those who take it to heart will do well to examine the recent decision of
the Supreme Court of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	which puts an end to religious exercises in the public schools of the commonwealth .

		This decision is a docu - ment of much weight and lucidity , and supports the position taken by the court with an argu - ment which is essentially unanswerable .

		The pleas which have been urged against it , whether by the dissenting justices or by the zealots of the pulpit , are either shuffling evasions of the point at issue or appeals to the decisions made by weaker or more compromising benches in other
States	LOCATION	.

		In the petition upon which this decision was made , the relators , being members of the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, averred that their children were forced by law to attend the public schools , and that while thus in attendance they were daily obliged to participate in exercises which included the reading of an unacceptable version of the Scriptures , the reciting in concert of a prayer not sanctioned by their church , and the singing of hymns repugnant to their faith .

		Furthermore , these children , while engaged in these exercises , were required to assume a devo - tional attitude in expression of their acquies - cence .

		It was claimed that these several com - pulsions , taken collectively , amounted to a viola - tion of their constitutional right of religious freedom .

		The fundamental law of
Illinois	LOCATION	guarantees `` the free exercise and enjoyment of religious freedom and worship , without dis - 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, crimination , '' and the Court delivered its judg - ment in the following language : '' The exercises mentioned in the petition constitute worship .

		They are the ordinary forms of worship usually practised by Protestant Christian denominations .

		Their compulsory performance would be a violation of the constitutional guaranty of the free exercise and enjoy - ment of religious profession and worship .

		One does not enjoy the free exercise of religious worship who is com - pelled to join in any form of religious worship .

		... If the petitioners ' children are required to join in the acts of worship , as alleged in the petition , against their con - sent and against the wishes of their parents , they are deprived of the freedom of religious worship guaranteed to them by the Constitution ... The free enjoyment of religious worship includes the freedom not to worship . ''

		This is the gist of the argument , which is , of course , supported by an elaborate array of cited cases and historical facts .

		It places the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	upon firm ground , and definitely elimin - ates religion from our politics .

		All the pulling and hauling , all the `` playing for position '' that must accompany attempts to make the civil gov - ernment the sponsor for religious observances , are made impossible by this simple declaration that religion is a matter of strictly private con - cern .

		It should be welcome to every serious person , not actuated by a sectarian motive , and having the real interests of religion at heart .

		We say all this because history clearly shows that a complete severance of Church from
State	ORGANIZATION	is the only solution of the problem that can have the stamp of finality .

		The century-long struggle of
France	LOCATION	over the Concordat , the half - OO century-long struggle of
Italy	LOCATION	over the temporal claims of the papacy , and the miserable squab - bling over religious teaching at the public charge which still does so much to debase the political life of
England	LOCATION	, are examples that should be found sufficiently instructive were it not for the proverbial fact that there are none so blind as those who will not see .

		To sweep all religious controversies out of politics for good , should be the declared object of those who really believe that the principle of religious freedom is one of the foundation-stones of our government .

		It was an American commonwealth that as early as
1649	DATE	enacted the first written law of tolera - tion in the English-speaking world , and it should be one of the noblest purposes of the American nation to carry out to its logical conclusion the movement thus inaugurated two and a half cen - turies ago .

		It is not without regret that we acquiesce in this principle when its religious application in - volves , as in the case of the
Illinois	LOCATION	decision , the exclusion of the Bible from the public schools .

		We regard a familiar acquaintance with the
Bible	LOCATION	as one of the most important elements of any education , both because the Authorized Version is incomparably the greatest prose treas - ure of English literature , and because it is a key to the understanding of what is best in the English literature of three subsequent centuries .

		Whatever is possible to be done to further an ac - quaintance with this great Book has our heartiest approval and support , provided only that it be not done at the cost of coercion of minorities in a matter with which majorities , however large , are not rightfully concerned . ''

		It is precisely for the protection of the minority that constitu - tional limitations exist , '' says our decision ; and no greater danger at present confronts our civ - ilization that is found in the weakening hold of this vital truth upon men 's minds .

		The alarm sounded by
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, a generation ago , and by Mill long before that , has been justified many times during the years that have since elapsed .

		It would be simply impossible , with - out - maintaining an open sore in the body politic , to permit the Bible to be used in the public schools , because most of those who as instructors were using it would , some unconsciously , but more of sly and set purpose , make it the vehicle of teachings that could not fail to irritate their hearers and create dissensions among them .

		In fact , those who are loudest in demanding that the Bible be forced upon unwilling listeners would be the first to protest if it were treated strictly as a work of literary and ethical excel - lence , with no suggestion of a sanctity setting it apart from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		This is by no means their game , and their under - lying purpose is one that the
State	ORGANIZATION	has no right to countenance .

		If we are to have a religious element in our public education , it must be conceived upon lines that have no relation to any scriptures , however sacred to some , or to any form of theo - logical doctrine .

		What is both permissible and desirable is outlined by President
Eliot	PERSON	, in a recent terse and closely-reasoned magazine article .

		It is a religion that is '' a frame of mind , or a state of feeling , possible to men and women of any church or any sect . ''

		It is a re - ligion without supernatural implications , based solely upon the everlasting ideals of goodness , beauty , and truth .

		It is a religion that will be imparted unconsciously by every lesson in history , literature , or science .

		It is a religion that will be intimately bound up with the dis - cipline and social life of the school , and that will be known by its fruits of gentleness , and helpfulness , and consideration of the rights of
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 others , and acquiescence in the paramount claims of the general good over the individual desire .

		This may not be what the narrow-minded call religion , but it is the precious precipitate of all the turbid solutions of all the creeds .

		THACKERAY AND DICKENS A CON - TRAST AND COMPARISON .

		A complete assay of any great author , a quantita - tive and qualitative analysis , is an elaborate process ; and the materials and implements used ought to be free from imperfections .

		A subjective alloy falsifies the result , though it may be interesting as a revela - tion of the critic himself .

		The public at large jumps at its conclusion , generally by the way of compar - ison .

		This man differs from this other in such or such a way .

		When writers come in pairs , the task of taste is simplified .

		Goethe 's remark that the German public ought to be glad that it had two such fine fellows as
Schiller	PERSON	and himself without setting them up against each other , is just enough , but the instinct of the world to balance them is inevitable .

		And so with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		For a brief deter - minationof qualities , criticism at a glimpse , there is no better method than such comparison .

		If there were any absolute standard , all talents could be referred to that ; but as there is no literary yard - measure deposited in any Government office , it is an interesting process to get two men who repre - sent contrasted and complementary qualities in art and coax them to reveal each other 's merits and defects .

		It seems to me that there is one great and over - whelming distinction between the art of
Thackeray	PERSON	and that of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		The art of the former is almost purely intellectual ; that of the latter is physically based is preeminently sensuous .

		Sensuousness is the poet 's gift .

		It takes account of the sights , sounds , scents of nature ; of the forms , faces , ges - tures , all the visible charactery of humanity , and it relates all these things together , arriving not only at objective presentation but at almost the same kind of tone as the related values of great pictures can achieve .

		Thackeray is of course not utterly without this gift , few writers are .

		But with
Dickens	PERSON	, light and darkness , the aspects of nature , the look of town or village streets , the personalities of old inns and houses , the physical characteristics of his people , are the very warp of his work .

		He really painted us an
England	LOCATION	of his own .

		Far too often , indeed , in dealing with men and women , he is obsessed by his corporeal imagination , and his creations almost dis - appear behind their physical signature .

		Carker 's teeth ,
Quilp	PERSON	's deformity , the dwarfishness of the Dolls ' Dressmaker , are too much in evidence .

		Thackeray 's method is that of high comedy pure dialogue with only the accessory of his own choric moralizing .

		Scene , costume , personal appearance , must be largely supposed .

		This is the difference between epic and dramatic art .

		Either may result in vital and visualized crea - tions .

		But in the case of the dramatis personce of the two authors in question , it seems indubitable that those of
Dickens	PERSON	are more vividly realized than those of his rival .

		Certainly they have made more impression on the world .

		The two Wellers ,
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	and the Marchioness ,
Sairy Gamp	PERSON	,
Peck	PERSON	- sniff ,
Micawber	PERSON	, and a score of others , belong in the roll of the world 's great comic creations , where it would be futile to say that any of
Thackeray	PERSON	's people can be found .

		Is this because they are more original and eccentric ?

		It can not be because they are truer to actual life .

		Thackeray 's reasoned-out characters are much nearer to the fact in humanity .

		They change , grow , develop , and seldom exceed probability .

		Dickens 's beings are out of all bounds ; they are like nothing that ever was before ; they are struck out at one blow , and never alter throughout the course of their imagined existences .

		Yet the world accepts them as types , and accuses nature of copying from
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		I suppose all the great figures of fiction are made in this way .

		They are symbols .

		They are cast by the fused powers of creative imagination .

		Thackeray , with his colder intellectual processes and his more careful copying of truth , never achieves anything like their validity and vitality .

		The very way half wistful , half skep - tical that
Thackeray	PERSON	plays with his characters , treating them as puppets to be explained , criticized , laughed at , betrays a lack of faith which is fatal to great creation .

		Shakespeare , for instance , never has any doubts about his heroes or his monsters or his lovely girls .

		Thackeray , having pulled both his thistles and his roses to pieces , can hardly complain if the world refuses to reassemble them .

		It is almost a commonplace of criticism that
Thack	PERSON	- eray is a great master of style , and that
Dickens	PERSON	is rather a secondary performer on the organ of language .

		If the test of style be an easy and even flow , the university and clubman 's air , matter full of allusiveness yet free from pedantry , then
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's is a standard .

		One page is as good as another ; sentence follows sentence in flawless sequence .

		In comparison ,
Dickens	PERSON	is mannered , extravagant , strained .

		Yet the vivida vis is his .

		His are those collocations of words so apt , so pat to the occasion or character , that they are caught up by the public and become by - words .

		I can not recall a single phrase of
Thackeray	PERSON	's which has passed into general use ; but there are scores of sayings by
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	which are proverbial .

		In descriptive work there is no equality between the two .

		The sensuous quality of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's mind , already noted , gives his language a pictur - esqueness , a distinctness of form and color , which
Thackeray	PERSON	can not pretend to rival .

		Hundreds of his scenes are impressed upon our minds to one that we can recall of
Thackeray 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		When manner - ism and extravagance are urged against him , we can 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, only point out the fact that they are faults of nearly all great English stylists of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Burke	PERSON	.

		Energy and enthusiasm are far more the essence of great style than good taste , propriety , and restraint .

		The first-named qualities are gifts of the genial soul ; the last , of the sober judgment .

		Fecundity of thought and feeling and imagination is the necessary basis of good style ; order and propriety come afterward .

		Thackeray 's style is only the best second-rate ; that of
Dickens	PERSON	has much of the stamp of the masters .

		It was so overwhelmingly successful from the first , it was so copied and imitated and adulterated , that readers in time grew tired of it , and turned for relief to
Thackeray	PERSON	's pellucid but comparatively tame method of writing .

		This last is certainly taking , but it is neither rich in manner nor full in matter .

		Whether in the easy chit-chat of his essays , or in the somewhat platitudinous mor - alizing of his novels , what he has to say does not seem to be either new or important .

		He harps too much on one string .

		After the conclusions of
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	have been reiterated a thousand times , we seem to grow familiar with them .

		When a writer tells us so often that everything is sawdust , we begin to suspect that the style in which he says this is saw - dust also .

		Arnold would not allow that
Addison	PERSON	was a first-rate prose classic , because , however admirable his manner , his matter was not important enough .

		But
Addison	PERSON	in a score of places is more important and profound than
Thackeray	PERSON	ever is .

		I do not say that
Dickens	PERSON	ever reaches any great heights of meaning , but he has the art of notable and reniem - berable expression in prose .

		It is always difficult , in a literary parallel like this , to avoid using one of the pair as a whipping - boy for the other .

		Assuredly , in dealing with life ,
Thackeray	PERSON	has his points of superiority .

		If
Dickens	PERSON	is the more universal ,
Thackeray	PERSON	is the more highly specialized : he knows more and sympathizes better with the educated strata of mankind than
Dickens	PERSON	.

		His intelligent reasoning creations are far more real .

		They are in his line , whether good or evil .

		Warring - ton and Pendennis are successes where
Nickleby	PERSON	and Pip are not ; and if
Becky Sharp	PERSON	and Deuceace are not any more powerfully conceived than
Bill Sykes	PERSON	and the Artful Dodger , they at least show an intellec - tual rather than an emotional trend in their creator .

		On the whole , I should say that
Dickens	PERSON	is a great genius and
Thackeray	PERSON	only a great talent .

		I should rank the former as fourth or fifth in the list of supreme English creative artists which includes
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, and

		THE AMERICO-COCKNEY SIMPLIFIED SPELLING CONFERENCE , as an esteemed English contemporary -LRB- `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' to be explicit -RRB- calls it , has assembled , done its feeble worst , and dispersed .

		In
England	LOCATION	, the home of the more resolutely con - servative spellers , are also and not unnaturally to be found the extreme radicals , who would outdo our friends of No. 1 Madison Avenue in transmogrifying the written form of our common language .

		But the storm of disapproval of all such pseudo-philological antics rages even more violently there than here .

		In the opinion of the above-mentioned journal , '' to ' simplify ' the English language in the way certain faddy professors and professional cranks desire would be a crime of sickening magnitude .

		The theft of a thousand La Giocondas would be nothing to it .

		... We consider these silly and mischievous people to be quite as dangerous as political anarchists , and would suggest the suppression of their meetings by a police-raid . ''

		That , however , would be giving the aid and comfort of martyrdom to their cause .

		The latest leaflet issued by the
American Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	announces the election of seven new members to its number , and exults in the fact that they are all educators and thus destined to promote the new spelling in our schools . ''

		It needs no great acumen , '' the leaflet confidently asserts , `` to see that their teaching as well as their example will soon inform a host of pupils who will never know the old way except as receding phases of antiquity , or as lingering ruins , and who in turn will transmit the modern ideas to their successors .

		If any one imagines that this change will produce revolution and disaster , let him arise before day , and , seeking the upland lawn , observe how gently the sunlight comes in the place of the receding darkness . ''

		The degree of gentleness with which this cacographical dawn is spreading over
England	LOCATION	may be inferred from such cries of indignation as that raised by the English periodical quoted above .

		GREEK LETTERS AS A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH could offer no more convincing testimonial than the still fresh and buoyant aspect and bearing of that veteran student and teacher of Hellenic literature , Profes - sor

		ARNOLD
BENNETT	PERSON	'S CONFESSION , in his autobiographical `` Truth about an Author , '' that after he had become a successful writer he '' did not read much except in the way of business , '' illustrates a phase of literary experience that is , we suspect , commoner than might be thought .

		`` Two hours reading even of Turgenev or Balzac , '' he confesses , '' wearied me out . ''

		He quotes a fellow - author 's arrogant assertion : `` I know enough .

		I do n't read books , I write 'em . '' ''

		Omnivorous readers , '' says , with some truth , a current news - paper paragraph that catches our eye , '' are seldom producers of literature .

		They will write a dozen lines of an article , then lay it aside to consult some book , they become lost in it , and the time for writing is spent . ''

		The late
Lord Acton	PERSON	was an illustration of this disastrous -LRB- or beneficial -RRB- habit .

		Readers of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's letters know how he com - plained of tedium when he had no book on the stocks , since reading bore no comparison to writing as a pastime .

		But he also , it will be recalled , complained even more dolefully of weariness and disgust whenever he had conceived a literary idea and gestation was well begun , while his parturient spasms were something terrifying .

		Dickens and
Thackeray	PERSON	read little in their later and busier years .

		Reading and writing ought to , and not seldom do , go hand in hand ; but if one or the other must be renounced , what person of wisdom and modesty would consent to shut out the great world of other men 's minds in order to imprison himself within that of his own ?

		... LIBRARY TRUSTEES AND COMMISSION GOVERN - MENT have yet to adjust their mutual relationship .

		In
Iowa	LOCATION	, under the commission form of city govern - ment , it remains perplexingly uncertain what powers of library administration are vested in the trustees , and what in the municipal authorities .

		By the leg - islative act granting the new form of government to any city of more than seven thousand inhabitants , the council '' shall possess and exercise all executive , legislative , and judicial powers and duties now had and exercised by the board of public works , park commissioners , water works trustees , and board of library trustees , in all cities wherever such boards now exist or may be hereafter created . ''

		This might be interpreted as an abolition of all the boards and commissions named ; which would of course be ab - surd .

		But as provision is elsewhere made for the appointment of such official bodies , it can only mean that the general powers conferred upon the council are to be exercised vicariously .

		Even this interpre - tation of the law , however , seems to leave room for some tangles and puzzles and conflicts of authority .

		In the mere matter of the number of library trustees to be appointed , doubt has already arisen .

		The city council is empowered to elect , at its first meeting , various specified officers '' and three library trustees , '' which Des Moines understands as limiting these officials to three , whereas
Keokuk	LOCATION	makes the board still to consist , as before , of nine members -LRB- this first appointment of three being but a filling of vacancies occurring under the old law biennially -RRB- , and Cedar Rapids , after halting between two opinions , has returned to the old number that of the muses , in preference to that of the graces .

		Perhaps in practice there will be no serious jars or conflicts under the new law in
Iowa	LOCATION	, but certainly there is a wide-open door for all sorts of legal difficulties and disputes .

		... THE HANDICAP OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME , which renders difficult the quiet and unimpeded working - out of one 's own salvation and accomplishment of one 's peculiar destiny , is what many a descendant of famous ancestors has had to contend against .

		At the present time who can regard with unmixed envy that scion of the
Harvard	PERSON	family who is seek - ing an education in the college bearing his own historic name ?

		The endurance of unsolicited and indiscriminate public attention is a high price to pay for the honor of being descended from a kins - man of
John Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		At
Yale	ORGANIZATION	a great-grandson of the author of the '' Leatherstocking '' series of romances has caused eyes of curiosity and expecta - tion to be turned upon him , and an announcement in the current `` Yale Literary Magazine '' -LRB- which , by the way , must be the oldest extant literary periodical in the country , having been founded by
William M. Evarts	PERSON	in
1837	DATE	-RRB- that a poem by Mr.
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, Jr. , will appear in the next issue , naturally makes one interested in observing whether the young man is likely to distinguish him - self in letters .

		For names of great men all remind us of the possibility that their descendants also may make their lives sublime , and , departing , leave be - hind them footprints either on the history of their time as men of action , or on its literature as men of thought and imagination .

		SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was very much interested in the review of Professor
Dodd	PERSON	's new book on '' Statesmen of the Old South , '' in your issue of
October 16	DATE	.

		The thing of which I wish to speak here is the reviewer 's estimate of the social aspect of the slavery question .

		That is a snbject about which my own mind is not yet fully made up , but I roust ask for further evidence before accepting his view that it was '' slavery as a social problem that drove the South to distraction during the abolition agitation . ''

		After the war began , I am inclined to think that to a large extent it was '' this aspect of slavery , not the property aspect , that welded the Southern people together in resistance to what they considered Northern aggression . ''

		Senators
Toombs	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	had said that it would deter - mine the attitude of the poor whites , and the privileged classes made a clever use of it .

		Just a word on the economic aspect of slavery as an excitant .

		For several weeks past , the discharge of cer - tain civic duties has brought me into close contact with an old Confederate veteran .

		He is very talkative , and frequently refers to his experiences in the war .

		One day I asked him , '' For what did you go to war ? ''

		His reply was , '' Because the Yankees were coming down here and stealing all our property . ''

		I was a little surprised at this answer , but supposed that it had refer - ence to the prospective ultimate emancipation of the slaves in consequence of the triumph of the Republican party .

		To make sure , I asked , '' What property were they stealing ? ''

		Then it came out : '' Why , they were coming down here and helping our niggers to escape . ''

		He was close enough to
Kansas	LOCATION	to feel the wind blowing from the prairies , and this , as well as the economic aspect of slavery , had its influence .

		Your reviewer does not think that emancipation by
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1831	DATE	would have prevented the Civil War , that is , that slavery could not have been abolished without war .

		This reminds me of another remark of the veteran .

		We were discussing a question of policy , and he argued for time .

		In that way , he said , the people could be brought to endure almost anything taxes , in this case .

		He then illustrated by his own attitude toward the the negro .

		In the years that have elapsed since the Civil War , he had passed , partly under compulsion , from regarding the negro as
Chief Justice Taney	ORGANIZATION	did in the Dred
Scott	PERSON	decision , to the point where he could look upon him as a human being with some rights .

		Time can work a good many changes .

		Possibly the last vestige of chattel slavery might not be gone to-day , had there been no war .

		It had not entirely disappeared from
Connecticut	LOCATION	in
1850	DATE	, but it was insignificant .

		It would have been insignificant in the South by this time .

		Four years of war swept it away entirely .

		The war also hastened the development of the industrial slavery which is now gripping the North and slowly creeping over the entire nation .

		In studying the past , let us not assume that such questions can not be settled without war .

		What we need is a higher type of statesmanship than we had in

		`` STATESMEN OF THE OLD SOUTH . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The friendly notice of my little book , '' Statesmen of the Old South , '' in your issue of
October 16	DATE	, is so much appreciated that I trust I may have a few lines of space in which to reply to a few minor points made by your reviewer .

		The first relates to his objection to the term '' peasant farmers . ''

		This term is certainly a fair desig - nation of the nation in
1800	DATE	; that the farmers were owners of the land they tilled , does not alter the fun - damental fact .

		Perhaps it would be better to say , with a recent president of the
American Historical Associa	ORGANIZATION	-
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 tion , `` peasant proprietors . ''

		But this is not a matter that would of itself call for much argument .

		On the question of emancipation in
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1831	DATE	there is better reason for two opinions .

		I have ex - pressed my view after more than ten years of study and teaching of Southern history .

		Others who have devoted more time and more intelligence to the subject have a perfect right to say I am wrong .

		But about the
Davis	PERSON	family being of the '' hardshell '' Baptist persuasion , it may not be improper for me to say that when writing the '' Life of Davis '' I went over the whole field of the Southern Baptist sects , that I visited
Mississippi	LOCATION	and talked with people who ought to know , and it would therefore seem that my judgment on this point should not be ruled out of court by the simple ipse dixit of the reviewer .

		Being a
Southern Baptist	ORGANIZATION	myself , and reared in close proximity to a '' hardshell '' community , I might without immodesty claim to know the difference between `` regular '' and `` hardshell '' Baptists .

		It was stated in the study of
Davis	PERSON	that his first mar - riage was clandestine .

		Having read a mass of contro - versial literature on this subject , visited the house , near
Louisville	LOCATION	, where the wedding took place , and talked with people who were familiar with local traditions , my conclu - sion was that
Colonel Taylor	PERSON	never gave his consent , and that he did not know of the event when it occurred ; and that therefore it was clandestine .

		In support of my view , Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	the second , who generally avoided the subject , may be cited .

		See her
Memoir of Davis	ORGANIZATION	, Vol .

		I. , page 161 .

		Your reviewer further says that
Davis	PERSON	was not a brigadier general in the Mexican War .

		But neither did I say he was -LRB- see page 186 -RRB- .

		He did , however , win that rank ; the commission was offered him by President
Polk	PERSON	, and was declined ; and he was called '' General '' by his friends , by his enemies , and by the newspapers , from
1847	DATE	to
1857	DATE	, when the title of '' Senator '' became the more common appellation .

		But I was careful not to mislead the reader , and so wrote '' General ''
Davis	PERSON	when the title was used at all -LRB- see page 186 -RRB- .

		Finally , whether or not the South went to war for '' economic '' or '' social '' reasons , the opinion of one student is as good as that of another ; and I venture to stand to the claim already made , and '' wait to be shown '' that it was to any great extent a '' social psycho - logical '' revolution which was precipitated by the lower South in
1861	DATE	.

		There is ground enough for criticism of the book , for taking issue with my interpretation of history or historical movements ; but it hardly seems just to take exception to points like those above men - tioned , merely saying that what I have said is '' not so . ''

		Hence I have felt constrained to offer this rejoinder , even though this might seem to be asking a good deal of space for a book of such modest proportions .

1906	DATE	-RRB- was , as stated by a correspondent in your issue of

		This , which I had overlooked at first , recognizes the American publisher , but still leaves undescribed the edi - tion that is known here in
America	LOCATION	as the '' First Folio '' edition , in forty volumes , now nearing completion .

		May I take this opportunity to record an important omission which I failed to get into the proof of my article on the
Shakespeare Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	?

		This is
Charles Crawford	PERSON	's concordance to the quarto and folio Hamlets , which was published as a '' Hamlet Appendix '' to the '' Concordance to the Works of
Thomas Kyd	PERSON	, '' in vol .

		xv .

		of the
Materialen zur Kunde	PERSON	des Alteren En - glischen Dramas .

		The blame for this lies partly with the publishers of that volume , who give on the title-page no evidence of the inclusion of this important appendix , which is thus very likely to escape library cataloguers as it escaped Mr.
Jaggard	PERSON	.

		It may be worth noting , too , that Mr.
Jaggard	PERSON	has seen fit to record '' Batman uppon Bartholome , ''
1582	DATE	, to the exclusion of the older edition of
Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	published by Berthelet in
1535	DATE	, though it seems quite as plausible that

		In a recent issue of your journal -LRB-

		I write to ask whether your authority sanctions the use of such an expression as '' without a genuine passion being the basis of his present poetry . '' ''

		Without a genuine passion being '' seems to me awkward and inf e - licitious .

		Can you recall any high precedent for such an expression ?

		-LSB- The use of the possessive -LRB- `` without a genuine passion 's being '' -RRB- is preferred by many in such con - structions as the foregoing ; but as early as 1600 the other usage had become common , as in '' Macbeth '' I. iii .

		44 , '' By each at once her choppy finger laying upon her skinny lips . ''

		Coming down much later , we find in `` Vanity Fair , '' chapter XL , `` I insist upon Miss Sharp appearing / ' and

		In certain instances the possessive would be intolerably awkward , as '' Upon the king and his court making their entry , '' '' In the expectation of one or the other being present . ''

		The authority of the

		* There is at least one man to whom ''
Tom Johnson	PERSON	's '' story of his own life should come as a revelation and that is the man who is already before the people with a book on the same subject , the most striking feature of which was the opinion that
Johnson	PERSON	was not at heart sincere in the policies with which he so vigor - ously identified himself , but took them up as the most promising means of attaining to high political position .

		One may pick many a flaw in the career of
Tom L. Johnson	PERSON	; but this vol - ume , taken from his own dictation as his last legacy to the public , during the weeks when he was aware that disease was fast crowding him toward the brink of the grave , bears overwhelm - ing testimony to his absolute sincerity a quality which no one who really knew him had ever doubted .

		Johnson was born at
Blue Spring	ORGANIZATION	,
Ken	PERSON	- tucky , in
1854	DATE	.

		His father had a plantation in
Arkansas	LOCATION	, and at
Helena	LOCATION	organized a military company in the service of the
Confederacy	LOCATION	.

		As colonel of a brigade , a little later , he fell into disagreement with his superior officer , Gen - eral
Hindman	PERSON	, and left him to join the com - mand of
General John C. Breckenridge	ORGANIZATION	, near
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		He took his family to
Georgia	LOCATION	with him , making the long journey in two wagons and a barouche .

		After about a year in
Georgia	LOCATION	they went North by similar means of travel through the
Carolinas	LOCATION	into
Virginia	LOCATION	, locating at
Corner Springs	LOCATION	, next at
Withville	LOCATION	, then at Natural Bridge for a year , and at Staunton as the war was closing .

		After a short time the family moved to
Louisville	LOCATION	,

Arkansas	LOCATION	on borrowed funds for a short and disastrous experiment in raising cotton with free labor ; and from there to
Evansville	LOCATION	,

		who had just acquired a street railway in that city .

		In a few months he was secretary of the company , and afterward superintendent of the road .

		This office he held until
1876	DATE	, when , with financial aid from
Bidermann du Pont	ORGANIZATION	, he purchased from
William H. English	PERSON	a controll - ing interest in the street railways of Indian - apolis .

		In this business he proved successful from the start ; and a few years later he entered the street-railway field of
Cleveland	LOCATION	by the pur - chase of the Pearl Street line , on the
West Side	LOCATION	.

		His subsequent grants were secured as exten - sions to this line .

		So much has been written of
Johnson	PERSON	's long fight for lower fares against the entrenched traction interests of
Cleveland	LOCATION	that we need not stop to outline the story here .

		We need only say that any who were led by the inevitable misrepresentations of the conflict into the belief that it was in any way a fight for his personal financial interests will find overwhelm - ing proof to the contrary in this volume .

		Tom
L. Johnson	PERSON	had in him the making of a
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	in point of wealth , had not his devotion to certain ideas turned so much of his energy and brain-power in other directions .

		This feature of his career had its genesis in the writings of
Henry George	PERSON	, to whose memory this autobiography is dedicated .

		In
1883	DATE	John - son got hold of a copy of George 's '' Social Problems '' on a train , and '' Progress and Poverty '' soon followed , with such other of the author 's works as had then appeared .

		From that time on he was in theory an entire convert to
George	PERSON	's teachings , and convinced of their complete practicability whenever the people could be persuaded in good faith to adopt them .

		So long , however , as law and custom allowed privilege to remain , he would use it in his busi - ness ; and if people chose to rail at him for incon - sistency in attacking the goose that was laying his -LRB- and their -RRB- golden eggs , well and good .

		Thus , while in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he boldly fought for the entire removal of the tariff on steel rails , notwithstanding his own heavy investments in their manufacture , at
Johnstown	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		His
Johnstown	LOCATION	enterprise threw upon him and his chief associate , Mr.
Arthur J. Moxham	PERSON	, a heavy share of responsibility for the relief measures made necessary by the flood disaster of
1889	DATE	.

		Immediately after the flood which had not involved his own plant , situated on higher ground he and his associates purchased the
Johnstown	LOCATION	street-railway system , and for some time operated the cars free of any charge , as a part of the relief work .

		That experience led him seriously to discuss the feasibility of
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 333 free street-car service everywhere .

		The idea that people would abuse such service by riding unnecessarily , he meets with the statement that they do nothing of the kind with the free eleva - tor service in constant operation in every city in the land .

		The cost of such service , he thought , would distribute itself equitably in the end , like the cost of keeping up the streets themselves over which the cars run ; and the demoralizing effects of franchise granting would be elimi - nated .

		One of his first active steps in the
Henry George	PERSON	propaganda was the gift of a copy of '' Protection or Free Trade '' to every minister and lawyer in
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		Of this early effort he writes : '' Why do converts to social ideals always select these most unlikely of all professions in the world as objects for conversion in their campaigns in behalf of new ideals ?

		I had not yet discovered that ' it is the un - learned who are ever the first to seize and comprehend through the heart 's logic the newest and most daring truths . ' ''

		The chances are , of course , that so far as that particular book was concerned the legal and ministerial objects of his missionary endeavor were mostly believers in its Free Trade doctrine already .

		In
1895	DATE	the well-known editorial writer , Mr.
Louis F. Post	PERSON	, came to
Cleveland	LOCATION	to work upon a new newspaper , '' The Recorder , '' which championed
George	PERSON	's doctrines ; and
John	PERSON	- son immediately came to its support , contribut - ing in all about
$ 80,000	MONEY	to meet its deficits , until the panic of
1897	DATE	hit him so severely as to compel the withdrawal of further subsidies .

		It will be remembered that while in
Congress Johnson	ORGANIZATION	had been instrumental , with three or four others , in getting the whole of
George	ORGANIZATION	's book on the Tariff into the '' Congressional Record , `` through the custom of `` leave to print , '' and thus hundreds of thousands of copies were distributed all over the country under the franking system .


Johnson	PERSON	was not really a believer in this custom of campaigning at pub - lic expense ; but so long as the Protectionists were thus circulating tons of documents which he believed to be false , he did not see why the other side should not circulate what he consid - dered true .

		It was
George	PERSON	who first urged
Johnson	PERSON	to go into politics , and who first suc - ceeded in getting him to attempt a public speech , in a mass-meeting in
Cooper Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		His five minutes of dismal failure on that occasion gave little promise of the effective debater into which he had developed when
Theodore Burton	PERSON	, now Senator , challenged him to a joint discussion during the campaign of
1890	DATE	, when the two were rival candidates for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and
Burton	PERSON	was defeated .

		Of this debate
Johnson	PERSON	says : `` As the challenged party I claimed the right to name the terms of the contest , and in the final arrange - ment it was agreed that each side should make five ten-minute speeches in each debate .

		In the two years which had elapsed since my first effort in
Cooper Union	LOCATION	, I had increased my time limit to ten minutes , and for that space I could talk like a whirlwind , though I prob - ably could not have spokeu longer at one stretch to save my life .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	was a lawyer , a scholar , a master of English , a practiced speaker if not an orator , but hig style was deliberate and it was next to impossible for him to get fairly started under eleven minutes ... I went to the first of those engagements with an out - ward show of cheerfulness and confidence which I was very far from feeling , but I had no serious apprehensions after the first night .

		The ten-minute rule saved me and I won the election .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	refused to run against me
two years later	DATE	, and when he was the opposition candidate for Mayor of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, fifteen years afterwards , he declined absolutely to debate with me in person . ''

		One of the most interesting passages in the volume is
Johnson	PERSON	's account of his attempts to get upon the tax duplicate an honest valuation of
Ohio	LOCATION	railroad properties .

		He failed of im - mediate success , but not until he had brought public attention so forcibly to the gross under - valuation of those properties that the fraud was plainly doomed , even before his death .

		During the few months since , the
State Tax Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion has raised every such property in
Ohio	LOCATION	from two or three to six or eight times its previous valuation , and it is still at work on a readjustment of valuation of other similarly underestimated concerns .

		As a politician ,
Johnson	PERSON	contracted too much of the despotic habit of the '' boss , '' though never the boss 's penchant for feathering his own nest , or that of his associates , by graft .

		Unscrupulous in certain matters he may fairly be called , from the nicer point of view ; but never in the direction of robbing the people .

		We need not follow him in all the theories which he imbibed from the school of
Henry George	PERSON	, in order to recognize in him a thoroughly sincere worker for the good of his own city and of hu - manity in general .

		Though aligned in most mat - ters with the Democratic party , he was never a narrow partisan , and was always ready with a flat refusal to party workers who came to him with demands for removals or appointments on simply partisan grounds .

		He had a personal magnetism for men who worked with him , so powerful as to make Republicans whom he had retained or appointed in the city 's service his devoted supporters ; and this naturally led to the charge that their support was simply bought by appointment or retention a charge which , 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, to the sober judgment , is amply refuted by the character of the men in question .

		On such points as the regulation of the liquor traffic and the restraint of prostitution , many felt that his views were not up to the really practicable level of the day .

		A higher standard of decency might well have been enforced upon the cheap theatres of
Cleveland	LOCATION	during his administration -LRB- and since -RRB- .

		In the humane and intelligent care of delinquent boys and girls , of the depen - dent classes , and of the milder forms of adult criminality , the Rev.
Harris R. Cooley	PERSON	, formerly pastor of the church with which Mayor
Johnson	PERSON	was connected , and appointed by him as head of the city 's charitable and correctional institu - tions , attained results from which the great majority of cities in the whole country might well take lessons .

		Within certain limits , one might say that
Tom L. Johnson	PERSON	was to the typical reformer of the higher order what
Billy Sunday	PERSON	is to the typical Doctor of Divinity a little short in logical consistency , not well developed in his bump of reverence for the con - ventionalities , given to shocking the suscepti - bilities of '' the well-bred , '' but after all genu - inely effective in persuading large numbers to '' hit the sawdust trail '' toward better things .

		Under present conditions ,
America	LOCATION	can afford more rather than fewer of such characters .

		THE
AMERICAN NEWSPAPER DRAMA	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The history of the American stage has yet to be written .

		The American drama , as a living and independent entity , can hardly be said to be : it is merely becoming .

		But the stage has existed from before the Revolution , and the record of its development would be an interest - ing chapter in the social and literary life of the nation .

		It is rather the stage than the drama that is the subject of Mr.
Moses	PERSON	's book , even though he calls it '' The American Dramatist , '' for he gives only a very slight idea of the actual movements that have marked the progress of dramatic development from the beginning to the present , and he does present a somewhat sketchy survey of matters theatrical from the legitimate and the poetic drama to the hybrid musical comedy and the moving-picture shows .

		The whole history of American drama from
1750	DATE	to
1870	DATE	is here compressed into one short chap - ter , and very little idea is given of the meaning of the drama in the cultural development of * THE AMERICAN DRAMATIST .

		By
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	.

		With portraits .

		Boston : Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the nation .

		We are referred to learned articles and dissertations for a discussion of the early German influence ; but its import we do not learn ; very little is said about the highly potent bearing of the French drama upon the
Ameri	PERSON	- can , either in the past or in the present .

		No adequate treatment appears of the various types of plays that held the stage in the early days the war dramas of the Revolution and of
1812	DATE	, the plays that reflected or caricatured local eccentricities , whether Yankee or Southern or Western .

		What were these plays in reality mere imitations of foreign models , or futile attempts to strike out new forms ?

		One fully realizes that in quality the product was poor , that probably in the whole first century of theatrical production there was not one play of permanent dramatic worth ; yet the history of the drama in its struggle to reflect the social life of the time , in its groping after form and idea , is worth while .

		And this history is yet to seek .

		By far the greater part of Mr.
Moses	PERSON	's book is taken up with the modern stage , and it is largely a development of the conception that the drama to-day is the newspaper dramatized .

		The modern dramatist has largely been bred in the newspaper office , and partly on that account , but more because Americans are a newspaper - reading nation par excellence , the modern drama is like the newspaper .

		`` Newspaper condition , i.e. , as the American newspaper sees American condition , '' says Mr.
Moses	PERSON	, `` is the one original note in our theatre . ''

		The trouble , of course , lies in the fact that the dramatist is satisfied to present in dramatic form so called what is paraded in the
Sunday	DATE	papers or in the ten-cent magazines , and the public are gratified to have the muck-raking visualized on the stage .

		The stage has never been far removed from the news - paper , for both appeal immediately and directly to the crowd .

		One has only to recall the '' suc - cess '' of Addison 's '' Cato , '' which was as much a newspaper drama for that time as Frank Nor - ris 's '' The Pit '' is for to-day . ''

		The School for Scandal '' did some muck-raking , too ; but it did much else .

		It is not that the drama is closely related to the newspaper , it can not be otherwise and be vital , but it is vastly more .

		There must be in it that which transcends con - temporaneousness and has a kind of eternity ; it must deal primarily with human passions that are the same for all people and for all times .

		And yet to do so it must be native to the soil .

		THE DIAL 335 verisimilitude , made Elizabethan apprentices raise a riot in the streets of
Verona	LOCATION	in '' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' and had an English mob shout ap - proval of Antony 's speech in ''
Julius Ca3sar	PERSON	. ''

		So the coming American play must not be false to the native spirit ; it may still keep the exterior semblance to the newspaper , with its snappy dialogue , its wit , and its local color ; but more than that , it must reach down to the depths of our American life , it must plumb passions as profound as those which have been exhibited in the great crises of our history .

		It is not true that we '' have never , save in the days of extreme Puritanism , had spiritual struggle , '' as Mr.
Moses	PERSON	avers ; and this accordingly can not be urged as a reason for our not having great drama .

		Surely the Civil War was as great a spiritual struggle as one can find in the history of any nation ; and yet how little literature of any value was produced as a result of that struggle !

		Big events , vast conflicts , are often barren of literary fruit ; whereas an uneventful experience like that of
Keats	PERSON	, or a period of comparative calm like the lifetimes of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Brown	PERSON	- ing , will see poetry of a high order .

		The spir - itual struggle is within the man , the poet , the dramatist ; and according to his power will his work be .

		So it is to the man of genius our eyes are turned , and not to any impending spiritual conflict .

		There is sufficient emotion pent up in the nation to furnish the response to the appeal a genius will make .

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	devotes some half-dozen chapters to the leading dramatists of the past forty years
Bronson Howard	PERSON	,
James A. Herne	PERSON	,
David Belasco	PERSON	,
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	and his father , Au - gustus
Thomas	PERSON	,
William Gillette	PERSON	, and
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	.

		And yet even here , where materials are more abundant and the dramatic product is more inspiring , Mr.
Moses	PERSON	merely gives us chatty comments on works and methods , with necessary though somewhat barren lists of plays and dates , rather than anything like exhaustive criticism .

		In fact , one does not need the occa - sional fling at academic scholarship to infer that the author and it are hardly on speaking terms .

		-LRB- Witness , Mrs.
Aphra Behn	PERSON	of unblessed memory appears as `` one Afara Behn '' -RRB- .


Bronson Howard	PERSON	, who is regarded as the Dean of the profession and rightly so because he stood out first and always for the American dramatist as against the foreigner , is not dis - cussed in such a way as to bring out his signifi - cance as an insurgent against the old order and a pioneer in the new .

		Was it merely that he used strictly American subjects ?

		How far was his technique a departure , if at all , from that of his contemporaries ?

		To what extent may he be credited or charged with putting the news - paper on the stage after the modern method ?

		What definite contribution in form or thought did he make ?

		Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	is considered as a playwright , as an opponent of the Trust , and as a stage-manager or , as Mr.
Moses	PERSON	would call him , a psychologist of the switch-board .

		In the development of the drama from the point of view of form and ideas , Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	is not revealed as a great contributor .

		His function as a fosterer of drama and as an amazingly clever stage-manager , especially in the manipula - tion of light effects , might better have been treated in a separate chapter on the develop - ment of the art of staging .

		In other words , a work of this kind were better considered in its relation to ideas than to individuals .

		The most satisfactory of these chapters is that on
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	.

		It is evidently written con amore , for one realizes that the author has here a dramatist of great accomplishment and of still greater promise unhappily cut short by an untimely death .

		There is , moreover , a unity in
Fitch	LOCATION	's work that admits of its being con - sistently treated in one chapter .

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	grasps the significance of this work admirably , and is not carried beyond critical bounds in his enthusiasm for it .

		Fitch 's plays , for the most part , have the sparkle of clever newspaper inter - viewing , the contemporaneousness of the public prints ; and they have also the human interest and the human appeal which reach farther than the ephemeral '' stories '' of the press .

		On the other hand , as Mr.
Moses	PERSON	points out , they are preeminently local
New York	LOCATION	rather than American ; and they point the way which
Fitch	ORGANIZATION	himself , it seems , was about to take towards the greater American drama .

		Of Mr.
Moses	PERSON	's conception of the drama as expressing the deepest social consciousness of the people and as depending upon the people for support , of his estimate of present condi - tions involving the tyranny of the Trust and the invasion of the kinetoscope , we have only the warmest commendation .

		He neither judges the present product too leniently nor does he despair of the future .

		Like Professor
Matthews	PERSON	and Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	, he sees that the poetic drama should be dramatic first and poetic afterwards , if the product is to satisfy the demands of art .

		Pleasing though the work of
Miss Peabody	LOCATION	is , it sacrifices dramatic propriety to poetic flavor , and so suffers .

		Mr.
Martin Schiitze	PERSON	's `` Hero and Leander '' and ``
Judith	PERSON	, '' 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, which singularly are overlooked by Mr.
Moses	PERSON	, are also more poetic than dramatic .

		There is no literary form from which more can be hoped in this country that from the drama .

		The theatre is the meeting-place for people from all parts of the nation , and in no other way can the writer come into such close contact with the great public .

		The dramatist , as he follows the progress of his play over the country , comes to know the common mind and heart as the novelist can not .

		He must make his appeal so as to reach that mind and heart ; in other words , he must be as universal as his genius will allow and as exalted in his concep - tion of the sacredness of his art as his moral consciousness will make possible .

		As Mr.
Moses	PERSON	rightly recognizes , the dramatist may not be forced into sudden and rapid growth by the aid of endowed theatres and learned com - mittees to pass on plays Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	to the contrary notwithstanding .

		The play - wright must meet a public need , and help also to increase that need .

		The public will for a surprisingly long time feed on chaff , if served with the infinite variety of breakfast-foods , and think they are satisfied .

		But in the end they will demand stronger food , and it is for the dramatist to give them something better and to improve his own product .

		Thereby will he in - crease the public appetite for better things .

		GOETHE 'S FRIENDSHIPS WITH WOMEN .

		* ''
Goethe	PERSON	and his Woman Friends '' is a com - panionable book to read , to enjoy , to re-read , and to linger over in affectionate intimacy .

		The author touches the facts with an entirely legiti - mate enthusiasm that invests these significant figures with a glowing atmosphere in which it does the soul good to remain .

		To treat of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's nearest friendships is an exacting and rather thankless task : some who have attempted it have become offended to such a degree that they have lost all sense of propor - tion and the power of fair judgment ; fully as many myopic
Goethe	PERSON	- worshippers -LRB- like Diintzer -RRB- seem simply incapable of reckoning with unpleas - ant facts , and indulge in evasions and symbolic interpretations which outdo the most ingenious feats of mediaeval hermeneutics .

		opposing perfect clearness to obscurity and hazy inaccuracy , proves almost too heroic a thing , at times , for the most resolute courage .

		Even the severe and impersonal
Weimar	LOCATION	editors omit certain of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's manuscript lines from the same considerations of piety , no doubt , which prompt the withholding of parts of Washing - ton 's correspondence from popular knowledge .

		Our author deserves the highest praise for having courageously taken the narrow path of truth , and for having held to it gallantly : while there are wide tracts of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's nature which remain unexplored in this survey , the spoils that are brought in are of priceless value .

		Women have ofttimes been the most devoted worshippers of Goethe and the most efficient promoters of his fame , one has only to think of the
Berlin	LOCATION	cult in the earlier part of the nine - teenth century , and it is altogether appropriate that certain stages in his ever expanding life , important sides of his universal nature , should be interpreted through his friendships with women .

		In addition to a genial and most agreeable style ,
Miss Crawford	PERSON	's well-proportioned work shows solid scholarly qualities : its point of view is intelligent , and it has that freshness which comes only from a valiant exploiting of the best sources .

		There is an almost incredible sanity and breadth of spirit in dealing with alien val - ues .

		The author 's most illuminating aperqu lies , perhaps , in her explaining the overwhelm - ing charm of
Frau von Stein	PERSON	, less from that lady 's intellectual kinship to the poet than from her gift of interested receptivity .

		Of rare moral dignity is the figure of
Duchess Louise	PERSON	, for which the author has made good use of Fraiilein von
Bojanowski	PERSON	's distinguished study .

		The quality of the book is admirably sustained though it declines somewhat toward the close , in the direction of merely entertaining anecdote .

		In a volume which touches upon so many sharply-outlined personalities , it would be strange if there were no estimates that seemed open to challenge .

		For my own part , I can not but feel that the contemptuous treatment of the character of Father Goethe is unfair , to the very verge of flippancy .

		I believe that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	would have been less of a man and a poet had it not been for '' des Lebens ernstes Filhren '' which he derived from this man of uncompro - mising and puritan standards .

		The identifica - tion of the Margarete of '' Faust '' with the
Gretchen	PERSON	of
Frankfort	LOCATION	involves a salto mortale into the tenuous air of unsupported conjecture ; while the everlasting identification of
Christiane Vulpius	PERSON	and her life-history with the chief

		The story of the poet 's relation to
Katchen Schonkopf	PERSON	-LRB- who receives here the married name ''
Kanne	PERSON	'' -RRB- needs to be re-written in the full light of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's letters after leav - ing Leipsic .

		The author hardly makes clear in what sense
Friederike Brion	PERSON	may function as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Beatrice . ''

		It seems really too bad that in the treatment of what is styled '' the little romance '' of
Ulrike von Levetzow	PERSON	-LRB- '' die lieblichste der licblichsten Gestalten '' ! -RRB-

		there is no mention of the
Marien	PERSON	- bad Elegy , perhaps the most compelling verses of the sort ever written , the deep expression of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's genuine suffering , the most construc - tive embodiment of his religious faith , a poem which seems to have left its clear mark on the opening lines of ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	. ''

		A list of minor inaccuracies could be drawn up , if it seemed worth while , but the book ex - hibits commendable fidelity in securing trust - worthy information .

		Amine of '' Die Laune des Verliebten '' appears as `` Arnina '' -LRB- p. 42 -RRB- .

		The complacency expressed on page 372 because of the '' non-execution '' of
Bettina	PERSON	's sketch of the
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	- and-Psyche statuary would have been suddenly dashed if the author had chanced to enter the hallway of the
Weimar Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and had been confronted by
Steinhauser	PERSON	's huge marble group .

		The English substitutes for
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's finished classical distichs which are offered on pages 210 , 440 , and 445 , are too painful for comment ; one prefers to walk back - ward with averted gaze .

		The seventy-seven pictures , conscientiously gathered from scattered sources , and nearly all of original historic value , add largely to the worth and attractiveness of this distinctly inviting book .

		Over the British life of `` The Mother of Goethe '' we need not linger .

		It is a beauti - fully made book , with remarkably clear and soft pictures , and it will serve to give the unexact - ing English reader a fair human acquaintance with its dynamic and always captivating subject ; but it lacks both distinction and perspective .

		It consists mostly of translations from '' Dichtung und Wahrheit '' interspersed with too-copious extracts from Whe well 's deplorable version of ''
Hermann	PERSON	und Dorothea '' which are anything but '' Goetheresque '' to borrow a term from the work .

		The sloppy inaccuracy is a constant irritation : '' Evangelene , '' '' die gute Mutter , '' '' Trauberspiegel '' ``
Eric Smith	PERSON	, '' ''
Kronungs	PERSON	- stadt '' `` JSrockenheimer , '' and the rest , and the excursions into the domain of criticism are naive to the point of humor .

		More respect , kind English friends , for the integrity of the great German dead !

		This sort of publication is far more likely to be '' made in
Great Britain	LOCATION	'' than in the
United States of America	LOCATION	, a fact in which our native scholars may take legitimate satisfaction .

TAFT HATFIELD	ORGANIZATION	.

		A TRUE DAUGHTER OF
NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* Recalling her parents ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	emphasized three qualities which prevailed in the atmosphere of her early home : '' wit , wisdom , and sweetness . ''

		These traits were transfused into her own per - sonality , which has been so fully and tenderly revealed by her friend , Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	, in the volume of letters which are edited with fine taste and judgment .

		The graciousness and '' sweet dignity '' which characterized Miss
Jewett	PERSON	are found also in this revealment of her life through her letters to various friends in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		By far the larger num - ber were written to Mrs. Fields , and the occa - sional words of the editor are full of understand - ing and affection , as well as a true appreciation of the literary worth of one of
New England	LOCATION	's most charming and sincere story-tellers .

		From the days of her childhood the '' white mile-stone days '' when she rode with her father in his doctor 's chaise and learned to love nature and humanity to the end of her productive years ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	was impelled by one great purpose : '' to make life a little easier for others . ''

		She accomplished this service in her neighborly relations , and also in her work as writer .

		She sympathized deeply with the domestic joys and trials of her fellow - villagers , and carried the same tenderly responsive heart into all places where she went .

		Toward the people whom she chose as models for her vital characters , many of whom lived near her home , she always kept the attitude of mind of a neighbor and friend ; never did she assume a touch of the patronizing or curious visitor to the country .

		She rejoiced to be a part of the life which she depicted , and one of her early ambitions was to bring city and country people into more intimate and sympa - thetic relations .

		Find - ing herself in some dim way the owner of this sacred touchstone , what wonder that she loved her work and believed in it ? ''

		In spite of her native dignity and a certain remoteness of manner ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	entered into every phase of life with keen senses .

		She de - lighted to drive , to row , to picnic , and to coast on one memorable occasion on a borrowed sled down the village hillside with such success that her nephew was proud of her reputation among his boy-friends , for `` she went down side-saddle over the hill just like the rest of the boys . ''

		She loved nature with the trustfulness of a child .

		Like
Thoreau	PERSON	, she personified the pines and con - sidered them her noble friends .

		The scenic beauty of her stories , from ''
Marsh Rosemary	PERSON	, '' '' White Heron , '' and '' The Country Doctor , '' to ''
Deephaven	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' The Country of the Pointed Firs , '' was inspired by her walks and drives within a short distance of her Berwick home , and such tales reflected her loving com - radeship with trees and flowers and birds .

		The letters contain many exquisite nature-pictures , often warmed by tender sentiment .

		A few examples may be given . ''

		Hepaticas are like some people , very dismal blue , with cold hands and faces .

		... I believe there is noth - ing dearer than a trig little company of anemones in a pasture , all growing close together as if they kept each other warm , and wanted the whole sun to themselves , beside .

		They had no business to wear their
summer	DATE	frocks so early in the year . ''

		... '' But , oh !

		I have found such a corner of this world , under a spruce tree , where I sit for hours together , and neither thought nor good books can keep me from watching a little golden bee , that seems to live quite alone , and to be laying up honey against cold weather .

		He may have been idle and now feels belated , and goes and comes from his little hole in the ground close by my knee , so that I can put my hand over his front door and shut him out , but I promise you and him that I never will .

		He took me for a boulder the first day we met ; but after he flew round and round he understood things , and knows now that I come and go as other boulders do , by glacial ac - tion , and can do him no harm .

		A very handsome little bee , and often to be thought of by me , come winter . ''

		Although
Miss Jewett	PERSON	localized her back - grounds and characters , and thereby gained in vitality and genuineness , she carried her keen observation and clever descriptive pen upon trips abroad , and wrote delightful impressions of
Whitby	LOCATION	and
Nassau	LOCATION	, of the lilies and night - ingales of
France	LOCATION	, and the romantic associations of
Haworth	PERSON	and the
Bronte	LOCATION	vicarage .

		One of the rare experiences of her foreign visits was her acquaintance with
Tennyson	PERSON	, whom she revered . ''

		He seemed like a king in captivity , one of the kings of old , of divine rights and sacred seclusions .

		None of the great gifts I have ever had out of loving and being with you seems to me so great as having seen
Tennyson	PERSON	, '' so she wrote to Mrs. Fields .

		These letters give a partial record of Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's literary likings and indulgences .

		They show wide range of subjects , and '' heavy doses , '' so that one appreciates her fear that she '' has been overeating with her head . ''

		Her impressions of books are keen and critical , in - cluding comments on anatomy and politics as well as distinctive literature .

		In preparation for her `` History of the Normans , '' and her historical novel `` The Tory Lover , '' she cov - ered much ground in history .

		Thackeray and
Carlyle	PERSON	were favorites with her , and to
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	she gives merited praise , both for literary skill in '' A Tour in
Scotland	LOCATION	'' and also for her stimulating influence upon her poet-brother and upon
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	acknowledges a debt to Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's '' Pearl of
Orr	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	, '' as an early incentive to her own simple
New England	LOCATION	stories .

		Although in her later work there was greater variety of struc - ture and characters , yet she maintained her chosen type of fiction and gave life to what Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	calls '' the lovely
New England	LOCATION	land - scape and the genuine
New England	LOCATION	nature . ''

		She always defended the art of realism . ''

		People talk about dwelling upon trivialities and commonplaces in life , but a master writer gives every - thing weight , and makes you feel the distinction and im - portance of it , and count it upon the right or the wrong side of a life 's account .

		That is one reason why writing about simple country people takes my time and thought . ''

		Again , in
1907	DATE	, she wrote to Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	words of sane , sweet philosophy about her work and a writer 's supreme efforts . ''

		What a joyful time it is to be close to the end of a long piece of work , and sad too , like coming into har - bour at the end of a voyage .

		The more one has cared to put one 's very best into a thing the surer he is to think that it falls far short of the < sky he meant . '

		But it is certain that everything is in such a work that we have put in .

		The sense of failure that weighs the artist down is often nothing but a sense of fatigue .

		I always think that the trees look tired in

White Hills	ORGANIZATION	, standing proudly over its first crop of yellow apples all fallen into a little almost hollow of the soft turf below .

		I could look over its head , and it would have been a heart of stone that did not beat fast with sympathy .

		`` Though I feel like a dissected map with a few pieces gone , the rest of me seems to be put together right ! ''

		Bowdoin College hon - ored itself when it conferred upon
Miss Jewett	PERSON	the degree of Litt.D. , and she delighted `` to be the single sister of so many brothers at Bow - doin . ''

		Six DECADES OF TRADE UNIONISM IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* In nearly all its important aspects , the history of the labor movement in the
United States	LOCATION	re - peats that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		English artisans brought the institution of unionism to this country , and men trained in the English trade unions have not infrequently been the leaders in the class struggle in
America	LOCATION	.

		The colonial period of our history shows prac - tically no trace of this organization of the wage - earners .

		A permanent wage-earning class was almost unknown at this time ; and even if indi - viduals could have been found who spent their entire lives working for hire , they were the least aggressive members of the population , and hence were not suited to become the leaders of a new social movement .

		can Revolution , however , there emerged in our leading cities a permanent class of journeymen laborers ; and when commercial changes were taking place which threatened a deterioration of products and a lowering of the wage scale , it is not surprising to find that these journeymen began to unite in clubs for mutual protection , nor is it surprising to find that the success with which they at times resisted the masters led them to make demands which at times became unreasonable .

		A remedy for this situation , also borrowed from
Europe	LOCATION	, was at hand .

		This was the prose - cution of the troublesome labor-unions for con - spiring to raise wages and otherwise obstruct trade .

		The records of a number of these Ameri - can trials for conspiracy were given in some of the earlier volumes of the work under review , and were referred to in an earlier notice of the work in THE DIAL -LRB-
October 1 , 1910	DATE	-RRB- .

		But persecution , whether it be legal or other - wise , seldom puts an end to a political or social movement ; and trade unionism in
America	LOCATION	did not cease with the conviction of the conspirators .

		Public opinion was far less hostile to the unions than it was in
England	LOCATION	prior to
1825	DATE	, and the penalities imposed upon the laborers who had entered into these illegal combinations reflect the more tolerant attitude of the courts and the people .

		Nevertheless , these trials did serve among other causes to bring about a closer union of the labor organizations and to cause them to enter politics .

		Their desire to be freed from criminal prosecutions was not , however , the principal cause of the political labor movement which began about
1830	DATE	.

		Briefly stated , the political demands of the laboring classes were , -LRB- 1 -RRB- free schools supported by taxation ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- aboli - tion of imprisonment for debt ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- mechanics ' lien laws ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- abolition of compulsory militia service .

		Professor Commons says : '' These were the primary demands of the labor parties .

		They show that what the working man of the thirties asked was not mere equality before the law .

		He asked to be given a preference over property .

		Instead of an education vouchsafed only to the children of those who could afford it , he asked that the owners of property be required to pay for the education of children whose parents could not afford it .

		Instead of being compelled like owners of property to pay his debts , he asked to be exempted from the sacred obligation of contracts .

		Instead of equality with other creditors he asked that wages take precedence of all other forms of debt . ''

		These demands have long since been granted , and they are now so commonly defended on broad social and political grounds that it almost surprises us to learn that they ever constituted 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, the programme of a single class in the commu - nity .

		Yet at the time these demands were made by the laborers they were firmly resisted by the propertied classes ; nor was the opposition entirely lacking in logic .

		`` One of the chief incitements to industry among -LSB- the working -RSB- classes , '' says an editor of that period . ''

		is the hope of earning the means of educating their children respectably or liberally . ''

		Free public schools , it was thought , would remove this incentive to labor .

		Absurd as this argu - ment may seem to-day , it is probably as strong as those commonly put forth against the eight - hour working day , or against old-age pensions .

		The movement for a shorter working day had its origin with the development of the factory system , and it soon became the principal demand of organized labor in the thirties .

		Throughout the century it was probably the most persistent demand made by the laboring classes , and it seemed to be logically accompanied by the de - mands for free schools and the extension of manhood suffrage .

		Although the trade-union movement of the thirties did not result in the growth of national trade-unions , it did lead to local federations of them .

		Precursors of the modern central labor - unions are found in all the important cities of the period , and these city federations created a strong feeling of solidarity among the workers , unskilled as well as skilled .

		Nor was the feel - ing of sympathy and the desire for cooper - ation limited to the workers of a given locality .

		In
1834	DATE	a
National Trades ' Union Convention	ORGANIZATION	, made up of delegates from the various city federations , was held in
New York	LOCATION	, and annual conventions were held thereafter for a period of four years .

		Prison labor , cooperation , a shorter working day , female labor , and education , were the principal themes of discussion at these con - ventions .

		The movement for a shorter working day received the support of many persons out - side of the laboring classes , and it made rapid progress after
1835	DATE	.

		The organized labor movement of the thirties almost entirely disappeared during the business depression following the crisis of
1837	DATE	.

		Nothing very much like this spontaneous uprising and organization of the laboring classes appeared again until just before the outbreak of the Civil War .

		In the mean time , the labor movement of the forties had taken the form of socialistic agita - tion and communistic experiments .

		Nowhere did the ideas of
Charles Fourier	PERSON	and
Robert Owen	PERSON	find such fertile ground as in
America	LOCATION	.


Albert Brisbane	PERSON	introduced Fourierism into the
United States	LOCATION	; but Professor Commons finds the chief propagandist of this and other `` isms '' to have been
Horace Greeley	PERSON	.

		Greeley was by training and by his natural sympathies a true exponent of radical democracy , and his advocacy in the '' Tribune '' of the Utopian type of socialism did more than anything else to secure converts for the movement .

		Professor Commons is of the opinion that
Greeley	PERSON	's strong advocacy of protectionism was due to his desire to aid the wage-earner .

		His doctrine was therefore not that of class consciousness , as is that of the modern political socialist .

		Brook Farm , and most of the other associa - tions which were started under the inspiration of this Utopian movement , failed before the end of the forties , and their place was taken by the movement to secure equal rights in landed property , which was fathered by
George Henry Evans	PERSON	, but received
Greeley	ORGANIZATION	's support also .

		By inducing workingmen to go West and take up land , it was believed that the wages of those who remained in the East would be raised while at the same time rents would be reduced .

		Another movement which made great pro- gress between
1840	DATE	and
1860	DATE	, and which was inspired by English success , was that of cooper - ation .

		Although this movement had the sym - pathetic support of the intellectuals and the land-reformers , it was distinctly a working - class movement .

		Much was expected of this reform movement ; but although some tempor - ary successes were gained in
New York	LOCATION	and in
New England	LOCATION	, on the whole the results were disappointing , and the movement was short - lived .

		In the fifties , the workers once more turned their attention to trade-unionism .

		The majority of wage-earners seem to have accepted the belief that they were wage-earners for life , and that their hope of bettering their condition lay in the frank acceptance of this situation and in a concerted movement to raise the wages and the standards of living of wage-earners generally .

		Again do we witness the agitation for the shorter working-day .

		President
Van Buren	PERSON	's order , issued in
1840	DATE	, which made ten hours the length of the work-day for all government employees , was followed by an agitation to secure legisla - tion by the States fixing ten hours as the length of the working-day for all employees in privately - owned as well as in public establishments .

		At first , even the employees believed that the reduc - tion of working hours would reduce production .

		Where machinery was used , less labor would be
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 required , it was said , and higher wages would have to be paid .

		It was not until after the Civil War that
Ira Steward	ORGANIZATION	gave expression to the modern doctrine on which the demand for the shorter working-day is based . ''

		Men who labor excessively are robbed of all ambi - tion to ask for anything more than will satisfy their bodily necessities ; while those who labor moderately have time to cultivate tastes and create wants in addi - tion to more physical comforts . ''

		The revival of the trade-union movement in the later forties and early fifties resulted in the establishment of several of the national trade - unions which are still in existence .

		Many more were added in the sixties and seventies .

		The new unions did not concern themselves much with cooperation or socialistic agitation , but set themselves the task of raising wages and of secur - ing a part of the prosperity which came to the country in the wake of the
California	LOCATION	and Aus - tralian gold discoveries .

		Labor papers made their appearance in many cities , and the new unions made great use of the strike and the boy - cott to accomplish their ends .

		The city federa - tions of the unions reappeared as a factor in the situation , and there soon began a movement to secure a national federation of the workers .

		The first efforts proved unsuccessful , but in
1866	DATE	the
National Labor Union	ORGANIZATION	was formed , and for six years it represented in an influential way the interests of organized labor throughout the country .

		The
National Labor Union	ORGANIZATION	started out with its principal object to secure the eight - hour day .

		It soon became involved in issues which lay outside the fields of labor interests , particularly greenbackism and woman 's suf - frage .

		The organization finally decided to enter politics ; and here it was quickly made the tool of practical politicians .

		This ended its career .

		The decade which began with 1870 will doubtless be known as a period characterized by the growth of secret orders .

		Some of these , like the
Molly Maguires	PERSON	and the
Ku-Klux Klan	PERSON	, were of an illegal sort .

		Others kept generally within the law , and exercised great influence .

		Such were the Patrons of Husbandry -LRB- more com - monly known as the Grange -RRB- , the Sovereigns of Industry , and the Knights of Industry .

		Only the two last named were distinctly labor organizations , although in the early days of these orders many laborers belonged to the Grange , and many who did not labor with their hands were members of the
Knights of Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		So long as the Knights remained a secret society , it was viewed with much suspicion by those out - side the order ; and little was known as to its policies or its membership until
1878	DATE	, when it abandoned its policy of secrecy .

		With the beginnings of the Knights of Labor and of the
Patrons of Husbandry	ORGANIZATION	, the `` Documentary History of American Industrial Society '' comes to an abrupt close .

		The frag - mentary sketch of the labor-movement which we have just given may afford the reader some idea of the scope of the last six volumes of the work .

		Of the contents of the hundreds of documents which Professor Commons and his colleagues have reprinted , this review can of course give little idea .

		They include hitherto unprinted extracts from the records of labor organizations which are now extinct , clippings from labor periodicals and pamphlets , extracts from the minutes of various conventions , and other material from out-of-the-way sources .

		In some of the volumes are to be found excellent introductions by the editors , which aid the reader to interpret the documents .

		It is a matter of regret that not all parts of the work have been thus interpreted .

		The final volume of the series contains a splendid index and finding-list of the sources .

		The editors are to be congratulated on the completion of the work , the publishers on the way in which the material has been dressed , and the public on the wealth of documentary material which has for the first time been made easily accessible to the student .

		RECORDS OF AX OLD VILLAGE PARISH .

		The Parish Chest in the Vestry , '' says Dr.
Ditchfield	PERSON	, in his exceedingly interesting book on English Villages , `` usually contains many documents which are of profound interest to the student of village antiquities .

		It contains the old church wardens ' account-books , the parish registers , lists of briefs , and often many other papers and records which bear on the history of the parish .

		The old register books record the names of past generations of villagers , and many curious facts about the parish and its peo - ple which are not found in the dull dry columns of our modern books . ''

		We have nothing in this country which in historic interest exactly corre - sponds with the average English village or the English parish .

Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	,
N. Y. : F. B. Howard	PERSON	.

		342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, the parish chest exists it is of very rare occur - rence in the older towns of the
Atlantic Coast	LOCATION	.

		What Ditchfield refers to as the receptacle for valuable historical data may never have existed in the
Hudson River	LOCATION	town of
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	, but the historical treasures which such a chest might be expected to yield up are still extant in suffic - ient number to provide material for a history of
Christ Church Parish	ORGANIZATION	from the year
1756	DATE	down to a recent date .

		And in collating and transcrib - ing and preparing for publication the earlier documents , the accomplished editor has not only produced a parish history which might well serve as a model for others who essay so difficult a task , but she has made a valuable contribution to the economic history of the older portion of our country and to the religious history of
America	LOCATION	.

		It is a parish history , hence a large amount of space in the sumptuous volume of 425 pages is allotted to matters of purely local interest .

		Yet in the numerous lists of those who have been subscribers or members at various times , there appear names of families and of persons of na - tional or even world - wide fame .

		The history begins with an account of a missionary journey into
Dutchess County	LOCATION	, made in
1755	DATE	by the Rev.
Samuel Seabury	PERSON	, Rector of
St. George 's Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Hempstead	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		His report to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel -LRB- the venerable
S. P. G.	PERSON	-RRB- of his visit to
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	aroused someone to publish a pamphlet , to which
Seabury	ORGANIZATION	replied in another pamphlet all of which was characteristic of the times .

		Seabury made further visits , and was succeeded by a missionary sent out by the
S. P. G.	PERSON	to reside in
Dutchess County	LOCATION	and minister to the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	people of
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	and
Fishkill	LOCATION	.

		For this clergyman a glebe was purchased in
1767	DATE	.

		Thus began an alliance between the church people of
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	and
Fishkill	LOCATION	which continued , not without mutual inconven - ience and some litigation , until
1809	DATE	.

		In the colonial , the revolutionary , and post-revolution - ary periods , the records of the parish throw con - siderable side-light upon the economic conditions of those times .

		The account books show that the surplice -LRB- '' surplus , '' '' supplus , '' or '' sur - plush '' -RRB- , used by the busy missionary in charge of
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, was laundered but once a year ; that a Chippendale card-table served as an altar in the first church edifice ; that the parish purchased a `` Tickett in the King 's Bridge Lot - tery '' ; and , most curious of all , that the parish became involved in the ownership of a slave , '' a neagro man
Jack	PERSON	, '' who was taken by one of the vestrymen in part payment of the rent of the glebe in
1783	DATE	, who ran away to
Bennington	LOCATION	in the '' New Clames '' -LRB-
Vermont	LOCATION	-RRB- , was '' gilty of steeling a hors , '' was cast into jail in
New York	LOCATION	, and altogether involved his new owner in an expense of twenty pounds , and was finally sold in
Carolina	LOCATION	at a loss of another twenty pounds .

		The vestryman makes a claim upon the parish for one-half his losses in the transaction .

		Other documents relate to the action taken by the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	against the incum - bent of the parish as a Tory ; to the complica - tions arising in regard to the possession of the glebe ; and to the case of the clergyman called from
Connecticut	LOCATION	in
1784	DATE	, whose coming was delayed for three years because of debts owing in
New York City	LOCATION	, which made him liable to arrest and imprisonment if he came to reside within the state .

		In the subsequent period , while the parish reflects less of the social con - ditions , it yet catches reflections of the history of the Episcopal Church ; and the editor 's suc - cinct statements of the rise and meaning of the various parties and schools of thought within the church , and of their influence upon the life of the parish of which she is writing , serve to accomplish her avowed purpose of making the history of the church of interest to the average layman .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Pedagogy has been hard hit of late , and the blows have .

		fallen g enerall y enough to include , if not to concen - trate upon , the advocates of child-study and of the interpretation of development as the clue to the goals and methods of training .

		Professor
Kirkpat	PERSON	- rick 's volume on `` The Individual in the Making '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- falls distinctly within the assailed terri - tory .

		Yet the criticism , however severe , was not indiscriminate ; and a discriminating j udgment would leave room for tasks undertaken with a modest spirit of their limitations .

		This volume presents in an analytical temper the several periods of the child , the youth , and the man , and gives them a psycholog - ical and sociological interpretation .

		It then applies the leading results toward the shaping of an instru - ment that will help to mould character , and towards the determination of a goal that will help to guide endeavor .

		Though by no means superficial since the author has done wisely to give himself space enough to set his topics in a suggestive medium of illustration the conclusions remain on that general level of acceptability and plausibility which prevents them from making any more notable impression or attaining any more important position .

		There has been over-much literature of this kind , and some of

		THE DIAL 343 the feeble attitudes represented by it are reflected in the make-up of this book .

		Yet , placed in its class , it unquestionably stands high .

		Considering those to whom it is addressed , it will likewise be a useful book .

		It will coordinate thinking , and will assimilate views and attitudes on the part of those whose ap - proach to applied psychology is through the accred - ited channels of education .

		The book is not , and is not intended to be , inspirational , but informational .

		The fact that this type of information is subject to abuse in inviting shallow generalization must not unduly prejudice one against it .

		Mrs.
John Lane	PERSON	, in her `` Talk of the the sort of bright and agreeable comment and criticism and suggestion that made her eailier volume , `` The Champagne Standard , '' so favorably known to a wide circle of readers .

		The subject of her very first chapter , '' The Tyranny of Clothes , '' offers abundant opportunity , which is em - braced with alacrity , for the display of wit and sar - casm , and also for indulgence in exaggeration , which both here and elsewhere in the book she freely allows herself , not without effect , in a rhetorical sense .

		For example , she says : ``
Columbus	LOCATION	discov - ered
America	LOCATION	, but the Americans discovered the straw hat .

		It is a question which discovery has been of the most vital importance . ''

		-LRB- Why , by the way , do so many present-day English authors deny themselves the use of the comparative degree ? -RRB-

		And again , referring to the careless carrying of umbrellas , in a chapter on `` The Minor Crimes , '' she asserts that '' more harm is done by umbrellas poking and maiming mankind than by the deadliest ammunition known in warfare . ''

		This playful hyper - bole is sprightly , and , for a time , amusing ; but its repeated and excessive use tends to weariness .

		However , much can be forgiven an English author so friendly and appreciative in her comments on persons and things American .

		``
England	LOCATION	has no idea , '' she declares , '' what good stock she lost when she lost her New Englanders . ''

		As amusing as '' Denry the Auda - audacious .

		cious , '' and even more interesting to those who like to read about the vicissitudes of a literary calling , is Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's frankly autobiographical narrative , `` The Truth about an Author , '' which now first appears in an American edition , from the house of
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ruthless realism of the life of letters as he sees it is presented in a series of chapters de - scribing the author 's ten years ' apprenticeship to and rapid mastery of journalism , editorship , dra - matic and literary criticism , play-writing , story - writing , and novel-writing .

		It is the commercial side of it all that chiefly exhibits itself in its dissillu - sioning and seamy aspect to the reader , who , if he pinned his faith exclusively on Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, would close the book in the conviction that literary suc - cess is wholly a matter of boldness , bluff , self - confidence , shrewdness , a knack of verbal expres - sion , and an eye single to the main chance .

		A hard , glittering world , with everything appraised in terms of pounds , shillings , and pence , is the world of this commercially successful
Jack	PERSON	of all literary trades .

		Amazingly alert , intensely high-strung , brilliantly versatile , a total stranger to doubt or timidity , and an artist to his fingers ' tips , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has gone far in the path he has broken for himself , and is likely to go still further . ''

		The Truth about an Author '' is as strikingly original , with all its osten - sible faithfulness to facts , as anything its author has yet produced .

		& Co - -RRB- cen tres about two episodes of the great Frenchman 's career , one which scandalized the friends of the Church and another which scandal - ized her enemies .

		The first was the marriage of the ex-bishop to an adventuress , and the second was his surrender to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in the hour of death .

		The marriage caused scandal only in part because the career of Mme. Grand had been unusually spectac - ular , and mainly because
Talleyrand	LOCATION	had not been released from his vows , although he had been restored to the lay communion .

		He afterwards accounted for the act , in reply to questions of the
Duchesse de Dino	ORGANIZATION	, by the remark : '' I really can not give you a sufficient explanation ; it happened at a time of general disorder , when nothing seemed of much importance , neither oneself nor others . ''

		The First Consul practically forced the marriage upon
Talleyrand	LOCATION	in order to terminate a still more scandal - ous phase of the affair ; but he never relished the appearance of Mme.
Talleyrand	LOCATION	at the Tuileries .

		M. de
Lacombe	PERSON	tells the story that upon her first appearance after her marriage General
Bonaparte	PERSON	said to her , `` I hope the good conduct of the
Citoyenne Talleyrand	ORGANIZATION	will cause the levity of Mme. Grand to be forgotten . ''

		Although the lady had a reputation for being stupid , her reply was pertinent : '' On that point I can not do better than follow the example of
Citoyenne Bonaparte	PERSON	. ''

		The marriage proved to be an unendurable burden to
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, and separation followed long before the close of the imperial period .

		But the princess lived until
1835	DATE	, within three years of
Tallyrand	ORGANIZATION	's own death .

		Her death relieved him in several ways , and removed the principal obstacle to a reconciliation with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The little coterie of eighteenth-century Voltairians who still survived were indignant at the possibility of this reconciliation , which seemed to them a betrayal of the principles of the Revolution .

		A curious psychological interest attaches to the tact - ful campaign conducted for months by his nearest friends , especially the
Duchesse de Dino	PERSON	, her daughter
Pauline	PERSON	, still a mere girl , and the Abbs ' Dupanloup , to bring him to the point of signing an acceptable retraction of his errors .

		He had been gradually approaching the final step for months , but postponed affixing his signature to the necessary 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, document until the very morning of his death .

		M. de
Lacombe	PERSON	's attitude toward
Talleyrand	LOCATION	's career and conduct is indulgent .

		In touching upon dubious incidents , he discreetly avoids details .

		Upon
Talley	PERSON	- rand 's stay in
America	LOCATION	he has two pleasant chapters , which do not leave the impression that
Talleyrand	LOCATION	felt bitter toward the Americans , although the Duchesse de
Dino years later	DATE	recalls caustic remarks about them .

		The portion of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	's career prior to
1792	DATE
M. de Lacombe	ORGANIZATION	has treated in a pre - vious volume , with the title ``
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, e 've ` que d' Autun . ''

		A vast amount of research has en - tered in .

		to the makin s of Mr - F - J -
Snell	PERSON	's illustrated account of '' The Customs of Old England '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Drawing freely upon the works of other antiquaries , and supplementing these data with the results of his own studies , he has produced a score -LRB- less one -RRB- of chap - ters dealing successively with ecclesiastical , aca - demic , judicial , urban , rural , and domestic customs .

		A few pages are devoted to the library bequeathed in
1327	DATE	to
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	by
Thomas Cobham	PERSON	, Bishop of
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		`` The librarian , '' we are told , '' was granted a month 's vacation and the lib - rary was closed on
Sundays	DATE	and holy-days , unless it should chance that a distinguished stranger desired to visit it , when leave was given him from sunrise to sunset , subject to the condition that he was not followed by a loud rabble . ''

		The ordinary open hours were from nine to eleven in the
morning	TIME	, and from one to four in the afternoon .

		The catalogue took the form of a large board hung on the wall and inscribed with the names of both the books and their donors , '' lest oblivion , the step-mother of memory , should pluck from our breasts the remem - brance of our benefactors . ''

		Seventeen curious illus - trations , chiefly from old manuscripts , give diversity to the book 's contents .

		For information and sug - gestive hints the scholarly author ranges from the learned pages of `` Archaeologia , '' '' The Archaeolog - ical Journal , '' `` The Antiquary , '' and Mr.
E. F. Henderson	PERSON	's `` Select Documents of the Middle Ages , '' to the fascinating scenes of the
Waverley Novels	ORGANIZATION	, but with due note of warning where imagi - nation rather than attested fact is placed under contribution .

		A good index closes the book .


Margaret Fuller	PERSON	Mr *
Frederick Augustus Braun	PERSON	's o * a follower book entitled ''
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	and of Goethe .

		Goethe '' -LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is brought out as a centenary tribute to the most striking personality among the literary women of
America	LOCATION	.

		It has been customary to regard
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	as a Transcendentalist : here she is portrayed in quite a different light .

		As a follower of Goethe she is distinguished from the Transcendentalists as being , for instance , more human , more truly aesthetic , more practical , less Puritanic , less religious in the doctrinal sense , less visionary .

		She had little sym - pathy with the idea of the constant struggle between spirit and flesh so tremblingly cherished by the
Puri	PERSON	- tans : the belief of Goethe that '' the human instincts are what the individual must ultimately turn to for the highest laws of his inner being '' is said better to express her view .

		In this she differed from the Transcendentalists .

		In aesthetics she is recorded as notably dissident .

		The Transcendentalists '' never had , nor could they have , a true appreciation of aesthetic beauty in the Goethe-Schiller sense ...
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, on the other hand , had imbibed too deeply from the rejuvenating fountain of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry and thought to be enticed into the caves of Transcendental mysticism , or upon the frosty heights of an imagined spirituality .

		It was on this funda - mental Goethean principle that she differed from all the Transcendentalists . ''

		The portrayal of Mar - garet Fuller as a Goethean , and not a Ti'anscen - dentalist , is the most important point advanced in the book .

		We would add one or two qualifying considerations .

		The attitude of the writer is rather that of the advocate than the judge .

		A warm ad - mirer of his heroine and his hero , and with unim - peachable evidence of the admiration of the one for the other , he is too chary of admitting other evi - dence of other literary loves of the heroine , and of chronicling such changes in her devotion to Goethe as he acknowledges there were .

		Again , in claiming ''
Margaret	PERSON	'' as a disciple of Goethe , he shows scant sympathy for what might be called the opposition camp the Transcendentalists .

		The fact that in spite of her hero-worship ,
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	never lost her independence of spirit , is one to be noted before agreeing to accept her as a member of any one school .

		She walked according to her own nature , and led others among them her husband ; and she was unsubdued in death .

		Dr.
Braun	PERSON	's book indicates clearly , however , that her indebtedness to Goethe has previously been too little recognized .

		In bringing this to mind , and in giving us a new view of a nota - ble figure , the writer has rendered a service to stu - dents of our life and literature .

Europe	LOCATION	and the nearer East cover the itineraries described ; but even in these unremote regions the difficulties and vexations of travel were formidable enough in
1600	DATE	to make one glad to make no nearer acquaintance with them than through the pleasant pages of Mr.
Bates	PERSON	's book .

		Imagine the horrors of a sea-voyage which is thus described by one of the voyagers : `` In the galley all sorts of discomfort are met
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 with : to each of us was allotted a space three spans broad , and so we lay one upon another , suffering greatly from the heat in
summer	DATE	and much troubled by vermin .

		Huge rats came running over our faces at nights , and a sharp eye had to be kept on the torches , for some people go about carelessly and there 's no putting them out in case of tire , being , as they are , all pitch . ''

		And when the port was reached , what indescribably wretched inns received the travellers !

		A German tourist in
Spain	LOCATION	speaks of a Castilian tavern where the stable , the bedroom , the kitchen , the dining-room , and the pigstye are one , and even a papal envoy is obliged to sleep on straw in a wintry night with no fire .

		Numerous illustra - tions from old prints help to confirm these tales of almost incredible hardship in travel , while they also amuse the reader with their crudity of design and rudeness of execution .

		A bibliography and an index complete the work , which contains as much of diver - sion and information as one could reasonably desire .

		The
Young Turks	ORGANIZATION	, R ecent ^ events in
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and problems of lands give a peculiar timeliness to the near
East	LOCATION	.

		Mr .

		H
Charles Woods	PERSON	's careful first-hand study of '' The Danger Zone of
Europe	LOCATION	: Changes and Problems in the Near East '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


Tripoli	LOCATION	, it is true , has no place in the book 's contents ; but a long chapter on the Turkish army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, and another on the new regime that sprang into being a little more than
three years ago	DATE	, gain especial interest from the present Turko-Italian difficulty .

		Other chapters treat of the Albanian question , the Cretan question , the independence of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, the position of
Servia	LOCATION	,
Montenegro	LOCATION	, and
Bosnia	LOCATION	, Greek military and naval matters ,
Asia	LOCATION	Minor , and the Armenian massacres of two years and a half ago .

		To this latter subject three considerable chapters are devoted , in an earn - est attempt to arrive at causes and to state results .

		Not all the blame is laid by the author on the Turks ; he believes that '' the massacres were prob - ably remotely caused by the talk of equality which roused the Moslems to a state of fury , by the ex - treme orators of both religions , by the somewhat foolish actions of a very small section of the
Armen	PERSON	- ian community , and by the feebleness and negli - gence of the governmental officials in the localities in which the massacres actually occurred . ''

		Two extended tours through the '' danger zone '' have placed Mr.
Woods	PERSON	in a position to speak with the authority of an eye-witness , and his report of things seen and heard was well worth printing .

		With its many views and portraits the book is of most invit - ing appearance .

		Vacationing in
Lower Normandy	LOCATION	is the theme of '' .

		The Belmont Book '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , by a literary woman whose home for years has been in
Paris	LOCATION	, who writes novels , who chooses in this instance the pseudonym `` Vados '' but is addressed by the characters of her book as Madame Van burgh , and who is vouched for by no less an authority than Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	in an eminently characteristic seven-page Introduction .

		Belmont is of course not the real name of the se - cluded hamlet whose peasant folk and simple cus - toms and rustic festivals are idealized and bathed in an atmosphere of something like enchantment by the author of '' The Belmont Book . ''

		But the name signifies nothing : the pretty Norman hamlet would be made by `` Vados '' to smell as sweet by any other .

		As a sample of the book 's quality a passage from a peasant banquet scene in the chapter entitled `` Harvest '' may be given . ''

		Lamy folded back his shirt-sleeves and proceeded to carve the birds .

		It is not easy to distribute two chickens among four - teen persons so that each has a satisfactory portion , but he managed very adroitly ; if the helpings were small , there was plenty of lettuce and mountains of mashed potatoes . ''

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's Intro - duction , beginning , `` I quite meant to write this book myself , '' and continuing with no distressing bashfulness about the use of the first personal pro- noun , and with a sufficiency of short , positively as - sertive , sometimes would-be startling utterances , in the manner at present affected by sundry English writers , is not the least striking feature of the book , whose pages gain attractiveness also from the fre - quent bits of French verse pertinently quoted , and from the abundance of dialogue throughout .

		Passing their honeymoon on a half - .

		million-dollar steam yacht would probably bring far less of keen enjoy - ment to the honeymooners than did the wedding journey in a `` shanty-boat '' procure for Mr.
John L. Mathews	PERSON	and his blushing bride .

		Not that we are told of her blushing , but at any rate we do learn in '' The Log of the Easy Way '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is both written and photographically illustrated by the bridegroom , that not only the first month of wedded happiness , but also three or four more , were most agreeably spent in floating down the
Illinois	LOCATION	and
Mississippi	LOCATION	rivers in a hundred-dollar house-boat to
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		To be exact , it was on the unromantic waters of the
Chicago Drainage Canal	ORGANIZATION	that the little craft was launched ; and there the adventurous couple , on the afternoon of their marriage , started on their river-voyage and their life-voyage together .

		The modest expenses of this fluvial wedding-tour were easily paid out of the returns from newspaper stories and correspondence executed on the way .

		It is evident that
Mark Twain	PERSON	's `` Life on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	'' has by no means exhausted the fruitful theme of Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	's nar - rative .

		Fortunate in the choice of his mate , who was as fond of roughing it as himself , the captain of the '' Easy Way '' has none but wholesome and enjoy - able experiences to relate , even though the inevitable mishaps and delays and disappointments did include themselves in the things to be recorded .

		There was plenty of sight-seeing on land as well as lazy drifting with the current , and the book suffers from no lack of variety in its contents .

		346 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, , .

		The Rev.
Frank Crane	PERSON	's volume of -LRB- hose who can '' Human Confessions '' -LRB-
Forbes &	ORGANIZATION	read and run .

		Q O -RRB- conforms to a type which mod - ern journalism has imposed upon literary ideals .

		The author assumes that important topics may be suggestively disposed of within a limited frame of two pages .

		To characterize the result , one might in the same vein invent the phrase of '' Glimpses of Life from a Moralizing Car - Window , '' or speak of each essay as a sentimental u rhapsodette . ''

		Given a mind that is independent if not original and takes its views by flashes , the result must at times be sug gestive , and often stimulating .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	in so far accomplishes his purpose .

		It is difficult to touch upon an attitude that binds these beads of impres - sions into a chain ; but a strand that appears and reappears is , in his own language , a conviction that there is no `` Preferred stock '' in the intellectual life , and that '' the Common stock '' carries the best values .

		This philanthropic fallacy is in turn due to a rather assertative type of human sympathy that , in its desire to make ways smooth and to encourage the despondent , blinds itself and loses the larger outlook and the higher opportunity .

		Yet this is preeminently the field of individual temperament and insight .

		Doubtless this type of essay makes its appeal to those who wish to read and be impressed as they run .

		The second biography of the Great ?


$ %	PERCENT	?

		** Empress Dowager of
China	LOCATION	to be issued within the year comes from the facile pen of Mr.
Philip W. Sargeant	PERSON	, former editor of the Hongkong '' Daily Press . ''

		The ma - terial for a fair and exhaustive story of
China	LOCATION	's Old Buddha is not yet available for western scholars ; perhaps it may never be , for little is really known of her career before
1898	DATE	, and much remains to be learned of her conduct since that time .

		Mr.
Sar	PERSON	- geant 's account , which might properly be called a sketch of
China	LOCATION	's relations with the powers since
1834	DATE	, is marked by a keen appreciation of the Chinese point of view in the many difficulties in which the Empire was involved : the foreign wars , the missionary question , the demands for conces - sions , the Boxer rising .

		And for the Empress her - self he evinces a high admiration , unwilling as he is to attempt '' to indicate definitely which way the verdict on her character ought to go . ''

		Acceptable as is the volume for its general tone of fairness and its interesting style , yet it must suffer in comparison with ''
China	LOCATION	under the Empress Dowager , '' which covers the same ground , and which , because of its use of Chinese sources , added largely to the knowl - edge possessed by westerners concerning this un - questionably great character .

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,

		must s h ow 8ome resu l t j n dollars and cents or something equally material , Mr.
William Wallace Tooker	PERSON	's work on '' Indian Place - Names on
Long Island	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- will not appeal .

		Indian namet of placet on
Long Itland	LOCATION	.

		But , fortunately , there are others who can find a real value in a work of this kind .

		The volume contains detailed studies of nearly 500 Algonkin names of places on
Long Island	LOCATION	and adjacent islands ; a list of Algonkin names suitable for country homes , clubs , etc. ; and extensive bibliographies of contri - butions to the study of Indian nomenclature .

		- An examination of the work proves that it has value , not only because it contains much interesting informa - tion , but because it furnishes a historical background for the study of a modern community , explains the origin of numerous additions to the dictionary , and throws a light on the methods and results of race - contact when the English and the Indians came together in early colonial history .

		The conditions of this contact are not always well understood by the historians of later days ; and any study which , like this one , helps to an understanding of primitive
America	LOCATION	, should be welcome .

		One thing is very clear to the layman who examines the list of Algonkin words , and that is that the place-names of the South - ern and Western Indians are much more euphonious than those of the North-east .

		Compare , for example , Jiskhampog with
Notasulga	LOCATION	, or Wussoquatomiset with
Opelousas	LOCATION	.

		_ The sixth and last lume of
Scrib	LOCATION	- The smallest of the republic * of ner 's '' South American Series '' is on
South America	LOCATION	.


Uruguay	LOCATION	, the smallest of the South American countries .

		The author is
W. H. Koebel	PERSON	, who is already known to students of South American history as the author of two books on
Argentina	LOCATION	.

		Like Mr.
Koebel	PERSON	's other books , this one is very com - prehensive in its contents .

		He endeavors to present in outline a description of everything of interest re - lating to the country .

		He takes up , therefore , for detailed treatment the physiography of the country , the population , history , and politics , the makers of history and directors of politics , the government , foreign interests and influence , manners and cus - toms , industries , trade , city life and ranch life , and natural resources .

		The volume is well printed and well illustrated , and the style is better than that of Mr.
Koebel	PERSON	's books on
Argentina	LOCATION	.

		The work is especially valuable as the only adequate English ac - count of
Uruguay	LOCATION	.

		_
Horace '	PERSON	, letters
Horace	PERSON	at his best , in the mellow modernized and maturity of his fifth decade , is the paraphrased .

		Horace of theEpistles .

		Their shrewd - ness and geniality make these familiar letters agree - able reading for all time , despite their homiletic tone and not infrequent platitude .

		Fifteen of the twenty-three Epistles have been freely rendered , or paraphrased , and provided with an Introduction and explanatory notes , and with illustrations and two sketch maps , by Mr.
Charles Loomis Dana	PERSON	and Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	.

		When it is added that the
Elm-Tree Press	ORGANIZATION	, of
Woodstock	LOCATION	,

Horace	PERSON	for Modern Readers , '' and that excellent reproductions of some of
Van Veen	ORGANIZATION	's illustrations , and also of photographs taken espe - cially for the work , embellish the volume , some con -

		THE DIAL 347 ception can be formed of its artistic appearance .

		To render more attractive to the modern reader these selections from letters written nearly two thousand years ago , the translators have not shrunk from omis - sions and amplifications .

		It is a little surprising that in their choice of the more interesting and suitable letters they have omitted the short and excellent eleventh of the first book , '' Ad Bullatium , '' which contains that oft-quoted line , '' Ccelum , non animum mutant , qui trans mare currunt . ''

		The purpose of the book , however , seems in general to have been admirably attained .

		The edition is limited to five hundred copies .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		La Lyre d' Amour , '' edited by Mr.
Charles B. Lewis	PERSON	, is an anthology of French love poems published by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It devotes much of its space to the earlier periods , and , in fact , comes down no further than
1866	DATE	, this limitation resulting from the impossibility of getting permission to reproduce the copyrighted poems of certain modern authors .

		The Oxford Book of English Verse '' is the model upon which Sir
George Douglas	PERSON	has prepared , and the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published , '' The Book of
Scot	PERSON	- tish Poetry , '' a handsome volume of nine hundred pages .

		The best critical texts have been followed , and the con - tents bring the exhibition down to the present time , in - cluding such writers as
John Davidson	PERSON	and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	to say nothing of the youngsters .

		Professor H
C. Nutting	PERSON	has prepared for the Ameri - can
Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' A Latin Primer '' which should do much to encourage the beginning of the study in grades below the high school .

		It is given not a little of human inter - est , partly by pictures , and partly by the introduction of interesting material and colloquial phrasing .

		The work will presently be followed by a '' First Latin Reader '' in continuance of the plan upon which the primer is based .

		Translations of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	are less frequent now than they used to be , and Mr.
C. E. Wheeler	PERSON	's new version of the entire `` Divine Comedy '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- brings with it some - thing like a sense of novelty .

		It is a dignified and painstaking version in terza rima , which will compare favorably with the best of previous experiments in this measure .

		The '' Temple '' notes are borrowed almost bodily by Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	, who also admits a considerable amount of indebtedness to the '' Temple '' version .

		The work is published in three volumes .

		We must say once more of '' The Statesman 's Year Book '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , upon the present occasion of its forty-eighth annual publication , that it belongs to the class of absolutely indispensable books of reference .

		It is still edited by Mr.
J. Scott Keltic	PERSON	, who notes with regret the death of Mr.
I. P. A. Renwick	PERSON	, his collabor - ator in the work for something like a score of years .

		The United States Census Statistics for
1910	DATE	are intro - duced as far as they are yet available .

		The volume fills nearly fifteen hundred pages .

		Mr.
Clinton Rogers Woodruff	PERSON	is editing a series of books for the
National Municipal League	ORGANIZATION	, in which has just appeared a volume on '' City Government by Com - mission '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It gives the history of commis - sion government as applied to cities , an explanation of what it is , the popular arguments for and against it , and an extensive account of the results obtained in several cities , large and small , which have adopted it .

		The spread of the movement certainly has been rapid , and no city has taken a backward step .

		Two years ago only fifty cities had adopted the plan ; to-day a hundred and fifty-six are operating under this system , and over two hundred more have it under consideration .

		They will do well to get the facts from Mr.
Woodruff	PERSON	's book . ''

		The Teaching of Geometry , '' by Professor
David Eugene Smith	PERSON	, is a treatise published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its reading should be urged upon teachers of the subject , who are only too often contented with a rule-of-thumb and mechanical method of instruction .

		Geometry is really a fascinating study , viewed in the light of its history and through philosophical spectacles , but most of our students are not made to see in it any - thing more than a dry and disagreeable task .

		A book like this will be found to have a surprisingly vitalizing influence upon the mind .

		One of the most successful achievements in the series of
Riverside Press Editions	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the reprint of ''
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	, '' just issued in an edition of 335 copies .

		It is a small volume of some forty pages , printed from the
Riverside Caslon	PERSON	type , with large rubricated initials at the beginnings of paragraphs .

		A feature of unusual interest is the series of borders repro - duced from
Geofroy Tory 's Book of Hours	ORGANIZATION	, published in 1524-5 .

		One of these borders surrounds each page .

		They are splendidly reproduced and printed ; and their clean-cut lines and wonderful decorative quality are a joy to the eye wearied of modern wash drawings and bizarre ornamentation .

		The old Hebrew discourse seems almost to acquire an added beauty in this new setting .

		A broad-margined limited edition of '' Letters from
Francis Parkman	PERSON	to
E. G. Squier	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.

Seitz	PERSON	, is published by the
Torch Press of Cedar Rapids	ORGANIZATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		The letters , twenty-four in number , extending from
1849	DATE	to
1870	DATE	, with two wide gaps of silence , ex - hibit the young historian entering upon and carrying forward his great historical work under those well - known disadvantages of defective eyesight and trouble - some head that made the completion of his task a tri - umph of will-power no less than of scholarship . ''

		My eyes I do n't mind , '' he courageously asserts in
1849	DATE	. ''

		I can get along without them ; but to have one 's brains stirred up in a mush , may be regarded as a de - cided obstacle in the way of intellectual achievements .

		Give me the tithe of a chance and I will do it . ''

		The letters are pleasantly intimate as well as scholarly .

		Mr.
Edward Payson Morton	PERSON	is the author of a small treatise on '' The Technique of English Non-dramatic Blank Verse '' -LRB-
R. R. Donnelley & Sous	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- , dis - cussing the subject under the captions of Lines ,
Caesuras	LOCATION	, Feet , and Tone-Quality , with special considerations of individual poets .

		The work is based upon exhaustive tabulations of the actual practices , in the details con - sidered , of the important English poets and many early minor poets .

		From the results , general rules are laid down governing the conventions which obtain among these writers of blank verse , and ignorance of which , the author contends has vitiated many judgments which have been passed upon that form of poetic expression .

		The book is the result of an immense amount of patient and detailed labor , the steps of which are reproduced , as the author explains , not because he wishes to attach undue importance to fractional variations in the fre - quency of certain usages , but to show definitely the steps by which he reaches his results .

		The vigorous temperance tract of that veteran and tireless reformer , Rev.
Jenkin Lloyd Jones	PERSON	, '' On the Firing Line in the Battle for Sobriety , '' is now issued in a special edition for the use of libraries , preachers , teachers , etc. , to whom it will be sent on receipt of
five cents	MONEY	for cost of delivery .

fifty cents	MONEY	a copy .

		Two more important American volumes in `` The Home University Library , '' which
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish in conjunction with
Messrs. Williams & Norgate	ORGANIZATION	of

		The Vocational Guidance of Youth , '' by Mr.
Meyer Bloomfield	PERSON	, and '' Individuality , '' by Professor
Edward L. Thorndike	PERSON	, are two small books published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their series of `` Riverside Educational Monographs . ''

		Both are compact and sug - gestive treatises , which will be found well worth the attention of teachers and school administrators .

		A new idea in library-report illustration has been conceived by the new librarian of the St.

		Mr.
Charles E. Rush	PERSON	, who succeeded Mr.
Purd V. Wright	PERSON	at that important post , adorns his first annual survey of bibliothecal progress with a number of delicate fancy sketches in pen-and-ink , representing library readers and their characteristic attitudes in a vivid and amusing manner .

		The whole pamphlet breathes the freshness and hopefulness prop - erly belonging to a new administration .

		Mr.
Martin Nijhoff	PERSON	, publisher , of The Hague , an - nounces the forthcoming publication , if the number of subscribers is sufficiently large , of a volume containing hitherto unpublished letters of
John Locke	PERSON	to

		Library Bulletin No. 1 , on `` Farm Colonies , '' comes from the
New York School of Philanthropy	ORGANIZATION	, and is made up of selected titles of books and articles in the school 's library on Farm Colonies for Vagrants and Convicts .

		The list covers three double-column pages and embraces both general treatises and those pertain - ing more especially to particular countries or to States of our own country .

		These Bulletins are issued only after being submitted to experts , and are likely to prove useful and trustworthy to librarians .

		The Honorable
John Bigelow	PERSON	, in spite of his ninety - four years , is actively engaged part of each day on his '' Retrospections of an Active Life . ''

		Three volumes of this book have already been published by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A fourth volume Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	has now ready for press ; and he is working on a fifth volume , a large part of which he has already completed .

		These two later volumes will derive especial interest from dis - closures of political and diplomatic occurrences which have not been hitherto published , and will throw light on certain important developments of the past thirty years .

		Miss
Mary Antrim	PERSON	, the Polish Jewess whose graphic sketches of life in her native Polotzls have recently enlivened the pages of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' has begun in the
October	DATE	issue of that magazine some chapters of her remarkable autobiography .

		From the first instal - ment we quote a few lines to tempt the reader to make further acquaintance , if he has not yet done so , with a piquantly interesting writer . ''

Bible Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	published Ever since its first issue -LRB- in

		Notwithstanding the cheap price at which it is sold , it is so complete and full that the ordinary student needs nothing larger .

		The articles are prepared by competent scholars , and do what most of the competing dictionaries do not do give to conservative views a fair statement , while duly recognizing the attempts to unsettle confidence in Old Testament history .

		The present edition brings the volume up to date , and is enriched by a large number of new maps and illustrations made from original photographs .

		BRIEFER MENTION 401 NOTES 402 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... .403 DOGBERRY AT THE SEAT OF CUSTOM .

		For half a century , or thereabouts , as poor students have known to their sorrow , our bar - barous tariff laws have imposed a tax of twenty - five per cent upon the products of literary intelligence and learning , when those products have taken the shape of books printed in the English language within twenty years of the date of their importation .

		All protests against this ` stupid policy of discouraging education have proved unavailing in the several revisions of the tariff that have been made since the days when the Civil War compelled the taxation of everything that could be counted upon to yield revenue to a nation in desperate need .

		The need long ago disappeared , and the government coffers have been overflowing most of the time since ; but the brutal exaction has continued to be practised , to our shame as a people .

		No one has ever been able to furnish a decent argument in its defence , for even the miserable plea of the petty selfish interest whining for govern - ment bolstering breaks down in this case .

		The scholar who has to have a book will buy it even at the inflated price , thereby making his forced contribution to a treasury that has no need of his sacrifice ; he certainly will not buy a '' pro- tected '' American book in its stead , and the benefit to the native author , publisher , or printer is thus wholly illusory .

		Bureaucratic officialism , which is always on the alert to strain the tax laws in the interest of the treasury , and to subject them to forced interpretations whenever it sees an opportunity to increase the discomfort of its helpless victims , has found a fine field for its malevolent activ - ities in the tax on books .

		It achieved a signal triumph when it reduced the duty-free impor - tation of French and German books by the dis - covery that many of them contained quotations from English authors , or printed the titles of English books in their notes and bibliographies , thereby failing to meet the requirement that new books , to be untaxed , must be printed wholly in foreign languages .

		Such a preposter - ous ruling as this would seem incredible to a rational mind , but the mind which is its substi - tute in our custom-houses finds no difficulty in thus flouting the dictates of common sense , and many a student who has ordered from abroad 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the latest continental literature in his special field of investigation has had to pay dearly for the carelessness of the foreign writer in citing English authorities .

		A recent subject of adjudication by the Treas - ury
Department	ORGANIZATION	is that of the duty to be paid upon books in leather bindings .

		Until recently , a book was a book , and as such paid its twenty - five per cent ; even a book that had been sent to
Europe	LOCATION	for re binding was permitted to return as a book -LRB- with the twenty-five per cent penalty -RRB- , upon the theory that it was a book that had been repaired .

		But the discovery has now been made that a book may also be a manufacture of leather , and thus liable to a tax of forty per cent .

		This is the consequence of a `` joker '' in the Tariff Act of
1909	DATE	, where the words '' wholly or in chief value of paper '' were deftly inserted in the description of the books that were to be subject to a book-duty only .

		Like all legisla - tive `` jokers , '' this one was intended to be un - noticed at first , but afterwards revealed to the keen scent of our watch-dogs of the treasury .

		On the face of the matter , the decision which has recently confirmed an assessment of forty per cent upon an invoice of leather-bound books seems to have the law literally upon its side .

		If the leather binding of a book is the component of chief value , a literal interpretation of the words above quoted would exclude it from the benefit of the lower rate .

		A fifty-cent book in paper may easily be made a manufacture of leather having a value of five dollars .

		But there is something to be said in behalf of com - mon sense even in this case , and it is said in the dissenting opinion of General Appraiser Shar - retts , who makes use of these significant words : '' Classification dependent upon the respective values of books and their binding will result in constant litiga - tion , involving the almost hopeless task of establishing , with any degree of certainty , facts upon which to predi - cate a decision , for who is there wise enough to deter - mine the precise value of the time and labor expended by the author who prepared the matter contained in the printed paper book before it had been bound , a prequisite in the determination of which is the greater value , the paper book so prepared or the piece of leather covering it .

		... The free list of the present act treats books , bound or unbound , with the same liberality as did all former acts , and I can not believe that in the dutiable list , because these articles happen to be covered with a skiver of leather ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	intended they should be relegated to a catch-all clause and classified along with bags , baskets , belts , satchels , and other miscellaneous manufactures of leather . ''

		A second subject of contention between book importers and customs officials relates to the at - tempt of the latter to include unpaid royalties in the figure upon which duties should be assessed .

		This absurd claim , which the most fanatical ad - vocate of '' protection '' for American printers and binders would be hard pressed to justify , has happily fallen into the hands of Secretary
MacVeagh	PERSON	, who has at least swept some of the cobwebs away from the discussion , and to that extent routed the Dogberry s of the customs .

		His decision reads that the royalty '' Does not constitute a part of the cost of printing and selling the publication and does not accrue to the benefit of the vendor or shipper , but is paid to the author either in this country or abroad for the privilege of using his manuscript , and in the department 's opinion , is clearly not a part of the dutiable value of the sheets imported . ''

		One exception is made to this ruling in the case of books which are imported at a wholesale price that does not separate royalty from the other elements of cost to the foreign publisher .

		In this case it is held , unfortunately and illogically , in our opinion , that '' The wholesale price at which the same are so sold or offered for sale constitutes the foreign market value , and is therefore the dutiable value thereof regardless of the items of cost , profit , royalty , etc. , which may have been taken into consideration in fixing such price . ''

		We are sorry that the decision does not put an end once for all to the whole miserable busi - ness of taxing the English author directly .

		It is bad enough to tax him indirectly by penaliz - ing the American purchaser of his books to the extent of twenty-five -LRB- or forty -RRB- per cent upon the material cost .

		The English publisher sells a book at , say , one dollar .

		But of this sum from fifteen to
thirty cents	MONEY	comes to the publisher only as trustee ; it does not belong to him , and has absolutely nothing to do with the cost of the book in any sense with which the `` protection '' principle is concerned .

		In the final analysis , it amounts to '' protecting '' the American printer to an extent considerably beyond the twenty - five per cent of his own demand .

		This is made clear in the detailed statement of the case made last
July	DATE	by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, who has for so many years fought stoutly for decency in our treatment of English authors and publishers , and whose logic is of the unas - sailable sort that must ultimately prevail .

		A third subject of dispute , still under advise - ment , is that of the price upon which the tax should be computed in the case of special ar - rangements whereby the American publisher or bookseller takes over a part of the edition of some English work .

		In such a case the Eng - lish publisher is apt to figure rather closely , and make the sale close to the bare margin of profit , which in turn may result in a lowered retail price in the American market .

		The customs
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 officials , enraged at the idea that books should be bought for so little money , are now trying to substitute an artificial valuation -LRB- based upon the selling price in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- for the actual invoiced valuation of the books .

		The case to them illus - trates the abhorred practice of '' dumping '' in one of its most flagrant forms .

		Perhaps they may be able to carry their point in this case also , since animus rather than reason seems to be the mainspring of their actions .

		But the darkest hour is just before the dawn , and we may all awake some fine morning , and rub our startled eyes to behold the whole system and apparatus of tax - ation on books itself made the object of a most uncompromising process of '' dumping '' cast by an enlightened public conscience upon the rubbish heap or to discover it exemplifying anew
Arnold	LOCATION	's beautiful figure : '' The sun shone in the new-wash 'd sky , And what from heaven saw he ?

		Blocks of the past , like icebergs high , Float on a rolling sea ! ''

		When that glad day dawns for us , and , in the allied matter of international copyright , we take our belated stand upon the platform of the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	, we may indeed feel that we are entitled to be counted among the civil - ized nations .

		PENSIONS AND THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS .

		It is part of the undisciplined heritage which we call human nature , to assert rights strenuously and assume obligations reluctantly .

		With the growth of the altruistic spirit , which cultivates thinking in the larger terms of social benefit , the sense of public obligation is gradually and laboriously maturing .

		There is no idea that stands in greater need of this beneficent socialization than that conveyed by the term '' pension . ''

		American experience has been peculiarly unfortunate in linking the term with one of the greatest scandals of public extravagance , show - ing human quality at its worst .

		It is also unfortu - nate that the pity extended to old age and poverty and lack of thrift , has enveloped the term in an atmosphere of charity .

		Foreign examples and an attention to principles should have kept in mind the more dignified sense which the pension may carry as a recognition of merit , a badge of honor .

		It will ever be impossible , and perhaps undesirable , to separate the economic responsibility applicable to all meritorious servitors of society from the special recognition to be accorded those who might well be relieved of economic pressure , or to those who through devotion to intellectual or moral purpose have been debarred from the more lucrative pur - suits .

		The distinction is none the less to be held and clarified , despite the similar resultant expression ; moreover , the sturdy justice and even the humani - tarian sympathy that invites to the acceptance of economic responsibility is itself congenial to the senti - ment that finds a duty and a pleasure in lending honor and dignity to a pension conferred in recognition of distinguished or altruistic service .

		Our sole institution for realizing this claim to recognition of the learned classes owes its existence to the wisdom and beneficence of one man the Car - negie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present reflections are prompted by the opinions of its president , Dr.
H. S. Pritchett	PERSON	-LRB- '' Popular Sci - ence Monthly '' for
November	DATE	-RRB- , in discussion of the '' Moral Influence of a University Pension Sys - tem , '' or let us say frankly by the considerations which are conspicuously absent from his presentation .

		We stand ready to accord Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	the author - ity of judgment as to management , growing out of his official experience and accumulated wisdom ; but we can not grant him by virtue of his office any special warrant in the appraisal of wise principles which management is to follow , other than that con - ferred by the possession of insight and ideals and the personal qualities to carry them into expression .

		We are ready to accept his summary that '' the experience of the world seems to point strongly to the conclusion that on the whole a contributory form of pension is likely to be more just and least harm - ful '' ; and we can not withhold a regret that the ex - perience of the world was not available five years ago when the contrary policy was adopted by the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Let it be recognized that every pension system applicable to many and to all sorts and conditions of men presents problems of management and requires economic considerations of the greatest good or , as Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	seems to view it , the least harm of the largest number .

		The Foundation must balance its books by economic as well as by intellectual and moral standards .

		Yet fundamentally the selection of university professors of selected institutions as beneficiaries carries an honor and a privilege as well as a benefit .

		This aspect of the pension must dominate and guide the spirit of the institution as it inspired Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's deed of gift and appealed to his wisdom and phil - anthropy ; and considerations of management must on no account or pretext be permitted to disturb the trend of a far-reaching purpose , or to encroach upon the field where policy is sacred and politics profane .

		Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	's article gives the impression of an official weighed down with administrative annoy - ances , and deeply concerned to avert the impending demoralization of the professor when confronted by the remote prospect of an allowance granted without supervision or under the care of a trustee or guard - ian , if such should be granted at an age when the allowance might still be used for the advantage of his career .

		Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	's doubts extend to many distressing aspects of the professor 's character .

		Under these circumstances it would be as fair as kind that President
Pritchett	PERSON	should be relieved of the burdens of his office , which might well be placed 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, in the hands of someone more strongly convinced of the worthiness of the academic class as beneficia - ries , and more deeply interested in furthering the purposes for which the Foundation was established .

		The symptoms , we venture to diagnose , point to another case of the prevalent malady of hypertrophy of the executive centres of the spinal cord , and atrophy of the higher cerebral centres of intellectual vision and directive purpose .

		The suggestion is obvious that the malady may be of contagious origin , since the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	is made up of college presidents .

		But is it not translucently clear that this institution , of such profound significance for the academic life of the nation and of such great potentiality for intellectual interests an institution founded purely and simply for the benefit of one of the learned professions , and unhampered by fund - eating buildings , or the clamor of students , or the demands of the public , or the contentions of rivals might well serve as an exemplar by determining its measures in the larger spirit of academic welfare ?

		In benighted
Germany	LOCATION	, professors are actually sum - moned to councils of state ; in enlightened
America	LOCATION	they are not granted a single representative on the council of an institution founded exclusively for their own interests .

		The '' moral '' considerations brought to bear on the discussion of a pension system are such as these : that '' human nature in teachers and in working men is in no sense different '' ; that `` thrift is a funda - mental human virtue ... hard to build up ... easy to break down '' ; that '' profitable study and the cheerful performance of severe tasks are aided by serenity , not perplexity of mind '' ; '' that there is little danger that a pension will demoralize a man who up to sixty-five or seventy years of age has given his life to the hard and unselfish work of a teacher '' ; that '' every teacher ... thinks his own situation is unique and that he is entitled to consideration of a special sort by reason of his particular and unusual service '' ; that '' all this arises out of the qualities of human nature '' ; that '' on the whole the number of those whose selfishness is touched by such a benefit -LSB- the pension at the age of sixty-five -RSB- is small , as small as one ought to expect '' ; that '' if it be true that we are still so uncivilized that a prospect of serene and helpful old age is demoralizing to men of high intel - lectual training , then the cure for this situation does not lie in making old age uncertain and insecure , but in the gradual education of men to a better ideal of life . ''

		We have made a sincere effort to take to heart these profound , stimulating , and consoling truths , or near - truths , but have failed woefully in extracting from them a set of principles that when embodied in measures will give the largest returns to society from the partial economic relief of those whosepursuits and ability entitle them to such privilege and honor .

		We find it a little difficult to decide whether it is candor or an insensibility to inconsistency that admits that the number of those who look upon a pension system for what they can get out of it is very small , yet ap - praises the entire '' moral '' influence of a pension by the attitude of these heavily pigmented members of the flock , and shapes the measures of a great Foundation to checkmate the sinister intentions of a stray individual .

		Such is the dismal triumph of efficient administration ; and such the usual sacrifice of the higher interests of the worthier cause which is borne in silence .

		In the administrator 's heaven there is joy over one sinner who is thwarted , more than there is grief over the lost opportunities of ninety - and-nine righteous persons who need no thwarting .

		Yet let us be optimistic , if we can decently be so without becoming platitudinous or superficial .

		It fortunately remains true that one of the largest and best influences of a pension system lies in its promise of security that enables the beneficiary , be he
Justice of the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	or Professor at
Harvard	LOCATION	, to pur - sue his career with some singleness of purpose , with lessened anxiety over the depressing uncertainties of the future .

		The virtue of even a small pension lies in its security as well as in its status as an earned privilege coming to one by right and not by charity .

		Such security we attach to the institutions of law and government , and to the enduring virtues that give permanence to human ideals and their progressive embodiment ; we associate it with the stability of economically sound governments , and with the pub - lic and private vested interests that flourish under enlightened governments .

		In little things as in big ones , adherence to principle and an understanding of its vital significance tells in the long run and in the short run .

		Yet so little sense of the relation of principle to measure was shown by the Foundation that the clause relating to the widow 's benefit indi - cated that the Trustees may vote her half the allow - ance to which her husband was entitled ; and the may became a shall only through the urgency of others .

		It is not the principle of the matter , but the grateful letter of a widow receiving
fifty dollars	MONEY	a month , that impresses Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	with the redeem - ing value of a pension system .

		Gratitude is in place in any good cause , but it is well to maintain a per - spective in human relations .

		For the security of earthly benefits , one may well be grateful ; for they are subject to vicissitudes at best .

		Yet the other form of security is quite as vital and more under control : the steadfast adherence to commanding principles and the loyalty to obligation tempered by judicial wisdom .

		Two years have not been long enough to make men forget the shock occasioned by the peremptory withdrawal of one and in princi - ple the more liberal and promising of the two fun - damental provisions of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is that sort of insecurity that makes men lose their faith in even the best of men , and gives the sting to regret .

		It is that , too , that circulates disquieting rumors and makes men suspicious of proffered reasons , and spe - cious time-serving arguments , and all the subtler dis - ingenuousness not le ` ss damning than the coarser du - plicities of politics .

		We sincerely wish that in our temporary essay at optimism , we might convince Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	once for all that the
University	ORGANIZATION	pension sys -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 tern can only do good , endless good , far-reaching good in more ways than we can take space to enumerate , and induce him to dismiss his phobia of professorial demoralization and devote his talents to the study of the possibilities of liberal and unrestricted and secure provisions to further the interests of the learned pro- fessions .

		What is really demoralizing and does end - less harm is the flopping and tacking of those who set the course , the weak grasp of or adherence to un - derlying purposes as reliable and as indispensable as the compass .

		May we not moralize for his benefit , and remind him that confidence `` is a fundamental human virtue ... hard to build up ... easy to break down . ''

		We have said more of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	and less of the value of pensions for the learned pro- fessions than was our intention .

		But the concrete ever engages the attention ; and it is often the more urgent and useful measure to set right the faulty steering in the short tack of the moment on the skiff upon which we are embarked , than to chart the future course of the great ship of state that must eventually carry our ventures .

		Human highways , moreover , are not like the broad open sea ; they get clogged with tradition and littered with the debris of precedent , and the retracing of steps is often pecu - liarly troublesome .

		But the two phases of the theme are of one nature .

		It is an underlying distrust of the man of learning , the hesitant recognition of his value for the intellectual resources of the nation , that makes public interests dilatory in providing such honorable recognition as the pension stands for , and as well leads to weak and floundering con - sideration and operation of the measures adopted .

		Born of the same feeble confidence is the emphasis placed upon administrative restrictions and the exal - tation of near-sighted business prudence .

		All this makes for an exaggerated intolerance of the minor disadvantages or even abuses inherent in every good movement , and for ' a tragic disregard of the great lost opportunities .

		We believe in higher education , in the value of the learned professions ; we should like a goodly share of the great contributions to science and invention , to art and literature , to noble thoughts and human endeavors , to emanate from Americans ; but we are chary or stupid in providing the free and effective play of forces , the favoring en - vironment which gives these blossoms their nurture .

		We see no reason why roses should not be grown like cabbages , and orchids like peas , and we want the roses thornless .

		We insist that the business methods that make the one crop flourish must be efficacious for the other .

		Foreign example is uncon - vincing , too heavily laden with conditions condemned by a triumphant democracy as out-of-date .

		And so our statesmanship in politics carries the flavor of the market-place and the outlook and insight of the '' boss '' ; and the guidance of cultural interests , re - flecting a kindred narrowness of perspective , fails or imperfectly succeeds by reason of the absence of just that superadded but indispensable touch of in - tellectual integrity and spiritual vision , that at that level divides the worthy from the unworthy results .

		Such is the law of the upper ranges of human quality and human standards .

		Defections wholly pardon - able , and not over-serious in their consequences for the ordinary interests of life , become fatal for the ex - traordinary ones .

		When we shall have learned this lesson and rendered to each of the learned classes the tribute that is its due , and shall entrust their interests to those imbued with the spirit thereof , we shall institute more liberal provisions for their wel - fare and administer more liberally those that favor - ing circumstances permit us to establish .

		Meanwhile the learned classes may accept the imposed or self - imposed burden of appreciatively though critically proclaiming the merit of good measures , while main - taining the struggle and the hope for the advent and the survival of the best .

UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		THE BEST SCHOOL OF LITERARY EXPRESSION , RC - cording to Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	in a noteworthy deliverence on '' Compulsory Composition in Col - leges , '' published in the
November	DATE	''
Harper	PERSON	, '' is the school of suffering . ''

		There is nothing like misery to improve the style , '' he affirms after citing Lincoln 's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	oration the eloquent utterance of a man of sorrows as an example of a style chastened by soul-trying experiences .

		The exaction of fre - quent themes from young persons having nothing to write and little power of clear expression he consid - ers foolishness .

		The general introduction , forty years ago , of English composition into our colleges has not , so far as he can see , tended to produce great masters of literary style ; and he would remove the compulsion and make this course an elective for the few and fit .

		Hard study , he believes , also can de - velop the muscles of the mind and do more to im - part a sinewy , vigorous , direct and powerful manner of expression than any amount of compulsory theme - writing .

		It can at least serve as a poor substitute for the hard knocks of life that made Grant and Lincoln so masterly and forcible with their pens .

		In what the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	emeritus professor of English says and he expresses himself at some length , and should be read in full there is much that must win every reader 's assent ; nevertheless , is it to be en - dured that graduates from our colleges should go out into the world unable to handle a pen with correct - ness and even some degree of elegance ?

		Under - graduate practice of some sort must be insisted upon for all .

		To wait for original ideas to move to utterance is in many instances like waiting for the water to come to him who would learn the art of swimming .

		... DR.
WILEY	PERSON	AS CLASSICAL SCHOLAR AND POET , as a former college instructor in
Latin	LOCATION	and Greek , as a linguist who can talk Romaic with the bootblack from
Athens	LOCATION	, and Latin with any Catholic priest or other
Latinist	LOCATION	, is undoubtedly far less known to the world than Dr.
Wiley	PERSON	the pure-food champion , the 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, '' big chief '' of the bureau of chemistry at Washing - ton , the utterer of witty sayings and maker of apt retorts , and the good comrade to those associated with him professionally or meeting him in the daily walks of life . ''

		If I had a child , '' he is reported to have said , '' I would teach it Latin at eight and Greek at ten ... This proposed new universal language Esperanto why , it is almost wholly Latin .

		Take the Latin away and there wouldn ' t be enough for a skeleton of : i language .

		Why don ' t they make a universal language of Latin ?

		It would be much more practical .

		Greek is not a dead lang - uage .

		There is more difference between the English of Chaucer and the English of to-day than there is between the
Greek of Homer	ORGANIZATION	and the Greek of to-day .

		I can talk Greek with bootblacks on the street and make myself understood and understand them . ''

		Dr.
Wiley	PERSON	is also the author of pastoral poetry or perhaps it should be called agricultural verse notably some dialect lines entitled '' Farmer
Johnson	PERSON	's Impressions of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, '' which are thought to have done as much for scientific farming as have his more serious labors in the
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	.

		A noteworthy and characteristic reply of his to a questioner who asked him why he did not retaliate on his enemies , was this : '' When I was a young man I made up my mind never to allow myself to harbor any personal resentment .

		It doesn ' t pay . ''

		His liberal education owes much to the influences of a home whose head , he declares , '' was a remarkable man . ''

		The literature he grew up on he states to have been the English Bible , the Greek Testament , `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' and '' The National Era '' the latter once well known as an anti-slavery journal .

		These , he says , '' I read and absorbed . ''

		... THE PUBLISHER 'S OPINION OF THE BOOK-REVIEW should carry weight , since he spends each year , if he does a large business , thousands of dollars in sup - plying the press with copies of his books for review purposes .

		A careful investigation of the matter by a writer in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' brings out some significant facts .

		Five or six prominent
New York	LOCATION	publishers were interviewed , and all agreed in em - phatic endorsement of the competent , discriminating review -LRB- whether favorable or the reverse -RRB- as a pow - erful aid in promoting the commercial success of a book . '

		You ca n't always trace it , '' said one of the publishers interviewed , '' but there is no doubt they -LSB- the reviews -RSB- introduce a book to the reader more readily , and command a more respectful attention , than a regular advertisement . ''

		Instances in his own experience were then cited by the speaker to illus - trate the effect of an appreciative expert appraisal of a book .

		`` It does n't matter , '' he added , '' in one sense , whether a review is favorable or unfavorable , so long as it is done seriously and competently . ''

		All the publishers interviewed seem to have been like - minded in their contempt for the unwisely laudatory review , the good-natured or ignorant estimate of a work at more than its genuine worth .

		They acquire , through much experience , the ability to see through an incompetent or complaisant reviewer , and they have no use for him .

		Also , they were unanimous in regarding the sales of fiction as not by any means so perceptively influenced by reviews , though they admitted that most novel-readers like to see what the reviewers have to say about the novels of the day ... KURAL EXTENSION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY claims the thought and energy of many librarians at present .

		In the current issues of both the In - diana '' Library Occurent '' and the
Vermont	LOCATION	'' Bulletin '' -LRB- periodical publications of the library commissions of these States -RRB- mention is made of this movement to carry the public library into the more thinly settled districts .

		Dry-goods boxes , painted a dark green , cheaply serve as transporta - tion cases ; a friendly farmer will often do the cart - ing for nothing ; and a schoolhouse , country store , or farmhouse can easily be found for the deposit of the precious freight .

		An ingenious and simple charging system with card-catalogue combined has been devised , which serves also as a record of the nature and extent of each book 's public service .

		These outlying deposit stations do not need large collections of books in order to attract borrowers ; quality is of greater importance than quantity .

		In
Indiana	LOCATION	, where whole townships are now receiving , for a proper consideration , the benefits of libraries hitherto exclusively used by smaller communities , the carrying of the books to the people seems to accomplish far more than the inviting of the people to the books .

		In Ludlow ,
Vermont	LOCATION	, baskets of books are sent out to the four district schools in town , and to ten schools in the surrounding towns .

		Who knows but this rural extension service may even tend to check the excessive and increasing flow of our country population city-ward ?

		... THE UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL OF '' TOM
SAWYER	PERSON	'' receives additional and notable tribute in the fact that a new series of Hebrew books for the young , just started in
London	LOCATION	, begins with a translation of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's masterpiece , under the title `` Meorarath Tom . ''

		Henceforth the immortal impersonation of all * that is most richly and delightfully typical of sturdy , irrepressible , adventure-loving , danger-daring boyhood will add a new joy to the life of the Jewish lad of
Rostov	LOCATION	or
Kazan	PERSON	, even as it has proved a joy and , in its way , an inspiration to the youth of this country and
England	LOCATION	.

		From the banks of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to those of the Yang-tse-kiang , Tom is as sure of making his way straight to the reader 's heart as is
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	or Sindbad the Sailor or
Jack	PERSON	the Giant-killer .

		Into how many tongues `` Tom
Sawyer	PERSON	'' has already been translated probably no one could say with anything like certainty ; but that it will eventually appear in Arabic and Chinese and Hindustani versions , if it has not already done so , would be a not very unsafe wager .

		THE DIAL 385 TOLSTOY 'S LAST PLAY , `` The Living Corpse , '' which is soon to be published in English together with a few posthumous stories and miscellanies , has appeared on the Russian stage and is about to ap - pear likewise in
Vienna	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and probably else - where .

		The plot of it the make-believe suicide of a magnanimous husband in order to remove the legal obstacle to his wife 's marriage with the man she really loves , and a base informer 's subsequent betrayal of the scheme to the police offers possi - bilities for sensational melodrama of a cheap sort ; but from such reports as have reached us the theme seems to have been handled in a manner not unworthy of the reformer and sage who chose it -LRB- from the court records of
Moscow	LOCATION	-RRB- as the subject of a philosophical drama .

		The unselfishness of the husband , who finally kills himself in earnest to unsnarl the matrimonial tangle , and the native human goodness of all the principals concerned -LRB- except the blackmailing informer -RRB- , are brought out and emphasized in idealistic fashion , with a corresponding subordination of the gruesome or criminal aspects of the case .

		Pathetic is the illus - tration here offered of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's belief to the last in human goodness so long as it is not warped or sup - pressed by social order or man-made law or other artificial restraint or violence .

		THE
POMFRET	LOCATION	PLAN OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT , devised by the
Pomfret	LOCATION	librarian , Mrs.
Abba Doton Chamberlin	PERSON	, is admirably adapted to the needs of small towns just such towns , in fact , as
Pomfret	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, where it is giving great satisfaction .

		The
Pomfret Public Library	ORGANIZATION	dates from
1896	DATE	, the library building , given by Judge
Ira A. Abbott	PERSON	, from
1905	DATE	, and the present administration from
1907	DATE	.

		Here are some brief extracts from a most interesting pamphlet entitled '' A
Vermont	LOCATION	Library , '' written chiefly by Mrs.
Chamberlin	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, and attractively printed at the
Elm Tree Press	ORGANIZATION	, of
Woodstock	LOCATION	,
Vt.	LOCATION	.

		On
May 1 , 1907	DATE	, '' says Mrs.
Chamberlin	PERSON	, `` I became , at Judge
Abbott	PERSON	's request , librarian .

		Since then the library has always been open , for I live in the building .

		I know every - body , old and young , in the town , and so need no system of registering borrowers .

		Books are lent to all who ask for them , and charged on slips in the simplest possible way . '' ''

		Records are carefully kept , but no fines are taken for overdue books .

		We put our patrons on their honor , and they are loyal to us . '' ''

		The building is open each week day at all reasonable hours , just as is every farmhouse .

		On
Sundays	DATE	it is open from 2 to 6 p. m. '' '' It struck me that the first thing to do was to try to make the rooms look a little more social .

		I had a mahogany parlor set of furniture ; a good musical instrument in a rosewood case ; an old mahogany dining table ; some dainty stands and various other things .

		These I moved in .

		City people coming in would say , ' I '11 give you
$ 100	MONEY	for that table ! '

		But the reply always was , ' It answers very well where it is for the present . ' ''

		Mrs.
Chamberlin	PERSON	has instituted ingen - ious devices for publicity ; has caused every school - house in town to become a branch library ; has other - wise pushed the usefulness of her library into the remotest corner of
Pomfret	LOCATION	, which covers thirty-six square miles ; has made arbitrary rules give way to reason ; has , in short , proved herself a born libra - rian , and has attracted admiring attention from far beyond the borders of
Pomfret	LOCATION	which , by the way , is a little town of only seven hundred inhabitants .

		FINANCING A NEW TRANSLATION OF THE AN - CIENT CLASSICS would not appeal to every retired banker as a desirable mode of occupying one 's lei - sure and employing one 's surplus revenue .

		All the more , then , does it redound to the credit of Mr.
James Loeb	PERSON	that he should propose to himself this enterprise as a means of popularizing , so far as may be , a portion of the world 's best but at present least - read literature .

		Here is a project far more serious than drawing up a list of the hundred best books , or suggesting suitable candidates for a five-foot library - shelf .

		Where will the adequately-equipped trans - lators be found thorough classical scholars who are at the same time free from the pedantry of spec - ialization and gifted with powers of apt and idiomatic and pleasing literary expression ?

		Humanists and not philologists or grammarians are called for ; but modern classical drill has been designed to produce the latter rather than the former .

		How many at present have the mingled qualities of scholarship and enthusiasm and literary taste to do for Homer or Tacitus what
Munro	PERSON	so excellently did for
Lucretius	PERSON	, and Conington for
Virgil	PERSON	, and
Jowett	PERSON	for Plato ?

		As an illustration of the possible attractiveness and readability of a translated classic , the version of
Horace	PERSON	's Letters noticed in our preceding issue may be cited , though a would-be popular edition should not be of the limited or de luxe sort .

		That Mr.
Loeb	PERSON	will find his properly-equipped translators and successfully carry through his project , is to be hoped by all friends to the cause of good literature .

		BOOK-PRODUCTION IN
CANADA	LOCATION	is reported from
Toronto	LOCATION	as still an almost negligible quantity , so far as the actual manufacture of the books is concerned .

		The
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	demanded its own special copyright law , but the market for literary wares remains so small and so inactive that rarely does it prove prof - itable to publish at home .

		The great publishers of the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	receive in growing numbers the manuscripts of Canadian writers , and not a few of these get themselves published each year .

		The present season brings forth an unusual number of books treating historically and descrip - tively of
Canada	LOCATION	itself , chiefly by Englishmen who have been visiting the country and travelling espe - cially in its vast new West .

		Other departments of literature are represented by works of Canadian au - thorship , but in a population no larger than
Canada	LOCATION	's not very many poets and novelists and historians and essayists can be reasonably looked for .

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, MEMOIRS OF A FREE-THINKER AND FREE-LANCE .

		* In the opening chapter of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's '' Autobiographic Memoirs , '' two substantial volumes crowded with the memories and the meditations of four-score years , the assertion is made that `` biography , the typical literature of our age , feels the reaction of the ceaseless multiplication of lives to record , until the best and greatest lives are too often over - whelmed in the flow of the obscure and the commonplace .

		But , '' adds the writer , `` about this it is not for me to say more , for I am con - scious of * giving myself away . ' ''

		Luckily he did not dwell so long on the plethora of '' lives '' now filling our bookshelves as to become deterred from the project of adding one more , but felt that if the story of his own life were ever to be told in print he himself was the one best fitted to tell that story accurately and in sufficient detail .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	,
Oct. 18 , 1831	DATE	, of well-to-do parents , who gave careful , possibly too careful , attention to his education .

		Habits of revery and introspection , which less often show themselves in boys that rub elbows and exchange fisticuffs with their kind , appear to have been his in childhood and youth .

		From
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, on his twenty-first birthday , we find him writing to his mother a letter which he now publishes in part , to show what a '' sententious prig '' he once was .

		A short passage may amuse the reader , as it must have amused the writer sixty years after . ''

		You may fancy the last few days -LRB- entering as I am on full age -RRB- have had for me no ordinary significance ; and that the epoch , a turning-point at once a goal and a starting-post in life has filled me with vague and yet powerful emotions as I approached it .

		I have never yet stepped from a lower to a more important sphere without hesitation and apprehension , and I do so no less now in this strange advance .

		In truth , it is an awful time ; and yet , the feelings it awakens are so complicated and vague , so mingled with hope and fear , with self-confidence and backward regrets , that I can not comprehend and explain them whilst even now the new necessities and duties commence dreams must give way to action , and work is thrust upon my hands and gives no place for reflection . ''

		The devout tone of some of these early letters , and their writer 's ready acceptance of the relig - ion of his forebears , do not exactly picture the child as father of the man in his case , though probably the truth is that the devotion and the AUTOBIOGRAPHIC MEMOIRS .

		By
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, D.C.L. , Litt.D. , LL.D .

		In two volumes , with portraits
New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		reverence have in the intervening years merely changed their declared objects rather than suf - fered any diminution .

		Even in the '' awful time '' referred to above , the serious young man felt a repugnance for the Church as a profession , and therefore complied with his father 's desire that he should study for the Bar .

		But these studies were half-heartedly undertaken , with no expectation or even wish to excel as a barrister ; and consequently , though he practised several years with success , we soon find his attention diverted to other interests to literature , to
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy , to art , to travel , to public questions , to sundry warm personal friendships , notably with
Ruskin	PERSON	and with his former tutor
Richard Congreve	PERSON	.

		As a valuable initiation into general literature , he had discharged , ap - parently with unusual zeal and faithfulness , the duties of librarian of the
Oxford Union	ORGANIZATION	; and in the fine arts his home influences and early reading and studies had made him no mean con - noisseur .

		Among other details of this highly interesting period in Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's life it must not be forgotten that he won , to his surprise and gratification , a fellowship in his college -LRB-
Wadham	PERSON	-RRB- , which he seems to have held until his marriage
fifteen years later	DATE	.

		The following passage from an early chapter is of significance , especially if one reads between the lines : `` The only
University Prize	ORGANIZATION	which ever attracted me was the Arnold Essay The Jews in
Europe	LOCATION	in the Mid - dle Ages ,
1856	DATE	.

		This seemed to me a really interesting study , and I set about it with spirit .

		Through
Miss A. M. Goldsmid	PERSON	, the learned daughter of Sir
Isaac	PERSON	, the first baronet , I was introduced to Dr.
Lowe	PERSON	, an eminent rabbi and Hebrew scholar , who gave me a most useful list of books and other suggestions for research .

		I con - tinued making notes and collecting volumes for some time ; but as I was particularly anxious that John Bridges should win the prize , I handed my materials to him , knowing that he would use them much better than I could .

		This he did , and gained the prize by an admir - able essay , published in the Oxford Essays of
1857	DATE	.

		This prize and the
Oriel Fellowship	ORGANIZATION	amply redressed his failure to secure his
First Class	ORGANIZATION	in the
Honours School	ORGANIZATION	.

		By the way , I find in an old letter of that date that one of the examiners had admitted to the tutors ' that Bridges was the ablest man in . '

		Oxford Class Lists indeed have as many surprises as horse-racing .

		The ` ablest , ' like the fleetest , does not always come first to the post . ''

		The public life of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	his member - ship on a trades-union commission in 1867-69 , his services in the
London	LOCATION
County Council	ORGANIZATION	from
1889	DATE	to
1893	DATE	, his later holding of a county magistracy in Kent , and other activities for the public good contains for the reader so much less of interest than his literary life and private studies , that no excuse need be offered for dwell - ing chiefly on the latter .

		A seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	seems to have been well within Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 reach , had he cared to turn to politics , and there were other ways open that might have led to high public position ; but no desire for such honors and emoluments seems ever to have been enter - tained by him .

		Concerning his growth into independence of thought in religious matters , the eminent Posi - tivist takes his readers into his confidence , as follows : '' As to religious opinion , it is always difficult to make a sure retrospect .

		But I think this was the truth .

		I was brought up at home and at school an orthodox be - liever , sincerely adopting prayer , services , and sacrament in the ordinary way as a moderate High Churchman .

		Yeast ,
Maurice	PERSON	,
F. Newman	PERSON	's Theism , Mill , and
Mazzini	PERSON	, together , made my orthodoxy melt away .

		I had taken the sacrament at my Confirmation as a believer in Tran - substantiaticn , and I continued to take it , apart from any supernatural idea , but without disgust or contempt at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the whole orthodox fabric melted away in me , mainly on moral grounds , such as
F. Xewman	PERSON	and
F. D. Maurice	PERSON	used , and from growing disgust with such Catholicism as that of
J. H. Xewman	PERSON	and
Pusey	PERSON	, and such Philistine Protestantism as that of
B. Symons	PERSON	. ''

		There was no '' sudden revulsion of opinion and feeling , '' he adds , nor did he '' ever experi - ence any qualm or anxiety of conscience . '' ''

		I should , '' he asserts , ' * at all times of my life have regarded it as ludicrous to be either uneasy or ashamed of believing what it seemed to me to be true to believe . ''

		In a later chapter he takes occasion to dispel '' sundry foolish myths '' con - cerning
Xewton Hall	PERSON	and the seekers after truth who regularly met there .

		`` We at Xewton Hall have treated these visions -LSB- of
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- with reverence ; but we have never dreamed of witnessing in our age any such Apocalypse , and as - suredly we have never presumed to attempt any crude model of a society which after ages will have to work out in reality and which must follow and not precede an entire re-organization of life and thought .

		We have not presumed to use the sacred name of a church for our tentative group .

		We have had no priest , no ritual , no adoration , no ceremonial .

		We have not assumed to speak of ' service * , ' or worship , ' or religion , ' except - ing in so far as the ' Service of Man ' may mean the fulfilment of human duties , or as < worship ' may mean manifest honor and reverence for whatsoever things are true , whatsoever are honest , whatsoever are just , what - soever are pure , whatsoever are lovely .

		If there be any virtue , if there be any praise , we think on these things , and that is wonky . ''

		In a retrospect covering so long a period , it is natural that the author should see much that seems to him a change for the worse in later years .

		Methods of education , both elementary and advanced , have in his judgment sadly dete - riorated .

		He believes that the private dav-school which he attended from his tenth to his twelfth year taught its pupils as much in two years as boys now learn in five . ''

		And the learning was in itself a delight , instead of a task , an impo - sition , a struggle . ''

		This , in the face of the present solicitous endeavor to make easy and inviting the road to knowledge , is significant .

		As to more advanced and special studies , he ex - presses himself with even greater emphasis and with an unusual richness of epithet . ''

		Alas !

		from all that I bear to-day , the mania for specialization and the parrot - like imitation of German Cloud-cuckoo-land and
Nephelo-Coccygian Metaphys	PERSON	- ics , has overlaid Plato and Aristotle ,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Locke	LOCATION	,
Hume	PERSON	,
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Butler	PERSON	, and
Kant	PERSON	with gaseous worlds of post-Kantian , Xeo-Hegelian fumes and exhalations which bedim the old philosophies , so that they are seen to-day as if they were the sun in a
London	LOCATION	fog ... The result of all this interminable specialization into fissiparous trivialties , joined to a habit of treating onto - logical locutions as ideas and realities , has in half a century deteriorated
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	training and clouded over
Oxford	LOCATION	thought .

		It is my deliberate opinion that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	does not breed in the twentieth century powers of mind so robust , so fertile , and so original as it did in the middle of the nineteenth century .

		The reason I take to be that the discovery of some new but insignifi - cant fact is looked on as displacing grasp of thought , mental synthesis , and any attempt to view the world and man as organic wholes .

		Thought as such is dis - credited by the preposterous value attributed to novel , but quite subordinate , positive facts .

		And as to the imaginative use of language , charm of memorable com - position , symmetry and grace of style , the modern tend - ency is to regard anything of the kind with suspicion and contempt . ''

		There the equipoise and serenity of the octo - genarian philosopher fail to shine conspicuous .

		The educational system of any age is at best an imperfect and tentative one ; but it would be too painful , as well as unreasonable , to believe our own times wrapped in so dense a '' nephelo - coccygian '' darkness in the things of the intel - lect as this praiser of the past professes to believe .

		To dispel the gloomy vision , here is a pleasing though unsparing pen-sketch of Buskin : '' '
John	PERSON	' was the ideal of an airy , generous , fantastic , lovable man of genius , whose fancies bubbled forth clear and inexhaustible like a mountain
spring	DATE	.

		He was everything that one could imagine of friendly wel - come , of simple nature , of incalculable epigram and paradox ... He was always ready to talk to ask questions even to listen .

		But as to allowing any man 's thoughts , any book old or new , to assist , qualify , or enter into his own thoughts , it was not to be endured .

		... I came away delighted with the charm of this brilliant and generous nature , full of admiration for the marvellous agility of his inspiration , but puzzled and even saddened by the sight of such impracticable au - dacity and waywardness . ''

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's impressions of
America	LOCATION	, which he visited ten years ago , formed the subject of a paper in `` The Nineteenth Century , '' afterward reprinted in his '' Memories and Thoughts , '' so that there is not very much of importance for him to add on that subject in his present work .

		That he is not immoderate in his praise of our 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, country and its institutions becomes apparent enough in such passages as the following : '' But in spite of all , notwithstanding the low level of American manners , taste , literature , and art , I do hold that our feudal and Catholic traditions of birth , caste , ritual , privilege , and war will ultimately be ' superseded by republican patriotism .

		Autocracy , Aris - tocracy , Democracy , will eventually grow into Soci - oracy t. e. , rule in the interest of the social whole .

		And a true Sociocracy is most likely to grow up in a people where the anti-social prejudices are most com - pletely extinct . ''

		But he has only good words for
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		So little , '' he writes in a letter appended to the American chapter , `` is
Chicago	LOCATION	a city of corn * deals ' and pig-curing , that I heard nothing there but philanthropy , education , social im - provement , and art studies . ''

		He calls the chief of
Chicago	LOCATION	's educational institutions '' a wonder - ful
University	ORGANIZATION	, '' whose '' seventy-nine Professors and Professorinnen '' he heartily praises , but he is strangely misinformed or forgetful in speaking of the university as '' built by
Chicago	LOCATION	citizens . ''

		So rich and wide-ranging a retrospect from the pen of so keen an observer , so clear a thinker , so fearless a critic , and so engaging a writer , rarely issues from the press to minister to the enjoyment of the English-reading world .

		Be - gun with the intention of merely preserving old memories for the gratification of the writer 's chil - dren , the book maintains throughout a candor and a fulness of detail that not every autobiog - rapher would allow himself in preparing a work for the general public .

		Hence no small part of its value and charm .

		Of course it contains here and there matter that has appeared in sub - stance in one or another of the author 's recent books , in his '' Creed of a Layman , '' or in his `` Memories and Thoughts , '' but the work as a whole is of fresh and abundant interest , as well as of unstudied charm of style .

		The fact is , to the traveller who appreciates how different is the mental horizon that goes with another stage of culture or another type of social organization than his own , the Chinese do not seem very puzzling .

		Allowing for differences in outfit of knowledge and fundamental ideas , they act much as we should act under their circumstances .

		The theory , dear to liter - ary interpreters of the Orient , that owing to diversity in mental constitution the yellow man and the white man can never comprehend or sympathize with one another , will appeal little to those who from their com - parative study of societies have gleaned some notion of what naturally follows from isolation , the acute strug - gle for existence , ancestor worship , patriarchal authority , the subjection of women , the decline of militancy , and the ascendency of scholars . ''

		Of the ten chapters two are distinctly descrip - tive . ''

		China to the Ranging Eye '' is an im - pressionistic study of some of the things which held the attention of the careful traveller , while '' The Far West of the Far East '' is the story of a journey of twelve hundred miles from
Taiyuanfu	LOCATION	, in
Shansi	LOCATION	, to
Chengtu	LOCATION	, in
Szechuan	LOCATION	.

		Since Professor
Ross	PERSON	's return , Chengtu , '' the most progressive of pure Chinese cities , '' has been the centre of a rebellion , and the Viceroy
Chao Erh-Sen	PERSON	, who took such pride in his capital , has been reported the victim of assas - sination .

		Three of the chapters are to a large degree narrative . ''

		The Grapple with the Opium Evil '' tells the story of the great moral struggle which has been in progress during the past five years . ''

		Unbinding the Women of
China	LOCATION	; ' is concerned with the mind and heart , as well as with the feet ; for '' all the railroads that may be built , all the mines that may be opened , all the trade that may be fostered , can - not add half as much to the happiness of the Chinese people as the cultivation of their ' unde - veloped resources ' their womanhood . ''

		The chapter on '' Christianity in
China	LOCATION	'' will delight the believer in foreign missions , and will give the critic something to ponder over ; for Pro- fessor
Ross	PERSON	is confident of the ultimate triumph of the faith in
China	LOCATION	, if only it keeps its grip upon the
West	LOCATION	.

		The five remaining chapters contain much that is deeply suggestive . ''

		The Race Fibre
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI , 389 of the Chinese '' not only points out the '' ob - served toughness '' of that people , but shows why the white man is justified in excluding him from his labor-market . ''

		The Race Mind of the Chinese '' offers an explanation for the '' patent stagnation of the collective mind , '' and maintains that '' the future bearers and advancers of civilization will be , not the whites alone , but the white and yellow races ; and the control of the globe will lie in the hands of the two races instead of one . ''

		Terrible in its vividness is the chapter describing '' The Strug - gle for Existence '' ; and for this grinding mass of poverty the one general cause is given as '' the crowding of population upon the means of subsistence . ''

		Of special interest to the members of our '' slow - multiply ing , high - wage '' white society is the prophecy in '' The Indus - trial Future of
China	LOCATION	. ''

		Cheap and skilful as the labor may be , `` It is not likely that the march of industrialism in
China	LOCATION	will be so rapid and triumphant as many have anticipated .

		Jealousy of the foreigner , dearth of cap - ital , ignorant labor , official squeeze , graft , nepotism , lack of experts , and inefficient management will long delay the harnessing of the cheap labor power of
China	LOCATION	to the machine .

		Not we , nor our children , but our grandchildren , will need to lie awake nights .

		It is along in
the latter half of this century	DATE	that the yellow man 's economic competition will begin to mould with giant hands the politics of the planet . ''

		Finally , '' The New Education '' describes some of the difficulties and the weaknesses of the new programme .

		Much is explained by this comment : `` The broad contrast between
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	in utilizing Western scholars runs back to their difference in attitude toward our civilization .

		The Japanese were humble and teachable .

		Long ago they had borrowed heavily from the mainland , and they were not too proud to sit awhile at the feet of Western scholars .

		But the Chinese , remembering that their culture is all their own , are still too haughty to recognize fully their need of the foreign educator . ''

		And the following tale should be added to those which are current in many of our universities : '' I even heard of a Manchu literary chancellor who could not read the examination essays submitted for provincial honors .

		So he piled them on the canopy of his bed , poked them with his cane as he lay smoking his pipe , and the thirteen that slid off first were declared winners . ''

		Many more quotations might find their way into this review , for the volume abounds in striking passages .

		Enough , however , have been given to show why this brilliant sociological study holds the reader 's interest from cover to cover .

		Exception may be taken to an infer - ence here or a prophecy there for it takes no little bravery to peer into the future of things Chinese ; but so interesting is the treatment throughout , so vivid the descriptions , so incisive the arguments , so clear the conclusions , that the volume will appeal to an unusually wide public and must be considered a notable contribution to the literature on that remarkable land , now undergoing a transformation which is watched with interest throughout the world .

		CAVOUR ANI > THE MAP OF
ITALY	LOCATION	.

		* In
October , 1850	DATE	, when d' Azeglio presented the name of
Cavour	PERSON	for
the Ministry of Com	ORGANIZATION	- merce and Agriculture ,
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	re - plied , '' Don ' t you gentlemen see that that little fellow will send you all heels over head ? ''

		The plump little man , with his head full of statistics and his heart full of the Liberal Idea , was in - deed destined , not perhaps to send the minis - ters flying , but at least to change the map of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It is for this one thing the creation of the Kingdom of
Italy	LOCATION	that
Cavour	PERSON	will be remembered , and for this alone .

		Indeed , his life presents singularly little else of interest .

		While yet a boy , he dreamed of some day being first minister of his country ; the decade of his public life was wholly devoted to the great task , which was scarcely accomplished before he died ; and no master of romance could have put more appropriate words into the mouth of a dying hero than those actually uttered by Cavour ''
Italy	LOCATION	is made , all is safe . ''

		But the work of
Cavour	PERSON	was felt far beyond the limits of his own country , for it was the decisive event in that series of transformations which effected the political reconstruction of
Europe	LOCATION	on the basis of nationality and constitutional govern - ment .

		It does not often fall to the lot of even a great man , by devoting himself exclusively to one task , to decide the destiny of his country , and thereby drive the main currents of history into new channels .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	has given us a life of Cavour commensurate in scope with the importance of the subject ; and if it proves not to be a master - piece of historical biography , it will at least rank with the scholarly and well-constructed histories of the present time .

		He has studied , apparently with great care , all the available sources ; and the printed sources are abundant sufficiently so , it seems , to make it unlikely that further * THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CAVOUR .

		390 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, search in archives would greatly add to our knowledge or furnish the basis for any new con - clusion of importance .

		In the main drift and substance of the story , therefore , Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	offers nothing new ; but in clear and detailed exposition of events he offers much that is new , at least to English readers .

		One must admire the skill with which he has picked out the tangled skein of diplomatic negotiations , and the persist - ence with which he follows the devious under - ground ways of the secret societies .

		Those who have tried to work out the genesis of the Sicilian expedition , or to arrive at some clear notion of the exact part which was taken in that movement by
Garibaldi	PERSON	, the Mazzinians , the National So - ciety , and above all by
Cavour	PERSON	himself , will be grateful to Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	for his excellent treat - ment of a complicated subject .

		Details of importance , too often omitted or distorted , such as the statement of Napoleon to Hiibner on New Year 's Day
1859	DATE	, or the fact that
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	knew before the battle of
Solferino	LOCATION	that the Emperor was contemplating a truce with
Austria	LOCATION	, one finds correctly stated here .

		And then , Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	has the rare merit of making his people real .


Garibaldi	PERSON	,
d' Azeglio	LOCATION	,
Farina	LOCATION	,
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	,
Brofferio	PERSON	, are not so many lay figures , but men of flesh and blood , that the reader comes to know apart , and to like , too , in their different ways , even though Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	, one suspects , does not always as in the case of Brofferio particularly like them himself .

		Of Cavour we have on the whole a faithful and certainly a most engaging portrait ; while the exposition of his aims , and of his transcendent genius in meeting and overcoming the difficulties that faced him on every side , leaves little to be desired .

		Cavour professed that sort of political philos - ophy which is generally known as Liberalism .

		`` I am the son of Liberty , '' he said , `` and to her I owe all that I am , '' and to her , it might be added , as Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	wishes us to under - stand , he gave his life .

		But
Cavour	PERSON	understood Liberty in terms of that golden mean which the adherents of the school not infrequently found so convenient a substitute for logical principles .

		Viewed from the standpoint of a later day , Lib - eralism is seen to have been the halfway house on the road from absolutism to democracy or not quite that perhaps , the first stage rather ; and it found its chief support in the well-to-do middle class .

		The highly respectable and alto - gether conventional bourgeois , immortalized in the pages of
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Balzac	LOCATION	, and of which the archtype is the Citizen King with his green umbrella -LRB- who indeed would push the principle of Liberty so far as to wish the privilege of being scorched by the sun or wet by the rain ? -RRB-

		this excellent middle-class found the great dogma of the Mean exactly to its liking .

		Liberty there must be , certainly , but not too much of it , and only for the right sort of people : political lib - erty for those who had money enough to appre - ciate its advantages ; industrial liberty for those who wished to increase profits , but not always for those who wished to raise wages ; intellectual and religious liberty for all except the inde - cently eccentric or the uncomfortably original .

		Nothing too much , said the neat Liberal not quite in the Greek sense .

		Liberalism , as it lay in the quiescent mind of the bourgeois , was doubtless crude enough .

		But there were not wanting statesmen and essayists to clothe the interests of a class in decent and attractive theory .

		Let us have , they said , free - dom in government , in industry , in thought , in religion , to the end that every man may develop to the highest point the best that is in him ; only thus shall justice prevail , ignorance and superstition and intolerance disappear , poverty and war be banished , and peace , prosperity , and happiness be universally diffused at last .

		Now ,
Cavour	PERSON	's Liberalism was strong precisely be - cause it was grounded upon class interest and at the same time attractively shaped in terms of this plausible theory .

		Cavour was , through his own industry , a rich man , and bis vigorous in - telligence always , as
Medici	PERSON	said , essentially at '' the level of circumstances '' was just the sort to be captivated by a theory at once so simple and so comprehensive . ''

		With the ever greater realization of this principle , '' he said and he was always repeating it , '' there must fol - low a greater welfare for all , but especially for the least favored classes . ''

		This was the very essence of the Liberal philosophy the sim - ple faith that liberty wisely ordered by the few would bring in its train that essential quality dreamed of by the many .

		The Liberal Idea thus became for
Cavour	PERSON	, as for many another gener - ous mind of that day , the open sesame to the millennium . ''

		A calico millennium , '' laughed
Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		At least a concrete one , and safe , ''
Cavour	PERSON	might have replied .

		And Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	, one suspects , would say so too .

		He is so heartily in sympathy with
Cavour	PERSON	, with his philosophy , with his practical policy , that his book may not unjustly be called an apol - ogy for liberal constitutionalism an apology in the older sense of the word , the sense of a valiant justification .

		Perhaps apology is after
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 391 all not the right word ; but I wish to say that Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	seems not so much to have adopted
Cavour	PERSON	's point of view just temporarily , for historical purposes , as never to have ventured very far away from it .

		He sees the drama from
Cavour	PERSON	's angle of vision , because , like
Cavour	PERSON	, he habitually sits in the mean distance ; like
Cavour	PERSON	, therefore , he can not quite understand how the play looks to those who sit at ease in the boxes , or strain uncomfortably forward from the gallery .

		This is the prime defect : Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	is so much of a liberal himself that he can not be quite fair to those who were not in sympathy with
Cavour	PERSON	's methods , or to those who stood in the way of his aims ; and thus the three determining forces of that time con - servatism , liberalism , radicalism are presented to the reader in somewhat false perspective .

		Of Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's treatment of
Mazzini	PERSON	and the radicals , one need not complain much .

		The portrait of the incorrigible idealist , whom it was impossible not to love yet never quite safe to follow , is well and sympathetically drawn ; and for the most part we are led to suppose that his work was indispensable to Italian unity -LRB- I. , 274 , 542 , II. , 233 -RRB- , although occasionally one infers that
Cavour	PERSON	was quite right in dismissing him as an unmitigated nuisance .

		However , this question is hardly as important for the biographer of
Cavour	PERSON	as the question of the validity of
Mazzini	PERSON	's criticism of
Cavour	LOCATION	.

		The full force of this criticism Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	does not , I think , sufficiently emphasize ; and of this something presently .

		It is chiefly among the conservatives that Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	finds himself , like goodman Tul - liver , in a world that is , if not precisely too much for him , at least fairly puzzling .

		The English Tory , for example , he thinks a good sort of person . ''

		Often he is not consciously selfish '' ; but the defect of a Tory is that '' how - ever patriotic he may be , he can not understand patriotism in others . ''

		This is amusing enough , and harmless too .

		But Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's dislike of the Austrian and Italian reactionaries is almost as great as that of Cavour himself ; and that is more serious , for it fixes his attention somewhat too much upon the Bombas and
Antonellis	PERSON	to the neglect of that wide-spread and genuine conservative sentiment without which these puppets despicable enough , truly would long since have been brushed aside .


Austria	LOCATION	was not so wholly perverse as one is led to suppose . ''


Austria	LOCATION	, '' indeed , was more truly a geograph - ical expression than
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Francis Joseph	PERSON	can hardly be censured for his aversion to the very principles national independence and liberty which , if allowed to become practi - cally operative , would have dissolved his empire , and , indeed , came very near dissolving it in
1848	DATE	, without much prospect of becoming prac - tically operative at that .

		The shadow of '93 was still over
Europe	LOCATION	, and how much the events of
1848	DATE	had deepened it Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	will by no means let us see : the anarchy that had pre - vailed for weeks in the streets of
Paris	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	not only struck terror to the puppet rulers of
Italy	LOCATION	, but gave pause to many a stead - fast liberal in every country of
Europe	LOCATION	as well .

		`` We demand , '' said
Marche	PERSON	, addressing the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	in behalf of the
Paris	LOCATION	radicals , '' the extermination of property and capitalists , the immediate installation of the pro- letariat in community of goods , the proscription of bankers , the rich , the merchants , the bour - geoisie of every condition above that of wage - earners , the acceptance of the red flag to signify to society defeat , to the people victory , to
Paris	LOCATION	the Terror , and to all foreign governments inva - sion . ''

		A pleasant programme !

		but one which helps to explain why so many men were willing to suffer such evils as the Hapsburgs rather than to fly to others that they knew not of .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's remarks on the
Church	ORGANIZATION	would furnish a hostile critic with many fine open - ings .

		He honestly endeavors to distinguish the Church and the Catholic religion from those that represented it .

		In this I think he is not very successful . ''

		The romanticists , '' he says , '' represented medieval life , not as it was , but as if the ideals of a few had been the practice of all . ''

		One might turn this epigram a little differently , and apply it with some justice to Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	himself : he is too much inclined to represent the Church as if the practices of a few had been the ideals of all .

		This prejudice must account for many statements which , besides being unnecessary for the author 's main pur - pose , are misleading . ''

		I believe because it is impossible , '' which is ascribed to Saint Anselm , expresses precisely the thing for which Saint
Anselm	PERSON	did not stand ; more than any other scholastic , he was keen to demonstrate that what he believed could be shown by reason to be not only possible but necessary .

		Doubtless Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	knows this very well .

		And he must know , too , that the doctrine of Infallibility refers only to '' the definition of doctrine in faith and morals , '' and not to Papal action in estab - lishing a form of government for the patrimony of Saint
Peter	PERSON	.

		Besides , the doctrine of Infal - libility was not promulgated until twenty years 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, after
Pius	PERSON	had withdrawn his liberal concessions .

		Let us not apply , even to the Pope , that flagrantly unliberal thing , an ex post facto law -LRB- I. , 188 -RRB- .

		We are told that it was the mission of Cavour '' to mediate between an era that is passing away and a new era that has not yet taken definite form . ''

		This is true enough ; and there is one aspect of this mediation , and a rather important one , which may be noted in conclusion .

		If
Cavour	PERSON	did much to bring in the new era , he did something also to perpetuate the spirit of the old .

		It may , indeed , be said of Cavour that he placed some of the very rocks upon which the ship of Liberalism in which he sailed as pilot has made at least partial shipwreck .

		The point may be conveniently presented by referring again to the criticism of Cavour by
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	quotes in part the fam - ous letter which
Mazzini	PERSON	wrote in answer to
Cavour	PERSON	's speech of
April 16 , 1858	DATE	.

		In this let - ter
Mazzini	PERSON	charges
Cavour	PERSON	, among other things , with '' bowing the knee to force , '' and with cor - rupting the youth of
Italy	LOCATION	by '' a policy of arti - fice and lies . ''

		These charges cut deep , and very deep .

		The justification of
Cavour	PERSON	's meth - ods depends upon the sincerity of his faith in the value of the liberal programme ; and yet his utterly unscrupulous methods , the '' policy of ar - tifice and lies , '' implied a repudiation of Liber - alism at its best .

		Nor was it a mere rhetorical flourish to say that Cavour '' bowed the knee to force . ''

		Of course
Mazzini	PERSON	was all for force , too .

		But the difference , as he saw it , was vital :
Mazzini	PERSON	appealed to the force of the oppressed themselves , to that '' force inspired by the love of Liberty , '' but
Cavour	PERSON	appealed to force which existed for the purpose precisely of holding lib - erty in check .

		To go to
Plombidres	LOCATION	, to cede Sa - voy , to welcome assistance from the man who for ten years had set his heel on freedom in
France	LOCATION	, to employ in the service of Liberty the polluted hands of cynics who said in their hearts there is no Liberty , this was `` to bow the knee to force , '' and for a temporary advantage betray the cause of humanity in the end .

		So thought
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		Few now think with him .

		Yet there is much in the history of the
last half century	DATE	to con - firm his opinion .

		It may be true that Italian unity could be achieved only by
Cavour	ORGANIZATION	's method .

		If so , the price of Italian unity was certainly higher than
Cavour	PERSON	imagined .

		What
Mazzini	PERSON	saw was that the methods used by
Cavour	PERSON	to give liberty to
Italy	LOCATION	would in the end do much to discredit the very faith he professed .

		If the old Liberalism has become for the
Europe	LOCATION	of to-day little more than the shadow of a dream , if the worship of facts has in any measure replaced the worship of ideas , if faith in '' blood and iron '' has grown strong and faith in '' speeches and resolutions of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment '' has fallen away , if in statesmanship there has been a return to the spirit of Metternich and
Frederick II.	PERSON	, certainly
Cavour	PERSON	's suave machia - vellianism , no less than
Bismarck	PERSON	's brutal cynic - ism , has done something to bring about that re - sult .

		It is probable that
Cavour	PERSON	did more than
Mazzini	PERSON	to unite
Italy	LOCATION	; it is certain that he did more to divide humanity .

		RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS OF A REGULAR , * When a man has rendered fifty years of public service he has necessarily witnessed the making of a great deal of history .

		If he has filled high stations a good part of this time , and can truly say of the events , Quorum pars magna fui , he ought to have an interesting story to narrate .

		Such conditions are fulfilled by Senator Cullom , who has just given to the world his reminiscences of fifty years in public life .

		The Senator has not undertaken to write a history of the last fifty years .

		Rather , he has given us a Homeric catalogue of the worthies -LRB- there seem to have been no unworthies -RRB- , has thrown a few side-lights on the history of the earlier part of this period , and has made a few contributions to the real history of some of the events in which he took a leading part .

		The pages covering the period down to the early eighties will be of interest to the casual reader , but of little value to the serious student of his - tory .

		The Congressional history of that period has been so thoroughly written up that perhaps there is little to add , unless some participant has some '' confessions '' or revelations to make .

		If Senator Cullom has none , there seems to be no good reason why he should gloss over the notorious characters of that and the later period in his Homeric catalogue .

		Some of them are , indeed , referred to as `` bosses , '' but with no hint of their baneful influence on public life .

		Shortly after
Cleveland	LOCATION	's famous message of
1887	DATE	precipitated the Tariff discussion ,
Thomas B. Reed	PERSON	perpetrated the following droll allegory : '' Once there was a little dog .

		By and by he came to a stream bridged by a plank .

		He trotted along , and looking over the side of t
$ *	MONEY	e plank , he saw the markets of the world , and dived for them .

		A minute afterwards he was crawl - ing up the hank , the wettest , the sickest , the nastiest , the most muttonless dog that ever swam ashore , '' The Democrats were the dogs , made the dive in the
Mills Bill	PERSON	, and crawled out on the bank of defeat in
1888	DATE	.

		The Senator might have told us , but did not , that another nice little dog now came along with nothing the matter with him except a few High Protection ideas in his head .

		.

		He also carried a nice shoulder of succulent mutton -LRB- wool , steel , and tin plate -RRB- , but he saw Prosperity in the stream and dived for it -LRB- McKinley Bill -RRB- , only to crawl out in a state of mind that almost made him doubt his existence .

		But it is refreshing to find a regular at this time avowing that the McKinley act '' was a high protective tariff dictated by the manufac - turers , '' declaring that '' the manufacturers have since persisted and insisted upon higher duties than they ought to have , '' and admitting his doubts of the ability of the Republicans to prove their contention that wages advanced and prices declined under the
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	law .

		If this is re - freshing , it is also amusing to find him rising at this late day to declare that not the
Sherman	PERSON	silver act , but the '' well-grounded fear of a free trade measure , '' was the cause of the panic of
1893	DATE	.

		This is simply the old party cry , raised by the Republicans at the time , and repeated with so much emphasis that many no doubt came to believe it true .

		No explanation is offered for the disappearance of the surplus , which was really due to reckless spending , pensions alone jumped from
$ 87,500,000	MONEY	to
$ 159,000,000	MONEY	under
Harrison	PERSON	, to prohibitive duties on some goods , and to free trade in revenue articles .

		The
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	law was such a beneficent mea - sure that the first thing the reputed author did after becoming President was to call an extra session for more like it ; and the result was the Dingley Act .

		`` The country , '' says Senator Cullom , '' was in such condition then that we heard no complaint concerning the high protec - tive tariff . ''

		That is the general policy of the protectionist to pile on as long as the country can endure it .

		But Senator Cullom probably forgets the little incident of the appearance of Mr.
Louis Brandeis	PERSON	, then a comparatively un - known man , who , in spite of ridicule from the committee , insisted on his right to be heard as a consumer .

		More consumers are now being heard .

		The law was passed ; and from that date , says the Senator , began the greatest era of prosperity , and the greatest national advancement , of any period of like duration in our history . ''


Ergo	ORGANIZATION	^ it was caused by the Dingley Act .

		There also followed a panic .

		Unfortunately , there was no '' well-grounded fear of a free-trade measure '' to make responsible for this , and the Senator offers no explanation .

		But the party weathered the storm , and tried a little more tariff tinkering the
Payne	PERSON	- Aldrich Act .

		Then came the deluge .

		`` I myself believe , '' says the Senator , `` that it was simply the result of the people becoming tired of too much prosperity under Republican administration . ''

		Very true , - only they are tired of too much prosperity for the privileged classes , and want a more equitable distribution of this prosperity .

		The tariff is still a live issue .

		So are at least two other questions in the development of which Senator Cullom really took an active part the regulation of interstate commerce and foreign affairs .

		In that part of his book dealing with these subjects , he has given us some things worth while to the student as well as to the casual reader .

		His is not the final word ; the reader may even feel that Senator Cullom might have done better , but , for all that , he will feel grateful for the new light thrown on these subjects .

		As is well known , Senator Cullom was the au - thor of the
Inter-State Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Act of
1887	DATE	.

		His service in
Illinois	LOCATION	had been in preparation for this event .

		A long series of abuses , which culminated in the
Granger	PERSON	movement and the passage of state laws to control the railroads , had interested him in the subject .

		Indeed , as Speaker of the
House	ORGANIZATION	he appointed the com - mittee which drafted the
Illinois	LOCATION	law of
1873	DATE	.

		But these state laws failed to bring the railroads to their senses , and the '' public be damned '' policy was continued .

		Some attention had been paid to the matter in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but nobody seems to have made any serious attempt at legislation .

		By the time Mr.
Cullom	PERSON	entered the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1883 -RRB- , he had become convinced that national regulation was the only solution ; and he soon began work on the matter .

		Early in
1885	DATE	he secured the passage of a resolution for the appointment of a committee to investigate the subject , and never let up on it until the act of
1887	DATE	had become a law .

		One clause that pro- hibiting pooling was inserted by Mr.
Reagan	PERSON	. ''

		Whether it was right or wrong , I do not know to this day , '' admits the Senator .

		In those days the railroad men were '' the most arrogant set of men in this country . ''

		At 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, first they treated the movement with contempt , hut when they saw that the bill was sure to pass they changed their attitude .

		After its passage they attacked one provision after another , and emasculated the act to a considerable extent through favorable decisions from the courts .

		Mr.
Cullom	PERSON	then endeavored to cure the defects , and introduced a bill for that purpose in
1889	DATE	, but was unable to secure its passage .

		In
1906	DATE	the
Hepburn	PERSON	act , embodying substantially the same principles , was adopted .

		This delay , he says , was due to the activity of the railroad men , who had packed the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	with men favorable to their interests an interesting admission from a `` regular '' !

		Since
1901	DATE	Senator Cullom has been Chair - man of the
Committee on Foreign Relations	ORGANIZATION	, in which capacity he has performed some notable services .

		Very little new light is thrown on the
Panama	LOCATION	affair , which is dismissed as '' the most remarkable revolution I have ever read of in history . ''

		It was remarkable indeed .

		The
Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	protocol is put in a new and slightly more favorable light by the publication of Mr.
Hay	PERSON	's letter explaining the origin of that famous document .

		Apparently the Senator does not accept the report on the arbitration treaties presented
last summer	DATE	by Senator Lodge in the name of the committee .

		The objection to the provision enabling the commission to consider whether any given question presented to it may be thought justiciable , he says , '' is based upon the theory that it would deprive the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of its constitutional right to pass upon all treaties .

		I have not accepted this view , because I do not believe in hampering working bodies when such a course can be avoided with - out doing violence to the fundamental law , as I believe in this case it can be . ''

		But our good friend Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	persists in his opposition , though on different grounds ; and now -LRB- `` The Outlook , ''
November 4	DATE	-RRB- draws upon ancient and modern history to prove his case .

		The ancient example is that when
Eugene	PERSON	of Savoy called upon de Boufflers to surrender , in
1708	DATE	, and allowed him to draw up the capitu - lation , he charged his enemy that nothing should be '' put in contrary to my honor and my duty . ''

		Turkey , he says , '' has all the protec - tion possible to give her by paper treaties ; and yet all these treaties guaranteeing her against dismemberment , thus pledging the honor of the various great nations to guarantee her integrity , are not worth as much as a single gunboat of the smallest size the minute that it becomes worth while for any serious opponent to attack her . ''

		If that be true , then why all this fuss about excluding questions touching honor , since the great nations do not appear to have any ?

		It is impossible to exclude something which does not exist .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's explanation is that the treaties are worthless because they promised too much .

		It may be that they promised more than they ought to have promised ; but that is not the chief difficulty , which is that no means were provided for their enforcement .

		We do not propose to promise too much in the arbitra - tion treaties , and certainly we do not intend to leave them without any means of enforcement .

		So we hope that Senator Cullom will be able to overcome a hostile majority in the committee , and find a two-thirds majority in the

		THE FRANZ HJSZT CENTENARY .

		* It was on the 22d of
October	DATE	, a hundred years ago , that
Franz Liszt	PERSON	, destined to extraordinary achievements in the realm of modern music , first opened his eyes to the light or darkness of this sublunary world .

		The little village of Raiding , near
Oedenburg	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	, was quite uncon - scious of the wonder-birth which had fallen to its share , and has never again ventured upon so startling a deviation from the even tenor of its way .

		The boy lisped in numbers , and he fortunately had a father who was an enthusiast in the art of music and could guide his adventur - ous footsteps .

		There was never a moment of doubt as to the talents of the son ; it was clear that in him music had gained a disciple whose genius and devotion would bring remarkable results .

		The youth received immediate recognition .

		Some Hungarian noblemen came to his assist - ance , for the family were not in affluent pecu - niary circumstances , and he was placed in charge of
Czerny	LOCATION	, the noted pupil of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		The veteran
Salieri	ORGANIZATION	consented to instruct him in counterpoint and harmony .

		At a concert which he gave in
Vienna	LOCATION	,
Beethoven	PERSON	was present , and the master ascended the stage and embraced the boy with paternal fervor .

		THE DIAL 395 succession of triumphs .

		He traversed
Europe	LOCATION	, and everywhere was recognized as the foremost of players on the piano an instrument which was then entering on its period of most pro- nounced development , with
Schumann	PERSON	and
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	and
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	disclosing its immense possibilities .

		Into this labor the strong and courageous Liszt threw himself with zeal , and the virtuosos of to-day know how great is their indebtedness to him .

		His experiences in the life of his period were deep and varied .

		He was a leader and a moulder of his era .

		He lived his early manhood amid the stirring events of literary and musical and political
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Art in all its forms ^ life with its myriad appeals , the great events and problems of the day , aroused in him an impassioned inter - est. .

		He was himself a litterateur of no mediocre rank ' .

		His utterance was fearless , impetuous , generous in appreciation , while strong and cour - ageous in giving to overestimated pretension the allotment which was its due .

		He belonged to the young and vigorous circle which numbered among its members George Sand and
Hein	PERSON	- rich
Heine	PERSON	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and
Hector Berlioz	PERSON	,
Frederic Chopin	PERSON	and
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	.

		The strange apparition of the violinist
Paganini	ORGANIZATION	made its impression upon him as upon the rest of his contemporaries , and his art received a dis - tinct forward impulse from the practice of the Italian .

		When he was ready to leave
Paris	LOCATION	, he had lived through this stage of his intellectual and spiritual development , and was ready for a new and nobler expansion of his powers .

		With his departure for
Germany	LOCATION	, and his setting up of his household gods in
Weimar	LOCATION	, began his higher creative activity .

		He accepted the position of Hofcapellmeister , and availed himself of its opportunities with his accustomed ardor .

		He could now exercise to the full that unenvious recognition of musicians whom the time had failed to understand , which is one of his chief glories , and which gives him a peren - nial place in the affection and gratitude of all devotees of the great art of music .

		It was at this time that he came so valiantly to the assist - ance of the
Wagner	PERSON	propagandists .

		He had the operas of the misunderstood master performed under his direction , and he paved the way for the successes which were to make
Bayreuth	LOCATION	illus - trious .

		He was the leader in every advance in music in his time .

		He had about him a band of fiery spirits , friends and pupils , who in all ways propagated the new ideas , and held out a welcoming hand to young and struggling com - posers .

		Berlioz ,
Raff	ORGANIZATION	,
Cornelius	PERSON	,
Sobolewski	PERSON	,
Rubenstein	PERSON	, all found in
Weimar	LOCATION	the sympathy and recognition which had been given to Wag - ner , and which they craved and needed as well as he .

		He finally left the city of
Schiller	PERSON	and Goethe for
Rome	LOCATION	, where he took orders in the Church , becoming the Abbe '' Liszt .

		His life had yet in store for him a series of triumphs in the great European cities in
London	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He witnessed the
Wagner	PERSON	productions at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, and he died there ,
July 31 , 1886	DATE	, full of honors and worthy of a recognition which has been slow to come , but which the centennial celebration just past has given in the measure in which it was deserved .

		For it has been the strange fate of Liszt to make in his earlier years so strong an impression of virtuosity on the piano that this reputation seems to have clung to him and overshadowed the fame as creative musician which was assuredly his in view of the orchestral works , the masses , the songs , the oratorios , which he has bequeathed to posterity .

		The great musical public of
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	has arrived at an appreciation of these works very gradually , and lesser composers have come to the front , while the older master re - mained in a sort of obscuration .

		It now seems as if an atonement were to be made for the neglect , and the Symphonic Poems , which heralded the progress , were to obtain the consideration which in the minds of the true connoisseurs has long been theirs .

		Liszt was a fearless captain in the musical revolution which reached its consummation in his time .

		Whatever meaning may be attached to the much-discussed and variously defined terms of Romantic and Classic , it became clear that music was accomplishing one of those great transitions which give to an art a fuller power of expression and a completer mastery of material and resources .

		Whatever form such a transi - tion may take , whether it be an apparent going back to an earlier time or a leap into the as yet unrealized future , the result is the same , a deeper envisagement of human possibilities , a finer art , and a surer control of the medium in which the artist works .

		It was in this effort that Liszt shone conspicuous ; his own innova - tions , his wide intellectual interests , his extra - ordinary sympathy with the achievements of others , his absolute freedom from envy and its consequent misappreciations , his heroic persist - ence in the presentation of the new and abused works of the new and abused composers , give him a unique place in musical history .

		His life was a consistent sacrifice to his art ; and even to this day the smoke of the battle appears to sur - 396 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, round his accomplishment , hiding it partially from view and preventing its just estimation .

		However , the signs are now apparent of a clearer and truer understanding , and works like `` Franz Liszt and his Music '' by Mr.
Arthur Hervey	PERSON	will do much in this direction .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	writes from that full knowledge of his subject which leaves no important point un - touched and which organizes the multifarious material into a consistent and vivid picture .

		He has the sympathy with his subject which a biographer should have , and his representation will , we are sure , be accepted among the final - ities about the composer .

		We will quote here a passage which we think very much in point . ''

		To attempt to give an idea of the influence exercised by
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	over other composers would require more space than I have at my disposal .

		Directly or indirectly , it asserts itself over the entire domain of modern program music .

		His creation of the Symphonic Poem has been fruitful to an extraordinary extent , and has brought into being examples from the pens of composers of all nationalities , while it has prepared the way for the more elaborate tone poems of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	.

		The principle of thematic unity so much prized by certain composers nowadays has been strikingly exemplified by Liszt in his Sonata and other works .

		Many are the harmonic subtleties and progressions which belong distinctly to him in the first place , but have since become public property .

		Does not his piano piece , ' Les Jeux d' eau a la Villa d'Este , ' in a way foreshadow the impression - ism of the modern French School ?

		Has not the peculiar mystical , and at the same time human , sentiment of his ' St.
Elizabeth	PERSON	' and '
Christus	PERSON	' placed another element at the disposal of the composer of sacred music ?

		But why say more ?

		With an extraordinary prophetic sense Liszt appears to have dipped into the future and antici - pated various forms of musical expression now current , and his influence over music generally has been greater than it has been possible to measure . ''

		Liszt began life as a dazzling player upon the piano , and his compositions during this period of his career transcriptions , consolations , etudes , rhapsodies display the varied character of his experiences , and , however brilliant , remain true and sincere to the content which they embody .

		Later , during his
Weimar	LOCATION	epoch , he gave up the triumphs and emoluments of the successful virtuoso , and poured forth the abund - ance of his orchestral productions the Sym - phonic Poems , his
Dante	PERSON	and
Faust	PERSON	compositions , his concertos and his songs , and in these is found a series of works which in the estimation of those who believe in him give him a sure hold upon posterity .

		Last of all , when the tumults of a career not readily parallelled had melted into a noble calm , he gave his toilsome hours to his religious music , toward which his inclinations had long been turning .

		Liszt belongs among the leading figures of his time and generation , with
Schumann	PERSON	and
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	in music ; with
George Sand	PERSON	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Lamartine	PERSON	, and
Heine	PERSON	, in thought and sentiment ; with Pre Lamenais in his religious enthusiasm , which afterwards assumed a more orthodox form .

		He had a strange and check - ered career , but the best of his work , brilliant in color , impassioned in utterance , hopeful in outlook , has elements of permanence , and bids fair to belong to those splendors which mankind places in its enduring treasure-house .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's book is commendable in all ways ; he is indeed a partisan , but not off en - si vely so .

		If he is inclined , perhaps , to give Liszt a more important place than can right - fully be claimed for him , the fault may be pardoned in a centennial biography , and may be considered a leaning to the right side ; for it is now imperative that justice should be done the composer , and Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's book will help on in that endeavor .

		The general reader can find no better account of Liszt .

		Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	's life of Liszt is a remarkable production .

		It is written in the author 's well-known manner , brilliant , incisive , comprehensive .

		It has been a labor of many years .

		The book was projected and announced in
1902	DATE	; the author states that he had been collecting
Lisztiana	PERSON	for a quarter of a century .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	is an established authority in matters musical , and the volume shows knowl - edge , research , and acumen .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	has called to his aid all the important writers on
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, and we see the subject from many differ - ent points of view , which enable us to form a verified estimate of him .

		The player , like the actor at least in part can leave no satis - factory memorial of the highest reach of his attainment ; we must depend on the differenced accounts of the listener .

		Fortunately for
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, his playing is the least part of his claim to re - membrance .

		One sees how encyclopaedic Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's account is : he tells of Liszt the man , of his art and character , of his work as a com - poser , of his life at Home ,
Weimar	LOCATION	,
Budapest	LOCATION	; he shows us Liszt mirrored by his contem - poraries , a great collection of critiques and estimates .

		He follows in the footsteps of Liszt , and describes from actual visitation his haunts and abiding places ; he gives an account of his great pupils , and of the modern players who have followed the paths indicated by the won - derful forerunner ; he illuminates the subject everywhere by his vigorous style , his familiarity with musical affairs , and by his genuine insight .

		We may quote one of his picturesque statements .

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 ''
Liszt	PERSON	's music is virile and komophonic despite its chromatic complexities .

		Instead of lacking in thematic intention he was , perhaps , a trifle too facile , too Italianate .

		... Liszt was less the master builder than the painter ; color , not form , was his stronger side .

		... In musician - ship Liszt had no contemporary who could pretend to tie his shoestrings , with the possible exception of
Felix Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	.

		And in one particular he ranks next to
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	in rhythmic invention ; after
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, Liszt stands nearest as regards the variety of his rhythms .

		His Eastern blood the Magyar came from
Asia	LOCATION	may account for this rhythmic versatility .

		It is a point not to be overlooked in future estimates . ''

		No student of Liszt should fail to make the acquaintance of this book .

		It contains much bibliographical information , has a copious index , is admirably printed , and has many and inter - esting illustrations .

		THE FERRERESQUE STYLE OF WRITING HISTORY .

		*
Signer Ferrero	PERSON	's new book on '' The Women of the Caesars '' may be described , in brief , as Ferreresque : clever , vivacious , unabashed in its dashing attacks on views that have held the ground for centuries , always interesting , and always plausible .

		In his first chapter , on '' Woman and Mar - riage in Ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, ''
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	dwells at some length on the contradiction that strikes the attention of those who become at all ac - quainted with the life of the Roman nobility on the one hand , the almost unlimited freedom of the Roman lady , and her approximate equal - ity with man , and on the other the constraint actually laid upon her .

		The explanation of the contradiction is to be looked for in the force of the strong Puritan tradition which for all the centuries had demanded of the Roman matron industry , frugality , obedience , chastity , self - abnegation , and complete devotion to family and state , and had made her one of the world 's supreme examples of womanhood .

		Her power for the good of the society in which she moved was extraordinary , and the very fact multiplied the influence of her slightest deviation from the path of absolute rectitude .

		This is why the women of the Caesars appear so prominently in the history of early imperial times .

		The key with which
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	unlocks the door to the mysteries of conduct among the imperial ladies and gentlemen is politics .

		From Livia the wife of Augustus to Agrippina the * THE WOMEN OF THE C ^ ESAKS .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		mother of
Nero	ORGANIZATION	, with few exceptions , political ambition , often elevated into patriotic devotion , is the mainspring of action , even when the action is unwise .

		Personal inclination has little to do with imperial marriage .

		Even
Augustus	PERSON	's hasty wooing of
Livia	LOCATION	, involving her sudden divorce from
Tiberius Claudius Nero	PERSON	, attributed in the '' Greatness and Decline of
Rome	LOCATION	'' to passion , is seen by the historian , in the light of more careful consideration , to have been due merely to the calculating Emperor 's desire to establish his position by allying to him the ancient and influential house of the Claudii .

		Having found the key ,
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	plies it with industry and effect .

		Most of the doors fly open with the greatest promptness , and the remaining few yield after a little manipulation .

		The evidence of the ancient writers , who might be presumed to know something about the events of their own time , is the main obstacle to the use of the bright little instrument ; but it is , after all , a matter of no very great difficulty to con - vict them of ignorance and prejudice .

		Tacitus is '' malignant , '' and '' clouded by undiscerning antipathy . '' ''

		It seems almost a crime , '' says the acute modern chronicler of the Julian ladies , '' that posterity should virtually always have studied and pondered the immense tragedy of history on the basis of the crude and superficial falsification of it which Tacitus has given us . ''

		We are left to draw the charitable conclusion , however , that it is not quite a crime , for poster - ity is not wholly responsible for its fault .

		Most historians , says
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	, are '' halluci - nated by Tacitus . ''

		Knowing the author 's attitude toward
Taci	PERSON	- tus , the reader will not be surprised when he is told that
Tiberius	PERSON	was not a gloomy , jealous tyrant , but a much misunderstood patriot caught in the cogs of circumstance .

		Agrippina did not crave imperial power for the gratification of her ambition ; quite the contrary , she sacrificed her - self in marriage to a stupid , difficult , and un - pleasant old man , because she saw that the Emperor was in desperate need of a consort of the good old Roman fashion like herself .

		She did not secure the adoption of Nero by
Claudius	PERSON	because she wished her son one day to wear the purple , but because she wished to minimize the likelihood of disturbance in the
State	ORGANIZATION	through lack of rulers by giving the im - perial family two chances for the succession , in - stead of one .

		She did not poison
Claudius	PERSON	; and at his death she did not have Nero made Em - peror because she loved the son of Claudius less , but
Rome	LOCATION	more .

		Nero was seventeen , and Bri - 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, tannicus thirteen ; and she proposed
Nero	PERSON	to the praetorians and
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, not because she pre - ferred her own son to the son of Claudius , but because she feared that if Britannicus were put forward as a claimant he would be refused on account of his youth , and the family would lose its representation on the throne altogether .

		Whether the reader accepts all of
Ferrero	PERSON	's interpretations or not , he is always interested in them .

		There are no dull pages in the book , though there are wordy pages with a superficial ring , and once in a while an expression which is barely English .

		The imperial actors stand forth clearly , and the panorama of ancient life moves briskly .

		The narrative reads like a novel .

		Listen to this : `` But now , stepping forward suddenly from the shadows to which she had retired , a lady appeared , threw herself between the two contestants , and changed the fate of the combat .

		It was
Antonia	PERSON	, the daughter of the famous triumvir , the revered widow of Drusus . ''

		It is not impossible that a search in Tacitus might result in the discovery of this , but it is more probably
Signer Ferrero	PERSON	's own picturesque manner of describing the situation .

		Not every picturesque passage , however , is to be traced to the modern author 's lively vision . ''

		It was a calm , starry night '' sounds like a sentence from romance , but
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	actually says it -LRB- XIV .

		5 -RRB- and
Ferrero	PERSON	does not dispute him .

		In short , if the reader is not `` hallucinated by
Ferrero	PERSON	, '' it is because he shrinks from assuming in every case that what was likely to have taken place actually did take place .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	- ^ T ''
Edward Thomas	PERSON	, whose life of poet , mv flic ,
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	is remembered as and dramatitt .

		a w ' ^ an -LRB- j yj n -LRB- j dithyramb , has done a creditable and useful piece of writing in his volume on
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Some of the faults of the earlier book do indeed reappear : a tendency to quote frequently and at length , not only his author , but also a whole galaxy of authors who have little or nothing to do with the matter in hand ; a tendency to revert , now and again , to the pseudo-mystical murkiness and mistaken gusto that spoiled his book on
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	.

		But these faults have been so nearly mastered that it is ungenerous and perhaps unjust to mention them at all .

		The book is not a life of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	his uneventful life is dismissed with the eighteenth page .

		The rest of the three hundred pages are devoted to an exposition and casual appraisement of his numerous plays , poems , and essays , from `` Serres Chaudes '' to
Mary Magdalene	PERSON	. ''

		The value of the book lies mainly in the expository chapters , which are often unusually lucid and skilful though it is somewhat disconcerting to read half of the quotations in French and half in English .

		In its critical aspects , the book is not so satisfactory ; for although the judgments are usually sober enough -LRB- the glamor and attenuated feeling of the '' Tresor '' essays and of the early plays are discussed with an apologetic tone rather than with unbounded enthusiasm -RRB- , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	does not often commit himself , and when he does he some - times contradicts himself .

		Thus , he writes that
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's is a voice for the people to hearken to , it is so clear and simple ; and later he writes that he has a '' vague intangibility . ''

		Again ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is throughout the book called a mystic ; but at the close he turns out to be a '' rhetorician '' rather than a '' mystic , '' '' though he deals in mystical ideas . ''

		These confusions , particularly the latter , are the more unfortunate in that they involve matters of funda - mental importance , for does not Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	him - self say that ''
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is the first ' mystic ' to appear in an age of science '' ?

		Similarly , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	fails to realize what he implies when he says that `` he has only failed to create a human char - acter . ''

		If
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is anything , he is a writer of plays ; and what is a writer of plays who '' has failed to create a human character '' ?

		If
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck has the logic of the Frenchman as well as the sagacity of the Belgian , these things will surely amuse him .

		The
Maeterlinck	PERSON	of the present day , according to Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	, is a man who has emerged from the mysterious twilight of the North into the light and warmth of the South ; an optimist who accepts our civilization as it is , and looks forward , not to a mystical reawakening of the soul , but to evolutionary development ; a man who '' explains nothing , but is afraid of nothing , and unashamed of being baffled . ''

		For most readers , one is rather surprised to hear Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	admit , '' he is not bracing , and probably fosters a combination of tolerance and enlightened inactivity . ''

		Verily , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	is no longer the rapturous mystic of the Jefferies book , but a man spiritually unsettled -LRB- per - haps through the effects of reading Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	's `` New LaokoOn , '' quoted on page 164 -RRB- , and on the way to a sober interpretation of life .

		THE DIAL 399 perhaps all lands , to its doors .

		Modern developments in rapid transportation have done much to override the physical barriers which isolate peoples and civ - ilizations , but the printing-press and the telegraph do far more to remove the subtler hindrances to the interchange of ideas and the intermingli ng of the peo - ples of the earth .

		In reading Miss
Ellen Churchill Semple	PERSON	's '' Influences of Geographic Environment '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- one feels very pointedly the need of a chap - ter which should adequately set forth the present - day tendency toward the elimination of geographic environment as a predominant factor in man 's evolu - tion , by the discoveries of modern science .

		Her work is replete with a detailed analysis , on the basis of the late Professor
Friedrich Ratzel	PERSON	's system of anthropo-geography , of the relations of the configu - ration of the earth to the evolution of human civil - ization , in other words , of geography to history .

		The German master was a follower of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, in his emphasis upon the action of the environment upon the course of human development .

		The present work is less dogmatic in this matter of the organic theory of society and the state , though following in the main the outline of the German original .

		The underlying motive of the work is still the biological interpretation of history the pressure of the environment as a moulding force in human action , just as it is in the distribution and differentia - tion of palms and rabbits .

		One finds much , in its pages , of location , area , boundaries ; of coasts as transition zones , and coastal conditions as determin - ers of ethnic amalgamations ; of seas , rivers , pen - insulas , and islands ; of plains , steppes , and deserts ; of mountain barriers and passes , and of climate as potent factors in shaping the course and limiting or impelling the social and ethnic career of peoples and nations .

		There is , however , insufficient recognition of another biological aspect of the problem , namely , of the factor of heredity , a counterfoil here as else - where in the living world to the effect of environ - mental factors .

		In the higher levels and later stages of human evolution , the potency of great leaders and of the influence of ideas are powerful agencies in the control of human action .

		To the biologist and historian , the work is of unusual interest .

		The treatment is exhaustive , and the references to orig - inal sources abundant and of wide range .

		Another book Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	has given us a about the chatty and readable story of '' The Brownings .

		Brownings , Their Life and Art '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		So much has already been published about these two poets that another book should show some good reason for being .

		The preface informs us that the author has had the '' cordial assent and sympathetic encouragement of
Robert Barrett Browning	PERSON	'' ; also that she has had access to a collection of letters written by
Robert Browning	PERSON	to Mrs.
Bronson	PERSON	.

		There does not seem , however , to be any great value in these hitherto un - published letters .

		Mrs.
Bronson	PERSON	was evidently a cordial and gracious hostess , and
Browning	PERSON	's letters to her were those of a grateful and affectionate guest .

		But they deal with trifling matters , and throw no new light on the man or his work .

		Miss
Whiting	PERSON	goes cheerily on her flowery way , repeat - ing the old stories of previous biographers even some which have long since been discredited .

		On one point , however , she has acquired original in - formation .

		She is able to correct the generally accepted account that Mr.
Browning	PERSON	first saw and named the '' Sonnets from the Portuguese '' at
Pisa	LOCATION	during the first year of his married life .

		Mr.
Barrett Browning	PERSON	has furnished her this extract from a letter written by his father : '' The sonnets were only known to exist , and seen for the first time by the person to whom they were addressed , two or three years after the writer 's marriage .

		This was at
Bagni di Lucca	ORGANIZATION	, after the birth of our child a few months before .

		The poems were only printed at my earnest entreaty . ''

		Two letters to
Kate Field	ORGANIZATION	, one from Mr.
Browning	PERSON	and one from Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, are new and well worth while .

		`` Browning the husband , '' as he now calls him - self , assures Miss Field of his pleasure that she -LRB- alone in all
Florence	LOCATION	-RRB- has had the insight to discover that Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's '' Curse for a Nation '' was written for
America	LOCATION	and not for
England	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	reports having received a letter from
America	LOCATION	, `` from somebody who , hearing I was in ill health , desired to inform me that he would n't weep for me , were it not for
Robert Browning	PERSON	and Penini . ''

		Miss
Whiting	PERSON	's reportorial instinct carries her beyond the bounds of good taste in frequent and fulsome allusions to
Robert Barrett Browning	PERSON	and the titled ladies born of American parents
Marchesa Peruzzi	PERSON	di ' Medici -LRB- ndta Story -RRB- and
Contessa Rucellai	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- ndta
Bronson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		There is no little carelessness in the spelling of Italian names : '' Lurici '' for
Lerici	LOCATION	; `` Franceschino '' for
Franceschini	PERSON	; '' Prato Fiortito '' -LRB- in three places -RRB- for
Fiorito	PERSON	.

		The volume is beau - tifully printed , illustrated , and bound ; doubtless it will prove popular with the general reader , even though it adds little to the already existing biog - raphies of the two Brownings .

		The climax of Professor
Flournoy	PERSON	's volume on the undesirable '' Spiritism and Psychology '' -LRB- Har - in psychology , per -RRB- , though large , is a condensa - tion of a very much fuller work in the French , and its scope covers recent investigation in the field of that department of k ' psychical research '' which deals with mediums and their varied manifestations .

		Taken as a whole , the book is distinctly confusing , misleading , and even pernicious .

		Neither the repu - tation of its author , nor the evident ability in hand - ling his data , nor the inclusion of meritorious investigations of his own , can offset the logical im - perfections of his attitude .

		It is a case where con - tributory negligence amounts almost to crime .

		There is a slurring of the logic at the beginning , which fatally diverges , as the argument proceeds , from truth , to half-truth , to broad error .

		Professor
Flournoy	PERSON	's investigations might well have taken the 400 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Intending to be open-minded on the latter issue , he presently confuses vague theoretic possibili - ties with practical probabilities , and in the end com - mits himself as unreservedly to an illogical belief in the so-called '' genuineness '' of these phenomena as the crudest partisan might have done at the out - set .

		It is this mingling of academic scholarship and psychological insight with a lack of logical founda - tions , that makes the book unfortunate .

		The logical fallacy may be brought home by a story which is told of various peoples amongst whom a gift of '' second - sight '' is a common belief .

		To test one so gifted , who professed to tell what was going on in a village a few miles away , it was proposed that a man ride over to the village and report as to the truth of this long - distance vision .

		The messenger returned with the report that So-and-so , who at that particular hour was described as engaged in a certain place in a certain occupation , was at the designated hour elsewhere , and not at all engaged as appeared in the vision .

		The negative report by no means discouraged his partis - ans , who replied , '' Well , he did n't see very accurate - ly : but is n't it wonderful enough that he should see so far ? ''

		Professor
Flournoy	PERSON	describes '' deceiving spirits '' who failed to see accurately , and '' benefi - cent spirits '' who happened to hit it right , or re - mained undetected .

		The exposition of
Paladino	ORGANIZATION	is regarded as incidental , and as in no way interfering with the possibility indeed , with the '' genuine - ness '' of such of her performances as escaped de - tection .

		The association of psychology with spiritism has been unfortunate from the first , but may well be said to have reached the climax of the undesirable in the present volume .

		If the world does not learn what Banner of man
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	was , it will not be for lack of ma - terial upon which to base opinion .

		The Japanese view presented by
Yone Noguchi	PERSON	in ``
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	in
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	-RRB- , puts the dis - tinguished writer 's personality in a very agreeable light .

		It is not solely the verdict of the author that the reader is asked to accept .

		Besides reprinting his `` Japanese Appreciation '' of Hearn which first appeared in the `` Atlantic Monthly , '' and his im - passioned `` Defence '' of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	from Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's imputations , which was originally published in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Sun '' and the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Times , '' he gives several chapters of recollections by people who were intimately associated with
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of these the reminiscences of Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	will be read with the deepest interest .

		Noguchi believes that her in - fluence upon
Hearn	PERSON	was very strong . ''

		It is not a daily occurrence , even in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' he assures us , '' to see such a woman , whose sweetness of old samurai heart still burns beautifully as a precious incense ris - ing from a holy shrine . ''

		In her narration she dwells upon such things as her husband 's love for his fam - ily and home , his attachment to every tree and flower in his garden , his tender regard for all living crea - tures , his delight in travel , and his life-hobby or doraku as the Japanese call it which was the col - lecting of Japanese pipes that made a sentimental appeal to him .

		Little glimpses of his domestic life reveal it as of most exquisite quality . ''

		I have , '' says Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	, '' a most beautiful memory of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	in his understanding and attitude toward women . ''

		He had the keenest sympathy for the people about him , especially those in humble life .

		The old fish - erman of Yaidzu , at whose house he spent many summers , said of him that he was the only perfect man he ever came across , and if we may accept the testimony offered in this volume ,
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's students held him in the highest esteem and felt for him affectionate regard .

		It is the finer side of his char - acter that Mr.
Noguchi	PERSON	shows us .

		The book is printed in
Kamakura	LOCATION	, and , quite appropriately , is bound in Japanese style .

		`` Scientific ^ r * ^ '
Addington Bruce	PERSON	, who has mental healing , '' published two popular works upon and other things .

		o b scure phases of mental phenomena , adds a third to the group , under the general title of '' Scientific Mental Healing '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is , indeed , its main subject , though it branches over into considerations of secondary personality , of the applications of psychology to law and business , and concludes with a personal appreciation of Wil - liam
James	PERSON	.

		The volume is , in general , a very suc - cessful popularization , and is so because its author has selected topics capable of popular , possibly even of sensational , exposition ; yet the tone is reserved , and for the reader who wishes and expects a read - able account of some of the most unusual abnormal phenomena in psychology , the book is well designed .

		It goes into nothing very deeply , presents no new insight , and must of course be somewhat '' out of centre '' as a reflection of the actual interest of psy - chologists in these themes .

		It is , in a sense , unfor - tunate that popularization must throw the portrayal of present-day science so seriou & ly out of perspective as is the case in psychology .

		This is due to the ingrained tendency toward mystery , and a certain ancient human inheritance that emphasizes the im - portance of personally interesting experiences .

		With due allowance for the very frank catering to these interests , the book proceeds to satisfy this natural curiosity with a less measure of misconception than is usual , and with a more than usual insight in the selection of reliable and well-interpreted cases .

		Men and events With socialism for his dominant in - of the last ha if of terest , and travel , journalism , and the i9th century - miscellaneous writing for his minor occupations , with apparently enough of worldly wealth to relieve him from want , and with the happy knack of making friendships with various sorts of men in all quarters of the globe , Mr.
Henry	PERSON
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401
Mayers Hyndman	PERSON	appears , from his autobiographi - cal volume `` The Record of an Adventurous Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to have derived no little enjoyment from his seven decades of multifarious activity ; and his wish to share his experiences with the reading public has resulted in a narrative of rather brisk and stirring quality .

		Covering the middle and later nine - teenth century , his book affords passing glimpses of many celebrities of the period in both
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Here is his characterization of Mazzini : '' Simple , unaffected and direct , with a complete vol - cano of energy and passion and enthusiasm under - lying this seeming quietude of manner ,
Mazzini	PERSON	gained his influence over men by sheer devotion to his cause , unfailing enthusiasm and courage , and the absence , or so I thought , of any appearance of dic - tation . ''

		Noteworthy is his passing reference to `` the monstrous tyranny of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	and his Whigs in
Ireland	LOCATION	and their equally abominable policy in
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		There is material enough for warm de - bate in Mr.
Hyndman	PERSON	's pages , if one cares to get heated .

		A century Mr ' Re y nold w -
Jeffery	PERSON	's volume of history on '' The
New Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , all compact .

		covering the century 1789-1889 , is a compilation prepared apparently for the use of schools .

		While it is as compact a volume as is consistent with its comprehensive title , additional tables and diagrams , generous footnotes , and bib - liographies , are so placed as to simplify the study and assist the memory .

		There are fourteen geneal - ogical tables , nearly as many diagrams visualizing cause and effect in the sequence of events , bibliog - raphies at the end of each chapter as well as one for the book , a table of contemporaneous events in
England	LOCATION	appended to at least half the chapters , a series of maps , and many footnotes .

		The latter are practically all biographical sketches of the briefest sort , so that the student escapes any great personal effort .

		Indeed , the general plan of the volume seems to be to offer the greatest amount of facts with the least possible effort to acquire them .

		One may question whether history so carefully predi - gested and tabulated is likely to appeal strongly to the student .

		The method doubtless makes for rapid acquisition , but facts easily acquired are often rela - tively difficult of retention , unless the presentation is unusually forcible and vivid .

		The book will un - questionably be valuable as a convenient reference work , thanks to the supplementary tables and dia - grams , and to its very complete index .

		BRIEFER MENTION .


Elizabeth Gibson	PERSON	-LRB- now the wife of the distinguished Biblical scholar , Prof.
T. K. Cheyne	PERSON	of
Oxford Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity -RRB- is the author of numerous booklets , very attract - ively printed , in both prose and poetry .

		They range in size from 30 to 40 pages .

		These are not essays or nar - ratives , or sketches , but collections of brief statements : suggestions and meditations , with fine spiritual in - sight , helpful thoughts respecting life , full of wisdom and comfort .

		The style is beautiful and the teaching uplifting .

		These are some of the titles : `` Fruits of the Valley , '' '' Blossoms of Peace , '' '' Welling of Waters . ''

		They may be had of the author , 17
Parke Road	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some American publisher would do well to handle them , as they are admirably calculated to be used as gift booklets .

		The many striking poems on President
Lincoln	PERSON	offer a tempting field to the anthologist , and Mr.
A. Dallas Williams	PERSON	has made a creditable and interesting collec - tion , issued by the
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with the title '' In Praise of Lincoln . ''

		It contains , as far as we have noted , all the best-known poems on Lincoln that have appeared , with others that readers will be glad to have in this association .

		The poetic level of the volume is on the whole surprisingly high .

		Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, the veteran editor and author , whose books for children now number two hundred titles , starts bravely on his third hundred with a volume for the present season entitled '' Stories , Books , Plays , and Biographies . ''

		It is a portly volume of some 500 pages , containing stories of all nations , the hero and folk stories of all ages , stories of the famous plays , stories of the famous books , and stories of the world 's great men and women .


Chicago	LOCATION	's educational facilities in the form of schools and colleges and universities , libraries and museums , art galleries , music societies , lecture associations , culture clubs , and numerous other organizations , form the sub - ject of an eighty - page illustrated pamphlet , `` Educa - tional Opportunities in
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' prepared and freely distributed by the
Council for Library	ORGANIZATION	and Museum Ex - tension , of which Mr.
N. H. Carpenter	PERSON	of the Art Insti - tute is president , and Mr.
Aksel G. S. Josephson	PERSON	of the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	is secretary .

		With the appearance of '' Aglavaine and Selysette , '' the
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	series of translations from
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is virtually complete .

		Nothing need be said at this time of Mr.
Alfred Sutro	PERSON	's well-known and gen - erally admirable gift of translation .

		To this latest vol - ume in the series Mr.
Sutro	PERSON	has prefixed a chapter of gos - sip and enthusiasm that is highly entertaining -LRB- thanks to his boundless gusto -RRB- rather than thoughtful . ''

		Pelle'as '' is '' that rare little masterpiece , '' the '' Blue Bird '' is profound '' without puzzling or bewildering either adults or children '' ; `` Aglavaine and SeUysette '' is epitomized in the sentence , '' Ah , the strange , pathetic little play , so full of beauty and tenderness ! ''

		and '' contains a heart - rending scene as effective as any other in all literature . ''

		One is compelled to agree with Mr.
Sutro	PERSON	's modest avowal that he possesses '' no sort of critical faculty . ''

		Mr.
Bolton Hall	PERSON	has written a garrulous book on '' Sleep '' which at all events will not keep the reader un - duly awake .

		The Gift of Sleep '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a case of a book made to the order of an interest un - supported by insight or special knowledge .

		The theme is treated discursively , digressively , and divertingly ; yet it may well be doubted whether there is any need of or demand for this manner of treatment of this type of subject .

		The treatment extends beyond its primary top - ic to include general advice of the '' Do n't worry '' or - der , embodying the superficial optimism in favor with those unaware of the antiquity of `` new '' thought .

		The seeking of bliss in ignoring and in ignorance will pres - ently spend its force ; and the enduring values of knowledge will assert their unlapsed claim .

		Under such auspices we shall have better advisory counsel on the conduct of waking occupations and of recuperation alike .

		An unusually interesting meeting of the
Massachu	PERSON	- setts
Library Club	ORGANIZATION	was held at
New Bedford	LOCATION	,
Oct. 25	DATE	.

		The fine new building of the local public library , a struc - ture costing
$ 275,000	MONEY	, and apparently well worth the outlay , was the scene of the gathering , and its librarian , Mr.
Rowland Tripp	PERSON	, author of '' In Whaling Days , '' delivered the chief address , on the subject , '' Literature under the Whaling Industry . ''

		A clam-bake luncheon at
Fort Phoenix	LOCATION	,
Fairhaven	LOCATION	, and an inspection of Fair - haven 's beautiful library , the gift of the late
Henry H. Rogers	PERSON	to his native town , contributed no little to the pleasure of the occasion .

		A '' Viking Edition '' of

Howard Pyle	PERSON	, the American artist and author , died in
London	LOCATION	, on the
9th of this month	DATE	, at the age of fifty - eight .

		Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	came early into notice as a magazine illustrator , in which field he developed a striking and characteristic style , especially in color work .

		He car - ried the same originality into the illustration of his own books , many of which were for children , and attained a wide popularity . ''

		New Poems by
James I.	PERSON	of

George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence with the officials of the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	, which sent him on that memorable tour of
Spain	LOCATION	to extend the sale of the Bible in that priest - ridden land , was discovered a few years ago among the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's archives , and is to be published soon under the editorship of the
Reverend T. H. Darlow	PERSON	, Literary Superintendent of the Society .

		New light on Borrow 's picturesque personality is promised from these letters .

		In the second posthumous work of
William James	PERSON	, just issued by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title `` Memories and Studies , '' is inserted a card from Mr.
Henry James , Jr.	PERSON	, announcing the collection of his distinguished father 's letters for biographical purposes . ''

		Casual or brief letters may have an interest or import - ance not apparent to the person possessing them , '' he says , '' and news of the whereabouts of any of the late
William James	PERSON	's letters will be gratefully received . ''

		The rapid growth of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library in recent years is attested by the issue of a new edition of '' De - scriptive and Historical Notes of the Library of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, '' in the general series of '' Bibliographical contributions , '' edited by the librarian , Mr.
William Coolidge Lane	PERSON	.

		Twenty new subjects have been found worthy of notice in this later edition , which follows the earlier after only eight years ; but even in that short time the library has grown by the addition of 164,000 volumes . ''

		The
New York	LOCATION	Medical Journal '' of
October 14	DATE	calls attention , editorially , to
Planche	PERSON	`` s once popular play , '' Not a Bad Judge , '' as containing in its hero ,
John Caspar Lavater	PERSON	-LRB- a character modelled after the German physiognomist of that name -RRB- , a forerunner of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, whose exploits just now are being recalled in connection with the death of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	's one-time instructor , Dr.
Joseph Bell	PERSON	, who is supposed to have furnished the novelist with the first suggestion of his famous detective .

		That
Planche	PERSON	' , instead , gave this first suggestion is of course not impos -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 sible , any more than it is impossible that
Voltaire	PERSON	did so with his '' Zadig , '' or any one of a number of writers on inductive philosophy .

		But Bell was nearer in time and space than anyone else named in this connection , and unless the author chooses to deny the allegation let us rest content with holding that Dr.
Bell	PERSON	is the original of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	.

		Another legislative reference library has come into being .

		An offshoot of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, to be known as the
Municipal Reference Branch	ORGANIZATION	, and hav - ing quarters in the
City Hall	LOCATION	, lately opened its doors to the public . ''

		With the establishment of the Municipal Reference Branch , '' writes Mr.

State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	, has charge of this new and promising depart - ment of

Dec. 1	DATE	, YOUR HERITAGE as a free individual has been the theme of phil - osophers since history began .

		During the centuries , men of far-seeing minds prophets , seers , have declared for a wider , richer freedom .

		Political economists , socialists , anarchists , have added a grain here or there ; but the `` schemes '' have , in the main , been of the tissue of dreams .

		It is good to meet with an uplifting and upbuilding work that is vitally practical ; that declares with fervor and backs with logic , tenets of new social conditions : that shows us the fallacies and absurdities of our present day civilization and government : that unearths the very root-causes of our present '' social unrest `` and then , withal , goes one step further and suggests a remedy .

		Such a book is By
RITTER BROWN	PERSON	It is calculated to attract and hold the interest of the reader , and to bring about a sane discussion .

		Whatever the reader 's personal opinions may be on the subjects involved , he can not but be impressed by the quiet conviction with which it is written , and the moderation of tone employed throughout .

		The publishers believe it will quickly commend itself to the public .

		IN PROFESSOR CORNILL we have one of the most scholarly professors of Old Testament Theology , and at the same time a man of unusual devotion and Christian piety .

		Among the higher critics he is recognized as a leader , and having attained his results almost in spite of his own preferences , presents them with great delicacy and with unusual sympathy for the tra - ditional interpretation . ''

		An accomplished and conscientious scholar , and of a > truly religious spirit . ''

		The Outlook . ''

		It is good that the church should take an interest in the past and especially good when the present is so full of pressing questions and living issues .

		There have been times when the church has been prone to live too much on the past but those were not times when the significance of that past was most clearly understood ; it was not the living past to which intelligent homage was paid but a dead past petrified into hard dogmas that were worshiped .

		In our own time it is from the men of ` science ' even more than from the theologians that the message concerning the meaning of the past has been expressed with greatest force .

		It is possible for us all now to take a large , comprehensive view of great world-movements . ''

		492 SHAKESPEARE THROUGH FRENCH EYES .

		In providing for an annual lecture on Shake - speare , the new
British Academy	ORGANIZATION	has assumed an obvious obligation , and taken at least one of the steps needed to justify its existence .

		Nor could it have done better for the inauguration of this lectureship than to invite
M. Jusserand	PERSON	to be the first of its series of speakers .

		The French Ambassador to the
United States	LOCATION	has in his own time done what
Taine	PERSON	did half a cen - tury ago : he has well-nigh put English scholar - ship to blush by the solidity of his knowledge of our literature , and by the sympathetic powers of exposition which he has applied to the task of increasing our acquaintance with our own intel - lectual heritage .

		In his Shakespearean lecture of
last July	DATE	, as now reported and published , he has approached his subject with just the degree of detachment needed to make the most hack - neyed of subjects seem almost fresh .

		We are all the time made conscious of two facts : that he is a foreigner , and that his title is clear to engage in the discussion of our own great poet .

		Gracefully quoting from
Swinburne	LOCATION	's well - known passage about the sorts of boats '' from 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the paltriest fishing craft to such majestic galleys as were steered by
Coleridge	PERSON	and by Goethe '' that have ventured upon the un - sounded sea of Shakespearean research , he apolo - gizes for his own expedition in these happy words : '' For an occasion like the present no galley could be too great or too majestic .

		If it pleased you to select the merest fishing craft , the reason must be that , to come to you , it had to cross the ocean , and this doubt - less humored the fancy of a sporting nation .

		As soon , however , as your invitation reached me , I accepted it , thinking that the best courtesy was not to discuss but to obey , and considering that , for lack of better motives , my coming from the lands further away than ' vexed
Bermoothes	PERSON	' was an homage I could offer which was not within the reach of many of my betters . ''

		`` What to Expect of Shakespeare '' is the title of
M. Jusserand	PERSON	's address , and he indi - cates in a common-sense fashion a few of the things which are not to be expected things which have led many students , because expect - ing them , to flounder in metaphysical bogs , and read into the plays all sorts of aesthetic subtleties and intentions which are simply not there .

		He wrote readily , not groaning in intellectual travail after the manner of
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and , in the words of his fellow players , '' what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him a blot in his pa - pers . ''

		He wrote plays to be acted , to attract audiences , to appeal to the groundlings as well as to the refined , and to produce for their author a competency upon which he might retire to
Stratford	LOCATION	and end his days as a gentleman . ''

		The idea of his being held later the Merlin of unborn times , the revealer of the unknown , the leader of men of thought and feeling , the life - giver , the pride of his country , never occurred to him , and would probably have made him laugh . ''

		We can not go quite as far as
M. Jusserand	PERSON	in asserting that the poet was unconscious of his own genius , for we can not dismiss the testimony of the sonnets as a mere literaryyhpoTi deparler \ but we may readily admit that in the main his aims were practical , but that he did his jour - neyman work in a spirit which would seem to the average third-rate poet of modern times to denote a lack of self-respect .

		He was not afraid to make himself '' a motley to the view , '' pro- vided only he could succeed in delighting his audiences .

		That Shakespeare has since become all those things to all men that he had little idea of be - coming is a tribute to the discernment of poster - ity rather than to any discoverable purpose in the plays that make manifest his astonishing and opulent genius .

		They were fashioned , to all outward seeming , to meet the demands of the crowd , the `` boisterous crowd , warm-hearted , full-blooded , of unbounded patriotism , a lover of extremes , now relishing the sight of tortures , now moved at the death of a fly , a lover of the im - probable , of unexpected changes , of coarse buf - fooneries , quibbles , common witticisms easy to understand , loud noises of any sort , bells , trum - pets , cannon ; men , all of them , of an encyclopse - dic ignorance . ''

		It was a crowd that could swal - low anything , and asked only to be amused and thrilled .

		Hence it was safe to adopt such gen - eral rules as that `` all antique personages having lived in antiquity are , generally speaking , con - temporaries and can quote one another , '' and that '' all distant towns are by the seaside . ''

		His public was not disturbed by anachronisms and dislocated geography ; why should he permit pedantic scruples to hamper the free flight of his imagination ?

		We doubt , however , if
M. Jusserand	PERSON	does com - plete justice to the Elizabethan audience .

		It en - joyed coarseness and brutality and extravagance and buffoonery , but it must also have had a con - siderable capacity to appreciate the plays it wit - nessed in their poetical and philosophical aspects .

		The popularity of Shakespeare would be as un - accountable as that of Aristophanes , upon so narrow a basis as that suggested by our author .

		His idea is that the beauty and the wisdom of the plays were put into them by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to please himself , and not because he had any notion that these qualities would make the plays more acceptable to the public . ''

		To the coarse food his groundlings wanted he added the ethereal food which has been for ages the relish of the greatest in mankind . ''

		He did this '' because it was in him to do so , because it gave him no more trouble than to put in quibbles , jokes , or mas - sacres , and because experience had shown him that , while it was not at all necessary to success , it did not hurt , and was received with a good grace . ''

		But this is too simple an explanation , for if we try to imagine '' A Midsummer Night 's Dream '' and '' The Tempest '' divested of all that has made them abiding possessions of the race , we can not think that what would remain would have had much attraction for an
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan audience .

		In urging this view , M. Jus - serand runs counter to what is elsewhere one of his main contentions that the audience was second only to the poet 's genius as a factor in the production of the plays .

		By what right does he assume that this reaction of public upon producer was effective only in relation to the grosser qual - ities of the works produced ?

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 457 '' In the course of ages , '' says
M. Jusserand	PERSON	, `` while praise and admiration were becoming boundless , an anxious note has been sounded from time to time , the more striking that it came from admirers . ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	said : '' He sacri - fices virtue to convenience , and is so much more careful to please than to instruct that he seems to write without any moral purpose . ''

		And
Emerson	PERSON	, after admitting that '' as long as the question is of talent and mental power , the world of men has not his equal to show , '' is still im - pelled to ask : '' But when the question is to life , and its materials , and its auxiliaries , how does it profit me ? ''

		This is a question that must be met , for the time is long past when the plea of art for art 's sake gave it an adequate answer .

		If we have not gone from the extreme of the Goncourts to the extreme of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, we have at least freed ourselves from the narrow notion that art has no concern with morality .

		We believe , in fact , that morality is the highest concern of art , and its only solid justification ; but we have also come to realize that the ethical message need not be obtruded , and , indeed , that the more im - plicit it remains the more pervasive will be its sub-conscious workings .

		All this our author very clearly understands , and states in an argument that could not easily be bettered . ''

		For compelling hearts to expand , and making us feel for others than ourselves , for breaking the crust of inborn egoism ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has , among playwrights , no equal .

		Here works that supreme power of his : to bestow life , full and real life , on whomsoever he pleases , to de - lineate character with so great a perfection that such people as he presents to us we know thoroughly , and what happens to them strikes us the more since they are of our acquaintance ; not a passing acquaintance , casually made , soon forgotten , but that of men who will accompany us through life , ever reappearing on the slightest occasion or merest allusion , in tears or smiles , moving us at the remembrance of a happiness and of disasters in which we take part though they be not ours .

		The fate of a Hamlet , an
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	, a
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	, an Othello , carries , to be sure , no concrete moral with it ; the noblest , the purest , the most generous , sink into the dark abyss after agonizing tortures , and one can scarcely imagine what , being human , they should have avoided to escape their misery .

		Their story was undoubtedly written ' without any moral purpose , ' but not without any moral effect .

		It obliges human hearts to melt , it teaches them pity . ''

		All morality has its source in the springs of human sympathy , and the truest moralist is he who taps those springs most skilfully .

		Can it be doubted that such an enlargement of our human - ity as is wrought within us by the reading of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is one of the most potent influences in the shaping of our own conduct for good ?

		BUYING CHRISTMAS BOOKS FOR CHILDREN .

		There are very few parents who go to the book - stores around the holiday season with any clear idea as to what there is or what they want .

		Con - sequently , the publishers take a certain advantage of this ignorance , and attract the eye with ravishing covers a subterfuge similar to the frontispiece with which they catch the interest of the boy or girl .

		I have watched children in the public library choos - ing books from the shelves .

		Little fingers will run through the leaves , searching for the essential action of the story , usually embodied in the illustrations .

		Bookbuyers at
Christmas	LOCATION	time are very much like these youngsters .

		Bright color halts them before a counter , where they gaze vaguely around them .

		`` Have you something on football ? ''

		they ask , remembering
Tommy	PERSON	and his wish .

		But they do not know , after they have seen the book all gar - nished , whether or not it is the best book to be had on the subject .

		Someone , other than the bookseller , needs to assure them that
Walter Camp	PERSON	is the authority they want and their son wants ; that his account of football is excitement and accuracy com - bined .

		For , as far as sport is concerned , all boys are authorities .

		We want a clearing-house for shoppers who seek children 's literature .

		The two hundred volumes be - fore me as I write suggest this necessity .

		`` Which shall I take ? ''

		they ask , ''
Barbour	PERSON	's or Pier 's ath - letic story ? ''

		They would not run much risk in buying either , for books of this order are of average excellence ; the game is the thing .

		I marvel some - times at the minuteness of detail in these stories ; the zest with which the event is followed , whether on the gridiron , the diamond , or the track .

		I have noted more than once that men who write for chil - dren spend all their energies on the exploitation of outward action , on moral qualities made evident by outward attitude .

		The characters in their books rarely grow ; they are lacking in spiritual perspec - tive .

		Women , on the contrary , pay keener attention to the spiritual growth of their heroines .

		In any of the series by
Stratemeyer	PERSON	or Tomlinson or
Dudley	PERSON	, the incidents alone vary ; the hero of last year 's book is by no means twelve months older in this year 's book .

		But the girls in the stories by
Marion Ames Taggart	PERSON	,
Etta A. Baker	PERSON	, and others , lengthen their manners with their skirts .

		That is the essen - tial difference between the masculine and feminine elements in children 's literature .

		As a constant reviewer of juvenile books , I can very quickly decide upon an arbitrary classification of the two hundred volumes before me .

		I could have predicted by last year 's output what this year 's harvest was to be .

		To anyone in close touch with the situation , it is evident that the publishers are concerned chiefly with two matters : their travellers have told them that the `` series '' are easy to sell , since young readers find universal satisfaction in 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, knowing more and more of a particular hero or hero - ine ; and their ledgers tell them that their greatest profit comes when the books they publish are adopted by school-boards as supplementary reading .

		It is therefore evident that there is a '' trade-mark '' value to literature ; in fact , if I am not mistaken , the title of '' The Little Colonel Series '' has been patented .

		It is also evident that there is an educa - tional style born of the desire to furnish information suitable to different grades of the modern public - school system .

		Owing to the latter demand , the ju - venile market is flooded with books in which history is foreshortened , in which the classics are re-told , in which the `` Tales from Shakespeare , '' made famous by the Lambs , have been added to by zealous hands , anxious to complete the round of the dramas , and with volumes from which the element of cruelty has been weeded as a concession to fastidious minds .

		What has been the result ?

		The foreshortened history , the desire to make a concise story of inci - dents in a man 's life , have deprived children of any distinctive biography a field which writers might consider to advantage .

		The informative statement , coupled to a narrative style , has produced books of travel not written in direct descriptive manner , but in dialogue form , where the puppet-characters ask impossible questions and receive encyclopaedic an - swers .

		It is the survival of the '' Guide to Knowl - edge '' and of the Rollo manner , with none of the excellences of the
Jacob Abbott	PERSON	genius .

		Besides being ruled by the textbook demand , children 's literature is being over-edited : first , as I suggested , because of ultra-sensitiveness ; and sec - ond , because of a false ambition to simplify an ambition forgetful of the fact that a child 's compre - hension is far in advance of his capacity or his equipment for reading .

		Again I repeat Lamb 's stricture to
Godwin	PERSON	, to the effect that nothing should be kept from children but the disgusting .

		This standard would not please the ethical taste of to-day .

		Even Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, in his introduction for the excel - lent new edition of `` Tom
Brown	PERSON	's School Days , '' deplores the fact that such a good school story the pioneer of its class should be marred by the beer - drinking habit among students of the mid - Victorian period !

		But I am inclined to believe that literature lives because of its vitality ; that to remove the soil around its roots enfeebles it ; that modern mildness kills it .

		And when a book of fairy tales is issued , I immediately turn to '' Little Red Riding Hood '' to see whether or not children are to have the satis - faction of shrinking over the ravenous wolf .

		There is an educative value in fear !

		It is desecration to prune a ballad for the sake of the modern peace societies to omit descriptive lines from poems in the belief that juvenile readers dislike them .

		In other words , I would be faithful to the original even to the extent of turning to the source for all material used by the professional story-teller .

		Only last year some daring writer pruned Cooper of the parts the writer deemed boresome ; thereby he was content in the belief that he quickened the action .

		Imagine
Thackeray	PERSON	relieved of his characteristic and literary padding !

		The juvenile market is flooded with such perversions .

		Even though the publisher has to cater to the tastes of all children , rather than to the taste of a particular child , still the copyright law should protect us from spurious volumes , no matter what the educational plea is .

		In substance , an editor will say : '' The poem is given intact , save in those instances where unessential lines are omitted for the sake of simpler action and of greater clarity . ''

		That is usually the volume to distrust .

		Were I , therefore , `` the average shopper , '' I should first ask for the season 's special editions .

		Perhaps these will be more expensive than are de - sired .

		Still , it were better by far to place in the hands of a boy such an edition as
Wyeth	LOCATION	's illustrated '' Treasure Island , '' than to have him spend his time on a less expensive and more mediocre story .

		Such an edition as this of
Stevenson	PERSON	's classic is a publish - er 's luxury .

		I can not blame any particular force for the aver - age level of our children 's literature .

		But among the two hundred books before me , I can take pleas - ure in selecting a no mean proportion of editions worthy examples of the publisher 's art of which we may be justly proud .

		I will accept any amount of harmless frivolity for the sake of such an exqui - site example of taste and feeling as
Boyd Smith	ORGANIZATION	's illustrated edition of '' - <
Esop	ORGANIZATION	's Fables . ''

		My experience in library work and in the publish - ing field leads me to believe that children 's litera - ture even more than adult literature is affected by the economic situation confronting both publisher and author .

		The former is nearly always disap - pointed in the sales of those books into which he has put a personal pride in the manufacture .

		And the publisher is '' content to expect small profit in such volumes as
Rackham	PERSON	's ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' and
Parrish	PERSON	's '' Arabian Nights . ''

		But in order to make such en - terprises feasible , he is obliged to bring out a con - siderable number of average books that will have popular sales .

		On the other hand , the prices paid for children 's literature are as a rule so small that an author either has to write two or three books a year , or be content with scarcely sufficient royalty returns to pay for the labor .

		And because of the small return , the good writer is difficult to procure unless his book can appeal to young and old alike .

		Unfortunately , libraries can not afford to buy ex - pensive editions .

		Some twenty-five books on my desk good matter , and mostly permanent range in price from two to three dollars .

		This is not the democratic figure , and for sales the publisher can - not depend too largely upon institutional support .

		Such a volume as Jerrold 's '' Big Book of Nursery Rhymes , '' or the same editor 's `` Big Book of Fairy Tales , '' is a rare possession , even for a library .

		Yet in children 's literature the most expensive book is oftenest the cheapest in the end .

		Buyers should remember this .

		My ideals are not so high that I would feed the
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 459 juvenile mind wholly with what might be called the permanent books , with what the libraries call '' non - fiction . ''

		There is a class of literature as necessary to the boy or girl as the newspaper is to the man or woman .

		I believe in the latest story about last year 's sensational polar expeditions ; I believe in narratives up-to-date in the latest aeroplane novel - ties .

		Books on warships , on handicraft , on boat - sailing , are necessary : they are sexless , appealing to boys and girls alike .

		But I contend that though each year sees the manufacture of many juvenile books , there are but a mere handful of writers who really know how to tell a story or how to present a subject , unless the '' series '' formula is followed , and unless an educational demand is fulfilled .

		I can find nothing pernicious or perverting in the year 's product ; publishers in this respect protect the public .

		But since some libraries have removed ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' from the circulating shelves , and since peace societies have condemned the gun and the sword , and since ethical teachers have deplored the '' strong '' element in folk-lore , I may not know just what perverting or pernicious means .

		Some years ago the sales of '' Mother Goose '' were materially decreased by the enormous popu - larity of ' Foxy Grandpa . ''

		The
Sunday	DATE	newspaper supplement was responsible for this .

		But I have found for several years past that publishers are de - sirous of reinstating '' Mother Goose , '' even if they have not succeeded in rescuing
Santa Glaus	PERSON	from the restraining hand of the non-sectarian public school .

		This is one example of their readiness to meet any concerted demand on the part of the public .

		For some time it has been generally advo - cated that the
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	picture-books should be re-issued .

		The publishers are now doing this , and it remains to be seen whether the demand mostly of library origin was legitimate .

		These are random thoughts for the buyer of child - ren 's books .

		The
Pratt Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	has an exhibition every holiday season of the best juve - nile literature , old and new .

		Other institutions con - duct similar exhibitions .

		By this means the parent may examine for herself , and become armed and forewarned .

		Attend these exhibitions , and you will be confronted by much the same array as I now have before me only more rigorously weeded out , with the addition of the best that has already been printed .

		There is much that will satisfy the shop - per of the present without considering any of the new publications ; were the publishers to decide not to accept anything new for several years , still would the libraries have a rich abundance from the books already in stock to choose from .

		I take it that if after reading a hundred stories we find any rising above the general level of remem - brance , those are the ones to be accounted perma - nent .

		Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's '' Mother
Gary	PERSON	's Chickens '' and Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's `` The Secret Garden '' are of this distinction .

		The situation admits of these conclusions : first , that there are very few people writing for children who really know how to write for them ; second , that the larger percentage of writers go about their task mechanically , and according to a formula which may be readily learned after reading a few of the '' series '' books ; third , that educational strictures allow of little novelty ; fourth , that fact crowds out imagination in reality , the free play of imagina - tion is not countenanced in modern education ; fifth , that the field of biography is unusually poor ; and sixth , that books for the kindergarten age are com - monplace and scarce .


Dion Boucicault	PERSON	, advising a young playwright to be more concise in his dialogue , said , '' Write it as though each word were part of a telegram , and had to be paid for . ''

		And , in a way , that is my advice to the Christmas shopper looking for children 's books .

		Choose them as though each one cost two or three dollars .

		You will then consider more care - fully , and your sixty-cent volume or your gay cover or your '' catch '' frontispiece will no longer be a snare .

		MONTBOSE J. MOSES .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE NIGHTMARE OF DEAD BOOKS more and more disturbs the nocturnal slumbers of the '' practical '' librarian , and he scans the morning horizon in vain hope of the coming of another Omar out of the East to burn his library to the ground and so relieve him of the distracting problem of what to do with the superseded and never-read volumes that occupy so much sorely-needed space .

		Of course the incinera - tion of the Alexandrian library is all a myth , as we are now taught to believe , but not a few hold that it ought to have been a veritable occurrence if it was n't .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	, as orator at the dedication of the new
Mitchell Library	ORGANIZATION	building at
Glasgow	LOCATION	re - cently , declared himself overcome with a hideous de - pression in the face of so enormous a mass of useless printed matter , so vast a cemetery of dead books .

		He urged the wholesale destruction of the accumu - lated rubbish of centuries ; and Mr.
Edmund Go	PERSON	^ se , in a later comment on his speech , heartily echoed the speaker 's sentiments , even going so far as to pro- nounce the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	libraries that besprinkle the land a '' mixed and doubtful blessing . ''

		The ap - praisal of a library by its quantity rather than quality of books is to be deprecated , as Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	says ; and the discrimination that is needed in order to make a library rich and valuable in the true sense has '' produced in our generation , '' as Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	observes , '' a new and a high profession the pro- fession of librarian . ''

		But in this increasing demand for the ruthless destruction of books that have passed the stage of active usefulness , there is of course much that is not to be taken seriously .

		The older and larger libraries serve a distinct purpose in being the storehouses of printed matter that no single student and no small library can afford to own and keep .

		The least likely book is occasionally called for by somebody somewnere .

		Therefore let the great libra - 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ries of the world retain their vast collections intact , but let the newer ones heed the outcry against dead books and use every possible precaution to acquire none but living and useful ones .

		Finally , who would undertake to determine , and by what rule , the books that are sufficiently dead to be cast on the funeral THE OLD-FASHIONED DISCURSIVE BOOK-REVIEW , like Macaulay 's '' Bacon '' or ''
Clive	PERSON	, '' sweeping in a wide circle around its central theme and bringing into its net all however remotely relevant material within reach , would present a strange appearance in a modern literary periodical .

		Yet in some such archaic style is written an excellent article on '' Fam - ous Autobiographies '' in the current ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review , '' the very organ that did so much toward developing and perfecting the above-mentioned Macaulayesque type of literary criticism and disser - tation .

		The article in question does not even concern itself with any later autobiography than
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's , the others discussed being
Cellini	PERSON	's ,
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- bon 's , and Mill 's , and
Rousseau	PERSON	's '' Confessions '' and Goethe 's '' Dichtung und Wahrheit . ''

		The anony - mous writer takes occasion to say some things that were worth saying , and that arrest the attention as one turns the leaves .

		Referring to the common prefatory apology for seeming egotism on the autobiographer 's part , he maintains that `` there should be no need for such apology , '' since '' there is no sort of reason why egotism should be inherent in autobiography .

		That it is often found there is due to the fact that most men can not talk about themselves except ego - tistically , for the reason that they are egotistical by nature . ''

		Somebody has said , or , if not , let it here be said , that the best autobiographies are those that remain unwritten because of the lack of that slight prick of egotism which , our essayist to the contrary notwithstanding , every autobiographer must feel be - fore he will take pen in hand , but the entire absence of which would put the last fascinating touch to one of the most agreeable forms of prose composition .

		MEMORY FOR POETRY seems to be of a somewhat special sort .

		Macaulay , with his alleged ability to repeat all of '' Paradise Lost , '' certainly had it in a remarkable degree , as he also had memory for much besides poetry for the names of all the Popes , for instance , in chronological order from the beginning , and for the names of
Cambridge	LOCATION	senior wranglers from such time as no other man 's memory went to the contrary .

		The questions-and-answers department of many a daily newspaper often produces striking examples of this poetic memory , so to name it for brevity 's sake .

		A journal now before us prints from a correspondent a twelve-stanza poem recalled `` from memories of sixty years ago . ''

		This sounds at first rather remarkable , or even incredible ; but in reality it is the poems of childhood , the Mother Goose rhymes , for instance , learned without effort and often without intention , that are the easiest to reproduce , whereas the laboriously acquired stanzas of yesterday are too likely to be gone to-morrow .

		What would not some of us give to be able to repeat and to retain a piece of verse after one reading or one hearing , as perhaps we once could easily do ?

		But like a heaped-up market-basket on a jolting cart , the mind spills first the things last committed to its keeping ; and if the journey be long enough and jolty enough , precious little but the very earliest memories remains in the bottom of the basket at last .

		FIRE-EATING POETS have been not few or far be - tween ever since Tyrtaeus , the lame schoolmaster from
Athens	LOCATION	, with his martial strains aroused the Spartans to such a pitch of warlike frenzy that , in their desperate struggle with the Messenians , they finally routed the enemy with great slaughter and drove Aristomenes to the hills .

		In the present deadly encounter between
Italy	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	, Signer d'An - nunzio is playing the Tyrtaeus to his armed country - men . ''

		I fling my laurels at thy feet , O wingless victory ! ''

		he cries in his '' Song of the Outre-mer . '' ''

		The hour has come .

		Thou smilest upon the land thou hast vanquished .

		To-day , O
Italy	LOCATION	, thou art mis - tress of thy destiny !

		In the shriek of the storm-bird I hear the eagle of Mars .

		A MATHEMATICIAN 'S LITERARY DIVERSIONS have seldom taken so wide a range and displayed so va - ried a character as have those of the industrious Pro- fessor
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	One might almost call him ubiquitous as well as industrious ; for wherever there is something doing of a sort to appeal to his book - writing fancy , there he is sure to make his ap - pearance , pen in hand .

		The compelling personality of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	attracted him , and now we have an elaborate and much-discussed biography of the man .


Mark Twain	PERSON	, many years earlier , drew young Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	into the charmed circle of his presence , and when the humorist died a book about him was not long in getting itself written by his ar - dent admirer .

		The latest employment for this busy pen has been the translating of Professor
Emile Boutroux	PERSON	's excellent study of
William James	PERSON	; and a goodly company of readers will welcome the book in its English dress .

		THE DIAL SILENCE IN THE LIBRARY , a fragile thing always desired by readers , but not always easily obtainable , is liable to breakage from three chief causes the human voice , the too forcible closing of doors , and the over-emphatic impact of human feet against the lib - rary floor .

		The second of these disturbing agencies was largely removed when the observant and inven - tive sexton of a fashionable church -LRB- with its full quota of fashionable late-comers -RRB- invented the now all but universal pneumatic anti-slamming device which kindly but firmly forbids the door-banger to effectuate his customary bang .

		The third noise - producing cause was in good part eliminated by constructing floors of non-resonant solidity and spreading them with hemp matting , linoleum , or other noise-deadening material .

		In this approximation to perfectly soundless flooring the new
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library building has achieved some - thing of note .

		A one-inch thick concrete layer , made of cement -LRB- one part -RRB- , sand -LRB- two parts -RRB- , and saw - dust -LRB- three-quarters of a part -RRB- , has been spread over five thousand square feet of floor ; and on this suffi - ciently elastic surface has been laid cork carpeting , which is firmly held in place by nails , the sawdust constituent of the concrete admitting of their use .

		To walk on such a floor is next to walking on air .

		Who now will invent a voice-absorbing gas or vapor , harm - less to the lungs but an effectual non-conductor of needless conversation , to be diffused through the atmosphere of public reading-rooms ?

		THE LATE
WILLIAM CLARK RUSSELL	PERSON	is not com - monly thought of as a native of this country , but he was born in
New York	LOCATION	sixty-seven years ago .

		His father ,
Henry Russell	PERSON	, is best remembered as the composer of < k A Life on the Ocean Wave '' and '' Cheer , Boys , Cheer , '' with other popular melodies .

		His mother was a connection of the Wordsworths , and had enjoyed in her childhood some acquaintance with
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	, and
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	.

		Hence he came legitimately by his artistic and literary instincts .

		Tales of mad pranks at school and of a disenchanting experience as midshipman in the English navy have come down to us , also some account of his subsequent voyages to all parts of the world , experiences that equipped him for his life - work as writer of tales of the sea .

		A term of odious service in a stock-broker 's office , however , intervened before he was fairly launched in literature .

		It ap - pears that a blank-verse tragedy in five acts , entitled ''
Fra Angelo	PERSON	, '' was among his first serious essays in authorship , and that it was the last play produced by
Walter Montgomery	PERSON	before he committed suicide which may or may not be a commentary on its qual - ity .

		At any rate , the tragedy failed to score a success at the Hay market Theatre , and its author abandoned tragic poetry for more cheerful prose .

		Journalism , unsuccessful editorship , and other experiments in the world of letters , prepared the way eventually for that brilliantly successful series of sea novels that made
Clark Russell	PERSON	known wherever English fiction is read .

		THE CAUSE OF INTELLECTUAL ADVANCE IN
INDIA	LOCATION	has suffered loss in the death of Sister Nivedita a few weeks ago , at Darjeeling in the
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Margaret Noble	PERSON	, as she was known before joining the
Ramakrishna Brotherhood	ORGANIZATION	about twelve years ago , was born in
Ireland	LOCATION	forty-four years ago , being the daughter of a nonconformist minister .

		Becoming interested in education , she had distin - guished herself among the '' new educationists '' in
London	LOCATION	, and had founded the
Sesame Club	ORGANIZATION	when
Swami Vivekananda	PERSON	, the first really persuasive apostle of the Hindu faith to visit the west , began a series of lectures in the English metropolis in
1895	DATE	, two years after his memorable appearance at the
Chicago World	ORGANIZATION	's Fair .

		In Sister Nivedita 's book , '' The Master as I Saw Him , '' published a year and a half ago and briefly reviewed in
THE DIAL	LOCATION	, it is told how she became a follower of the eloquent Indian missionary , and how she went to
India	LOCATION	in
1898	DATE	and became virtually a member of the order of which he was the head .

		She is said to have led a life of the greatest simplicity , entirely among the natives , to whom she became known far and wide .

		The teaching of classes of girls and women was her first work , but her active interest in the general cause of culture and progress in the land of her adoption made her also a widely-known lecturer ; and when health failed her she resorted to her pen for the expression of her ideas , her influence extending to every part of the country .

		It is even believed that to her words , spoken and written , is largely due the present grow - ing hope and expectation of Indian nationality .

		THE AMUSING FUTILITY OF PEN SQUABBLES has seldom been better illustrated than by the recent interchange of acrimonious remarks between '' The Spectator '' and '' The English Review . ''

		Each party to the dispute observed , or endeavored to observe , the forms of politeness , until the strain toward the end became too great for weak human nature , and some vehement language was indulged in . ''

		The Spectator '' courteously prints the most passionate protests against its alleged assumption of the literary censor 's functions , and then proceeds to show that it has simply been allowing the enemy '' rope enough to hang himself , '' and we are invited to contemplate the dangling corpse .

		On the other side , amid the '' torrent of words '' -LRB- as it is called by the journal against which it is directed -RRB- our eye catches the fol - lowing , which might distress and alarm if it did not move to laughter : '' There is a pit fouler than any imagined by

		* The two volumes , ''
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	, a Musical Autobiography , '' published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in
1904	DATE	, shortly after the great conductor 's death , are now followed by another , written and compiled by his widow ,
Rose Fay Thomas	PERSON	, and dedicated to her brother ,
Charles Norman Fay	PERSON	, as a tribute to his import - ant service to the organization of the orchestra bearing Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's name .

		It is dated at '' Felsengarten , '' the
New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	country home to which Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	was devotedly at - tached , and which in his later years , after the long battle for higher music was won , became his favorite resting-place .

		Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	's preface succinctly defines the scheme of the work .

		She says : '' I have endeav - ored to confine my own part of the narrative to a simple relation of the sequence of events in his career , and to occasional touches which might reveal something of the deeper and more in - timate side of his nature kuown only to those who shared his home .

		In describing his achieve - ments , I have used , so far as possible , the words of others chiefly of eminent professional critics or musicians who personally attended the great musical events under his leadership . ''

		Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	also adds : `` If therefore some inac - curacies have crept in , despite my earnest care and the six years of research I have devoted to the work , I must crave indulgence because of the great difficulty of the task . ''

		From an intimate acquaintance with Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	and his work , I feel warranted in stating that these memoirs need no apology on the score of inac - curacy .

		The author has had all the sources of information as to the life and career of her dis - tinguished husband that are available , and she has made use of them carefully and discriminat - ingly .

		The two books present all that is known of him that is interesting to the public .

		The earlier volumes are historical , reminiscent , and biographical , as well as autobiographical on the musical side , besides containing that remarkable half-century collection of programmes which illustrates his masterly ability as a programme maker and the gradual but sure educational development which accompanied their presen - tation .

Theodore Thomas	PERSON	's home and family relation - ship and was thus cognizant of his inner nature .

		So far as his career is concerned , it adds little that was not already known .

		Its supreme value consists in its presentation of the man himself ; and this sheds a clear light upon his professional achievements and the determined and genuinely heroic manner in which he compelled success in the face of apparently insurmountable obstacles and most depressing discouragements which would have appalled anyone of less undaunted resolution and invincible purpose .

		It clearly shows that he set his standard high , and never allowed any opposition or influence to divert him from the course he marked out when he first en - tered upon the responsible and laborious task of conducting .

		Ignorant criticism , popular pre - judice , professional jealousies , the rancor of those to whom he would not truckle , financial losses , all were faced and overcome by his inde - fatigable energy , his sound convictions , his rugged honesty , his knowledge that he was right , and his confidence that the public sooner or later would acknowledge his appeal .

		Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	has done her work well .

		She has effaced herself as far as was possible , and from her intimate knowledge and natural sym - pathy , as well as by numerous extracts from his notes , diaries , and private letters , has given us a most interesting sketch of
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	the man , as he was in his home , among his friends , and in his workroom .

		We learn of his favorite pursuits , the books he read , his passionate love of nature , his lofty characteristics on the human side , as well as the details of his orchestral ad - ministration , his relations to his musicians , the exacting study and scrupulous care he expended in preparation , and the finished performance of his duties at the conductor 's desk which never suggested the arduous preliminary labor which led up to it .

		The orchestra which he organized and held to - gether through so many years of trouble and vi - cissitudes still remains and censerves his mem - ory , and still retains the high reputation it made under his leadership , though another hand wields the baton .


Theodore Thomas	PERSON	lived long enough to enjoy the fruits of his labor , and to see his long-cherished dream of a permanent orchestra in its own home become a reality .

		All the world knows and honors him as a musician and con - ductor .

		Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	's loving tribute will still further endear his memory by giving those who only knew him as a nmsterof music a clearerview of his noble qualities of heart and soul .

		THE DIAL 463 THE AGE OF MILTON IN LITERATURE .

		* ENGLISH By completing the seventh volume of their great cooperative enterprise , Dr.
Ward	PERSON	and Mr.
Waller	PERSON	have attained the half-way mark in the undertaking as it originally was conceived .

		The transition to the next seven volumes seems to be prepared for in a closing chapter , by Professor
Harold V. Routh	PERSON	, on `` The Advent of Modern Thought in Popular Literature . ''

		In this , the discussion mainly turns upon the literature , if such it may be called , of demonology and witch - craft ; as if the destructive effects of modern rationalism were here peculiarly significant .

		But however the case may be with the perspec - tive either of these sixteen chapters , or of the work as a whole , the seventh volume probably contains more substance having a general inter - est than any preceding ; and it contains more than any subsequent volume is likely to offer , at all events until the fourteenth brings us almost to the actions and personages of our own day .

		The interest of the seventh volume is partly due to the absence of an over-refined theorizing about literary movements and tendencies , but to a great extent arises from the number of authors here discussed who are known to the general reader .

		Professor
Moorman	PERSON	leads off with an acceptable chapter onHerrick ,
Carew	PERSON	, Suckling , and
Lovelace	PERSON	, and is followed by the Rev.
F. E. Hutchinson	PERSON	, who deals with '' the sacred poets , ''
Herbert	PERSON	,
Crashaw	PERSON	,
Vaughan	PERSON	, and the redis - covered
Traherne	PERSON	.

		Other names that appear are those of
Waller	PERSON	,
Denham	PERSON	, and
Cowley	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Bunyan	PERSON	, Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	,
Izaak Walton	PERSON	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	, and
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	.

		It is true , the pages on
George Herbert	PERSON	are not in the style of that American expositor whose name for various reasons never can be dissociated from the name of the poet .

		It is true also that the discussion of
Milton	LOCATION	is not from the hand of
Canon Beech	ORGANIZATION	- ing , who must be considered the first choice for a treatment of this subject .

		But there is more than one article , like that of Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	on Jacobean and
Caroline Criticism	PERSON	, where the selection could not have been more fortunate , the writer being known , and having long been known , for his special attainments in the field .

		It is the emanations of special competence that alone make a book or chapter glow with real interest .

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The sub-title of the volume , '' Cavalier and Puritan , '' perhaps is not well chosen , since the main authors who are treated in it do not in every case fall neatly into one or the other compart - ment .

		Milton , for example , who believed in monarchy , yet constrained himself to serve the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, had absorbed too much of the culture of
Italy	LOCATION	to be called with any exactness a Puritan ; as he had absorbed too much from the Neoplatonists , and was too much in sympathy with certain Alexandrian tendencies , to be thought of as purely Hellenic , or to be regarded as essentially Hebraic though a greater than Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	so regarded him .

		Professor
Saintsbury	PERSON	does not , indeed , appear to have formed any unified notion of Milton as an individual , or even to have recognized the need of trying to form one .

		That is a negative censure .

		Since the chapter on
Milton	PERSON	ought to have been a powerful , constructive , sympathetic essay , the most noble and serious contribution to the volume , giving life to the whole , one is forced to describe it in more positive terms .

		I have tried to think of suitable epithets for it other than the words '' shallow '' and '' vulgar , '' but I regret to say that I have not found them .

		The author patronizes
Milton	PERSON	, he assumes an air of scientific indifference in judging one whom he ought to love and reverence , and the inevitable result when we estimate a lofty char - acter by the standards of the herd his criticism tends to be destructive .

		Milton -LRB- who lost his eyesight in the service of his State -RRB- '' blended an excessive and eclectic draught on books and on fancy with an insufficient experience of life . ''

		What does '' life '' mean ? ''

		An
Aspasia	PERSON	- Hypatia-Lucretia-Griselda , with any naughti - ness in the first left out , and certain points in
Solomon	LOCATION	's -LSB- ?

		Lemuel 's -RSB- pattern woman added , might have met
Milton	ORGANIZATION	's views .

		But this blend has not been commonly quoted in the marriage market . '' ''

		The remarkable blends of
Milton	LOCATION	's character which are important to the compre - hension of his work require notice . ''

		Although `` it must not be supposed ... that
Milton	PERSON	's temperament was essentially or uniformly mo - rose , '' and although '' his youngest daughter ... described him as excellent company , especially with young people , '' yet '' nothing but amiable paralogism can give
Milton	PERSON	an amiable character . '' ''

		His temper may be repellant , and can hardly be attractive .

		* ' In their substance , the remarks on
Milton	PERSON	as a poet are common - place , and there is no adequate endeavor to show the essential connection between his learn - ing and his poetry , or between his poetry and 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, his prose .

		We may confine ourselves to a little of what is said about the prose . ''

		That some of
Milton	LOCATION	's prose passages are among the finest in English is hardly denied by anybody . ''

		But Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has no time to delay on these . ''

		On the whole , the two sentences , ' Salmasius is an old fool , ' and *
Morus	PERSON	is a rascally and vulgar libertine , ' rep - resent the whole gist of the two Defensiones and their supplements , watered out into hun - dreds of pages , with floods of bad jokes , trivial minutiae , and verbose vituperation . ''

		The one example of
Milton	LOCATION	's prose that is quoted in this chapter is taken for the purpose of showing him at his worst ; and for an example of those quali - ties which make serious students of English love his prose we must turn to the article of the Rev.
John Brown	PERSON	on
Bunyan	PERSON	and Mar veil .

		Is Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's Milton the charac - ter that was studied and divined by
Wordsworth	PERSON	with the loving familiarity of a scholar and the sympathetic insight of a poet ?

		Is this the
Milton	PERSON	who should return to teach us not only '' virtue , '' '' power , '' and `` freedom , '' but `` man - ners ' ' as well ?

		Or has Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	for - gotten that he is writing for a work that prides itself upon historical perspective ?

		Since he does not always substantiate his sweeping gen - eralizations with convincing evidence , we may answer opinion with opinion , letting the reader take his choice . ''

		The man , '' says
Coleridge	PERSON	, '' who reads a work meant for immediate effect on one age with the notions and feelings of another , may be a refined gentleman , but must be a sorry critic .

		He who possesses imagination enough to live with his forefathers , and , leaving comparative reflection for an after-moment , to give himself up during the first perusal to the feelings of a contemporary , if not a partisan '' , will , I dare aver , rarely find any part of
Milton	LOCATION	's prose works disgusting ... These general observations , without meditation on the particular times and the genius of the times , are most often as un - just as they are always superficial . ''

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	is , it seems to me , much more in his element in dealing with Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	in Chapter X. , on '' The Antiquaries . ''

		But his powers and attainments by no means appeal to American readers in such a fashion as to make clear to them why , in this monumental history of English literature , he should have been singled out above all other scholars to write the main articles upon three out of the four chief English poets down to
Milton	LOCATION	.

		His warmest admirer could hardly maintain hirn to be a first - class authority upon either
Milton	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or Chaucer .

		It is a relief to pass from his ut - terances upon
Milton	PERSON	to his article -LRB- Chapter IV . -RRB-

		on the `` Lesser
Caroline Poets	PERSON	, '' where his pre - vious studies are bound to win him a more re - spectful hearing .

		But it is a greater satisfaction to come to those pages which have been reserved for notice at the close of this review .

		The career and writings of
Bunyan	PERSON	, perhaps , require as much sympathy from a modern critic as do those of
Milton	LOCATION	.

		It may be easier , for instance , to pick out `` gro - tesque stories and somewhat coarse passages '' from `` The Life and Death of Mr.
Badman	PERSON	'' than to say with understanding that the allegory '' yet bears the characteristic marks of
Bunyan	PERSON	's genius , and is admittedly a work of power . ''

		The Rev.
John Brown	PERSON	brings to his task of interpretation the very qualities that the case demands sympathy , a steady belief in the dig - nity and high importance of
Bunyan	PERSON	's work as a whole , and an exhaustive knowledge of all the details .

		He has been engaged in the study of his subject for almost half a century .

		At the end of twenty years he wrote the standard bio - graphy of his favorite author , having enjoyed singular advantages in the preliminary research .

		Twenty years later he edited '' Grace Abound - ing '' and '' The Pilgrim 's Progress '' in a volume containing definitive texts of both -LRB-
1907	DATE	-RRB- .

		And now in fourteen pages of this uneven history he gives us the best account of
Bunyan	PERSON	that has ever appeared .

		Brief though it is , it could hardly be more complete .

		There is not the slighest evi - dence of haste , or constraint , or faulty perspect - ive .

		Everything falls as naturally into its place as if
Bunyan	PERSON	himself had moved the pen ; so that we may apply to this essay what its author says of
Bunyan	PERSON	's masterpiece : '' It has been said that ' The Pilgrim 's Progress ' was the last English book written without thought of the reviewer ... But , while the book thus sprang into being , effortless and fair like a flower , it is not wanting in proportion or dramatic unity . ''

		Such scholarship as that of Dr.
Brown	PERSON	may well be called the plant and flower of light .

		THE DIAL 465 THE LIBERATOR OF
ITALY	LOCATION	.

		* A year aud a half ago the writer had the pleasure of reviewing for THE DIAL -LRB-
May 16 , 1910	DATE	-RRB- Mr.
G. M. Trevelyan	PERSON	's very interesting and useful account of
Garibaldi	PERSON	's part in the de - cisive happenings of 1859-60 , entitled ''
Gari	PERSON	- baldi and the Thousand . ''

		A previous volume by the same author had narrated ''
Garibaldi	PERSON	's Defense of the Roman Republic '' ; while the third and last of the series , ''
Garibaldi	PERSON	and the Making of
Italy	LOCATION	'' the book with which this discussion is chiefly concerned covers the period extending from the capture of
Palermo	LOCATION	, in
June 1860	DATE	, to the return of the Liberator to his island farm on Caprera , in
November	DATE	of the same year , after the capture of
Gaeta	PERSON	and the almost unani - mous acceptance of
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	's govern - ment through a plebiscite had made
United Italy	LOCATION	a certainty .

		As the titles indicate , the series deals not so much with
Garibaldi	PERSON	's life as a whole , as with three short periods from his life ; and yet the periods are so well chosen and their discussion leads so naturally to incidental treatment of what preceded and what followed , as cause and effect , that we have the whole
Garibaldi	PERSON	before us when we are through , with perhaps not a great deal more difference of em - phasis than the relative importance of various epochs and incidents justifies .

		This concluding volume is happier than its forbears in the time and circumstances of its publication .

		The world is , for two reasons , espe - cially interested in things Italian at the moment :
Italy	LOCATION	has this year been celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of her birth , which happy event is dated from the official proclamation of the united Kingdom in
1861	DATE	; and her campaign against
Turkey	LOCATION	has in the last weeks turned all eyes toward her .

		The cynically-inclined might hint that her present activities have little in common with her brave and generous struggles of the earlier date ; but it is not necessary to approve in order to be interested , and the new monograph should profit from the date of its publication , widely different as it is in character from the books which commonly depend on the event of the day for their sale .


Garibaldi	PERSON	is a remarkable example of a romantically interesting leader who yet accomplishes seriously important results .

		George
Washington	LOCATION	and
Frederick the Great	PERSON	were builders of nations , as he was ; but both were incurably prosaic .

		Lord
Byron	PERSON	is a glori - ous figure in the annals of Greek liberty , but * GARIBALDI AND THE MAKING OF

New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the liberties of
Greece	LOCATION	would probably have got on nearly or quite as well without him .

		The Italian , for all his powerful appeal to the imag - inations of men , was in his way one of the world 's greatest and most gifted generals .

		His tactics at the battle of the
Volturno	ORGANIZATION	form one of the most instructive of lessons in military strategy .

		It is true that his art had its limitations , that he never showed remarkable abilities except in a certain irregular style of warfare with a small force under his command .

		He is one of those one-sided geniuses whom God seems to send at a special moment to do a special work which no one else could do .

		It is true also that he did not show his special abilities in the same degree through his entire active life .

		As a leader he seemed to fail early , while he was still physically in his prime , and to become as '' out of date '' on the battle-field as that infinitely pathetic old apostle , his co-worker
Mazzini	PERSON	, had long before become in the councils of the nation 's builders .


Garibaldi	PERSON	's work during the six months in question was the arousing of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	and the preparation of
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	's conquest of the Kingdom of
Naples	LOCATION	.

		And he was able to smooth the way for this glorious event , not so much by any actual conquest of his own , not so much even by any preparation of men 's minds , as by the fear his successes aroused in the breast of
Cavour	LOCATION	.

		That astute statesman grew alarmed lest the Dictator of
Sicily	LOCATION	, if he became dictator of half of
Italy	LOCATION	as well , would find it neither necessary nor advisable to surrender his hard - won dignity to another , and that Victor Em - manuel might be no nearer the crown of the
United Italies	LOCATION	if
Garibaldi	PERSON	conquered the
King	PERSON	- dom of
Naples	LOCATION	than if it remained subject to
Francis II	PERSON	.

		And so the strong Piedmontese army marched down from the north to do what
Garibaldi	PERSON	and his irregulars had not been able to do ; yet all they did was
Garibaldi	PERSON	's doing .

		The story in its broad outlines is a familiar one ; but there are details and undercurrents which this untiring student of obscure and neglected documents is bringing to the light of popular knowledge .

		Thus we are relieved to learn that the difnulties and disagreements be - tween the Piedmontese government and the Lib - erator were sometimes more apparent than real .

		For example , on the 22d of
July	DATE	King
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	sent a letter to the Dictator of
Sicily	LOCATION	warning him not to cross the Straits of
Messina	LOCATION	; and with this published letter went another in his own handwriting which was to be privately delivered , and which read as follows : '' Now , having written as King ,
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, suggests to you to reply in this sense , which I know is what you feel .

		Reply that you are full of devotion and reverence for your King , that you would like to obey his counsels , but that your duty to
Italy	LOCATION	forbids you to promise not to help the Neapolitans , when they appeal to you to free them from a Government which true men and good Italians can not trust ; that you can - not therefore obey the wishes of the
King	LOCATION	, but must reserve full freedom of action . ''

		A comparison of
Garibaldi	LOCATION	's famous reply with this quiet hint shows that one is but a highly embellished paraphrase of the other .

		And in the same connection , the incident of the meeting of young Ashley with
Cavour	PERSON	is both eloquent and delightful . ''

		In the course of the morning the Piedmontese ves - sel Authion appeared off Salerno and set ashore
Evelyn Ashley	PERSON	, son of the good
Lord Shaftesbury	LOCATION	, and private secretary to Lord
Palmerston	LOCATION	.

		The young man , to the intense delight of his chief , had gone out to spend his holidays with
Garibaldi	PERSON	instead of with the partridges .

		A few days before ,
Ashley	PERSON	had presented himself to
Cavour	LOCATION	in
Turin	LOCATION	, with a letter of introduction from the British Prime Minister , and had asked where he could find
Garibaldi	PERSON	. '

		Garibaldi !

		Who is he ? '

		said
Cavour	PERSON	, with a twinkle in his eye .

		I have nothing to do with him ... He is somewhere in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies , I believe , but that is not , you know , at present under my King . ''

		Garibaldi and
Cavour	PERSON	were the absolute extremes of hot enthusiasm and calculating shrewdness ; but there was never -LRB- until the great Premier 's death left a delicate task in un - worthy hands -RRB- any real danger that the enter - prise would fail because two distinct agencies were working at it .

		Professor
Thayer	PERSON	's life of
Cavour	PERSON	may help us to a more intelligent appreciation of that much-abused kingdom - builder ; but Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, enthusiastic biog - rapher of
Cavour	ORGANIZATION	's bitter enemy as he is , has warned us repeatedly that
Garibaldi	PERSON	's abuse of the Premier was due in great measure to lack of knowledge of the real facts , and that
Cavour	PERSON	, incompatible in temperament and contradictory in policy , was working as earnestly toward the one great end as
Garibaldi	PERSON	himself could have been doing .

		The author is fond of qualifying
Garibaldi	PERSON	as a '' poet , '' and of enlarging on the pleasant touches that give his delightful personality its relief .

		Thus , Colonel
Bosco	PERSON	, sent from the main - land to
Sicily	LOCATION	to retake
Palermo	PERSON	, had boasted that he would enter that city on the horse of
Medici	LOCATION	, the Garibaldian commander .

		When
Bosco	PERSON	was defeated and captured ,
Garibaldi	PERSON	decided that poetic justice demanded
Medici	ORGANIZATION	's entrance into
Messina	PERSON	on
Bosco	PERSON	's horse ; and the pageant went off as he had planned it , with the unhorsed boaster walking at the tail of the column , muttering invectives and pulling his formidable moustaches .

		The
Englishman Peard	PERSON	was frequently mistaken for the Dictator , and 011 one occasion , when it had seemed excellent policy to encourage the deception , the real
Garibaldi	PERSON	greeted the assumed one with ''
Viva Garibaldi	PERSON	! ''

		and shouts of laughter .

		And about this severely-documented record of research play the curious masculine figure of the female apostle
Jessie White Mario	PERSON	, `` that excellent creature of the Lord , ''
Alexander Dumas	PERSON	the well-intentioned but ludicrous ,
Nino Bixio	PERSON	the fire-eater , given to breaking his best friends ' heads and then apologizing in tearful contrition , and a hundred others quite as charming ; so that though we have no reason to criticize the his - torian 's plan we can not help something like dis - appointment that he decides to stop here with so interesting a theme .

		No book of purely human origin ever stood all tests ; but it would seem that so thoroughly - done a piece of work as this might have gone somewhat more deeply into the causes of certain conditions which are curtly stated and passed with scant discussion , or without it .

		Why , to put the question that haunted the reviewer most persistently , should
Garibaldi	PERSON	have met with such general support from the civilian popula - tion of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies , while the regular soldiery , even the soldiery of native birth , opposed him almost to a man when they were perfectly free to choose sides ?

		The book is no mere narrative of happenings ; it ploughs vigorously through the most stubborn roots of tangled cause and motive ; and by the standard it sets for itself , the unanswered Whys are numerous enough to cloud somewhat the pleas - ant impression of the whole .

Toronto	LOCATION	:
The Champlain Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 467 in its original form was practically inaccessible to the majority of readers , being found only in the larger reference libraries and in a few pri - vate collections .

		Among printed records of famous Western explorations , not one rivals in sheer human interest this story of
Samuel Hearne	PERSON	.

		r Unlike
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	,
Hearne	PERSON	was not a great leader of men , and hardly a great ex - plorer .

		Mackenzie by his own masterful per - sonality and indomitable energy forced a way through countless obstacles to the shores of two great oceans .

		His men grumbled at the hard - ships they were forced to endure , and some - times lost heart for a time when nature seemed too much for them ; but they dared not rebel .

		They both feared and admired their leader .

		Hearne lacked neither personal courage nor endurance , but he had little or no control over his unruly native followers .

		The real leader of his expedition was the remarkable Chipewyan chief Matonabbee , whose attitude toward
Hearne	PERSON	seems to have been an odd mixture of affection and contempt .

		Mackenzie organized and carried out his two explorations without any outside assistance in fact , in spite of the tacit opposi - tion of the partners of the great fur-trading company to which he belonged .


Hearne	PERSON	, on the other hand , was equipped and sent forth by the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	, with definite instructions as to what he was to do in every possible contingency .

		He was , in fact , over-bur - dened with instructions , as he dryly points out in his Introduction .

		Nevertheless , if
Hearne	ORGANIZATION	's actual achievement was inferior to that of
Mack	PERSON	- enzie , his manner of telling about it is vastly superior .


Mackenzie	PERSON	's style is dry and some - times labored .

		His one great object was to reach his goal , and he ignored everything that had no direct bearing on his journey or its speedy com - pletion .

		His men , white and red , were merely pawns in the game .

		We get no glimpse of their personalities , and hear little of the tribes visited by the way .

		But
Hearne	PERSON	, if he could not control his native companions , took the keenest interest in their individual and tribal characteristics ; and his account of the tribes of the extreme North remains to-day , after a lapse of two and a quarter centuries , the best avail - able .

		He was untiring in his study of the man - ners and customs of the northern Indians , and never missed an opportunity of questioning them .

		All this material he preserved in his nar - rative , and put together with the skill of a born story-teller .

		He makes us see the things he saw , the places he visited , the native games and cere - monies he witnessed , the men and women he met by the way .

		There is nothing more graphic in the literature of travel than
Hearne	PERSON	's descrip - tion of the massacre of the Eskimo at
Bloody Fall	ORGANIZATION	, and nothing more living than his picture of the manly and sagacious chief Matonabbee .

		The peculiar appropriateness of entrusting the editing of this edition of the '' Journey to the Coppermine '' to Mr.
J. B. Tyrrell	PERSON	is brought out by Sir
Edmund Walker	PERSON	in the Preface : '' Mr.
J. B. Tyrrell	PERSON	began his work of exploring in
Northwestern Canada	LOCATION	iu
1880	DATE	, and during the ensuing fifteen years he made many important additions to our knowledge of the geology and geography of what is still the least known part of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		In
1893	DATE	, accompanied by his brother , Mr.
J. W. Tyrrell	PERSON	, as his assistant , he traversed the so-called Barren Grounds from
Lake Athabaska	LOCATION	eastward to
Chesterfield Inlet	LOCATION	, and from there his party paddled in canoes down the west shore of
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	to
Fort Churchill	LOCATION	.

		Of the 3200 miles thus traversed ,
1650	DATE	were previously unsurveyed and unmapped From Fort Churchill Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	walked eight or nine hundred miles on snowshoes to the south - ern end of
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	.

		In
1894	DATE	he again crossed the Barren Grounds , this time travelling from the north end of Reindeer Lake to a point on
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, about 200 miles southwest of
Chesterfield Inlet	LOCATION	.

		Thence he went to
Churchill	LOCATION	as before in canoes along the open coast .

		From Churchill Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	again , by another route , walked on snowshoes to the southern end of
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	.

		On this journey he travelled about 2900 miles , of which 1750 were by canoe and 750 on snow - shoes .

		Almost the whole journey was through perfectly unexplored country .

		For the geographical work done in these two years he was awarded the Back Premium by the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	. ''

		In reply to an enquiry whether any other white man had visited the regions described by
Hearne	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Tyrell	PERSON	himself writes : '' I happen to be the only one since
Hearne	PERSON	who has conducted explorations in the country lying between
Fort Churchill	LOCATION	and the eastern end of
Great Slave Lake	LOCATION	and south of latitude 63 N. Except Hearue , I and those who have accompanied and assisted me are the only white men who have crossed that great stretch of country , north of a line between the mouth of the
Churchill River	LOCATION	and
Lake Athabasca	LOCATION	and a line between the east end of
Great Slave Lake	ORGANIZATION	and
Chesterfield Inlet	LOCATION	.

		Absolutely the only information that I had about the region when I visited it , other than what I had secured in conversation with Indians , was contained in
Hearne	ORGANIZATION	's book My last journey was made sixteen years ago , and no white man has since travelled across that country .

		With the building of the railroad to
Fort Churchill	LOCATION	, it will doubtless soon be visited .

		Since I made a survey of
Chesterfield Inlet	LOCATION	and its vicinity , my brother Mr.
J. W. Tyrrell	PERSON	, has crossed from the east end of Great Slave Lake by the
Hanbury River	LOCATION	to
Chesterfield Inlet	LOCATION	, making a survey as he went , and the
Royal North West Mounted Police	ORGANIZATION	have sent parties from the
Mackenzie River	LOCATION	to
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	along this route , using my brother 's maps as their guide .

		It is hardly necessary to say that a magnificent field for exploration is still left in that far northern country . ''

		468 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Fjln his admirable Introduction , Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	has brought together all that could be gleaned from widely scattered sources as to the life and achievements of
Hearne	ORGANIZATION	.

		One particularly in - teresting find is an obituary notice which he dis - covered in the
1797	DATE	volume of the '' European Magazine and
London	LOCATION	Review , '' and which con - tains the only known account of
Hearne	ORGANIZATION	's early life , before he went forth to discover the Cop - permine .


Hearne	PERSON	's text has been illuminated by a number of valuable foot-notes , those of a geographical or ethnological nature being by Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	, and those bearing on natural history by Mr.
E. A. Preble	PERSON	, of the Biological Survey ,
Washington	LOCATION	, who spent a
summer	DATE	on the west shore of
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	north of
Churchill	LOCATION	, and several other seasons in the
Mackenzie River	LOCATION	country and the region north of
Great Slave Lake	LOCATION	.

		To the original illustrations of
Hearne	ORGANIZATION	's Journey , Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	has added a number of his own photographs of the
Barren Grounds	ORGANIZATION	, and several additional maps .

		Altogether this new edition of one of the most fascinating among the older books of travel is creditable alike to the editor , to his colleague Mr.
Preble	PERSON	, and to the
Champlain Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		A SOUTHERN WOMAN 'S RECOLLECTIONS OF SIXTY YEARS .

		* '' Recollections , grave and gay '' is the apt and predictive title chosen for the volume of Rem - niscences by Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	. ''

		Grave and gay '' incidents are well mingled in this in - teresting and readable book .

		The earlier chap - ters introduce the reader to
Virginia	LOCATION	before the War , and to several of her aristocratic families , some of whom were kin to Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	.

		In direct and intimate style she recalls her girlhood as
Constance Gary	PERSON	, at
Alexandria	LOCATION	and
Vaucluse	LOCATION	, the ancestral home of the
Fairfax	LOCATION	family .

		Gene - alogical data , sometimes seemingly too detailed , are enlivened by racy accounts of romances and festive hospitality .

		The author explains : `` I am making no attempt to record chronologically the events of my modest experience in childhood .

		I am simply writing down , as they drift to me out of the mists of memory , things about people most familiar to me , thinking it may interest readers as a page torn from old-time chronicles of American social life before the War . ''

Henry Clay	PERSON	, and her impressions of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, the '' power of his personality '' and '' the
summer	DATE	lightning smile which played over his rugged face '' leaving upon her a life memory of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	levee which she attended , as a young girl , where foreign ministers in regalia crowded against backwoodsmen in flannel shirts and ''
Sunday	DATE	coats . ''

		With the first notes of war , and the battles of Bull Run and
Manassas	LOCATION	, conditions changed rapidly from abundant luxuries and gayety in
Southern	LOCATION	homesteads to scenes of ruined estates , physical suffering , and mental anguish .

		One feels the thrill of patriotism and the spirit of un - daunted loyalty of the women of the
Southland	ORGANIZATION	, as Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	portrays their glad exchange of their beautiful homes for shelter in barren inns and wayside cabins , that they might thus be near to nurse and to nourish their wounded soldiers .

		Vivid scenes are reenacted at the im - provised hospitals at
Culpepper Court House	ORGANIZATION	, and at
Camp Winder	LOCATION	, where Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's mother was nurse-in-charge and her daughter
Constance	PERSON	was a brave and resourceful atten - dant .

		Many of the Recollections cluster about
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	, from his inauguration at
Richmond	LOCATION	, with enthusiasm and hope , to the scenes of his final arrest , imprisonment , and release .

		Mr.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	, a Virginian by birth and a Yalensian by training , left his position as professor at
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	, in
Mississippi	LOCATION	, to become the private secretary of
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	.

		With deep affection for his chief , and haunting memories of him , Mr.
Har	PERSON	- rison has related the incidents of the capture of
Davis	PERSON	and his staff , and Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	has wisely incorporated portions of this narrative into her volume .

		Another dramatic incident is told in Chapter V. a journey of the young Southern girl and her aunt to
Washington	LOCATION	to carry family papers and securities , making their way over swollen streams , suffering extreme cold , hunger , and fatigue , compelled to return as prisoners of war , crossing the Rappahannock at wild flood-tide by stepping in the darkness from tie to tie on the railway bridge .

		Side-lights upon Southern gen - erals are mingled with frank confessions of ro - mantic meetings and the yearnings of girlhood for new '' finery . ''

		The omens of evil which pre - ceded the marriage of beautiful
Hetty Gary	PERSON	and General
Pegram	PERSON	, and the tragic sequel in the husband 's fatal wound three weeks after the wedding , are related with tender sympathy .

		The close of the War gave respite from the physical strain , and a feeling of gratitude that her mother and her brother , who had been a midshipman , had escaped fatalities ; but she bore a burden of great anxiety for Mr.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	during his months of solitary imprison - ment at
Fort Delaware	LOCATION	as an accomplice of Jef - ferson

		After the release of her lover she passed a year abroad with her mother , studying music and preparing for her wedding which took place at her uncle 's home in

		There are detailed descriptions of local customs , social leaders , and musical and literary clubs .

		To the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	, in proximity to
Gramercy Park	LOCATION	with its coterie of literary neighbors , came men and women of distinction in varied professions .

		The attain - ments of Mr.

		Per - sonal glimpses are given of prima donnas and actresses of earlier and later fame
Ristori	PERSON	and
Clara Louise Kellogg	PERSON	,
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, Booth and
Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	, Coquelin and Mrs.

		Besides her short stories and longer novels , like the anonymous '' Anglomaniacs '' which was one of the '' best sellers '' of its day , Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	has written skilful verses and a few successful plays , notably '' The Unwelcome Mrs.
Hatch	PERSON	. ''

		Her reminiscences include also her service on pioneer boards of hospital visitation , activities in household decorative arts and in amateur the - atricals .

		With a light pen she portrays social life in
Washington	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, and a '' Loop around

		Interesting acquaintances were also made dur - ing the three winters in southern

		And so the narrative runs on , sometimes seriously and again in the vein of kindly gossip about personalities abroad and at home , until it stops suddenly and yet naturally , with the author 's words : `` In our busy world , events go on ac - cumulating till there seems no way to call a halt in a chronicle like this save by laying down the pen ; and that I proceed to do .

		PARIS UNDER EIGHT REGIMES .

		* '' Eight regimes '' is perhaps not the way to put it since two of them were revolutionary .

		Still , the revolutionary regimen is the most try - ing of all , when you come to that .

		The essential point is that we see
Paris	LOCATION	, in the `` Recollections of a Parisian , '' through the eyes of a `` typi - cal '' Parisian .

		It follows , therefore , that Dr.
Poumies	PERSON	de la Siboutie was a provincial born coming of `` an old bourgeois stock in the town of Perigueut . ''

		Born on the eve of the great revolution , when he went up to
Paris	LOCATION	as a medi - caJ student , in
1810	DATE	, he found ruin and desola - tion . ''

		The churches and convents were dilapidated , des - serted .

		On their walls , as on those of many public build - ings , could be read the legend : `
National Property	ORGANIZATION	.

		For Sale . '

		As late as 1833 a like inscription was still to be seen in the southern tower of Notre-Dame . ''

		The young man 's disillusionizing impression of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' the city of his dreams , '' is significant , for he did not go up to the capital in the spirit of a reactionary : on the contrary his father was a republican , albeit a moderate of moderates ; and he himself had sung the stirring music of the movement `` Ca ira '' and the `` Marseil - laise . ''

		Indeed , when the time came to expel the Bourbons for the second time , the lively Doctor was only too glad to wish
Charles X.	PERSON	godspeed and to credit the good intentions of
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, for whose rule he is an apologist .

		But nothing is more interesting than the manner in which conservatism gains upon the diarist .

		He sees only crime and futility in the revolution of
1848	DATE	; and though , later on , he voted to make an emperor of the Prince-President , it is easy to see that his thought was only to steady
France	LOCATION	, that he entirely lacked enthusiasm .

		The last words in this book the last written by him , that is express the prayer : ''
May	DATE	God protect
France	LOCATION	! ''

		But this is not a `` preachy '' volume , nor one devoted to political theory .

		On the contrary , what one specifically notes about the author 's politics is his liberality his toleration , his pos - session of a degree of sweet reasonableness sel - dom matched in
France	LOCATION	.

		One enjoys , in the book , the intimate glimpses into the life of the periods to whose dramatization Balzac devoted himself : from the Revolution through the reign of the Citizen-King .

		This sen - tence suggests better than any word explanation what is the nature of these '' Recollections . ''

		They are undistinguished by phrase-making or fireworks .

		On the other hand , they are exceed - ingly well translated , and there is , besides a general index which I have put to the test , a brief biographical index .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	is a novelist who is rarely disappointing , and `` The Coil of Carne '' is one of the best books he has ever written .

		It is a fine example of the old-fashioned novel , which makes it particularly refreshing in these days when our fiction is mostly concerned with dull themes taken from contemporary life , and is too frequently disposed to run amuck among the moralities .

		Here is good romantic stuff , seized upon with zest , and vigorously fashioned into a complication that never permits our interest to flag .

		The book has many times reminded us of
Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Two Years Ago , '' and may not un - fittingly be mentioned in the same breath with that fine old specimen of healthy and warm - blooded invention .

		The period is the same , with the Crimean War for a background , and the west coast for a setting ; otherwise there is no definite resemblance .

		The story begins with the Regency , when
Denzil Carron	PERSON	of Carne , slay - ing a man in a gambling quarrel , finds his only safety in exile , and leaves
England	LOCATION	never to re - turn .

		and realizes that his hopes for his house are forever blighted by this one mad act .

		Now the son has quite recently been married , and at just this time his wife dies at
Carne	ORGANIZATION	after giving birth to a boy .

		But he has also carried on an amor - ous intrigue with the daughter of the house - keeper at Carne , who believes that she has been made the really lawful wife , and she also gives birth to a boy at about the same time .

		When Sir
Denzil	PERSON	retires to his ancestral home to pass the remainder of his days in grim seclusion from the world , he asks to see his heir , and the two boys are brought in , one by the housekeeper and the other by her daughter , and both women protest that they do not know which is which .

		There is no doubt whatever that they do know , but they keep the secret , and every effort to discover it is baffled by their stolid resistance .

		The daughter soon disappears from the scene , to reappear many years later as a famous dancer and the morganatic wife of a Russian grand duke .

		The boys are named
Jack and Jim	PERSON	, and the mystery of their parentage constitutes `` the coil of Carne . ''

		They have a neglected childhood , and are growing up as young savages , when a new curate comes to the parish , takes them in hand , and makes men of them .

		They develop in to fine specimens of manhood , generous and high-spirited , enter different arms of the service , and lay their hearts at the feet of the curate 's sister , who has grown up with them as their playmate .

		All this time , they believe themselves to be twins , and have no suspicion that there is any mystery about their parentage .

		Then comes the war in the
East	LOCATION	, and the latter third of the book tells of their part in the happen - ings of the Alma and
Balaclava	LOCATION	and
Sebastopol	LOCATION	.

		Jim is one of those who share in the wild charge of the
Light Brigade	ORGANIZATION	, and afterwards becomes a paroled prisoner in
Sebastopol	LOCATION	during the siege .

		The coil is finally cut by a bursting shell , which kills
Jack	PERSON	and tears off one of
Jim	PERSON	's arms .

		When he returns to Carne , the old housekeeper is dying , and her last delirious words are these : '' So t ' rut un 's come back , after awl ! ''

		This is as near as we ever come to the solution of the puz - zle .

		Many matters essential to the action have been omitted from this brief summary , but we have given enough to show what fine material the author has had to work with , and we wish to emphasize once more the fact that he has put it to splendid romantic use .

		The desire of a childless couple for offspring is the motive about which Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	has constructed the very voluminous novel en - titled '' The Fruitful Vine . ''

		It is not a motive
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 471 which easily lends itself to romantic treatment , and its possibilities hardly justify the five hun - dred pages which are written around and about it .

		The couple are an Englishman and his wife living in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The man has forsaken the diplomatic service in a moment of petulance he had wished an appointment to
Vienna	LOCATION	, and had been offered one at
Stockholm	LOCATION	instead and has become an idler with a gnawing ambi - tion .

		The woman is an enigmatical beauty , who feels that she can not retain her husband 's love unless she bears him a son , and , that con - summation failing , plunges into bridge and other social distractions .

		This is the situation which is interminably prolonged until the woman at last succumbs to temptation , and enters into an intrigue with an Italian lover .

		A child is born , and Sir
Theodore	PERSON	supposes it to be his own .

		Then the mother dies , and the truth comes out .

		The shock of this discovery is modified for Sir Theodore by the realization that his wife 's fault had resulted from an excess of wifely de - votion , and , conscious of his own shortcomings in the marital relations , he cries , '' She was bet - ter than I , '' and there the story ends .

		As an intimate picture of Roman society , done in great detail , the book is a pronounced success , of much the same sort that was achieved by
Marion Crawford	PERSON	in the same field .

		It has both truth of fact and distinction of style , but it is lacking in the passionate sweep and poetic charm that the author has been able to put into the better of his previous works .

		For a quiet study of Scotch character , relieved by humorous glints , a good deal is to be said for Mr.
Gilbert Watson	PERSON	's `` Toddie . ''

		The scene is
St. Andrews	LOCATION	, and
Toddie	ORGANIZATION	is the major 's caddie .

		Both are misogynists , but the major shows signs of weakening , and Toddie views with alarm his master 's increasing intimacy with Miss Charity of the manse .

		Her maid
Devina	LOCATION	is also much concerned about the symptoms ex - hibited by her mistress , and enters into an offen - sive and defensive alliance with Toddie to avert the threatened matrimonial calamity .

		But the outcome is that Toddie and Devina learn some - thing new about themselves , and each of them gives up his most cherished convictions about the other sex .

		After this defection from the de - fence , there is nothing for it but that the major and Miss Charity should also pair off .

		The two - fold complication is thus straightened out , and the manner in which it is done is both deft and beguiling .

		The chief artistic defect of Mr.
Arnold Ben	PERSON	- nett 's '' Clayhanger , '' as we pointed out at the time of that book 's appearance , was its failure to account for
Hilda	PERSON	's mysterious conduct in de - serting
Edwin	PERSON	just after they had exchanged the pledges of their mutual love .

		A brief note in - formed the latter that the writer was married to one
George Cannon	PERSON	, whose name was thus first brought to our attention , and the later accounts of
Hilda	PERSON	's life as the keeper of a lodging-house in
Brighton	LOCATION	gave us to understand that her hus - band had been a criminal and had left her to look after herself .

		We were informed at the close that a second novel would clear up the mystery , dovetailing the experiences of
Edwin	PERSON	and
Hilda	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has now kept his promise by writing ``
Hilda Lessways	PERSON	, '' from which we learn that the heroine had been infatuated with
George Cannon	PERSON	from her early girlhood , that she had been secretly married to him , and that it was just after her discovery that her husband had another wife still living that she had yielded to
Edwin	PERSON	's suit .

		This is a little puzzling , for
Edwin Clayhanger	PERSON	had never heard the name of
George Cannon	ORGANIZATION	, although the latter had lived for many years in the neighborhood , and had become rather notorious in more ways than one .

		So the mys - tery turns out to have been nothing more than a tricky device on the part of the author to keep the interest in suspense , and necessitate the writ - ing of a second book by way of explanation .

		Of this second book , we are bound to say that , while it solves the original puzzle , it does so in a rather commonplace fashion , and by no means gives us a counterpart of '' Clayhanger '' either in psy - chological penetration or in sympathetic delinea - tion .

		This '' Ring-and-the-Book '' method of telling the same story from the view points of different observers is not justifiable unless each new version comes to us as a fresh and vital crea - tion .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has flagged upon the second `` lap , '' and his ''
Hilda Lessways	PERSON	'' is distinctly disappointing .

		It makes the impression of a task perfunctorily performed , and is stretched out to the desired length by a forcing process in which resort is had to a great deal of insignificant ma - terial .

		Particularly , it carries beyond all rea - sonable bounds the device of accompanying the act and the spoken word by a statement of the unuttered thought .

		We should say that nearly one-half of
Hilda	PERSON	's words here printed within inverted commas were not spoken at all , but were only the thoughts that flitted across her con - sciousness .

		This sort of thing may be psychologi - cally effective if it is done sparingly , but some - thing should be left to the imagination , and the stuff becomes mere padding as the author here makes use of it .

		We should still think `` Hilda 472 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Lessways '' a novel of remarkable power were we not compelled to match it all the time with the extraordinarily high standard of achievement set up by its two great predecessors ; it simply falls far short of meeting the test when that in - evitable comparison is made .

		There is yet to be a third novel in completion of the series , and that , we trust , will reveal once more the conscien - tious artistry and the high creative faculty that proved so overwhelming in '' Clay hanger `` and The Old Wives ' Tale . ''

		The rectory which is the home of the Rev.
Brian Vereker	PERSON	is a very humble abode , for the parish stipend is small , but it is made cheerful by six engaging children having as many pro- nounced individualities .

		They are motherless , and the household cares rest chiefly upon the shoulders of the eldest girl ,
Daphne	PERSON	, who is still in her teens .

		It is difficult to make both ends meet , but the family all regard poverty as an exhilarating game rather than as a crushing bur - den .

		Upon them one day descends in his auto - mobile Deus ex machina Sir
John Carr	PERSON	, in boyhood days fag of the Rev.
Brian	PERSON	, and now pit-owner , captain of industry , and Member of parliament .

		He comes , and he lingers ; for aphne , owning less than half his years , allures , m , and before he departs she is his affianced ^ fe .

		It is a rather cold-blooded arrangement , '' e cause the girl 's chief reason for accepting his s uit is that she may be able to provide for the younger members of her family .

		This explains why Mr.
Ian Hay	PERSON	has chosen '' A Safety Match '' for the title of his story .

		The mar - riage does not work very well for a time , be - cause the wife 's nature has now been really awakened , and because the husband has for so long cultivated self-control that is not easy for him to unbend .

		There comes a period of es - trangement , and the wife even indulges in a little mild flirtation ; but she is sound at heart , and when Sir
John	PERSON	's character is at last revealed to her , she makes up for all her previous lack of wifely affection It takes a tragedy to work this consummation , for Sir John is blinded by an ex - plosion in the coal mine which he has entered at great personal risk to save the lives of his im - perilled men .

		One of the best things about this book is its dealing with the vexed problems of labor agitation .

		There is no sentimentality in the discussion , but instead clear-sighted judg - ment and kindly humor .

		There is humor , in fact , everywhere , of the sparkling rather than the gleaming variety , and it makes the book de - lightful to read .

		Strikes are much the same sort of thing , whether they are of colliery men in
England	LOCATION	, or of garment - workers in
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is from one of these cases to the other that we turn when we take up the story which Mr.
James Oppenheim	PERSON	has called ' ' The Nine-tenths . ' '

		Here we have , not an objective view of the matter , but a situation skilfully devised for the purpose of special pleading no humor , but an overplus of sentimentality .

		Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	is dreadfully in earnest , and his vivid picture of the suffering of the poor makes a strong appeal to our sympa - thies for the time being , but reflection soon shows that his judgment is biassed , and that the prac - tices he approves of are inimical to the sacred principle of individual liberty .

		The story opens with a description of a fire horror in a printing establishment .

		The proprietor is made frantic by the disaster , and , although fairly chargeable with nothing more than contributory negligence , feels himself guilty of murder .

		His one idea is now to devote the rest of his life to the better - ment of the working-classes , and so he goes to live in the slums , publishes a socialist newspaper , and becomes a leader in the social warfare of class against class .

		Incidentally , he well-nigh breaks the heart of the girl to whom he has just become engaged ; for , instead of seeking help in her com - panionship and sympathy , he just deserts her , and leaves her with nothing but her shattered hopes .

		Thefactthat she forgives him , and comes to him in the end , does not make his previous conduct any more excusable .

		The best we can do for him in this connection is to make the chari - table assumption that his mind was unhinged for the time being .

		In this book realism is car - ried rather far in the matter of both description and dialogue , and , in general , we are offered photography rather than artistic vision .

		A mellow tale which is also a trifle melodra - matic of the South in the forties and fifties , is provided by Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's ''
Ken	PERSON	- nedy Square . ''

		The chief figure in this story is
St. George Temple	ORGANIZATION	, a dear quixotic gentleman of the old school , embodying those fine ideals of courtesy and honor which the author would have us believe were characteristic of good
Southern	ORGANIZATION	society half a century ago , and which have almost disappeared from our newer civilization .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has preached to us in this strain many times before , but never with greater fervor of expression .

		And making all proper allowances for the spectacles through which we are apt to view a long vanished past , we have no doubt that life had a more gracious aspect in those bygone days than it presents to us in this bustling new century .

George	PERSON	is buffeted by fortune in

		THE DIAL 473 a way that reminds us of Job , but the sweetness of his temper remains unaffected by adversity , and neither illness nor poverty can rob him of his dignity and poise .

		His misfortunes follow , in a measure , from his affection for young
Harry Rutter	PERSON	, the ostensible hero , whose hot blood gets him into a duel , in consequence whereof , although his antagonist is only wounded , his fatherdisowns him and his sweetheart casts him off .

		It takes some five hundred pages to close this double breach , for both pride and obstinacy have to be overcome at the cost of much heroic endeavor .

		Both father and sweetheart suffer a good deal in the process , but they seem fairly to deserve the chastening .

		An interesting but rather irrelevant episode introduces
Poe	PERSON	among the characters , and makes a cruel exhibit of his besetting weak - ness .

		The whole story is related in leisurely fashion , and is drenched with harmless senti - mentality .

		In the end
St. George	ORGANIZATION	's fortunes are restored , the lovers are brought together , and the father becomes reconciled to his son , which is all that anyone could wish to happen . ''

		The Iron Woman , '' by Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	, is in a certain sense a sequel to '' The Awakening of
Helena Richie	PERSON	. ''

		At least Mrs.
Richie	PERSON	, in beautiful middle age , chastened by experience and the cleansing fires of spiritual conflict , occupies an important place in the new scheme of things , and
David	PERSON	, now on the verge of manhood , is still by her side .

		He is a new
David	PERSON	, not altogether what we should have an - ticipated from the boy who won such a hold up - on our affections , but probably a more natural and human figure .

		The scene is shifted to an - other
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	town a town which has its excuse for being in the iron works of which the widowed Mrs.
Maitland	PERSON	is both owner and manager .

		There are two children
Blair	PERSON	and
Nannie	PERSON	in the
Maitland	LOCATION	household , the fruit of the widow 's two marriages .

		Then there is
Elizabeth Ferguson	PERSON	, orphaned and living near by in the care of her uncle
Robert Ferguson	PERSON	, who is the superintendent of the works .

		Thus we have the group of four young persons and three elders about whose fortunes the story is constructed .

		Elizabeth is the
Helen	PERSON	of the tale , being the prize contested for by both
David	PERSON	and
Blair	PERSON	after they have grown old enough to make the amazing discovery that girls are something more than playmates .

		Unfortunately ,
Elizabeth	PERSON	has a very bad temper ; and that is the cause of her undoing .

		Her repentance is as violent as her rage , but repentance is of no avail when she has cast off
David	PERSON	, who is her accepted lover , and hastily married
Blair	PERSON	in a moment of pique .

		How completely the mischief is done will be clear to all who know the author 's stern philoso - phy on the subject of the marriage-bond .

		Elizabeth has given herself to a worthless man , and her love for
David	PERSON	is the central fact of her life ; but the thing is irrevocable .

		The story works up to a powerful climax in which
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, learning how despicable is her hus - band , is on the point of taking refuge in
David	PERSON	's arms , when she is saved by Mrs.
Richie	PERSON	's inter - vention , whose confession of the misstep that had clouded her own past brings about the necessary revulsion of feeling .

		It is a sort of salvation that many readers will question , so strongly will their sympathies have been enlisted on the side of the lovers , and so loose is the current philosophy of individualism upon this subject ; but we can - not soberly deny that it is a real salvation , based upon the most fundamental principles of social solidarity .

		We have said nothing thus far about '' the iron woman '' who gives the novel its title , and yet it is she who dominates all the phases of the complication , and has for us a deeper interest than any of the younger people , or than
Helena Richie	PERSON	.

		Her grim unlovely exterior at first re - pels , until we gradually become awareof the pas - sionate heart beneath , with its unsatisfied yearn - ing for sympathy and comprehension , and its powerlessness to express what is best and deepest in her nature .

		This figure is indeed a triumph of characterization , and assures for its creator a place among the masters .

		As for the richness of the whole book in clear-sighted observation and broad sympathy and wise criticism of the conduct of life , no formal statement can be any - where nearly adequate to convey more than an inconsiderable fraction of the truth .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		PROFESSOR
RAYMOND MACDONALD ALDEN	PERSON	has com - piled , and the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published , a book of '' Readings in the English Prose of the

		More than two score authors are illustrated altogether , and judicious annota - tion helps to their understanding without unduly swell - ing the contents of the volume .

		The editor draws two `` morals '' from the study which the work has cost him : first , that the eighteenth century seemed just as degen - erate , and for much the same reasons , to those who lived in it , as the twentieth century does to us ; second , that Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was its greatest figure , deserving all the respect that we are likely to accord him , and even more .

		i. BOOKS OF TKAVEL AND DESCRIPTION .

		Broadway historically and descriptively treated , and Broadway impressionistically and imaginatively depicted , are the respective themes of two note - worthy books conceived simultaneously but inde - pendently , and now making their appearance for all those who wish to be diverted and instructed by con - templating the wonders of the longest and richest and most spectacular street in the world .

		Mr.
Stephen Jenkins	PERSON	makes prominent this superlative attribute of the famous thoroughfare by entitling his learned and detailed study '' The Greatest Street in the World : The Story of Broadway , Old and New , from Bowling Green to
Albany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		He is a member of the
Westchester County	LOCATION	His - torical Society , and has for ten or more years been lecturing in
New York	LOCATION	and elsewhere on the his - tory of Broadway and its more important landmarks .

		Now the lecture is expanded into an octavo of five hundred pages , with one hundred and sixty views and six maps .

		The work is thoroughly well done , and in its pages one can journey from
Bowling Green	ORGANIZATION	to
Albany	LOCATION	far more observantly and intelli - gently than by motor-car or other conveyance .

		Mr.
J. B. Kerfoot	PERSON	's volume , entitled simply '' Broadway '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , makes its appeal to the imagination and the aesthetic sense .

		He calls himself an impres - sionist , and both reading matter and illustrations -LRB- supplied by Mr.
Lester G. Hornby	PERSON	-RRB- are of the im - pressionist school .

		The bigness and the busy-ness and the varied picturesqueness of Broadway are im - pressed upon the reader by both author and artist .

		Forty-three well-executed drawings , each a full-page plate , make the work notable among the illustrated books of the season .

		In typography , paper , and binding , the volume is of the best workmanship .

		That
Brussels	LOCATION	and
Antwerp	LOCATION	are not all of
Belgium	LOCATION	, or even the most characteristic and variously inter - esting part , becomes evident upon reading u Some Old Flemish Towns , '' described and depicted by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	.

		After a most read - able chapter on Flemish characteristics there follow not less informing and humanly interesting ac - counts of Oudenaarde ,
Alost	LOCATION	,
Dendermonde	LOCATION	,
Ypres	LOCATION	,
Tournai	LOCATION	,
Lille	LOCATION	,
Bruges	LOCATION	,
Douai	LOCATION	,
Ghent	LOCATION	, and other little-visited cities of the wide well-watered plain between the French and the Dutch boundaries .

		It may not be generally known that there is a flour - ishing school of literary workers in the Flemish tongue , and their researches seem to be resulting in a complete reconstruction of the history of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the Belgians as a class are not great readers of books .

		The newspapers satisfy their desire for printed matter , and consequently the poets and nov - elists have to write in some other than the Flemish language in order to find a market for their wares .

		Mr.
Ed	PERSON	wards 's illustrations , some in variegated hues , others in monochrome , are numerous and good .

		Both front cover and title-page are brilliant with coats of arms and other ornamentation .

Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Visitors to the British Museum are told the num - ber of miles of shelving in the library , how many times the books would belt the globe if laid end to end , how high they would reach if piled upon each other ; and at last they are overwhelmed by the statement that , vast as the accumulation is , it is increasing at the rate of twenty thousand volumes every year .

		Something of the same method of challenging atten - tion by means of the stupendous and imposing is adopted by Mr.
Calvert	PERSON	in his book on
Spain	LOCATION	a large and glorious picture-book , in two quarto vol - umes , conspicuous in red and gold .

		There are over seventeen hundred illustrations , many of them full or half page , including some fifty colored plates from the brush of Mr.

		In his preface , the author says : '' It is from pictures rather than the text that I hope to gain for my book the commenda - tion of the public .

		... As the pages multiplied , the value of the pictorial side became more apparent , with the result that what was commenced as an illus - trated book upon
Spain	LOCATION	has become an album of Spanish views and objects , supplemented with a run - ning commentary of explanation or appreciation of historical and archaeological data . ''

		It is as a pic - ture book chiefly that the work is to be judged ; and we may safely say that no album of Spanish views surpasses it in magnificence .

		The photographs are both excellent and well selected , showing us all of
Spain	LOCATION	in rapid and brilliant panorama .

		The mea - greness of the text will readily be forgiven after reading a few samples of guide-book descriptions and historical matter .

		Much of it has been published before by Mr.
Calvert	PERSON	in his '' Spanish Series . ''

		All , or nearly all , of the photographs seem to be the same as those that he has given us in the former volumes , although here they appear upon a larger and fairer page .

		The lover of fine books will delight in this beautiful work .

		Four strikingly attractive volumes dealing with British rural scenes and rural characters , and appro - priately illustrated in color by competent artists , are issued by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' English Country Life , '' by Mr.
Walter Raymond	PERSON	, is an inti - mately familiar account of the peculiarities of

		Char - acters like Uncle
Dick	PERSON	, Old Abe ,
Micah Dodge	PERSON	, Our Ursie , Mrs.
Dark	PERSON	, and
Phil Davy	PERSON	, give life and veri - similitude and a genuine rusticity to the short and spirited chapters .

		THE DIAL 475 responsible for the worthy Mr.
Balwhidder	PERSON	and the events of his useful life in
Ayrshire	LOCATION	.

		The kirk is , of course , next to its minister , the centre of interest in the story , which abounds in character-sketches and incidents of the genuine `` kailyard '' description .

		The chronicler closes with '' a blessing on all people from on high , where I soon hope to be , and to meet there all the old and long-departed sheep of my flock , especially the first and second Mrs.
Balwhidders	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Mackenzie Macbride	PERSON	's '' Arran of the Bens , the
Glens	LOCATION	, and the Brave '' deals with the romantically beautiful but hitherto seldom visited little island just across the
Firth	PERSON	of Clyde from
Ayr	ORGANIZATION	.

		The his - tory and antiquities and traditions of
Arran	ORGANIZATION	, with a chapter each to
Wallace	PERSON	and
Bruce	PERSON	, and appropriate mention of the island 's scenic attractions , fill out the volume , which is illustrated by Mr.
J. Lawton Wingate	PERSON	,
R.S.A. Arran	ORGANIZATION	and its folklore and its unsophisticated ways have recently furnished inspi - ration to
John Synge	PERSON	and to Lady
Gregory	PERSON	for play-writing purposes , as the Irish Players have so lately made evident to us . ''

		The Pageant of the Forth , '' by Mr.
Stewart Dick	PERSON	, with twenty-four colored illustrations by about half as many different Scottish artists , has to do with a part of the country very near to
Arran	ORGANIZATION	and to Ayr .

		Edinburgh and
Leith	PERSON	,
Stirling	PERSON	and
Dunfermline	ORGANIZATION	,
Kirkaldy	PERSON	and
St. Monans	LOCATION	, and other places of historic interest , fill the pages with readable matter .

		The pictures , though small , are excellent .

		Most of the places included in Mr.
Egerton R. Williams	PERSON	's '' Plain-towns of
Italy	LOCATION	: The Cities of Old Venetia '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have been so little written about by English or American authors as to give his handsome and scholarly volume , the fruit of '' three years of continuous study , travel , and labor , '' a fresh and very inviting appearance among the numerous travel books of the season .

		History and legend , topography , art , and architecture , with useful hints to intending tourists , make up a volume of six hun - dred pages , illustrated with half a hundred views , some of them photographed by the author and pre - senting scenes and objects probably never before focussed by the camera .

		Among the towns that fig - .

		ure most conspicuously in Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's pages ; are
Padua	LOCATION	,
Verona	LOCATION	,
Brescia	LOCATION	,
Vicenza	LOCATION	,
Treviso	LOCATION	, and
Bassano	PERSON	.

		All other pursuits were abandoned by him in order to visit
Italy	LOCATION	and prepare this companion volume to his '' Hill-towns of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' issued eight years ago .

		The peculiar interest of the scenes vis - ited and the book describing them is thus indicated in the preface : '' Fascinating , however , as are the countless artistic masterpieces and the picturesque architectural dress of these towns of the Veneto , in - teresting as are their historical and literary relics and associations , there is still more to interest the stranger , in the natural scenery of their settings and countrysides , and the marked diversity of their appearance , customs , and inhabitants .

		Let no one associate them , because they are plain-towns , with the ideas of sameness or monotony . ''

		Mr.
James Bone	PERSON	, being a
Glasgow	LOCATION	man but at the same time an ardent lover of historic
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, thinks himself sufficiently '' detached and alien '' to view the latter city with something of the impar - tiality of a foreigner , and so , as it were , to identify his opinions with those of a dispassionate posterity .

		His `` Edinburgh Revisited '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- takes the reader on a pleasant ramble through the most inter - esting parts of the town , while seventy-five pen-and - ink drawings , both full-page and smaller , by Mr.
Hanslip Fletcher	PERSON	, greatly aid the imagination in this personally-conducted promenade .

		Curious his - torical incidents and scraps of myth and legend enrich the vivacious pages of the book .

		An almost unknown
Bunker	ORGANIZATION	's Hill in the
New Town	LOCATION	is the subject of a half-forgotten story .

		A chapter on ghosts ministers to the love of the weird and the hair-raising . ''

		There is a peculiar gusto and smack , '' says the author , '' in the intimate details of many of the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	legends of horror that argue sharp pleasures of the imagination , as though the sensuousness of a people narrowly restrained by a religion that forbade colour and ritual , and a climate grudging of warmth and fruit , had turned inward for dainty feeding . ''

		In its generous pro- portions , substantial paper , large print , wide mar - gins , and , above all , its pictures full of character and '' atmosphere , '' the book 's appearance does jus - tice to its literary contents .

		So well and favorably known is Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's '' Highways and Byways Series '' that little need here be said in description of his `` High - ways and Byways of the Great Lakes '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , which conducts one most agreeably through parts of rural
Pennsylania	LOCATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, and
Ohio	LOCATION	, and af - fords a few glimpses of
Canada	LOCATION	, especially along the
Detroit River	LOCATION	.

		Sixty-three views , chosen with an eye for the distinctive and the picturesque , and clearly reproduced from the author 's photographs , illustrate the fifteen chapters of the book .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	enters into frequent conversation with the natives , and his pages are full of native humor .

		One inhabitant of a not too fertile region on the shores of Lake Superior reluctantly admitted that potatoes could be grown there , but added , `` I think the farmers ' best chance is to raise grasshoppers and sell the hops . ''

		As in other volumes of the series , brief notes for the guidance of travellers are ap - pended to each chapter .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has become an expert in the kind of unconventional travel - book he so successfully writes and illustrates , and he is certainly helping on the cause whose familiar watch - word is `` See your own country first . '' ''

		They are quite out of the world , '' said one travel - led Briton to certain others of less experience , refer - ring to the
Balearic Isles	LOCATION	; '' there are no tourists ; not a soul understands a word of English ; and there 's nothing whatever to do .

		If you take my advice you won ' t go . '' ''

		So we went . ''

Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Mary Stuart Boyd	PERSON	, who , with artist-husband and son , enjoyed some weeks of unwonted experience among the primitive people of those sleepy and pic - turesque
Mediterranean	LOCATION	islands .

		Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	-LRB-
A. S. Boyd	PERSON	, R.S.W. -RRB- ably seconds with brush and pencil -LRB- or pen it seems to be in this instance -RRB- his wife 's suc - cessful attempts to convey some adequate and pleas - ing notion of Balearic manners and customs and buildings and scenery .

		Mrs.
Boyd	PERSON	is the second adventurous soul this year to invade these islands with book-making intent , Mr.
J. E. Crawford Flitch	PERSON	-LRB- whose '' Mediterranean Moods '' was reviewed in THE DIAL of
August 16	DATE	-RRB- being slightly ahead of her in bringing forth the fruit of his observant travels .

		Eight brilliant color pictures , unmistakably Spanish in their atmosphere , and fifty-two pen drawings , both full-page and of smaller size , help the reader to trans - port himself to the '' Fortunate Isles . ''

		Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	might almost be called an Italianized Englishman , so many years -LRB- more than twenty by this time -RRB- has he lived in the country of his choice , so familiar has he made himself with the language and the habits of the natives , and so largely have his studies and writings concerned themselves with Italian subjects .

		His latest book he entitles '' My Italian Year , '' apparently because he is no hasty visitor , but an all-the-y ear-rounder in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He begins with some emphatic comments on the ordinary English or American resident 's igno - rance of the people among whom he lives his ignorance of the language , of the temperament , of the point of view of the emotional and demonstra - tive Latins whom he meets , but with whom he is unable or unwilling to mingle .

		Such defects of comprehension and sympathy Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	seems to have corrected in himself , living as he has lived for more than half a lifetime '' almost exclusively among Italians of all classes . ''

		Hence his book in - spires confidence , and one follows with satisfaction and profit his revelations and explanations of the true inwardness of things Italian .

		He begins with northern
Italy	LOCATION	, passes through
Tuscany	LOCATION	to
Rome	LOCATION	, introduces us to the Neopolitans , or vice versa , lin - gers in
Magna Grecia	LOCATION	, and is ever full of instruc - tive observation on matters of either current or more lasting interest .

		Good illustrations from pho - tographs abound .

		The book , handsomely bound and neatly boxed , is published in this country by
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The life and color of
Spain	LOCATION	may fairly be said to throb and glow in Mr.
Edward Penfield	PERSON	's '' Spanish Sketches '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a book of most generous typo - graphy and spacious margins , of rapidly-delineated scenes and incidents , and of vivid illustrations in the heightened tints that serve well to emphasize the exotic character of the surroundings into whose midst the reader is transported .

		The color effects rather than the drawing of the artist-author especially impress us , and his three chapters of narrative , '' Between Towns in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' '' Spanish Impressions , '' and '' A Bull Fight , '' are good reading , except that the horrors of the national pastime will inspire in many a greater aversion than they seem to in the author , whose humanity tends to fall a victim to his art-instinct in watching the stirring spectacle .

		A twenty years ' residence in
Scotland	LOCATION	and frequent journeyings through that land of scenic beauty and historic and legendary interest have qualified Miss
Josephine Helena Short	PERSON	to put her hand to another book of Scottish travel . ''

		Chosen Days in
Scotland	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- comprises twenty-one chapters of
Highland	LOCATION	and Lowland rambling and reminiscence , with a con - siderable section devoted to
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and its liter - ary associations , and some agreeable pages descriptive of
Scott	PERSON	's country , with appropriate extracts from Scottish poets .

		The Orkneys and the
Isle of Skye	ORGANIZATION	, off the travelled route of tourists , are visited by
Miss Short	PERSON	, who tastefully illustrates her volume with numerous views , chiefly the product of her own cam - era .

		The book is both a guide for the traveller and a fireside entertainer for the stay-at-home .

		Books about the French capital are always with us , but that by
G. Duval	PERSON	, illustrated by
J. Gavin	PERSON	, and entitled '' Shadows of Old
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , differs from most of the rest in deserving shelfroom and a reading .

		A good deal of history is tucked away in its pages , and the learning which this represents is produced in no ostentatious manner , though with proper gusto .

		Letter-press and pictures bear a well-balanced relation , and
M. Gavin	PERSON	's etchings and pen-sketches are both compe - tently and lovingly executed .

		Though this is ,
Dieii	PERSON	merci , an old-fashioned kind of place-book , its col - laborators show something of youthful zest in their representations of the Palais Royal , '' Les Carmes , '' the Palais des
Vosges	LOCATION	,
St. Gervais	LOCATION	, the Seine ,
Mont	PERSON	- martre , and the
Narais	PERSON	.

		Some of the chapters sug - gest in their titles nothing of the topographic :
Ninon de Lenclos	PERSON	, the
Marquise de Brinvilliers	PERSON	, the
Sorcer	PERSON	- ers , the Inns -LRB- and not always
Paris	LOCATION	inns alone -RRB- , fur - nish excellent subject-matter .

		Some readers will rejoice that only the frontispiece is in colors ! ''


California	LOCATION	the Beautiful '' repeats a novel experi - ment in book-making of a year ago .

		Some will re - member `` The Vanished Ruin Era , '' Mr.
Louis J. Stellman	PERSON	's portrayal , in photo-print and verse , of
San Francisco	LOCATION	's more picturesque ruins after the great earthquake and fire .

		In the same way , some of the more striking bits of scenic and architectural Cali - fornia now challenge the artist-photographer 's skill , while accompanying each picture are one or two selec - tions , in prose or verse , mostly from western writers , the whole compiled by Mr.
Paul Elder	PERSON	and published by his well-known house .

		As in the earlier work , each illustration , in brownish tint , is mounted on the right-hand page , the left being devoted to literature .

		Stiff brown paper is used , a stout buckram-and-board binding matches it , and a suitable brown pasteboard box encloses the whole .

		Among the many authors quoted , there fail not to appear the familiar names of
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	,
George Wharton James	PERSON	,

		THE DIAL 477
Atherton	PERSON	,
John Muir	PERSON	,
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	,
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	,
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	, and others .

		The pictures , by a number of photographers , are well chosen and executed .

		Intelligent enthusiasm for
Italy	LOCATION	and the Italians breathes in the well-written pages of Mrs.
Tryphosa Bates	PERSON	-
Batcheller	PERSON	's truly sumptuous volume on '' Ital - ian Castles and Country Seats '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		`` The rare good fortune has been given to me , '' she writes , '' not only to see many of the most beautiful villas of
Italy	LOCATION	, but to be lavishly and comfortably entertained by their hospitable owners whom I am happy to be able to call my friends .

		My preparations for this present book have been a round of joyous happen - ings , and if my opinions of
Italy	LOCATION	and the Italians are enthusiastic , it is because I must write of a country as I see it , and of a people as I find them . ''

		Enjoy - ing the acquaintance of the royal family and many other persons of distinction in
Italy	LOCATION	, she takes her readers into the best society with a generosity un - equalled except in
Ouida	LOCATION	's gorgeous romances .

		Truly it is good reading , and has more verisimilitude than the Ouida novel .

		The narrative assumes the intimate form of letters to the writer 's mother , and is helped out with innumerable views and portraits , some of the former being delicately colored .

		A fine photo - graphic likeness of
Queen Margherita	PERSON	, to whom the volume is dedicated by permission , faces the title-page .

		The reigning king and queen and many beautiful exteriors and interiors of luxurious country seats are further subjects for the illustrator 's art ; and our present President 's cheerful countenance ap - pears near the end , he being among the fortunate author 's illustrious friends .

		The appeal of
Italy	LOCATION	's blue skies and smiling land - scapes and splendid architecture is a strong one as made through the pages and the pictures of Mr.
W. W. Collins	PERSON	's Cathedral Cities of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein the author conducts his readers from Como in the north to Palermo in the south , giving them views and descriptions of twenty-five his - toric towns , each famous for one or more cathedrals .

		It is the Renaissance architecture especially that the artist-author seems inclined to regard as '' the most intimate expression of the Italian spirit . ''

		Accord - ingly , the works of Brunellesco ,
Michelozzo	PERSON	, and
Cronaca	LOCATION	, at
Florence	LOCATION	, of
Palladio	ORGANIZATION	at
Venice	LOCATION	, and
Vicenza	LOCATION	, of
Bramante	PERSON	and , above all , of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	at
Rome	LOCATION	, he particularly admires , while such examples of the Gothic as the cathedrals at
Como	ORGANIZATION	and
Genoa	LOCATION	and
Milan	LOCATION	elicit less enthusiasm .

		The bright and sunny pictures from the author 's brush do not confine themselves to cathedrals .

		The
Ponte Vecchio	ORGANIZATION	at
Florence	LOCATION	, the Bay of
Naples	LOCATION	, the Isle of
S. Bartolommeo	PERSON	, the
Arch of Titus	ORGANIZATION	, the market-place of
Verona	LOCATION	, and other picturesque or historically in - teresting scenes are depicted .

		The book is of rich appearance , without and within .

		Unusually well executed are the colored illustra - tions , by Mr.
Douglas Snowdon	PERSON	, to `` The Belgians at Home '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a book whose author , Mr.
Clive Holland	PERSON	, `` deals with
Belgium	LOCATION	and its people , '' as he tells us , '' from the point of view of a rambler who has at various times cycled and trav - elled many hundreds of miles along its highways and by-ways , and has sought to learn something of its past history , greatness and romance , and to see many of its greatest architectural and art treasures in most of its known , and some of its comparatively unknown , towns and villages . ''

		Mr.
Holland	PERSON	uses his camera freely and skilfully to illustrate further these highway and byway rambles , thus presenting a volume not unlike , in some respects , the American `` Highways and Byways Series '' of Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	.

		An outline of Belgian history from the earliest times to the present forms the opening chap - ter , after which come descriptions of the people and good accounts of the more interesting places , both seaside and inland .

		Ghent ,
Bruges	LOCATION	,
Waterloo	LOCATION	,
Louvain	LOCATION	, Malines these and other names , not to mention
Brussels	LOCATION	and
Antwerp	LOCATION	, catch even a cursory reader 's eye and promise no little entertainment in the chapters devoted to the romance , the charm , and the varied historic , artistic , and architectural attractions of these storied towns and villages .

		The beautiful blue
Danube	ORGANIZATION	has thus far inspired fewer poets and exercised the pens of fewer travel - lers than has the romantic Rhine .

		But with in - creased facilities for making the descent of the longer river , that too should become the theme of both imaginative and realistic composition .

		Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	, in his book , `` The Danube '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , calls that stream more beautiful , grander , and more fascinating than the storied Rhine .

		How well he jus - tifies the assertion it remains for the reader to de - termine by following his course from Donauesching - en to the Black Sea , as described in detail under four heads , '' The Upper Danube , '' '' The Austrian Danube , '' `` The Hungarian Danube , '' and `` The Lower Danube . ''

		Mr.
Louis Weirter	PERSON	contributes thirty beautiful drawings , twelve of them in the hues of nature and presenting the appearance of delicate water-colors . ''

		Imperial Danube 's rich domain , '' as
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	styles it , has received sympathetic treat - ment from both artist and author .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF OLD FAVORITES .

		The poet
Rogers	PERSON	, at one of his famous breakfasts , is said to have recited from memory more than a page from
Dana	PERSON	's '' Two Years before the Mast , '' as a bit of American prose which , he thought , had '' more poetry in it than almost any modern verse . ''

		Extracts from the book have been chosen by
United States	LOCATION	oculists for use in the testing of eyes , because of the work 's clearness of style and freedom from long words .

		This deservedly popular classic , which was sold outright by its young author for two hun - dred and fifty dollars , and which achieved an aston - ishing circulation both at home and abroad , was bought back by him twenty-eight years after and re-issued with an additional chapter .

		The present season brings forth two independent reprints of the work .

		The author 's son , the third
Richard Henry Dana	PERSON	, edits an elaborately illustrated edition , to 478 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, which he adds some most interesting prefatory mat - ter and a supplementary chapter entitled '' Seventy - six Years After . ''

		The
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	, successors to the publishers of the author 's edition of
1869	DATE	, publish the present edition , while Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	provides the excellent colored illus - trations .

		Useful diagrams are appended showing the several parts of a ship and its equipment , with the technical names , also an index and other valu - able matter .

		The other re-issue of the engrossing narrative bears the
Macmillan	PERSON	imprint , and is a fine piece of book-making .

		An introduction is furnished by Dr.
Wilfred Grenfell	PERSON	, himself a one-time deep - sea fisherman in the old-fashioned sailing craft that have now largely given place to `` tin kettles , '' as
Jack	PERSON	Tar contemptuously styled the innovation .

		Mr.
Charles Pears	PERSON	illustrates the book with spirited drawings in color .

		Pickwick the ever-popular , Pickwick the peren - nially amusing , whom age can not wither nor custom stale , reappears in festive array to add to the merri - ment of the Christmas season .

		Mr.
Cecil Aldin	PERSON	has designed twenty-four full-page plates in color , and nearly a hundred smaller drawings in black and white , to embellish a two-volume edition , in large octavo , of '' The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In depicting the comical , in de - tails of facial expression , in catching a ludicrous atti - tude or a laughter-provoking situation , Mr.
Aldin	PERSON	shows himself a master not unworthy of a place in the immortal company of those earlier Dickens illus - trators ,
Cruikshank	PERSON	and
Seymour	PERSON	,
H. K. Browne	PERSON	-LRB- `` Phiz '' -RRB- and
Barnard	PERSON	, Frost and
Dalziel	PERSON	, and the other gifted draughtsmen who helped to make the '' Household Edition '' of the novelist 's works so great a success forty-two years ago .

		So full of character are Mr.
Aldin	PERSON	's designs that they needed no addi - tion of lively colors to win approval , however much demanded thataddition is by the present mode .

		Paper , print , and binding , all are on the sumptuous order in this notable centenary edition -LRB- as it may be called -RRB- of
Dickens	PERSON	's early masterpiece .

		No more tastefully illustrated book of verse could be desired than the elaborately artistic edition of Shelley 's '' Sensitive Plant , '' edited by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, illustrated with much richness of coloring and gracefulness of design by Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	, and imported by the
Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's introduction throws new light on the '' Lady , the wonder of her kind , '' who played the part of `` an Eve in this Eden '' where grew the sensitive plant .

		Drawing upon
Medwin	ORGANIZATION	's notes to a never-published second edition of his life of the poet , he tells us that this paragon of her sex was a certain Countess of Mountcashell , an Irish lady about fifty years of age , of sufficient unconventionality to be welcomed by
Shelley	PERSON	and his company as a congenial spirit .

		The notes on this lady and the editor 's gleaning of facts concerning the mimosa pudica , or sensitive plant , celebrated by the poet , are interesting .

		The illustrations , large and small , accompanying the slen - der thread of text , form the conspicuous feature of the book , and make it one of the most sumptuous gift volumes of the year .

		The cover design is a thing of beauty , and an ornamented slide-case pro- tects the book from injury .

		The same expert illustrator of Thoreau who last year gave us an unequaled edition of '' Walden '' Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	has this year bestowed his sympathetic attention on that almost equally fasci - nating record of the roaming naturalist-poet , '' A Week on the
Concord	LOCATION	and
Merrimack Rivers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In - dependent to the point of wilfulness in his goings and comings ,
Thoreau	PERSON	once replied to a friend 's invitation to visit him : '' Such are my engagements to myself that I dare not promise to wend your way . ''

		In wending his own way he is always a picturesque figure in the landscape and an object of unfailing curiosity and interest .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	devotes the opening pages of his volume to a brief mention of some of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's more marked char - acteristics as a man , and he provides the succeeding chapters from the naturalist 's pen with admirable and appropriate camera views along the route of his wanderings .

		No fancy pictures could so well have enabled the reader to follow the tourist in imagina - tion from day to day throughout that memorable `` week . ''

		The clear open type of the book is a joy to failing eyes , and the artistic cover design a pleas - ure to eyes of every degree of strength .

		The book is well boxed , and is published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fanciful , the grotesque , the gruesome , the beautiful , and the comic enter into the composition of Mr.
H. G. Theaker	PERSON	's sixteen colored illustrations to '' The Ingoldsby Legends , '' once more issued by the Macmillans as an unfailingly popular holiday book for children of all ages .

		It is seventy-one years this
winter	DATE	since the Rev.
Richard Harris Barham	PERSON	complied with
Bentley	PERSON	's request to collect into a volume sundry tales and jingles , some of which had appeared in ''
Bentley	PERSON	's Miscellany , '' The fertile invention and facile pen of ''
Thomas Ingoldsby	PERSON	, '' as the author chose to style himself , caused the book to run through its first edition and into a second in
1843	DATE	; and since then it has undergone nobody knows how many reprintings .

		The artist of the present edition has allowed his frolic fancy as free scope with the pencil and brush as did the blythe Mr.
Barham	PERSON	with the pen .

		The fables attributed to ^
Esop	ORGANIZATION	will retain their popularity as long as the poems attributed to Homer , and will probably be much oftener read by the mul - titude .

		A new edition of '' ^
Esop	ORGANIZATION	's Fables '' comes to us from the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, beautifully printed at the De
Vinne Press	ORGANIZATION	, and illustrated by Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	in line drawings that very effectively and often humorously tell the story to which each is attached .

		Full-page plates with ornamental bor - ders and smaller cuts in the printed page intensify the interest of the Fables and help to make them as applicable to the present as they were to the times of the mythical fabulist .

		A delicately tinted border encloses each page of reading matter .

		A more

		THE DIAL 479 attractive presentation of these immortal apologues could not be desired .

		Colored pictures of pleasing design , and , while bright and cheerful , reproducing the neutral tints so predominant in our every-day life , adorn the several volumes of the '' Burlington Library '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which includes , thus far , ``
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' '' The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' '' The Essays of Elia , '' '' A Tale of Two Cities , '' and '' The Imitation of Christ . ''

		The old-fashioned charm of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's ever-delightful story is well matched by the grace and the atmosphere of rural quiet and happiness in Miss
Evelyn Paul	PERSON	's dainty illustrations .

		But it is unnecessary to commend each volume of the set separately , the other illustrators of which are Miss
Margaret Jameson	PERSON	,
Miss Sybil Tawse	PERSON	, and Mr. Sep. .


E. Scott	PERSON	, while the '' Imitation '' is embellished with reproductions from the old masters .

		Each book has a paper wrapper with a colored picture , and each is boxed separately and sold separately .

		`` The Virginian , '' Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's most popu - lar book , celebrates its decennial anniversary by ap - pearing in a new specially illustrated edition .

		To the pictures by Mr.
Charles M. Russell	PERSON	, which depict to the eye scenes and characters so adroitly delineated by the pen , are added a number of the late
Frederic Remington	PERSON	's masterly drawings of cow-boy horse - manship and that life of the plains that will soon become ancient history .


Cheyenne	LOCATION	still stands in the very heart of the region chosen by Mr.
Wister	PERSON	as the scene of his realistic narrative of life in cattle - land ; but the picturesque figures he has made live and move before our eyes have vanished forever .

		Lin
McLean	ORGANIZATION	and
Scipio le Moyne	ORGANIZATION	and Trampas and the nameless '' Virginian '' live henceforth only in the novelist 's pages ; and they have taken a new lease of life in this latest edition -LRB- with its added illustra - tions and colored frontispiece -RRB- of '' The Virginian : A Horseman of the Plains '' -LRB-

Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	in uniform style with their last year 's edition of ''
Pippa Passes	PERSON	, and Men and Women , '' and , like that , beautifully illustrated in color by
Miss E. Fortesque Brickdale	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text of the poems is that of their first publication , with some exceptions referred to in a '' Publishers ' Note . '' ''

		Saul '' is omitted , as it was included in the above - mentioned companion volume .

		The book is an ad - mirable pocket-volume , leather-bound and free from stiffness .

		The ten illustrations catch the spirit of the poems , and exhibit skill and taste .

		Tennyson 's `` In Memoriam `` and `` The Princess , '' in type that is bold but not too bold , and provided with eight graceful pictures in tint by Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	, are published by the Putnams in two volumes a volume to each of the poems sold separately .

		Introductory matter has been selected from Mr.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	's '' Ten - nyson : His Art and Relation to Modern Life , '' and Mrs.
Elisabeth Luther Gary	PERSON	's '' Tennyson : His Homes , his Friends , and his Work . ''

		The volumes are of pleasing design , but faulty in their unwil - lingness to open easily and lie open .

		However , we have met many worse offenders in this respect .

		No Christmas season would be complete without its specially illustrated edition , or editions , of
Dick	PERSON	- ens 's ''
Christmas Carol	PERSON	. ''

		And on this , the eve of its author 's centenary , a revival of the ever-popular tale is most timely .

		A handsome reprinting of the little classic , on heavy paper , with wide margins and a baker 's dozen of colored illustrations , comes from the
Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Miss Ethel F. Everett	PERSON	being the artist in this instance , and her pictures having a rather unusual character .

		The fantastic rather than the realistic is their note .

		The cover , with its represent - ation of Tiny Tim on the front , is peculiar as well as artistic .

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS . ''

		Turner has some golden visions , glorious and beautiful .

		They are only visions , but still , they are art , and one could live and die with such pictures . ''

		So said the visionary 's fellow artist ,
John Constable	PERSON	, as quoted by Mr.
C. Lewis	PERSON	Hind in his sumptuous quarto , `` Turner 's Golden Visions '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , which reproduces in color fifty of the master 's paintings .

		In sixty short chapters the author gives the story of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's life and the development of his art .

		It ap - pears that
Ruskin	PERSON	's idol has been also the object of Mr.
Hind	PERSON	's ardent admiration from boyhood up , and so his book proves to be something far other than a mere compilation or piece of perfunctory hack-work .

		Understanding and sympathy speak in its pages , and though he quotes freely from other art critics he is never at a loss for a telling word with which to char - acterize the various canvases and water-colors of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's that he takes occasion to discuss .

		The Turner exhibition of
1906	DATE	contributed no little to - ward an adequate appreciation of that artist 's work , such as the present volume contains .

		Mr.
Hind	PERSON	writes : ''
Ruskin	PERSON	really did a great service to
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps even greater than the publication of Modern Painters , when he rolled up the ' unfinished ' oils and water-colours and deposited them in the cellars of the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our new joy in
Turner	LOCATION	, the rush of admiration and veneration that came when those golden visions were exhibited in
1906	DATE	, could never have been had not they been protected from the light for so many years : then , suddenly , to reveal their splendor . ''

		Turner 's works in general have lost some part of their first brightness of tint , as this unrolling of the
Ruskin	PERSON	collection proved .

		The fifty colored plates in the book , chiefly of paintings in the
Tate	LOCATION	and
National	ORGANIZATION	galleries , are splendid examples of such illustration , and not lacking in
Turner	LOCATION	character - istics .

		Little more than a year has passed since the death of
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	, but it has sufficed for the prepar - ation of a masterly study of the great artist and his work from the scholarly pen of Mr.
William Howe Downes	PERSON	. ''

		The Life and Work of Winslow Homer , '' published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a book of generous dimensions , as it had need to be for the 480 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, adequate portrayal of one whose services to Amer - ican art are not to be briefly or hurriedly estimated .

		One is impressed , in reading about Homer and in scanning his pictures , even in greatly reduced reproduction , with the fidelity of his brush to the thing painted ; also with his mastery of the sea as a fertile subject for his art .

		Of the abundant fruit of his industry the book reproduces , in black and white , many examples , besides giving various portraits and views that appropriately belong to such a biography .

		Appended lists of Homer 's paintings , both in oil and water-color , are provided , with an attempt at chronological arrangement , and biblio - graphy and index follow .

		Mr.
Downes	PERSON	has given us what may well be considered the most important artist-biography of the season .

		The
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Welsh artist , Mr.
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	, has already , in the first forty-three years of his life , accomplished so much that is of high excellence as to justify a detailed study of his work , fully illus - trated in both color-plates and half-tone reproduc - tions , from the hand of Mr.
Walter Shaw-Sparrow	PERSON	. ''

		Frank
Brangwyn	PERSON	and his Work '' -LRB-
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a handsome volume of quarto size , giving in considerable detail an appreciative survey of the artist 's varied handiwork as painter , etcher , deco - rator , designer of household furniture and of stained glass , and , in short , as master of brush and pencil or other implement of his craft in the production of things beautiful , for Mr.
Brangwyn	PERSON	appears to be as many-sided as any of the great masters of mediaeval times .

		His wandering and eventful life , too , is sketched by Mr.
Shaw-Sparrow	PERSON	, making the book an interesting narrative apart from its special appeal to art-lovers .

		Classified lists of Mr.
Brangwyn	PERSON	's paint - ings , sketches , and etchings are appended , as is also a bibliography of writings by and about him ; and an index completes the volume .

		The difficulty of reproducing on the page of a book any large painting is felt by both author and reader ; but at least these plates convey a hint of that in the artist 's work which has been called by a French critic `` a something intensely vivid , a something glowing and irradiating that delights the eye . ''

		Architecture , so far above the merely imitative arts in the esteem of many Sir
Francis Palgrave	PERSON	among them as to merit the rank of queen , can - not complain of any lack of reverence paid to her in Mr.
T. Francis Bumpus	PERSON	's octavo volume , `` The Cathedrals of
Central Italy	LOCATION	, '' issued in this country by
Messrs James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first chapter , cov - ering seventy-eight pages , traces the author 's itiner - ary from
Paris	LOCATION	to
Genoa	LOCATION	, and thence , through
Pisa	LOCATION	,
Siena	LOCATION	,
Orvieto	LOCATION	,
Viterbo	LOCATION	,
Toscanella	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Narni	LOCATION	,
Spoleto	LOCATION	,
Assisi	LOCATION	,
Perugia	LOCATION	,
Cortona	LOCATION	,
Arezzo	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	,
Prato	LOCATION	,
Pistoja	LOCATION	, and
Lucca	LOCATION	, back into
France	LOCATION	.

		Brief description of the famous cathedrals visited is sup - plemented with numerous illustrations .

		More de - tailed studies follow in the remaining six chapters , which treat of Romanesque architecture as illus - trated by certain of the cathedrals visited , of Gothic architecture as exemplified in certain others , and of the subsidiary arts of sculpture and painting and glass - staining .

		Fifty-one illustrations , four of them in color from paintings by Mr.
Stafford Leake	PERSON	, adorn the book and help to make clear the author 's descrip - tions and comments ; and a map showing the route he followed is also added .

		With its many excel - lent features the book is one to delight the student of cathedral architecture as well as the
Italy	LOCATION	- seeking traveller . ''

		Art in
France	LOCATION	, '' by
Louis Hourticq	PERSON	, is the lat - est volume in the '' Ars Una '' series , published in
America	LOCATION	by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mon - sieur
Hourticq	PERSON	, who is Inspector of Fine Arts for the city of
Paris	LOCATION	, gives us for the first time a history of French art treated as a whole ; he divides his sub - ject into periods , and takes up architecture , sculpture , painting , and the lesser representative arts , in their development and inter-relation through the centuries from their origin down to the present day .

		The book is a multum in parvo of compact scholarship ; it is surprising how much of really essential detail is packed into its less than five hundred pages .

		Yet facts are so linked by comparison , and the whole treatment so clarified by general ideas , that the nar - rative holds the interest well ; it reveals its Gallic origin by its lightness and grace .

		The English trans - lation is fairly satisfactory ; gallicisms and misprints are happily rare .

		The illustrations , numbering nearly a thousand , including four full-page plates in color , are a history of art in themselves , and make one wish that the work could also be published in a library quarto .

		Small as they are , however , they are clear and well printed ; one only regrets the ne - cessity of the heavy clay-sized paper .

		Type and presswork are excellent , and the book is strongly and flexibly bound .

		Full bibliographies complete its usefulness for the student , and an index enables the tourist to use the manual -LRB- which will go readily into his coat pocket -RRB- as a companion to his guide - book , coordinating his impressions and his knowledge as he travels through
France	LOCATION	.

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		Gardens become almost things of life and sense , in a human way , as seen and studied in Miss
Hildegarde Hawthorne	PERSON	's strikingly beautiful vol - ume , '' The Lure of the Garden , '' which the Cen - tury
Co.	ORGANIZATION	issues with half a hundred illustrations , many in color , by Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	, Mr.
Jules Gue	PERSON	`` rin , Mr.
Sigismond de Ivanowski	PERSON	, and other artists .

		That the granddaughter of the author of '' Mosses from an Old Manse '' should write with sympathy and enthusiasm about old gardens , the habits of flowers , the literature of gardens , the social side of gardens , and gardens and gossips , is not surprising .

		Every gardener of experience will read with appreciation the chapter on '' Some Gar - den Vices , '' a chapter that includes also some vices of the garden 's neighbors .

		Apt selections from the poets of gardening are interspersed .

		The pic - tures , varying in style and degree of idealism or realism , according to the artist , are all that could
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 481 be desired as accompaniment to the reading matter .

		The fragrance of
summer	DATE	is in the book , and also just a taste of the tonic of winter in a short chapter entitled `` Winter Wonder . ''

		The volume is appro - priately bound and boxed .

		The pleasures of gardening are partly anticipa - tory ; and so in the winter one can read garden books and seed catalogues , and thus possess his soul in patience until
spring	DATE	opens and planting begins .

		One of the latest and most alluring of these literary substitutes for the real thing is Miss
Lena May McCauley	PERSON	's eye-delighting volume , '' The Joy of Gardens '' -LRB- Rand-McNally -RRB- , which is profusely illus - trated , both in color and in black and white .

		The camera has been effectively used in securing views of many famous gardens , both in this country and in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Miss
McCauley	PERSON	takes her readers through the year , dwelling on the horticultural joys belonging to each month .

		In her chapter on '' The Delights of Faith '' occurs the following cryptic utter - ance : '' A corner in the library devoted to books of magic may be counted among the things needful to get in tune with gardens . ''

		And here is a warning : '' More gardens have been ruined by careless sprink - lers than by a dry spell . ''

		There is instruction and suggestion as well as recreation in Miss
McCauley	PERSON	's well-considered chapters .

		Two collections of real love affairs , told from supposedly trustworthy records , greet this year the seeker after something a little more substantial than fiction and a little less solid than history .

		Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	presents in very readable and attractive form '' The Loves of the Poets '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , comprising the
Brownings	PERSON	' perhaps already too publicly known love story , the affair between
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	and
George Sand	PERSON	,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's and
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	's impassioned friendship , the attachment that led to the marriage of
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Siddal	PERSON	,
Mary Stuart	PERSON	's minor love affair with the unheroic
Pierre Chastelard	PERSON	, and some leg - endary attachments of sundry early poets , with con - cluding remarks on the relative charms of dark and fair ladies .

		Portraits , ornamental page-borders , cream-tinted paper , and excellent type combine to render `` The Loves of the Poets '' a book not easily to be passed by . ''

		Great Love Stories of the Theatre '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Charles W. Collins	PERSON	, is a much larger work , with fuller quotation from more or less authentic sources .

		From the early days of the Restoration down to the beginning of the Victorian reign we have a number of famous love affairs , chiefly of an unedifying or even disastrous issue , such as that between
Nell Gwyn	PERSON	and
Charles II.	PERSON	; or that between
Maurice de Saxe	PERSON	and the pretty soubrette ,
Justine Favart	PERSON	; or
Adrienne Lecouvreur	PERSON	's too faith - ful devotion to the same unscrupulous
Maurice	PERSON	; or the follies of '' Becky '' Wells ; or
Dora Jordan	PERSON	's ill-requited devotion to the
Duke of Clarence	ORGANIZATION	.

		These and other stories , to the number of twelve , are well and , so far as may be , authoritatively told , with accompanying portraits of eight of the chief characters .

		`` Scottish Life and Character , in Anecdote and Story '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.
William Harvey	PERSON	, and illustrated in color by Mr.
Erskine Nicol	PERSON	and others , contains a greater number and variety of amusing anecdotes than any book of its kind we have seen , though the supply of such
Scot	PERSON	- tish jest-books , beginning with the unexcelled '' Rem - iniscences '' of
Dean Ramsay	PERSON	, is far from scanty .

		Under such alluring chapter-headings as '' Gown and Bands , '' '' Desk and Tuning Fork , '' '' Plate and Ladle , '' `` The
Bailie	PERSON	, '' `` The Doctor , '' and `` The Bairns , '' are grouped stories innumerable , not all of them irresistibly funny , but all having the true
Scot	PERSON	- tish flavor , and enjoyable in the reading if not taken in too liberal doses .

		Their sources , whether real life or books , are not indicated ; nor does it much matter so long as staleness is avoided .

		The cheerful - hued pictures , sixteen in number , speak of
Scotland	LOCATION	in every line , though bearing only a general relation to the accompanying text .

		Two pleasing little volumes of poetic and artis - tic charm are issued by
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' A Flower Anthology , '' selected and illustrated by Mr.
Alfred Rawlings	PERSON	, contains favorite passages from the earlier and the Victorian poets , interspersed with re - productions of water-color drawings , each presenting in its native habitat the flower or flowers sung by the poet on an adjacent page .

		It is not the too familiar flower-painting of the amateur that Mr.
Rawlings	PERSON	gives us , but bits of rural beauty to which the wood anemone , the snowdrop , the primrose and the peri - winkle , and others , contribute their modest charm .

		The difficulties of colored illustration have not been entirely overcome , but they have been very credit - ably contended against . ''

		The Scholar Gypsy '' and '' Thyrsis , '' by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, with ten colored pictures -LRB- reproductions , by the four-color process , of water-colors from the brush of Mr.
W. Russell Flint	PERSON	-RRB- , make up the other book referred to .

		The de - signs are appropriate , and their execution all that could be expected .

		Each volume is clearly printed on the best of paper , and bound in limp cloth , or , if one prefers , in velvet calf .

		Miss
Helen Archibald Clarke	PERSON	has chosen for her this year 's volume of literary anecdote and disquisi - tion , with appropriate accompaniment of photo-en - graving , a promising theme , '' The Poet 's New En - gland . ''

		Nor does the title page arouse expectations that are not fulfilled .

		Five generous chapters dwell at length on the inspiration received by our
New England	LOCATION	poets from nature , from local history and legend , from current thought and sentiment , from their friendships , and from other sources that fed their genius and made their verse characteristic of their time and place .

		Miss
Clarke	PERSON	's method is some - what rambling , but for that reason the more inclusive .

		Her pages are filled with literary chat and frequent quotations , the latter being drawn with no sparing hand from the poets most familiar and dear to every lover of what is best in American literature .

		The numerous illustrations include a colored frontispiece and tinted views and portraits of much interest .

		The 482 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	,
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued the book in hand - some form , beautifully printed , bound , and boxed .

		The
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	series of English dictionaries , based in part on the lexicographical labors of
Noah Webster	PERSON	, and bearing his name on the title page , have the merit of serviceability and inexpensiveness .

		The latest addition to this series is ''
Webster	PERSON	's New Standard American Dictionary of the English Lan - guage , '' with '' encyclopedic features , '' twenty-three full-page plates , and two thousand text illustrations , compiled and edited by Mr.
E. T. Roe	PERSON	, and printed on excellent paper , in bold , clear type .

		The binding is flexible , the back strong and at the same time lim - ber .

		Portraits illustrating various nationalities meet the eye ; under `` Japanese , `` for instance , is given a small picture of Prince
Ito	PERSON	, with brief description and dates of birth and death .

		Further on , the word '' sil - houette '' is both derived from the niggardly French minister of finance of that name and illustrated by a good profile likeness in black of
Benjamin Franklin	LOCATION	.

		Synonyms and antonyms are occasionally given .

		Among the synonyms of balloon we find '' aeroplane , '' and as an antonym '' parachute '' which is open to criticism .

		For handiness , inexpen - siveness , and compactness , this dictionary is excel - lent .

		Of course the
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	so-called
Webster	PERSON	's dictionaries are not to be confused with the famous
Webster	PERSON	dictionaries published by the Merriams of
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, ever since our grandfathers were schoolboys .

		Mr.
Frank Finn	PERSON	's generously illustrated book , `` The Wild Beasts of the World '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- has pages of so ample dimensions as to make possible the drawing of animal figures and jungle scenes on a sufficiently large scale for realistic effect .

		One hun - dred colored illustrations by Mr.
Louis Sargent	PERSON	, and other artists accompany the descriptive matter , which embraces about four hundred of the chief untamed mammals of the world .

		These pictures are in vivid hues and of striking appearance , sure to attract young naturalists and , indeed , all young folk of nor - mal curiosity and with a passion for the animate wonders of forest and plain .

		The descriptive mat - ter is brief and general enough not to weary the unscientific person , and is printed in type of an in - viting largeness and clearness .

		The book is a con - tribution to the popular nature-study whose devo - tees are daily increasing in number .

		In a new series appropriately named '' The Watteau Library '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- appear three exquisite specimens of artistic book-making , to be followed by others .

		`` Five Types , '' by Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, includes his essays on `` The Optimism of Byron , '' `` Pope and the Art of Satire , '' ``
Stevenson	PERSON	, '' `` Rostand , '' and `` Charles II . ''

		In a selection from
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's works are comprised `` The Inner Beauty , '' which gives its name to the little book , `` Silence , '' and `` The Invisible Goodness . ''

		The third number , entitled '' Gardens and Friend - ship , '' contains eight of
Bacon	LOCATION	's essays , including those designated on the cover .

		Handmade paper , excellent print , photogravure head-pieces and tail - pieces vellum wrappers , separate slide-cases for each volume such are the more visible and material attractions of the series .

		Feminine grace and charm and piquancy are portrayed in divers aspects and attitudes by Mr.
C. Coles Phillips	PERSON	in his collection of colored draw - ings entitled `` A Gallery of Girls , '' and published in quarto form by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many of the plates have appeared on the covers of late numbers of '' Life , '' to the admiration of all beholders , while others have won favor elsewhere .

		There are forty of these full-page studies of feminine beauty , some of them with the now familiar peculiarity of a flat background undistinguishable from the girl 's dress , thus leaving the imagination considerable freedom of play in tracing the lines of the figure .

		Ingenuity and cleverness are revealed in the legends at the bot - tom of the plates '' Arms and the Man , '' '' Such Stuff as Dreams Are Made On , '' '' Long Distance Lends Enchantment , '' `` Survival of the Fittest , '' etc. .

		The left-hand pages of the book have smaller but equally good drawings in black and white .

		Love , '' the despair of philosophers and sages , the rapture of poets , the confusion of cynics , and the warrior 's defeat , '' forms the subject of the extracts , chiefly in verse , collected and arranged by Miss
Jennie Day Haines	PERSON	, and published under the title , `` The Book of Love , '' by
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From Shakespeare and
John Lyly	PERSON	to
Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	and Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, the selections cover a range to suit all tastes .

		Cupids in various airy attitudes adorn the margins , and a pretty face encircled by cu - pids forms the frontispiece .

		Love of a different sort , maternal affection this time , serves as the theme of a companion volume from the same publishing house .

		`` Mother Love : A Book of the Heart '' is compiled by
Miss Ina Russell Warren	PERSON	, and f urn ished with deco - rations by Miss
Jane Allen Boyer	PERSON	.

		Blank pages for recording `` events in baby 's life '' follow the selec - tions .

		Taste and skill have combined in the mak - ing of these two coloi ' - books , each of which has an ornamental binding and a decorated box .

		The present growing interest in Celtic lore , es - pecially in such remnants of Celtic manners and cus - toms and speech and legend as are to be found in
Ireland	LOCATION	and in the highlands of
Scotland	LOCATION	, gives time - liness to Mr.
T. W. Rolleston	PERSON	's '' Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , copiously illustrated by Mr.
Stephen Reid	PERSON	and others .

		The author holds that the term '' Anglo-Saxon '' as applied to the great mass of English and Americans is incorrect and misleading .

		We are Anglo-Celts even more than we are Anglo-Saxons ; for do not the statistics of relative '' nigresence '' prove it ?

		At any rate , whether one 's blood be nine-tenths Celtic and one - tenth something else , or the reverse , or even wholly without Celtic admixture , one can not turn Mr.
Rolleston	PERSON	's pages without admiring the evidences of research and literary skill there displayed .

		The Celtic legends are presented in a form inviting to readers , with a sufficiency of historical and anti- quarian commentary .

		The bibliography of the sub -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 483 ject is not entered into , but a full glossary and index -LRB- combined -RRB- , with a brief but welcome guide to pronunciation , follow the reading matter .

		The pictures take the form of full-page plates , and the binding of the book is of elaborate and pleasing design .

		The inimitable
Peter Pan	PERSON	, after delighting the theatre-going public , now reappears , with many new tricks and drolleries and prodigious exploits , to amuse the larger world of book-readers of all de - grees of youthfulness , from six to sixty , or beyond . ''


Peter	PERSON	and Wendy '' is the title of Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's new book , which is fitly illustrated with graceful draw - ings by Mr.
F. D. Bedford	PERSON	, while large print , paper of fine quality , and ornamental binding unite to give a festive aspect to this excellent holiday diversion .

		Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	has a much freer hand and more spacious scene in ''
Peter	PERSON	and Wendy '' than in the play of ''
Peter Pan	PERSON	. ''

		The plot , if one may so call the string of diverting phantasies that fill the book , is more fully elaborated , and the ending is more satis - factory .

		In short ,
Neverland	ORGANIZATION	is made as real and as irresistibly inviting as heart of child could desire .

Charles Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's Sons . -RRB-

		Since man never is , but always to be , blest , the secret of happiness has a perennial fascination for him ; and once more the interpretation of the mys - tery is attempted , this time by the Rev.
Hugh Black	PERSON	in his attractive volume -LRB- uniform with others in the same author 's series -RRB- entitled `` Happiness '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Before writing on '' The Secret of Happiness '' and '' The Art of Happiness , '' he discourses on '' The Right to Happiness , '' '' The Duty of Happiness , '' and '' The Sources of Happiness , '' while the book con - cludes with remarks on the grades of , the shadow on , the foes of , and the heart of , happiness .

		Happiness in most of its aspects is thus presented to view by one whose writings never lack in suggestiveness and moral uplift .

		A delicately tinted scroll-border sets off each page , the binding is in blue and gilt , and a box protects the volume from injury .

		The mosaic pattern of Mr.
Wayne Whipple	PERSON	's two - volume '' Story - Life of
Washington	LOCATION	, '' which is fur - ther described as '' a life-history in five hundred true stories , selected from original sources and fitted to - gether in order , with reproductions of paintings , en - gravings , and manuscripts , '' gives it a rather novel interest as well as an unusual appearance .

		We have a composite photograph , or , more accurately , a com - posite moving-picture , relieved of the pronounced distortions of any single portrait , and emphasizing the best features common to them all .

		The authori - ties quoted are innumerable , and of varied charac - ter .

		A passage from Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	's '' In the Shadow of the Lord '' stands next to one from
Washington	LOCATION	's '' Journal , '' and that next to an extract from
Washington Irving	LOCATION	.

		With praiseworthy care the source of each selection is accurately given at its end .

		The same compiler 's '' Story-Life of Lincoln '' has already broken the way for and perfected the method of this other '' story-life . ''

		The numerous illustrations from many sources comprise both por - traits and imaginative compositions .

		Excellent print and binding are features in the mechanical equip - ment of the work , which is issued by the
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		I would credit a man with a great many other virtues if he surprised me with an apt quotation from
Horace	PERSON	in reply to my question as to the state of the market or the condition of crops . ''

		There speaks the lover of old authors , in his preface to a handy volume that further attests his passion .

		`` The Friendship of Books , '' edited by Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	, draws upon the standard authors who have ex - pressed themselves in praise of reading , but searches out many passages unfamiliar to most of us , and also lays under contribution a number of later authors , such as Mr.
Gerald Stanley Lee	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and Mr.
Charles Ferguson	PERSON	.

		Drawings , of quaint and pleasing design , are contributed by Mr.
Harold Nelson	PERSON	, and nothing is lacking to render the book 's exterior worthy of its well-chosen contents .

		Four of the late
Ottilie A. Liljencrantz	PERSON	's Norse tales , `` A Viking 's Love , '' '' The Hostage , '' `` As the Norns Weave , '' and `` How Thor Recovered his Ham - mer , '' are gathered into a volume and published un - der the title `` A
Viking	ORGANIZATION	's Love , and Other Tales of the North , '' by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The untimely death , little more than a year ago , of the gifted writer of these stories receives appropriate mention in a preliminary note on her education and her literary tastes and achievements .

		Known as the author of '' The Thrall of Leif the Lucky '' and '' The Ward of
King Canute	PERSON	, '' Miss Liljencrantz will be read with pleasure in her less elaborate essays in fiction .

		Her portrait at the head of the sketch above referred to , a frontispiece illustration to one of the tales , and a pale blue decorative border to the pages , constitute the chief ornamental features of the book .

		The binding is also ornamented , and the book is appropriately boxed .

		It is a capital gift book for story-readers .

		Friendship has moved the poet to sing far less often than love ; but that it has thus moved him becomes amply evident in Mr.
John R. Howard	PERSON	's anthology entitled '' Poems of Friendship , '' which the
Crowell Company	ORGANIZATION	issues in beautiful form with an appropriate frontispiece of Mr.
C. F. Neagle	PERSON	's drawing and other artistic embellishments .

		Industry and taste have been used by Mr.
Howard	PERSON	in making up his three hundred pages of excellent selections .

		Introduction and indexes are supplied .

		From the same house , and in the same style , comes another book of selected poems , but on a more general and inclusive theme . ''

		On Life 's Highway '' is the title , and the volume is further described as '' a book for graduates who have received their equipment and are to begin their journey . ''

		But it is a book for all readers who hold with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	that poetry is the criticism of life .

		A novel idea is illustrated in '' Our New Home : How We Plan to Build It '' -LRB-
Reilly & Britton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with drawings in color by Miss
Louise Perrett	PERSON	, and 484 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, many interspersed blank pages for pen or pencil ex - ercise on the part of the reader . ''

		Reader , '' how - ever , is the wrong word here , for the book is to be written by its purchaser , being , as announced on the title-page , '' a book for sketches , ideas , and sugges - tions . ''

		Every young couple and some older ones hope one day to build a home , and this scrap-book plan will help them to do it to their satisfaction .

		The illustrations are pleasing bits of interior and exterior domesticity , suggestive and helpful , while page - headings are further provided to ensure system and method in the ordering of original or selected mat - ter .

		The binding is strong , and in all respects the volume serves both use and beauty .

		One of the most appropriate gift-books of the sea - son is '' The Christmas City : Bethlehem across the Ages '' -LRB-

Lewis Gaston Leary	PERSON	, an orientalist of long residence and extended travels in the
East	LOCATION	, having first-hand acquaintance with the people and the customs of the Holy Land , and master of a vivid and graceful style of narra - tion .

		The
Bethlehem	LOCATION	of
Jacob	PERSON	's time , the
Bethlehem	LOCATION	of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Bethlehem	LOCATION	of later days , are recalled by appropriate bits of incident and description .

		The suggestive chapter headings , such as `` The Grave by the Roadside , '' `` The Girl from beyond
Jordan	PERSON	, '' `` The Boy who was to be King , '' `` The Night of Nights , '' and `` The Story of the Stable , '' epitomize the book 's contents , while well - chosen illustrations , from famous paintings and from photographs , further emphasize the meaning and purpose of the book .

		The frontispiece reproduces in color l -LRB- The Holy Night '' of Zenisek on a very small scale , it is true .

		The local views are perhaps more satisfactory .

		The cover design is apt as well as artistic , and the print and paper are excellent .

		The mythology of astronomy is entertainingly treated by Mr.
William Tyler Olcott	PERSON	in his `` Star Lore of All Ages '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which forms a fitting sequel to the same author 's `` Field Book of the Stars '' and '' In Starland with a Three-inch
Tele	ORGANIZATION	- scope . ''

		Diagrams of the chief constellations are given , with outline drawings of the mythological figures they are supposed to represent ; and further illustrative material has been drawn from famous paintings and works of sculpture , such as
Watts	LOCATION	's
Ganymede	LOCATION	, the Farnese Hercules ,
Veronese	PERSON	's `` Rape of Europa , '' and so on .

		Both classic and oriental mythology are made to contribute to the book 's ful - ness of information , and considerable attention is given to the philology of the subject .

		A volume of four hundred and fifty closely-printed pages is thus placed at the disposal of the myth-loving student of astronomy .

		In its wealth of illustration and its ornate binding the book presents an appearance in harmony with the season .

		The novelization of dramas seems trying , in these latter days , to keep pace with the dramatization of novels . ''

		Pomander Walk '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Mr.
Louis N. Parker	PERSON	, takes its place beside Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's ``
Peter	PERSON	and Wendy '' as a highly successful narrative elabo - ration of a pleasing and popular play .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	is of course able to work out his fourfold love-story , with all its amusing and eccentric characters , in much greater detail in the story than in the play .

		The inimitable Sir
Peter Antrobus	PERSON	, with his ejacula - tory '' Gobblesmysoul , '' the sweetly captivating
Marjolaine	ORGANIZATION	, the resolute Mrs.
Poskett	PERSON	with her mat - rimonial designs upon Sir
Peter	PERSON	, the hunchback violinist and the love-lorn
Barbara Pennymint	PERSON	, the conquering
Jack Sayle	PERSON	, the Reverend Doctor
Jacob Sternroyd	PERSON	, and the rest of the highly diverting den - izens of Pomander Walk , all are made to walk and talk and gossip and make love , or watch others make love , in a very human and irresistible fashion .

		The illustrator , furthermore , has caught the spirit of the story and has interpreted its characters in a most satisfactory manner .

		A colored frontispiece and a pictured cover , with other decorative features , pro- claim this a book for the festive season .

		Professor
Percival Lowell	PERSON	's '' Soul of the Far East , '' written and first published before its astron - omer-author had become more interested in the Martians than in the Terrestrials -LRB- whether Oriental or
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will not soon lose its charm of mingled humor , acuteness of observation , grace of style , and warm human interest .

		Its fine qualities fully justify the issue of a new edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with thirty-two illustrations , six of which are repro - ductions of hitherto unpublished prints in the col - lection of the late John La Farge , while others are from Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	's ``
Japan	LOCATION	and the Japanese , '' still others from Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	's '' A Diplomat 's Wife in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and the remainder from photographs taken by the author .

		Mr.
Burges Johnson	PERSON	's rollicking rhymes wed themselves well to his merry conceits .

		A collection of these oddities in verse is published under the title '' Bashful Ballads '' by the Harpers .

		Why bashful ?

		it may be asked .

		For answer see the learned poet 's derivation of the word in his scholarly preface .

		In his '' Flight of the Clamoplane '' the reader will learn to whom first honors in aviation are really due .

		Notwithstanding the hard hit at book-reviewers in '' Taste for Literature , '' no discerning and honest member of the guild can withhold his commenda - tion from these amusing ballads .

		Four pictures of a humorous character are provided , while colored drawings adorn the outside and inside of the cover . ''

		Eve 's place among the women of the
Bible	LOCATION	is second to no other , '' is the indisputable assertion of the Rev.
John White Chadwick	PERSON	in his excellent chapter on our first ancestress in that well-conceived and well-written volume , '' Women of the Bible , '' which the Harpers bring out this year in a new edition with illustrations by Mr.
Frank V. Dumond	PERSON	.

		Twelve biblical female characters are treated each by an eminent authority , and each is also ideally presented in portraiture by Mr.
Dumond	PERSON	, while Mr.
J. G. Kitchell	PERSON	's '' Composite Madonna '' is added as frontispiece .

		The chapters are brief and the typog - raphy is clear and open .

		NOTES .

		The
Cambridge Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	is to have a Com - memoration of the late Colonel
Thomas Wentworth	PERSON	Hig - ginagn , at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, on
December 21	DATE	.

		The '' Biographical Edition '' of the works of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, published by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, has been enriched by the addition of a short life of the author .

		It is an abridgment , in one volume , of the original two - volume work by
Graham Balfour	PERSON	.

		The
December	DATE	number of `` The English Review '' will contain the first of a series of essays by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	entitled '' Among my Books '' -LRB- written in his eighty-first year -RRB- , and also an article on '' American Characteristics , '' by Mr.
Filson Young	PERSON	.

		An interesting book to Americans will be '' The Pan - ama Canal : A Study in International Law and Diplo - macy , '' by Dr.
Harmodio Arias	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	, LL.B. , sometime Exhibitioner and Prizeman of
St. John 's College	ORGANIZATION	, Cam - bridge .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	will publish the volume this month . ''

		The Autobiography of Sir
Henry Morton Stanley	PERSON	, '' a story of the career of the great African explorer as well as a remarkable revelation of his inner life , has now been reissued by
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a popular-priced edition , fully illustrated , and containing a folding map of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Frederick L. Hoffman	PERSON	, the well-known actuary and statistician , has rendered a great service to all per - sons interested in life insurance , through his book on `` Insurance Science andEconomics '' -LRB- TheSpectatorCo . -RRB-

		.

		Every policy-holder would do well to read his argument for federal supervision , and against extreme rates of taxation of premiums on policies .

		The erudition of the author is shown in his vast bibliography .

		We have been requested to publish the fact that at the
Simplified Spelling Conference	ORGANIZATION	held in
London	LOCATION
last September	DATE	three of the American delegates had been president of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	, and that the Conference was presided over by Dr.
Gilbert Mur	PERSON	- ray , Regius Professor of Greek at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such names of course carry weight , but think of all the distin - guished men on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	who are not in favor of Reformed Spelling !

		The second `` Library Bulletin '' issued by the
New York School of Philanthropy	ORGANIZATION	is a three-page selected list of books and articles on '' vocational guidance '' in the library of the school .

		General works are first enum - erated , and then works pertaining to different countries or to separate States of our own country .

		Only five of these States , with
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in the lead and
New York	LOCATION	a close second , are named as giving attention in
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 491 their public documents to this branch of education .

		The newness of the interest in the subject is attested by the dates of the publications listed , the last four years cov - ering nearly all the printed matter of importance .

		These bibliographical leaflets are free to applicants who should make known their wants to the librarian , Mr.
Frederick W. Jenkins	PERSON	, 105 E. 22d St. ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		Number two of volume nine of the '' University of Illinois Bulletin '' takes the form of a '' List of Serials '' in the library of that institution and in the public libra - ries of
Urbana	LOCATION	and
Champaign	LOCATION	, on the boundary line be - tween which two cities the university has its seat or more properly , just over the line from
Champaign	LOCATION	in the smaller town .

		Between eight and nine thousand titles find a place in this carefully-prepared catalogue , obvi - ously not the product of convict labor , but the handiwork -LRB- and brain-work -RRB- of Mr.
Francis W. Drury	PERSON	, assistant librarian of the university library , and other expert iu - dexers .

		The lack of such a list has long been felt at the university , and beside supplying that lack it is hoped it may facilitate and expedite the completion of many im - perfect sets .

		The practical working of the
California	LOCATION	county free library law , which has aroused the interest of librarians and others from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, was reported upon and discussed at the late annual convention of county librarians , held at the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Sacramento	LOCATION	, and well attended by those either now engaged in the work under discussion or preparing to enter upon it or at least interested in it .

		From the addresses and debates as epitomized in the current number of '' News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries '' it is clearly evident that a notable step forward has been taken on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , and that both those who read and those whose part it is to supply the reading matter are congratulating themselves upon the successful operation of the new law .

		To Mr.
J. L. Gillis	PERSON	,
State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	, high honor is paid for having first conceived the idea of a coordinated system that should bring any free library book in the
State	ORGANIZATION	within the reach of any resident .

		541 A UNIVERSITY INAUGURAL .

		The installation of a new president in one of our universities is getting to be an imposing function .

		It is attended by much pomp and circumstance , by a gathering of the clans and the guilds from near and far , by the presence of distinguished guests , and by many other forms of the parade that makes for publicity at least , although it does not always make for clearness of vision or sobriety of educational temper .

		We are not sure that we would advise a newly-elected university president , in imitation of the legend - ary story of
Jefferson	PERSON	's inauguration , to ride un - attended across the campus , hitch his horse to a post , mount an improvised platform , and speak his piece without further ceremony .

		But we are also by no means sure that the newer fashion is altogether commendable , or that its display of fuss and feathers is the surest way of impressing the public with a sense of the importance of the higher education .

		Education itself should not be made a spectacle , and the lavish employment of spectacular methods should be avoided in pre - senting its claims for public consideration .

		They will be found more likely to encourage the un - wholesome modern tendencies in educational work than to strengthen the nobler ideals that are our precious heritage from the past , and that we are in no little danger of forgetting .

		If we were to compare a dozen American inaugural addresses of the modern type with the same number selected from those of fifty years ago , we should not fail to notice many striking differences in spirit and declared pur - pose .

		The men themselves would be found so different that it would be easy enough to under - stand why the manner of their discourse should present so marked a contrast between the old and the new .

		The clerical and philosophical type of president that was almost universal in the days of our fathers has been replaced by a composite type of which the most prominent characteristics are those of the skilled adminis - trator , the successful man of affairs , the worker 516 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, in applied science , and sometimes , unfortu - nately , the time-serving politician .

		The change is not all for the better .

		It is apt to connote a suggestion of demogogic appeal , a readiness to make terms with the mammon of unrighteous - ness , a foolish emphasis upon '' efficiency '' in the commercial sense , a menace to the full freedom of intellectual activity , and , in general , a lapse from the standards of unworldliness that should make the university a Palladium of the soul , sending '' from its lone fastness high upon our life a ruling effluence , '' and warning us , when we most need such admonition , that material gain and the realization of vulgar ambition are not the real objects of life .

		A study of recent university inaugurals would reveal a considerable variety of styles .

		There is the breezy style , suggestive of the journalistic habit and the mental attitude of the man of the world .

		There is the heart-to-heart style , seem - ing to take the public into its full confidence .

		There is the optimistic style , persuaded that all is now for the best in education , and that the future will be even better than the present .

		There is the magniloquent style , swaying its hearers with florid rhetoric and vaguely entic - ing prospects .

		There is the statistical style , with its impressive array of facts and figures , taking for granted that numbers and endowments are about the only things that really matter in a university .

		And there is the style of ill con - cealed arrogance , expressing the personality of the man who frankly thinks of his colleagues as subordinates , and who will ride rough-shod over their rights as men and their freedom as edu - cators whenever his masterful instincts prompt him so to do .

		None of these styles , except the last , is to be utterly condemned , for each of them has its own peculiar effectiveness , but they all somehow miss the dignity , the high seriousness and the intellectual distinction of the old-time utterances upon inaugural occasions .

		We live in an age which holds the academic quality in flippant esteem , and its maintenance is difficult , even with the best of will , in the academic world .

		In refreshing contrast to many inaugurals of recent years , that of President
Vincent	PERSON	of the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	keeps ever in view the permanent ideals of education .

		These ideals have shifting manifestations , and they need from time to time to be re-voiced to accord with the mental habit of the new generation .

		If the tem - per and the spirit are kept firm , much latitude is permissible in the expressive form of the mes - sage .

		Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's message has both lightness of touch and reflective weight , and is adorned by the words of many of the wise who have lived before .

		Its keynotes are institutional solidarity based upon mutual consideration and cordial cooperation in a common cause , and social ser - vice based upon a broad understanding of the many new possibilities of usefulness that hardly came within the ken of the older university .

		He thinks of the institution as `` an instrument of the general purpose , a training place of social servants , a counsellor of the commonwealth , a source of knowledge and idealism . ''

		This shift - ing of the emphasis from individual culture to social usefulness is natural in a professional so - ciologist like Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	, and we can have no quarrel with it , because it means no change in the fundamental ideal of education .

		Individual culture has never been urged by its apostles -LRB- however mistakenly this may have been sup - posed -RRB- as the final cause of education .

		Such a contention would be as self-evidently futile as that of art for art 's sake .

		But it has been posited , all the way from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	to
Arnold	LOCATION	, as the necessary condition of general progress .

		Enrich your own life has been the precept , not for yourself alone , but that your example and your influence may enrich other lives as well .

		Those who have followed the first part of the precept , and ignored its corollary , have been recreant to the cause for which all the great apostles of culture have stood . ''

		If a people is not to perish mentally and spiritually , it must be steadily refreshed by streams of thought and idealism .

		Of these , the university strives to be a perennial source . ''

		Under the leadership of a man who thus sin - cerely conceives its function , the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	may well take heart anew .

		Its face is set toward a goal which , though far-off , is no marsh-fire illusion , but a steadfast beacon .

		It accepts
Newman	PERSON	's principle that the '' training of the intellect which is best for the individual himself , best enables him to discharge his duties to society . ''

		And its aim is no lower than is indicated in
Newman	LOCATION	's noble words : '' That perfection of the intellect , which is the result of education , and its beau ideal , to be imparted to indi - viduals in their respective measures , is the clear , calm , accurate vision and comprehension of all things , as far as the finite mind can embrace them , each in its place , and with its own characteristics upon it .

		It is almost prophetic from its knowledge of history , it is almost heart-searching from its knowledge of human nature , it has almost supernatural charity from its freedom from littleness and prejudice , it has almost the repose of faith , because nothing can startle it ; it has almost the beauty and harmony of heavenly contemplation , so in - timate is it with the eternal order of things and the music of the spheres . ''

		THE DIAJL 517 THE FIGHT FOR FREE RAW MATERIALS IN LITERATURE .

		The world is always pleading with Genius to be peaceful and proper . ''

		Do n't write those strong , strange , horrid things you delight in , '' it says .

		`` Do something pretty and pleasing , and I will take you on my lap and feed you with sugar-plums . '' ''

		But I must write masterpieces , '' answers the Genius . ''

		If you do I will knock you on the head ! ''

		screams the World . ''

		Knock and be hanged ! ''

		says the Genius .

		And so masterpieces come to be written , and so the Genius joins the '' Many proud ghosts of heroes who add to the train of Aides , Their bodies a booty to dogs or a prey to the ominous vultures . ''

		Generation after generation , year after year , the same storm of protest is evoked by any work which deals with the primal passions , the great crimes , the naked realities , or the evil-working potencies of life .

		But the strange thing is that what shocks one age is accepted with calm complacency by the next .

		Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	is only concerned with present violations of her code .


Paris	LOCATION	shuts its prudish ears to Moliere 's '' School for Wives , '' but in a few years it is read in the schools for students of literature . ''

		If I had been God , and known that ' The Robbers ' would be written , I should not have created the world , '' said a German prince , of
Schiller	PERSON	's play , which is now considered good for boys .

		The author of ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' was told that she was a woman who had forfeited the companionship of her sex ; but ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' is to-day a book for women .

		Even so dar - ing an innovator as
Rossetti	PERSON	said of '' Wuthering Heights '' that its scene was laid in hell , but apparently people in that locality bore English names .

		The best critical opinion to-day calls the work a tragic master - piece , the greatest book ever written by a woman .

		Not only time , but distance , seems to do away with the offence of force , the flavor of impropriety .

		Amer - ican audiences listen calmly to plays of German or Italian authors , when they would ostracize a native writer for similar work .

		Wherever power and beauty exist , there , it is safe to say , the makers of literature will always be gathered .

		Power is principally to be found in the extreme ex - hibitions of good and evil , but most in evil , for good is too characterless for delineation : light can not be realized except by contrasts of darkness .

		Beauty has both a spiritual side and a physical side ; we can not ignore either without throwing things out of balance .

		Great artists usually work from the turbid to the clear , from the sensuous to the spiritual .

		The hor - rors , the tumultuous energies of life , the delights of the senses , the charm of existence , impress them first ; afterwards come tranquillity and service of the spirit .

		In part , the objection to such themes springs from a radical misconception of the relations of imagina - tive literature pure literature to life .

		A great deal of what for lack of any other word we call '' literature '' is didactic .

		It is concerned with the training of character , the guidance of conduct .

		Through it , religion , law , order , and custom speak to man .

		Its business is instruction , restraint .

		It preaches the mortification of the flesh , the subjection of desires .

		Imaginative literature does not exist to make us good , but to make us intelligent , in the vernacular , to '' put us wise '' as to the happenings of humanity , most of which would never come within the scope of our experience ; it exists to delight and broaden and elevate our minds by reproducing and expressing life all life .

		There is no reason why it should not be permeated and aerated by the principles of religion and law .

		Generally it is .

		But though morality may be its theme , it can not be its object .

		Literature has just as much right to rebel against religions , laws , moralities , as to enforce them . ''

		One good custom may corrupt a world . ''

		Like Hamlet and
Laertes	LOCATION	, good and evil are continually changing foils .

		God does not fear truth .

		In one sense , then , we take imaginative literature too seriously when we would transfer to it the pro- vince of the pulpit or the law court .

		It does n't deal with us in that way .

		In another sense , we do not take seriously enough its potent magic , we do not realize the greatness of that cloud-life which rises from the ruins of real existence , which lives on im - mortally while the generations decay .

		The concern of didactic literature is with ethics , conduct ; the concern of imaginative literature is with ontology , being .

		The greater includes the less .

		In this coun - try there has been a good deal too much coddling of character and far too few free adventures of the intellect .

		Literature which deals with the relations of the sexes , the temptations of the flesh , is the great stum - bling-block to prudes of both sexes .

		They can toler - ate the literary presentation of all the other actions , vices , crimes , temptations of humanity , but they can - not endure the visualizing of this passion .

		How do the master poets of the world answer to their pro- tests ?

		Love , legal or illicit , is the predominant theme of their works .

		Homer bases his Iliad on the infidelity of
Helen	PERSON	.

		He defers to her beauty , says that her act was the act of the Goddess , and lets it go at that .

		Calypso in her grot , Circe on her island , are the first of the great temptresses of man - .

		The greatest of the ancient tragedies , the ''
Agamem	PERSON	- non '' and the '' QEdipus , '' are tales of adultery and in - cest .

		Virgil paints most vividly the liaison of jEneas and Dido .

		Tasso 's garden of
Armida	LOCATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's gar - den of
Acrasia	LOCATION	,
Milton	PERSON	's garden of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, are fur - nished with nude figures painted in the most glowing and alluring colors .

		These are perhaps three of the purest-minded of poets .

		It would almost seem that richness of hue and grace of line in the treatment of the nude are tests of an author 's high-mindedness .

		Tennyson is as sensuous as anyone in his ''
Merlin	PERSON	and
Vivien	PERSON	. ''


Wagner	PERSON	has
Kundry	ORGANIZATION	and her flower-girls .

		Shakespeare bares the very throbbing heart of sense in the love scenes of `` Romeo and Juliet . ''


Marlowe	PERSON	,
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Ford	ORGANIZATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	, even Pope ,
Burns	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Hugo , Musset , in fact , 518 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, everyone who has written greatly , has written frankly and freely of that passion where flesh is transfigured into spirit and spirit transformed into flesh .

		There is a vast difference in the way men and wo - men regard the literary presentation of sex subjects .

		To women , love is a mystery , something to be kept holy and secret .

		Her curiosity about it may be as great as man 's , but she wants the matter wrapped up in sentiment , in delicate innuendo , in reserves more dangerous , perhaps , than blunt dealing .

		Woman is probably responsible , more than man , for the thou - sands of novels , plays , poems , which treat the `` theme of three '' wife , husband , and lover .

		Man is the fan - tast and philosopher .

		He can be more ethereal and imaginative in his desires and emotions than woman , but the ironic earth-spirit moves in him and makes him turn the matter into unholy merriment .

		His per - suasion of the cheat of life makes him strike at the processes of life itself .

		His spirit , indignant at not finding perfection in the one relation which seems to promise it , takes revenge in ridicule .

		Hence arises a vast literature of raillery against women , an orgy of humor about the functions of sex .

		Hence the bestialities of
Aristophanes	LOCATION	,
Juvenal	ORGANIZATION	's frightful libels on women ,
Rabelais	PERSON	' overflowing animality ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's invective and descents into the gross - est realism ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's sardonic irony ,
Burns	PERSON	's frank indecencies .

		Often this kind of writing is about the profoundest thing in literature .

		At times , at least , it makes both the lofty idealisms and the common - sense proprieties of the world seem like hollow shams .

		It is a sort of skeleton at the feast , a thing at once for mirth and shuddering .

		But literature can not spare such revelations .

		A literature without such reminders of the rent the soul must pay for its ten - ure of the body would be a literature in the air ; it would be a dish lacking in salt and savor .

		Plato excluded the mischievous poets from his Republic ; the Spartans , in fact , extruded them from their community .

		It is possible that some
State	ORGANIZATION	may again try this experiment , but it is quite certain that its condition under such a reign of Fact will be worse than it was before .

		It will be a dull and gloomy tyranny .

		Not only will much of the joy and hope which goes to ease the burden of life be ban - ished , but morals themselves will deteriorate .

		The play of imagination is the safety-valve of the pas - sions .

		If you debar men from indulging in mimic passions , they will plunge all the more readily into real ones .

		Readers of sense know very well how to discrimi - nate .

		They are furnished with feelers , antennae , by which they can separate what is practical from the divine make-believe of literature .

		They are not going to commit murder because they can thrill with the spectacle of
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's guilt .

		They are not going to filch purses because they can enjoy the humor of
Fallstaff	ORGANIZATION	's exploit at
Gadshill	LOCATION	.

		They are not going to bolt with the first pleasing person of the other sex , because Cleopatra or Camille is dear to them .

		They accept imaginative literature as a vicarious ex - perience , which enlarges their minds , deepens their emotions , makes them contemporaries of all times , citizens of all places .

		They are willing to allow to the artist the utmost liberty of his materials if he can only make something of them .

		There are two statues in existence one of which represents the Muse urging the horse
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	on , while the other shows her holding him back .

		This is no bad allegory of the imaginative and didactic forces of literature in relation to life .

		The main business of the former is certainly encitement .

		Its province is to make men realize that they are alive and that they have wings .

		Unfortunately with us in
America	LOCATION	, the restraining hand is most in evidence .

		The direction of our literature has been largely un - dertaken by pedants and pedagogues who itch to use on mankind generally the ferules they are forbidden to apply to boys .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		THE MANDARIN DISEASE , the itch for honors and titles , in the intellectual no less than in the civil and political world , may yet be cured among us if other college and university presidents follow the example of

Butler	PERSON	in his current annual report , '' there has developed among the colleges and schools of the
United States	LOCATION	a deplorable form of educational snobbery , which insists that a candi - date for appointment to a teaching position shall have gained the privilege of writing the letters Ph.D. .

		after his name , '' while , as a matter of fact , `` few persons are less well equipped to make good college and secondary school teachers than the most recent possessors of the degree of doctor of philosophy . ''

		Here might pertinently be quoted many passages from the late Professor
James	PERSON	's article on `` The Ph.D. .

		Octopus , '' first printed in `` The Harvard Monthly '' and now included in his just-published posthumous volume , '' Memories and Studies . ''

		For example : '' To interfere with the free development of talent , to obstruct the natural play of supply and demand in the teaching profession , to foster academic snobbery by the prestige of certain privileged insti - tutions , to transfer accredited value from essential manhood to an outward badge , to blight hopes and promote invidious sentiments , to divert the attention of aspiring youth from direct dealings with truth to the passing of examinations , such consequences , if they exist , ought surely to be regarded as draw - backs to the system , and an enlightened public consciousness ought to be keenly alive to the im - portance of reducing their amount . ''

		In a later utterance , an address on '' The College-Bred , '' also contained in the above-named volume , the same thought finds expression in different form : `` To have spent one 's youth at college , in contact with the choice and rare and precious , and yet still to be

		Probably it is only with the wisdom , and the sad - ness , of some degree of maturity , that a man learns that he is only beginning really to live when he ceases to prize the rewards of success , either his own or another 's ... MR. PULITZER 'S PLAN FOR MAKING JOURNALISTS , by richly endowing a school for their education , ap - pears to work itself out with some difficulty .

		Confer - ences are now in progress at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, of which the proposed school is intended to be a branch , to determine upon its organization and cur - riculum .

		But progress appears to be slow .

		Journal - ism , in its larger aspects , has a width and a vagueness of range that make it much harder to lay out a definite and satisfactory course of study than is true in such callings as civil engineering , for instance , or medi - cine , or law .

		Politics , art , literature , economics , pub - lic health , everything , in short , of general interest , and many things of special interest , find a place in the journals of to-day .

		A lifelong course in general information and in reading the best books , supple - mented by the necessary instruction in certain practi - cal details , seems not too comprehensive a curriculum for the thorough journalist , who at the same time should be able to write without too wide a departure from the best models .

		It is little wonder that Mr.
Pulitzer	PERSON	provided for the withholding of one-half his stipulated benefaction until the school should have proved a success in the opinion of competent judges .

		It may be well to add here an outline of the curricu - lum sketched by the founder himself in his will : The principles of law , as it pertains to journalism ; litera - ture , with special reference to the literature of poli - tics ; the study of truth and accuracy , and the art of being able to find facts when they are required , rather than cramming a student full of them in school ; his - tory , with reference to the rise and fall of nations , and the making and breaking of great public institu - tions ; economics ; modern languages to such an ex - tent as to give a newspaper man access to literature in other than his native tongue ; the ethics of journal - ism , for above all other qualifications in a journalist the testator valued '' moral sense , courage , and in - tegrity . ''

		... AN ETYMOLOGIST 'S BIRTHDAY served him recently as an occasion for making some prognostications on the future of the language whose past he has so zeal - ously studied .

		The Rev.
Walter W. Skeat	PERSON	, author of the widely and favorably known '' Etymological Dictionary , '' was interviewed on the seventy-sixth anniversary of his birth , and said or is said to have said among other things , that certain cockneyisms now in vogue are likely to become eventually the es - tablished usage , and that the careful speaker of some future generation may be expected to say '' lydy '' for '' lady , '' however much we may now shudder at such a prospect . ''

		It is East Anglian English , '' he asserted , '' which sets the fashion throughout the country .

		But it is a law of nature that language must change , and after all ' lydy ' is not more offen - sive to a cultivated ear in the present day than the word ` dame , ' as educated people pronounce it , would have been in that of Chaucer . ''

		Nevertheless , if `` lydy '' ever really becomes the accepted pronuncia - tion in
England	LOCATION	, we shall begin to see ample cause and excuse for the formation of an '' American lan - guage '' in good earnest , and for a declaration of linguistic independence of the mother country .

		Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	indulged further in some interesting personal reminiscences .

		He recalled his four years ' curacy at
East Durham	LOCATION	, which was followed by a two years ' service in a like capacity at
Godalming	LOCATION	.

		Then en - sued illness and enforced idleness , after which he returned to
Cambridge	LOCATION	and was made lecturer on mathematics at
Christ 's College	ORGANIZATION	.

		And when , a little later , Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	founded the Early English Text Society , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	began to edit eai ` ly texts for him .

		Thirty years were spent in preparing '' Piers Plow - man '' unremunerative work , certainly , but luckily the learned editor was not then , and is not now , un - der the necessity of earning his bread and cheese , as he expressed it .

		... THE PUBLIC CLAMOR FOR NEW BOOKS threatens to deafen the librarian of any public library in a community not hopelessly somnolent in its habits .

		In the current report of the
Galesburg	LOCATION	-LRB-
Illinois	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library , lament is made over the insufficiency of the annual appropriation for new books and the consequent impairment of the library 's usefulness .

		`` The experience of other libraries has been the same , '' continues
Miss Hoover	PERSON	, '' for reports show that a reduction in the purchase of books is invariably followed by a decrease in the use of the library . ''

		Dr.
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	on one occasion expressed his astonishment at the rate of growth noted by him in the library of the college with which his name is so inseparably associated . ''

		Why , '' he exclaimed , '' there are hundreds of old books here that I have never read , and still you are buying new ones every month ! ''

		The old books , or a small fraction of them , have their use and their enduring vitality ; but the interpretation of the life we are now living demands a never-ceasing addition to the store of existing literature .

		Hence the call for a new book from nineteen readers , with only the twentieth one content to receive a time-worn and time-tested classic .

		THE RE-BIRTH OF
NEW YORK	LOCATION	'S STATE LIBRARY , the rising of this pho3nix from its ashes of
last March	DATE	, must necessarily be a slow process ; but a liberal leg - islative appropriation has made possible the vigorous prosecution of the work of obtaining new collections to replace as far as possible the old , and of providing an adequate fire-proof building for their early recep - tion .

		A circular sent out by the
Library	ORGANIZATION	makes the safe assertion that '' it would be too much to expect to make the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	greater than 520 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, all other libraries in all particulars .

		Though it will have some books on most subjects , it can not undertake to collect all the books or even all the important books on all subjects . ''

		The constituency of the
Library	ORGANIZATION	tends under modern methods to become as wide as the
State	ORGANIZATION	, or even wider ; and the range of its mate - rial must be no narrow one .

		Especial attention , however , will be given to the following ten classes : general reference books , law , medicine , history , edu - cation , social science , technology and engineering , science , manuscripts , government documents .

		Tend - ers are invited from all who have books to offer that are within the scope of the proposed collections .

		Fur - ther particulars may be obtained from the librarian , Mr.J .

		LWyer , Jr. ... MISLEADING BOOK-TITLES , like
Raskin	PERSON	's `` Notes on the Construction of Sheepf olds , '' and many another in his list of works , are sufficiently common , and sufficiently vexatious to the library cataloguer , who can hardly spend time to read a volume through in order to determine its proper classification .

		Recently some glaring instances were reported from theBritish Museum by Dr.
C. K. Fortescue	PERSON	, keeper of printed books in that institution .

		He says it is no uncommon thing for the author of a plain and unpretending book about Sussex to christen it with some such name as `` The Glittering Glades of Grassland . ''

		A certain treatise on natural history is disguised under the title '' Music of the Wild , '' and a work named '' Light for the Blind '' turns out to be an appeal in behalf of African missions . ''

		Earl
Percy	PERSON	's Dinner Table '' sounds like the title of a historical novel , or of a racy collection of anecdotes and witty conversation ; whereas it designates a sober history of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		The number of misleading book-titles familiar to library workers , and to omnivorous read - ers , is not small .

		A list of some length could be drawn up without any great difficulty .

		A NEW SERIES OF WAK PAPERS BY GENERAL
MORRIS SCHAFF	PERSON	, to be entitled `` The Death of the Confederacy , `` announced by the `` Atlantic Monthly '' for next year , is a matter for congratulation .

		Gen - eral
Schaff	PERSON	's former series , '' The Spirit of Old West Point '' and '' The Battle of the Wilderness , '' won for him perhaps as solid a literary reputation as has been gained by any American in the past few years .

		And though the word '' solid '' as applied to literary work too often denotes the conventional or the stodgy , this is certainly not the case with
General Schaff	ORGANIZATION	's productions .

		History more flushed with emotion , more aerated with imagination , has seldom been writ - ten .

		His '' Dream March to the Wilderness , '' in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' for
last May	DATE	, is worthy of the best days of that magazine .

		... THE BUSINESS OF MYTH-SMASHING carries some merited odium with it .

		To pull down is easier than to build up , but the facile downpuller has ever felt an exultant sense of superiority to the laborious up - builder .

		Among recent destructive criticisms of time - honored legends have been the highly unnecessary and irrelevant demonstration of the baselessness of the story of
John Gilpin	PERSON	's exciting ride , and the all but sacrilegious contradiction of the accepted account of Captain
John Parker	PERSON	's exhortation to his Minute Men to stand their ground on
Lexington	LOCATION	Common .

		More recently still a literal-minded clergyman of Ply - mouth is said to have found proof to convince him , and with which he has tried to convince others , that Miles
Standish	PERSON	did not send
John Alden	PERSON	to propose in his name to the Puritan maiden
Priscilla	PERSON	, and that consequently she could not have made the arch reply attributed to her .

		Such iconoclasm as this has its charms , as all know who have engaged in it even to a slight extent .

		... THE ENDOWED PRINTING HOUSE , non-commercial in its aims , and devoted to the publication of schol - arly and deserving works that must otherwise fail to see the light , has yet to establish itself among us an educational agency comparable with the en - dowed or free library , the endowed college or uni - versity , the endowed lecture course , or the -LRB- still in the experimental stage -RRB- endowed theatre .

		The Har - vard '' Crimson '' makes an appeal for an endowed
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	that shall do for Ameri - can scholarship what similar presses at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	have long been doing for English letters and learning .

		Such an establishment would , as the writer estimates , cost something like one hundred thousand dollars to build and to equip for handling works not confined to our own language ; and at least an equal sum would be needed as an endowment .

		Not a few of our universities have special funds for the publishing of certain serials or studies , and occa - sionally some sort of printing establishment under their control , but nothing of the sort that can com - pare with the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		... HELLENIC STUDIES AT OXFORD will not quite yet be abandoned in favor of aeronautic engineering or other scientific or vocational courses .

		By a vote of five hundred and ninety-five to three hundred and sixty , the Oxonians have defeated a movement to exempt from Greek all students in mathematics and the sciences .

		This was not , it is true , a proposal to banish Greek entirely , but it was felt to be a step in that direction , and the conservatives rallied strongly to oppose the radicals .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE IRISH THEATRE SOCIETY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As one phase of the general movement for the uplift of the drama in
America	LOCATION	, many of your readers are no doubt interested in the remarkable achievements of the organization known as the Irish Players , in several
East	LOCATION	- ern cities this season .

		This brilliant company , accom - panied by the two moving spirits of the
Irish National Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	, Lady
Gregory	PERSON	and Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	, has visited
Boston	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, and is now playing in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The Society was founded seven years ago , primarily to further the Irish literary move - ment .

		The plays were in many cases written to meet the need for them , and the players for there were then no Irish actors were trained to give the plays .

		The first company , of unpaid amateurs , was recruited from the working people of
Dublin	LOCATION	; they worked by day and rehearsed and acted at night , for love of '' the art of the theatre . ''

		Thus , out of love for
Ireland	LOCATION	and a belief in the dramatic value of Irish poetry and Irish thought , grew the Irish Theatre Society .

		That it has called into being Lady
Gregory	PERSON	's charming comedies , is much to its credit ; that it encouraged and has worthily produced Mr.
Synge	PERSON	's masterpieces , is more .

		When the English censor forbade the performance of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's ''
Shew	PERSON	- ing up of Blanco Posnet , '' the Abbey Theatre presented it with triumphant success .

		The Society has had its troubles .

		There were riots in
Dublin	LOCATION	over Mr.
Synge	PERSON	's '' Playboy . ''

		The
Boston	LOCATION	woman who , wearied by the quiet realism of Mr.
Boyle	PERSON	's '' Building Fund , '' exclaimed disgustedly , when the curtain rose on the last act , '' I thought at least they 'd have a wake ! ''

		is a type of the great unappreciative public who see nothing impressive in the simple plays which the Irish actors perform so simply and convincingly .

		But interest in the movement has grown steadily , and with it a taste for sincere and original drama and sincere and quiet acting .

		More pre - tentious experimenters in the work of dramatic uplifting well stand amazed at what has been done in
Dublin	LOCATION	with a very limited expenditure , by a disinterested artistic management , and a company of splendid achievements and of high ideals .

		LITERATURE AND THE CUSTOM HOUSE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with full appreciation the article on Dog - berry at the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, in your issue of
Novem	DATE	- ber 16 .

		The attitude of the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	toward the interests of the publishers , the men who are doing their share in behalf of the higher educa - tion of the country , is not in line with the progress of civilization .

		Under the provisions of the Copyright law , the American publishers are prevented from controlling the market , which in form has been assigned to them , and have simply the privilege of competing in this mar - ket with trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	publishers .

		Under the tariff provisions , the cost of all of the articles required for the production of books is kept high as proportioned to the prices paid for similar materials by trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	competitors , and the conse - quent difference in the selling price of American edi - tions or at least of a portion of such editions is then assigned as a ground for the admission , irrespective of copyright conditions , of the trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	editions of American copyrighted books .

		Such a decision is arrived at by joint committee of the two Houses , composed in majority of protectionists , who are themselves respon - sible for the policy that makes books dearer than they ought to be .

		In the instance which served as the text for your admirable article , the publishers who undertake to supply the market with imported editions are treated as malefactors , and are subjected , under arbitrary and unannounced changes in the interpretation of the con - fused provisions of the statute , not only to the payment of excessive duties duties which must stand largely in the way of the sale of the books in question and of future importations of similar books but to the risk of penalties on the top of those duties .

		These penalties were to be imposed because these wicked publishers , having been importing under one interpretation of the law for a long series of years , had not been able to foresee the mental attitude of some later Dogberry in the
Treasury Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ment or in the office of the Appraisers who might decide to change the method .

		There is not another country in the world that treats the interests of literature in so mediaeval a fashion .

		THE UNFORTUNATES AMONG COLLEGE PROFESSORS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I venture my word of commendation of your recent article on '' Pensions and the Learned Profes - sions , '' especially the observation that '' In the adminis - trator 's heaven there is more joy over one sinner who is thwarted than there is grief over the lost opportunities of ninety-and-nine righteous persons who need no thwarting . ''

		There is much truth in this .

		A professor may have reached or exceeded the required age , and may have fulfilled the requisite number of years of professorial service ; but if he happen to have lost his chair , even through no fault of his own , he is met at the door of the Pension Trustees ' office with the unwelcome greeting , '' I know not whence you come .

		Depart into the outer courts , where you may cool your heels ad libitum . ''

		It may be that there are so many of these unfortunates that to admit them would `` swamp '' the Fund ; but we are informed that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, in the goodness of his heart , has made such addition to his various Funds that the amount received by the Pension Fund may enable the Trustees to widen the terms of admission to its benefits .

		Wherein do these `` unfor - tunates '' differ from the more blessed ones who have been so fortunate as to retain their chairs until they have fulfilled the terms imposed by the Trustees , which appear to be like the laws of the Medes and Persians ?

		All poor professors are grateful to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	for his liberality in establishing such a Fund , but I respect - fully submit that the terms might be made more liberal on which the benefits are dispensed .

		522 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, THE STORY OF A GREAT SOUJL .

		* '' I hear it often said by my friends , '' wrote
Ruskin	PERSON	in an unpublished preface for one of his later books , '' that my writings are trans - parent , so that I may myself be clearly seen through them .

		They are so , and what is seen of me through them is clearly seen ; yet I know no other author of candour who has given so partial , so disproportioned , so steadily re - served a view of his personality . ''

		Whatever of paradox there might be in these words , they were written , of course , before the publication of '' Prseterita . ''

		Had that work been carried through to completion ,
Ruskin	PERSON	's statement could have been reversed , and we might truly say that no other author of candor had given us so com - plete , so symmetrical , so entirely frank a view of his personality .

		But the fiery intellect had burned itself out when '' Praeterita '' was little more than half completed ; and '' that most heavenly book '' -LRB- so
Burne	PERSON	- Jones rightly called it -RRB- remains but a fragment of autobiography .

		But those who would see
Ruskin	PERSON	steadily and see him whole have not lacked for opportunity .

		In the twelve years since his death , there has been an avalanche of personal reminiscences and Ruskiniana of every conceivable sort , the Bibliography in the
Library Edition	ORGANIZATION	contains entry of over 1200 items .

		Chiefly , of course , there have been Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's excellent '' Life and Work of Ruskin '' and ''
Ruskin	PERSON	Relics '' ; and Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's volume in the `` English Men of Letters '' series .

		And now Mr.
E. T. Cook	PERSON	, fresh from his labors on the monumental Library Edition , puts forth in two large volumes of six hundred pages each what must be considered the definitive biography of Ruskin the final authority on that end - lessly interesting life .

		Of his capabilities for the task now completed , Mr.
Cook	PERSON	gave pre - liminary proof in his collection of '' Studies in
Ruskin	LOCATION	, '' published several years ago .

		He was one of that brilliant group of undergraduates at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	upon whom
Ruskin	PERSON	cast his spell in the early seventies , and who became thenceforth his avowed disciples and intimate associates .

		As chief editor of the
Library Edition	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Cook	PERSON	has for several years past been going over every available scrap of
Ruskin	PERSON	records diaries , note-books , unpublished manuscript , etc. ; and it is he who is responsible for the extended bio - * THE LIFE OF
JOHN RUSKIN	PERSON	.

		By
E. T. Cook	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		graphical and critical introductions which are so important a feature of the noble edition just referred to .

		These introductions form the basis of the Life now published .

		Minor changes have necessarily been made , the arrangement is considerably al - tered , and new matter has been added ; but in very considerable part Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's `` Life of
John Ruskin	PERSON	'' is a word-for-word reprint of the intro - ductions preparedfor the
Library Edition	ORGANIZATION	.

		That this fact is not fairly stated in the author 's Pre - fatory Note , gives occasion for the one word of censure to be found against the present work .


Ruskin	PERSON	's life was , as he himself said of it , '' persistently literary . ''

		For all his European travels , and acquaintanceship with the great of his time , the life he led was in the main private and secluded .

		A biography of him must there - fore , as Mr.
Cook	PERSON	points out , '' be the story of a soul , '' - '' the account , mainly , of a character , a temperament , an influence ; and seldom , of events on the stage of public action . ''

		Ruskin himself believed that a principal function of biog - raphy was to reveal what is '' beautiful or woe - ful '' in an individual soul .

		In
Ruskin	PERSON	's life , the beautiful and the woeful were abundantly and wondrously mixed ; his path seemed , for the most part , a via dolorosa which yet led somehow along the borders of Fairyland .

		To trace that strange path , to analyze that complex character and many-sided intellect , to summarize the quality and influence of that life-work of colossal in - dustry , here was a task that might well appal the most skilful biographer .

		But Mr.
Cook	PERSON	faces it all squarely , and comes off triumphant .

		On the biographical side , he makes liberal drafts upon unpublished material in the way of dia - ries , note-books , and letters , as well as upon `` Prseterita '' and ''
Fors Clavigera	PERSON	, '' thus letting
Ruskin	PERSON	in large measure tell his own story .

		The more original part of the work lies in Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's detailed accounts of the character and fortune and influence of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's books .

		His aim has been always to illustrate the works by the life and the life by the works .

		It was scarcely to be expected that Mr.
Cook	PERSON	, or anyone else , could give us much in the way of actual fact regarding
Ruskin	PERSON	's life that was not already known .

		The essential part of all that is known , however , he selects with invari - able good judgment and presents in admirable form .

		In dealing with
Ruskin	PERSON	's unfortunate marriage , he tells us much more than did Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	; yet there is not the slightest con - cession to the class of readers that consume Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's vulgar revelations .

		He recognizes

		THE DIAL 523 fully -LRB- as fully , even , as did
Ruskin	PERSON	himself -RRB- the faults and limitations of the master 's character the `` dangerous and lonely pride , '' the wayward - ness , the '' tendency to absolutism , petulance , over-emphasis . ''

		Such incidents as the quarrel with
Rossetti	PERSON	and the misunderstanding with
Gladstone	PERSON	are dealt with in a spirit of unim - peachable fairness .

		But Mr.
Cook	PERSON	never con - fuses accidentals with essentials ; for him , as for all who read his pages , it is the nobility and beauty and strength of
Ruskin	PERSON	's character that overshadow all else . ''

		He is not a man , '' said Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, who knew him perhaps as intimately as any , `` but a stray angel , who has singed his wings a little and tumbled into our sphere . ''

		There are three great divisions in all men 's lives ,
Ruskin	PERSON	wrote in ''
Fors Clavigera	PERSON	, '' `` the days of youth , of labour , and of death .

		Youth is properly the forming time that in which a man makes himself , or is made , what he is for ever to be .

		Then comes the time of labour , when , having become the best he can be , he does the best he can do .

		Then the time of death , which , in happy lives is very short ; but always a time .

		The ceasing to breathe is only the end of death . ''

		Of
Ruskin	PERSON	's own life this statement is peculiarly true .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's first volume deals with the period of youth the period , that is , from
Ruskin	PERSON	's birth , in
1819	DATE	, to the completion of `` Modern Painters , '' in
1860	DATE	.

		The years of childhood are covered so fully in '' Praeterita '' that but a single chapter is given to them here .

		It was with that fateful gift , on his thirteenth birthday , of a copy of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Italy	LOCATION	, '' with
Turner	PERSON	's illustrations , that the career of
Ruskin	PERSON	really begins .

		His work in life as an interpreter of
Turner	PERSON	and of Nature was then decided for him ; with that day began a quarter-century of `` quiet investigation of beautiful things , '' the chief or at least the most immediate result of which was '' Modern Painters . ''

		With the ex - ception of a youthful love affair which came to nothing , his life during this period was continu - ously and blessedly happy .

		But for some time before the last volume of '' Modern Painters '' had appeared , a new spirit was dawning in Rus - kin a growing sense of the evil of the world , '' the terrible call of human crime for resistance and of human misery for help . ''

		With this cry ringing in his ears , the interpretation of art be - came a mockery .

		Abandoning all other plans ,
Ruskin	PERSON	set hi m self resolutely to attack the dragon .

		With the appearance of '' Unto This Last '' in
1860	DATE	-LRB- `` the beginning of the days of reproba - tion , '' he calls it -RRB- began
Ruskin	PERSON	's true '' time of labour . ''

		Thenceforth for him there was to be almost continuous warfare , and but little peace , until that decade of '' the time of death '' which closed at Brantwood in
1900	DATE	.

		It is this period , from
1860	DATE	to the end , that is covered in Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's second volume .

		Of the various transi - tions in
Ruskin	LOCATION	's life-work , the author gives us this excellent summary : '' Unpractical as he is commonly called , and as in the vulgar sense he certainly was ,
Ruskin	PERSON	was strongly pos - sessed by the instinct and passion for practice .

		His de - sire was to do things , and to set others to doing them .

		Starting as a critic of painting , he had arrived at the conclusion that art , to be really fine , must be the repre - sentation of beautiful realities and be pursued in a spirit of delight .

		Proceeding as a critic of architecture , he had found this art to be the reflection of national char - acter , and the secret of good Gothic to consist in the happy life of the workman .

		Turning next to the study of economics , he saw , in a society ordered on the princi - ples of unregulated competition , and in an age given over to mechanical and material ideas , the negation of conditions favourable to happy art .

		The final step was , to one of his ardent temperament , clear and simple .

		He was not content to live in a world of the imagination ; he strove to realise the conditions of the good and beautiful in the actual world to build the Tabernacle of God among men .

		It was not that he wanted to be a social reformer , or that he felt himself in any way peculiarly qualified for the part .

		His Prophetic work was not of choice , but of necessity .

		It was a payment of ransom . '

		I simply can not paint , nor read , nor look at minerals , nor do anything else that I like ... because of the misery that I know of . '

		He had to clear himself ` from all sense of responsibility for this material distress , by doing what he could to point a way to the cure of it .

		His work in this kind was begun , he tells us , ' as a byework to quiet my conscience , that I might be happy in what I supposed to be my own proper life of art-teaching . ' ''

		One of the most interesting chapters of the present Life is that entitled '' In a Literary Workshop , '' describing
Ruskin	PERSON	's methods of composition , his relations with printers and en - gravers , and similar matters . ''

		As one who has lived behind the scenes , as it were , of
Ruskin	PERSON	's pageant of style , '' and who `` has been admitted to all the secrets of his literary workshop , '' Mr.
Cook	PERSON	speaks here with particular authority .

		There is much quotable material in this chapter , but we prefer to give this characteristic picture of
Ruskin	PERSON	in one of the later Oxford lecture courses : '' I recall another effective piece of what may be called the lecturer 's stage-play .


Ruskin	PERSON	was expatiating , as was his wont , on the vandalism of the modern world .

Turner	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The old stone bridge is pictur - esque , ' he said , ' is n't it ?

		But of course you want some - thing more `` imposing '' nowadays .

		So you shall have it . '

		And taking his paint-box and brush he rapidly sketched in on the glass what is known in modern specifications as a ' handsome iron structure . ' '

		Then , ' he continued , ' you will want , of course , some tall factory chimneys , 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, and I will give them to you galore . '

		Which he pro- ceeded to do in like fashion . '

		The blue sky of heaven was pretty , but you can not have everything , you know . '

		And he painted clouds of black smoke over
Turner	LOCATION	's sky . '

		Your '' improvements , '' he went on , ' are marvellous `` triumphs of modern industry , '' I know ; but somehow they do not seem to produce nobler men and women , and no modern town is complete , you will admit , with - out a gaol and a lunatic asylum to crown it .

		So here they are for you . '

		By which time not an inch of the
Turner	PERSON	drawing was left visible under the ' improve - ments ' painted upon the glass . '

		But for my part , ' said
Raskin	PERSON	, taking his sponge , and with one pass of the hand wiping away those modern improvements against which he had inveighed in so many printed volumes ' for my part , I prefer the old . ' ''

		There is a certain saying , much current in the dilettante world at present , to the effect that '' we have got past
Ruskin	PERSON	now . ''

		On this point let us have the evidence of Mr.
Cook	PERSON	, speaking in his capacity as
Ruskin	PERSON	bibliographer : '' The very period which is said to mark the eclipse of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's authority as a writer upon art and nature has been the period which has witnessed the greatest extension of the vogue of his books on those subjects .

		I will not dwell upon the great flood of cheap reprints in the English language , which during recent years have made
Ruskin	PERSON	an author for the many , instead of an au - thor for the few .

		This , it may be said , is merely a case of the vulgar entering upon a field which superior per - sons have abandoned .

		But there is another feature in the Bibliography of
Ruskin	LOCATION	which is significant .

		Since the days when he laid down his pen , he has ceased to be only an English author , and has become a world-author Many of his books , and especially his books upon art , have been translated into French , German , Italian , Span - ish , Swedish , Hungarian .

		I am not aware that
Ruskin	PERSON	has been translated into Russian , but
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's appre - ciation of him is well known .

		He regarded
Ruskin	PERSON	as the greatest Englishman of his time .

		Ruskin 's writings have been the subject also of essays or treatises in
Belgium	LOCATION	, in
Holland	LOCATION	, in
Denmark	LOCATION	, in
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		And the foreign vogue of
Ruskin	PERSON	has been greatest in the countries where aesthetic criticism is pursued with the greatest ardour .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	,
Herr Engel	PERSON	may have set the fashion , for in his History of English Liter - ature -LRB- 1897 -RRB- he commended
Ruskin	PERSON	to German readers as ` the Englishman 's
Winckelmann	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	in one . '


Ruskin	PERSON	has become a favourite theme for
University	ORGANIZATION	dissertations in
Germany	LOCATION	; elaborate commentaries have been devoted to him ; and on the occasion of his death , and in years immediately following it , his life and work attracted notice in German periodicals hardly less wide - spread than in
England	LOCATION	itself .

		` In the last twenty years , ' said Professor Sieper in a recent lecture in
London	LOCATION	, '
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	more than any other Englishmen have influenced German thought . '

		In .


France	LOCATION	it is much the same , and nowhere has
Ruskin	PERSON	found more sympathetic or discerning criticism than is to be found in the abundant series of ' studies ' which have appeared in
Paris	LOCATION	during recent years . ''

		The simple truth is , of course , that we can never `` get past
Ruskin	PERSON	, '' were his so-called aesthetic and economic '' heresies '' a thousand times more heretical than they are . ''

		Every noble life , '' as he has himself told us , '' leaves the fibre of it interwoven for ever in the work of the world ; by so much , evermore , the strength of the human race has gained . ''

		However erro - neous his artistic teaching may have been , Rus - kin gave to the study of art an impetus and a vitality it had never known before , and of which true artists for generations to come will reap abundant benefits .

		And though in our broad human relations we still reject
Ruskin	PERSON	's moral teaching , as indeed we reject that of Christ , most of the specific reforms which he was the first to suggest , and for which he so valiantly fought , have become the accepted commonplaces of to-day .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's biography is indisputably the '' book of the year , '' to ardent disciples of
Ruskin	PERSON	it is indeed the book of many years .

		Next to the earnest study of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's own writ - ings , we could scarcely conceive of a more in - spiring and beneficial discipline than to follow through Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's pages the detailed life-story of this noblest and wisest spirit of his age .

		Carlyle and
Emerson	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	, and many another great intellect , were of that age , also ; but
Ruskin	PERSON	could truly have said with the apostle , '' I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me . ''

		The two volumes are comely in all external details .

		Five portraits in photogravure and a facsimile page of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's MS. are included by way of illustration ; while a full and well-pre - pared Index is a feature of no little importance .

		A few typographical errors might well be cor - rected in the next edition , such , for example , as '' to '' for '' the '' on page 118 , and '' world - less '' for '' wordless '' in the quotation from
Cory	PERSON	's '' Mimnermus in Church '' on page 265 both in the second volume .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifllin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1911 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 525 his latest volume , '' Democracy and Poetry , '' we have the
N. W. Harris	PERSON	Lectures delivered this year at
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It may be well to recall the main thesis of Professor
Gummere	PERSON	's work of a decade since on the origins of poetry .

		He has there shown that poetry was in its origin a social creation , essentially communal .

		In its humble begin - nings , consent and rhythm played important parts .

		The communal element at first existed to an almost exclusive degree ; only '' after long ages of alternating collective and individual forces , working within the social union , was the individual socially free to make himself master in a wholly social art . ''

		Thus there was a con - stant alternation of social-centripetal and indi - vidual-centrifugal impulses , amid which poetry steadily advanced .

		The surviving representa - tive of communal forces is rhythm : '' that con - sent of sympathy which is perhaps the noblest thing in all human life . ''

		It is for this reason that poetry , even in mediocrity , does more than prose at its best .

		For poetry is both tonic and opiate ; and it owes its appeal to-day to the same elements that informed primitive poetry the consent of rhythm and the power of human sympathy .

		The present volume may be regarded as a sequel to the work mentioned .

		In the
Harris Lectures	ORGANIZATION	, Professor Gum mere deals with the communal origins of poetry and with the rela - tion between democratic ideals and the life and vogue of poetry .

		The book is not easy reading ; there is , for example , one paragraph of fifteen pages , and another of eleven ; and such a thing as a topic-sentence is a positive rarity .

		We shall therefore do readers a service by giving some account of its course of thought .

		In the opening chapter , dealing with the ideals and vitality of democracy , Professor
Gummere	PERSON	notes the numerous defections from the ranks of supporters of democracy
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Burke	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Renan	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and then asks what it is that they recanted .

		He finds it to be the literal absolute sovereignty of the people ; that cause has failed .

		The long struggle for freedom has passed beyond its goal into license and abuse of power .

		The miscarriage of democracy is due , he thinks , to the influence of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		In consequence of that influence , the spirit of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	's de - mocracy , where every man could say '' My coun - try , '' has yielded to a spirit in which every man says '' My self . ''

		Yet there is no need for the believer in a new democratic social order to be discouraged ; the cause has been not lost but merely checked .

		In his second chapter , Mr.
Gummere	PERSON	con - siders the reaction against democracy more at length .

		The constructive idea of free individ - uals combining in service and allegiance to an imagined state has not yet been tested by ex - perience .

		On the other hand , in philosophy , science , history , literature , there has been a gen - eral recanting of the democratic idea .

		Events formerly explained as emanating from a confed - eracy of people or of natural forces are now ex - plained as made up of individual initiative and a collective imitation .

		Science and history have turned monarchical , and explain all social pro- cesses on a monarchical basis .

		In general , his - tory has been shorn of the democratic idea .

		The democratic movement , however , has left its im - press on the science of poetry .

		It aroused a gen - eral desire to enlarge knowledge of mankind . ' '

		The People ' ' got a n e w meaning .

		For Herder , who goes to the centre of things , the supreme ideal is justice ; he dedicated his selection of folk - songs to the
Unseen Powers of Righteousness and Justice	ORGANIZATION	.

		In poetic justice , the democratic ideal of the people found its best expression .

		In the theories and history of verse , however , the demo - cratic idea was ruined by perversions and absurd - ities .


Montesquieu	LOCATION	and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, with their optimistic faith in the Thinker , give way to
Anatole France	LOCATION	, for whom thinking is the most dangerous of occupations .

		In the midst of this collapse ,
Whitman	PERSON	and
Taine	PERSON	proclaimed the triumph of democracy in poetry .

		Were they real exponents of the central democratic idea ?

		The third chapter takes up these two men at some length .

		Whitman is plainly the democrat in poetry .

		Are his best works really poems ?

		Professor
Gummere	PERSON	thinks not .

		Whitman re - fused to keep step , was lawless .

		His poetic democ - racy , being purely destructive , can not stand . ''

		He can not be the poet of democracy in its highest ideal who rejects the democratic idea of submission to the highest social order , to the spirit of the laws , to that imagined community . ''

		In this view of Whitman , many readers to-day will probably not concur .

		Yet we believe Mr.
Gummere	PERSON	's prophecy a safe one .

		We would , however , raise this question : Has the race in - herited the feeling for rhythm to such an extent that
Whitman	PERSON	's indifference to this shall of itself consign him to oblivion ?

		That much of Whit - man 's work will be forgotten , except to be occa - sionally rediscovered in a doctoral dissertation , we may well believe ; but there are other reasons for what we think is a growing indifference to this poet of an outgrown democracy .


Browning	PERSON	with whom , it is interesting to note , Professor 526 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Triggs	PERSON	has linked Whitman in a study of democ - racy in poetry kept step , and indeed was one of our most skilful metrists ; yet
Browning	PERSON	's popu - larity has of late very perceptibly waned , and the centenary of his birth will , unless we are much mistaken , arouse far less interest than it would have done twenty years ago .

		Was there not in both
Browning	PERSON	and Whitman a certain lack of artistic restraint , a certain failure to appre - hend what is the true realm of poetry , which is a matter not only of rhythm but of atmosphere , of truly heightened feeling ?

		On the other hand ,
Taine	PERSON	, hater of political democracy as of unbridled license , is at the same time the most resolute and extreme representative of that democracy in science and in the theory of art that Whitman defied .

		He sought to ex - plain poetry by convention , to ground the science of it on the community alone .

		The flaw in such a doctrine , the lecturer rightly points out , is its hostility to the contribution of individual initia - tive .

		The genius of the individual poet can not be ignored .

		In discussing `` The Functional Origins of Poetry , '' Professor
Gummere	PERSON	studies at some length -LRB- as a typical source -RRB- the social or commu - nal pang of death .

		When the lament for the dead came to be recorded , it had two elements : the communal or choral and the personal .

		As the latter waxed , the former waned .

		In time , the expression of grief passed into a fourfold formula : the fact of death , the reminiscence , the questioning why , the appeal to come back .

		In showing how from these threnodic elements , through repetition , epic and narrative arose , Professor
Gummere	PERSON	traverses ground already covered in '' The Popular Ballad . ''

		It is possible that he carries somewhat too far the contrast between the centripetal or contracting and the centrifugal or expanding tendencies .

		The an - alogy of these two kinds of motion is suggestive , but , beyond a certain point , we think , misleading .

		As Professor
Gummere	PERSON	himself says -LRB- page 202 -RRB- , almost from the outset the man who knew how the artist was heard gladly by the throng .

		Did not the individual constantly reinforce the throng , interpret the thought of the throng ?

		Did not the aristocracy grow out of , instead of being sharply contrasted to , the democracy ?

		Again , who are the throng , the commune ?

		Are they not in a sense the picked men of the tribe , its best brains and hearts , its leaders ?

		And after all , is the difference between the individual and the throng one of kind , or rather one of degree of enthusiasm or inspiration ?

		If the supposition is right that the prophetic `` I '' of Scripture is now and then communal , this may have its bearing on the doctrine of inspiration .

		In '' Democracy in Poetry , '' Mr.
Gummere	PERSON	now undertakes to trace the democratic origins of poetry , returning to the old problem of how das
Volk	PERSON	dichtet : of what part the folk has played in the beginnings of poetry .

		The essence of folk-song is feeling ; that of the poetry of the individual is thought .

		Here again we hesitate to draw a line of sharp contrast ; for where does feeling leave off and thought begin ?

		Where does the '' I '' of songs like
Deborah	PERSON	's cease to be communal , as
Wellhausen	PERSON	thinks it was , and begin to be individual , as it sounds to us ?

		The answer is not easy .

		That feeling , communally fostered , came first , however , no one will deny . ''

		To primitive man the community was ... the promise and potency of all social advance , his hope of progress , the refuge of his baffled indi - viduality '' ; one may add , constantly less baffled as the race progressed .

		In the last chapter , '' AlmaPoesis , `` our author undertakes to show how poetry has dealt with myth and religion , and how she fares to-day .

		Just as recorded literature is late , he would have us believe that the myths of literature are late .

		Primitive myths , he holds , are of communal origin ; and thus , through mythology , religion itself traces its descent from the rhythms of swaying choral throngs .

		Less convincing is the author 's treatment of comedy and tragedy . ''

		In very broad generalization it may be said that the social group is the haunt of comedy , and that tragedy is the path of the solitary poet . ''

		This seems to us little less sweeping than
Buecher	PERSON	's contention that tragedy is entirely foreign to early man .

		Was not the death of the boar-hunter , gored by the enraged animal , tragic to the throng that chanted the communal lament -LRB- such as is studied in Chapter IV . -RRB-

		?

		Following up his theory , Mr.
Gummere	PERSON	is con - fronted by the fact that one hundred out of three hundred and five ballads are purely tragic , and is forced to conclude that all of these hundred are modern in matter while ancient in form .

		But is this conclusion necessary ?

		It is not only the single life that is tragic .

		The tribe may have its tragedy , in the fall of the avalanche which wipes out a village , the fatal onslaught of wild beasts , the defeat and slaughter by a hostile tribe .

		It does not require the reflection of solitude to make these things tragic , for the personal lament -LRB- page 298 -RRB- from the start blends with that of the throng .

		With what Mr.
Gummere	PERSON	has to say on the future of poetry we are in hearty accord .

		He dis -
1911	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 527 plays a well-grounded and well-reasoned optim - ism .

		In quoting his closing words , let us say amen to the wish he expresses . ''

		This period of reaction has its poetry ; but the mood and the art of it are not permanent .

		As romance not long ago leaped to life out of such a profound and death - like swoon , so the democratic note of enthusiasm and faith will sound again , when and how we can not tell , but in its right season , and in the large utterance which hope always inspires .

		It is a pious wish that the poet who takes up that harp once more may be a democrat of this western world . ''

		THE SPELL , OF THE WILD .

		* Mr.
Enos Mills	PERSON	is becoming known as the Prophet of the
Great Rocky Mountains	ORGANIZATION	, using the word prophet in its proper sense of interpreter of the spirit .

		He proudly recognizes Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	as in certain respects his master , and is following worthily in the footsteps of Mr.
Muir	PERSON	and Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, though with the difference that he is more strictly a mountaineer than either .

		His recent book , `` The Spell of the Rockies , '' like his earlier '' Wild Life on the Rockies , '' tells thrilling stories of his fearless life , for he carries no arms in the wilds , meets electric storms on their own ground , scales mountain peaks in the dark if need be , and risks his life in a thousand ways in perfect confidence that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	will take care of him .

		One can not help wondering what Words - worth 's
Michael	PERSON	, whose mountain adventures are summed up in the words '' He had been alone In the heart of many thousand mists , '' would have to say to a man who tells a tale of a run for life with an avalanche , ending thus : '' Battling breakers with a broken oar , or racing with a broken skee , are struggles of short duration .

		The slide did not slow down , and so closely did it crowd me that , through the crashing of trees as it struck them down , I could hear the rocks and splin - tered timbers in its mass grinding together and thud - ding against obstructions over which it swept .

		These sounds , and flying broken limbs , cried to me ' Faster ! '

		and as I started to descend another steep moraine I threw away my staff and ' let go . '

		I simply flashed down the slope , dodged and rounded a cliff , turned awkwardly into
Aspen Gulch	LOCATION	, and tumbled head over heels into safety .

		Then I picked myself up , to see the slide go by within twenty feet , with great broken trees sticking out of its side , and a snow-cloud dragging above . ''

		Or what has anyone to say to a man who in his desire to read a wind-metre on a mountain top goes through this experience ? ''

		On the last slope below the metre the wind simply played with me .

		I was overthrown , tripped , knocked down , blown explosively off my feet and dropped .

		Some - times the wind dropped me heavily , but just as often it eased me down .

		I made no attempt to stand erect ; most of the time this was impossible and at all times it was very dangerous .

		Now and then the wind rolled me as I lay resting upon a smooth place .

		Advancing was akin to swimming a whirlpool or to wrestling one 's way up a slope despite the ceaseless opposition of a vigorous , tireless opponent . ''

		At last I crawled and climbed up to the buzzing cups of the metre .

		So swiftly were they rotating they formed a blurred circle , like a fast-revolving life - preserver .

		The metre showed that the wind was pass - ing with a speed of from one hundred and sixty-five to one hundred and seventy miles an hour .

		The metre blew up or , rather , flew to pieces , during a faster spurt . ''

		There are calmer chapters in the book than these , however .

		Two are devoted to beavers , and their work as `` conservationists '' is so well described that every reader must echo Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's wish that this '' patient , persistent , faithful friend of man '' might be protected .

		There is a good story of a tramp dog , another of two young grizzlies , a chapter on '' Dr.
Woodpecker	PERSON	, Tree Surgeon , '' and others on tree-seeds and insects .

		What is said about the Wealth of the Woods the beneficence of forests in mastering high winds , moderating climate , holding moisture in their `` fluffy little rugs '' and thus creating deeper and steadier streams , and in holding and gathering the rich soil which is a nation 's chief asset is especially eloquent .

		So is what is said about the criminal waste of forests by unwise cutting , and by forest fires ; and the author is apparently saved from invective against people who are greedy or careless only by the perfect '' weathering '' of his own disposition .

		What he suggests is this : '' A mud flat might itself remark , ' The thoughtless lumberman who caused my downfall is now in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	urging river improvement , ' and the shallow waters at the big bend could add , ' Our once deep channel was filled with soil from a fire-scourged mountain .

		The minister whose vacation fire caused this ruin is now a militant mis - sionary among the heathen of Cherry-Blossom laud . ' ''

		Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's book will be interesting to every - one ; for boys it is ideal , for it combines the fascination of truth with the verve and dash of great adventure .

		It is well illustrated from photographs by the author .

		It makes one ac - quainted with a live , thorough-going out-door man whose '' youthful dream was to scale peak after peak , and from the earthly spires to see the scenic world far below and far away , '' and 528 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, who has realized his dream .

		Best of all , it gives one confidence in
Nature	LOCATION	, through the confidence of a man who says of himself : `` Years of training had given me great physical endur - ance ; and this , along with a peculiar mental attitude that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	had developed in me from being alone in her wild places at all seasons , gave me a rare trust in her and an enthusiastic though unconscious confidence in the ultimate success of whatever I attempted to accom - plish out of doors . ''

		After such a book as Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's , one dreads opening another , for fear it may prove a disap - pointment ; but the first page of Mr.
St. Mars	PERSON	's '' People of the Wild '' proves such a dread un - founded .

		And of all the subjects one would ex - pect to find unlikely , he chooses for his first story the unlikeliest namely ,
Magpies	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the wit with which the particular '' Downy One '' in question is hit off engages interest at once ; and the nest-building and family-raising of this imp of mischief and his wife are most entertaining .

		The scene of these stories is
England	LOCATION	or -LRB- of most of them -RRB- northern
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
St. Mars	PERSON	knows what a difference this makes , for of his magpie he says : '' All birds live in the strictest sense of the word , but I have never known a bird so cram-full of life in all my days .

		He oozed life at every feather .

		There must have been enough electricity in his being to run a sixteen - candle-power electric light for twelve hours out of the twenty-four .

		` Go ' with him was the religion , and he gave every average Englishman who watched him for half an hour the jumps .

		He had no repose in his make-up .

		If he had lived in the
U. S. A.	LOCATION	he would have figured as the national emblem .

		In
England	LOCATION	he was not under - stood .

		In short , he was a ` live proposition . ' ''

		Other stories tell how a bob-cat , the sole sur - vivor of a wreck , terrorized a neighborhood of `` wild people '' for some weeks ; how a great white owl from
Russia	LOCATION	, named `` The White Night - mare , '' called forth all the wit of birds , weasels , and even roedeer , but was finally done to death by the grip of a pole-cat ; how a wolverene es - caped from a menagerie in which he had been dubbed `` The Saint , '' and held all the good Scotch gamekeepers at bay for a winter ; and how a '' long dog '' trained as a poacher set up business for himself and throve on his cunning .

		The stories are wittily told not brutally and make for sympathy with all animal life .

		One of the best is about a raven , the Master Rogue , '' whose beak was a coal-hammer , no less ; his carriage the carriage of a swashbuckler , and in the eye the cruel , insolently humorous eye was the leer of evil , not without courage , made manifest . ''

		This avian Mephistopheles decoyed a collector into watching a dummy nest all sum - mer , while he and his wife safely kept their real house a mile away .

		A dainty book for comfortable fireside read - ing is Mr.
Charles Francis Saunders	PERSON	's `` A Win - dow in Arcady . ''

		The observations are of field , meadow , stream , and woodland , taken through the year , beginning in
January	DATE	.

		Most of them were apparently made in
Eastern Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The pathos of the dedication to the memory of the writer 's wife , '' who shared with him these
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	paths , '' does not intrude upon the book except to give it tenderness .

		There is much good sense in the volume , and much humor . ''

		Most people who think themselves fond of na - ture , '' Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	says , '' yet make the mis - take of keeping too much indoors when it rains .

		If you have mackintosh and rubbers you are weather-proof , and it is not meet that the ducks should put a man to shame . ''

		There is a broad view of the points at which growing things touch human life , and grey-haired readers will be glad to find reminiscences of elderberry-tea , wild - cherry tonic , and musk-roses .

		But most notice - able is the delicacy of perception which sees every shade of color and turn of leaf , and notes every passing fragrance .

		Even the flowers '' that

		No invidious comparisons need to be set up between these simultaneous lives of Luther , for both are works of true distinction , highly honorable to American scholarship , ade - quately illustrated , with an almost identical grouping of matter in the chapters , and present - ing a very satisfactory agreement in the main results studies which may well fix the place of Luther for , say , the next thirty years , inasmuch as each generation demands a sympathetic but modern handling of so large a subject .

		THE DIAL , 529 revolutionary forces of the sixteenth century , viewing him in connection with the general framework and the significant tides of world - history , and showing clearly that the crashing downfall of the Roman church-power was not due to any sudden act of intolerable tyranny , but came because the gradually increasing load had reached the breaking-strain .

		The essential character of this period as an outburst of the democratic spirit , when the common man be - lieved that he was at last coming into his rights , is emphasized in both .

		Neither of them touches on that most interesting theme ,
Tindale	PERSON	's close relation to Luther , and , accordingly , on the Lutheran elements in our English Bible a subject for which important materials have been offered by
Jacobs	PERSON	,
Eadie	PERSON	, and Bishop
Westcott	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's work seems especially good in tracing organic developments , and in its stress of emphasis .

		It is absolutely free from any tinge of controversialism , the author going to the full limit of personal reticence .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's admir - able scholarship goes to the ultimate sources and lays them open remorselessly ; his extreme moderation of statement is one born of a mas - terful certainty of fact .

		He has a healthy Anglo-Saxon independence of tradition , and shows other traits which are a refreshing cor - rective to certain too-well-known qualities of German erudition .

		The 426 pages of this inviting work are a mas - terpiece of condensation .

		Its chief merit is its directness ; it is adequate , precise , unsparing , cumulative , and final ; it has a frank and fearless tone which does full honor to the exacting motto of its title-page : '' Nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice . ''

		There is a rare feeling for style , or rather -LRB- in a work which offers such a mass of translated docu - ments -RRB- for styles , which raises these difficult ver - sions to the plane of independent creations .

		To the above , we must add an appreciation of the author 's neat and admirably restrained wit .

		Professor
McGiffert	PERSON	's work is conceived in a broad and logical spirit , and written in a march - ing style which never fails to engage the interest of the reader .

		It is an excellent synthesis which makes Luther the embodiment of assurance in an age of doubt and fear ; certain of the author 's final explanations of events strike one as over - ingenious and subjective .

		There seems to be a somewhat timidous anxiety about giving offense to anybody .

		Being a work obviously designed '' not for the lerid bot for the lewed , '' it does not give sources or weigh authorities , but there are many signs that the solidest foundations lie hidden be - low the surface .

		The word translated '' injury '' on page 104 might better be rendered `` insult '' : Luther 's Bible gets something more than its dues as an original creation .

		The September-Testa - ment of
1522	DATE	is not a '' large '' folio -LRB- an almost perfect specimen of this first in the long line of Luther-Bibles , once belonging to Pastor Goeze of
Hamburg	LOCATION	, is one of the treasures of the New - berry Library in
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		How complete a Man this Luther is , as shown in these clear pages !

		Those who deny the effec - tual influence of any individual upon the course of events should study the life of Martin Luther : he has printed clearly and almost indelibly the stamp of his virile mind upon the vast popular thinking of all the ages since his day .

		In these times when the deepest motives have so largely lost their hold , how satisfying it is to enter into full communion with the inmost life of one to whom , in truth , Religion is the Chief Concern !

		Luther was large enough to value the humanities , but all other interests faded into littleness com - pared with his passionate hunger and thirst after righteousness .

		To this supreme loyalty of his faithful soul he was every hour prepared to offer up all other goods .

		Nor can we fail to note , as a part of his loyal nature , his intense German nationalism , the deep love for his own people , which has had such immense influence upon the development of that people into an independent , self-conscious nation .

		Luther , as shown so truly in the pages of these books , stands for all time as the champion of the integrity of personal conviction .

		He refused to be damned or brushed aside by any or all of those easy popular categories which classify men auto - matically , without inquiry into the grounds of individual action .

		On the heels of conviction came his ample speaking-out of the whole truth in the bluntest way , with homely proverbial vigor that hit the nail squarely on the head .

		If there be anything which corruption and pretence dreads , it is the naming of things by their right names ; and this was Luther 's clarifying service in an age of tyranny : he '' called '' the arrogance of a gigantic system of '' graft . ''

		Against all blandishments and threats he put up an iron resistance ; again and again in the very face of death he presented a front of absolute integrity .

		Little wonder that a task like this begot a life - and-death earnestness , that the dutiful monk soon made a thorough breach with humility , silence , and submission .

		And yet it is perhaps the chief note of Luther 's greatness that he did 530 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, not harden into narrow one-sidedness ; he hated sybarites , but affected no stoicism ; his earnest - ness is offset by a liberal share of the joy of liv - ing ; his forbearance is as deep as his polemic is intense ; his irresistible dry irony -LRB- as in the dedi - cation of his tract on Christian Liberty to Pope
Leo	PERSON	X. -RRB- by no means yields the palm to that of
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		If to our inadequately phrased tribute to this supremely great man we add that his life and in - fluence have their seamy side , we shall merely show some understanding of the ways of human development .

		Much of what he called in grandi - ose terms '' a tragedy of God and Satan '' shrinks to the dimensions of a rather sorry puppet-play , when set upon the stage of universal history .

		His perfervid Christianity made him unjust toward '' heathen '' culture -LRB- notably in his hatred of Aristotle -RRB- , and over-serious in his attitude to - ward the Fathers .

		His crass indecency of lan - guage , common to the age , is more pardonable than his vulgar concession : `` Our burning de - sires can not be restrained '' ; '' chastity is not in our power '' a begging of the whole question which has much to answer for in all later times .

		His crude superstition is very unlovely ; so is his narrow intolerance of religious variation , more particularly his pig-headed ugliness toward the good Zwingli .

		His occasional defence and practice of lying are not ingratiating , neither can we admire a faith which is ready to swallow '' dam - nable injustice and iniquity on God 's part . ''

		When we add that this rock of steadfastness on one or two occasions exhibited a humble and hu - miliating tergiversation , we say nothing worse than that our hero was made of true human stuff .

		The forever fatal and costly error of Luther lay in his easy substitution of an inerrant '' Word of God '' for infallible popes and councils .

		He broke with the latter because , as he bravely put it , '' they have often erred and contradicted them - selves , '' and his failure to apply the same test to the former is still an influence which works woe upon the thinking and living of millions who follow after .

		The ' ' plain text ' ' which ' ' can not be wrenched by argument '' had for him a fatal finality in paralyzing judgment and stultifying wisdom in the presence of the
Bible	LOCATION	, that ven - erable and perilous collection of scriptures .

		He accepted and based important arguments upon the most childlike biblical fables , and not merely in philosophical but also in ethical matters he was led by this method into deplorable by-ways . ''

		Let us not try to be better than
Abraham	PERSON	, '' is his sentence in discussing wedlock .

		One al - most weeps in thinking of the working-time which Luther spent in seriously arguing the binding authority of the saying , '' Thou art
Peter	PERSON	. ''

		He took the Scriptures as a unit , and a simple '' God said '' was the end of reasoning .

		Even the fixed lodestar of Luther 's complete theological system , '' The just shall live by faith , '' derives from that minimal member of the whole guild of minor pro- phets ,
Habakkuk	LOCATION	.

		The worst flaw in Luther 's integrity lies in the fact that he joined to this servile bibliolatry a twisting of Scripture-texts , which stultified his attacks upon Catholic prac - tices , and a fierce higher criticism which dis - counted even the
Fourth Commandment	ORGANIZATION	.

		He debased the currency of mind by a desperate attempt violently to reconcile obvious verbal statements with modern ethical demands . ''

		We must not trifle with the articles of faith so long and unanimously held by
Christendom	LOCATION	, '' he ex - claims ; but this canon proved itself sadly un - helpful when he applied it against the New Astronomy , for example .

		`` I was instructed , '' writes Luther in telling of his interview with Cardinal
Cajetan	PERSON	near the beginning of his public career , '' that to teach the truth is the same as to disturb the Church . ''

		The Cardinal was right ; and the burning ques - tion remains , whether , after all , such an upheaval is worth the cost .

		Must the consolations of relig - ion be guarded by ignoring truth ?

		Smug or timid souls who identify their fixed Christianities with absolute virtue and the stability of the social framework , will answer that new unblended light must be ruinous to weak human eyes .

		Luther sublimely staked all values upon the cause of unqualified truth , and the violence and horrors which followed his protest were not too high a price .

		Instead of wrecking the imagined pillars which prop up a pretended shallow and solid firmament , he disclosed starry heavens of infinite depth and glory , whose radiant orbs swing and sing in pure spaces , far remote from man 's offi - cious solicitudes as to their upholding .

		If a '' protestant '' be by historical derivation one who resists the fettering of the human mind and the shutting of those doors of freedom which lead to an expansion of the rigid Faith of Our Fathers , and to a going on toward a better phil - osophy and religion , let every true man glory in this name .

		Let us bear in mind , above all , that it is not the final value of Luther 's doctrines which makes us forever his debtors , but the heartening exam pie which he sets of that supreme courage which dares to challenge , heartily and full of a higher faith , '' the deliberate , ancient , almost universal opinion of mankind .

		THE DIAL 531 `` THE SEASONS '' OF A IjATER
THOMSON	ORGANIZATION	.

		* To the professional biologist , very little of the output of the professional '' nature '' writer is of any particular interest .

		This is in part due to a perfectly natural and human desire on the biologist 's part to take his fiction and his science each neat .

		But more particularly it is due to the fact that generally the '' nature '' writer only deals with those aspects of living things which the biologist knows to be , on the whole , the least interesting .

		Wonderful as the pageant of the living world is in all its myriad charms of color , form , birth , and growth , it is only as we seek , and in some measure find , the meaning of it all , the guiding principles which underlie it , that real interest takes the place of kaleidoscopic wonderment .

		Here is where much '' nature - writing '' and `` nature-study '' fail .

		Only once in a very great while will the philosophic insight of the trained biologist be found coupled in one person with the freshness of vision , naive sym - pathy and literary skill of the artist .

		That such a combination , if rare , is still possible , is evidenced by Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	's '' Biology of the Seasons . ''

		The popular writings of its author on biological sub - jects have for a long time occupied a leading place among works of this class in the English language .

		But the present book , considered as a piece of literature , quite overshadows in ex - cellence all of his earlier work .

		Writing in the preface of what a biological account of the sea - sonal pageant should be , he says : '' The ideal would be to study the organismal drama of the year with the sympathetic feeling of the old nat - uralists , such as
Gilbert White	PERSON	, with
Darwin	PERSON	's dominant sense of correlation and evolution , and with
Spencer	PERSON	's grasp of the
Unity of Science	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		He modestly disclaims having got very far on toward this high and right ideal , but actually the book measurably approaches it . ''

		The Biology of the Seasons '' is not a nat - uralist 's diary or commonplace book .

		It does not attempt to catalogue the doings of the liv - ing things at any particular spot throughout the year .

		On the contrary it is a delightful series of essays on evolution , for which the varying events and the changing population of the seasons furnish the texts . ''

		Caterpillars , '' '' Spring Flowers , '' '' The Courtship of Birds , '' `` The Ephemerides , '' `` The Palolo-worm , '' `` The White Winter Coat , '' all these , and many other matters , are so dealt with as to bring out clearly * THB BIOLOGY OF THE SEASONS .

		their relation to , and exemplification of , general principles of evolutionary biology .

		This is done in the least didactic of ways ; indeed , many a casual reader will pursue his interested way to the last page without ever realizing that this is one of the best books on Evolution that has yet been written , just as a teacher whom I know regularly puts his elementary classes through nearly the whole of the differential calculus with - out ever mentioning that dread name , or other - wise letting the students know how basely they are being imposed upon .

		Only a great teacher can do this , whether the subject be biology or mathematics .

		Each of the four parts is opened with an '' impressionistic sketch '' of the season with which the part has to do .

		Spring is the time of new things ; Summer the time when the `` fires of life burn brightest '' ; Autumn is the `` year 's curfew and its vespers '' ; and
Winter	DATE	the time of sleep and death .

		These characterizations are '' clever , and show literary skill as well as ph ilo sophic grasp .

		Thus it is said of Spring : '' It is the time of giving birth to new lives .

		It is the time when new lives , begun long since , indeed begin to be .

		In all these young lives there is what is new ; no one of them is quite like its parents , but each carries with it the promise of better or worse ; in the phrase of the biologists , this is the time of variations .

		It may be , indeed , that the newness is simply that what was of evil in the parents has been forgiven in their children , which is cause for rejoicing ; but sometimes it is that the little child be it human or water-baby really leads the race , as was said long ago .

		It may be , of course there 's the rub that the promise is never fulfilled , for the playful lamb which we all so much admire grows into a very stolid sheep , -LRB- man has such a way of making young things stupid -RRB- ; the very active-minded chick becomes a most matter-of-fact hen ; the ` promising ' young anthropoid becomes a careworn , abruti , and rather cross-grained , elderly ape .

		Need we point the moral ?

		The fact at once hopeful and tragic is that the young life is often ahead of its race .

		If the promise be fulfilled , then the world makes progress , and that is Spring . ''

		Again , after characterizing
Winter	DATE	as the sea - son of death and elimination by natural selection , the discussion is turned to races which have be - come extinct in the history of the world .

		The conclusion is : '' Thus from the elimination now observable around us in this wintry season our thoughts naturally pass to the great world-wide process , continuous since life began , which embraces us also in its inexorable sifting .

		It does not , indeed , explain us , nor the organisms we know , any more than the pruning-hook explains the tree ; but given life and growth , we can not understand our history or that of living creatures apart from elimination .

		In short we need our
Winter	DATE	to explain
Summer	DATE	, and this perhaps is the only consolation which the biologist can suggest to the discontented , that the alternation of
Summer	DATE	and 532 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Winter	ORGANIZATION	is part of the mechanism which has made the history of the world a progressive development . ''

		The limitations to quoting from the book are imposed by the space to be had in a review , and not by availability of material .

		The book is ornamented , though not illustrated as is stated on the title-page to be the case , by twelve color prints from paintings by
William Smith	PERSON	, some of which are excellent .

		The book is adequately indexed .

		It is a notable contribution to the liter - ature of living Nature .

		Its place on the book - shelf is between `` The Natural History of

Thoreau	PERSON	's `` Walden , '' on the one side , and '' The Origin of Species '' on the other side .

		The very aroma of the Orient exhales from the pages of Professor
A. V. Williams Jackson	PERSON	's fine volume , `` From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayy & m : Travels in
Transcaucasia	LOCATION	and
Northern Persia	LOCATION	for Historic and Literary Research '' -LRB- Mac - niillan -RRB- .

		The cordial reception given to his ``
Persia	LOCATION	, Past and Present '' has encouraged the author , he says , '' to describe the first half of two subse - quent journeys made through northern
Iran	LOCATION	, Trans - caspia , and
Turkistan	ORGANIZATION	in
1907	DATE	and
1908	DATE	for the pur - pose of scholarly research . ''

		The present volume describes the journey along the Black Sea and into Russian
Asia	LOCATION	; a companion volume , to appear later , will cover the territory traversed beyond the Caspian and into the heart of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Nothing is either too ancient or too modern to engage the attention of the learned traveller .

		Oil-wells and pre-historic ruins are alike , though in varying degrees , objects of in - terest to him .

		More than two hundred illustrations from photographs besprinkle the book , which has also a beautiful colored frontispiece view of the tomb of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	and a folding map , with occa - sional smaller charts and an index .

		The handsome cover design repeats the frontispiece , which is again reproduced on the wrapper .

		Decidedly , the book is intended to perpetuate the memory of him who lies buried near
Nishapur	LOCATION	.

		What the French have accomplished in making a considerable portion of northern
Africa	LOCATION	a desirable region for motor-tourists , and how much is still left in its primitive condition , may be agreeably learned from Mrs.
Emma Burbank Ayer	PERSON	's volume of travel sketches , `` A Motor Flight through
Algeria	LOCATION	and
Tunisia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Her husband accompanied her , and an expert chauffeur ran the car .

		Of course a camera two , in fact formed an indispensable part of their luggage , and the writer also claimed as a portion of her equipment `` perfect health , boundless enthusiasm , and a modest knowledge of French . ''

		Four hundred and more pages of travel incident and description , of dialogue and various sorts of toward and untoward happenings , all most copiously illus - trated with views taken on the way and exhibiting both the nature of the country , its buildings , its flocks and fields , and its inhabitants , furnish the reader with entertainment for more than one evening , and with not a few bits of new knowledge ; for it was no main travelled road that these tourists chose in invad - ing
Africa	LOCATION	with their petroleum car .

		Nevertheless , the roads travelled by them were found to be surpris - ingly good , extending to all parts of both hill country and plain .

		The volume is indexed , provided with a map , and decoratively bound in neat and serviceable buckram .

		Having described in a former work the chief cities of
Umbria	LOCATION	, Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	now invites our sympathetic interest in those of
Venetia	LOCATION	, chief among which , of course , is the Bride of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	.

		More than half of his book , in fact , on ``
Venice	LOCATION	and

Venice	LOCATION	, whose art and architecture , legends and traditions , might easily have monopolized the entire volume .

		But
Treviso	LOCATION	and
Bassano	PERSON	,
Padua	LOCATION	and
Vicenza	LOCATION	and
Verona	LOCATION	, and other places of interest , are visited in turn and made to yield their portion of story and description for the reader 's entertainment .

		One of the closing chapters , entitled '' Two Poets and the
Euganean Hills	LOCATION	, '' has to do chiefly with
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		The writer 's love of and admiration for
Italy	LOCATION	speak in all his pages , and especially at the end of the book , where he does not hesitate to refer to her people as having '' created and preserved

		The tone of the book is frankly topographi - cal , an effect which is confirmed by the excellent maps which it contains .

		There are also forty-seven illustrations , from drawings by Mr.
Arthur Tucker	PERSON	, R.B.A. , giving interesting views of various scenes and localities included in the volume .

		There is also a concordance of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's references to persons and places pictured or described .

		Two long and in - teresting letters are here published for the firsttime one from Words worth to LordLonsdale , and another from

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		The latest addition to '' The Connoisseurs ' Li - brary '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a scholarly treatise on '' Illumi - nated Manuscripts , '' by Mr.
J. A. Herbert	PERSON	of the British Museum .

		It is the fruit of minute and painstaking investigation that has extended to the examination of all the important manuscripts in pub - lic and private collections in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and the voluminous literature that has grown up about them .

		The history of the illumination of vel - lum manuscripts is traced `` from classical times down to the decay and virtual disuse of the art which re - sulted inevitably , though not immediately , from the introduction of printing . ''

		So far as existing mate - rials allow , the development of the various styles has been followed out , though the scantiness of these materials for some sections and periods made the task a hard one .

		Of especial service to students of illumination for whose guidance the book has been written are the detailed accounts of Classical ,
Early Christian	ORGANIZATION	,
Byzantine	LOCATION	, and other rare and little-known early manuscripts , most of which are difficult of ac - cess , and yet , as the author puts it , `` have vital sig - nificance as marking stages in the development of the art . ''

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	's point of view is that of the archaeologist and historian rather than that of the connoisseur and art critic .

		For example , in what he has to say about Byzantinism he is less concerned with the quality of its art than with the fact that it was the conserving force that kept the traditional composition of sacred themes intact for centuries ; and he notes that early in
the first half of the sixth century	DATE	the iconography of scenes in the life of Christ had become settled into fixed conventions .

		The re - lations between the different styles and the influences under which the artists worked have been kept con - stantly in mind in .

		writing the long series of descrip - tions of manuscripts that make up the volume .

		Only in one instance does a probable source of inspiration appear to have been overlooked .

		The
Simeon Meta	PERSON	- phrastes manuscript in the British Museum , says Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	, '' irresistibly reminds everyone who sees it for the first time of some Oriental pattern-work and especially of Persian carpets or enamels . ''

		Strangely enough , Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	does not perceive the resem - blance to contemporary Persian manuscripts .

		The chapters upon the later history of illumination are most comprehensive , though in dealing with periods when the material is superabundant the descriptions have necessarily been limited to manuscripts of un - usual merit .

		Of technical information , the book contains virtually none .

		The reader who wishes to know what pigments were used , and how they were prepared and applied , must look elsewhere .

		Seldom is there any information given as to the size of the manuscripts described .

		The illustrations consist of fifty-one plates ; one in color , the others in collo - type .

		The subjects have been selected with excellent judgment , and the reproductions , though small in scale , are sharp and clear .

		There are ample indices and a select bibliography of works that the author has found useful .

		Mr.
G. Griffin Lewis	PERSON	's `` Practical Book of Oriental Rugs '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- does not belie its title .

		From cover to cover it is packed with detailed information compactly and conveniently arranged for ready refer - ence .

		Many people who are interested in the beau - tiful fabrics of which the author treats , but have not the time or the opportunity to acquire the intimate knowledge of the rug expert , have long wished for such a book as this , and will be grateful to Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	for writing it .

		The work is divided into two parts .

		In the first are set forth with painstaking care such things as the characteristics of the different weaves , the materials used and the differences between them , the considerations that determine value , tests of age and quality , and how the intending buyer should ex - amine rugs .

		There is a serviceable chapter on the best methods of taking care of rugs , and an elaborate presentation in an alphabetical list , with brief descrip - tions and suggestive drawings , of the different designs used by the Oriental weavers , and also an attempt 534 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, to give the symbolic meaning of each pattern .

		In this the author treads upon debatable ground ; but as he is not writing for students of mythology , there is little need to examine all of his statements closely .

		Of real worth is the chapter upon the identification of rugs .

		The salient points of the better-known weaves are named in the order of their importance for the purpose of assisting the student in differentiating ; and in an admirably arranged table the distinguish - ing features of all rugs are shown .

		Especially useful are the descriptions , with accompanying illustrations , of the backs of all the rugs that have a distinctive weave .

		As every experienced person knows , the ex - pert gets a considerable part of his information from the backs of rugs , and the inclusion of data upon this detail is essential to a comprehensive treatment of the subject .

		The second part of the book is devoted to descriptions of the rugs made in different localities .

		The student will find in these descriptions just the things he needs to know .

		Of course no book can supply all that is necessary to complete knowledge ; that can come only through actual handling of a large number of the rugs themselves under reliable guid - ance .

		But Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	has probably come as near as anyone can to ward furnishing an efficient printed aid .

		The illustrations , as well as the text , are of practical value .

		Ten of them are in color .

		For the most part the rugs reproduced are not rare museum pieces , but ordinarily fine examples such as can with care and knowledge be bought to-day in the open market .

		In spacious quarto form , with innumerable care - ful reproductions , colored and plain , '' Portraits of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, from
Giotto	LOCATION	to Raff ael , '' by Professor
Richard Thayer Holbrook	PERSON	, is imported by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work , as announced on its title-page , is `` a critical study , with concise iconography , '' and must have involved years of devoted labor and a high order of connoisseurship in Italian art and its history .

		The
Dante	ORGANIZATION	portraits held in highest re - pute have been reduced to a common scale and dis - played in twos or threes , the better to enable the reader to compare them and to determine , as far as may be , whether they are original and authentic likenesses , or mere copies or adaptations .

		Of course the
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	profile of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, the familiar eyeless portrait , engages our chief interest ; and Professor
Holbrook	PERSON	's account of its recovery in
1840	DATE	, of the leading part played by an American art lover in accomplishing this recovery , of the accident that explains the loss of the eye in the likeness , and of much else connected with the famous portrait , forms an important and very readable section of the book .

		Supplementing the twenty-one chapters '' from Giotto to Raffael , '' comes appended matter of importance , including an elaborate descriptive cata - logue of more than a hundred notable Dante like - nesses not discussed in the body of the work , and a careful bibliography .

		A full index completes the volume .

		The appearance of so important a con - tribution to the study of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is an event of no small moment , and Professor
Holbrook	PERSON	has made all Dante students his debtors .

		The year 146 B. C. , when
Corinth	LOCATION	was taken by Mummius and its accumulated art treasures either destroyed or carried to
Rome	LOCATION	, is adopted by Mr.
H. B. Walters	PERSON	in his elaborate work on '' The Art of the Romans '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as the natural point of division between Greek and Roman art .

		A former work by Mr.
Walters	PERSON	has already traced the history of Greek art down to the subjugation of
Greece	LOCATION	by
Rome	LOCATION	, so that the present treatise forms a fitting se - quel to that , and assumes in the reader a general knowledge of its contents .

		Beginning with a brief survey of early Roman art and its origins in
Etruria	LOCATION	, the author then takes up Roman architecture , Roman sculpture -LRB- under Augustus and later -RRB- , Roman paint - ing and mosaic , gem-engraving and metal-work , pot - tery and terra-cotta , and , finally , Roman art in the provinces .

		A brief chronological table and an index are added .

		The full-page plates , seventy-two in num - ber , are from photographs .

		Twelve smaller illus - trations are given in the text .

		The large-octavo size of the book is turned to good account by the illustrator , and in other respects the work is con - ceived and executed on a generous scale .

		The French , asserts Mr.
Charles H. Cafh	PERSON	` n , the eminent art critic and art historian , '' have been the only race since the Italians of the
Renaisance	PERSON	and the Greeks of antiquity to whom art in its various forms is a natural and inevitable expression of what is for the time being their attitude toward life . ''

		Appropriately , therefore , he seeks , in his `` Story of French Painting '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to correlate the growth of that painting '' with the changes in the social and political life of the nation and with the manifestations of the esprit gaulois in other departments of intellectual and artistic activity , particularly in that of literature . ''

		A some - what ambitious undertaking , this , for a brief popular survey of French art ; but within the limit of its two hundred and a score pages , divided chronolog - ically into twenty chapters , the book renders excel - lent service to the art-loving reader interested in the general and more largely significant aspects of a nation 's art .

		Numerous process-print illustrations , contending as best they can against the difficulties of reproducing in black and white the general fea - tures of paintings , are supplied as called for by the text ; and a full index closes the volume , which in style and compass resembles the same author 's '' Story of Dutch Painting '' and '' Story of Spanish Painting . ''

		The arts and crafts of the many peoples composing the Empire of
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	are certainly not lacking in variety , nor do they fall short in technical excellence . ''

		No fewer than seventeen nationalities enter into the composition of

		THE DIAL 535 and Roumanians .

		Hungary presents greater homo - geneity , but even here we have Saxons and other races as well as Magyars .

		Consequently , in the embroid - ery , bead-work , lace-making , wood-carving , pottery , rug - weaving , and other domestic arts and crafts pro- secuted by the peasantry , one finds rich material for study .

		Different writers and specialists contribute to the descriptive chapters accompanying the various pictured specimens of this peasant art .

		Colored re - productions serve well to convey an idea of the pic - turesque folk-costumes , and of the bright beauty of the textile manufactures of the people , and of their embroideries and certain other sorts of decorative work .

		The volume is issued in paper covers , which many purchasers will be glad to replace with a taste - ful binding in harmony with the book 's contents .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF OLD FAVORITES .

		Sympathetic interpretation of White 's ''
Selborne	LOCATION	'' speaks in the numerous admirable colored drawings , by Mr.
George Edward Collins	PERSON	, that greet one in a handsome and generously-dimensioned edition of the classic work now offered by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	and Antiquities of
Selborne	LOCATION	in
the County of Southampton	LOCATION	'' has surely never found itself more worthily published than in this latest re-issue .

		A distant view of the little village where
Gilbert White	PERSON	lived is given in the frontispiece , and a near prospect of its main street in a later pic - ture , while skilful representations of birds and their haunts , and of other natural objects , are of frequent occurrence .

		The quaintness and quietness of old Sel - borne could hardly have been better pictured than by Mr.
Collins	PERSON	.

		The fair , broad pages of the book and the wide margins are a delight to the eye , and this amplitude of dimension contributes no little to the satisf actoriness of the full-page plates .

		A striking contrast we have here to the earlier issues of this mod - est work from the pen of an obscure country parson .

		The great popularity of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's '' Life of Nel - son '' is attested by the forty entries of the book , in various editions , in the British Museum catalogue .

		At least fifty-seven printings of the book have been traced in
England	LOCATION	, and its republication in other countries has been extensive .

		Emphatically it is the life of the famous hero , and Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	does well to edit this year a fine new issue of the biog - raphy , illustrated in color by Mr.
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	, the eminent artist , who has himself been made the subject of a notable book of the season .

		His seven large colored plates illustrating events in
Nelson	LOCATION	's life are strikingly original in character .

		A colored portrait of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, after
Singleton	PERSON	, appears as front - ispiece and also on the cover .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's Introduction to the '' Life '' presents briefly a few important and interesting facts concerning its author , its subject , and the book itself .

		It is an added pleas - ure to read this well-tested work in so sumptuous a form .

		A timely new edition of
John Forster	PERSON	's '' Life of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, '' with five hundred portraits , facsimiles , and other illustrations , all `` collected , arranged , and annotated '' by Mr.
B. W. Matz	PERSON	, is imported by
the Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An interesting preface by the editor explains his reason for refrain - ing from adding any of the abundant later material with which a centenary edition of this famous
Dick	PERSON	- ens biography might easily be enlarged .

		The sur - viving members of the family wished the original work to remain untouched .

		But the numerous and well-chosen illustrations make the book a new one even to those who have read it before .

		The text is that of
Forster	PERSON	's revised two-volume edition , and is here also divided into two substantial octavos .

		The most elaborate and splendidly ornate presen - tation of
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Princess '' that the season has witnessed and there have been at least three such appearances is that which enjoys the prestige of Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	's name as illustrator , with the
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	as publishers .

		Large quarto in form , the book shows innumerable examples of Mr.
Christy	PERSON	's well-known art , emphasis being placed , not unfittingly , on the female figures of the metrical story .

		The full-page plates glow with a veri - tably barbaric wealth of color , the marginal and other illustrations being in pen-and-ink with but occasional slight dashes of red .

		Three cover-designs for book , box , and wrapper vie with one another in richness .

		Not even an East-Indian princess could desire more gorgeous trappings .

		The reading public 's early and rather persistent obtuseness to the merits of ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' has long since been generously atoned for ; and still the pay - ing of this deferred debt to genius is going on , each
Christmas	LOCATION	season being pretty sure to bring forth a new edition , or at least a new printing , of the ad - mirable Exmoor romance .

		The American publishers who , twenty-one years ago , played the part of '' fair knights of the order of Copyright '' and took
Lorna	PERSON	under their chivalrous protection , put forth this year a very attractive edition of the novel in two small volumes , illustrated with excellent views from the region where the scene of the story is laid , and neatly boxed .


Blackmore	PERSON	's preface to the authorized '' Exmoor '' edition of
1890	DATE	is given in autograph , and also in print .

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's Sons . -RRB-

		A few years ago there came from the genius of a woman who hid her identity under the pen-name of ''
Michael Fairless	PERSON	'' a book of intimate reflection , '' The Road-Mender , '' which was at once welcomed by an appreciative , if limited , group of readers .

		Since then , the unique quality of the book , its broad but calm outlook , combining a knowledge of the world with a will to do without much of what the world holds desirable or indispensable , has commended it to an ever-widening circle .

		This season brings forth a new edition from
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in a form which aims to be worthy of the work .

		Col - ored illustrations by Mr.
E. W. Waite	PERSON	bring to the eye the veritable roads on which the road-mender plied his trade while he reflected on the issues of life , and show us the cottage where he had his '' luxuries of life , '' to wit , '' a truckle bed , table , chair , and hugh earthenware pan . ''

		Large type and wide margins 536 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, add the finishing touch of utility as well as of beauty to this volume .

		Who but the Chaucer specialist ever reads '' The Romaunt of the Rose '' in these days of hurry and worry and strenuous activity ?

		Fragment though it is , the length of this beautiful version of an old French original repels many who can get through one or two of the '' Canterbury Tales '' very comfortably .

		Per - haps with the pleasing colored illustrations provided by Mr.
Keith Henderson	PERSON	and Mr.
Norman Wilkin	PERSON	- son , in a fine edition published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, even the unpersistent reader may be be - guiled into a perusal of the poem from beginning to end .

		Twenty of these art creations , in plates of quarto size , adorn the book .

		A glossary is appended .

		The eight-syllable verse admits of two columns on a page , in large type .

		No handsomer edition of the '' Romaunt , '' it is safe to say , has ever been issued .

		The beauty and the fitness of Mr.
Frederick Simp	PERSON	- son
Coburn	PERSON	's illustrations , both colored and plain , to the new Putnam edition of '' The Chimes '' fullv justify this presentation of
Dickens	PERSON	's famous story in a fresh dress to mark the recurrence of the season it commemorates .

		In this artist 's handling the familiar
Dickens	PERSON	characters are freed from the grotesqueries and other more or less discordant peculiarities that have so often marked the illustrator 's conceptions of the creatures of the great novelist 's imagination .

		Wholly human and ingratiating , as they should be , are the
Trotty Veck	ORGANIZATION	and the
Meg	PERSON	and
Richard	PERSON	, and the other old favorites delineated by Mr.
Coburn	PERSON	's brush and pencil .

		Marginal decorations , a gilt and colored cover-design , and full gilt edges are also among the attractions of this tasteful gift-book .

		There is an alliterative attraction in the very title of `` The Pocket Parkman '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that accords well with the beauty and the desirability of the twelve small and thin flexibly-bound vol - umes in which the historian 's admirable series is now presented .

		The typography is of the excellence already familiar to
Parkman	PERSON	's readers , the thin paper is perfectly opaque , and the limp morocco , stamped with a graceful design , is all that could be desired in the binding for a pocket volume .

		The new dress will attract new readers , and will tempt to a re-reading on the part of old ones .

		Clear , open print and some well-drawn illustra - tions , with handsome binding and gilt top , contribute to the desirability of the handy and inexpensive edi - tion of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	'' offered this year by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bright coloring of Mr.
H. M. Brock	PERSON	's pictures give them a festive appearance not unwelcome to some , and cer - tainly much in vogue at present .

		In this instance , be it said , the appeal to the eye is not made often enough to distract attention from the ever-fresh and ever-fascinating story of the fortunes of the Prim - rose family .

		Tennyson 's '' Princess '' gives ample opportunity to the artist for the conception of striking and somewhat unusual effects in book-illustration .

		Mr.
Everard Hopkins	PERSON	has seized this opportunity in his vivid and appropriate colored pictures to the edition issued by
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The brilliant hues he so lavishly uses are not exactly those of real life ; but neither are the actions of the Princess and her com - panions .

		Smaller line drawings also accompany the text , which is beautifully printed on broad pages with wide margins .

		The cover-design is excellent .

		HOLIDAY FICTION .

		Admirers of Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	will welcome the holiday edition of his new story , `` The Money Moon '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As
Small Porges	PERSON	, '' who breathes the ideal spirit of childhood explains to his adopted uncle ,
George Bellew	PERSON	, a recently jilted American millionaire , the Money Moon is the par - ticular kind of moon which shines when one goes forth to seek a fortune and finds it .

		In this case there is more than a fortune in money involved , for
George Bellew	PERSON	is adopted by
Porges	PERSON	just at the right time to enable him to save his nephew 's Aunt
Anthea	PERSON	from the clutches of a villain of the good old roman - tically villainous type .

		All these characters , and the beautiful English country in which their romance is played , are , in this edition , pictured in faithful colors , by Mr.
A. I. Keller	PERSON	, who has fully achieved collabo - ration with the author by the happiness of his ren - derings .

		The story is less elaborate and more closely knit than the author 's previous volume , '' The Broad Highway , '' and will have an even wider appeal .

		A tale of love , with just enough of roughness in the running of its course to prove it indubitably true love , makes the sort of reading that all the world is craving every day in the year , and not least of all at this particular season of the year .

		Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	's ''
Joyce	PERSON	of the Jasmines '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- is just the story to relieve , temporarily , that hungry feeling .

		The book is given a holiday appear - ance by the excellent colored illustrations supplied by Mr.
Clarence F. Underwood	PERSON	, who does justice to the heroine 's charm and to the hero 's prepossessing qualities .

		Marginal decorations , more varied and unconventional than are often met with , are con - tributed by Mr.
Edward Stratton Holloway	PERSON	.

		The large , clear type -LRB- that of our early reading-books at school -RRB- would almost cure eye-strain .

		After passing well beyond the hundred-thousand mark without the adventitious aid of colored pictures or decorative page-borders , '' The Mistress of Shen - stone '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- now comes forth thus adorned to make fresh conquests .

		The eight full-page plates by Mr.
F. H. Townsend	PERSON	make vivid to the eye of sense those momentous situations which Mrs.
Barclay	PERSON	's pen has caused to appeal so forcibly to the popular imagination ; and the cover-design and other decora - tions of Miss
Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	's designing are pleasing and harmonious .

		An ornamented box en - closes this elaborate re-issue of Mrs.
Barclay	PERSON	's second - greatest success in romantic fiction .

		A brave and loyal army officer , too poor to feel that he can honorably ask any woman to be his wife , and a charmingly wilful young widow , who unhesi - tatingly spends her entire fortune of nearly twelve

Warner	ORGANIZATION	's romance , `` When Woman Proposes . ''

		It is all delightfully possible and just as delightfully improbable exactly the satisfying sort of love - story to fit the festive season .

		But further words of praise for anything from the pen that wrote `` The Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary '' and the im - agination that created ''
Susan Clegg	PERSON	'' are unne - cessary .

		Colored drawings are provided by Miss
Charlotte Weber Ditzler	PERSON	, and tasteful decorations by Mr.
Theodore B. Hapgood	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- '' The Mahatma and the Hare '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.
H. Rider Haggard	PERSON	, gives in a most appealing and realistic form the timid hare 's views of the time - honored sport of animal-killing and animal-torture as indulged in by our British cousins .

		It is a '' dream-story , '' as the title-page explains , and as the narrative itself makes clear ; but it is none the less convincing for that , and may deservedly be accorded a place beside '' Black Beauty '' and similar animal stories with a humanitarian motive .

		Excel - lent line drawings , to the number of twelve , help to give vividness to the hare 's piteous tale .

		In festive dress , with spirited illustrations in color by Mr.
George W. Gage	PERSON	, and decorations by Mr.
Edward Stratton Holloway	PERSON	, `` An Accidental Honey - moon , '' by Mr.
David Potter	PERSON	, makes its enlivening appearance at this holiday season .

		A hero , a heroine , and a sailing yacht , with sundry complications and at last a happy ending , go to make up a tale of love that few fiction-readers could begin without wishing to continue to the end ; and the publishers have done their part to make this continuing highly agreeable .

		The book has an ornamented cover and a slide case .

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		Mr.
Edward Legge	PERSON	, the biographer of the Em - press
Eugenie	PERSON	, has produced a companion volume on '' The Comedy and Tragedy of the Second Empire '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , in which , he announces in his preface , '' I have endeavored to portray some aspects of the Court and of
Paris Society	ORGANIZATION	between
1852	DATE	and
1870	DATE	, '' the earlier work having chiefly to do with '' the lives of the Imperial Family in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Some space , however , is now devoted to the early life of both Emperor and
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, to their first acquaintance with each other and their engagement , and to other details leading up to the important period especially covered by the book .

		Accuracy the writer pro- fesses to have striven for throughout , but he has also remained throughout a cordial admirer of the '' Pale Emperor '' as well as of his beautiful Spanish con - sort .

		Facilities for acquainting himself with the Emperor 's personal traits seem not to have been lack - ing to him , and his chapters have an air of author - ity , of command of their theme , that greatly makes for their readability .

		A number of rather impor - tant letters too are inserted that throw light on the matter in hand .

		Portraits and other illustrations are supplied in abundance , and the typography is of the best .

		So well received was Mr.
Henry S. Pancoast	PERSON	's '' Standard English Poems '' that he has felt encour - aged to adapt his compilation to the wider demand of poetry-lovers in general , the earlier work having been meant for school and college use .

		Accordingly '' The Vista of English Verse '' makes its appearance from the same publishing house -LRB- Holt -RRB- , with the trail of the schoolmaster obliterated , the notes omitted , the form of the book rendered more artistic , and the Victorian section enlarged by the insertion of several poems by recent and living writers .

		From early ballad verse to Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	's `` Call of the Spring '' and `` Unity , '' the volume includes a generous selection from all that is best in English poetry down to our own time .

		Excellent print , thin but opaque paper , full gilt edges , and a flexible cover in green and gilt , are the material features of this compact little volume of more than six hundred pages one of the best gift-books of verse that the season has produced .

		Both the head and the heart must give assent to the excellent arguments advanced in '' The Feast of
St. Friend	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, for the con - tinued observance of Christmas .

		A decline of the Christmas spirit is noted by him -LRB- though perhaps if he observes the frightful crush of Christmas shop - pers in our cities at this season he will change his mind -RRB- , and he writes to revive the good old customs of Yuletide .

		To make these customs something more than formal , however , he would have us throughout the year cultivate a spirit of friendship , a sympa - thetic interest in those about us , that shall make the annual festival a natural and spontaneous expression of our good-will .

		Although , to the pessimist in us all , to breathe is to suffer , and to think is to mourn , and he alone is blest who ne'er was born , yet the opposite view of life has kept the world going for countless centuries andwill keep it going for countless more ; and the sane optimism and human kindliness of such books as '' The Feast of St. Friend '' will aid the forward movement .

Eli Terry	PERSON	and
Seth Thomas	PERSON	and
Silas Hoadley	PERSON	, with many an - other early horologer , received from Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	the honor due to their inventiveness and skill .

		Not un - naturally the
State	ORGANIZATION	associated -LRB- however unjustly -RRB- with the manufacture of wooden nutmegs is found to have led the way in American clock-making , the above-named clock-makers being all
Connecticut	LOCATION	men .

		538 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Careful lists of English and American clock-makers , with an index to the book 's contents , follow the read - ing matter , and more than a hundred illustrations are inserted .

		The book has distinction in its cover - design and its agreeably-tinted paper .

		The glamour that surrounds a throne , in the eyes of those not compelled by a cruel destiny to sit there - on , will secure many eager readers for Mr.
Kellogg Durland	PERSON	's `` Royal Romances of To-day '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Commissioned by a popular monthly to write a series of articles on the Empress of
Russia	LOCATION	, the Queen of
Italy	LOCATION	, and the Queen of
Spain	LOCATION	, Mr.
Durland	PERSON	took pains to make these portraits of royalty as pleasing to the eye as was compatible with fidelity to the truth so far as he could ascertain it by personal inquiry .

		He visited
Russia	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	for the express pur - pose of preparing these chapters on their respective queens , which are now gathered into a substantial volume , well illustrated , and in every way attractive to the general reader .

		Intimate details of family life , and an occasional glimpse of the family skeleton , make the narrative very real and human ; and its general trustworthiness is sufficient for its purpose .

		The book is among the most entertaining of its kind .

		An unusual and pathetic interest attaches to Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	's latest long poem , a love - story entitled `` When She was About Sixteen , '' lavishly and appropriately illustrated , with a sparing use of tint , by Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	.

		The author , it is feared , will hardly be able to use his pen again , paralysis of the arm having overtaken him ; and as he declares his inability to compose otherwise than with pen in hand , this is likely to prove his last contribution to poetry .

		This metrical tale of love is , in form , a small boy 's rehearsal of his uncle 's account of how the small boy 's father wooed and won the girl of sweet sixteen who in due time became the small boy 's mother .

		It is all in boy dialect , and hinges largely on a stern parent 's determination that his daughter shall not marry the man of her choice .

		But love can find a way , and so all ends happily .

		The book , quarto in form , is ornate in the extreme , without and within , and is attractively boxed .

		-LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	has chosen a taking title for his collection of eighteenth-century studies , '' Some Eccentrics and a Woman , '' imported by
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The woman in question -LRB- we give her first place , though the author does not -RRB- is Mrs.
Elizabeth Draper	PERSON	, the young , charming , and unhappily-married lady who is better known as ''
Sterne	PERSON	's Eliza , '' and whose celebrity under that designation her admirer hoped to make wider than that of even Swift 's Stella or
Waller	PERSON	's Sacharissa .

		A Platonic love Mr.
Mel	PERSON	- ville believes this sentiment of
Sterne	PERSON	's to have been , and his sketch of Mrs.
Draper	PERSON	's life , largely from unpublished letters now first drawn upon to any ex - tent , is unobjectionable in character .

		Other chapters in this necessarily personal and somewhat gossipy volume treat of the boon companions of him who afterward became
King George the Fourth	ORGANIZATION	, of some dandies of the Regency , of Dr.
John Wolcot	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Peter Pindar	PERSON	'' -RRB- , of the `` Demoniacs , '' of the author of '' Vathek , '' of the brilliant
Charles James Fox	PERSON	, and of the versatile
Philip	LOCATION	, Duke of
Wharton	LOCATION	good reading a-plenty for admirers of the later eighteenth century , and well illustrated with portraits .

		Scarcely four months have passed since the la - mented death , in the young prime of her years , of Mrs.
Myrtle Reed McCullough	PERSON	; yet already a careful hand has compiled a '' Myrtle Reed Year Book '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- which will please her old friends and win new ones .

		Miss
Jeannette L. Gilder	PERSON	contributes a short preface , and Miss
Mary Badollet Powell	PERSON	a bio - graphical sketch with some critical appreciation of
Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		The books of prose and verse , sixteen in number , from which the calendar selections are drawn , have no lack of pithy , epigram - matic , and often homely sayings , such as , '' Fame is a laurel wreath laid upon a tomb , '' '' Pedestals are always lonely , '' '' When Gossip takes snuff , Friend - ship sneezes , '' and '' A good forgettery is a happier possession than a good memory . ''

		The book is beau - tifully made and has a frontispiece portrait of her whose wide popularity it is likely still further to enlarge .

		To find sententious passages in Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's books to furnish a quotation for every day in the year , and thus to put together a ``
Henry James	PERSON	Year Book , '' has been the joyfully-assumed labor of lit - erary love undertaken by Miss
Evelyn Garnault Smalley	PERSON	with the cordial approval of the distinguished novelist himself , as expressed in a preface , and to the equally hearty satisfaction of the novelist 's friend Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, as manifested in a second part of the same preface .

		Among these three hundred and sixty - six specimens of Mr.
James	PERSON	's felicities of thought and expression , it is no surprise to find few or none of apothegmatic brevity .

		Some , indeed , fill each an entire page , which makes the book all the more faith - fully illustrative of his style .

		The selections , ad - mirably characteristic and wisely chosen , have of course no reference to the calendar dates above them , nor do they even attempt a chronological order in re - spect to their source .

		The work quoted and its date of publication are given with every passage , and blank spaces are liberally provided for manuscript addi - tions .

		No one could be better qualified in several im - portant respects to sketch briefly and sympatheti - cally the life of

		A volume of eighty-seven pages presents in a few agreeable and stimulating chap - ters -LRB- `` The Child , '' `` The Youth , '' `` The Man , '' `` The Writer , '' etc. -RRB- , the phases of
Stevenson	PERSON	's mer - curial personality that most appeal to our curiosity .

		When it is added , in further description of the little book , that
Stevenson	PERSON	the writer is disposed of in eight pages , and
Stevenson	PERSON	the poet in six , it will be seen that this is no exhaustive and critical biog - raphy , but rather a
Stevenson	PERSON	primer for younger readers ; and as such it is to be commended .

		The Best English and Scottish Ballads , '' selected by Mr.
Edward A. Bryant	PERSON	, is issued by the
Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text of the ballads adopted by the editor is in general that of the
Percy Folio MS.	PERSON	, as edited by
Hales	PERSON	and
Furnivall	PERSON	; but `` a few changes in the way of omissions of too broad verses and toning down of coarse phrases , with due care not to change the sense , have been made . ''

		The dedication is , appropriately , `` to the memory of
Francis James Child	PERSON	. ''

		The book runs to three hundred and seventy-five pages , with glossary and index , and has a frontispiece illustration to `` The Nut-Brown Maid . '' ''

		The Twelve Best Tales by English Writers , '' selected by Mr.
Adam L. Gowans	PERSON	, forms a companion volume to `` The Best English and Scottish Ballads '' issued by the
T. Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The twelve tales should strictly be called '' British '' rather than `` En - glish , '' since they include stories by
Scott	PERSON	,
James Hogg	PERSON	, Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, and
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The English writers represented are
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thack	PERSON	- eray , and Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, a minority , in fact .

		De - signation of the particular work drawn upon in each instance would have been not out of place ; but no such bibliographical finger-posts appear , except one or two in the Preface .

		The selections themselves are good , and they are preceded by a portrait of Sir
Walter	PERSON	and the above-mentioned preface .

		Negro verse , like negro music , has a nameless charm of its own .

		Among the best of the good old - fashioned `` darky '' songs and jingles are those contained in ``
Ben King	PERSON	's
Southland	ORGANIZATION	Melodies '' -LRB-
Forbes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , illustrated from photographs of ne - gro characters and scenes from negro life by Miss
Essie Collins Matthews	PERSON	and Mr.

Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's rendering of the '' Rubaiyat , '' Whittier 's '' Snowbound , '' Mr.

Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' Deserted Village '' and '' Traveller , ''
Poe	PERSON	's '' Raven , '' Oscar Wilde 's '' Bal - lad of Reading Gaol , '' and
Lowell	PERSON	's '' Vision of Sir Launfal . ''

		There are but seventy-five of the '' Ru - baiyat '' in the FitzGerald booklet , instead of the hundred and one which he finally prepared ; other - wise there seems to be no shortness of measure in these diminutive reprints .

		The page measures two and one-half by two inches , and has a not ungener - ous margin .

		In a box only four and a quarter inches long , the set constitutes a quite marvellous example of the multum in parvo wherein present-day pub - lishers so notably excel those of an earlier time .

		Anthologies of the words of the wise seem to have a perennial popularity .

		It would seem difficult to do anything strikingly original in this well - worked field , but
Miss Marie West King	LOCATION	has nearly accomplished the feat .

		In the '' Recipe for a Happy Life '' -LRB-
Paul Elder	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- she has taken the short inspirational essay of that title originally written by
Queen Margaret of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	in
1500	DATE	, and added to it passages from later writers which expand the suggestions made by the Renaissance queen .

		The volume is elaborately deco - rated and bound .

		A third series of the popular '' Catchwords of Cheer '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- has been pre - pared by Mrs.

		THE DIAL 541 new edition sent us by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, to which has been added '' The Story of a New England Town '' -LRB-
Middletown	LOCATION	-RRB- , written twenty years later .

		Mr.
John Spencer Clark	PERSON	has contributed a lengthy and interesting introduction to the volume . ''

		The Autograph , '' a periodical devoted to the inter - ests of autograph and historical collectors , has recently been started by Mr.
P. F. Madigan	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The contents consist , for the most part , of hitherto unpub - lished letters by famous writers .

		The authorized biography of the late Dr.
Arthur T. Pierson	PERSON	is being written by his son , Mr.
Delevan Leonard Pierson	PERSON	, for twenty years co-editor with his father of the '' Missionary Review of the World . ''

		The biography is to be published as early as possible in

		Each volume has a frontispiece .

		From
Buffalo	LOCATION	,

		The courts , in relation to popular government , the President , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, are among the matters dis - cussed in this initial number .

		The issues dealt with in a magazine of this character are serious ones , and as a rule do not need the adventitious aid of illustrations in their presentment .

		This remark is called forth by the fact that the pen-and-ink drawings which accom - pany a piece of sociological fiction-writing in this num - ber are far from adding to the dignity of a magazine which claims to have ideals .

		The series on '' Modern American Library Economy '' edited by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	and based on the prac - tice of the library under his charge -LRB- that of
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	-RRB- is now about half completed , the latest of the pamphlet sections to appear being the fifth of part five , entitled '' Work with Schools : School Libraries . ''

		Miss

Dana	PERSON	.

		A strong plea is made for the full all-the-year-round use of public school buildings for public purposes , the branch library being one of the subordinate departments that it might advantageously shelter .

		Every detail of the care and use of school libraries is carefully explained , with accompanying illus - trative cuts and one full-page photo-engraving .
