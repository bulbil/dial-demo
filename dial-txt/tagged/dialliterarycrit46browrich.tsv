		BRIEFER MENTION 25 NOTES 26 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 27 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 28 THS : UNLITEBARY TEMPERAMENT .

		There is a familiar classification of men that divides them into idealists and realists , or Platonists and Aristotelians .

		They might also be somewhat similarly divided into those who look out on life through the window of litera - ture , and those who look out on literature through the window of life ; or those who never can get the full flavor of an action or event till it is served up with a literary sauce , and those who find no relish in a piece of literature till its substance is placed before them in concrete and tangible form .

		As to which of the two windows above-named offers the fairer and wider and richer view , there is room for differ - ence of opinion .

		Through which one the objects seen are less distorted by imperfections in the panes of glass , might be considered less open to dispute .

		A third question , whether the lit - erary or the unliterary person will write the better books , seems at first capable of but one answer , and that in favor of the man of letters .

		But let us pause and reflect .

		Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	has of late been cheering his soul with the glad vision of a dawn - ing German renaissance , a new birth of Teutonic literature and art ; quod honum faustum felix fortunatumque sit , say we , with old Livy .

		The Germans , however , are by common consent the most inveterately bookish of all nations ; and in creative literature there is more hope of an unlettered backwoodsman than of a pedantic bookman .

		The Germans are unsurpassed as lexicographers and encyclopaedia-makers ; they write the most learned and elaborate prolego - mena to still more erudite and exhaustive studies of all things that eye hath seen , or ear heard , or that have entered into the heart of man ; they publish huge
Bearheitungen	PERSON	-LRB- belaborings -RRB- of earlier books that are only a little less pon - derous ; they philosophize voluminously on being and not-being , on the pure reason and the practical reason , on the finite act or object as viewed under the appearance of eternity ; they refine on the categories till one is lost in amaze - ment at the fearful and wonderful subtlety of the human brain ; and they translate and edit , compile and revise , annotate and elucidate , till the wonder is that the very presses do not break 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, down from excess of toil .

		In the zeal of scholar - ship one German philologist will wax wroth at another and shed whole bottles of ink in the battle over a disputed iota subscript in
Euripi	LOCATION	- des ; or he will consecrate his life to the study of the dative case in Dionysius of
Halicarnassus	LOCATION	, or to counting the occurrences of the cognate accusative in the post-classical Latin poets .

		In short , your
Berlin	LOCATION	or
Leipzig	LOCATION	university pro- fessor will put into book form everything imag - inable except what will make a book such as one would ever dream of reading , from cover to cover , in preference to eating or sleeping .

		Even the giants of German literature ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	, are by no means free from bookishness in the sense that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Chaucer and
Scott	PERSON	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	are free from its taint .

		How much of
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's charm is due to the fresh free atmosphere he breathes !

		How little bookish is Cervantes !

		How unspoiled by study the style of
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	, of
Bret Harte	PERSON	, of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	in `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' of
Mark Twain	PERSON	in all his books , of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	in the best of his !

		On the other hand , who but scholars can thoroughly enjoy
Virgil	PERSON	or Dante or
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	or Pope ,
Keats	PERSON	or
Browning	PERSON	?

		Even
Tennyson	PERSON	appeals less irresistibly to the great public than does our simpler and homelier
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		Is there anything in the world of letters more astonishing than the wild fancy that the book - man
Bacon	PERSON	, learned author of the JVovum Organum and the De Sapientia Veterum , could by any feat of intellectual gymnastics have written the plays of Shakespeare -- could have even remotely conceived such characters as
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	and Verges , Falstaff and
Dame Quickly	ORGANIZATION	,
Katherine	PERSON	and
Beatrice	PERSON	, Jidiet 's nurse and
Lear	PERSON	's fool ?

		Bacon 's was a wonderful mind , but he had not
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's unliterary temperament , the mind not sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought .

		When it shall have been proved that
John Locke	PERSON	, for example , wrote the
Waverley Novels	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which would seem to be a psychological as well as a chronological impossibility -RRB- , then we will listen to arguments demonstrating the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The literary temperament is much given to juggling with words , and very pretty play it often is ; but in the end , as was said of Glad - stone , words have a way of juggling with the juggler , which is as contrary to the fitness of things as for the tail to wag the dog .

		The unliterary man deals with things : he craves actualities and will not be put off with their symbols .

		At the ordination of
Charles Francis Barnard	PERSON	, of whom the lamented
Francis Tiffany	PERSON	wrote so excellent a memoir ,
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	spoke a true word .

		Its application is broader than the special occasion of its utter - ance . ''

		The poor , '' said
Channing	PERSON	, '' are gen - erally ignorant , but in some respects they are better critics than the rich , and make greater demands on their teachers .

		They can only be brought and held together by a preaching which fastens their attention , or pierces their con - sciences , or moves their hearts .

		They are no critics of words , but they know when they are touched or roused , and by this test , a far truer one than you find in fastidious congregations , they judge the minister and determine whether to follow or forsake him . ''

		What is it that gives so undying a charm , so satisfying a reality , to some autobiographies , but the fact that they are written by unliterary yet not ungifted men ?


John Woolman	PERSON	's jour - nal ,
Wesley	PERSON	's account of his itinerant ministry ,
Cellini	PERSON	's frankly egotistic life of himself .

		Grant 's modestly direct and simple '' Personal Memoirs '' -- it is books like these that , in Luther 's phrase , have hands and feet and take powerf id hold on us .

		How present and real does Grant seem to the reader when he explains in his preface the circumstances attending the writing of his book . ''

		At this juncture , '' he says , '' the editor of the
Century Magazine	ORGANIZATION	asked me to write a few articles for him .

		I consented for the money it gave me ; for at that moment I was living upon borrowed money .

		The work I found congenial , and I determined to continue it . ''

		Again , in the later pages of the narrative , most agreeable is it to read what occurred when Lee called upon Grant to get the terms of surrender for his army . ''

		Our conversation grew so pleasant , ' declares the undated conqueror , '' that I almost forgot the object of our meeting . ''

		Dr.
Charles Conrad Abbott	PERSON	somewhere says of his boyhood friend and hero , MUes Overfield , whose mind hugged the things of daily life with extraor - dinary tenacity : '' Since his primer was tossed aside with a shout of joy , as of a prisoner set free , his eyes had seldom rested on a printed page , and never quite understandingly ; yet Miles Overfield , though unlettered , was not unlearned . ''

		There is one glory of the literary tempera - ment , and another glory of the unliterary ; and which is the more radiant no man will ever be able to say .

		The artful charm of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, of
Cicero	PERSON	and of
Horace	PERSON	, is so seductive that in their genial company one won -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ders that other and nider and simpler enter - tainers should ever be desired .

		Why turn one 's back for a moment on these aristocrats and seek plebeian society ?

		Some novelist -LRB- was it
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	? -RRB-

		has pictured a pampered epicure who at times was overcome with so violent a craving for a crust of dry bread and an onion that he would slyly procure these homely edibles , shut himself up in his room , and , locking - the door even against his valet , would in stealthy privacy regale himself on the unaccustomed simple fare , before he could be induced once more to return to the elaborate diet of his ordinary life .

		The bread and onions of literature the healthy mind persists in de - manding after a surfeit of banqueting on more artfully prepared viands .

		It is as if the intel - lect needed this occasional reminder to check its arrogance and recall it to the leVel of common things .

		The most aspiring balloonist can not sever his connection with earth : panting for breath in the rarefied atmosphere of the upper re - gions , he is forced to open the valve and descend to a denser stratum .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's account of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's finding , in the failing health of his last years , a singular solace in
Scott	LOCATION	's novels , a comfort such as no other fiction could afford , is more than a little significant .

		Lowell 's was preeminently the literary .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	's the unliterary , or , perhaps better , the unbookish , temperament .

		IK MARVEL .

		In that glad time before literature had burdened itself with the problems of modern life and society , and before essayists had conceived it necessary , in order to get themselves read , to write in a style that would have made Quintilian stare and gasp , and to startle their readers by roundly asserting that what - ever is is wrong and that what the world has so long held true and beautiful is in reality false and ugly , we used to take innocent delight in
Ik Marvel	ORGANIZATION	's gentle utterances on `` Dream Life , '' in his `` Reveries of a Bachelor , '' and in his agricultural experiences at
Edgewood	LOCATION	.

		Before ultra-cynicism and super - sophistication became so much the fashion , we enjoyed , unabashed and unashamed , his charming pen-portrait of '' A Good Wife , '' his peaceful medi - tations '' over a wood fire '' and '' by a city gate , '' and his harmless pre-matrimonial theorizing on the subject of love , `` whether '' -LRB- in the words of Plotinus as quoted by Biu-ton -RRB- '' it be a God , or a divell , or passion of the minde , or partly God , partly divell , partly passion . ''

		Those days are past ; but it is comforting to note that there is still a considerable demand -LRB- as evidenced by abundant cheap reprints -RRB- for the two little books that first made '' Ik Marvel '' known to the world , and that will do more than all his subsequent works -- now credited to
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	-- to keep his memory green .

		To young
Mitchell	PERSON	's frail constitution , which could not endure the rigors of the law , on the study of which he had entered in
New York	LOCATION	, we owe his devotion to the manifestly far more congenial pur - suit of literature interspersed with farming and travel .

		Threatened men live long ; and so it was that the physically defective young writer , nursing his pulmonary weakness at first on his grandfather
Woodbridge	PERSON	's farm at
Salem	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and later in
Europe	LOCATION	and on his own estate of
Edgewood	LOCATION	, lived to number his birthdays well into the eighties -- being , in fact , when death overtook him the other day , not far from eighty-seven years old .

		This turning to excellent account of a need for fresh air and an unconfined country life was characteristic of all Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's achievement .

		Familiarity with the soil and crops and farm animals led to a literary connection with the
Albany	LOCATION	`` Cultivator '' -LRB- now '' The Country Gentleman '' -RRB- , and a journey to
Europe	LOCATION	in search of health in
1848	DATE	resulted in '' The Battle Summer , '' an account of turbulent scenes in
Paris	LOCATION	during that season of revolution .

		A previous European visit had already supplied material for '' Fresh Gleanings . ''

		For at least three of his books he did not have to stir beyond
Edgewood	LOCATION	to find material ; and that he could gain inspiration from his wood fire , his grate of burning coal , or even from his cigar -LRB- which his '' Aunt Tabithy '' so cordially hated -RRB- , the most popular of his books has made abundantly evident .

		His brief Venetian consulship he planned to put to literary use by collecting materials for a history of
Venice	LOCATION	; but whether the shortness of his sojourn allowed him insufficient time for the needed study and research , or whether , as is far more likely , the writing of formal his - tory proved uncongenial to him , he never carried out his intention .

		Less profitable , therefore , in a literary way did this appointment prove than in the case of one of his successors in office a few years later , the author of '' Venetian Life '' and '' Italian Journeys . ''

		In this passing notice of Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's work as an author , reference should be made to his one novel , `` Dr.
Johns	PERSON	, '' the story of a
New England	LOCATION	country parsonage , which appeared originally in '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' but which probably very few of this generation have read .

		The ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' stamp is warrant of literary excellence , but the story did not convince the world that its author was a great novelist .

		Neither did his much later essays in literary criticism show him to be a very original or very penetrating critic of others ' work . ''

		English Lands , Letters , and Kings '' and '' American Lands and Letters '' are stimulating and highly readable , but hardly more than that .

		The collection of sketches entitled '' Seven Stories with Basement and Attic '' is drawn from the author-traveller 's '' plethoric little note books '' of Em ` opean wander - ings , three of the little narratives being French in 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, theme , one Swiss , one Italian , and one Irish .

		Probably it is true that , as has been alleged , our young men would not care to write in this style to - day ; and probably it is also true that they could not if they wished to .

		The style and methods of
Ik Marvel	ORGANIZATION	tend to recall
Washington	LOCATION	Irving ; they also remind one of
George William Curtis	PERSON	as we see him in ''
Prue	PERSON	and I , '' and they more or less vividly bring back the days of
Paulding	LOCATION	,
Halleck	PERSON	,
Willis	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, and their fellow-craftsmen in letters .

		A precious link with the past has been severed , and the world of literature is left the poorer .

		Yet undoubtedly our loss is the less keenly felt from the fact that the dead author 's best and most characteristic work was done half a century before he died .

		In fact it is sixty-one years since '' Fresh Gleanings '' made its appearance , and fifty-eight since the '' Reveries '' first delighted a wide circle of readers .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's place in American literature was so se - curely fixed long before his death that he might almost be said to have survived his fame -- a not altogether enviable fate .

		Appropriate for quotation in any obituary notice of
Ik Marvel	ORGANIZATION	are the subjoined sentences from his own '' Dream Life . ''

		The passage occurs in the introductory chapter . ''

		What is Reverie , and what are these Day-dreams , bat fleecy cloud-drifts that float eternally , and eternally change shapes , upon the great over-arching sky of thought ?

		You may seize the strong outlines that the passion breezes of to - day shall throw into their figures ; but to-morrow may breed a whirlwind that will chase swift , gigantic shadows over the heaven of your thought , and change the whole landscape of your life . ''

		Dream-land will never be exhausted , until we enter the land of dreams ; and until , in ' shuffling off this mortal coil , ' thought will become fact , and all facts will be only thought . ''

		As it is , I can conceive no mood of mind more in keeping with what is to follow upon the grave , than those fancies which warp our frail hulks toward the ocean of the Infinite ; and that so sublimate the realities of this being , that they seem to belong to that shadowy realm , where every day 's journey is leading . ''

		It may be a fanciful thought , but it seems not unfitting that the author of '' Dream Life '' and '' Reveries of a Bachelor '' and '' Fudge Doings '' should have chosen '' Marvel '' for a pseudonym .

		The very name is a protest against the nil admirari spirit , the blase cynicism , the unenthusiastic tem - perament of the worldly wise , which were so con - spicuously and so refreshingly lacking in
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	.

		He felt warmly , and was not afraid to show his feeling ; and for that we like him .

		CAS UA L COM MENT .

		Insufficient educational endowments give rise , every now and then , to startling and humiliat - ing comparisons .

		For example , the trustees of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, deploring the unsub - stantial financial foundation on which that famous old institution of learning rests , call attention to the fact that the gi'eat and wealthy State of
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania -- richer , several times over , than all
New England	LOCATION	-- has in her educational history provided endowments for education that would , collectively , about suffice to build two modern battle-ships .

		And it is proposed to ask the legislature to make biennial grants of half a million until , with funds raised from other sources , the
University	ORGANIZATION	shall have an endowment commensurate with its needs .

		That is all very well ; but we have a far better scheme to propose .

		Legislative purse-strings are inclined to tie themselves into hard knots when poor colleges and universities and state libraries , and other like beneficent institutions , come a-begging up the capitol steps .

		Now a sure and speedy financial return would accrue if all our leading universities would but suspend for a few years , or even for one year , those lesser activities that have to do with books and lec - tures and laboratories and examination-papers , and would give their undistracted attention to the larger interests of the football field and the baseball nine .

		By a carefully-planned and properly advertised series of inter-university football and baseball cham - pionship games , with reserved-seat and admission charges placed at a sufficiently high figure , the great sport-loving public could be made to endow all our higher institutions of learning , and everyone would have a grand good time in the process .

		On the morning after the late Harvard-Dartmouth contest on the gridiron at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, it was reported that forty thousand spectators were present .

		The priv - ilege of spectatorship cost about a dollar and a half -- perhaps more if one occupied a favored position .

		If sixty thousand dollars , more or less , were to flow into the college treasury with every match game played on its campus , what would there be to pre - vent the speedy filling of that treasury ?

		Our solu - tion of what has so long been regarded as a g ^ ave problem is so simple and so satisfactory that we wonder it has not occurred to anyone before .

		But the greatest inventions are always the simplest .

		• • • World-languages to suit all tastes , unless one 's taste is unreasonably exacting , have now been provided .

		Choice may be made from a long list of tongues , ingeniously and scientifically formed , and most delightfully free from exceptions .

		There are , for example , VolapUk ,
Lingua	LOCATION	,
Panroman	LOCATION	,
Inter	ORGANIZATION	- pretor , Esperanto , Ido , and Tutonish .

		This last ought to appeal irresistibly to Teutons and
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons , including , of course , Americans .

		Its in - ventor , one
Elias Molee	PERSON	, is a Norwegian , and his aim has been to compound a sort of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Germanico	PERSON	- Hollando-Scandinavian compromise speech -- a kind of North - European linguistic hash the scoffer may unkindly call it -- for North-European use especially .

		He thinks his predecessors in the fascinating art of language-manufacture have been too ambitious : they have selected their ingx * edients predominantly from the romance languages and then tried to impose their latinized compound on Teutonic peoples , or
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 9 they have proceeded the other way about .

		Mr.
Molee	PERSON	is less ambitious : he gives us a tongue com - prehensible almost without study over a broad belt of two continents , and does not trouble himself un - duly with the rest of the world .

		But the rest of the world must be reckoned with .

		Why has it never occurred to anyone to develop the large possibilities of pigeon-English as an inter-continental , not to say an inter-hemispherical , medium of communication ?

		Already it serves as a sort of linguistic bond between the white and the yellow races .

		Let the Mongols prevail on their neighbors the Slavs to start corre - spondence schools for the teaching of this simple , flexible , picturesque , and pleasing tongue ; let the English avail themselves of their present cordial understanding with
France	LOCATION	to introduce the ancient and honored Anglo-Chinese commercial language into southern
Europe	LOCATION	; let the colonies and depen - dencies of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	extend and widen the sway of pigeon-English over all the rest of the habitable globe , -- and very soon our observation , with extensive view , will see mankind , from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	, discom-sing together in happy harmony and enjoying all but millennial blessings .

		• • • Lights of literature as viewed by contem - poraries have not always been of dazzling bright - ness .

		Often these stars in the literary firmament twinkled so feebly to the upturned telescope that it is hard to believe them the same as those luminous bodies now so resplendent to the naked eye .

		But occasionally an instance is found of a writer of genius whose genius received early and fuU recog - nition .

		From the English literary periodical entitled '' The Author , '' which publishes monthly a '' con - temporary criticism , '' it is pleasant to quote a few lines of `` The Quarterly Review 's '' notice of `` Poems by
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, pp. 163 ,
London	LOCATION	, 12mo ,
1833	DATE	. ''

		For lavish praise couched in some - what old-time phraseology , the review is really a masterpiece .

		`` This is , '' says the reviewer , `` as some of his marginal notes intimate , Mr.
Tennyson	PERSON	's second appearance .

		By some strange chance we have never seen his first publication , which , if it at all resembles its younger brother , must be by this time so popular that any notice of it on our part would seem idle and presumptuous ; but we gladly seize this opportunity of repairing an unintentional neglect , and of introducing to the admiration of our more sequestered readers a new prodigy of genius -- another and a brighter star of that galaxy or milky way of poetry of which the lamented
Keats	PERSON	was the harbinger ... We have to offer Mr.
Tennyson	PERSON	our tribute of immingled approbation , and it is very agreeable to us , as well as to our readers , that our present task will be little more than the selection , for their delight , of a few specimens of Mr.
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's singular genius , and the venturing to point out , now and then , the peculiar brilliancy of some of the gems that irradiate his poetical crown . ''

		When sugar and honey of this sort are offered by a Quarterly Reviewer to a young poet of only twenty - four , surely that young poet is either more or less than human if he is not straightway convinced that this world we live in is the very best possible world .

		A PUBLIC LIBRARY OF PURE FICTION that is , of nothing but fiction , pure or impure -- in its own special building , and with its own trained librarian and attendants , is a development that seems to Dr.
Louis N. Wilson	PERSON	, librarian of
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	, not only worth serious consideration , but in a high de - gree desirable .

		`` The tendency among librarians , '' he is reported as saying , `` as among other edu - cational institutions to-day , is to specialize , and I would give the fiction library full recognition ... With properly trained attendants in this field it would be possible to classify fiction , and even to paste in each volume a typewritten list of other books deal - ing with similar subjects to be found in the library .

		Thus historical novels would contain a list of the best histories of the countries referred to , or biog - raphies of the characters mentioned , or histories of battles , and so on . ''

		And let us also suggest that psychological novels might contain a complete bib - liography of the literature of psychology in all languages , and sociological novels might contain a catalogue of the social-science studies of
Carey	PERSON	and
Maine	LOCATION	and
Spencer	PERSON	and their thousand and one pre - decessors and successors , and religious novels might have a manuscript appendix giving the names of especially entertaining works in dogmatic theology and theological controversy .

		But do we really wish to take our pleasure so seriously as all that ,
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons though most of us are ?

		The systematic study of English prose fiction as a university elective somehow has an element almost -- perhaps not quite -- of absurdity in it , and the solemn dedication of a library building to the art of the story-writer would lack a certain element of dignity .

		Novel-reading is by no means to be frowned down or discouraged , but it will probably continue to flourish in the future , as it has flourished in the past , without elaborate bibliographical aids or a specially designed architec - tural environment .

		, , .

		The cruelty of biographers in making mer - chantable copy out of those modestly shrinking but irresistibly fascinating men and women of mark who have professed a vehement unwillingness to be biog - raphized -LRB- the word is not in the dictionary , but it ought to be -RRB- , will manifest itself as long as biography continues to be one of the most attractive and best selling forms of literary composition , as well as one of the easiest for the average writer to supply in a tolerably acceptable fashion .

		The more urgently a great man begs that the memory of him may be interred with his bones , the more insistently will the greedy and curious public demand the publication of his life , while those who would fain see themselves go down to posterity in two volumes octavo -LRB- in the 920-class of Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	's decimal system -RRB- are nearly always destined to speedy oblivion .

		Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, publicly expressed his disinclination to be made the subject of a biography , and his published life was one of the best and most popular books of the season .

		Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	, in a fragment of autobiography writ - ten twelve years ago , made a picturesque struggle against his all-too-probable fate . ''

		Determined , '' he declares , `` that no mendacious scamp shall tell the foolish truths about me when centuries have gone by , and anxiety no longer pulls at the pen of the ' pupil ' who would sell the soul of his master , I now proceed to take the wind out of such speculator by imme - diately furnishing myself the fiction of my own biog - raphy , which shall remain and is the story of my life . ''

		And now , as inevitable sequel to the
Pennell	PERSON	biography of the dead artist , his sister-in-law , who is also his sole executrix and residuary legatee , writes to the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' a lively letter of protest , which will of course defeat its own purpose by increas - ing the sale of the life of the modest Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	.

		• • • The
Furness Variorum Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, begun thirty-seven years ago with the issue of ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' has advanced to the sixteenth volume , '' Richard the Third '' ; but with this latest publica - tion the editorship passes from Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	to his son , Mr.
Horace Howard Furness , Jr.	PERSON	, who , born and bred in an atmosphere of Shake - spearean studies , and early catching the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	enthusiasm that has possessed his father ever since the latter , at fourteen years of age , heard
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	in one of her Shakespeare readings , steps naturally into the place voluntarily vacated by his father , and undertakes to carry to completion the great work now nearly half finished .

		The delights rather than the drudgery of such work as this will present themselves to the imagination of most readers in handling these inviting volumes ; but that the task entails a vast deal of downright hard work admits of no question .

		If an editor has to collate the eight quarto and four folio editions of a play , besides all the more important later editions , and is obliged to read perhaps two or three hundred volumes containing commentaries on or references to the play , then a variorum editorship becomes no sinecure .

		To verify a single quotation perhaps the better part of a library has to be ransacked .

		In tracing to its exact source one line quoted by Knight as illustrating a passage in '' Macbeth , '' Mr.
Furness	PERSON	read twenty-seven of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	's plays .

		A work in which a single footnote of two lines may represent a month 's toil is surely a work to be viewed with respect .

		The completion of the
Furness Variorum Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	will be an achieve - ment of which American scholarship may well be proud .

		Hungarian impressions of American cul - ture , as well as of some things in
America	LOCATION	not coming under the head of culture , are readably presented by
Monseigneur Count Vaya de Vaya	ORGANIZATION	and Luskod , who has paid two visits to our shores and has caught more than a passing glimpse of the genus homo Americamis in his native habitat .

		Like most foreigners who have paid us the compliment of a `` write-up '' -- but not exactly like Mrs.
TroUope	PERSON	and
Charles Dickens	PERSON	-- he expresses himself as pleased with what he has seen .

		Standing , for example , in
Copley Square	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, he was stimulated and edified by those two monuments to letters and art , the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and the Museum of Fine Arts .

		They are , to his thinking , unique among their kind and most forcibly expressive of the mental qualities of the cultured Bostonian .

		After extended observation and comparison , the courteous count reaches the conclusion that our American
Athens	LOCATION	is still pre - eminently the city of culture , while
New York	LOCATION	rep - resents wealth , and
Chicago	LOCATION	commercial activity .

		Furthermore -- and perhaps here he lays on the honey with a trowel -- '' Bostonians are always easily recognizable .

		They have an immistakable stamp , entirely their own , which , when travelling abroad , distinguishes them at once as citizens of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Being reserved by nature , it is per - haps not always easy to get to know them intimately ; but one can not come in contact with them without being conscious of their innate refinement . ''

		This praise is , to be sure , sectional and partial ; but if , as has been seriously maintained ,
Boston	LOCATION	is not so much a geographical location as it is a state of mind , what is to prevent the country at large from meriting and appropriating the Hungarian count 's graceful encomium ?

		Thumb-prints for signatures are the latest things in dactylology as practised in
Cheyenne	LOCATION	, in far-off
Wyoming	LOCATION	.

		Readers will remember the curious experiments and studies in finger-prints conducted by that original genius and shrewd phil - osopher , `` Pudd 'n Head
Wilson	PERSON	. ''

		In
Cheyenne	LOCATION	, where foreigners of almost every known race and color are thicker than blackberries , and where every Pole or Bohemian or Lithuanian is as like to his fellow Pole or Bohemian or Lithuanian as is one blackberry to another , and where also few of these swarming sons of toil are expert with the pen , the bank in which many of them deposit their savings has taken a hint from
Mark Twain	PERSON	's book and adopted a system of thumb-print signatures that is said to give satisfaction to all concerned .

		Instead of written names in every conceivable kind of alphabet and degree of illegibility , the immigrant depositors leave on file , not their mark , but their smudge -- the impression made by touching the ball of the thumb -LRB- the right thumb , presumably -RRB- to an inked pad and then pressing it against a sheet of paper .

		These impressions -- no two alike , and defying the most skilful forger -- are to be seen also as signatures to checks , and so adept has the assistant cashier become in reading them that he can recognize a great number without referring to the record .

		Which all goes to prove that not only is there many a true word spoken in jest , but also many a useful and practical thought written in fiction .

		THE DIAL 11 A children 's story-hour conducted by chil - dren is the latest thing in library work for the little ones .

		At the
Pratt Institute Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, where three hours on as many days of each week are devoted to story-telling , `` the most interesting development of the
Friday	DATE	evening story hour '' -LRB- as the Librarian writes in her current Report -RRB- `` was the establishment of two branches of the Junior Story Tellers ' League , one for the boys of the
Friday	DATE
evening	TIME	story hour and one for the girls .

		These meet on alternate Fridays after the regular story , and the children take entire charge of the proceed - ings , presiding , deciding , and telling stories .

		The only restriction is that they must let Miss Tyler know in advance what stories are to be told .

		No boy or girl has ever tried to ` be funny , ' to tell a sUly story , or in any way to disturb the meetings ... The club meetings have averaged twenty-five -LSB- in attendance -RSB- .

		The stories chosen have often been those already told in the regular story hour , and the retelling by a boy or girl is especially valuable to the story teller .

		The discipline , the self-control , even the amateur elec - tioneering , have all been good for the children .

		One boy who wanted the presidency attempted to smooth the way to this important office by largess of candy , but he was ignominiously defeated -- a real triumph of civic righteousness . ''

		The children 's story-hour , for , by , and of the children , is certainly less open to some of Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's recent objections than the chil - dren 's hour conducted by library assistants , j j - • • ■ State certification of librarians , like the similar certification of doctors and lawyers , of pilots and chauffeurs , and of numerous other more or less exalted semi-public officials , has much to recommend it .

		At a recent meeting of the
Ohio Library Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation the committee on legislation brought to the attention of the assembled library workers a bill that it had draughted and that contained the following provisions : The appointment of a state board of examiners of would-be librarians , the board to con - sist of five members , each member to serve five years and to receive his appointment from the state board of library commissioners .

		The examiners are to be all librarians in good and regular standing , and at least two of them must be women .

		Not fewer than two examinations shall be held each year , and , if possible , simultaneously in different parts of the state .

		Certificates shall be for a term of years , or for life to such as are found duly qualified .

		Library experi - ence and also attendance at a library school shall receive credit as the examiners may determine .

		Other minor provisions follow in some detail .

		All this is well , and the public library spirit again shows itself to be active in
Ohio	LOCATION	, greatly to
Ohio	LOCATION	's credit .

		We may rest assured that the public library which once appointed as its librarian the lowest bidder in a com - petition for the combined librarianship and janitor - ship was not an
Ohio	LOCATION	public library ; nor will any such system of appointment ever find favor in that enlightened commonwealth .

		Letting in the light on the foul spots of putridity and corruption is the first step toward a restoration of cleanness and sweetness and health .

		A new departure in journalism has been taken by
San Francisco	LOCATION	, that city of so wide and so unen - viable a notoriety at the present moment .

		The '' Municipal Record '' shrinks not from revealing to the public all that is being done or left undone in the various departments of the city government .

		Every meeting of an official body is reported , awards of contracts are published , the names and salaries of new employees are made known .

		Spades are called spades , and graft is called graft .

		The '' Record '' was established in response to repeated and by no means unnatural demands from many quarters for such an organ of municipal publicity and frankness .

		An unvarnished , undistorted account of govern - mental activities was insisted upon . ''

		Thus it may be , '' runs the plain and concise announcement , '' that the publicity of such information may serve to stimulate the city 's servants to extra endeavor , and possibly to incite appreciation by the citizen of all actions by the officials that are in any way commend - able . ''

		Some such publication in every considerable city might well be started , and that too without waiting for the very strong and rather peculiar incentives that have operated in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	, which recently celebrated its quarter-centennial by inau - gurating a new president , dedicating a new law building , holding a barbecue -LRB- of a
Texas	LOCATION	steer , undoubtedly -RRB- , and indulging in a football game .

Sidney Edward Mezes	PERSON	, Ph.D. , is the newly installed head of the

		* '' Perhaps the saddest spot in the sad life of the actor , '' wrote
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, `` is to be forgotten .

		Great paintings live to commem - orate great painters ; the statues of sculptors are their monuments ; and books are the in - scriptions of authors .

		But who shall say , when this generation has passed away , how Yorick played ?

		When the curtain has fallen for the last time , and only the unseen spirit hovers in the wings , what book will speak of all the mum - mer did and suffered in his time ? ''

		Mr.
Paul Wilstach	PERSON	's biography of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	goes far toward preserving our recollection of his consummate art , and gives us , besides , a faithful portrait of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	the man -- a por - trait that does its distinguished original ample justice , without concealing those temperamental faults that marred his character .

		Taken as a whole , it is the most satisfying biography of a player of which the present reviewer has knowl - edge .

		The book itself , with its wealth of illus - trations and its dignified binding , its clear type and fine paper , compels a word of favorable comment .


Richard Mansfield	PERSON	's father was
Maurice Mans	PERSON	- field , a
London	LOCATION	wine merchant ; his mother , a famous singer ,
Erminia Rudersdorff	PERSON	.

		Richard , their third child , was born on the
24th of May , 1857	DATE	.

		The boy 's public life began in his fourth year .

		His mother was dressing for a concert at the
Crystal Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Refusals and threats only stimulated
Richard	PERSON	's determination to accompany her .

		Finally , the imperious mother yielded to the imperious boy .

		He was hastily dressed in his best black velvet skirt and coat , a wide embroidered collar falling over his shoulders , and together they rattled away in her carriage .

		His mother 's dressing room , the vastness of the stage , the lights , the strange noises and confusion , frightened the child and he clung close to his mother . ''

		When the stage manager came to the door to say that
Madame	ORGANIZATION	's turn had arrived , and that the orchestra was waiting , she strode majestically forth , as was her custom , from her own room straight to the centre of the stage .

		Her appearance was greeted hj a roar of ap - plause , which she acknowledged with queenly bows .

		She did not observe a subdued ripple of laughter , how - ever , and signalled the conductor to begin .

		The music quieted the applause , but it did not hush the increasing titter , of which she soon became painfully conscious .

		Richard 's father died in
1861	DATE	.

		His mother 's engagements in the first opera houses of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	continued .

		As most of her time was spent upon the continent , it was decided that the children should be sent to
Jena	PERSON	.

		There
Richard	PERSON	and his brother Felix attended a private school , kept by a Professor
Zenker	PERSON	, a famous master .

		Early in his school career
Richard	PERSON	painted one of the class-room doors a vivid green , and in the high pride of his achieve - ment signed his initials to his handiwork .

		The boy spent two years at the school Am
Graben	LOCATION	; then two years at
Paul Vodos	PERSON	's school in the little town of
Yvredon	LOCATION	, in
Switzerland	LOCATION	; and later at
Bourbourg	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	.

		Early in
1869	DATE	he entered on the experience which in after years remained clearest as a retrospect of boyhood .

		He was sent to
Derby School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he was distinguished in the athletic sports of the period , but not as a student ; among the boys he was known as '' Cork ''
Mansfield	PERSON	, -- perhaps because of his remarkable feats as a swimmer .

		He did , however , become the star performer among the schoolboys on '' Speech Day , '' acting his first role -- Scapin , in Moliere 's '' Les Fourberies de Sea pin '' -- during his first year at the school .

		In the following year he appeared , on the same occasion , as Shylock ; and the next year 's Speech Day witnessed young
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's acting in a German , a French , and three English scenes , -- and taking a leading part in each .

		In the
spring	DATE	of the following year -LRB- 1872 -RRB- he left
Derby	LOCATION	.

		It was his mother 's wish that he should enter Oxford or
Cambridge	LOCATION	; but the World 's Peace Jubilee in
Boston	LOCATION	offered her opportunities she could not neglect .

		These ripened into attractive offers to make
Boston	LOCATION	her future home ; and , this course being decided upon , the children were brought to
America	LOCATION	, and
Madame Rudersdorff	ORGANIZATION	s rooms in the
Hotel Boyleston	LOCATION	, and her studio , became one of the artistic centres of the city , to which artists from the four quarters of the globe were attracted as certainly as they visited
Boston	LOCATION	in the course of their American tours .

		THE DIAL 13 have escaped eagerly at night to the brilliance of the company always gathered in his mother 's rooms .

		Mr.
Wilstach	PERSON	gives us an amusing reminis - cence of this period , from the recollections of Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	. ''

		I remember -LSB- Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	is quoted as saying -RSB- a surprise party
Madame Rudersdoff	ORGANIZATION	gave on
Richie	PERSON	's birthday .

		They were nearly all young people present excepting myself .

		It was not a surprise party in the ordinary sense , but you will understand when I tell you .

		In those days we were continually invited to meet dis - tinguished musical artists at
Madame Rudersdorff	ORGANIZATION	's home .

		She provided unsparingly as a hostess ; she was really queenly in her hospitality .

		Hence her invitations were snapped up in every quarter .

		On this occasion we were invited to meet a newly arrived prima-donna , -- I forget her name .

		The hostess and her distinguished guest received together .

		I remember her as if it were yesterday .

		She was youthful in appearance ; uncom - monly modest in demeanor .

		She wore a red and white silk dress with a prodigiously long train , and had many jewels and an abundance of thick wavy dark hair which was the admiration of everyone .

		Some of us were put to it to talk to her , for she spoke only the European languages .

		The announcement finally that the great prima donna would sing produced an expectant silence .

		We were all struck by the phenomenal range of her voice .

		She seemed to be able to sing with equal facility a soft , dark contralto , or a silvery soprano , capping off with an octave in falsetto .

		After responding to several encores , she at length astounded us all by lifting off her towering coiffure and announcing imaffectedly : ' I 'm tired of this , mother .

		Let 's cut the birthday cake . '

		It was
Richie	PERSON	.

		He and his mother had conspired in the surprise party . ''

		Toward the end of his fourth year in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Richard	PERSON	became the dramatic and musical critic of a feeble daily newspaper , '' The News . ''

		When he resigned , he told the editor it was '' impossible to criticise for a man who was the friend of so many bad actors . ''

		The pyrotechnical temper of
Madame Ruders	ORGANIZATION	- dorff , and the gradual development of an explo - sive capacity on his own part , led eventually -LRB- 1875 -RRB- to the selection of separate quarters for the yoimg bachelor -- a modest room at 23 Beacon Street .

		Here he disposed his few pieces of furniture , bought a piano , and , since his allowance did not permit the purchase of many pictures , he drew and painted them on the walls himself .

		Painting was supposed to be his metier at this time ; his mother gave him an allowance ; the position in Mr.
Jordan	PERSON	's office was given up , and
Richard	PERSON	's friends came for - ward at intervals to buy his pictures . ''

		But , '' he afterward explained , '' when I had sold pictures to all my friends , I discovered I had no friends . ''

		Exhausted credit soon closed various streets to him .

		A knock at his door became the sure precursor of an insistent dun .

		Someone suggested that he give lessons in the languages he knew so familiarly .

		For a month he had a fashionable class of young ladies who were taught French , Italian , or German , and were , moreover , stayed with tea and comforted with music .

		At the end of the month the parents of the young ladies remitted promptly , and
Richard	PERSON	had a spread in his studio remembered to this day .

		Two days later he was hungry and penniless .

		The Sock and
Buskin Club	ORGANIZATION	, which had been organized in
1875	DATE	by
Mansfield	PERSON	and some of his friends , was now thought of , and the young men gave a performance of
Robertson	PERSON	's '' School . ''

		It was so successful that
Mansfield	PERSON	, who had taken the part of
Beau Farintosh	PERSON	, announced to his friends that for the advantage of himself and his creditors he proposed to give a benefit to himself .


Boston	LOCATION	's artistic set had its curiosity piqued by learning of '' An Entertainment to be given at
Union Hall	ORGANIZATION	, on
Thursday	DATE
evening	TIME	,
June 1st	DATE	, by Mr.
Vincent Crummels	PERSON	, on the Singers and Actors of the Day . ''

		It was whis - pered about that Crummels was no other than the famous
Madame Rudersdorff	ORGANIZATION	's son
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	.

		Of course the hall was crowded .

		With wonderful effrontery ,
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	occupied the entire evening with imitations of all the famous actors and singers known to his audience -- including his own mother , who witnessed the burlesque from her box , and laughed as heartily as anyone .

		Early in
1877	DATE	, with the promise of a contin - uance of his mother 's allowance ,
Richard Mans	PERSON	- field returned to
England	LOCATION	, to study drawing and painting .

		But brush and palette were not for him .

		His pocket-book was soon flat -- the sooner , perhaps , because of the extension of his acquaintance with the
London	LOCATION	bohemians .

		His chambers became one of the popular rallying points .

		For such evenings his scanty allow - ance forced him to pay the penalty of abstinence and exhausted credit .

		By
April	DATE	he was over - joyed to accept an offer of eight pounds a week in the German Reed Entertainments .

		His friends crowded St.
George	PERSON	`` s Hall for his first appearance .

		He had a small role in the comedietta which opened the evening ; later , he was expected to occupy the stage for an hour by himself .

		When his time came , he sat down at the piano and fainted dead away .

		He had not eaten for three days .

		Meanwhile ,
Madame Rudersdorff	ORGANIZATION	, in
Boston	LOCATION	, had learned that her son had given a few entertainments in English coun - try homes for pay .

		She was superb in her wrath ; she would at once cut off his allowance .

		And 14 THE DIAL -LSB-

		I , she did , punctually , in a letter which , '' beginning in very plain English , emphasized her resent - ment in French , German , and Italian , and ended in Russian , with a reserve of bitter denuncia - tion , but no more languages to express it in . ''

		The struggle of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's life began now in earnest .

		Long afterward , when at the meridian of his fame , he told the story , '' For years I went home to my little room , if fortu - nately I had one , and perhaps a tallow dip was stuck in the neck of a bottle , and I was fortunate if I had some - thing to cook for myself over a fire , if I had a fire .

		That was my life .

		When night came I wandered about the streets of
London	LOCATION	, and if I had a pemiy 1 invested it in a baked potato , from the baked potato man on the corner .

		I would put these hot potatoes in my pockets , and after I had warmed my hands I would swallow the potato .

		That is the truth . ''

		The sale of an occasional picture , or the accept - ance of a story or a poem by a magazine , were the sources of his scanty income .

		He strove to keep his appearance respectable in order to ac - cept fortuitous social invitations for the sake of the cold collations without which he would have gone hungry .

		Often he stayed in bed and slept in order to forget the hunger of the hours of wakefulness .

		Food seen through the windows of bakeries and restaurants seemed to him the most beautiful sight in the world .

		The year
1878	DATE	found him , with a second or third rate company , playing the role of Sir
Joseph Porter	PERSON	, K.C.B. , in '' Pinafore , '' in the smaller towns of
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Wales	LOCATION	.

		His salary was three pounds weekly ; and when he demanded an additional six shillings , he was cut adrift , and returned to
London	LOCATION	in desperate straits .

		The turning point of his career was accompanied , as he told it , by a remarkable experience . ''

		This was the condition of affairs when a strange happening befell me .

		Retiring for the night in a per - fectly hopeless frame of mind , I fell into a troubled sleep , and dreamed dreams .

		Finally , toward morning , this fantasy came to me .

		I seemed in my disturbed sleep to hear a cab drive up to the door as if in a great hurry .

		There was a knock , and in my dream I opened the door and found
D'Oyly Carte	ORGANIZATION	's yellow-haired secre - tary standing outside .

		He exclaimed : ' Can you pack up and catch the train in ten minutes to rejoin the com - pany ? '

		* I can , ' was the dreamland reply .

		There seemed to be a rushing about , while I swept a few things into my bag ; then the cab door was slammed , and we were off to the station .

		This was all a dream .

		But here is the inexplicable denouement .

		The dream was so vivid and startling that I immediately awoke with a strange , uncanny sensation , and sprang to my feet .

		It was six o'clock , and only bare and gloomy surroundings met my eye .

		On a chair rested my travelling bag ; and through some impulse that I could not explam at the time , and can not account for now , I picked it up and hurriedly swept into it a few articles that had escaped the pawn-shop .

		It did not take long to complete my toilet , and then I sat down to think .

		Presently , when I had reached the extreme point of de - jection , a cab rattled up , there was a knock , and there stood
D'Oyly Carte	ORGANIZATION	's secretary , just as I saw him in my dreams .

		He seemed to be in a great flurry , and cried out , ' Can you pack up and reach the station in ten min - utes to rejoin the company ? ' '

		I can , ' said I , calmly , pointing to my bag , ' for I was expecting you . '

		The man was a little startled by this seemingly strange re - mark , but bundled me into the cab without further ado , and we hurried away to the station exactly in accord with my dream .

		That was the beginning of a long engagement ; and although I have known hard times since , it was the turning-point in my career . ''

		For more than three years
Mansfield	PERSON	played in minor opera and minor comedy ; engagements being now the rule rather than the exception .

		He received the news of his mother 's death , and of her will , which made him her sole heir but contained the capricious proviso that no portion of the inheritance should pass into his hands so long as he remained unmarried .

		Then , one night in the
spring of 1882	DATE	, in his dressing-room ,
Mansfield	PERSON	heard a familiar voice ; his old friend
Eben Jordan	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	grasped his hand , and that night persuaded him to return to
America	LOCATION	.

		It was on the
night	TIME	of
January 11 , 1883	DATE	, that
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	played
Baron Chevrial	PERSON	for the first time , and woke on the following morning famous .

		There were many ups and downs in the years that followed , but '' Cork ''

		THE DIAL 15 outbursts of temper which robbed
Mansfield	PERSON	of the affection of American playgoers , however they might yield him their admiration .

		Mr.
Wdstach	PERSON	says : '' Most of his outbursts were the outbursts of nervous despair .

		At times before acting a new role there were moments when his confidence appeared to desert him , and he would break down entirely .

		Then he would toss away his part and pace the stage in yoluble agony , ieclaring it would be impossible to give the production ; everything and everybody , including the play and him - self , were beyond hope ; the opening must be postponed , etc. , etc. .

		At such moments no one had influence with him but his gentle wife .

		With soft words of agreement , the tender terms with which a mother would propitiate a child , she would calm the spirit of this mighty child , and in five minutes have him quieted , comforted , and back at work again . ''

		To say to a workman '' You 're discharged I '' meant nothing from
Mansfield	PERSON	more than a reproof . ''

		It was the habit of exaggerated words , '' according to the biographer .

		His unfailing patience and gentleness during the rehearsals of '' Ivan the Terrible '' were a matter of ominous comment among the company .

		He seemed , says our author , to be holding himself under a strain which would break him .

		This endured until the dress rehearsal , which passed swimmingly up to the fourth act . ''

		There , in the passionate confession scene , the tricky lines slipped , and with them slipped his seK - possession .

		There were five minutes of realis - tically improvised Tzar
Ivan	PERSON	before he settled down , but the burst was welcomed by everyone .

		An old-timer of fourteen years in the company said : ' I was afraid for him .

		And I was afraid for this piece .

		It seemed as if he had n't blown in the trade-mark .

		But it 's all right now . ' ''

		`` The evolution of a character in
Mansfield	LOCATION	's mind remained unexplained .

		He retired mto what Pater called ` mystic isolation . '

		Like
Rossetti	PERSON	, he became ' a racked and tortured medium . '

		But when he came to rehearsal , even to the first , it was with full possession of the new character , just as later , when he went on the stage to give the character to the audience , it had full possession of him .

		His performance of a role -- even of those which he retamed in his repertoire from his early successes -- whether in comedy or tragedy , was to him a sacred work , almost sacramental .

		He was first in the theater , never less than two and sometimes three hours before his first entrance .

		This time he spent in the seclusion of his dressing-room .

		But the preparation did not begin there .

		In the afternoon he took a long walk .

		When he returned he would see no visitors , none of his household , and his servants attended him in silence .

		He ate a light repast at five o'clock , with a book for company at table .

		Then he retired to his own apartment for a short nap and a bath , and rode away in his unbroken silence to the theater .

		And so into the dressing-room .

		When the call came for his entrance , and he emerged from his room , a metamorphosis had taken place .

		It was not the actor who went upon the scene , it was the character .

		By some process -- and it has been called self-hypnotism ^ he became the person he was playing .

		He carried the manner to and from and into his dressing-room .

		He acted the role all the
evening	TIME	on and off the scene , and it fell from him only as he put aside the trappings and emerged from the dressing-room his own self , bound for home . ''

		The Quest of the Ideai ^ Democracy .

		* We need a word that should stand in the same relation to amicus as socialism to socius , a word that all readers might approach without bias or nervousness .

		Socialism was an ideal name for a theory and system of political organ - ization based on comradeship and cooperation ; but strange perversions and confusions abroad and certain disagreeable events in our own country have brought it into unfortunate dis - repute .

		Fellowship might have been found adequate , had it not been for established connotations and a flavor of the archaistic .

		Collectivism and Communism are too cold .

		Brotherhood suggests too close an intimacy ; and it also carries with it a certain disturbing echo from the French Revolution .

		The
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	would be an almost perfect designa - tion of the ideal state in question , were it not already appropriated by an amiable religious denomination .

		As it is , we see no other alterna - tive than the adoption of a new word .

		Thereby we should be freed from the risk of repelling our more conservative readers , and could describe Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's latest volume as a dialogue on the new term ; for under '' Justice and Liberty '' he has given us a delightful interchange of views on some of the questions we commonly find emphasized by socialistic writers . ''

		A
Political Dialogue	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	.

		New York : The
McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the irrepressible Dean of
St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	's ; and it is probably true .

		The question is whether there is not need of '' wild work '' in some quarters .

		And whatever else may be said of the earnest socialist , or the intellectual '' perplexed inquirer socialistically inclined , '' he at least promotes thought .

		It is always easy to demolish certain features of advanced collectivism ; it is never quite possible to destroy the ideal of fellowship as cherished by thinking men like
William Morris	PERSON	or the central speaker in the volume before us .

		There is something appealing in the cry , '' We open the gates of the
Temple of Humanity	ORGANIZATION	; make yourselves clean that you may enter in . ''

		There is a genuine ring in the challenge , '' To unseat things from the saddle of destiny and to seat there the human soul . ''

		Nor does the cause stand still .

		To-day we are a little less sure than yesterday that the stimulus of self-interest is as fundamental in economic life as the law of gravitation in the physical world .

		Just now we are set thinking by a comparison of the most active quarter of a century in Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	's career with the twenty-four years covered by
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	's unremitting efforts on behalf of the fellaheen of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		There is some evidence for the validity of such a stimulus as good citizenship , or love of one 's fellow creatures .

		Again , we suspect rather frequently that the present arrangements as to property may not be as final as the course of the earth about the sun .

		With reference to marriage , hardy souls like
Galton	PERSON	will even point out that mating and procreation are at least as important as gambling or some other subjects of legislation ; and that there is a pos - sibility of improving the quality of the popxda - tion .

		A few of the most daring go so far as to dream that marriage might be more happy ; and one of them in his plea actually adduces the reports of our
Illinois	LOCATION	divorce courts .

		As to social classes , many Englishmen and most Americans have rejected the hierarchic view that God placed men in wisely ordered ranks and there they ought to remain in outward sub - mission and even inward gratitude .

		Because our institutions are an inheritance from the past , we no longer believe they are incapable of improvement .

		In short , there is a growing recognition of the obvious fact , albeit so long and stubbornly disregarded , that human nature is '' a Being in perpetual transformation . ''

		In man 's struggle up the endless steeps of the ages , he comes now and then to a plateau that appears to the more short-sighted climbers to be the final height , or at worst a fair dwelling place of reality not to be hazarded for distant goals , seen only in barest outline and often lost in cloud .

		Then the comfortable loiterers are either guided upward by the seer with the torch of the ideal , or driven reluctantly onward by the less fortunate of their feUows , whose cry is no less bitter than blind .

		And between these two forces , the reasonable appeal of the leader and the unreasoning impulse of the luckless throng , it is probable that for the future we shall give good heed to the problem of better social con - ditions .

		But we must return to our volume , -- although we have not wandered so far as might be sup - posed .

		In the course of his dialogue , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	treats such topics as Forms of Society , the Institution of Marriage , the Institution of Property ,
Government	ORGANIZATION	, the `` Spirit '' of the communities under consideration , naturally with various subdi ^ ' ^ sions and incidental topics in - evitably suggested by these general subjects .

		Then toward the close we have some rather impassioned but orderly passages on '' The Importance of Political Ideals as Guides to Practice '' and '' The Relations of Ideals to Facts . ''

		Such a cold summary is of course en - tirely misleading .

		The effectiveness , the justi - fication of the volume must depend on the winning method of treatment in the dialogue form .

		Sir
John Harrington	PERSON	, a frankly aristocratic gentleman of leisure , we remember from '' A Modern Symposium '' ; and
Henry Martin	PERSON	, an idealizing professor , we recall from the same volume and '' The Meaning of Good '' as well .

		The third sharer in the discussion is
Charles Stuart	PERSON	, a banker of broad experience , who keeps his feet stoutly on the earth .

		`` Never mind
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Aristotle I Modern philosophers are bad enough without dragging in the ancients at every point . ''

		Or , '' I am learning from this conversation that an ideal standpoint is one from which everything is seen out of proportion . ''

		Stuart and
Harrington	PERSON	find the Professor in one of his favorite haunts , recalling in spirit rather than by topographical detail the scene of the '' Phaedrus . '' ''

		I love the sound and sight of running water , the great green slopes fragrant with pines , and the granite cliffs shining against the sky . ''

		But if he is dreaming in this idyllic spot to-day , he must return to his constituency to vote to-morrow .

		And this contact , this in - terplay of the ideal and the actual , runs through the whole dialogue .

		The three friends spend their last day together in discussing the value of political ideals in general and the relative
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 merits of their three preferences .

		Given the personae and the subjects , our readers would surmise the general division of the treatment .

		In one sense , the dialogue can not be said to make any contribution to socialistic thought .

		Parts of it , without being in any way copied , recall some of the lofty and glowing passages of
Morris	PERSON	; and every point could be traced to one source or another .

		But it is a commonplace that appropriate setting and effective re-statement of problems and arguments often constitute a more real service than the introduction of new mat - ter .

		The topics here discussed are of such a nature as to justify frequent treatment ; and the indirect method of our dialogue is an invalu - able auxiliary to the positiveness of the avowed apostles of the cause .

		Sometimes we wish Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	were not keeping his English audi - ence quite so strictly in mind ; and one might hazard the conjecture that a more intimate acquaintance with some of our Western States would not be without value for a man who would understand them as quickly as this sym - pathetic
Cambridge	LOCATION	economist .

		With some of their experiments before him , he might intro - duce at least a parenthetical modification in one or two paragraphs .

		But herewith we are de - scending to details , for which there is no space .

		We may merely say , in closing , that we think the book is worthy of Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	; which implies our belief that it deserves to be widely read by thinking people .

		It is unnecessary to state that the English of '' Justice and Liberty '' is lucid and attractive .

		It does not seem to us that the finest passages reach quite the highest levels of our author 's '' Symposium '' ; but the style is admirable throughout .

		One sentence , however , on page 125 , made us pause ; and we are still wondering whether '' He 's no worse than you or me '' is due to deliberate antinomianism or merely to human frailty .

		We hope it is the latter .

E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		among the vanished ages , '' inspiration of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Racine	LOCATION	, and
Tennyson	LOCATION	-- belongs to a past which had leisure to appreciate the elegant and the exquisite .

		Lucretius , the supreme , the only , poet of science , still influences the thoughts of the leaders of thought , and will hold his place until the long-heralded epic of evolution is evolved .

		More than a century has elapsed since
Andre Chenier	PERSON	justified the plan of his ''
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	'' by the now familiar argument that the world of science is more poetic than the world of fable , and boasted that his
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, soaring on the wings of Buff on , should pass with
Lucretius	PERSON	, by the light of
Newton	LOCATION	's torch , '' La ceiiiture d'azur sur le globe etendue .

		^ ' But the verse of the Roman poet which he thus translates still remains the inevitable expression of modern pride in the wonders of science .

		It is still the text of our greatest living poet and radical , when he hymns the achievements of the liberated spirit of man : '' Past the wall unsurmounted that bars out our vision with iron and fire , He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and suns to conspire . ''

		There has been ample time for both the poet and his readers to acquire that familiarity with the processes and results of science which
Wordsworth	PERSON	said must precede the effective use of scientific matter in poetry .

		But nothing has come of it except
Tennyson	PERSON	's cautious experi - ments in dainty paraphrase ; and a few crudely ambitious epics of evolution and the rise of man , which posterity , if it remembers them at all , will class with
Darwin	PERSON	's '' Botanic Garden '' and his `` Temple of Nature . ''

		The vein of Shelley 's '' Queen Mab '' and
Andre Chenier	PERSON	's fragment - ary `` Hermes '' has not been excelled .

		And that at its best is a dilution of the austere sub - limity of Lucretius with the optimism of the eighteenth century 's Utopian faith in progress and perfectibility .

		And so it is to the Roman versifier of a second-rate and obsolete Greek system of philosophy that our Langes , our Tyndalls , and
Huxleys	PERSON	will still turn in their most exalted and enthusiastic moods , so long as the new pedagogy allows them to construe the Latin .

		They do not find in him , and they do not seek , a formulation of the atomic theory that will fit the new synthetic chemistry and the new physics of radio-active bodies .

		But they do find the consummate poetical expression of all the large moral and imaginative ideas which even the most advanced science can contribute to litera -
18	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ture and life -- ideas for the most part not peculiar to the philosophy of Epicurus , but the common possession of all philosophically edu - cated ancients , even of those who rejected the absolutism of their dogmatic Epicurean formu - lation ; I mean such ideas as the reign of law , the continuity of natural process , the univer - sality of mechanical causation , the infinity of space and time , the recurrence of cosmogonical cycles , and the insignificance of man in the face of infinite Mutability .

		Only the laws that determine the apparition of genius could explain how it happened that the '' De Rerum Natura '' was written , not by a Greek but by a Roman poet , and that under the inspiration of what apart from the vigor of its assertion of a few fundamental truths was the least scientific of the Greek philosophies .

		But that the poem , once written , should not have been superseded by any poetic interpretation of nineteenth cen - tury science is no paradox except to the most superficial consideration .

		Science may be in itself more poetical to the scientific mind than myth .

		But there are only two or three ways in which the poet can make use of it .

		He may expound it in a frankly didactic poem ; he may experiment in the method of
Tennyson	LOCATION	; he may try to rival the eloquence of Lucretius in the domain where the verified detail of modern science gives him no advantage over
Lucretius	LOCATION	.

		Now , though science is a new thing under the sun , the didactic poem is not .

		It has been tried from Hesiod 's '' Works and Days '' to
Philips	ORGANIZATION	's '' Cider '' and
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	's `` Art of Preserving Health . ''

		Its literary value has never resided in the ostensible theme , but always in the episodes or a few informing ideas .

		The pleas - ure derived from the exposition of the nominal subject is at most the expert 's interest in the ingenious expression in verse of what could be better said in prose .

		It is the curiosity of the professional latinist who reads
Vida	PERSON	's `` Game of Chess '' or
Addison	PERSON	's '' Battle of the Cranes and Pygmies . ''

		This aesthetic law is not abrogated by the fact that the detail of ancient science was erroneous and that of the science of to-day is supposed to be true .

		Minute and didactic expo - sition is not poetry , whether the thing expounded be true or false .

		The method of Tennyson yields a genuine but slight effect of Alexandrian prettiness . ''

		There sinks the nebulous star we call the sun , If that hypothesis of theirs be sound , '' is intentionally and plajdFully pedantic . ''

		Before the little ducts began To feed thy bones with lime '' will serve in a passage of curious philosophic meditation . ''

		Still as , while
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	whirls , his stedfast shape Sleeps on his luminous ring '' presents a definite picture , and belongs to the science -LRB- astronomy -RRB- in which the imaginative familiarity postulated by
Wordsworth	PERSON	is most likely to be attained . ''

		Break thou deep vase of chilling tears That grief hath shaken into frost , '' interests by its subtlety even when not fully understood .

		But these experiments in orna - mentation are not the predicted poetry of science , and
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's taste seems to have marked the limits of their present application .

		It remains for our poets to surpass Lucretius in his own domain -- if they have the mind to .

		It would be idle to predict that no modem poet will ever achieve this .

		But it is the plain fact that no poet has yet done so .

		Two great clas - sical books seem to have expressed once for all the two fundamental imaginative conceptions of the world -- the '' Timaeus '' of Plato , a '' hymn to the universe '' conceived as the work of benefi - cent intelligence subordinating chaos and neces - sity to design ; the '' De
Rerum Natura	PERSON	, '' a hymn to the scientific spirit emancipated from superstition , a hymn to Nature manifold in works , freed from the yoke of the gods , change - less in the sum amid eternal change , and suffi - cient unto herself .

		Macaulay marvels that what he deems the dreariest and silliest of systems of philosophy should have produced the sublimest of philoso - phic poems .

		But the poetry of the '' De Rerum Natura '' owes little to anything specifically Epicurean .

		Its inspiration is first the whole scientific and rationalistic tradition of antiquity from
Empedocles	LOCATION	and Democritus down , and second the poet 's own passionate abhorrence of superstition , anthropomorphism , and the petty carpenter theories of creation and design which the official apologists of religion opposed to his picture of the self-sufficing life of universal nature .

		The causes of this anti-theological pas - sion , of which there are few traces in the extant fragments of Epicurus , we are left to conjecture .

		Its effects on the fortunes of the poem would make an interesting chapter of literary history .

		Mythology and religion have always been the chief inspiration of poetry and art .

		But the impassioned revolt against superstition and sophistical apologetics has played a far greater part than the conventional histories of literature and philosophy recognize .

		Every generation since the

		THE DIAL 19 its Brunos , its Spinozas , its Shelleys , enthusias - tic imaginative rationalists who , beneath transpa - rent veils of mysticism , Platonism , or Cartesian - ism , have in their inmost souls been dominated by this passion for which they could find relief only in declaiming the verses of Lucretius .

		Add to these the readers who , like
Tennyson	PERSON	, are alternately fascinated and repelled by the supreme poetic statement of the doctrine which they can not endure to accept , and the chief source of the permanent power of the '' De Rerum Natura '' over the minds of men is made plain .

		In spite of the enormous Lucretian literature , there is still room for a study of the poem from this point of view .

		Professor
Masson	PERSON	, whom these introductory observations have kept waiting too long , can hardly be said to attempt this in his brief study of
Lucretius	PERSON	's influence on his own age , or in his concluding chapter on what the world owes to Lucretius .

		His estimable but not especially pen - etrating or original book is not easily reviewed with fairness by a specialist .

		It is in part a revision and expansion of the author `` s standard work on the '' Atomic System of Lucretius '' published in
1884	DATE	.

		In seventeen discursive and not perfectly welded chapters of very unequal merit and fulness of detail , it treats in the main competently and readably most of the topics that belong to a complete monograph , the life and times of the poet , the atomic theory , the Epicurean view of the world , the
Epicu	PERSON	- rean ethics , the Epicurean gods , the sources of Epicurus 's doctrine , poetry and science , etc. .

		The scholarship is sound but old-fashioned and not always critical or up to date .

		Professor
Masson	PERSON	appears to be unacquainted with recent attempts to acquit Democritus of the blimder of affirming that a heavy body falls faster than a light one in a vacuum .

		He has appar - ently not read Diels , and cites the pre-Socratics from the obsolete edition of
Mullach	LOCATION	, thus attributing to Democritus some ethical sayings which are plainly spurious .

		He labors unneces - sarily some obvious points , and fails to go to the bottom of subtler questions , especially in the Epicurean psychology .

		His literary and moral criticism is pleasant and true enough , but less trenchantly and vividly expressed than that of Mallock or SeUar .

		He still thinks it neces - sary to apologize for Lucretius .

		The book is a good and sufficient monograph for the general reader and the undergraduate .

		But it is not a notable contribution to literature or scholarship .

		Problems of
Race Friction	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The last few years have seen an increasing - accentuation of race-friction in many parts of the world , and it is no exaggeration to say that the problem of the races is everywhere becoming more acute , and must continue to become so on account of the greater intermingling of alien races where they formerly lived apart .

		Happy indeed is the land which has no such problem !

		We find it to-day a disturbing element in many of the possessions of
England	LOCATION	, notably in certain of the
West Indian Islands	LOCATION	; in
South Africa	LOCATION	, in
Australia	LOCATION	, in
India	LOCATION	, and in
Northwest Canada	LOCATION	; we find it in
Austria	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	; and of course it is always with us in
America	LOCATION	.

		The nature and causes of race-friction , and the possible ways of removing it , are matters which are now claiming the attention of more thoughtful men than almost any other questions .

		Each year brings us a new group of books deal - ing with this peculiar and difficult problem .

		Two of the latest contributions to this group are Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	's '' Race Questions , and Other American Problems , '' and Mr.
Alfred H. Stone	PERSON	's '' Studies in the American Race Problem . ''

		The author of one of these books is a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor ; the other is a young
Mississippi	LOCATION	planter of education and practical experience .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	's volume is a col - lection of largely unrelated essays , only two of which call for mention in this review .

		These are entitled '' Race Questions and Race Preju - dices '' and '' Provincialism . ''

		In the former he examines into the causes and nature of race - prejudice ; in the latter he discusses the meaning of provincialism , its uses and its evils .

		Profes - sor
Royce	PERSON	contrasts the situation in the
United States	LOCATION	with that in
Jamaica	LOCATION	and
Trinidad	LOCATION	, where , he asserts , race-friction has been reduced to a minimum by the peculiar character of English administration and by English reticence .

		The maintenance of an efficient country constab - ulary into which negroes are admitted is one of the many policies which , in the opinion of Professor
Royce	PERSON	, have been adopted to secure the loyalty and respect of the negro popula - tion .

		Moreover , the English habit of ruling the inferior race without publicly claiming the virtues of superiority tends very greatly , he thinks , to remove a source of irritation * Race Questions , and Other American Problems .

		ao THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, which lies at the bottom of much of the trouble in
North America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Stone	PERSON	's work is a much more elaborate study of the negro problem , and is based on his experience and observations as an extensive employer of negro labor on a
Mississippi	LOCATION	planta - tion .

		To his personal observation he has added ten or fifteen years of systematic and almost continuous study of the literature dealing with the history of the negro race in
America	LOCATION	.

		His equipment , therefore , is such as to inspire the reader of his volume with a feeling of confidence .

		He contrasts the attitude of the
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	white people , discusses the grounds of difference , reviews at length some plantation experiments of his own with the negro , describes the somewhat remarkable condition of affairs in the
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- the great black belt of
Mississippi	LOCATION	, where he declares there is but little race-friction -RRB- , considers the economic future of the negro , discourses upon the causes and results of the increasing friction between the races , criticises President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's negro policy and compares it with that of President
McKinley	PERSON	, emphasizes the factor of the mulatto element in the question , and considers at length the political aspects of the negro problem .

		On the whole , Mr.
Stone	PERSON	's point of view is that of the Southern white man , though his discussion is so free from evidence of passion and his con - clusions are based on such wide study and ex - tended observation that they command respect even where they do not compel conviction .

		So far , no study of the negro problem has been produced which throws so much light on the whole question of the social , economic , and polit - ical life of the negro race in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is the work of a man who not only knows the situation from personal contact with the negro , but possesses in addition a rare theoretical knowledge based on wide and systematic reading .

		Three chapters of the book are contributed by Professor
Walter F. Wilcox	PERSON	; these deal with the criminality of the negro , the causes of its increase , and the resulting influence upon race relations ; census statistics relating to the wealth , population , occupations , education , and death rate of the race ; and the probable in - crease of the negro population in
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	shows that the increase of crime among the negroes has been much larger relatively than that among the white race .

		The predicted in - crease of population among the negroes , how - ever , he declares is not justified by the teachings of the census .

		* The
Champlain Society of Toronto	ORGANIZATION	published last year the first volume of Grant and
Biggar	PERSON	's edition of Lescarbot 's '' History of
New France	LOCATION	, '' of which two other volumes are to follow .

		It now issues
Nicolas Denys	PERSON	's '' Description and
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	of the Coasts of North Amer - ica , '' translated and edited by Dr.
WiUiam F. Ganong	PERSON	.

		If it never publishes anything better , from every point of view , than these two works , it will have more than justified its existence .

		Professor
Ganong	PERSON	has brought within reach of the ordinary reader one of the essential sources of early Canadian history , and one which hitherto has been inaccessible to all except a few special students -- inaccessible for two rea - sons : first , because the original edition is exceedingly rare ; and second , because it is written in old French , and in a manner so faidty and confused that more than one scholar has dismissed it as unintelligible .

		The task pre - sented to the translator has been ♦ ' not simply to render a book of bad French into one of good English , but also to discover , and to show by proper annotation , the author 's real meaning when he is obscure , and the actual truth when he is in error .

		In other words , the book de - manded not only a translator , but also a com - mentator who had local knowledge of the places , the objects , and the contemporary records
Ijear	PERSON	- ing on the events which Denys describes . ''

		How happy Professor
Ganong	PERSON	has been in fidfilling these requirements , an examination of his work will abundantly prove .

		It is not too much to say that the Champlam Society could hardly have found any other scholar so competent in every way to interpret this most difficult of early Canadian narratives .

		In spite of its ambitious title ,
Denys	PERSON	's book is confined to the coasts of
Acadia	LOCATION	, or to what now form the provinces of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	and
New Brunswick	LOCATION	; but it is nevertheless , within this restricted field , a work of the first impor - tance .

		It narrates events , a knowledge of which is essential to a clear understanding of the history of
Acadia	LOCATION	in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, which are not to be found elsewhere .

		It describes the country and its inhabitants as they were in

		THE DIAL 21 half the second volume to an elaborate account of the cod-fishery .

		Despite its apparent tedi - ousness and present uselessness , this portion of
Denys	PERSON	's narrative is , as Professor
Ganong	PERSON	says , '' replete with interest from start to finish . ''

		It constitutes '' by far the most complete and authoritative exposition we possess of that sum - mer fishery for cod which played so large a part in the early relations between
Europe	LOCATION	and North-eastern
America	LOCATION	.

		It is , moreover , the best and clearest part of the book , the only part , apparently , which Denys really enjoyed writing .

		With excellent arrangement and all complete - ness , and withal by aid of many a vivid phrase , happy turn , and illustrative incident , he brings before us with the greatest clearness every de - tail of that business of which he was a thorough master , and a master in love with his work . ''

		One of the principal objects which
Denys	PERSON	had in view in writing his book was , in fact , to arouse the government and people of
France	LOCATION	to the possibilities of the cod-fishery of
Acadia	LOCATION	.

		This portion of the narrative furnishes a rather curious illustration of the fact that a man never writes so effectively as when he is describing something with which he is thoroughly familiar , and in which is absorbingly interested .

		Some of the most entertaining pages of the book are those in which
Denys	ORGANIZATION	describes the beaver and its wonderful works .

		None of our contemporary '' Nature fakirs '' -- as Mr.
Arthur Stringer	PERSON	unkindly calls them -- could hold a candle to this unimaginative chronicler , in the more than human intelligence attributed to the industrious and long-suffering beaver . ''

		It is necessary to know first of all that the Beaver has only four teeth , two above and two below .

		The largest are of two finger-breadths , the others have them in proportion to their size .

		They have rocks for sharp - ening them , rubbing them on their tops .

		With their teeth they cut down trees as large as half barrels .

		Two of them work together at it , and a man with an axe will not lay it low quicker than do they .

		They make it always fall on the side which they wish , and where it is most convenient for them . ''

		To place all these workmen at their business , and to make them do their work well , there is need of an archi - tect and commanders .

		Those are the old ones which have worked at it formerly .

		According to number there are eight to ten commanders , who nevertheless are all under one , who gives the orders .

		It is this architect who goes often to the atelier of one , often to that of the other , and is always in action .

		When he has fixed upon the place where it is necessary to make the dam , he employs there a number of the Beavers to remove that which could injure it , such as fallen trees , which would be able to lead the water underneath the dam , and cause loss of the water .

		Those are the masons .

		He sets others to cut down trees , and then to cut branches of the length of about two feet or more according to the thickness of the branch .

		These are the carpenters .

		Others have to carry the wood to the place of the work where the masons are , -LRB- thus acting -RRB- like the masons ' men .

		Others are destined for the land ; they are the old ones , which have the largest tails , and they act as hod-carriers .

		There are some which dig the ground and scrape it with their hands ; these are the diggers .

		Others have to load it .

		Each does his duty without meddling with anything else .

		Each set of workmen at a task has a commandant with them who overlooks their work , and shows them how it should be done .

		The one who commands the masons shows them how to arrange the trees , and how to place the earth properly .

		Thus each one shows those who are under his charge .

		If they are neglectfiU of their duty he chastises them , beats them , throws himself on them , and bites them to keep them at their duty . ''

		Everything being thus arranged , which indeed is soon accomplished , every morning each one goes to his work .

		At eleven o'clock they go to find something to eat , and do not return until about two o'clock .

		I believe this is because of the great heat , which is against them , for if it is bright moonlight they work at night more than by day . ''

		Let us watch them now all at work making their dam .

		There are the masons ; their helpers bring them the wood cut into lengths .

		Each brings his piece according to his strength upon his shoulders .

		They walk entirely upright upon their hind feet .

		Arriving there they place their piece near the masons .

		The hod - carriers do the same ; their tails serve them as hods .

		To load these they hold themselves fully erect , and lay their tails quite flat on the ground .

		The loaders place the earth upon the tails , and trample it to make it hold , -LRB- building it -RRB- as high as they can , and bringing it to a sharp ridge at the top .

		Then those which are loaded march quite upright drawing their tails behind them .

		They unload near the masons , who , having the materials , begin to arrange their sticks one above another , and make of them a bed of the length and breadth which they wish to use for the foundation of the dam .

		In proportion as some place the wood , others bring hand - fuls of earth which they place upon it , packing it down to fill up the interstices between the sticks .

		When it is upon the sticks , they hammer it with the tail , with which they strike it above to render it firm .

		This layer being made of earth and of sticks the length of the dam , they add sticks and then earth on top as before , and go on extending it always in height .

		The side to the water , in proportion as it rises , is lined with earth , which they place there to fill up the holes which the sticks might have made .

		In proportion as they deposit this earth , they place their posterior end on the edge of the dam , so that the tail hangs down ; then raising the tail they strike against the earth to flatten it , and to make it enter towards the water , so as to keep that from possi - bility of entering .

		They even place there two or three layers of earth , one upon another , beating it from time to time with the tail , so that the water can not pass through their dam .

		When they are beating like that with their tails , they can be heard for a league in the woods . ''

		In addition to the translation , and an exact reprint of the original text of
Denys	PERSON	's book , Dr.
Ganong	PERSON	furnishes a very full bibliography of material bearing on
Denys	PERSON	, to which Mr.
Victor H. Paltsits	PERSON	has added a bibliographical description of the original work .

		Briefs on New Books .

		The teacher and the taught .

		Although Professor
George Herbert Palmer	PERSON	has chosen '' The Teacher '' as title for the collection of educa - tional essays and addresses -- twelve of his own and four of Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	's -- which he issues -LRB- through the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , he possesses to such a degree that essential quality of the good teacher , vicariousness , that he has made his book almost as attractive and useful to the learner as to the instructor .

		Especially interesting to the general seeker for knowledge are his chapters on '' Self - Cultivation in English , '' '' Specialization , '' '' Doubts about University Extension , '' '' The Glory of the Imperfect , '' '' A Teacher of the Olden Time , '' and '' College Expenses . ''

		Even his paper on '' The Ideal Teacher '' and the two discussing the elective system as in use at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	are readable as well as professionally important and valuable .

		It is note - worthy that this teacher of ethics is opposed to the formal teaching of ethics in schools ; the dissection of conduct and motives he very sensibly holds to be fruitful of nothing but morbid self-consciousness and moral indecision , in the young . ''

		I declare , '' he says , `` at times when I see the ravages which conscientiousness works in our
New England	LOCATION	stock , I wish these
New Englanders	LOCATION	had never heard moral distinctions mentioned .

		Better their vices than their virtues .

		The wise teacher will extirpate the first sproutings of the weed ; for a weed more difficult to extirpate when grown there is not .

		We run a serious risk of implanting it in our children when we undertake their class instruction in ethics . ''

		Yet he would have all teaching , in the best and largest sense , ethical -- instilling , unintrusively , right prin - ciples of thought and feeling and action .

		His '' ideal teacher '' is '' big , bounteous , and unconventional , '' and is also endowed with the following four funda - mental qualities , -- an aptitude for vicariousness , an already accumulated wealth , an ability to invigorate life through knowledge , and a readiness to be for - gotten .

		The four papers from Mrs.
Alice Freeman Palmer	PERSON	's pen -- three of them reprinted from pe - riodicals and the fourth taken from the short-hand report of an address -- will make the reader share Professor
Palmer	PERSON	's regret that his gifted wife did not oftener give literary expression to her thoughts and ideals .

		The entire volume has a breadth of view and of interest and a charm of style such as few books on education possess .

		Some months ago the cable that r ^ eS?ml .

		transmits just and unjust things alike , brought the news that
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	had proved by scientific evidence the immortality of the soul .

		The more complete accounts in the English press reflected what had really been said more soberly , but sufficiently corroborated the trend of it all to explain the cruder interpretation .

		There is accordingly a considerable interest in the volume which has just been issued by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with the title '' Science and Immortality . ''

		The book is divided into four dis - tinct parts : the first is concerned with science and faith ; the second with ecclesiastical problems of worship and service in the Church of
England	LOCATION	; the third with the problem of immortality ; the fourth with the relations of science and Christianity .

		It thus appears that Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	as a layman is particularly interested in the church and in religions matters ; that he is abundantly persuaded of the truth and value of a liberal religious belief ; that he is desirous to rationalize his faith with his scientific view of the material universe ; that he recognizes as equally real and equally a part of the order of nature the inner spiritual life , which must once more be harmonized with the more objective uniformities of nature and which must be made significant in con - nection with the historical unf oldment of the religions of men , and notably of Christianity .

		All this is clearly stated , and will carry conviction , or fail to do so , largely according to the proclivities and con - victions of the reader .

		There is nothing notably new in the way of argument , and much of it comes suspiciously near to what may be termed special pleading .

		Thus , returning to the report of the proof of immortality , it appears that the author is already convinced of it on the grounds of faith , and yet is sympathetic to such additional truths as may come from seeming non-conformities and transcend - ings of ordinary experience in the way of telepathy and spiritual communications .

		In all this he quotes approvingly from
Myers	PERSON	, and sets before us once more the combination within one mind of a man carrying on rigorous impersonal research by one set of methods and standards of evidence , and yet equally engaging in another in which he gives ad - herence to quite different orders of probabilities .

		As a personal attitude , this is interesting and legiti - mate ; what is unfortunate is that the reputation of the physicist should become subtly involved in the personal predilections of the man of faith .

		Clurg -RRB- deal with Venetian life in the age of decadence .

		The account covers the period from the middle of the sixteenth century to the fall of the republic in
1797	DATE	, an age of much splendor and outward magnificence , of vast activities and many real triumphs , but also a period of positive decline in commerce , in industry , in military efficiency , and in moral strength .

		Consequently , when
Napoleon	PERSON
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 appeared in northern
Italy	LOCATION	all power of resistance was gone and the terrified patricians hastily abdicated .

		In his essay on the fall of the republic -LRB- the closing chapter of the work -RRB- the author appears to believe that the city should have refused to yield to the Corsican ; but the story of general decline that runs through every chapter in these two volumes is likely to convince the reader that aU resistance would have been useless .

		While the author admits that Vene - tian weakness was in large measure due to decay of character , external factors , he believes , were respon - sible to a far greater extent .

		The discovery of new trade routes diverted the Oriental trade to other ports ; the competition of
England	LOCATION	and
Holland	ORGANIZATION	ruined Venetian commerce in the north and the west ; incessant wars with the Turks in the
Archi	ORGANIZATION	- pelago consumed the vigor and the resources of the state .

		Of the increasing helplessness , the rulers were keenly conscious ; the motion for the abolition of the old regime came from the doge himself ; of the five hundred and thirty-seven patricians present at the final meeting of the
Great Council	ORGANIZATION	, '' only twenty voted against the sacrifice of their country ; five abstained . ''

		In general , the plan followed in these volumes is the same as in the earlier ones : the treatment is topical and descriptive , not chrono - logical and narrative .

		They have all the excellences of the earlier parts , and also share in their defects ; but these have been discussed in earlier issues of this journal -LRB- see The Dial for
July 16 , 1907	DATE	, and Jan -
uary 16 , 1908	DATE	-RRB- , and need not be recounted here .

		However , after all possible points of adverse criti - cism have been urged , the fact remains that in no other work is the student of Italian society likely to find so clear , vivid , and exhaustive a discussion of Venetian life , both public and private , as in these six volumes by Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	.

		For the pub - lishers ' part in the production of this work no critic can have anything but the highest praise : rarely does one find a set of books in which artistic effort is evident to such a high degree .

		The beautiful binding , the clear type , and the numerous illustra - tions give the publishers an undoubted right to claim that this set is '' in every respect a monumental piece of bookmaking . ''

		Life in a Books about the Civil War continue Border city , to multiply , and for many of them in war-time .

		^ YiQve is genuine need .

		The recent war books of greatest worth are those volumes of reminiscences by civilian participators in the con - flict -- the women and the non-combatant men .

		To this class belongs Dr.
Galusha Anderson	PERSON	's '' Story of a
Border City	LOCATION	during the Civil War '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Anderson	PERSON	was a Baptist minister in
St. Louis	LOCATION
from 1858	DATE	to
1866	DATE	; his work is based on his own recollections , on the published writings of others , and on the material in the great War Records collection .

		The list of subjects treated is compre - hensive and attractive .

		As a story of life in a
Border State	ORGANIZATION	city , the book is valuable .

		It is easily the best and most comprehensive account we have of the peculiar conditions in such a community , and much of it would apply to conditions that existed in the other
Border States	LOCATION	.

		The story holds the attention from beginning to end .

		It tells how a city strongly Southern in sentiment was held by force in the
Union	LOCATION	; how Unionism was strengthened ; how the neutral and indifferent were converted into
Union	LOCATION	- ists ; how the people were divided in religious , social , and political matters .

		Dr.
Anderson	PERSON	makes it clear that it was the German element in
Missouri	LOCATION	which saved the
State	ORGANIZATION	to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the best things in the volume is the account of the psy - chological influences brought to bear by the
Union	ORGANIZATION	- ists upon the members of the Convention of
1861	DATE	.

		The writer aims to be impartial , and is certainly not bitter ; but he never sees , probably never saw , the other side of the case .

		On all that concerns the troubles in the churches , the fight over secession , the question of slavery , of partisan politics , of the bitter feelings that resulted from the many contro - versies of the time , he is wholly partisan ; he simply states one side , and appears never to have heard of any other .

		This causes his text to give the impres - sion that the Unionists of
Missouri	LOCATION	, though in con - trol of the state and of the city , were continuously persecuted by the Confederate sympathizers ; and also makes it appear , although without intention , that the Southern women were frequently coarse , brutal , and at times addicted to the use of profanity .

		The work is worth much as a source which the historian may later make use of .

		Its onesidedness may be offset by the opposite bias of Confederate memoirs .

		The most direct method of acquiring a ^ ur colleges ' ^ pessimistic attitude towards the value of American education is to attend a few teachers ' meetings .

		A vaguely enthusiastic audience responds , with a zeal mistaken for loyalty , to a wildly extravagant laudation of the teacher 's calling , or to an oratorically brilliant and empty appraisal of education as a panacea for all ills -- except apparently this vain exhibition of the futility of it all .

		It is accordingly with a very unusual cordiality that one greets the little volume by Mr.
Abraham Flexner	PERSON	, < ' The American College : A Criticism '' -LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For it contains a serious , large-viewed survey of what is really going on in school and college , a sober appreciation of what education may be expected to do , a sane per - spective of values amid the practical possibilities of the situation , and a clear appraisal of the merits and defects of current institutions .

		The emphasis is consistently placed upon the college -- not the specialist 's university -- as the institution best adapted to carry the young man -LRB- and young woman -RRB- across the most vital period of his formative career and secure for him the realization of his capabilities and their proper training for efficiency .

		Mr ,
Flexner	ORGANIZATION	finds that the American college '' is peda - gogically deficient , and unnecessarily deficient , alike in earnestness and in intelligence ; that in conse - quence our college students are , and for the most part 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Evolution upside down .

		emerge , flighty , superficial , and immature , lacking , as a class , concentration , seriousness , and thorough - ness . ''

		The elective system in its unrestrained form is held accountable for some of this , the ab - sence of clearly conceived ideals on the part of those in charge of education for more , and the false strain - ing in behalf of graduate study , and the general tendency to look to numbers , statistical growth , and administrative success , for other aspects of the gen - eral failure .

		Lack of good teaching is recognized as at once a cause and an effect of the wrong em - phasis of things . ''

		Emphasis of the teaching motive will put an end to commercialism .

		Efficient teaching is utterly irreconcilable with numerical and commer - cial standards of success . ''

		Diagnosis is the first con - dition of scientific treatment .

		Mr.
FJexner	PERSON	's analysis is essentially of this type ; yet he is not without rem - edies , which he prescribes discerningly .

		The whole forms an admirable and timely criticism of an im - portant factor in the American problem , and one upon which a good deal more remains to be said and to be thought and done .

		When one takes up a book dealing with man and with evolution , the no - tion in his mind is that the discussion will in general be about what evolution has done or is doing for man .

		The attitude of Mr.
Tyler	PERSON	's '' Man in the Light of Evolution '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the exact opposite of this .

		It concerns itself with what man is doing for evolution !

		We are told -LRB- p. 188 -RRB- that '' Man 's share and work in the process of evolution is the higher development and complete supremacy of the moral and religious powers , just as it was the business of the worm to develop viscera and of the lower vertebrates to add new muscles and motor nerve centers . ''

		This sentence strikes the keynote of the constructive -LRB- sociological -RRB- portion of the book .

		It well illustrates the author 's unique outlook on organic evolution .

		Organisms play a very active part in their own evolution .

		In illus - tration of this curious attitude the following passage -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- , typical of what occurs throughout the book , is worth quoting : `` Worms lifted life to a plane far higher than that of coelenterates .

		After their appearance only muscular and seeing forms could hope to play any leading part in the world .

		They developed weapons of offense and defense .

		Life became harder , the struggle more severe , competi - tion more marked and harsh .

		A strong , tough , agile , alert body was to be developed .

		Worms led the way toward this .

		But they had only begun to utilize and realize the possibilities of the muscular system .

		As soon as this and the visceral organs needed for its support and service had been fairly started , the worm began to experiment in building a skeleton . ''

		It seems almost inconceivable that it was intended that this sort of crude anthropomor - phism should be taken seriously .

		Yet if it is meant only for a figurative mode of presentation , the facil - ity exhibited by the author in long-sustained indirect and figurative discourse might well be envied by a Chinese potentate .

		The book is a curious mixture of about equal parts of , first , the sort of biology in - dicated in the passages quoted ; second , a very thin and innutritious social philosophy ; and third , per - fervid religious enthusiasm .

		It can not be regarded as a particularly significant contribution to the literature of evolution .

		The domestic `` The Family Letters of Christina of
Christina Georgina Rossetti	PERSON	' ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , edited
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		by her brother , Mr.
William Michael Rossetti	PERSON	, reveal , as the editor says in his preface , '' a beautiful and lovable character . ''

		The substance of the letters , in truth , is slight ; and of the style noth - ing can be said except that it is simple , unaffected , sisterly , and daughterly , in tone .

		Little of import - ance is to be gained from the collection that is not already known ; but excuse for publishing , if any be needed , may be found herein , that , as the Preface declares , ''
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, by her work in poetry and authorship , made herself interesting to a great number of persons ; and that anything which tends to show forth her genuine self , her personality and tone of mind and feeling , can not therefore be totally insignificant .

		Nothing could evince these more per - fectly than her family-letters do . ''

		Supplemented by a few letters to persons outside the family , by some addressed to herself -LRB- by
Dante Gabriel	ORGANIZATION	, by
Swinburne	PERSON	,
Cayley	PERSON	, and others -RRB- , and by extracts from her diary , the correspondence fills an octavo volume , which is further provided with appropriate portraits , views of houses , facsimiles , and other illus - trative matter .

		A useful index , too , is added .

August , 1880	DATE	-RRB- may serve to close this brief notice . ''

		Startling , portentous , quasi incredible is the climax of Lady
Burdett Coutts	PERSON	's noble life .

		Can such ends come of such beginnings ?

		If so , may I never have gift , grace , or glamour , to woo me a hus - band not half my age !

		!

		I I had heard of the intended marriage , though I knew not whether truly reported : but of the disparity of years I had not an inkling .

		All amazements pale before this . ''

		Th d - s ' ^ ^ ^ contrast of nature and nurture ofovercaring -- the biological forces that shape for the health .

		q „ j. ends , rough-hew them as we will -- appears nowhere more characteristically than in the making or marring of health .

		To keep well and sane , shall we let ourselves fall back upon a tem - pered inclination , or struggle thoughtfully to regu - late our ways in obedience to a system ?

		Are we more likely to succeed by reason or by instinct ?

		Dr.
Woods Hutchinson	PERSON	is a naturalist , not an artificialist .

		In his thesis entitled '' Instinct and Heath '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the two are one .

		He is a bold and incisive advocate , and his strokes tell .

		Like all his kind , he frequently overstates his own side of the case , thereby missing the benefit of the confidence that goes out to the moderate , and bringing upon himself the suspicion of less thorough command of his data than is essential to an authoritative wisdom .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAii 25 Yet it is equally pertinent to remember that his aim is practical and his appeal a popular one .

		His knife is out for fads and superstitions , prejudices , and the over-zealous regimen .

		Diets are as apt to make dyspeptics as to help them .

		Pleasant things are not inherently noxious , as our Puritanic or proverbial misconceptions lay down , but are in the main pleas - ant because they are in accord with nature ; pleasure is the stamp of approval that nature gives them as their reward .

		Early rising may be economically desirable , but physiologically it is better to sleep all you can .

		While one man 's meat is another 's poison , it is so mainly in exceptional instances .

		For the average man meat is jast what he needs , and its place can not be taken by any of the substitutes for food .

		Appetite , reaction , cheer , unconcern , these are the signs of health and vigor ; they are normal , and to be trusted .

		All this is sound doctrine , most forcibly inculcated .

		It is a good thing to have so much of this side of the health question popularized , as against the endless systems that claim in a single experience to establish the falsity of generations of instinctive wisdom .

		Dr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	's prescriptions may be freely taken , though the prudent will add their own dose of salt ... jprom
Hampton	PERSON	M ' * '
Franklin Matthews	PERSON	's vivacious Roads to the account of our
Atlantic	LOCATION	fleet 's recent Golden Gate .

		cruise from
Hampton Roads	LOCATION	over the waters of two oceans to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, as contained in letters sent from the fleet itself to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun '' -LRB- and printed simultaneously in various other newspapers throughout the country -RRB- , is now pub - lished in attractive book form , under the title , '' With the Battle Fleet '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Four of Mr.
Henry Reuterdahl	PERSON	's drawings of the fleet are reproduced from ''
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly , '' and a few illustrations from photographs are added .

		As is already widely known , Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	does not in this narrative confine himself to a bald statement of facts ; he clothes the skeleton of more important events with the flesh and blood of humor and fancy , of human - nature study and portrayal , of bright conversation and vivid description .

		Among his most successful chapters are the one describing the ceremonies attending the crossing of the equator ; that relating the passage through
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	Strait ; the unex - pectedly amusing description , from the mouth of a boatswain 's mate , of a bull fight in
Peru	LOCATION	; and the account of the social life on a man-of-war .

		All those who like sea-yarns , and probably some who are not especially fond of them , will enjoy the book .

		J > ramatic ^ ^ ''
Charles H. Caffin	PERSON	furnishes the principles for sixth volume of the well-known thepiavvoer .

		`` Appreciation Series '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is entitled `` The Appreciation of the Drama , '' and aims to deduce from the experi - ence of the past and the present certain necessary principles that will form a basis of critical appre - ciation , on which the playgoer may establish his own judgment .

		He treats of the psychology of the audience , the plastic and pictorial stage , the actor and the play , the genesis and development of a plot , etc. .

		The salient points in the general history of the drama are lucidly presented with practical succinct - ness .

		Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	points out that the American dramatist shows a tendency to be an opportunist , to take advantage of some theme uppermost in the public mind and to treat it from the point of view of the man in the street -LRB- witness `` The Lion and the Mouse '' and `` The Witching Hour '' -RRB- .

		He believes that when the truly characteristic American drama arrives it will be distinguished by largeness of outlook and treatment , by the equivalent of that spirit which has opened up the West and has raised the material and political importance of the country to its present height ; that it will be essentially a drama of liberty -- viewing the problems that it pre - sents in relation to the national idea of equal chances for all , and with an independence of judgment that has in it something of prophetic vision .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Writings of American Statesmen '' is the title of a new series of books to be edited by Professor
Lawrence B. Evans	PERSON	, and published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		If we may judge from the volume of '' Writings of
George Washington	LOCATION	'' which now inaugurates the series , this enterprise gives much promise of usefulness .

		Most of the statesmen to be included already exist in '' Works , '' but in this form are too voluminous for either the ordinary library or the average student .

		Such a selection as is now to be provided will do much to extend acquaintance with a department of American literature too often ignored because of the mass of its material .

		Each vol - ume of the new series will include three classes of matter : first , those documents which are of themselves important state papers ; second , accounts of important events in which the writer participated ; and , third , papers expressing the opinions of their writers upon public ques - tions of importance .

		In the case of the
Washington	LOCATION	volume , this three-fold purpose seems to be very satis - factorily accomphshed . ''

		The American as He Is , '' by Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, is a small volume published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its contents consist of three lectures given a few weeks ago before
the University of Copenhagen	ORGANIZATION	, in pursuance of the exchange arrangement recently made between Danish and American professors .

		The lectures are neatly dedicated to the
University	ORGANIZATION	before which they were delivered , an institution '' whose beneficent activity began before
America	LOCATION	was discovered . ''

		The lectures consider the American in his three-fold char - acter of a political , social , and intellectual being , and are characterized by breadth of treatment and a clean - cut style .

		To draw , in large lines , a picture of that part of present-day civilization which the world knows as American is the avowed aim of the writer , and he reaches it with marked success .

		The closing sentence of his brief introduction is pregnant with meaning : '' For a genuine understanding of the government and of the intellectual and moral temper of the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, one must know thoroughly and well the writings and speeches of three Americans , --
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, and
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	. ''

1907	DATE	. ''

		The texts are given in French and English -LRB- in parallel columns -RRB- , and certain related documents , such as the
Geneva	LOCATION	Convention and the
United States	LOCATION	Articles of War , are given in an appendix .

		The work is edited by Mr.
James Brown Scott	PERSON	, and prefaced by Mr.
Elihu W. Root	PERSON	.

		As the date of the Lincoln centenary approaches , interest in everything connected with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life increases .

		An important historical study annoimced for early publication is `` The Assassination of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
David M. DeWitt	PERSON	, whose scholarly work on '' The Impeachment and Trial of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	'' is known to historical students .

		An additional volume in the '' Authentic Edition '' of the writings of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	is entitled `` Miscel - laneous Papers , '' and is published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The contents of this volume consist of contributions to various newspapers and magazines , now brought together by Mr.
B. W. Matz	PERSON	, and filling a vol - ume of over seven hundred closely-printed pages .


James Dennistoun	PERSON	's `` Memoirs of the Dukes of
Urbino	LOCATION	'' has long been a standard work , but has for many years been unprocurable except from the dealers in second-hand books .

		No apology is needed for the handsome new edition , in three volumes , which has been edited and amiotated by that approved lover of
Italy	LOCATION	, Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	.

		The
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish this work .

		The
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us the first of two volumes of '' Piano Compositions '' by
Louis Moreau Gottschalk	PERSON	, with a biographical sketch by Mr.
William Arms Fisher	PERSON	.

		Here we have `` The Last Hope , '' '' The Maiden 's Blush , '' '' The Dying Poet , '' and a dozen others of the sentimental pieces so familiar to the last genei'ation , and so vastly better than the '' popular '' music upon which the young people of to-day are surfeited .

		The first fruits of the labors of the recently organized
Concordance Society	ORGANIZATION	come to us in `` AConcordance to the English Poems of Thomas Gray , '' edited by Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	, and published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is of moderate compass , and its early appearance has been made possible by the friendly col - laboration of a dozen or more scholars who have made the excerpts and read the proofs .

		The popularity of Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	's handbook , '' The Standard Operas , '' is evidenced by the announce - ment of the publishers that they are just putting to press the fifth printing of the new illustrated edition .

		This edition was first issued in
October , 1896	DATE	, at which time the book was entirely rewritten and illustrations added .

		The work originally was published in
1885	DATE	, was revised in
1896	DATE	, then reset in
1906	DATE	, and the present is the twenty-fourth edition of the book since the beginning .

		NOTES 56 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 57 THE NEW REALISM .

		Some twenty years ago , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	said , in terms that invited much sarcastic comment , that '' the art of fiction has , in fact , become a finer art than it was with
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		We could not suffer the confidential attitude of the latter , nor the mannerism of the former , any more than we could endure the prolixity of
Richardson	PERSON	or the coarseness of Fielding . ''

		But it seems fair to urge that we do suffer the con - fidential attitude of , let us say , Mr.
DeMorgan	PERSON	, and the mannerism of Sir
George Meredith	PERSON	without feeling that we are going critically very far wrong .

		And we can without much difficulty fancy some critic a score of years hence won - dering how it was that much popular fiction of the period about
1900	DATE	could have been taken for serious literature , in view of its lack-lustre manner , its photographic hardness of line , its preoccupation with trivialities , and its dulness of imagination .

		Our supposititious critic would be as wide of the truth , as unjust in his balanc - ing of values , as was his actual prototype above cited , and both would appear , to a vision trained in observation of the ebb and flow of literary fashions , to have mistaken the accident for the substance , to have failed in discernment of the qualities which make literature vital and en - during .

		The pressure of every age remoulds the stuff of life to its own liking , and invests it with the garb of what at the given time passes for reality .

		A clothes-philosophy is as needful for the under - standing of literature as
Carlyle	LOCATION	showed it to be for the understanding of morals , but criticism does not often get far enough away from its object to see the trappings for what they are , or to distinguish true from sham reality .

		It is universal life that really matters , not the guise that life assumes in any particular age .

		As Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	says , '' The secret of appreciation is to share the passion for life that literature itself exemplifies and contains : out of real ex - perience , the best that one can have , to possess oneself of that imaginary experience which is the stuff of larger life and the place of the ideal expansion of the soul , the gateway to which is art in all forms and primarily literature ; to avail oneself of that for pleasure and wisdom 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, and fulness of life . ''

		It is well , for most of us it is necessary even , that life should be con - stantly presented anew , since its familiar modes are those which are most likely to bring to our consciousness its more secret and intimate mes - sage .

		This principle concerns the historian , no less than the novelist or the poet .


Signor Ferrero	PERSON	just now is giving a new reality to the annals of ancient Kome by relating them from the sociological angle of vision whence our present-day consciousness finds it most natural to view human affairs , whether past or present .

		He tells the same old story , but gives it fresh effectiveness by linking with it all sorts of familiar associations .

		So the imaginative writer will make his strongest appeal by keeping close to an idiom that is understanded of the people , only he must not , upon peril of swift f orgetf ul - ness , lapse from the essential dignity of his mission , or forget that he is one of the long succession of torch-bearers that are lighting the path of humanity pressing toward its ultimate goal .

		Mr.
Henry Mills Alden	PERSON	has recently given us a whole book about what he calls `` the new real - ism , '' '' the new literature , '' and `` the new psychi - cal era , '' and he really seems to think that the thoughts of men , as expressed in their imagina - tive writings , have become so '' widened with the process of the suns , '' so clarified by science and philosophy , that literature has at last come to its full stature .

		The works of Scott were mere literary gropings in comparison with the novels of '' the greatest master of English fiction , '' Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, or even with the writings of the modern magazinist , whose firm and assured step makes the great men of the past seem stumblers by comparison .

		A new '' Faerie Queene '' wordd be unwelcome to-day , and a new '' Republic '' would fall upon dull ears . ''

		We do not want another
Dickens	PERSON	.

		We are willing to turn him over with that other old playwright , Shake - speare , to the tender mercies of Tolstoy . ''

		The modern magazine , that instrument which brings the writer '' into intimate accord with the idiomatic expression of a general audience , '' has so refined our standards that the present age '' may be said to be the only one which has the complete retrospect within the range of its clear vision and catholic appreciation . ''

		If we mod - erns , in comparison with our predecessors in literature , '' do not loom up in so singular and striking eminences , we strike deeper and have a broader vision . ''

		As these amazing dicta multiply in Mr.
Alden	PERSON	's pages , we grow more and more bewil - dered .

		One
William Smith	PERSON	, an estimable con - tributor to ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's Magazine , '' was , we are told , the author of the '' two greatest philo - sophical novels in the English language , '' -- but we defy all casual readers , and most students of English literature , to name them .

		The phrase , '' from
Sidney Smith	PERSON	to
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, '' is at least a singular way of designating the line of '' the great English essayists . ''

		And we never saw quite such a jumble of names -- some fairly noteworthy and some absolutely insignificant -- as Mr.
Alden	PERSON	gives us upon a single page -LRB- 179 -RRB- by way of exemplifying `` the new quality of imaginative writing . ''

		It would be unkind for us even to mention some of them in such a con - nection , and the best of them seem but shadows when compared with the names of the beacon lights of our literature .

		We can easily agree with the author when he says : `` Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is probably not a greater genius than Fielding , any more than the intellect of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	was greater than that of Aristotle , or the crea - tive power of Tennyson mightier than that of ^ schylus . ''

		But what are we to make of the implied suggestion that the members of such strangely-assorted couples are for one moment to be thought of as occupying the same intel - lectual plane ?

		We have made some effort to find out just what are the qualities of '' the new realism '' that Mr.
Alden	PERSON	claims to have discovered .

		As far as his elusive method admits of logical statement , such passages as the following offer the best available clues to his thought : '' We take the evil along with the good , making no problem of their reconcilement , since they are elements in a natural solution . '' ''

		Literature , rejecting the unreal , has become homely of feature , with home-like sympathies , graces , and charms , and at the same time more subtle and wonder - ful in its disclosure of the deep truths of life than it ever was in its detachment from life or in its reflection of a life which has not found its true centre in a spiritual harmony and was therefore itself untrue , wearing all sorts of illusive or monstrous disguises . ''

		`` The very content of the art , the kind of human phenomena emerging at the stage of psychical evolution which we have reached , is unprecedented .

		All the old signs fail us ; the well-worn tokens have given place to an ever-fresh coinage .

		The creations of the human spirit are wholly its own , born of it , not made in con - formity with any logical proposition or mental notion , and they bear no stamp of extraneous authority ; what - ever of divinity they may have is in their purely human genesis . ''

		`` Formerly the imagination dwelt in the house of Fame , exalting heroic or saintly deeds and personali - ties ; now it is not busy with things that are memo - ,1909 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 rable or monumentally lasting ; it dwells in the house of Life . ''

		This is the best that we can do in the way of exposition .

		Probably these ideas are all implicit in the single phrase , '' It is the mild season in literature , '' which evokes our hearty agreement , although we can not interpret the saying in Mr.
Alden	PERSON	's sense .

		It is certainly a mild kind of literature that is purveyed by the type of maga - zine with which the author has been associated for forty years , but all its graces and refine - ments can not disguise its obvious lack of virility and penetrating vision .

		To support his thesis respecting the new real - ism , Mr.
Alden	PERSON	is forced to postulate a new Jiuman nature , and he does not balk at the necessity .

		Since 1870 , he tells us , there has been '' a new era of psychical evolution , involv - ing something far deeper than an increased re - finement in manners -- a revolution in human thought and feeling , a changed attitude toward life and the world . ''

		Furthermore , '' within the memory of men who have reached the age of fifty the human spirit has found its true centre of active development and of interpreta - tion -- its real modernity , which does not mean the depreciation of the past , but a deeper and truer appreciation , nor any break in the con - tinuity of culture , which is rather led into fresher and more fertile fields of expansion . ''

		We fear that this disclaimer will not avail to offset that '' depreciation of the past '' which is implicit in the whole argument of the book .

		However the fashion of literary expression may change from age to age , the substance of thought remains about the same , and in the deeper sense we have no problems that the ancients did not ponder .

		The angle of our vision is shifted , but the object viewed remains fixed .

		Mr.
Alden	PERSON	's effort to reveal in this twentieth century a new literature and a new human nature seems to us nothing more than an elaborate mystification .

		And , far from taking our current modes of ex - pression to be praiseworthy , we think that they err in over-subtlety and preciosity .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' recently said : '' Irrationalism in various shapes is for the moment the dominant note in every department of life , and it is at least as powerful in philosophy as in sociology and in literature . ''

		As far as literature is concerned , we take this fact -- since fact it seems to us -- to be the direct outcome of our departure from the approved ways , of our fev - erish desire to find new things to say , and new ways of saying them .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Professor
Rudolf Euckek	PERSON	, the winning '' dark horse '' in the Nobel-prize race -- though it should not be for a nnoment thought that he was voluntarily or consciously a competitor -- is an interesting and attractive as well as highly gifted man .

		Prominent in German philosophic and speculative thought for the last third of a century , this
Jena	PERSON	scholar and writer and teacher was little known to the outside world until about six years ago .

		An idealist in philosophy , and a Lutheran in religion , he repudi - ates the notion , entertained by his friend and neighbor , Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	, of a mechanical and necessarian universe and a materialistic origin of spiritual forces .

		The two men are earnest and enthusiastic students of the same great problems ; but how different the solutions they arrive at !

		`` Nobody since
Martineau	PERSON	, '' says one who knows Professor
Eucken	PERSON	well and is thoroughly familiar with his writings , '' has written more eloquently or thought more deeply concerning the reality of a super-senaual world , the inevitableness of a self - revelation of divine purpose to the human soul , the necessity of a spiritual rebirth through ethical en - deavor , the freedom of man 's moral personality , and its continuance beyond the limitations of space and time . ''

		His published works , which unite depth of thought , elevation of tone , and charm of style , are as yet little known to English readers ; but his most famous book , '' The Problem of Human Life as Viewed by the Great Thinkers , '' is even now in process of translation into our language , and will be published soon .

		It is not surprising to learn that miracles have no place in his universe of law and order , that divine attributes have never been granted exclusively to any one man , that there has never been a special creation of the world or a special revelation to any favored race .

		In personal appear - ance , to one who visited him at
Jena	ORGANIZATION	, Professor Eucken appeared as '' a square-built man , a little under the normal size , blond in type , betraying his sturdy Frisian descent from a stock said to resemble most among Germans the English race .

		Threescore years have silvered his hair and beard and furrowed his brow .

		Nothing could surpass the simplicity , genuineness , and heartiness of his greeting .

		One could well understand the saying of his pupils that Professor
Eucken	PERSON	wins not only their adniiration as a teacher , but their affection as a man . ''

		There is cause for congratulation in the better acquaintance with this man and his works that we are now in the way of making .

		, , , The indisputable claims of Greek liter - ature AND ART have a valiant champion in Pro- fessor
Mahaffy	PERSON	, who has come all the way from
Dublin	LOCATION	to remind us once more , in a course of
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures , that if we choose to for - get the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	, and to make the '' practical '' the idol of our worship , we are likely 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, soon to be confronted with the paradox that the most practical of all are the things that are beautiful and useless .

		Some of the lecturer 's reported utterances outside the lecture room are worth quoting .

		To him Greek is by no means a dead language . ''

		To con - sider a language dead which is the medium of com - munication of a numerous people is sufficiently absurd on the face of things .

		Its living importance is too little considered in the teaching of it .

		The mistake has been that students are not made to hear the language .

		Its study ought to be supplemented by discourse in modern Greek . ''

		He even maintains that the pronounciation of modern Greek is fairly close to that of ancient .

		The doing away with com - pulsory Greek in the college course he deplores . ''

		An idea gets abroad that Latin wiU do ; but I notice that our finest type of scholar stiU takes Greek studies .

		As an examiner , I constantly have brought to my attention the difference between those who have and those who have not submitted to a drill in the classics .

		Those who come up for exam - ination in French and German make mistakes which no classical scholar would ever make .

		The ushers who teach the modern languages are not so proficient ; their services come at a cheaper rate , and a general relaxation of the standards of scholarship sets in . ''

		Surprising to relate , our
Dublin	LOCATION	visitor finds one of the strongest characteristics of American scholarship to be '' its extreme laboriousness . ''

		He further says : '' Professor
Goodwin	PERSON	set the fashion with his Greek Grammar , and the rest have followed ... Amer - ican scholars tend to be more minute even than the Germans , and if they have a failure it is just that , -- r the emphasis on the grammatical .

		In one respect , however ,
America	LOCATION	ought to take the first rank , and that is in the finely systematized and organized libraries .

		I have noticed this wherever I have gone , especially at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		There is com - pliment in both the censure and the praise ; but that we are yet conspicuously at fault in being unduly minute and painstaking in our scholarship , is open to question .

		... The excitement of reading an index may not be the most thrilling in the world , but , given a sympathetic and imaginative reader , it is consider - able .

		This is the season of the annual index -- the way-finder to the past year 's treasures of periodical literature .

		In his latest volume of essays Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	expressed his preference for the dictionary if he were obliged to choose one book to relieve the tedium of solitary existence on a desert island .

		Far more stimulating , however , and infinitely richer in suggestion , would be a volume of
Poole	ORGANIZATION	's Index .

		Opening the lajtest instalment of that indispensable work , we hit upon such attractive and curiously juxtaposed entries as the following : -- '' Revel of the Sacred Cats '' and , immediately after , ''
Revela	PERSON	- tion , Divine , Need of Belief in '' ; '' Determined Celibate '' and , just before it , '' Deterioration ,
Nar	ORGANIZATION	tional '' and '' ditto .

		Physical . ''

		The causal connec - tion between determined celibacy and national as well as physical deterioration -- race suicide and all its horrors -- is obvious . ''


Polly Stevens	PERSON	's Calf 's Skin '' vies in piquancy of appeal with three articles on
Marco Polo	PERSON	that immediately follow . ''

		Author - ship and Artificiality '' has fine possibilities ; and so , too , it may be , to other eyes than ours , the page and a quarter of automobile headings may look irresistibly captivating .

		But the charm of the mysteriously suggestive is not confined to
Poole	PERSON	.

		Take 80 apparently forbidding an index as that to the weekly '' Financial Supplement '' of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		In its twelve closely printed columns occur such richly potential titles as these : -- '' Hard Times , Meeting with Courage , '' '' Hard Times , Enterprises which may be helped by , '' '' Magnates , Illness of , '' '' Optimists , '' '' Chelsea Fire , Destruction of Capital seen in another Mood , '' ''
Chicago	LOCATION	, one Industry there that is looking up . ''

		How comforting the assurance that while all other
Chicago	LOCATION	industries go about with eyes downcast , there is still one that bravely and hopefully looks up and not down , forward and not back , out and not in , and lends a hand !

		Who , we beg leave to in - quire , can find this a dull world as long as there are indexes to read ?

		... The new journalism in
China	LOCATION	is one of the forces making for the enlightenment of that vast realm .

		More than two hundred newspapers have been started within the
last few years	DATE	, and active measures are taken to ensure their being not only published but read .

		In some of the provinces the viceroys provide public halls where the illiterate gather to hear the news read aloud .

		Hitherto the chief newspapers of
China	LOCATION	were conducted by for - eigners and were mostly in the English language ; and even now many native newspapers publish a column or more of matter in English .


China	LOCATION	ought to have a vigorous native press , for it is the home of what was , until a year ago , the oldest newspaper in the world -- fifteen centuries or more old .

		It ceased publication because of its resentment at government interference with its claimed rights and privileges .

		It is expected that the modern newspaper will act as a powerful battering-ram on this Asiatic strong - hold of ignorance and superstition and stupid con - servatism .

		But the daily issue of a journal that uses type embracing eleven thousand different char - acters is an undertaking whose magnitude none but a compositor can appreciate .

		• • • The making of many monographs on economic themes was strongly deprecated by Professor
Patten	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	in his presidential address at the late annual meeting of the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Atlantic City	LOCATION	.

		In his opinion , our libraries are congested with those pon - derous volumes of transactions and proceedings , technical journals , and special studies , that accumu - late so rapidly , take up so much room , are so little read -- and , let it be adde , d , are often such a source of bother aud perplexity to the cataloguer .

		He
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 urges the economist to abandon the dry and tech - nical treatment of his subject , to write for the news - papers and magazines , and to '' arouse the imagina - tion by striking phrases and vivid contrasts . ''

		Furthermore , spurning the pile of learned tomes bequeathed to us by the earlier economists , he does not hesitate to declare that '' there is no renown worth having but that of the newspaper and the magazine and the class-room , '' and that `` there can be no economic literature apart from general litei ' - ature .

		We give the content to which others give the form .

		To separate ourselves from the general literary movements of the age is to deprive our - selves of influence , and literature of content . ''

		He exalts the editor , advises his hearers to desert the library for the sanctum , and speaks with no pro- found respect for the reputation based on books that no one reads .

		The economist should take his place on the firing line of civilization .

		`` No fact is valuable to the economist unless it is also valuable to the journalist who summarizes events , the editor who comments on them , and the reformer who uses them . ''

		This manifestation , on Professor
Patten	PERSON	's part , of a reaction from excessive specialization is a wholesome sign ; and yet it is also a danger signal , for it may serve as encouragement to superficiality , dilettanteism , the courting of popular applause , and various other sorts of unscholarly conduct .

		His exhortation is for the Dryasdusts ; let all others listen with mental reservations .

		`` • • The public library habit in olden times was rather slow of acquirement , partly for the very sufficient reason that public libraries were few and far between , and also because , in this country at least , so many other things , of more urgent import - ance than keeping abreast of the literature of the day , were clamoring to be done .

		In the
autumn of 1754	DATE	, just after a shipment of books for the
New York Society Library	ORGANIZATION	had arrived from
London	LOCATION	, there appeared in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Mercury '' this timely and stirring exhortation : '' We hope that all who have a Taste for polite Literature , and an Eager Thirst after Knowledge and Wisdom , will now repair to those Fountains and Repositories from whence they can , by Study , be collected .

		And we heartily wish that the glorious Motives of acquiring that which alone distinguishes human Nature -LRB- we mean

Prin	PERSON	- ciples of being useful to
Mankind	LOCATION	and .

		more espe - cially to our dear Country -RRB- will be sufficient to excite the most Lethargic , to peruse the Volumes pur - chased for this End by Means of the Advice and

New York	LOCATION	, now she has an opportunity , will show that she comes not short of the other Provinces in Men of excellent Genius , who by cultivating the
Talents of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, will take oft ' that Reflection cast on us by the neighboring Colonies of being an ignorant People . '' ''

		The History of the
New York Society Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' with an introductory account of '' The Library in
Colonial New York	LOCATION	'' from

1776	DATE	, has been well written by Mr.
Austin Baxter Keep	PERSON	, and printed , for the Trustees by the
De Vinne Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		, .

		.

		Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	's successor at
Washington	LOCATION	as assistant librarian appears to be a man of mark .

		Mr.
A. P. C. Grifiin	PERSON	, former chief of the division of bibliography , is endowed in no small measure with some of those qualities of mind and memory that distinguished his predecessor .

		No one has been more in demand on the part of congressmen and others engaged in '' getting up '' subjects for oratorical or argumentative or literaiy presentation .

		We are told that so much has bibliography become the warp and woof of his being that his brain is now a better and more complete catalogue than any the library possesses .

		Without a moment 's warning he is likely to be called upon for information on any conceiv - able subject ; but he is said to be unfailing in his resources .

		No library in the world enjoys the serv - ices of one who takes greater pains to satisfy the public ; and this unflagging zeal , and the quickness with which books or other material , or verbal in - formation , are forthcoming at the applicant 's request , are a constant source of surprise to foreigners .

		The British Museum , the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, and the great
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Munich	LOCATION	libraries are justly praised for the careful service they render to all admitted to their privileges ; but it is conceded by those who have worked in libraries both here and abroad that our methods are simpler and better , and our librarians and assistants less bureaucratic than those of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is the quick intelligence , the ready sympathy , and the well-stored minds of men and women like Mr.
Grifiin	PERSON	that help to make the practical efficiency of our libraries unequalled .

		The
Berlin Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	's ampler quar - ters , into which it will soon move , if indeed the re - moval has not already been accomplished , will make possible , one may confidently hope , far better and prompter service than was rendered in the old build - ing .

		Some of our readers may recall the tedious wait of twenty-four hours between application for and delivery of books under the old regime .

		No wonder German visitors to our great libraries are astonished at the quickness and informality with which the resources of those libraries are placed at the applicant 's disposal .

		From the latest annual report of Dr.
Adolph Harnack	PERSON	, general director of the great
Berlin	LOCATION	institution , it is interesting to learn that the library now has a million and a quarter volumes , that it employs forty-five librarians , fifty - seven assistants of both sexes , forty-five attendants , and so on , the whole force numbering more than one hundred and fifty .

		Last year there were lent 344,000 volumes in
Berlin	LOCATION	, and 36,000 elsewhere , while the average daily demand in the reading-room was 888 .

		Sixteen persons are constantly engaged 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, in cataloguing , and the number of leaves added during the last twelve months to the catalogue -- an ungainly , space-filling series of folio manuscript volumes -- wsis about 6700 , the number of titles about 18,000 .

		The accessions , in new and old vol - umes , amounted to 57,000 .

		The music department , now two years old , has received many gifts from music-publishers , and is already so important a part of the library that it furnishes employment to twenty persons .

		New York 's '' New Theatre , '' the corner-stone of which was recently laid -- although the building itself is outwardly nearly completed -- gives promise of achievement long desired by friends of high-class drama .

		And the wealth that is behind the enter - prise -- wealth pledged to self-denial in the matter of pecuniary gain -- inspires reasonable hope that at least monetary considerations will not bring to igno - minious failure this latest and most considerable attempt to elevate the stage .

		The reported plans of the administration make agreeable reading , to say the least .

		Only the best plays , whether classic or modern , are to be presented ; '' stars '' will not be encouraged to scintillate at the expense of the com - pany as a whole , which company , it is hoped , will be virtually an '' all-star '' organization , so that the playwright will be enabled to bring his conceptions to the fullest development ; a certain low annual rental the theatre will be expected to earn , but any income above expenses will go toward perfecting the work undertaken .

		The courting of custom is thus provided against -LRB- it is hoped -RRB- , and also the necessity of earning a certain income will obviate the danger of altogether ignoring public opinion and succumb - ing to that complacent apathy which unfortunately characterizes some of the European subsidized play - houses .

		Further developments , with the opening of the New Theatre next
November	DATE	, will be watched with interest not unmixed with anxiety .

		The possibilities of the correspondence SCHOOL seem not yet to have been half exhausted .

		Not only can everything in languages and literature , in art and science , in trades and professions , and in almost every conceivable human industry , be taught by correspondence ; not only can one become a law - yer or a linguist , a painter or a plumber , a carpenter or -LRB- perhaps -RRB- a car-conductor , by subscribing to some inter-continental correspondence school ; but one may also hope by the same means to learn the most effec - tive method of courtship and , finally , to win a wife from the school 's selected list of candidates for mat - rimony .

		Friendship , too , as well as love-making , is now taught by mail .

		In the advertising section of a
London	LOCATION	literary review occurs this item , most alluring to the friendless : -- '' To secure friends and friendships join the
Correspondence Club	ORGANIZATION	, 10s .

		6d . ''

		If the correspondence method proves equal to teaching virtues and inculcating abstrac - tions , how widely beneficent will be its scope !

		Pres - ently we may see classes started in the cultivation of bravery and modesty , of altruism and self-denial , of truthfulness and charity and self-control .

		The lowering of letter-rates , now going on , will help not a little in this matter • • • Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	in a new environment excites one 's curiosity .

		Will she , in her '' Marriage k la Mode , '' which begins in the current number of ''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine , '' succeed in avoiding those little betrayals of unfamiliarity with our ways and traditions that are all but inevitable in European pictures of American society ?

		The story opens well , with a visit to Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	on the part of the chief characters , and just about enough of reference to the historic interest and the natural beauties of the spot ; but a conversation , on the way back to
Washington	LOCATION	, between the hero and heroine , on the subject of divorce as practised in this land of free - dom , rather tends to wearisomeness and platitude .

		At any rate , it is not exactly novel to American readers .

		A passing reference to a lumber king of
Illinois	LOCATION	might -LRB- perhaps unjustifiably -RRB- suggest the query whether Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	conceives of the
Prairie State	ORGANIZATION	as still covered with primeval forest .

		What she will do for lack of English politics and English nobility to supply the necessary -- shall we say longueurs ?

		-- we wait with considerable interest to discover .

		The literature of library economy , already considerable in volume , is still growing .

		Although one can not learn from books , or even by taking a course in a correspondence university , how to manage a library with entire success , it is indispensable to acquire in some way a right theory as the guiding principle of one 's daily practice .

		A serial work descriptive of the methods pursued by the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library has been undertaken by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, with the aid of his assistants in the
Newark	LOCATION	library . ''

		Modern American Library Economy '' is the title of the work , and the first sec - tion of the first part -- treating of '' The Registration Desk , '' the Part as a whole having to do with '' The Delivery Department '' -- is now issued from the Elm Tree Press of
Woodstock	LOCATION	,

		ESPERANTO AND THE ESPERANTISTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The argument in your issue of the 16th of
December	DATE	, by an Esperantist , against reforms in Esperanto , is largely an attack against the person and motives of
M. de Beaufront	PERSON	, one of the sponsors of the simplified Esperanto -LRB- '' Ido '' -RRB- .

		These personal remarks I pass over without answer .

		It then goes on to aver that Esperanto can no more be simplified than English could .

		What a modest
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .41 comparison !

		English exists primarily for those nations that speak it to-day , the Anglo-Saxons ; hence English , as a national language , is a fact .

		Esperanto claims to exist for the whole world ; and since the whole world is still very far from speaking Esperanto , Esperanto as a world-language is still a project .

		English is the natural tongue of a hundred and thirty millions of men , and has had an individual existence for fifteen centuries ;
Esper	PERSON	- anto does not count a single man among its adepts who has learned it as his mother tongue , and it was pub - lished but little more than fifteen years ago .

		The correspondent proceeds to name
Ostwald	PERSON	of
Leipsic	LOCATION	, the famous chemist , as an approver of primitive Esperanto .

		With the same right
Washington	LOCATION	could be described as a partisan of King
George III.	PERSON	, ignoring all of his later Revolutionary career .

		The truth is that to
Ostwald	PERSON	, to the philologist
Jespersen	PERSON	of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, to the philosopher Couturat of
Paris	LOCATION	, and to some other eminent men , the very reform is due ; as they found the old Esperanto too full of crudities , cacophonies , and illogicalities , to admit of their endorsing it finally as an international auxiliary language .

		The contributor , speaking as self-styled advocate of the `` new generation '' -LRB- whatever he may mean by that -RRB- , pleads for the stability of an artificial language against the reform attempts of `` a band of childish malcon - tents . ''

		This childish band -LRB- see the names above -RRB- has given to Esperanto the firm principles without which it would be , and was heretofore , resting on sand , and remained at the mercy of any competent critic .

		In its simplified and corrected form , Esperanto is no longer an arbitrary mixture of Romance , Teutonic ,
Slavonic	ORGANIZATION	, and Utopian -LRB- that is , freely invented -RRB- roots , but it obeys the law of maximum internationality .

		Instead of copying in a slavish way the capricious and inconsistent word-building methods of
Grerman	LOCATION	, it now has a set of rules for forming derivatives according to the uniform dictates of logic .

		Instead of forcing on printing-offices an alphabet with half a dozen accented letters which are not met in any , even the least important , language in the world , it can now be printed with the ordinary Roman alphabet .

		Instead of emulating the Slavonic languages in sibilants , and an infantine wail in diph - thongs , it is now as easily pronounceable and as eupho - nious as Italian .

		Instead of dragging along a system of inflections as severe as the dead languages , it has now been modernized by applying to it the simple common-sense grammar of English .

		Primitive Esperanto was published about twenty years ago by a talented young man of no special philo - logical knowledge and of no experience ; what unbiased examiner can deny that the Parisian experts have ren - dered a service to the world by placing that layman 's attempt on strong scientific foundations , and thus mak - ing it safe against the very changes from which the zealous correspondent professes to protect the coming generations ?

		Thoroughly wholesome , warmly human , im - failingly good-tempered , and finely character - istic are the '' Recollections and Reflections '' of that long-time stage favorite , Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, whose book , bearing the main title , '' The Story of My Life , '' appears after various complica - tions and misunderstandings that at one time threatened to cut short its serial issue before it had well begun .

		Reminiscences of the stage commonly have something of the glamour and fascination of the stage itself , and Miss
Terry	PERSON	's rich store of professional memories , covering more than half a century , forms no exception to the rule ; but her notes and comments on persons and scenes and events wholly extra-theatrical are also full of interest , though necessarily her chapters treat most largely of actors and actresses and her own dealings with them . ''

		A child of the stage '' she calls herself , her father and mother having been players before her , and her own stage experience dating from
1856	DATE	, when she was but eight years old .

		Six out of nine brothers and sisters who grew old enough to feel the compelling influence of hered - ity and environment took to the stage ; and three are still treading the boards .

		There were , by the way , eleven children in all -- which makes one marvel that the mother ever found time or strength to assume any other part than that of materfamilias .

		The manifest aptitude of the eight-year-old
Ellen	PERSON	for the stage , as well as her strength of character even as a child , is illus - trated by her heroic behavior in a painful acci - dent that occurred to her when she was playing Puck in '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' -- her second part on any stage .

		Coming up through a trap at the end of the last act to de - liver the final speech , she had her foot caught by a too-speedy closing of the trap-door , and a toe was broken .

		Nevertheless , when she had been extricated , she stifled her screams and sobs and went through with her part , even as many an older player has been forced to forget per - sonal agony and go on with the mimic scene .

		The child showed herself true mother of the woman -- and she had her salary doubled for doing so .

		Of certain malign influences to which all followers of the stage are more or less subject she thus writes in an early page : *

		One night I remember gathering up my skirts -LRB- we were , I think , playing * The Rivals ' at the time -RRB- , making a curtsey , as Mr.
Chippendale	PERSON	, one of the best actors in old comedy I ever knew , had taught me , and sweeping out of the room with the famous line from another
Sheridan	PERSON	play : ' Ladies and gentlemen , I leave my character behind uie ! '

		I know that this was very priggish of me , but I am quite as uncompromising in my hatred of scandal now as I was then .

		Quite recently I had a line to say in ' Captain Brassbound 's Conversion , ' which is a very help - ful reply to any tale-bearing . '

		As if any one ever knew the whole truth about anything ! ' ''


Charles Reade	PERSON	, who was the means of closing Miss
Terry	PERSON	's second interegnum and of recalling her to the stage a second time , after her second trial of married life and domestic happiness , plays a conspicuous part in her book .

		Coming upon her by chance as he was riding in
Hert	LOCATION	- fordshire , where she had hidden herself from the world , he abruptly offered her the part of Philippa in '' The Wandering Heir , '' at the
New Queen	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre , of which he was the lessee .

		A laughing acceptance on what she thought he would consider impossible terms -- she jokingly demanded forty pounds a week -- speedily led to an actual engagement on those terms ; and thus the theatre-going world was not deprived of its
Miss Terry	LOCATION	, before it well knew what it would have lost .

		She thus sums up her impres - sions of that many-sided man of genius : '' Dear , kind , unjust , generous , cautious , impulsive , passionate , gentle
Charles Reade	PERSON	.

		Never have I known anyone who combined so many qualities , far asmider as the poles , in one single disposition .

		He was placid and turbulent , yet always majestic .

		He was inexplicable and entirely lovable -- a stupid old dear , and as wise as Solomon !

		He seemed guileless , and yet had moments of suspicion and craftiness worthy of the wisdom of the serpent .

		One moment he would call me ` dearest child ' ; the next , with indignant emphasis , ` Madam ! ' ''

		Intimate memories of other and even more famous men than
Charles Reade	PERSON	abound .

		Here is a pleasant glimpse of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, in that brief time when Miss
Terry	PERSON	was known as ''
Nellie Watts	PERSON	'' : ♦ ' In the evening I went walking with
Tennyson	PERSON	over the fields , and he would point out to me the differences in the flight of different birds , and tell me to watch their solid phalanxes turning against the sunset , the compact wedge suddenly narrowing sharply into a thin line .

		He taught me to recognize the barks of trees and to call wild flowers by their names .

		He picked me the first bit of pimpernel I ever noticed .

		Always I was quite at ease with him .

		He was so wonderfully simple . ''

		With this picture of one poet , whom his young friend had no difficulty in recognizing as a born poet , contrast the following rapid sketch of another : '' That
Browning	PERSON	, with his carefully brushed hat , smart coat , and fine society manners , was a poet , always seemed to me far more incomprehensible than his poetry , which I think most people would have taken straight - forwardly and read with a fair amount of ease , if certain enthusiasts had not founded societies for making his crooked places plain , and -LRB- to me -RRB- his plain places very crooked . ''

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	rejoices that , although similar attempts have been made in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's case , they have failed . ''

		Coroners ' inquests by learned societies ca n't make Shakespeare a dead man . ''

		The boundless esteem in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is held by the writer , and her thorough familiarity with his plays , show themselves repeatedly in quotation and allusion throughout the book .

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	's quick recognition of living genius is again illustrated by the following paragraph : '' The most remarkable men I have known were , with - out doubt .

		Whistler and
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		This does not imply that I liked them better or admired them more than the others , but there was something about both of them more instantaneously individual and audacious than it is possible to describe . ''

		A good third of the volume has to do with Miss
Terry	PERSON	's connection with
Henry Irving	PERSON	and with the plays produced at the
Lyceum	LOCATION	.

		Speak - ing of Irving 's aloofness and reserve and his inability or unwillingness to form intimate friend - ships , the writer questions whether anyone ever '' really knew him . ''

		She believes that he never wholly trusted his friends , and she finds a pos - sible cause for this lifelong distrust in two experiences of his early days . ''

		From his childhood up ,
Henry	PERSON	was lonely .

		His chief companions in youth were the
Bible	LOCATION	and Shake - speare .

		He used to study ' Hamlet ' in the
Cornish	LOCATION	fields , when he was sent out by his aunt , Mrs.
Penberthy	PERSON	, to call in the cows .

		One day , when he was in one of the deep , narrow lanes common in that part of
England	LOCATION	, he looked up and saw the face .

		of a sweet little lamb gazing at him from the top of the bank ... With some difficulty he scrambled up the bank , slipping often in the damp , red earth , threw his arms round the lamb 's neck and kissed it .

		The lamb bit him !

		... He had another siich set-back when he first went on the stage , and for some six weeks in
Dublin	LOCATION	was subjected every night to groans , hoots , hisses , and cat-calls from audi - ences who resented him because he had taken the place of a dismissed favorite .

		In such a situation an actor is not likely to take stock of reasons ... The bitterness of this
Dublin	LOCATION	episode was never quite forgotten .

		It colored
Henry Irving	PERSON	's attitude towards the public . ''

		These are trivial incidents , it is true , but signi - ficant as helping to a better understanding of a rather enigmatic character .

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	's cor - dial admiration , esteem , and even love of her illustrious fellow-player , and the whole history
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJ ^ 48 of her connection with the Lyceum Theatre and her noteworthy appearances on its stage , are too familiar to the general public to call for further reference here .

		Passing on to the chapter deal - ing with
America	LOCATION	, where Miss
Terry	PERSON	made eight professional tours , we are tempted to quote her impressions of American women : `` Beautifully as the women dress , they talk very little about clothes .

		I was much struck by their cul - ture -- by the evidences that they had read fai - more and developed a more fastidious taste than most young Englishwomen .

		Yet it is all mixed up with extraor - dinary naivete .

		The vivacity , the appearance , at least , of reality , the animation , the energy of American women delighted me .

		They are very sympathetic , too , in spite of a certain callousness which comes of regarding everything in life , even love , as ' lots of fun . '

		I did not think that they , or the men either , had much nat - ural sense of beauty .

		They admire beauty in a curious way through their intellect .

		Nearly every American girl has a cast of the winged Victory in her room .

		She makes it a point of her education to admire it . ''

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	is , naturally enough , attached to the old ways and the old days and somewhat doubtful of the superiority of the new .

		Yet she wishes not to be thought a fanatical wor - shipper of the past . ''

		Let me pray , '' she ex - claims , `` that I , representing the old school , may never look on the new school with the patronizing airs of ' Old
Fitz	PERSON	' and
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	.

		I wish that I could see the new school of acting in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		Shakespeare must be kept up , or we shall become a third-rate nation ! ''

		Again and again the writer laments her lack of experience with the pen .

		But , perhaps partly because of that lack , her chapters have a fresh - ness and life about them that attract and hold the reader 's attention .

		Shrewd reflections and bits of keen womanly insight sprinkle her pages most agreeably .

		Speaking of some of
Charles Reade	PERSON	's early counsel to her , and her own pres - ent increased facility as an actress , she says : '' I am able to think more swiftly on the stage now than at the time
Charles Reade	PERSON	wrote to me , and I only wish I were young enough to take advantage of it .

		But youth thinks sloicly , as a rule . ''

		And again , of eccentricity she writes : '' There is all the difference in the world between departure from recognized rules by one who has learned to obey them , and neglect of them through want of training or want of skill or want of understanding .

		Before you can be eccentric you must know where the circle is . ''

		The book has a great abundance of appro - priate illustrations , especially portraits of Miss
Terry	PERSON	and of
Henry Irving	PERSON	in divers characters and at different periods of their lives .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Unite ^ iTATKS IN THE GAME OF ILD POI - , ITICS .

		* During the ^ nter of
1906-7	DATE	, the annual series of Harvaifl lectures provided at the
Paris Sorbonne	LOCATION	on ther ` Hyde foundation was delivered by Professor
Archibald Cary Coolidge	PERSON	, who , being a specialist in international history and politics , selected , very appropriately , as his sub - ject '' The
United States	LOCATION	as a World Power . ''

		Under this same title the lectures , liberally recast , have lately been put forth in book form .

		With the exception of Professor
Latane	PERSON	's ''
America	LOCATION	as a World Power , '' the volume constitutes the only attempt that has been made to present at length and in a scholarly fashion the part which the
United States	LOCATION	plays , and has played , in the great drama of world politics ; and though Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	's book is devoted predominantly to the decade since the Spanish - American War , it does undertake , as Professor
Latane	PERSON	's does not , to bring before the reader the whole sweep of American foreign policy and diplomatic history since
1789	DATE	.

		What is a world power ?

		And at what point in her history did the
United States	LOCATION	become a world power ?

		These are inevitable questions , but difficult ones to answer .

		Twenty years ago , the expression '' world power '' was practically unknown .

		To-day it is a commonplace of poli - tical discussion , though admittedly conveying often no scientifically exact meaning .

		World powers , as Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	conceives them for purposes of his treatise , are those '' which are directly interested in all parts of the world , and whose voices niust be listened to everywhere . ''

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	belong unquestionably to the category ;
Japan	LOCATION	probably does , or at any rate soon will ;
China	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	, the Argentine Republic may eventually possess such world-wide importance , but at present do not .

		As to the point at which the
United States	LOCATION	became a world power , there is the widest pos - sible diversity of opinion .

		Early in the year
1901	DATE	a foreign diplomat at
Washington	LOCATION	made the assertion that , although he had been in
America	LOCATION	but a short time , he had seen two dif - ferent countries -- the
United States	LOCATION	before the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	since that war .

		This was an epigrammatic way of stating the generally accepted fact that the war of
1898	DATE	was a turning-point in our national history .

		Whether the great change consisted in the pre - * The
United States	LOCATION	as a World Power .

		By
Archibald Cary Coolidgre	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		44 THE DIAJj -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, cipitate conversion of the
United States	LOCATION	into a world power depends pretty largely upon the meaning one attaches to the phrase `` world power . ''

		One school of writers maintains that the
United States	LOCATION	has always been a world power .

		Another holds that it has never been such , and is not such to-day .

		And a third contends that the dignity , and the perds , of the rank came only with the Spanish War and the acquisition of our colonial dependencies .

		Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	evidently considers the
United States	LOCATION	as approximating very closely the status of a world power before the events of
1898	DATE	, but as in any case clearly exhibiting that character since the epochal changes brought about by those events .

		The first five chapters of his book comprise a rapid but suggestive sketch of the fundamentals of American foreign relations as developed during the first century of our national career .

		Particularly note - worthy in a volume of this sort are the discus - sions of '' Nationality and Immigration '' and '' Race Questions , '' for these topics constitute aspects of
America	LOCATION	's world relations which are seldom taken account of from the present point of view .

		The space allotted to them affords evidence of the fact that Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	's book is concerned , not simply with diplomacy , but with the international relations of the
United States	LOCATION	in the broadest sense .

		Somewhat orig - inal , too , is the query which is raised in a chapter on the seemingly threadbare topic of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, as to whether this phase of American foreign policy is to have any bearing upon the relations of the
United States	LOCATION	with the Orient .

		Upon the territorial limits of the
Monroe Doc	ORGANIZATION	- trine , Captain
Mahan	PERSON	is quoted approvingly to the effect that ''
Europe	LOCATION	construed by the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	would include
Africa	LOCATION	with the
Levant	PERSON	and
India	LOCATION	, but would not include
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, nor the
Pacific	LOCATION	generally . ''

		This defi - nition , though admittedly arbitrary and not necessarily final , is declared to represent fairly well the present geographical limits of the Doctrine in the American mind .

		Obviously , the Americans , in forbidding Asiatic interfer - ence in the western hemisphere , can not fall back upon the argument of reciprocity which they apply to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The body of Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	's volume falls into four principal parts , consisting successively of four chapters on the Spanish - American war and its effects , four on the recent relations of the
United States	LOCATION	with the world powers of
Europe	LOCATION	, three on the dealings of the
United States	LOCATION	with her American neighbors , and , finally .

		three upon the relations of the
United States	LOCATION	with the Orient .

		The treatment of the vexed problems connected with the acquisition and government of our colonial dependencies appeals to the reader as eminently sane .

		Prepared , as the chapters originally were , for a foreign audi - ence , they undertake first of all to recount accurately the history of the Spanish war and of the colonial acquisitions , and subsequently to set forth , in impartial though not colorless fashion , the controverted aspects of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pine question from
1898	DATE	to the present day .

		The conclusion is that it is yet '' too early to sum up the results of American ride in the last eight years '' ; but for a clear and brief state - ment of the factors involved , one can hardly do better than read Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	's narrative .

		The most striking assertions of the claim of the
United States	LOCATION	to be a world power are those which have been made in the
Far East	LOCATION	; and probably most readers will agree that those portions of Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	's volume which are concerned with American interests in the Orient are not alone the most timely but also the most carefidly considered .

		Following an historical chapter on the
United States	LOCATION	in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, the author analyzes at length the rela - tions of the nation , fii ` st with
China	LOCATION	and secondly with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		With both of these powers , rela - tions are declared at present to exceed in intri - cacy and in difficulty , when not in actual importance , those with any power in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And it is also asserted that the position of the
United States	LOCATION	on the
Pacific	LOCATION	offers it greater advantages , and imposes upon it graver respon - sibilities , in its dealings with
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, than fall to the lot of any European power except
Russia	LOCATION	.

		With
China	LOCATION	the prospect of American relations is regarded as '' clouded , though not disheartening , '' by reason chiefly of the inevitable American policy of Chinese ex - clusion and the friction which is more and more likely to
spring	DATE	from it .

		With
Japan	LOCATION	, the out - look is also distinctly less serene than formerly .

		Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	, in speaking of American - Japanese relations , says : '' We may as well recognize that the two countries can never again be on quite the same terms that they were ten years ago .

		Their feelings toward one another may be of the most cordial kind , but both have changed too much for the old relation , which was almost that of benevolent teacher and eager pupil , to be possible in the future .

		The Americans are no longer the mildly interested spectators in the
Far East	LOCATION	that they once were , and
Japan	LOCATION	has outgrown the need of their tutelage .

		In the past they have applauded her successes , some - times without stopping to consider whether these would in the end be to their advantage ; and now they can
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 claim no grievance if her altered position gives her new interests and inspires her with new ambitious which are not invariably in accord with their own desires .

		Amer - ica , who has grown to be the rival of so many older states , can not complain when she in her turn is con - fronted by the rivalry of a younger one .

		The world is still large enough for many nations to compete without quarrelling ; but when the aspirations of one conflict with those of another , it serves no good purpose to blink the truth .

		It is saner to accept the situation frankly , and to try to see what can reasonably be expected on both sides ; for without such an understanding , a fair adjustment can not be arrived at . ''

		One may well wish that Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	's international philosophy were certain of univer - sal acceptance .

		It is at least comfortable to believe that the candor and logic with which he has written will not fail of effect wherever his volume shall be read .

		It is not often that a book is brought out simultaneously in three languages . ''

		The
United States	LOCATION	as a World Power '' has had that honor , appearing within a few weeks in English , French , and German editions .

		It is distinctly to be hoped that it will command the attention which the temper , per haps more conspicuously than the scholarship , of the volume so abundantly deserves .

		EARi , Y Spaxisii Arts and Crafts .

		* The publishers of '' The World of Art Series '' have done well to secure the author of '' The Land of the Dons '' to prepare for them a work on '' The Arts and Crafts of Older
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Probably no man to-day , not a Spaniard , is equally familiar with that country .

		Long a resident of
Madrid	LOCATION	as correspondent of the Lon - don '' Times , '' and now a corresponding member of the
Royal Spanish Academy	ORGANIZATION	, the
Royal Spanish Academy of History	ORGANIZATION	, and the Royal Spanish Academy of Fine Arts , Mr.
Leonard Williams	PERSON	represents to this generation , as
Richard Ford	PERSON	did to the last , the chief English authority upon Spanish life and customs .

		The present material could have been gathered only by one thoroughly conversant with the Spanish language and intimately acquainted with the libraries , public and private art collections , and the people themselves .

		Considered mathematically , the three vol - umes contain 834 pages , 173 full-page plates , and 97 titles of books consulted .

		Volume for volume the first is the best .

		In it the author • The Arts and Crafts of

		In three volumes .

		Illustrated .


Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		discusses gold , silver , and jewel work , iron work , bronzes , and arms .

		Here he shows himself at home , giving us the interesting results of long study under most favorable advantages .

		In the second and third volimies , which treat of furniture , ivories , pottery , glass , and textile fabrics , he quotes largely from Spanish and French authorities , accompanying his transla - tions however with a valuable running com - mentary .

		Surely a man may be excused for not showing the same degree of intimacy with all the crafts , from iron to lace ; while inasmuch as almost nothing has been published until now in English upon Spanish craftsmanship , the attempt to spread over the whole ground should not be censured too severely .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	traces the history of each craft , and gives descriptions and photographs of its earliest and most important examples .

		Gold and silver objects , owing to their durability and the care given to their preservation , furnish some of the oldest specimens of the skill and taste of early craftsmen .

		Visigothic crowns stiU exist which date back to the seventh cen - tury .

		Many royal treasures of later ages , caskets , table ornaments , custodia , crosses , and altars have been guarded in private palaces or in those great storehouses the cathedrals .

		Often the delicacy of form or decoration proves the workmanship to be of greater value than the precious material .

		The names , dates , and spe - cialties of the most celebrated craftsmen make an interesting catalogue , but the list dwindles with the expulsion of the Moors and the dis - covery of
America	LOCATION	.

		By the time that the gold and silver of the
New World	LOCATION	began to pour into
Seville	LOCATION	the whole country was in an impoverished state and had lost her best native craftsmen . ''

		Foreign artificers in consequence -LRB- parti - cularly after the royal pragmatic of
1628	DATE	encouraging their immigration -RRB- , attracted by the treasure fleets that anchored in the bay of
Cadiz	LOCATION	, came trooping into
Spain	LOCATION	and filled their pockets from the national purse , fashioning , in return for money which they husbanded and sent abroad , luxurious gold and silver objects that were merely destined to stagnate within her churches and cathedrals . ''

		A century later for - tunes were everywhere spent in luxurious dis - play , the very pies at banquets being washed with gold or silver .

		It is to this period that we owe some of the finest treasures preserved to-day .

		An inventory of the ducal house of Albu - querque is quoted , showing fourteen hundred dozen plates , with a corresponding number of gold and silver cups , bowls , trenchers , salt - 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, cellars , and spoons , also a mighty sideboard mounted by forty silver stairs .

		This love of lavish display , and the satisfaction of it made possible by the sudden great wealth from
America	LOCATION	, together with the Spanish tenacity in preserving what is old , make
Spain	LOCATION	a more profitable field of study than many a more pro- gressive country .

		In iron work the splendid rejas or griRs are among the glories of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	gives as much space as is possible in a work of this character to the subject , which really requires a book to itself .

		Unfortunately , views of but two of these fine screens are given , -- those of
Seville	LOCATION	and
Granada	LOCATION	, the latter , enclos - ing the tombs of Ferdinand and
Isabella	LOCATION	, being a familiar picture to English readers .

		The chapter on arms is an excellent one .

		Into it the author has put his best work , while at the same time he has a most fruitful subject .

		He says : '' Lovers of the old-time crafts approach a fertile field in Spanish arms ; for truly with this war-worn land the sword and spear , obsti - nately substituted for the plough , seem to have grown wellnigh into her regular implements of daily bread-winning ; and from long before the age of written chronicle her soil was planted with innumerable weapons of her wrangling tribesmen . ''

		Lovers of the Poem of the Cid will be pleased with the picture of a beautiful adarga from the
Royal Armory	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	states that the supposed Coladu preserved in the same collection reaUy dates from the thir - teenth century , and can therefore never have been the sword of the famous Campeador .

		The general reader will be somewhat surprised at the following information : '' The Royal Armoury at
Madrid	LOCATION	is often thought by foreigners to con - tain a representative collection of the arms , offen - sive and defensive , used by the Spanish people through all their mediaeval and post-mediaeval history .

		This is not so .

		Although it is the choicest and the richest gallery in
Europe	LOCATION	, the Armeria Real was formed almost entirely from the cdmaras de armas or private armouries of Charles the Fifth and of his son , and is , as Melida describes it , ' a splendid gallery of royal arms , ' dating , with very few exceptions , from the sixteenth century . ''

		The term furniture has been construed with siiflftcient liberality to include doors , doorways , choir-stalls , altar-screens , wood statues , and wood carving of all sorts .

		Perhaps the most typically Spanish article is the arcon or chest , of which seven classes are described .

		Respecting the Cid 's coffer in the
Cathedral	LOCATION	at Burgos the author leaves us our illusion , saying : '' It is certain that the archives of the cathedral have been deposited in this chest for many centuries .

		Evidently , too , it dates from about the lifetime of the Cid , while the rings with which it is fitted show it to have been a kind of trunk intended to be carried on the backs of sumpter-mules or horses . ''

		Throughout the book many side-lights are thrown upon the customs and daily life of older
Spain	LOCATION	by means of excerpts from chronicles , fueros , inventories , and municipal ordinances .

		The strict regulations governing the manufac - ture of various articles are quoted , and the dis - astrous legislation which resulted in the decrease of looms at
Granada	LOCATION	from fifteen thousand to six hundred is reviewed .

		The list of these sources and of the printed articles and books consulted forms one of the most important por - tions of the work .

		Indeed , this bibliography , together with the photographic plates , would alone have been well worth publishing .

		The plates are without exception excellent , being also refreshingly new and unfamiliar .

		They receive an added value by being labeled with the name of the collection in which the objects may be found , and together form a Spanish Musee de
Cluny	LOCATION	containing the gems of Spanish crafts - manship from the beginning .


George Griffin Brownell	PERSON	.

		Thjs Youth op Mirabeau .

		* It is rare that an American scholar ventures to undertake a work like Professor Fling 's ''
Mirabeau	PERSON	and the French Revolution , '' for he realizes that an adequate examination of the material , much of which is still in the manu - script collections of public and private archives , implies a prolonged residence abroad or repeated journeys across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The law of neces - sity has , therefore , forced American historical writing to cultivate alaiost exclusively the field of American history , and has left the general reader dependent upon '' importations '' for the knowledge he is to gain of European history , save as this may be found in manuals and brief biographies .

		Professor Fling should be credited with the courage of his undertaking .

		It has been truly a work of '' longue haleine , '' for he chose his subject twenty years ago , when he was a student in
Leipsic	LOCATION	.

		At that time neither the biography by Stern nor that by the Lomenies , *

University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	.

		In three volumes .

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 father and son , had appeared .

		The publication of these biographies has not lessened the im - portance of this contribution , for there does not yet exist in English an adequate treatment of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Professor Fling has entitled his work ''
Mirabeau	PERSON	and the French Revolu - tion , '' because he intends to deal with the Revolution also , at least so far as it is involved in the life of its greatest statesman .

		The seri - ous student of this period will find his discussion of the value of the - manuscript material , and of the printed books , especially opportune and instructive .

		It is characteristic of the thor - oughly workmanlike quality of the book .

		The first of the three volumes covers
Mira	PERSON	- beau 's life up to his imprisonment at the Chateau d'lf ,
September 20 , 1774	DATE	, by virtue of a lettre de cachet which that pecidiar '' Friend of Men , '' his father , had procured from the government .

		Mirabeau was twenty-five years old , and this was the fourth time a lettre de cachet had placed him under restraint .

		It is evident that he had already accumulated much perplexing material for historical investigators and psychological specialists , particularly for those acquainted with the phenomena of ado - lescence .

		Such a varied experience suggests that in the study of this period we may satisfy an eager curiosity to learn the foundations of that strange character so vividly illustrated in the first two years of the Revolution , -- a great intellect , boundless initiative and force , acting apparently without those ordinary restraints which we call scruples .

		In order that we may have the whole case before us .

		Professor Fling has devoted careful consideration to the career of his father , '' I ` Ami des hommes , '' and to that of his uncle '' the Bailli . ''

		Several elements of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's mature char - acter had appeared , Professor Fling believes , long before the end of this first period .

		He quotes from a letter which
Gilbert Elliott	PERSON	, once the schoolmate of Mirabeau in the establishment of the Abbe Choquard in
Paris	LOCATION	, wrote to his brother years later when
Mirabeau	PERSON	was visiting him . ''

		Mirabeau , '' says this letter , '' although considerably ripened in abilities ... is as over - bearing in his conversation , as awkward in his graces , as ugly and misshapen in face and per - son , and withal as perfectly sufiicient , as we remember him twenty years ago .

		I loved him then , however , and so did you ... '' This refers to a time when
Mirabeau	PERSON	was fifteen .

		Three or
four years later	DATE	, in the incidents which led to the imprisonment in the He de Re , other peculiarities of the boy and man appeared .

		After a love affair , with horrifying possibilities of a mesalliance ^ Mirabeau had deserted his regiment at Saintes and taken refuge in
Paris	LOCATION	, in order , from a secure retreat , to ward off by negotiation the effects of parental wi-ath .

		Incidentally he was moved to vilify the colonel of the regiment .

		According to his father , he opened against M. de Lambert a '' pack of recriminating lies , almost convincing by the force of his eloquent effront - ery . ''

		This marvellous gift of persuasive utter - ance , so little dependent upon truth for its effectiveness , had , said
Lambert	PERSON	, won over to
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's view of the affair half the city of Saintes and the province ; and
Lambert	PERSON	added , he is '' believed to have found in the city 20,000 livres that are no longer there . ''

		The mystery is where he got these qualities .

		Was it from the stormy race of which he came ?

		Were they the consequences of the unsympathetic and pedantic attitude which his father took toward the boy almost from the first ?

		Was it in part because at a critical time in his later childhood his mother was forced to withdraw from the unhappy home in order to make room for a mistress ?

		Professor Fling suggests that each of these things may have had their influence , but he is unwilling to do more than indicate the probability , for the references in the letters of the father , the principal source of information for this early period , are not full enough or sufficiently clear to enable him to draw a com - plete portrait of this strange youth .

		He has given special care to the history of the father 's attitude toward the son , tracing its phases with greater exactness than have previous biographers .

		Certainly no father ever spoke of a child with more brutal frankness .

		At ten the
Marquis	ORGANIZATION	describes him as bearing '' a striking resem - blance to

		Recent American Poetry .

		* Before turning to the consideration of poetry that is recent in the literal sense , a few words should be said of three recent collections , which give us in definitive form and arrangement the complete work of three of our most honored American poets .

		First of all , and published within a year from the time of his taking-off , we have the new '' Household '' edition of
Stedman	PERSON	.

		In this edition , which includes all of his verse which the author deemed worthy of pres - ervation , we find the contents of the old '' House - hold '' edition -LRB- omitting a few juvenalia -RRB- and of the '' Poems Now First Collected , '' besides seventeen other pieces -LRB- including '' Mater Coronata '' -RRB- of later date , and two fragments from Theocritus .

		These fragments are all that the poet left in shape for pub - lication of his long-contemplated version of the idyls of the three Sicilian poets .

		In accordance with his expressed desire , this new edition of
Stedman	PERSON	adopts a classified arrangement , in which the order of com - position is largely ignored .

		Besides the long poem , '' The Blameless Prince , '' there are ten categories , '' In War Time , '' '' Poems of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, '' '' Poems of
New England	LOCATION	, '' '' Poems of Occasion , '' '' Poems of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' `` Poems of Nature , '' `` The Carib Sea , '' `` Songs and Ballads , '' `` Various Poems , '' and '' Shadow-Tiand . ''

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's work gains greatly in effectiveness by this re-arrangement , and no mis - take has been made in adopting it .

		tained him amid the trials of his later years and the personal qualities that endeared him to all who had the privilege of his friendship .

		We will quote the closing paragraph , which tells us how the end came .

		`` Soon after the death of his wife Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	moved back to
New York	LOCATION	.

		He took an apartment up-town and settled himself for the last time with his beloved books around him .

		Here , in spite of loss , ill-health , and increas - ing age , he enjoyed life as only life 's inveterate lovers may , and at the end the gods were kind .

		There came three or four days and nights of unusual well-being and high spirits .

		The evening before he died some of his near relatives dined with him and his infectious boyish gayety was the life of the occasion .

		The next day , after a morning devoted as usual to literary work , he called up an old friend over the telephone and demanded that he dine with him , on the plea that his dinner was to be an unusually good one that night .

		The invitation was accepted , and he made gleeful preparation for an evening of the reminiscent talk that was his favorite form of entertainment .

		In the middle of the afternoon he fell without a word . '

		Give me to die unwitting of the day , ' he had sung : his prayer was granted , and for him who had fenced with death so long and with such gay oonrage the end came with one swift stroke . ''

		Also included in the `` Household '' edition , and well deserving of admission to that choice company , we have the complete poetical works of Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	.

		This volume contains no prefatory matter , but simply reprints , in the order of their original publication , the many small collections of refined and graceful verse that Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	has been producing during the
last thirty years	DATE	and more .

		No less than seventeen copyright entries are in - cluded , the first of them dating from
1875	DATE	, exactly a generation ago .

		It makes us realize for the first time how prolific a poet he has been , and also deepens our sense of the fine intrinsic quality of his work , both early and late .

		The third poet whose work now comes to us in collected form is the late Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	, and the pious task of bringing it together , and of providing it with the fitting prefatory words , has fallen to her friend , Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spoffoi	PERSON	'd , who bears a name equally honorable in the history of
New England	LOCATION	letters .

		The contents of Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's three volumes of verse are here put between a single pair of covers , and a few additional poems round out the volume .

		Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's memoir is the work of a devoted friend , and is written in the strain of eulogy , but so many other voices have borne witness both to the beauty of the poet 's character and to the exquisite artistry of her lyrics and sonnets , that even friendship may hardly be said to exaggerate in this instance .

		Certain it is that no writer stands higher upon the roll of our woman poets than the gracious personality which this volume discloses .

		The Rev.
James Vila Blake	PERSON	professes his poetical faith in the following sonnet : '' I know not what my soul hates more and worse Than the pale brows of whimpering poets -- they Who not e ` en love but must go ' faint , ' ' fall , ' say ' We sicken , ' ' pine , ' and ' die , ' in weeping verse .

		O fine-voiced harmonies , must ye rehearse These feeble folk , who swim or swamp in whey Like meagre curds , more thin than ghosts by day ,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 Or evening scud that caps of wind disperse ?

		What !

		must sweet words , fine vocables , and song , That link all men and mark mankind , serve them Who suck a jaundice from th ' inveterate green ?

		Out wi ' the pack !

		I love bards firm and strong : My soul doth void the pulers -- broods I 'd hem Like bats in rosy fogs , nor seeing nor seen . ''

		It is clear that the writer of these lines is no '' whim - pering poet , '' but it seems also that his love for '' bards firm and strong '' sometimes gets the better of his natural sense of smooth diction and flowing melody .

		There may be compact thought , but there is no poetry , in such lines as these , suggested by an old circus ring : '' ' Where be your gibes now , ' thou chalked mock , And thy heart-sick gags ?

		Art gone of thine old staleness ?

		And all the melancholy players , over whose paleness Were dabbed the lies of smiles and ruby stock Of health ?

		Yon old ring , like a ghost , doth knock At my heart strangely , with vehement love , and the frailness Of our mortal state stares from the painted halenesM On the tan where dizzy phantom-riders flock . ''

		Miss
Amelia Hughes	PERSON	, who has made the selection of Mr.
Blake	PERSON	's poems now before us , calls the son - net of which these lines are the octave '' a flower of perfected genius . ''

		In fact , her introductory essay rather repels than invites our admiration for the poet , and her hope '' that the sincerity of its intent may retrieve for him any gaucheries of an inhabile and unaided pen '' is a brave one in the face of her strained and unconvincing argument .

		Mr.
Blake	PERSON	's verse is also strained , but at the best it is worth while .

		As an example of what is the best , because the most unaffected , we may take the following sonnet : '' If I be questioned whether ' t be the day Doth follow night around the flowery world , Or whether night , with sandals dewy pearled Pursue the mom , that wooed will not delay , -- I answer thus : Firat tell me , which makes way , My love to me , or I to her , when furled The camping light 's gold streamers be , and curled With spiral vapors falleth twilight ray ?

		If ' t is my part to woo with will , hath erst Her beauty not pursued me , will or no , And natural the more as ' t is not willed ?

		Like day and night , a twain without a first , True lovers know not either follows so , Or either leads -- whom both one love hath filled . ''

		Mr.
Blake	PERSON	's lyrical quality may be exemplified by stanzas from his ''
January	DATE	Song , '' taken from '' The Months , '' his latest production : '' And O , if I shall tell , my dear .

		If I shall tell the time o ' year The time that giveth most o * cheer , And most 's our own And most by love is known .

		What shall it be ? ''

		The answer to this question is the New Year season , '' For 0 , th ' angelic snow , my dear , Th ' angelic snow , and ice how sheer .

		The ice that tinkles frosty clear .

		And frosty fills With frosted light the sills O ' the opening year . ''

		And O , the troops of nuns , my dear , The troops of nuns that white appear There where the picket rows up-rear , In rows where snow The rows doth now o'er-blow .

		And hood them here . ''

		And 0 , the evergreens , my dear , The evergreens that mock and fleer , That mock at storms , and shine in gear Of shining ice .

		That shining in a trice Berobes them sheer . ''

		Mr.
Blake	PERSON	's verse is singularly conscientious and thoughtful ; it is also strongly individual .

		It is comprised in five collections , printed between
1887	DATE	and
1907	DATE	, from all of which ''
James Vila Blake	PERSON	as Poet , '' the little volume now before us , takes judi - cious toll .

		It seems to echo , at times , the accents of such old singers as
Herbert	PERSON	and
Vaughan	PERSON	, at others , the more modern notes of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lanier	PERSON	, and Sir
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	's newest book of song , '' In Time of Roses , '' gives us thirty-five -LRB- Shake - spearean -RRB- sonnets , with a score of lyrics appended or interspersed .

		From work so exquisite it is difficult to select , and it is almost at random that we quote this sonnet with its song-commentary : '' The
summer	DATE	gone , and all the day 's desire .

		Thick in the field stand , ranked , the stately sheaves ; The woodland blazes with baptismal fire Of
Horeb	ORGANIZATION	's bush , an angel in its leaves .

		Up through the dusk upon the sky I gaze .

		Where flows the molten gold , while from it loom The silver cloud-ships of the windless ways , Among the lilac islands brushed with gloom .

		These colors all are love and memory 's own , This near , appealing pomp the
summer	DATE	wore ; 'T is wafted back on all the winds that moan .

		Heightened to brightness it had not before .

		The glories of Love 's morning , safe they are ; Evening shall burn them in her early star . '' ''

		The field wears more than glory of the year .

		Pilgrims , unseen , walk here ; Mortals who crossed it long since , still they pa.ss Over the kind , remembering grass , -- All they once in its smile went by .

		And , now , lapt in its pity lie . ''

		The moon wears more than glory of the sun .

		By her is death undone ; Forever from the unforgetting skies Downward she looks with all the eyes Once lifted to her , yearning so , In the sweet evenings long ago . ''

		In this collection of verse , Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	seems to us to have achieved a more even excellence , a closer approach to faultlessness , than in any earlier one , and his title to a high place among our lyrists is more clearly to be read than ever before .

		Says Mr.
Charles Sprague Smith	PERSON	, '' My muse , thou art a simple thing , '' and her service may be commended to many more pretentious versifiers .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's notes are nature - worship , patriotism in the good sense , social brother - hood , and religious aspiration .

		These stanzas open the longish poem called '' Unity '' : 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, '' By many patt & ^ an seeks for God , And can it be , in error 's maze All wander sJlve the few whose ways Are those our sainted fathers trod ? ''

		Lo , deep within its bosky glen , Bending in coy humility , The faintly flushed anemone Would fain , I ween , be hid again . '

		■ The ruddy rose , the garden 's pride , Unveils her beauty to the sun .

		Exulting in the life new won , Casting her chrysalis aside . ''

		The cereus in wondrous way , Uplifts her chalice pearly white , For , in the mystery of night , Wakens the force received by day . ''

		In varying forms , the life within .

		Bursting the bonds of winter 's night .

		To leaf and flower transmutes the light , When the moist
April	DATE	days begin . '

		■ So human souls will ever climb By separate paths the bristling peak , When yearning hearts with patience seek To find eternity in time . ''

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's pieces are simple , but they are not often marred by faulty expression , and his blank verse is particularly good .

		Mr.
Henry K. Herbert	PERSON	-LRB- or
H. H. Knibbs	PERSON	-RRB- , whose '' First Poems '' are printed in a small private edition , is , we are told , a stenographer in a railway office .

		That he has kept the freedom of the spirit , even amid such surroundings , is made evident by the highly imaginative and deeply felt contents of his little book of song . ''

		The Wander-Lust '' shall be our chief example : '' Thou soft , persuading , still insistent breeze , Hiding thy swelling breast within the sail That nods across the undulating seas , -LRB- Prow-kissing seas that lap the dripping rail -RRB- , Thou bearest from unremembered idle isles .

		Within whose harbors alien anchors rust , Sweet singing dreams that sleep beneath thy smiles And break , -- to wake the slumbering Wander-lust . ''

		The inward tears , the unavailing word .

		The uplifted tender mouth 's unspoken prayer , Are things to me unseen , unfelt , unheard .

		When the wild Wander-lust , with siren-rare Enchantment , sings my soul to pathless ways O'er fields where Hunger , Grief , and Terror ride , Pace with my pace , -- gaunt wolves of questing days , -- Must I , with these , explore the Other Side ? ''

		What shall I gain when I at last have found The secret garden hid behind the hill ?

		An unremembered grave in quiet ground .

		Or trail defined that lures to wander still ,
Till Time	ORGANIZATION	's essential ministries shall change This atom to diviner flower-dust That on the breath of God shall ever range His Seas , in soul-immortal Wander-lust ? ''

		If only this moving poem were not marred by the impossible rhyme at its close !

		Here is a pretty little thing that seems worth quoting : '' I am a miller of tranquil mind ,
Content	ORGANIZATION	, as my little grist I grind .

		The simple folk in our valley know That my meal is pure though my wheel is slow .

		God 's clouds loosed the water that turns my wheel , His sun grew the maize that I turn to meal .

		Though the toll comes scant to my measure 's brim , I am well content , for I grind for Him . ''

		There is a whole philosophy of life in this happy expression of a simple thought .

		Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	, in '' The House of Falling Leaves , '' shows himself to be a sonneteer of thoughtful dignity and an effective poet of occa - sions .

		His ode for the
Whittier	LOCATION	centenary is strong and sympathetic , as may be seen from its third and fifth stanzas , here reproduced : '' In the rough farmhouse of his lowly birth The spirit of poetry fired his youthful years ; No palace was more radiant on earth , Than the rude home where simple joys and tears Filled the boy 's soul with the human chronicle Of lives that touched the soil .

		He heard about him voices -- and he fell To dreams , of the dim past , ` midst his daily toil ; Romance and legend claimed his Muse 's voice Till the heroic choice Of duty led him to the battle 's broil . ''

		He helped to seal the doom .

		His hope was peace With the great end attained .

		Beyond his will Fate shaped his aims to awful destinies Of vengeful justice ; -- now valley and hill Groaned with the roar of onset ; near and far The terrible , sad cries Of slaughtered men pierced into sun and star ; Beyond his will the violence -- but the prize Of Freedom , blood had purchased , won to God His praise that all men trod Erect , and clothed in Freedom , ` neath the skies . ''

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, besides giving us his own volume of verse , appears also as sponsor for a sonnet se - quence , `` The Wounded Eros , '' by Mr.
Charles Gibson	PERSON	, and writes for the book an elaborate intro - ductory essay .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's sonnets number one hundred and thirty , and this is one of them : '' How sweet to me are these soft days of
spring	DATE	; But how much sweeter , did thy beauty bear .

		Like cherry blossoms o'er the flowering air , Its scented fragrance to me ; and did bring Some songs of love , like birds upon the wing .

		To tell me that my love , with thine , might share These lovers ' hours , that in the
spring	DATE	appear .

		And o'er the earth their efflorescence fling .

		Ah , Love !

		thy winter 's waiting hath well-nigh This heart of mine , for love of thee , so broken , That it hath scarce the power to beat to-day . '

		T were time , indeed , to compensate my sigh At last with Love 's unutterable token , That shall not with the seasons fade away . ''

		From this , and the other sonnets , we gather that the poet 's love is scorned ; else it would not be free to languish through one hundred and thirty sonnets .

		We are informed that the book tells '' the story of an oblation full of inexplicable shadows , '' which seems to be a fairly accurate description .

		There is little subtlety in the imagery , and the poet 's senti - ment is of the obvious kind , sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought rather than glowing with passion . ''

		Each in his Own Tongue '' is a poem that was printed in a magazine many years ago , and has beeu widely copied since then , although not always with

		THE DIAI .

		51 the acknowledgment due its author .

		It was written by Professor
William Herbert Carruth	PERSON	in a happy hour of inspiration , and bids fair to keep his name in the anthologies for a long time to come .

		He may , in fact , come to share the distinction of
Joseph Blanco White	PERSON	, whose memory a single sonnet has kept alive .

		For the present , however , we must think of Mr.
Carruth	PERSON	as more than a man of a single poem , for he has just given us a collection of some fourscore pieces , many of which approach in seriousness of thought and felicity of expression the one widely-known example which provides his book with its title .

		Rather than quote the familiar lines we will reproduce the stanzas called '' Dreamers of Dreams '' : '' We are all of us dreamers of dreams ; On visions our childhood is fed ; And the heart of the child is unhaunted , it seems , By the ghosts of dreams that are dead . ''

		From childhood to youth 's but a span , And the years of our youth are soon sped ; Yet the youth is no longer a youth , but a man , When the first of his dreams is dead . ''

		There 's no sadder sight this side the grave Than the shroud o'er a fond dream spread , And the heart should be stern and the eyes be brave To gaze on a dream that is dead . '' '

		T is as a cup of wormwood and gall When the doom of a great dream is said , And the best of a man is under the pall When the best of his dreams is dead . ''

		He may live on by compact and plan When the fine bloom of living is shed , But God pity the little that 's left of a man When the last of his dreams is dead . ''

		Let him show a brave face if he can , Let him woo fame or fortune instead .

		Yet there 's not much to do but bury a man When the last of his dreams is dead . ''

		One other example of Mr.
Carruth	PERSON	's simple and sincere workmanship may be given : `` A carpet all of faded brown , On the gray bough a dove that grieves ; Death seemeth here to have his own , Bnt the
spring	DATE	violets nestle down Under the leaves . ''

		A brow austere and sad gray eyes , Locks in which Care her silver weaves ; Hope seemeth tombed no more to rise , But God he knoweth on what wise Love for Love 's sunshine waiting lies Under the leaves . ''

		A fine sense of the essential realities pervades Mr.
Carruth	PERSON	's verse .

		He is an academic poet , but one whose sensibilities the academic environment has not deadened .

		Mr.
J. A. Middleton	PERSON	's '' Love Songs and Lyrics '' are pretty trifles which may be illustrated by * ' The Lost Serenade '' : '' I sang a song .

		Alas , the nightingale A-down the vale Sang too ; and as I told my passion 's pain He nmrmured his , and hushed my humble strain . ''

		I blew a kiss , on wings of love to rise Unto her eyes ; Alas , the wanton breeze before had pressed A dozen kisses on her snowy breast . ''

		I took a rose -- but , ah !

		her favorite tree Outwitted me ; For , kneeling like a saint before a shrine , He offered handf uls , lovelier far than mine . ''

		There are only a scant score of these songs ; the rest of the little book is devoted to an incident in dramatic form , '' Red Sefchen , '' which readers of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	will not need to have explained .

		This is the poet 's declaration upon the occasion of the lovers ' last clandestine meeting : '' As dusk to
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, as sun to flower , Aa star to some benighted wanderer , As cool palm-island in a sea of sand , As light to ardent seeker after Truth Grappling with Doubt and Error till the full Fierce fire of Trial hath refined his faith And made it tenfold purer than before : As celandine unto the lovesick bee That draws , with thrUls of exquisite delight .

		The honey-heart it covets .

		As the pulse To life -- so thou to me .

		Our spirits twine , And in one tender growth of mutual love Spring upward , bearing fruit of perfect bliss , Which shall endure when life itself shall pass . ''

		The consummation of this tragedy in miniature comes swiftly .

		Feeling herself disgraced by her father 's unhallowed calling ,
Sefchen	LOCATION	, after the poet has left her , slays herself with the executioner 's sword .

		Miss
Gerda Dalliba	PERSON	-LRB- if that is a real name -RRB- is the author of '' An Earth Poem , and Other Poems . ''

		The intent of '' An Earth Poem '' is , in the author 's words , `` to express in words Man 's needs , capabil - ities , and progress , accepting as a premise that , gen - erally speaking , his course has been one tending from the mere materialism of Nature to a more refined and spiritual outlook , as is the case with an individual turning from childhood 's idealistic pan - theism through the material of fact and divergent emotions towards the necessity of a formulated Deism , or the slow progression of the Mass by the care of civilization and cultivation to a penetrating view of essential needs . ''

		It takes a long breath to get through this descriptive sentence , and many of them to get through the dithyrambic outpouring of the poem itself .

		We are more than ever inclined to think with
Poe	PERSON	that the expression '' long poem '' involves a contradiction of terms .

		It is an amor - phous composition , in which nuggets of poetic dic - tion may be found imbedded .

		Here is one of them : '' If I go on , soul , what will betide ?

		Shall I grow weary of the weight of light ?

		I , who before was novice to the Sun ,
Shall Paradise	ORGANIZATION	to me seem dark with prayer And ecstacy the dust upon the streets Where the man angel , joins the hallowed saint -- And prophet , the diviner angel meets -- Where sin , like a pale woman nun , grows faint With too divine a beauty , born from tears ?

		Or on the
long night	TIME	's darkness , long and wide Become an essence which is spiritualized ? ''

		52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, These questionings leave us baffled .

		Miss
Dalliba	ORGANIZATION	's other poems are sonnets and miscellaneous pieces in about equal measure .

		Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	intro - duces the collection with a few ingratiating words finding '' a rift of genius in this ledge of song . ''

		But we must call the book the work of a nature at present utterly unregulated , from both the intel - lectual and the artistic points of view .

		The '' Out-Door Music '' of Miss
Ella Gilbert Ives	PERSON	is classified under six categories -- Birds , Trees , Flowers , The Road , Love , and Religion .

		* ' An
April	DATE	Birch '' becomes the occasion of this pretty simile : '' The breath of God is in the breeze And touches all the quivering trees .

		But one , in maiden mood apart , To hold communion with her heart , In awe-struck beauty now receives The heavenly tidings in her leaves : Resistless as the golden shower That entered
Danae	PERSON	's brazen tower , God 's sunbeams on her whiteness fall And life leaps up to meet his call . ''

		And here is `` The Cardinal Flower . ''

		no less charming : '' In dim and cloistered nook , Where slips a quiet brook , A stolid priest intones -- To liquid sighs and moans -- A penitential psalm . ''

		The pallid sunrays glide Across his vestments , dyed In Golgotha 's deep hue , And damp with chrism-dew From
Calvary	ORGANIZATION	's nailed palm . ''

		These songs have simplicity and grace , qualities often denied to strains of more pretentious flight . ''

		Mugen '' is the title of a book of verse by Mrs.
Fanny RunneUs Poole	PERSON	, and the word , we are told , is Japanese , meaning '' in dream and reality . ''

		That Mrs.
Poole	PERSON	can write tunefully may be evidenced by the subjoined stanza : '' O the heart , the heart hath seasons , The heart , memorial flowers , And memory wells like vesper bells To thrill the dreaming hours !

		The fancies we have cherished , The affections ' myriad springs , Reach out betimes in rippling rhymes To hearts who love such things . ''

		Several of her pieces are translations , among these being versions of five of
Heredia	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets , done with sympathy and intelligence .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		The anuouncement that the Nobel prize in literature has gone to Professor
Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	has stimulated interest in au author who has hitherto been little known outside of academic circles .

		One of his English disciples , Mr.
W. R. Boyce Gibson	PERSON	, has written a study entitled ''
Rudolf Eueken	PERSON	's Philosophy of Life , '' which has been published in
America	LOCATION	by
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	^ H J ^ ^ -
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's reasons for accept - confession ing orthodox Christianity are , as a of faith .

		matter of course , thoroughly charac - teristic .

		They are rather brilliantly set forth in his little book named `` Orthodoxy '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is intended to be a companion volume to '' Heretics '' -- affirmative and constructive where that was negative and critical .

		The reason for the faith that is in him Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	might briefly have declared to be this , -- credo quia impossibile . ''

		All other philosophies , '' he tells us , '' say the things that plainly seem to be true ; only this philosophy has again and again said the thing that does not seem to be true , but is true . ''

		And again : it is convincing and irresistible for the reason '' not merely that it deduces logical truths , but that when it suddenly becomes illogical , it has found out , so to speak , an illogical truth .

		It not only goes right about things , but it goes wrong -LRB- if one may say so -RRB- exactly where the things go wrong . ''

		The
Chris	PERSON	- tian 's creed is paradoxical , hence it is incontrovert - ible .

		This , amply elaborated and illustrated , is ` the substance of the book , and is exactly what a careful reading of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's previous works might have led one to expect .

		To some the very unreason of the whole reasoning will be delightfully satisfying ; to others it will be foolishness .

		Inci - dentally some sparks of truth are struck out in almost startling fashion ; as , for instance , the essence of insanity is not its unreason , but its reason : it moves in a perfectly flawless and unbreakable circle -LRB- a vicious circle -RRB- of unanswerable reasons , and can only be reduced to sanity by introducing an illogical element .

		Incidentally , too , some refreshingly frank self-revelations are made . ''

		Mere light sophistry , '' the author declares , '' is the thing that I happen to despise most of all things , and it is perhaps a whole - some fact that this is the thing of which I am gen - erally accused . ''

		And on his first page , in explaining how his book came to be written , he acknowledges himself to be '' only too ready to write books upon the feeblest provocation . ''

		The volume is evidently written currente calamo , and with little attention to the best order and the most concise form of state - ment ; but it is , on the whole , one of the best pieces of work Mr.

		, Perhaps the best thing one can gay A new poetical i ' - rrrMT rendering of of Mr.
Theodore C. Williams	PERSON	s trans - the uKneid .

		j ^ tion of the '' ^ neid , '' now published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is that it tempts to a re-reading of the entire epic , no matter how familiar it be already .

		Wherever we have opened the vol - ume , the smooth flow and graceful diction of its blank verse has beguiled us to linger , and to read a page where we had intended to read a passage only .

		The translator 's justification of his work is interest - ing .

		He says : '' My first experiments grew out of the exigencies of teaching .

		I thought it important that a class in Virgil should sometimes lay its Latin
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 58 by , smooth out its frowning forehead , and just ' hear Sordello 's story told . '

		But all the rhymed versions seemed to have a touch of the comic ; and the prose ones , of course , were in that mongrel , base-bred jargon of which a man would hardly care to own the paternity unless he were a translator of the classics .

		Even the most scholarly and elegant versions did not admit of continuous reading aloud .

		It therefore became my rather desperate practice to write out certain selected passages , both in prose and verse , in renderings intended first of all to appeal to the ear . ''

		This account of the genesis of the translation prepares us for a lucid and easily-moving text , and we could wish the school-boy no better fortune than to have his
Virgil	PERSON	in this form to read side by side with the original .

		He could use it neither as a `` pony '' nor as a lexicon , because the translator 's starting-point is the phrase rather than the single word , but he could get from it much understanding of the power - ful appeal which the poet has made to the cultivated elect of all ages .

		No brief quotation can do much to exhibit the simple charm of this version , but we will permit a few lines to speak for it , taking one of the most familiar of passages : '' ^ neas thus replied : ' Thine image , sire , thy melancholy shade .

		Came oft upon my vision , and impelled My journey hitherward .

		Our fleet of ships Lies safe at anchor in the Tuscan seas .

		Come , clasp my hand !

		Come , father , I implore .

		And heart to heart this fond embrace receive ! '

		So speaking , all his eyes suffused with tears ; Thrice would his arms in vain that shape enfold .

		Thrice from the touch of hand the vision fled , Like wafted winds or likest hovering dreams . ''

		The translation is truthful in the best sense , avoid - ing pedantry and fussiness , preserving the argument and the dramatic effect of the long speeches , and using a vocabulary rich in suggestiveness and emo - tional association .

		Either this or
William Morris	PERSON	would be our counsel to the reader , young or old , who should ask us for the best approach to Virgil by means of the English language , and Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has over
Morris	PERSON	the advantage of closer texture and a style more comfortable to the general ear .

		We had not supposed a new Virgil in English could prove so welcome .

		Factors in the Some eight years ago Mr.
Norman	PERSON	creation of the ff i i i American xlapgood gave US a work on the con - drama , temporary stage , which treated those aspects of the acted drama that were then playing a leading part in American theatrical history , besides presenting a critical consideration of current histri - onic notabilities .

		In `` The American Stage of Today '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Walter Pritchard Eaton	PERSON	has done a like service , giving a vital treatment of the drama in
America	LOCATION	as it is developing at the present day , and rescuing from unmerited oblivion records of productions worthy of a more enduring place than the newspaper .

		Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	's book is written in that piquant journalistic style which is cultivated through labor on the daily press ; and , while it is not characterized by the same Estays on Elizabethan dramatists .

		assimilative power as the earlier work , it is inform - ing to the student who feels an intelligent interest in the contemporary drama .

		It treats principally of those authors who are bringing to bear on the problem of creating an American drama the largest amount of dramatic skill , truthful observation , in - telligent reflection , and passion for reality , and are thus keeping our drama connected with life , leading our stage on toward better things by making it a vital force in the community .

		As a corollary , in considering the question of reality on the stage , Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	says : '' The world knows that reality is for - ever in the making .

		What we called real yesterday is unreal today ; truth is what we would have it ; reality will only be perfect as we shape it so .

		To deny the mission of the stage , one of man 's most cherished fields of aesthetic endeavor , in this high task of remoulding the world ' nearer to the heart 's desire ' -- the real world , not the make-believe -- to call it from the work for which it is above all other art-forms fitted , and set it the trivial task of aping unrealities , is to deny the laws of change and growth , to belittle the power of aesthetic imagination , hope - lessly to undervalue the worth of dramatic form . ''

		A new book by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is an event , even if , as in the case of '' The Age of Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , it contains little new material .

		The present volume is a collection , with slight changes , of nine scattered papers upon Elizabethan dramatists .

		Most of the matter offered was written from twenty to
thirty years ago	DATE	, and we have long wished that it might be brought together in book form .

		It seems to us , how - ever , that the present collection is less complete than it might have been made .

		If recollection serves , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's contributions to the English monthly reviews during the eighties and early nineties included considerably more work than is now brought to - gether .

		However , the volume is too precious for us to quarrel with because it is not bigger , and at once takes its place beside the author 's '' Study of Shake - speare '' and his separate volumes upon
Jonson	PERSON	and
Chapman	PERSON	.

		The subjects of his nine essays are
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Dekker	PERSON	,
Marston	PERSON	,
Middleton	LOCATION	,
Rowley	PERSON	,
Heywood	PERSON	,
Chapman	PERSON	, and Tourneur .

		They take up , one by one , the important plays of each of these dramatists , and discuss them with a penetrative insight and a certainty of judgment that no other student of the Elizabethan drama would be likely to equal .

		The discussion is , of course , impetuous and heated , and at moments unnecessarily discursive , but it has the illuminating quality which is the signi - ficant thing in criticism , and for which no weight of mere scholarship can provide a satisfactory substitute .

		That being the case , we may allow him without too much indignation an occasional light-hearted irrel - evancy , like the remark about '' such constitutions as could survive and assimilate a diet of
Martin Tupper	PERSON	or
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' or the playful comparison of Euripides to `` a mutilated moniey . ''

		The volume has a sonnet-dedication '' to the memory of Charles 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, Lamb , '' whose '' Specimens '' were published just a century ago .

		It is a tender and beautiful tribute , which no one has a clearer right than Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	to lay at the feet of the man who rediscovered the great Elizabethans for the modern world .

		person in order to be made the sub - jects of interesting and edifying discourse -- spoken or written .

		Mr.
Edward Sandford Martin	PERSON	, author of that alluringly entitled book , `` Windfalls of Observation , '' and other volumes , has issued a fresh collection of brief essays under the name , '' In a New Century '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		A score or more of topics currently or even , in many cases , perennially inter - esting are handled with adroitness and grace , and usually in such a way as to strike out some novel or significant thought .

		Even in his chapter on writing for publication -- a rather threadbare theme , surely -- the author is not altogether unsuccessful in avoid - ing the hackneyed .

		He offers a novel and perhaps useful suggestion in the following : `` A man who has been a fairly successful writer for a good many years has been heard to attribute his success to the exceptionally feeble quality of his mind , which brought it about that he always got tired of any line of thought he was expounding before the reader did . ''

		The not very lively topic , '' Deafness , '' is responsible for fifteen pages of matter that bears evidence of personal experience .

		Among consola - tions for the loss of hearing he fails to emphasize the appreciable increase in value gained by the remain - ing senses ; and in aids to intercourse he omits to include lip-reading -- which , however , is incidentally mentioned later .

		His style is so pleasing and so suited to his ends that one is surprised and even mildly shocked to find him using , wantonly and under no sort of provocation , the unlovely adjective `` dratted . ''

		`` Would '' for `` should '' is regrettable , but , alas , to be expected .

		A good deal of entertain - ment , and not a few pregnant and profitable sug - gestions , are to be had from the book .

		It may be said with no undue dis - .

		lr ; Tmdr ` P ^ r ^ g `` ° ^ `` `` t t ^ at the `` Theory of Mind '' by
Professor March of Union College	ORGANIZATION	will give no higher satisfaction to any reader than it did to its author in the writing .

		There is a certain novelty of statement , and emphasis of points of view that lead the author to regard the whole contribution as profound and novel and com - prehensive .

		All that can be said is that there are few types of mind affected by the spirit and the methods of modern psychology that will feel at all in sympathy with this form of exposition .

		It re - solves itself largely into a matter of terminology and emphasis ; and Professor
March	DATE	's attitude in this matter repels not alone because it is strange , but because it seems to distort and to offer for the most part only the consolation of a vocabulary .

		The theory , in brief , is that all essential human traits are in the nature of impulses and instincts ; that psy - chology must be written wholly in the terms of such instincts and impulses , and that we may use such terms as ideal impulses , home-building impulses , and other specialized impulses , to account for every phase of social , personal , or material action .

		All this is further incorporated in terms of a Monistic , hypothesis , which helps expression but not interpre - tation .

		In brief , the temptation is irresistible to apply to this set of doctrines -- not devoid of ability or insight -- the familiar comment , that persons who like this sort of thing will probably find in this sort of book the things they like .

		For the general stu - dent of psychology it will carry but moderate mean - ing and less conviction .

		Though not notable , the volume by Mr.
James P. Conover	PERSON	, Master in
St. Paul 's School	ORGANIZATION	,
Concord	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, brings the well - directed thinking of the schoolmaster to bear upon the larger interests of his calling .

		The general emphasis implied by the title -- '' Personality in Edu - cation '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- -- contains a timely and welcome protest against the machine-made pupil and the method-crammed teacher .

		The spirit of it all is sane , the perspective sound , the treatment judicious .

		The several factors of the educative process -- the teacher , the child , the school , disci - pline , studies , and the routines of work , play , and examinations -- are passed in review with a unity of consideration derived from a large and well - interpreted experience .

		A significant though not emphasized opinion of the volume is that contained in the supplementary chapter on the
College	ORGANIZATION	, which expresses profound disappointment with what that institution has been able to accomplish even with promising boys from good schools .

		That here again the absence of the personal touch and the contact with the really educative relations of life has much to do with the failure , is an opinion held alike by Mr.
Conover	PERSON	and by many who have been reflecting upon problems akin to his .

		Now and then he uses the lash of the foreigner to chas - tise some of the faults which he personally desires to correct .

		The American habit of bragging , and of regarding matters from the provincial standpoint , is thoroughly dissected and duly castigated .

		The chapters at the close of the work , on the signs of progress in this country , are full of optimism , and show that the destructive criticism of the earlier ^ chapters was not intended to end in fatalistic nihi - lism .

		It is entitled '' The Story of the
New England Whalers	ORGANIZATION	, '' and appears in the series of `` Stories from American History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The portions of Mr.
Spears	PERSON	's book which relate to the origin and conduct of whaling operations in colonial days are rather better than the later chapters which are principally concerned with the more complex and diverse features of the industry in the nineteenth century .

		The purposes of such a work would be better served by tracing the connection more closely between the whalers and the palmy days of Amer - ican shipping , and between the spread of whaling activities to the
Pacific	LOCATION	and the awakei ^ ng of Amer - ican interest in
California	LOCATION	,
Honolulu	LOCATION	, the
North Pacific	LOCATION	, the fur trade , and to the Orient in general .

JAMES L. BARTON	PERSON
Turkey	LOCATION	is attempting to carry out one of the most stupen - dous reformations ever undertaken by a nation .

		He has personally visited the principal cities in the empire , having travelled upon horse - back and otherwise many thousands of miles from

Euphrates Bivers	PERSON	, across
Armenia	LOCATION	and Koordistan again and again , and into

		NOTES 90 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 91 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 91 A LIBRAE Y SUGGESTION .

		The chief factor in recent library develop - ment , viewed from the standpoint of material equipment and the extension of facilities for reading , is undoubtedly that provided by the unexampled benefactions of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	.

		Like all good works , this particularly good work has been met in some quarters with grudging accept - ance and ill-natured criticism , but its positive beneficence is not to be minimized merely be - cause some captious people think the money might have been put to better uses , or because some penurious communities resent the condi - tion of maintenance wisely attached to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's gift of library buildings .

		Those who take exception to the largess thus generously bestowed usually do so upon one or the other of the above grounds , and their fault-finding , while it may properly take the form of an occasional pleasant jest , should excite only indignation when it is put forward in the form of serious reproof .

		The objection of the sentimentalist , to whom any benefaction that is not a charity is rela - tively ill-advised , may be the product of a warm heart but is not the conclusion of a clear intelli - gence .

		The fundamental principle of all wisely - directed effort to improve social conditions and provide real benefits to mankind is that consid - eration for the future is more important than concern for the present .

		Charities we must have , and do have in abundance ; most people , in fact , who conjoin wealth with philanthropic purpose , first turn their thoughts toward soup - kitchens and hospitals and asylums .

		The appeal of suffering humanity is so urgent that comparatively few philanthropists can resist it , and devote their gifts to the removal of the underlying causes of present misery .

		With this emotional bias so widely prevalent , charity is at all times sure of getting even a larger share than it should of the total of wealth that is avail - able for the amelioration of the conditions of existence .

		It takes both foresight and resolu - tion to apply to the processes of gradual regen - eration the means whereby many immediate needs might be speedily relieved .

		And yet nothing is more certain than the fact that direct 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, charity accomplishes little for the future , and that it tends to magnify the very evils which it would diminish .

		On the other hand , increased provision for education -LRB- and the library is second in importance only to the school as a means of education -RRB- is a sure means of helping the com - ing generation to a better footing than the present generation occupies , and the judgment that makes it is of all judgments the best - considered .

		Glancing at the other of the two chief criti - cisms of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's library gifts , it is easy to see that , just as no individual likes to have his philanthropies forced , there are sure to be many communities that will receive grudgingly a gift to which is attached the condition of a continuing contribution oh their own part .

		The community that adopts the fara da se attitude , and courteously declines the offered gift , may have our respect , but hardly the community that accepts it , and then grumbles about the new tax which it imposes .

		The acceptance , if made at all , should be made in good faith , and include an acceptance of the responsibility ; indeed , a gift that does not bring with it a responsibility is not likely to accomplish a useful purpose in any direction , philanthropic or other .

		Hence we think that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's condition is as wise as his primary aim of supplying the multitude with good reading ; and if the possession of one of his library buildings puts a little moral pressure upon the town that gets it , the pressure is of the right sort and in the right direction .

		Com - munities , no less than the individual members of which they are composed , are apt to be made the better by the spur of a little compulsion .

		This principle , which is the foundation of our political existence , always makes for stability of character and aim .

		It is always the part of wisdom to guard against temporary inclinations and the impulses of the moment .

		We did not , however , start out with the in - tention of making an elaborate defence of the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	libraries , which may well give mute but eloquent testimony for themselves , needing no apologist .

		What we really had in mind was a suggestion concerning the books that go into them .

		It is , in brief , that the donor should supplement his gift of buildings by occasional gifts of books that are worthy of being placed in the collections , and that would otherwise not be likely to be added to many of them .

		The purpose of such gifts should be not so much that of swelling the ranks on the shelves as of encouraging authorship in certain needed directions .

		Most of the books that go into a library of moderate size are fairly popular pub - lications , or publications of recognized standing , that may very well be left to make their own way .

		On the other hand , there are many works of high character that are too narrow in their appeal to belong to the average public library on any terms .

		But besides the books of these two kinds there are others occupying a sort of intellectual borderland between popular writing and the literature of specialism , that find the struggle for existence difficidt , and that would be mightily encouraged by a plan that should seek them out , give them a helping hand , and lift them just above the margin of commercial possibility .

		Books of this kind , that have somehow failed to get adequate attention from reviewers , and yet are highly meritorious , and would prove their usefulness in the small library , exist in considerable numbers , and it would be a praiseworthy act to make some sort of system - atic provision for putting them within the reach of more readers than they are likely to attract by their own unaided merits .

		To put the case a little more concretely , let us assume that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has a thousand public libraries in full operation .

		Let us then suppose that he entrust to a committee of ex - perts the duty of examining the current literary output , and of recommending , from time to time , such books as are found to be notable for sound workmanship and educational value , but which , for some reason or other , do not seem to be getting the support which they deserve .

		Books answering to this description are all the time making their modest debut , finding a few appreciative readers , and then disappearing from view without reaching more than a small part of what should be their real public .

		It is acci - dent or caprice -LRB- to say nothing of advertising -RRB- that largely determines the popularity of a book .

		Of two biographies , the one sincere and pains - taking , the other careless and sensational , the latter will have the satisfactory sale .

		Of two histories , the one scholarly and the other flashy , the former will not be the popular favorite .

		Of two collections of essays , the one frothy and the other clarified , the latter will suffer neglect .

		Of two volumes of verse , the one slangy or sentimental , the other expressing high ideals of beauty and conduct , the latter will not find enough purchasers to cover the cost of its man - ufacture .

		Now our suggestion is that in each of these typical cases , and in other similar cases , our supposed committee should discover the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 deserving book -- the literary Cinderella -- recommend it for purchase , and that straight - way an order for a thousand copies , one for each of the thousand libraries , should go to the publisher .

		L-The sale of a thousand copies more or less is a trifling matter for the novel of the hour , but it is a matter of life and death for many a good book .

		Moreover , the cachet given a book by thus singling it out for approval would further advance its fortunes . ''

		Approved by the
Carnegie Committee	ORGANIZATION	'' might come to mean in this country what '' Crowned by the Academy '' means in
France	LOCATION	; no guaranty , perhaps , of any very large demand , but certainly the stamp of a distinction that would be highly prized .

		The system might profitably be extended to manu - scripts , since the sale of a thousand copies secured in advance , with the knowledge of their distribution to a thousand libraries , would insure the printing of almost any kind of a manuscript that might otherwise have to go begging for a publisher .

		The successful working of the plan which we have proposed woidd , of course , depend upon the good judgment of the committee entrusted with the delicate task of selection , and upon the authority with which it could appeal to the public .

		Probably the safest course that could be taken would be to place the whole matter in the hands of the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	, with full power to examine and award .

		The cost of putting this plan into effect woidd not be great .

		In comparison with Mr.
Car	PERSON	- negie 's huge expenditures for library buildings , it would be inconsiderable .

		Fifty thousand dollars a year applied to this purpose would enrich neither publisher nor author beyond the dreams of avarice , but it would provide for the publication or the encouragement of perhaps fifty volumes of good literature upon conditions that would at least protect the former from loss and cheer the heart of the latter in better than pecuniary fashion .

		It would also add fifty books to the shelves of every library in the
Carnegie	LOCATION	system ; and they would be books profitable for instruction and the elevation of taste .

		Objectors will doubtless urge that our suggestion is too artificial and academic , to which we can reply only by saying that we believe in the academic idea -LRB- despite its '' forty-first chairs '' and other miscalculations -RRB- , and that the policy of encourag - ing good work by artificial stimuli has on the whole thoroughly justified itself in the annals of mankind .

		GLEANINGS FROM THE LIBRARY PRESS OF
1908	DATE	* The most significant change in the character of the professional library press during the past few years , at least in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, is the par - ticular emphasis laid on questions of Extension , -- how to reach the various classes of readers , how to give the library its proper place in the community , and the relegation to the background of the more technical questions of cataloguing and classification , the disappearance even of the minutiae of library technique , the renewed emphasis on the book itself .

		-LRB- See in this connection Mr.
Koopman	PERSON	's articles in '' Public Libraries '' : '' Lest We Forget , in the Mul - titude of Books , the Few Great Books . '' -RRB-

		The question of open access to the shelves , once vehe - mently discussed on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, is the subject of only four papers , two American and two English , none of them particularly significant .

		The fiction problem , though the subject of only two or three papers , still attracts , and the last word has not yet been said ; the same is true of the problem of the children , which seems on the way to be rele - gated to its proper dimensions .

		Cooperation in cataloguing having been solved , at least in
America	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, the larger question of inter-library loans enters the field again .

		The interest in for - eign affairs is reasonably lively in this country and in
Germany	LOCATION	, while
England	LOCATION	takes on the role of greater self-satisfaction , which is shown in the few cases where American conditions are incidentally touched upon .

		* The following survey of the main articles in two American library periodicals -LRB- `` Library Journal '' and '' Public Libraries '' -RRB- , two English -LRB- ' ' Library Association Record '' and Library World '' -RRB- , and two German -LRB- '' Zentralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen '' and ``

P.L.	LOCATION	: 3 -- L. W. 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Turning now to the individual articles , we find , naturally enough , the most significant to be those dealing with extension of the work and influence of the library .

		Easily first in importance under this head is Professor
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	's address at the
Lake George	LOCATION	meeting , -- '' Library Work for Rural Communities '' -LRB- L. J. ,
Oct.	DATE	-RRB- .

		Here are new prob - lems presented in a forceful and attractive way , and the work of libraries put in relation with the whole movement to improve rural conditions .

		The partic - ular message of Professor
Bailey	PERSON	we find in the statement that while '' to a large extent the effect of library work is to cause persons to read for en - tertainment , '' the needs of the countryman are different .

		He is , consciously or .

		not , a fatalist . ''

		His work is largely in the presence of the elemental forces of nature . ''

		This develops in him either '' a complacent and joyful resignation '' or `` a species of rebellion which leads to a hopeless and pes - simistic outlook on life . '' ''

		The countryman , '' therefore , '' needs to read for courage . ''

		It is sig - nificant that the rural problem has been touched in
England	LOCATION	also , in the address before the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Brighton	LOCATION	by its President , Mr.
C. Thomas-Stanford	PERSON	-LRB- L. A. R. ,
Sept.	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		To make country life attractive to men and women '' emanci - pated by education from the ascriptio glehce which was the lot of their fathers , '' is one of the great problems of the day , and one way to meet it is to increase among them the opportunities for reading .

		A further extension of the possibilities for use - fulness of libraries has been effected in
England	LOCATION	through the cooperation of the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	with the
National Home Reading Union	ORGANIZATION	, an organ - ization of somewhat the same character as the Chautauqua Reading Circles .

		The
October	DATE	'' Li - brary Association Record '' contains a statement of the new developments of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, including the agreement between it and the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		A feature of this cooperation is the publication of a '' Readers ' Review '' issued by the two bodies , through which the readers in public libraries receive guidance in the choice of books and subjects for reading .

		Closely related to these phases of library extension are the questions of how to select the most suitable books for the public library and how to arrange them .

		The classification of fiction is not a new matter in this country , or in
England	LOCATION	; but it would seem that the article by Professor
C. Lausberg	PERSON	of Dtlsseldorf , on '' Die Gliederimg der schOngeistigen Literatur '' * -LRB- B. f. V.
July	DATE	-
Aug.	DATE	and Sept.-Oct . -RRB-

		, is the first serious discussion of the subject in the German professional press .

		The librarian of the
Dtlsseldorf Volksbibliothek	PERSON	has convictions of his own on the subject , and his articles are directed against adverse criticisms of the system used in the library of which he has charge .

		He claims that in a popular library the borrowers are looking chiefly • Issued in separate form by
O. Harrassowitz	PERSON	in
Leipzig	LOCATION	together with another article : ''
Allerlei Qedanken	PERSON	viber das Bibliothekswesen . ''

		for recreative reading , and the books should be arranged on the shelves so as to help them to select that which suits their taste .

		In fiction the reader is led in his choice '' by temperament rather than by intellect .

		The tastes are as a rule permanent . ''

		And the author goes on to cite several instances of highly cultivated men and women , by no means adverse to '' heavy '' reading even outside of their professional work , but who , when choosing books for recreation , select writers of a decidedly light character . ''

		And if a poor seamstress or a down - trodden saleswoman asks for books of the Heimburg and
Schobert	PERSON	kind for her lonely , tired evenings , let her have them to the end of her days . '' ''

		I have never , '' he says , `` thought much of the education of readers to ' higher things . ' ''

		Reviews of books suitable for popular reading have always been a special feature of ''
Blatter	PERSON	fttr Volksbibliotheken . ''

		Each issue contains a number of notices of current books , both fiction and others , short and to the point , enabling one to see at a glance the character and point of view of each .

		Besides this regular depart - ment , most issues contain special articles about well-known writers , estimating especially their work , as '' Volksschriftsteller . ''

		Among the writers dis - cussed during the past year we find
Gottfried Keller	PERSON	,
Heinrich Steinhausen	PERSON	, and
Karl Emil Franzos	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Ernest E. Savage	PERSON	, in a paper read at a monthly meeting of the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, dis - cusses '' Some Difficulties in the Selection of Scien - tific and Technical Books '' -LRB-
L. A. R.	PERSON	, Ap . -RRB-

		.

		He deprecates the lack of competent guides to the best books .

		He seems rather too much given to the cult of the books `` hot from the press , '' and presents incidentally his compliments to the ''
A. L. A. Book	PERSON	- List , '' which he finds to contain chiefly `` evaluative gush . ''

		Criticism of American methods is found in another paper in the '' Library Association Record '' for
June	DATE	, by Mr.
James D. Stewart	PERSON	, on '' The Cult of the Child and Common Sense . ''

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	opposes the introduction of exaggerated work with children from American to British libraries ; the story hour especially he thinks should be avoided . ''

		The library is primarily for the adult and second - arily for the juvenile , and if this is kept in mind the efficiency of the institution will gain , and much money and energy will be saved . ''

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	quotes with approval from the report of the
Examining Committee of the Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, which , he says , '' pos - sesses one of the most sanely managed children 's departments . ''

		It is interesting to find , in the
April	DATE	'' Library Journal , '' a paper by a former chairman © f the subcommittee on branches of the
Boston	LOCATION	com - mittee , Miss
Caroline Matthews	PERSON	, on '' The Growing Tendency to Over-Emphasize the Children 's Side , '' in which the writer says : `` Nothing has astonished me more than this new development in library prac - tice -- the placing of the child in importance before the adult . ''

		As chairman of the subcommittee on branches .

		Miss
Matthews	PERSON	has especial opportunity to study the children 's rooms and the work with children generally .

		She sums the matter up in this sentence :
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 ' * I grew to have a horror of children 's rooms -- as distinct from children 's departments .

		Intellectually , physically , morally , I believe them harmful .

		Neither can I see their necessity . ''

		If tendencies are apparent to relegate the work with children to a less prominent place , the needs of the workingmen and the industrial classes in general are receiving more attention .

		It is evi - denced , however , by the articles on this subject that appeared in the
March	DATE	'' Public Libraries , '' that American librarians here stand before a problem that is new to many , and one which they do not quite understand .

		Mr.
Sam Walter Foss	PERSON	hits the nail on the head when he says that '' we are not keeping step in this country to the new industrial music as are some of the European nations . ''

		His suggestion that the library '' mix a little masculinity in its over-feminized collections '' is to the point , and might be made to cover methods and surroundings as well .

		While the journals whose contents have hitherto passed in review discuss mainly the questions of everyday life in public libraries , the case is different with '' Zentralblatt fUr Bibliothekswesen . ''

		This journal caters to the workers in the large libraries , or at least to those of scholarly character .

		The problems under discussion are therefore to some extent , though not altogether , different .

		The ques - tion of local collections , for instance , which was presented by Dr.
Keysser	PERSON	of
Cologne	LOCATION	at last year 's meeting of the German librarians , is of interest to the workers in any public library , and Dr.
Keysser	PERSON	's paper should be read with profit by them .

		He is particularly competent to speak on the matter , as the City Library of
Cologne	LOCATION	not only makes par - ticular effort to coUcict books of local character , but is one of a group of libraries along the middle course of the Rhine which have joined together for the collecting of printed matter relating to their common district .

		Besides the proceedings at the annual conference of German librarians , this journal con - tains the papers read at the library section of the eighth
International Historical Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The general subject for deliberation at the section was Cooperation , -- union catalogues , inter-library loans , and the like .

		Dr.
R. Fick	PERSON	, the head of the
Bureau of Information	ORGANIZATION	of the Prussian Union Cat - alogue , Dr.
F. Eichler	PERSON	in
Graz	LOCATION	, and Dr.
H. Escher	PERSON	in
Zurich	LOCATION	, reported , respectively , on the work in
Prussia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Aksel Andersson	PERSON	of
Upsala	LOCATION	presented , after a survey of the present situation in matters of inter-library loans , a resolution , which was adopted by the section for presentation to the
International Association of Academies	ORGANIZATION	, which organization has lent its powerful aid to the development of direct relations between the libraries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The resolution expressed the appreciation of the section for the efforts of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, and presented some desiderata tending to a further simplification of the direct lending of books from library to library .

		The question of inter-library loans , which for some time has been dormant in this country , was revived by Mr.
W. C. Lane	PERSON	in his address at the dedication of the new library building of
Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	, the concluding portion of which was printed in the
December	DATE	'' Library Journal '' under the title : '' A
Central Bureau of Information	ORGANIZATION	and Loan Collection for College Libraries . ''

		It is a carefully worked out plan for the organization of a central office or agency for loans between libraries , which gradually should collect a library of such works , chiefly long sets of serials and other expensive works , as are not avail - able for loan through other libraries .


Aksel G. S. Josephson	PERSON	.

		AMERICAN LIBRARIES THROUGH AN ENGLISH MONOCLE .

		English and American library efficiency is a sub - ject for good-tempered and helpful , and also for acrimonious and futile , debate .

		By a well-known weakness of human nature , a weakness rather comi - cal than tragic , our own virtues loom large , and our neighbor 's vices even larger .

		The
January	DATE	number of `` The Library World '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- opens with a carefully studied and highly readable editorial com - parison of '' European and American Libraries , '' dealing especially with libraries in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The recognized fact that library workers are better paid in this country than abroad is made much of to demonstrate the greater cost of per capita service here .

		It is true that , like all new countries ,
America	LOCATION	has incurred the charge of lavish - ness and waste , and our library economy may not be the strictest economy in one sense of the word .

		We may , too , fail to adopt some of our English cousins ' library methods and reforms that are richly deserv - ing of adoption .

		But are we quite so blind and foolish , so arrogant and ignorant , as this English editor seems to think ?

		Possibly he has indulged the literary artist 's fondness for rhetorical effect , while cherishing none but the most cordial and friendly and admiring sentiments toward us .

		At any rate , here are a few of his most picturesque utterances : '' As a matter of fact , what ails the average American library invalid is simply indigestion , caused by lack of active employment , and having emoluments large enough to enable him -LRB- her more often -RRB- to eat pumpkin pie , clams , baked beans and canvas-back duck all the year roimd !

		The enormous sums frittered away in Amer - ica on unproductive and useless library ' activities ' have no parallel in
Europe	LOCATION	, where common-sense takes the place of hysteria in such matters , for example , as the treatment of children ... The mingled bounce and twaddle which garnish the aver - age American library report prove somewhat comical reading to those who really know what library conditions are in various parts of the world ... Thus we may have the report of the ' superintendent of the page 's brass buttons ' ; the statement of the marble polisher ; the special report of the torn leaf 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, department ; the statistical abstract of the steno - graphic department , and all the empty and costly parade which distinguishes these preposterous docu - ments .

		... In library matters American ideals are decidedly stale .

		Her methods were more or less standardized between
1878	DATE	and
1888	DATE	, and since then not an atom of progress has been made save in the piling up of immense revenues and the establishment of unnecessary staffs which have to attempt to justify their existence by launching out into equally need - less and futile ' missionary ' enterprises . ''

		Not an atom of progress !

		Far less , then , a molecule ; and some of us thought we had crept forward a good inch , if not half a foot .

		The article from which the fore - going excerpts are taken honors The Dial , among other American journals , with special mention ; but the charge that certain statements of ours '' are not only written with a most lofty sense of American superiority , but are manifestly based on ignorance of library conditions in
Europe	LOCATION	, '' seems a little harsh .

		It is true that in a recent issue we quoted Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	* s commendation of our '' finely systematized and organized libraries '' ; but he is a
Briton	LOCATION	, and we were too proud of his good opinion to keep silent .

		And we have occasionally alluded to a certain dis - inclination to cut loose from red tape as noted in some of the great royal or imperial libraries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , we not long ago -LRB- see vol .

		42 , p. 214 -RRB- commented adversely on our own libraries ' inferior efficiency as compared with a certain German public library , and were called to account for it in this country ; and we also -LRB- see vol .

		43 , p. 198 -RRB- took pleasure in chronicling the convention of British librarians at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, with approving comment on the unselfish devotion of British library workers , and regretful note of their inadequate remuneration .

		We were not consciously writing in a spirit of loftiness , condescension , or ignorance ; but who can understand his errors ?

		We are glad to be cleansed of some of our secret faults .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The classifying instinct is in some degree present in all of us .

		We feel that if we can only get the heter - ogeneous and confusing objects and facts and events of this bewildering world divided into classes and sub - classes , all neatly labelled and pigeon-holed , they will give us no further trouble .

		To systematize the uni - verse is to explain it , we are tempted to believe .

		This mama for classification , for making everything fit into a catalogue -LRB- preferably decimal in its scheme of divi - sion -RRB- , is very naturally , and not altogether improperly , encouraged in the training of librarians .

		`` It has for so long been supposed , '' writes Director
Wyer	PERSON	of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, in his current Report , '' that cataloguing is the backbone of effective library admin - istration , that this subject always looms far larger than any other in the program of either a
summer	DATE	or a winter school .

		In the former case , however , the excessive time given to cataloguing seems to be at the expense of the more inspirational features of the work , and the faculty is seriously considering either the omission of all cataloguing from the general course in
1909	DATE	and offering it as a special elective course covering about four weeks , or a considerable reduction in the time and work given to the subject .

		So many of those who come to a
summer	DATE	session are from libraries too small to find use for any catalogue at all , or at least too small for any but the briefest author and title list , or they fill positions which never have demanded and probably never will permit any or much experience in catalogu - ing .

		The omission of this subject from the required work of the
summer	DATE	session will give a very welcome increase of leisure time which may be devoted with profit to book selection , personal work with readers , the actual study of the inside of the books themselves , and the larger phases of library administration which are related to the community which it serves . ''

		The pro- posed change is commendable .

		Almost any course of mental training might profit the would-be librarian -LRB- so miscellaneous will be the demands made on his intelli - gence -RRB- as long as it does not nourish in him -LRB- and in her -RRB- the notion that mankind in general and library - users in particular are machines , and that the whole world , especially the library world , is wound up once for all and runs like clock-work .

		The
Public Library of the District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	is so much younger , so much smaller , and so much less important in every way than the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the same city , that few even of those interested in such things are fully aware how large and excellent a library it really is .

		The Librarian 's Tenth Annual Report gives the
last year	DATE	's circulation as over half a million , and tells in detail what is being done and being planned to increase still further the library 's usefulness .

		A piatter of general interest is touched upon in the following : '' It is gratify - ing to be able to report that the percentage of fiction circulated has been fvu-ther reduced .

		In
1903-4	DATE	, when no books except fiction were on open shelves for direct access , fiction formed nearly 84 per cent of the total circulation .

		Gradually during the last four years more and more books from non-fiction classes have been put on open shelves , and more and more help and guidance has been given to readers requiring assistance , with the result that the fiction percentage has been reduced to 65 .

		The new Useful Arts and Science room is an open - shelf room , where those classes are directly accessible to readers .

		... In spite of too frequent thefts from open shelves , the value of putting the people in direct contact with the books , instead of forcing their approach through a card catalogue , is so well attested by the grad - ually falling fiction percentage as to justify the recom - mendation still further to extend open-shelf facilities imtil it is possible to have the cream of all classes of the library directly accessible to readers . ''

		A life-like por - trait of the late
A. R. Spofford	PERSON	, who served for eleven years on the library 's board of trustees , and views , exterior and interior , of the handsome library building adorn this variously-informing Report , which of course bears the imprint of the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new head of
Harvard	LOCATION	, chosen to succeed President
Eliot	PERSON	next
May	DATE	, is a man already favorably known in education , as well as in letters and in law .

		Professor
Abbott Lawrence Lowell	PERSON	is the son of
Augustus Lowell	PERSON	, cotton manufacturer , shrewd
Boston	LOCATION	business man , and honored founder of the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		Born
December 13 , 1856	DATE	, Professor Lowell
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 76 has hardly more than begun his sixth decade , but has had ample opportunity to display his initiative and force as an educator , both in a term of service on the
Boston	LOCATION	school board and as
Eaton Professor of the Science of Government	ORGANIZATION	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a successful law prac - tice behind him , and known as the author of a two - volume work on governments and parties in continental
Europe	LOCATION	, he accepted a call from his alma mater twelve years ago and began there his lectures on government which have become so popular with his large classes of students .

		His success as lecturer and teacher has been attributed '' not only to his thorough grasp of the sub - ject and to his complete confidence in it as a field of study , but to his unfailing self-control in the class-room , his mastery of the art of speaking fluently yet with dignity ; above all , perhaps , to the wealth of apt illustra - tion and illustrative anecdote which he has at ready command . ''

		His reputation as a scholar and writer in his chosen field has lately been increased by the publi - cation of still another learned and illuminative work , '' The Government of
England	LOCATION	, '' a book worthy to stand beside Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's '' American Commonwealth '' as a foreigner 's lucid exposition of a great country 's polity in theory and practice .

		Professor
Lowell	PERSON	's administra - tive ability has conspicuously attested itself in these active and fruitful years at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, so that there is every reason to feel confidence in his wise and progres - sive management of the great institution committed to his chai ` ge .

		... The joys of an amateur librarian are enlarged upon by a writer in the
December	DATE	'' Bulletin of the
Vermont Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		She chooses to call herself an amateur , but is one only in the best sense of the word , -- an enthusiastic devotee of her calling .

		Before being drawn into the work , suddenly and com - pellingly , she confesses herself to have been '' like many others on the outside who felt that library work was simple , was work in a straight line , more or less me - chanical , and just with a daily routine to meet . ''

		But she soon , and to her increasing delight , discovered her mistake . ''

		There is , '' she declares , '' no limit for orig - inality and adaptation of well-known library contrivances and suggestions , and the outlook is so broad and the road branches into so many paths that it can not fail to be of vital interest to one engaged in it . ''

		In recoimt - ing some of her enjoyable experiences she says : '' Great pleasure comes with choosing new books , conferring with the trustees , ordering and receiving them -LSB- i. e. , the books , not the trustees -RSB- .

		In a large library where new books are without novelty , though of great interest in themselves , this joy is lost , and I am sorrj ' for the peo - ple who can not have it , and thankful that my lot was in a bypath . ''

		Only a desire for larger experience and for the training that comes with working under veteran librarians induced the writer to exchange her happy lot for what finally proved to be a different sort of employment in a great city ; but she writes : `` My in - terest in library work is very vital , and the large libra - ries mean more , the small ones mean more , every bookstore means more , and every working g ^ irl means more than they would if I had never had my place among them . ''

		Well for her , perhaps , that the ama - teur spirit did not have time to become transformed into the professional .

		When the amateur 's zest has departed from one 's calhng , it is time to step out and look around for another sphere of usefulness .

		When we have thoroughly learned a trade , that is sometimes the psychological moment for giving it up .

		The new historian of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Signor Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	, who has made so favorable an impression as lecturer and scholar in his visit to this country , and whose history of '' The Greatness and Decline of
Rome	LOCATION	'' is received with such approval , is a comparatively young man .

		Born near
Naples	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	, the son of a Pied - montese railway engineer , he studied law at
Pisa	LOCATION	and belles-lettres at
Bologna	LOCATION	, where he received his academic degree .

		He early began his travels and entered upon those studies of foreign countries and foreign manners that bore fruit in his ''
Young Europe	LOCATION	, '' a collection of observations made in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		The book was immediately successful and called forth many solicitations from Italian and foreign periodicals for contributions from its author 's pen .

		A leading
Milan	LOCATION	jottmal engaged him to write a weekly article , and the
Lombard Peace Society	ORGANIZATION	invited him to deliver a course of lectures on militarism , which were widely discussed .

		It was in
1902	DATE	that the first volume of his great work now in course of publication appeared .

		In person our distinguished visitor is tall and thin and ascetic , but with an imperious bearing that marks him as not exactly the midnight-oil-burning recluse which his depth of learning may have led us to expect .

		With the best years of his life still ahead of him ,
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	will disappoint us if he does not go far before he finishes .

		... Poetry and business mix about as well as oil and vinegar .

		Nevertheless there is here and there a busi - ness man who is fond of poetry , and , still more rarely , there may be found one who makes poetry of his busi - ness , which is a very different thing from making a business of poetry .

		The
Marblehead	LOCATION	seedsman whose annual catalogue we have already twice noticed with approval again greets his seed-planting , vegetable - raising , and flower-cultivating patrons with a yearly schedule of good things in embryonic plant-life , -- that is , with his annual '' Vegetable and Flower Seed Cata - logue , Free for All . ''

		It is a most welcome and cheer - ing reminder of the approach of
spring	DATE	, or rather of
summer	DATE	, with its pictures of plethoric potatoes and pumpkins , of bursting pea-pods and sleek-skinned to - matoes , of daintily-fringed carnations and thickly - clustering verbenas .

		But best of all is the retiring senior partner 's '' Word to Old Friends , '' with its con - cluding poem entitled `` At Eighty-One . ''

		Its four stanzas are all good , especially the final one : '' Happy the life that bears upon its wings All hope and joy , yet aims at higher things ; Takes from each passing hour its priceless share , And scatter 's Love 's rich blessings everywhere . ''

		To have preserved through the wear and tear of busi - ness , the spirit of this poem up to the age of four-score and more , and to have breathed something of that spirit even into one 's business , is no small achievement to look back upon .

		...
Robert Burton	PERSON	's bequest of books to
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, is now , after two hundred and sixty - nine years , duly catalogued and arranged .

		The author of '' The Anatomy of Melancholy , '' -- now not exactly a '' best seller , '' but named by Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	as the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours before his usual time , -- studied both at
Brazenose College	ORGANIZATION	and at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, but it was at the latter that he may be said to have lived and died , holding his ecclesiastical appointments by proxy .

		To
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	and to the Bodleian Library he left his books -- such as they did not already possess ; and we infer that the college 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, received the larger share .


Burton	PERSON	, too , as we read , was for a time librarian at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, which strengthened his interest in its library .

		English officials are admit - tedly slower than our own , and their library methods are more deliberate .

		Nevertheless two centuries and a half seems a long time to take for cataloguing a small collection of books ; but if they comprise all the books quoted from in the '' Anatomy , '' the collection can not be so very small , after all .

		There is a rumor , we believe , of a legacy or purchase of books from President
John Adams	PERSON	that has been slumbering uncatalogued , and so practically non-existent , in the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	for half a century , more or less .

		At the end of another two centuries perhaps it , too , will be available for use • ■ • The hunger for books in the country , where time hangs heavy and people go mad from pure ennui , is evinced by the reported circulation of public library books in fifty-eight places of less than 500 population each , in
New York State	LOCATION	.

		With an average population of 290 and an average book-supply of 48 volumes per capita , there was an average circulation of 6.5 volumes to each inhabitant .

		To equal this creditable record , such representative city libraries as those of
Utica	LOCATION	and of
New York	LOCATION	would have to increase their present circulation two and one-half times .

		Their per capita supply of books , too , falls very far short of forty-eight .

		These figures are cited by the
Maryland State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	in its Report for
1908	DATE	, the sixth year of its existence .


Maryland	LOCATION	is still a very poor
State	ORGANIZATION	in the matter of free libraries , and the results attained in the far larger and richer commonwealth , on which it may well cast eyes of envy , will not soon be achieved among its more scatter - ing and less opulent population .

		But the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	appears to be putting forth earnest efforts toward so desirable an end .

		... A MEMORIAL TO
LINCOLN	LOCATION	, which will have educative influence , has been proposed by the
Lincoln Educational League	ORGANIZATION	, an incorporated body with headquarters in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Funds have been or are being raised for the purpose of placing in the schoolhouses of the coun - try bronze tablets bearing as inscription the complete text of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , that brief but almost perfect example of noble elegiac prose .

		Read and pondered by the school-going youth of the land , what might it not , by its daily though unobtrusive pres - ence before the children 's eyes , effect in the way of mental and spiritual uplift ?

		Besides its noble thought , it would set a standard of concise and dignified expres - sion , and would probably be of more value to the pupil , first and last , than the irksome writing of a hundred themes or compositions .

		A more worthy method of marking this centennial year of one of the world 's greatest men could hardly be devised .


Europe	LOCATION	's ignorance of
America	LOCATION	has more than once contributed to the gaiety of at least one nation -- namely , our own .

		A German lady that we know of took occasion to comment on the causes of our Civil War by remarking : `` Well , how could you expect the North and South not to disagree , with nothing to con - nect them but a narrow isthmus ? ''

		And now we find a
London	LOCATION	weekly review printing a notice of Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's ''
Lewis	PERSON	Rand '' in which the reviewer sums up his impression of the hero as `` a kind of South American Bonaparte . ''

		How many more intelligent persons are there across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, we wonder , who conceive of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and what we in general call '' the South , '' as situated in
South America	LOCATION	?

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` IDO '' AND `` PIGEON ENGLISH . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In suggesting , in a recent issue of your journal , that the international language-makers turn their attention to '' Pigeon English , '' you overlook the fact that an international language should serve not merely for the primitive needs of travellers , but also for scientific inter - communications between the nations of western civiliza - tion .

		These nations have in the space of two thousand years developed a common international vocabulary , based in the main on Latin , and to some extent on Greek .

		Even German and Russian possess this Romance vocab - ulary ; but how much of it is to be found in the
Saxon	LOCATION	- Chinese jargon on which you wish to turn us loose ?

		A Teutonic world-language , such as Mr.
Molee	PERSON	proposes , is impossible , for similar reasons .

		An international language must be something more than inter-Teutonic .

		Moreover , the idea of having a union tongue between English , German , Dutch , and Scandinavian speakers , to supplant their respective native idioms , is the direct opposite of the desire to have an auxiliary tongue , the second for all nations .

		Only the systems that are based on international roots fulfil this condition ; and among them Ido , the simplified Esperanto , ranks by far the highest in regularity , sim - plicity , logic , exactness , flexibility , and euphony .

		No arguments of a personal character , such as those offered by a correspondent in one of your recent numbers , will prevent this fact from becoming more generally recog - nized , as Ido becomes better known .

		The fittest must survive .

		ESPERANTO AND `` IDO . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In The Dial for
Dec. 16	DATE	, some remarks were made by Mr.
Julian Park	PERSON	, against the already consummated reform of Esperanto by the system called '' Ido . ''

		Exactly why Mr.
Park	PERSON	should wish to discourage progress in that direction is not clear .

		He takes oc - casion to say that a previous note by me was neither consistent nor convincing .

		I beg leave to return the compliment , for Mr.
Park	PERSON	himself admits that '' Ido '' has taken all that is good in Esperanto .

		Therefore , -- inferentially and truly , -- the old Esperanto contains much that is bad , which , of course , does not appear in '' Ido . ''

		The latter is the first and only international language coming to us with the stamp of scholarship .

		It is not necessary to ascribe its authorship to the Marquis de Beauf rout , who is not '' a mere plagiarist , '' as alleged by Mr.
Park	PERSON	.

		I would like to ask any well - informed Esperantist where his '' kara lingvo '' would be to-day , were it not for the valuable propaganda work performed for it , in
France	LOCATION	, during many years , by that same
Marquis de Beaufront	PERSON	, who , however , is well able to defend himself .

		The quickest and best way to end the whole discus - sion is to leave the final choice of an international lan - guage in the hands of the public , where , indeed , it must eventually rest .

		The liADY
OP Holland House	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Beautiful , clever , imperious , -- these are the adjectives repeatedly applied by her contem - poraries to the hostess of
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	, who for forty years presided there over a coterie of the brightest and most distinguished men of her time .

		The glimpses we have had of this en - gaging personality through the pages of
Moore , Rogers	ORGANIZATION	, and
Macaiday	PERSON	lead to high expectation when we are offered the opportunity of hearing the lady herself speak through the pages of her own Journal .

		We know what the guests thought of her -- this third
Lady Holland	LOCATION	-- in her best moods and in her worst , when everything was to her mind or when her dinner-party went badly -- as dinner-parties will at times , even with great ladies .

		We have been charmed with
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's picture of that wonderful drawing-room , in all its stately grandeur , where '' the last debate was discussed in one corner and the last comedy of Scribe in another ; while
Wilkie	PERSON	gazed with modest admiration on Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's
Baretti	LOCATION	; while
Mackintosh	PERSON	turned over
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	to verify a quotation ; while
Talleyrand	LOCATION	related his conversations with
Barras	PERSON	at the
Luxem	LOCATION	- bourg , or his ride with
Lannes	PERSON	over the field of Austerlitz . ''

		What revelations , then , may we not expect when we are invited to another and more confidential view ?

		Shall we not learn what the hostess thought of her guests , as well as what the guests thought of the hostess ?

		Shall we not gain more minute details of this brilliant circle where every art and science was hospit - ably entertained and given a hearing ?

		But alas !

		the Journal ends in
1811	DATE	, thirty years before the time of which
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	wrote ; and consequently not one of the poets , essayists , or wits of his time whose portraits we had hoped to behold is even mentioned in its pages .

		This is the first great disappointment of the book .

		The second great disappointment is like unto the first , though not of equal extent .

		In these two volumes of about three hundred pages each , the political is almost as lacking as the literary interest .

		We do indeed find many allusions to men and events during the years when
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	was the rallying place for the Whig rebels , but all in so rambling and indefinite a manner that the Journ al can not be said to throw • The Journal of Elizabeth Lady Holland -LRB- 1791-1811 -RRB- .

		Edited by the Earl of llchester .

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .

		New York : Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		much light upon this stirring time .

		The lady of the manor is said to have prided herself on her command of the English language ; but her Journal , certainly , bears little evidence of pic - turesqueness of phrase or even clearness of statement .

		Moreover , it requires about half of Volume I. to reach the date -LRB-
1797	DATE	-RRB- when the writer becomes Lady
Holland	LOCATION	.

		When the record begins she is Lady
Webster	PERSON	, and although only twenty years old has been already married five years to a man more than twice her age and utterly uncongenial in every way .

		It is a pa - thetic story , based on a perfunctory marriage arranged by parents , ending in desertion on the wife 's part and divorce sought and obtained on the husband 's .

		At the age of twenty-two , Lady
Webster	PERSON	writes : '' This fatal day seven years gave me , in the bloom and innocence of fifteen , to the power of a being who has made me execrate my life since it has belonged to him .

		Despair often prompts me to a remedy within my reach ... Nature is assisted to relieve us in our diseases -- why not terminate those of the mind ?

		My mind is worked up to a state of savage exaltation , and impels me to act with fury that proceeds more from passion and deep despair than I can in calmer moments justify .

		Oftentimes in the gloom of
midnight	TIME	I feel a desire to curtail my grief , and but for an unaccountable shudder that creeps over me , ere this the deed of rash - ness would be executed . '' ''

		My tormentor '' is her usual form of allusion to the man whose name she bore ; and a most fitting one it is , judging from the sacrifices she continually made to keep him in passable humor .

		In travelling , if but one bed is to be had , the husband makes himself comfortable in that , while the wife sleeps on the floor and the maid in the carriage outside .

		Settling in a palace at
Florence	LOCATION	where English habits have not been provided for , and there are but three rooms with fireplaces , she goes without , while '' my tormentor has one , the nursery and sitting room the others . ''

		Most of the eleven years of the married life of this ill-assorted pair was spent abroad , in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Naturally , the lady writes a good deal about the places she visits , the works of art she sees , etc. .

		But her descriptions and reflections are not more valuable or signifi - cant than the opinions of the average young woman in the early twenties , and it seems a pity and something of an injustice to publish them in this day of eyes trained for art and familiar with foreign lands by much travel .

		Nevertheless , our sympathies are all with the young woman when , at the age of twenty-six , a divorce is granted , with the custody of her children denied .

		But the misery of this first experience of 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, marriage seems to have been more than com - pensated by the happiness of the second , when she became the wife of
Henry Richard	PERSON	, third
Earl of Holland	ORGANIZATION	.

		If anything more were needed to add to our admiration of this delightful gen - tleman and distinguished statesman , we should have it here , in the adoring wife 's Journal . ''

		Imperious '' as she is said to have been , espe - cially in her later years , there are few signs of it in her Journal , and never in her do - mestic relations .

		She seems to have been a tender mother to the ten children of her two marriages .

		Possibly it is unfair , when offered a peep at a lady 's Journal a century after it is written , to complain because it fails to fill certain gaps which , reasonably or unreasonably , the modem reader would like to see filled .

		And although lacking indeed in the ways we have suggested , -- being too diffuse at the beginning and too cur - tailed at the end , -- there is now and then a bit of happy characterization of persons of whom we can never hear too much .


Charles James Fox	PERSON	,
Lord Holland	PERSON	's uncle , is her great favorite as he was the favorite of all his contemporaries .

		Sheridan she does not love over much , and reports
Hare	PERSON	as saying that
Sheridan	PERSON	was always play - ing a game when with women ; his forte being at a club over wine , and in debate .

		She reports several of his happy retorts , however , such as his reply when someone ran after him at the theatre to ask if algebra was not a language .

		`` To be sure , '' said
Sheridan	PERSON	, '' an old language spoken by an ancient people called the Classics . ''

		She describes
Parr	PERSON	's vanity and Knight 's pedantry , and adds they '' fell upon a doubtful Greek word and pulled at it like hungry curs . ''

		Dr.
Davy	PERSON	, Master of
Caius	PERSON	, is dubbed a `` good-natured , tri - fling , insignificant man . ''

		Wordsworth she found '' much superior to his writings , and his conver - sation is even beyond his abilities .

		I should almost fear he is disposed to apply his talents more towards making himself a vigorous conver - sationist in the style of our friend Sharp , than to improve his style of composition . ''

		Much allowance has occasionally to be made for the lady 's personal bias , the editor sometimes bringing evidence from others to put us on our guard .

		But when all possible deductions have been made , the fact remains that to be a hostess of such power as to attract and hold the kind and the numbers of persons that gladly accepted her invitations to
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	implies social gifts of a very high order ; and social gifts are not so common as to be spoken of lightly .

		The editor says : '' She possessed to the full the gift of drawing out her guests .

		Conversation never flagged at her table , and however diverse were the sentiments of those who met under her roof , they felt that they were there able to fraternize on neutral ground . ''

		Two charming pictures of Lady HoUand , copied from paintings made while she was still in her youthfid grace and beauty , are given in the first volume .

		They aid us to realize some - what of her personal fascination , which , combined with '' as warm a heart as ever beat in woman 's breast , '' perhaps furnishes a clue to the charm that gave
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	its reputation and still surrounds it with a distinction shared by few other houses on English soil .

		MoLiERE IN English Verse .

		* Learning from the title-page of Professor
Curtis Hidden	PERSON	Page 's translation of Moli ^ re that the verse plays are here for the first time rendered into English verse , one turns with mistrust the pages until convinced by favorite passages of `` Tartuffe '' or `` The Misanthrope '' that the arduous task of rendering the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's rhymed hexameters into the heroic blank measure of the English classic drama has been adequately accomplished .

		So Gallic is the wit of Moli ^ re 's comedies , so replete with French subtlety are their lines , that no one of the dozen or more English translations made heretofore has suc - ceeded in giving the English reader a true per - ception of either the finesse or the purely Gallic humor in which they abound .

		Of these , the best , as Professor Page himself agrees , is that by
Charles Herron	PERSON	WaU in the
Bohn Standard Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Next in attractive - ness , the present writer is inclined to place the selection of seventeen plays made by
Katharine Prescott Wormeley	PERSON	; for , although the more complete translation by
A. R. Waller	PERSON	is accom - panied by the French text and many notes , and that by the late
Henri van Laun	PERSON	contains a val - uable introduction and appendices , the English of each of these writers is more laborious and stilted than is that of either Mr.

		THE DIAL 79 Page proclaims '' a storehouse of apt words and phrases which I , like all modem translators that I know of , have pillaged freely . ''

		After ac - knowledging the aptness of this early transla - tion and the sufficiency of Van Laim 's , it may be said without hesitation that Professor Page 's is the first to which the word '' excellent '' may be justly applied .

		Were it not for the fact that but eight of the plays are to be found in the two volumes in which his text is presented , '' defin - itive '' would be the word to qualify this alto - gether admirable translation .

		Since these volumes form a part of the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's '' French Classics for English Read - ers '' series , the offence of incompleteness may not be laid entirely at the translator 's door ; yet , when it is announced that in this series '' the best and most representative works of each author are given in full , '' either he or his editor should be held accountable for the failure to include among Molidre 's '' best and most repre - sentative '' plays '' L'Etourdi . ''

		The best it is not , assuredly ; yet it represents the metamor - phosis of Moli ^ re , the hack-writer of a troupe of strolling players , to
Molidre	LOCATION	, the master of the art of comedy .

		Furthermore , it is typical of the first phase of his development -- the time when his work was entirely influenced by Italian comedy ; when he had not realized that his duty was to attack the foibles and hypocrisy of soci - ety '' with ridiculous likeness '' ; the time before he had exclaimed , '' Let us cease to be Italian , let us disdain being Spanish , let us be French ! ''

		Furthermore , one notes with regret the absence of '' L'Ecole des maris , '' `` L'Ecole des femmes , '' ''
George Dandin	PERSON	, '' and , above all , of '' Le Malade imaginaire . ''

		Still , if but eight plays must be selected from the thirty-three existing , it is difficult to cavil at the choice Professor Page has made ; i. e. , '' Les Precieuses ridicules , '' ``
Don Juan	PERSON	, '' '' Le Tartuffe , '' '' Le
Misan	PERSON	- thrope , '' `` Le Medecin malgre lui , '' '' L'Avare , '' '' Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme , '' and '' Les Femmes savantes . ''

		Three of these plays are in verse , and to these one turns , as has been said , with mistrust -- not , be it added , of Professor Page 's ability as a translator , but of the possibility of rendering adequately in English Moliere 's alexandrines .

		Although in one or two instances verse trans - lations of important passages have been made , it has remained for Professor Page to render '' Le Tartuffe , '' '' Le Misanthrope , '' and '' Les Femmes savantes '' into English verse .

		Only one who has attempted the verse translation of occasional passages of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's may appreciate thoroughly the almost insurmountable difficul - ties in Professor Page 's path .

		These he has himself set forth in his illuminating preface . ''

		It seems strange , '' he exclaims , '' that in all these years no attempt has been made to trans - late
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's plays into English verse ... Yet should not the ideal of the translator be to produce in his own tongue a work as nearly as possible equivalent to the original ?

		And if so , how can he , handicapped as he necessarily is by the difference between two languages , accept the still greater handicap of the contrast between verse and prose ? '' ''

		When it became necessary to include ' Tar - tuffe ' and ' The Misanthrope ' in this series of French Classics , '' he goes on to say , '' I could not accept a prose translation as at all truly reproducing them for English readers ... The ideal which I set before myself was there - fore to say in good English dramatic verse -LRB- if I could -RRB- exactly what Moliere has said in good French dramatic verse .

		^ ' A praiseworthy ideal , yet difficult in its attain - ment .

		Indeed , so different are the geniuses of the two languages that the translator is met at the outset by prosodial obstacles in themselves almost insurmountable .

		Rhymed alexandrines have , as Professor Page says , '' never been good English dramatic verse and never can by any possibility be so . ''

		It is a metre ill according with the spirit of our language , and wisely he has selected the unrhymed pentameter measure of our own dramatic poetry .

		It was impossible , of course , to retain by this means the melodious rhythm of the original , yet , by using the five - accent iambic of our heroic measure , he has at once suggested to the English ear dramatic poetry , thus overcoming the greatest difficulty of all translation , -- to wit , the avoidance of foreign construction in the English rendering .

		Indeed , so thoroughly English is iambic blank verse , with its shifting of accents and occasional extra syllables , that the form itself conveys the suggestion of idiom rather than of translation .

		It is , moreover , our classic equivalent of the French rhymed alexandrines .

		Being the medium of all good English dramatic verse , it is histori - cally and dramatically equipollent to the French measure used by Moliere ; therefore it is the correct translation of that metre , the one above all others with which to convey the spirit , if not the letter , of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's rhymed verses to the English ear .

		The phrasing , too , is a matter requiring nicety on the translator 's part .

		It should be suggestive of the English comedy con - temporaneous with Moliere ; yet not so archaic 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, as to destroy the surprising modemness of the great Frenchman 's thought .

		Having indicated the obstacles in the path of the translator of Moli ^ re , it becomes a pleasure to state that Professor Page has surmounted them admirably .

		Nowhere does he give the fatal impression of translation .

		Indeed , so idiomatic is his verse , so suggestive of the English comedy of the time when
Moliere	PERSON	wrote his masterpieces , that , if one were to venture a criticism , it would be to suggest that it is too English .

		In other words , in '' avoiding all effort for ' poetical ' ornament , '' he has occasionally so '' wilfully broken up the too regular move - ment of the French lines '' that the rhythm suffers .

		A little more rhythm might have sug - gested more completely the French alexandrine gliding upon its classic course like a mighty river of harmony .

		Moreover ,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's verse is so singularly lacking in the imagery which is the charm of Shakespeare that , shorn of its rhythm , it is often too suggestive of metrified prose to be satisfying .

		But as Professor Page has so successfully avoided all appearances of translation , this criticism of his verse becomes so captious that one is tempted to apologize for having made it .

		Indeed , so acceptably has his task been accomplished that a just critic should only exclaim , '' Well done I '' In the prose plays , too , he has been so suc - cessful in his choice of apt words , so conscien - tious in his endeavors to avoid all Latinity , that they read like English comedies .

		Throughout them , he has used quips and expressions of the corresponding English period , and avoided Latin etymologies so thoroughly that they re - tain no flavor of translation .

		This is the highest praise that may be awarded a translator ; yet , while bestowing it , one can not resist saying that he has occasionally been too faithful to the methods of , shall we say ,
Congreve	PERSON	or Mrs.
Behn	PERSON	.

		For instance , when , in '' Les Precieuses ridicules , ''
Gorgibus	PERSON	, discovering the cruel trick that has been played upon his daughter and his niece , exclaims , '' Oui ^ c'est une piece sang - lante , mats qui est un ejfet de voire impei ` ti - nence , infantes ! ''

		Professor Page translates the passage in this wise , '' Yes , it 's a cruel trick , but you may thank your own foolish impudence for it , you sluts ! ''

		This rendering is doubtless suggestive of the restoration period of our drama ; yet Moliere , studied as he is in schools by young girls , should not be so restorationized as to have his Gallic epithet '' inf antes '' ren - dered in English by a word such as Professor Page has selected .

		Surely the unsullied term '' wretches '' would have expressed more thor - oughly the Frenchman 's meaning .

		Still , in spite of such occasional lapses .

		Pro- fessor Page 's work is a credit at once to his erudition and to his skill as a writer of English .

		To him all credit is due for an arduous task skilfully performed .

		Of the plays in his trans - lation it may be said truthfully that never before have they been so well rendered in our language , and that , in all probability , no suc - ceeding translator will surpass his admirable presentation of Moliere to the English reader in unlabored language .

		The book contains a comprehensive bibliog - raphy , in which the more vital works are indi - cated by asterisks ; furthermore , each play is accompanied by a scholarly notice in which salient features of its sources and presentation are adequately set forth .

		Professor Page 's work itself is worthily introduced by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, his scholarly prelude being a succinct biography of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes , like the others of this series , are edited by Professor
Adolphe Cohn	PERSON	.

		These three scholars , all mem - bers of the faculty of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, stand preeminent among
American Molieristes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is no small credit to them that so satisfactory and able a translation of Moliere should be the result of their joint labor .

		* It is almost impossible at the present day to interest Americans in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The Irish , like the poor , they have always with them ; and there is little desire to know more than that , like all foreigners , the Irish are here on a hazard of new fortunes .

		Excepting the fine verses of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, Americans have written little about
Ireland	LOCATION	more serious than good-natured raillery growing out of habitual holiday touring in that country ; or , if any more serious treatment is attempted , it shows a lamentable lack of acquaint - ance with the vital sources of Irish life and thought .

		Other peoples have found
Ireland	LOCATION	well worth their study .

		Even the English , from
Edmund Spenser	PERSON	to Mr.
Sydney Brooks	PERSON	, have not failed on the score of gravity in writing about

		THE DIAL 81
Ireland	LOCATION	to study the Irish mind in the only proper sources of such study -- Irish manuscript literature .

		Thus ,
Zeuss	LOCATION	,
Zimmer	PERSON	, and
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	have a lasting part in what may be , not only for Irish literature but for all literature , the discovery of a rich vein of poetry .

		It is to the French , however , that the Irish owe the salutary but perhaps thankless service of social and political criticism . ' '

		Contemporary
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' by
M. L. Paul-Dubois	PERSON	, a writer already having to his credit important works on social and economic questions , should be peculiarly acceptable to Americans who prefer a condensed survey of a subject rather than an exhaustive review .

		This work is the third important study of its kind for which the Irish are indebted to the French .

		In
1839	DATE
Gustave De Beaumont	ORGANIZATION	, with strict adherence to a cause - and-effect method of inquiry , revealed the social and political conditions in
Ireland	LOCATION	, when , under
Daniel O'Connell	PERSON	, the Irish were first emerg - ing into democratic consciousness .

		A few decades later ,
Adolphe Perraud	PERSON	achieved the dismal task of chronicling the aftermath of the Famine by a history of the Irish as emigrants .

		In writing of the
Ireland	LOCATION	of to-day ,
M. Paul	PERSON	-
Dubois	PERSON	had a problem not less complex than that of De
Beaumont	LOCATION	, and scarcely less discourag - ing than that of Perraud .

		For , in spite of many economic reforms ,
Ireland	LOCATION	shows signs of fast-spreading national decay ; the Irish , though steadily winning concessions from
England	LOCATION	, are emigrating in an unceasing tide .

		M.
Paul	PERSON	-
Dubois	PERSON	had , however , a peculiar advantage over his predecessors .

		There is in the
Ireland	LOCATION	of to-day an opportunity for a criticism fascinat - ing to a student of things of the mind .

		Dreary as the outlook is for an
Ireland	LOCATION	economically vigorous , the Irish are for the first time develop - ing a national literature ; they are creating , too , schools of painting and of art criticism which have little to do with the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	in
Piccadilly	LOCATION	.

		To solve the problem of a race intellectually active in the midst of material decay is well worth the serious study of a pub - licist .

		M. Paul-Dubois skilfully meets the difficulty of this paradox ; he treats both phases of it by a method of outline , summary , and report , rather than by discussion .

		He knows that the secret of brevity in a comprehensive subject lies in the large grasp , the inclusive sur - vey , rather than in minute amplification .

		His book is thus valuable as a compendium , an ency - clopaedic reference ready for the student seeking the original sources of Irish history .

		The use M. Paul-Dubois himself makes of these sources is instructive .

		He adopts De
Beaumont	LOCATION	's conclusion , which fixed the cause of
Ireland	LOCATION	's decay on an alien aristocracy , respon - sible for the whole misgovernment of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Pressing his search no further than this , he touches upon the main movements and leading personalities of Irish history , with a definiteness and vigor typical of the entire book .

		Irish mind and character are treated authoritatively rather than critically .

		In sketching the material de - cline of
Ireland	LOCATION	, resulting from confiscation of the land , the author is at his best .

		He knows how to make statistics illuminating .

		His esti - mate , too , of the
Irish Nationalist Party	ORGANIZATION	is dis - criminating , and vitally constructive as criticism .

		For these , and for an unequivocal sympathy with all the Irish still hope for as a nation , the author deserves the enthusiastic commendation which his translator , Mr.
Kettle	PERSON	, gives him in the Introduction .

		It is not with the spirit of the book that fault may be found .

		Its tone is perhaps too temporizing in treating of some phases of Irish life , but a frank heartiness to - ward the people written of is everywhere apparent .

		What one deplores is that the jour - nalistic plan of the book works ill to its most vital topic -- the regenerative influences now in progress in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		This part of the discussion is too vital to be disposed of with the brevity of a business document .

		It needed keen reaction to the material at hand ; an editorial treatment large , free , conclusive .

		Moreover , the Irish themselves offered ample help in what they are publishing every day .

		Fond as they are of flight and fancy , they are not disdainful of se - vere statistics , rigid facts , lashing self-criticism , to prove that if they can not survive as a race they at least understand why they are about to fail .

		To what extent
M. Paul-Dubois	PERSON	has contributed to an understanding of this impending failure , depends on how much his readers can amplify his compact resume .

		It is to be regretted that
M. Paul-Dubois	PERSON	's plan forbade a searching history of institu - tional life in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Humble as
Ireland	LOCATION	is , her history is in a measure analogous to all European history .

		For centuries she has had her Guelf and Ghibelline wars , not fought on battlefields , but in cabinets , in petty intrigues , in compromises and collusions , in every way but the one which leads to gain or glory to the Irish people .

		No Dante could symbolize this struggle ; it is without poetry , though not with - out pathos .

		Social life in
Ireland	LOCATION	at the present time requires , too , a fresh analysis .

		An aris - tocracy almost denuded of power , a middle class 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, democratic but unstable , a rural population just entering upon a slight measure of independence , a pauper community hopeless and helpless -- these afford fine material for a study by the publicist of large resource and keen judgment .

		Besides these classes , which are common to all European countries ,
Ireland	LOCATION	has a social life based almost wholly upon sectarian distinctions -- a condition unknown elsewhere .

		This is why Irish patriotism , however sincere , is always in - effectual .

		Here is a subject for a sociological writer to explore , to enlarge upon .

		In treating of
Ireland	LOCATION	's common-school system ,
M. Paul - Dubois	PERSON	has compressed into a single chapter what might have been the main theme of his book .

		Education in
Ireland	LOCATION	is less a subject for the statistician than it is a call to a real crusade .

		On its reformation , particularly in its elementary phases , depends the rehabilitation of a wasting
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		It is also to be regretted that some estimate of the present literary movement as a regenera - tive force in
Ireland	LOCATION	lay outside the purpose of
M. Paul-Dubois	ORGANIZATION	's skiKully compressed treatise .

		A trenchant presentation of this movement as a national force , by a foreigner , might act as a stimulant and a corrective to a group of writers inclined too much to dreaming and not enough to thought .

		Irish writers of to-day , excellent as they are , learn too much of one another .

		They are withdrawing too much into a narrow coterie ; they have their hearts too much in ethnic Ire - land , and not enough in the
Ireland	LOCATION	, weak and desolate , of to-day .

		Much more important to an understanding of contemporary
Ireland	LOCATION	, how - ever , than a criticism of her poets is some gen - uine appreciation of her thinking men .


Ireland	LOCATION	has a saving remnant , but those comprising it win scant sympathy from
M. Paul-Dubois	PERSON	, who dismisses them as '' intellectuals , '' '' Voltaireans , '' '' men who ape the French . ''

		Had he come closer to the heart of
Ireland	LOCATION	's mystery , he would have understood that these are the men who are plucking it out .

		It is true that some of them ape the French .

		He as a Frenchman lost an opportunity to show how they can more effectually do this to the saving of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		This is seen in his attitude toward Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		This gifted Irishman 's history , per - sonal and artistic , is one of the most signifi - cant facts in the
Ireland	LOCATION	of to-day .

		Not till he imitated the erotic in
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	, not till he had spent the prime vigor of his genius on novels contributive to English fiction , did he discover that his own country needed him .

		What he has done for her is in the nature of a plea for liberal thought , a more humanistic interpretation of life .

		A Frenchman is the last man to despise an effort of this kind .

		Others , too , are eager in this enterprise of creating a real zest for life among a people to whom prayer is work rather than work prayer ; whose women have the soul of
Mary	PERSON	but not the thrift of
Martha	LOCATION	; who as a race love art and neglect comfort .

		It is the '' intellectuals '' who under - stand and love the soul of their race .

		It is they , groaning because of the morass of backwardness into which
Ireland	LOCATION	has fallen , who will wish that
M. Paul-Dubois	PERSON	's sympathy had been broader as weU as more intense .

		Conclusion of the
Schurz Reminiscences	ORGANIZATION	.

		* When near the end , Mr.
Schurz	PERSON	told his friends that his only deep regret was the neces - sity of leaving his memoirs unfinished .

		As he had only reached the period of the first term of President
Grant	PERSON	when his pen was laid down , every reader must keenly feel the same regret .

		Of this concluding volume , a little more than three himdred pages are from the hand of Mr.
Schurz	PERSON	; and this is followed by about one hun - dred and fifty pages by Mr.
Frederic Bancroft	PERSON	and Professor
WiUiam A. Dunning	PERSON	, devoted to a sympathetic and very satisfactory sketch of his career from
1869	DATE	to the end .

		In our notice of the first two volumes of these Reminiscences , tribute was paid to those qualities of mind and heart which made of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, notwithstand - ing the fact that his birth and early training were in a foreign land , one of the most admir - able fruitages so far secured from the tree of American institutions and citizenship .

		The great lesson of his life , as of that of
Curtis	PERSON	,
Godkin	PERSON	, and others of his circle of friends and fellow - workers , is that of independ - ence and intelligent idealism .

		He was never daunted by the fact that none of his high ideals in American politics was ever wholly attained .

		Temporary reverses were always to be expected , and each rebuff or delay was only an incentive to renewed effort .

		THE DIAL 88 closing years of his life , he never wavered in the faith that farther sighted and less selfish coun - sels would in the end prevail .

		To the blind party man of either side , his political career of course seemed wholly erratic .

		As a matter of fact , the annals of American public life present few examples of such thorough-going consistency .

		In every crisis the possible courses of action open to him were brought to the test of the fundamental aims toward which his political life was directed , and that course was chosen which , on the whole , seemed likely to do most for the honorable fur - therance of those aims .

		He was never one of those doctrinaire reformers who lose sight of actual conditions and disdain the small gains which are possible in a vain effort for the immediate attainment of more than is within immediate reach .

		And yet no small concession to his demands ever blinded his eyes to other shortcomings on the part of the politician or party by whom it was made .

		The half-loaf which is better than no bread could never be palmed oif on him as the whole .

		The high - tariff policy of the Republican party was always repugnant to him , on moral as well as economic grounds ; but that did not hinder him from supporting the candidates of that party so long as its attitude on the questions growing out of slavery and the Civil War seemed fairly correct and of predominant importance .

		With the sink - ing in relative importance of these war questions under the wise policy of
Hayes	PERSON	, it was inevitable that his views on the civil service and the tariff should draw him to the support of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, as against a Republican with the personal record of
James G. Blaine	PERSON	.

		But when the Democratic party repudiated
Cleveland	LOCATION	for
Bryan	PERSON	and the free-silver craze , his long and frequently attested belief in the vital importance of a sound money system drove him to the support of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The imperialism into which
McKinley	PERSON	was driven , against his own original inclination , was of course deeply repugnant to the man who had done more than any other to thwart a similar project in the days of Grant ; and as other questions seemed temporarily of less significance than this , he gave his support to
Bryan	PERSON	in the election of
1900	DATE	.

		But in none of these cases did he ever stultify himself by saying a word in favor of any part of the platform which was not in harmony with his own judgment .

		Of course all this should have left him wholly without influence on public opinion , according to ordinary party theories ; but the fact of political history is that throughout his public career there was no man in the land whom political committees were more anxious to put on the stump in behaK of their candidates than
Carl Schurz	PERSON	.

		Keen insight , high ideals , moral fervor , strict adher - ence to fundamental principles , and absolute freedom from partisan shackles , were his distin - guishing characteristics .

		Of course , even this can not guarantee absolute inerrancy of judg - ment ; but it would be hard to find any com - bination of qualities calculated to leave a record to which posterity will turn with more unfailing respect and less necessity for apologies .

		We are glad to notice in the preface of this volume an implied promise of further publica - tions .

		It is well known that the epistolary correspondence of Mr.
Schurz	PERSON	was enormous .

		This must have a high value both personally and historically , since he had among his corre - spondents many of the most prominent men of his time , and made constant use of the private letter as an indirect means of influencing public opinion on questions of the day .

		Letters of this latter sort are doubtless amply numerous for separate publication , and we would suggest to his literary executors the propriety of pre - senting them in this way , thus giving the more personal correspondence a better chance to impress upon the reader the more intimate personal characteristics of a man whose charm ing personality had no opportunity to make itself known to more than a small fraction of those who knew and admired him in his public ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ -

		* It is several years since we have had a novel by Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	, whose pen has been chiefly busied with exposing the fallacies of socialism , or revealing the underlying antinomies of current doctrine in science , philosophy , and religion .

		That the hand of the nov - elist has not , however , lost its cunning , becomes sufficiently evident by the time we have read fifty pages of `` An Immortal Soul . ''

		The story thus alluringly entitled opens engagingly upon an English country scene , and soon finds us deeply interested in a social group which has for its principal figures the local clergyman , the returned traveller who is standing for
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, a famous specialist in nervous diseases , and a young girl who is clearly intended to be the heroine .

		The elderly traveller finds in her more than a passing attraction , and the clergyman , who has marked her for his spiritual child , and whose sub-consciousness views her in a more human light , finds his influence weakened , and his hardly formulated hopes threatened by the advent of the stranger .

		Thus far , we are dealing with a novel simply , finished in style and descrip - tion , admirable in invention and characterization .

		But the author 's '' affair '' has a much wider scope than this , and he no sooner gets us thoroughly inter - ested in his heroine and her associates than he approaches his special problem , which is that of diagnosing a case of dual personality .

		For one day his heroine is spirited away , and a young woman reputed to be her sister appears in her stead .

		The delicate and spiritually-minded
Vivian	PERSON	gives place to
Enid	PERSON	, who appears as a girl of sensual disposition , cunning in deception , and instinctively vicious .

		has all the facts in his possession , and to him the girl 's dual nature becomes a study of absorbing interest .

		From about the middle on , the book be - come essentially a scientific treatise , and elaborate discussion figures more and more largely in its pages .

		Yet even this discussion is so fitted into the novelistic machinery that both human and dramatic interest are fairly well preserved throughout .

		The chief element of this interest is provided by the impact of the revelation upon the clergyman , who finds that he must reckon with facts hitherto undreamed of in his philosophy , and who feels the very founda - tions of his belief tottering beneath him .

		He be - comes perplexed in the extreme when he is forced to realize that this '' immortal soul '' which has been the object of his special solicitude is in reality a two-fold thing , and that its one aspect is as abhor - rent to him as its other is appealing .

		Which of the two is the real woman , the spiritual individuality ?

		The theory of possession sustains him for a time , but even that has to be abandoned in the light of a complete record of the girl 's history , which makes it clear that her evil nature is , on the whole , the more predominant and masterful of the two .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	offers us no solution of the problem he has propounded .

		Science is not yet prepared to solve it , or to suggest a reconciliation between such phe - nomena and the older doctrines of psychology and religion .

		The subject is one after the author 's heart , and he has never played more brilliantly his favorite rMe of the destructive critic .

		All his life he has been pointing out the logical defects in sys - tems of thought that seem superficially coherent , and in the present instance , although his form is that of fiction , he has given us one of the keenest and most merciless of his many analyses .

		Readers who do not expect this sort of thing in a novel may well complain that he does not play the game , and will be justified if their quest is for entertainment only .

		But if they are sufficiently serious of mind to enter into the spirit of the author 's speculations , they will give , if anything , a more absorbed attention to his psychological discussion than to the fictive frame - work in which it is set .

Napoleon and Nelson	PERSON	, and of the projected invasion of
England	LOCATION	in
1805	DATE	, written in a style as choppy as the waves of the Channel which baffled the conqueror 's ambition , is given us by Mr.
Alfred Ollivant	PERSON	in the merry invention which he has labeled `` The Gentleman . ''

		There are some four hundred pages of staccato sentences , chronic - ling the events of about ten days , and things are happening all the time .

		The happenings , moreover , are of the most exciting nature , whether by sea or by land , and someone is in mortal peril every hour .

		There are several heroes , including the `` gentle - man , '' who is an Irish soldier of fortune acting as
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's lieutenant , the midshipman -LRB- aged fif - teen -RRB- who saves his country by ingenious and heroic devices , and the fighting parson whose death-dealing sword causes countless - Frenchmen and traitors to bite the dust .

		The story turns about a plot to

		THE DIAL 86 kidnap
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, through the double dealing of
Lady Hamilton	LOCATION	, and the author prudently appends to the tale a declaration to the effect that he will answer no questions concerning it .

		The charac - terizations are extraordinarily vivid , and this is a remarkable feature when we consider the variety of types presented .

		There are a great many horrors on exhibition , and they are depicted with relentless realism , but they are also softened by an infusion of sentiment that makes them endurable , and they often become almost beautiful in the poetic light of the author 's imagination .

		The spirit in which this work is conceived is made clear by the verses on '' Our Sea '' which serve as a preface .

		It is the spirit of invincible pride in the deeds of English seamen from the days of Drake to the days of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, and the story itself reveals the composite inspiration of such diverse novelists as Marryatt and
Kingsley	PERSON	and
Blackmore	PERSON	, such diverse poets as Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	. ''

		The War in the Air '' is a forecast of the develop - ment of atrial navigation which is extremely vivid , as are all of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's imaginings , and not so far removed as most of them have been from what we may admit to be possible .

		The air-ship is c ^ ^ tain to be used for military purposes in the next chapter of warfare , and will doubtless bring with it new possi - bilities of destruction .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	makes of it a ter - rible instrument indeed , and describes its operations with a degree of technical realism that gives us a shuddering anticipation of what may happen when this new menace to civilization is developed only a little more than at present .

		Unlike most writers of fiction who allow their imagination to revel in dead - lier means of destruction than those heretofore avail - able , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does not assume that the common sense of mankind will abandon warfare when it comes to mean annihilation , but pictures for us an increased frenzy of strife which does not cease its fury until civilized society is blotted from the earth 's surface , and what is left of mankind reverts to primitive con - ditions of savagery .

		Civilization suffers final collapse as a logical consequence of its own ingenious refine - ments , and the thought that it bears within its bosom the seeds of its own destruction is strongly impressed upon us .

		The protagonist of this world-tragedy is no heroic figure , but simply the sort of average cockney Englishman who has before served as the medium of the author 's social satire .

		All the amazing things that happen in the book are exhibited in their reflec - tion in the consciousness of this pitiful example of humankind , and this proves the most effective part of the author 's realistic machinery . ''

		The Distributors , '' by Mr.
Anthony Partridge	PERSON	, is a choice tale of a group of men and women , of the highest rank in English society , who , having exhausted all the obvious pleasures of life , resort to the unlawful in their quest for new sensations .

		They form a coterie known as the '' Ghosts , '' ostensibly for the discussion of esoteric philosophies , but actually for the purpose of planning and executing what we may call high-class burglaries .

		Their victims are the selfish rich , who possess more jewels than is good for them , and the loot , when converted into money through the agency of a mysterious '' fence '' -- as free from selfish motives ^ s the '' Ghosts '' themselves -- is bestowed anonymously upon various charities .

		All goes well with their plans until an American girl , piqued because her request to be made a member of the exclusive coterie is denied , and knowing nothing of the criminal side of their activity , sets a detective on their track , and uncovers things of which she had not dreamed .

		The exposure is averted by an appeal to her generosity , the society goes out of existence , and the most conspicuous of its members surprises himself by falling in love , which for him , at least , makes the further quest of illicit sensations quite unnecessary .

		There are numerous thrills in the fan - tastic romance , and much sprightliness of dialogue .

		The author of the '' New Arabian Nights '' would have found in Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	a kindred spirit . ''

		Captain
Margaret	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	, is a romance of adventure in
Virginia	LOCATION	and on the Spanish main , the action being placed in the
late seventeenth century	DATE	.


Charles Margaret	PERSON	is the com - mander of a ship equipped by certain
London	LOCATION	adven - turers for trade with the colonies .

		He is also a man with a broken heart , for the woman whom he loves has taken to herself a husband , and has been so deceived in the bargain that she mistakes a selfish brute of criminal instincts for a hero to be wor - shipped .

		Now it so happens that just as Captain
Margaret	PERSON	is setting sail for
America	LOCATION	, this woman and her husband take refuge upon the ship , for the man has been guilty of forgery , and the officers of the law are hot in pursuit .

		The voyage is a long one , but not long enough to open the woman 's eyes , either to the true character of her husband , or to the unselfish devotion of Captain
Margaret	PERSON	.

		Then follow several chapters of a sojourn in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and a second hasty escape when the Governor receives orders from
England	LOCATION	to arrest the fugitive .

		The final episode is an expedition to the Isthmus in search of treasure , including a highly graphic ac - count of the sacking of one of the Spanish settle - ments .

		When the fugitive is dastardly enough to seek to betray his rescuers into the hands of the enemy , even his wife realizes a situation long before apparent to everyone else , and is not altogether heart - broken when he meets the fate he so richly deserves .

		Whereupon Captain
Margaret	PERSON	comes into his own .

		It is a leisurely tale , but there is a great deal of life in it , and it is informed by the spirit of genuine romance .

		Curiously enough , '' The Devil 's Pulpit , '' which is also the tale of a semi-piratical expedition in search of treasure , is provided with a heroine by a device similar to that adopted by the author of '' Captain
Margaret	PERSON	. ''

		But this time the heroine is a girl , and it is in the company of her uncle , an absconding French banker , that she seeks refuge on the ship just as it is leaving
England	LOCATION	.

		The ship is sent out THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, by a syndicate , acting apon the information conveyed by a mysterious chart of the kind familiar to all readers of tales concerning treasure-seekers .

		Its des - tination is somewhere in the
West Indies	LOCATION	, and the ship 's company , crew and owners alike , constitute a motley and picturesque assemblage of ruffians .

		Of course , there is a hero who saves the situation when matters become critical , and there are a few other decent fellows to stand by him .

		Equally of course , the treasure is found , the ruffians discomfited , and the affections of the heroine properly bestowed .

		As contrasted with '' Captain
Margaret	PERSON	, '' this romance is modern , and its exciting happenings are conceived in the spirit of comedy , commingled with melodrama .

		Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	is the writer , and we all know how inventive he can be , and with what high spirits he can carry his action through .

		Mrs.
Thurston	PERSON	's `` The Fly on the Wheel '' is a simple story of Irish life and character , admirable in its fidelity to fact , and incisive in its delineation of middle-class character .

		The parish priest , the wife and mother of domestic instincts , her shrewish sister , the busybodies and gallants of the town , are all put before us in natural and life-like guise .

		And then , upon this bourgeois backgroimd is projected a great passion , which shipwrecks a family 's happiness , and brings the heroine to suicide .

		This heroine is a young woman whose career is shaped rather by instinct than reason , and for whom the moral obligations upon which society is based have no effective influence .

		Returning home from her French convent , she falls in love with a staid man of affairs , the head of a peaceful household , and her infatuation makes him for a time forgetful of his honor .

		His life hitherto has been one of self-repression , and the impulses she evokes get the better of him .

		It seems to be a case of opposite electric charges , needing only contiguity to effect a union .

		In her case , it is the longing for ease and luxury ; in his , it is the craving for a richer life .

		These motives , acting in connection with a strong element of sensual allurement , prove the com - plete undoing of the woman , and the all but complete ruin of the man .

		It is the parish priest who inter - poses , and , by a few fitly-chosen words of admoni - tion , halts the man 's steps upon the brink of the precipice .

		The story is strong , but not altogether agreeable .

		The heroine of '' Rose - White Youth '' is fifteen , and she dies of a broken back -LRB- supplemented by a broken heart -RRB- on her sixteenth birthday .

		The man in the case is a bronzed explorer , known to scientific fame , a guest of her family at their country house .

		It is a wretched misunderstanding that causes him to misjudge her , and it is not cleared up -LRB- for the girl -RRB- in time to save her from that last reckless ride along the cliff .

		The tragedy of her taking-off is singularly wanton , and we can not quite forgive the author for thus shaping the story .

		For
Betty	PERSON	is a nice girl with long red hair -LRB- mentioned upon nearly every page -RRB- , and her youth does not prevent her from being a highly attractive heroine .

		This story is the work of ''
Dolf Wyllarde	PERSON	, '' and is marred by the frequent employment of sensual suggestion , a fault which has marked the earlier books of this writer , seeming to indicate an inherent vulgarity of mind . ''

		In
Calvert	LOCATION	's Valley '' is a story of the moun - tains of
West Virginia	LOCATION	, introducing us to much the same types of scenery and character as those of which Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	makes the substance of his novels .

		Miss
Montague	PERSON	has neither the humor nor the dramatic incisiveness of the writer with whom her work is thus inevitably brought into comparison , but she tells an effective story in her more leisurely way .

		Page
Emlyn	PERSON	, a young business man from
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, comes to the Valley , and is at once in - volved in a tragedy .

		He is led to believe that , in the semi-consciousness of intoxication , he has pushed
James Calvert	PERSON	over a cliff to his death .

		Meanwhile , the young woman with whom
Calvert	PERSON	was in love is led to believe that her rejection of his advances has impelled him to suicide .

		Presently , these two young persons , each bearing a secret burden of imagined guilt , learn to love one another .

		The outcome remains long in suspense , and there are many search - ings of conscience on both sides before the accidental nature of
Calvert	LOCATION	's death is revealed , and all ends happUy for hero and heroine .

		The whole story is conscientious rather than brilliant , but it sustains a reasonable degree of interest throughout , and is clearly the product of close observation of the moun - tain folk and the mountain setting .

		It is natural to turn from this novel to '' The Fair Mississippian , '' which is Miss Murfree 's latest pro- duction .

		But Miss Murfree seems to have abandoned her mountaineers of late , and with this defection to have lost much of the singular power displayed in her earlier books .

		The present story , although it shows intimate acquaintance with its plantation scene , must be described as essentially commonplace .

		It is , moreover , so weighed down with irrelevant descrip - tion and incident that the action drags , and the criti - cal situations miss much of the effectiveness that might have been given them .

		We can find in this work little indication of the grip upon character which the writer once had , and still less of the flash of poetic imagination which used to light up her tales of the
Great Smoky Mountains	LOCATION	.

		The hero is a young man of fine education and broken fortune , who becomes the tutor of three boys on a
Mississippi	LOCATION	plantation .

		The excitement is furnished -LRB- in diluted form -RRB- by an attack of river-pirates , and by the antics of a ghost .

		The ghost turns out to be a member of the household , and his prowlings are concerned with the hiding of certain documents which affect the ownership of the estate .

		The chatelaine of the plantation is a creature of the most radiant beauty , in consequence whereof the tutor falls in love with her , and the fact that she is ten years his senior is not permitted to interfere with the conventional romantic outcome .

		THE DIAL 87 chological problem worked out in Mr.
Payson	PERSON	's story of ''
BaiTy Gordon	PERSON	. ''

		These qualities in - clude masterful energy , unregulated character , and a strong disposition to over-indulgence in drink .

		We first meet
Barry	PERSON	as a schoolboy , reckless but engaging , and knowing little of his inheritance .

		Summoned to his home in
Virginia	LOCATION	, he finds his father at the point of death , and learns from his lips the burden of the family heredity .

		The knowl - edge sobers him , and does much to develop his manhood , but we feel that he will have a hard strug - gle to win victory over his unruly self .

		A period of life in
New York	LOCATION	follows , which comes to a dramatic climax one evening when he yields to temptation , becomes intoxicated , and is disgraced in the eyes of his friends .

		For his own good , his guardian cuts off his income , and he sets out to make his way in the world .

		A long period of wandering in many quarters of the globe gives him self-discipline , and saves his character from wreck .

		A final episode discovers him engaged in a wild adventure in
Morocco	LOCATION	, where his brother , a civil engineer , has been held captive .

		He effects his brother 's rescue by deliberately offering his own life in exchange .

		Fortunately , this ultimate sacrifice is not required , but his willingness to make it shows how complete is the work of regeneration .

		In the end , his victory is crowned by the love of the woman whom he has worshipped , afar and hopelessly to his seeming , through all the years of exile .

		It makes a stirring tale , effectively told , and fine in its idealism .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's new novel is called ''
Kincaid	PERSON	's Battery , '' and is a story of
New Orleans	LOCATION	in the first years of the Civil War .

		History plays but a small part in it , however , and the interest is essentially private .

		We can not describe it as a successful work of fictive art .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's style is as charm - ing as ever , and his power of characterization re - mains considerable , but he has so succumbed to the temptations of the allusive manner that nothing which may be called straightforward remains to his narrative .

		The effort needed to make out the pattern of his plot is greater than may legitimately be required of the reader , who is likely to get from it only vivid bits of color set in relief upon a nebu - lous background .

		For example , an early chapter is entitled '' One Killed , '' and we are not sure , after reading it , who is killed , or why .

		Indirection carried to this extent becomes a literary vice , and all the author 's charming geniality can not atone for such a neglect of the story-teller 's primary duty .

		The love story which drags through the four hundred pages is one of the most exasperating we have ever en - countered , made so by the extraordinary and unnat - ural effort on the part of each of the lovers to conceal from the other the state of his affections .

		A certain amount of misunderstanding and playing at cross-purposes is quite proper as a means of hold - ing the reader 's interest in suspense , but the device is absurdly overworked in the present instance .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on Ne ^ v Books Evidences of Two years ago there appeared Mr. life on the
Percival Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's exceedingly attrac - red planet .

		^ ive book on `` Mars and its Canals . ''

		This was so exhaustive in its treatment of the author 's observations and his deductions from them that one is at first surprised at the appearance of a new work on Mars from the same pen , after so short an interval .

		The title of the new contribu - tion to Martian literature is '' Mars as the Abode of Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Two years ago Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	delivered a series of eight lectures at the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	, in which he set forth his views as to planetary evolution in general and illustrated them by the example of the ruddy planet .

		These lectures were subsequently published in the '' Century Magazine , '' and are now republished , with some re - vision , in book form .

		The author accepts the planet - esimal theory of the origin of the solar system ; from this starting point a planet , when it becomes suffi - ciently cool to be provided with water , begins to develop the lowest forms of life ; these , increasing in complexity as the process of evolution goes on , finally find issue in rich flora and fauna such as our earth possesses .

		As the surface of the planet loses its original heat the warmth necessary to varied manifestations of life is derived from the sun , which now becomes dominant in the production and pre - servation of life .

		Man appears , and brain begins to be a factor of the greatest significance .

		But the reign of brain can not be so complete as to arrest the chain of changes due to the sun 's action .

		The oceans begin to disappear , and the air to decrease in density ; extensive deserts come into being ; the inhabitants dig canals to utilize to the utmost the failing resources of water .

		In such a state as this Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	believes the planet Mars now to be ; the '' canals '' seen there he thinks to be evidences of the handiwork of intelligent beings .

		He foresees the time when , on account of the loss of the supply of water on our neighbor , life will become extinct there ; this doom foreshadows that of man on the earth .

		For the earth slowly but surely is following the path which Mars is pursuing .

		The foregoing theory is elaborated by the author with the wealth of language , aptness of illustration , and power of exposition , manifested in his many preceding writ - ings .

		The book closes with sixty-odd pages of notes of a mathematical character , which are for the en - lightenment of astronomers .

		The outward appear - ance of the book is as delightful to the eye as its subject matter is to the mind .

		Also , he has wisely allowed his friend to exhibit his own character and his own opinions as far as possi - ble in letters and other writings of his own .

		The cooperation of Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's son , Mr.
Frederick W. Watson	PERSON	, is an additional voucher for the authenticity of the volume .

		Among other things to be noted in reading the book are the suddenness and unprepared - ness with which young
John Watson	PERSON	, at the close of his university course at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, received his father 's behest that he should enter the church ; the zeal with which he threw himself into the work after some five years of preparation : the account of his literary work , which one might wish fuller and longer ; the description of his three visits to Amer - ica ; the extraordinary and militant patriotism which he , a minister of the gospel of peace , displayed on the outbreak of the Boer War ; and the very engag - ing picture of him as a member of society and an unrivalled teller of good stories .

		One is not sur - prised to read his own assertion that he knew not a word of the language of the church when he was called upon to become a preacher , and that he never really acquired its accent even after he had famil - iarized himself with its language .

		Dr.
Nicoll	PERSON	has , acceptably enough , put something of himself into his book , as well as a good deal of ''
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	. ''

		It is all highly interesting and worth reading ; but does not , for some reason , have that indescribable quality of the '' inevitable , '' the best possible , the complete and final , which the greatest biographies seem to possess .

		Perhaps the subject was too diffi - cult , too Protean , too impossible to master .

Evanston	LOCATION	, 111. , and selected for his topic the problems arising from the career in which he is about to complete his fortieth year of service .

		These lectures , now reprinted -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , form a serviceable statement of the several constituent factors that make the
American University	ORGANIZATION	and its administration distinctive , com - plex , and engrossing .

		To the interested outsider , and particularly , it may be surmised , to the foreign student of American institutions , the volume will prove helpful .

		The style is direct , terse , orderly , trenchant ; and thus reflects the clear-minded execu - tive .

		Having chosen so objective , almost detached , a point of view .

		President
Eliot	PERSON	has accomplished his pm ` pose with the success belonging to poise , insight , experience .

		Also , as was inevitable , are there many forcible opinions scattered through the descriptions of the status quo .

		Yet while it may appear ungracious to find fault with the author for not doing what he did not set out to do , the regret is too keen , and too close at hand to be suppressed , that the venerable president of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	did not choose to take the public into his confidence , and write with less reserve , substituting analysis and criticism for mere description , and thus making available the vast resources of wisdom to justify policy and action , which he more than any other has at command .

		A volume not so able , doubtless , yet serving adequately the same purpose , could have been written by any one of a score of
University	ORGANIZATION	presi - dents .

		The volume that President Eliot alone could have written is the source of regret , -- one that might have really discussed the vital issues upon which not practice alone but sound policy must in the future be based . ''

M.A.	LOCATION	, late Scholar of
Keble College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, is volume No. 43 of the `` Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This is one of the more serious biographies in a series whose authors are not quite at one in their methods of treatment ; which fact does not prevent its being extremely readable , as well as valuable in content .

		An elaborate Introduction makes it clear that the native government lost control because it was utterly inadequate to the task of governing , and that the Normans did more in a generation than their pre - decessors had done in a century toward unifying the social customs of
England	LOCATION	.

		The concluding chapter , which deals with the Domesday Book , is a notably thoughtful piece of work .

		The general reader will probably be somewhat startled to learn that this remarkable fiscal census , although it '' may claim to rank as the greatest record of mediaeval
Europe	LOCATION	, '' is based on earlier apportionments which are
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently arbitrary and far from accurate , so that '' a fiscal arrangement which can be traced back to the time of Alfred '' was still '' utilized in the days of
Richard I.	PERSON	and
Hubert Walter	PERSON	. ''

		The secret of
William	LOCATION	's success seems to have been largely the tact that taught him to keep his hands off .

		He begins with a chapter on '' The Rights of Human Nature , '' and discusses the historic assertion of our Declaration ,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 '' That all men are created equal , '' etc. .

		A not very convincing defense is made of this remarkable pronouncement ; it amounts in brief to this , that in personal and civic rights all men stand on a level .

		`` Types of Equality '' is the heading of the next chapter , which considers , without offering any new solution , the problem of alien races within our bor - ders .

		Discussions of such subjects as civil rights , government by consent , written constitutions , parties and party strife , and servants of the public , succeed one another , with the due and expected exhibition of ripe scholarship , but with little of a new , striking , or unusually important nature .

		Perhaps the topics selected hardly admit of very original treatment ; and doubtless , too , the printed page is not so favor - able a medium for these lectures as was oral delivery .

		Somewhat remarkable , however , and having a note almost of prophecy in it , is the following passage from the author 's presidential address before the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1897	DATE	.

		The address itself , or rather a part of it , under the title `` A New Federal Convention , '' closes the volume . ''

		In no respect , as it seems to me , '' says Dr.
Schouler	PERSON	, `` is it plainer that more than our present bare majorities of a quorum should be required , than in such momentous legislation as disturbs our national equilibrium by admitting new States into the Union or by sanctioning the acquisition of alien territory with an alien population .

		In the latter respect we seem simply to have gone forward with - out clear warrant from our Federal charter at all . ''

		To young readers and to old readers , iade - ^ Icum .

		Middle-aged bookmen are commonly too busy , either in reading books or in writing books , or both , to let their thoughts dwell expectantly on a paradise of books that lies in the radiant future , or to linger in fond retrospect on an Augustan age of books that has its place in the golden past .

		The compilers have braved the charge of repetitious platitude and have gathered together `` the most human things written about books , '' no matter if now and then somewhat trite and tiresomely familiar .

		Of course every reader will take the liberty to say to himself that if he had edited the volume he would have included some things omitted , and omitted some things included .

		Among the more conspicuous omissions is
Richard	PERSON	- son 's '' Choice of Books , '' a veritable little classic of its kind , which might well have contributed one brief chapter at least .

		Of less important exclusions may be noted

		Much of the material has been drawn from contemporary memoirs and Archives curieuses .

		At times the reader may feel that the portraits would have gained in significance if the background of conditions and tendencies in politics and literature had been drawn with greater fulness .

		The chap - ters on Charles IX .

		and
Queen Margot	PERSON	possess a special interest , partly because their history is less familiar , but mainly because their characters were so strangely complex .

		In describing her person - ages the author seems occasionally to force the note and to go beyond the evidence of her documents .

		It would seem that a problem which , beginning with the '' Question importante sur la
Mort de Louis XVII.	PERSON	, '' has called forth more than a thousand printed solutions and even maintained several monthly periodicals , would be pretty thor - oughly threshed out by this time .

		The new book claims to be a distinct addition to the literature on the subject , not because it contributes additional information , -- it is for the most part merely a rep - etition of matter that can be found in other easily accessible volumes , -- but because it offers no solu - tion at all , simply a catalogue of the solutions that other writers have concocted or preserved .

		The book is bright and eminently readable ; the author 90 THE DIAL -LSB-

Little Dauphin	LOCATION	, now iu the possession of Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	, and the hitherto unpublished por - trait of the pretender
Naundorff	ORGANIZATION	, from the collection owned by
M. Foulon de Vaulx	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Shelley ^ ^ ^ '' Symposium '' is considered the translation most perfect in form of the Platonic fi-om Plato .

		dialogues , and also one of the pro- foundest and most suggestive in its thought and specidation .

		Shelley 's translation of it is regarded as one of the best examples of his prose style .

		Under the title , '' The Banquet of Plato , '' this trans - lation appears in a limited edition from the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , beautifully printed from Montaigne type on
Batchelor	PERSON	hand-made paper , and bound in plain boards , with paper label .

		It was in the
summer of 1818	DATE	that
Shelley	PERSON	, then at the Baths of
Lucca	LOCATION	, occupied his mornings for nine or ten successive days in turning this dialogue on love -LRB- the only one besides the '' Phaedrus '' that discusses the theme in detail -RRB- into English .

		The subject was congenial , and his love of Greek and familiarity with it , combined with his intuitive sympathy with literary genius wherever found , made the task of translation a light one .

		His version is skilful and fluent , and is perhaps even above the Platonic level in nobility of expression .

		But while it well catches the spirit , it is not always accurate in the letter ; for which , of course ,
Shelley	PERSON	has long since been for - given .

		The external appearance of the present reprint is in every way worthy of the text .

		: notes .

		Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	, author of ''
William Jordan , Jr.	PERSON	, '' has a new novel ready for immediate publication .

		Mr.
William de Morgan	PERSON	's new book , '' Blind
Jim	PERSON	, '' is now ready for the printer , but will not be brought out until next
Spring	DATE	.

		A new book by Mrs.
Jennette Lee	PERSON	, author of '' Uncle William , '' will appear this month .

		The new book is called ''
Simeon Tetlow	PERSON	's Shadow . ''

		A new volume -LRB- the third -RRB- in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature '' will appear this month .

		Its sub - ject is '' The Renascence and the Reformation . ''

		Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, author of '' The Colonel of the Red Huzzars '' and '' The Princess Dehra , '' has written a new novel , to be published in the
Spring	DATE	, under the title , '' The Master of
Fairlawn	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
H. C. Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	, author of the standard biography in English of Moli ^ re , has written a novel dealing with the early life and love affairs of the great French dramatist .

		The book , entitled `` Fame 's Path - way , '' will appear in
March	DATE	.

		When the
Pennells	PERSON	' `` Life of
Whistler	LOCATION	'' was Erst brought out it was the understanding , both in
London	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, that the work would be limited to the original edition , but the demand for the book has been so unexpectedly large that arrangements have been made for another impression .

		The American publishers annoimce that the new edition will be ready immediately .

		It will contain all the original plates and reproductions .

		Last Spring Professor
J. B. Bury	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	was the guest of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, where he delivered the Lane Lectures .

		The substance of these lectures has been incorporated into a book entitled '' The Ancient Greek Historians , '' which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish this month . ''

		Balthasar '' -LRB- the titular story in a collection of seven -RRB- and '' The Well of St. Clare '' are two new volumes in the English edition of the writings of
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	, now in course of publication by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
John Lane	PERSON	translates the former of these volumes , while we owe the latter to Mr.
Alfred AUenson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
J. G. Bartholomew	PERSON	's `` Handy Reference Atlas of the World '' is now in its eighth edition , imported by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a compact volume , and its maps , although small , are clearly printed and artistically agreeable .

		They include a large number which give us small areas on a relatively large scale .

		Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	, editor of '' Punch , '' has collected some forty pieces , mostly of his recent humorous verse , into a volume called '' Salvage , '' which Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	will soon publish .

		As was the case with the author 's '' A Harvest of Chaff '' and '' Borrowed Plumes , '' most of the verses in the new volume first appeared in '' Punch . ''

		It is interesting to note , in connection with the recent award of the Nobel Prize for literature , that ''
Rudolph Eucken	PERSON	's Philosophy of Life , '' by Professor
W. R. Boyce	PERSON	-
Gibson	PERSON	, is already in a second edition .

		Professor and Mrs.
Gibson	PERSON	have almost ready for publication in the Spring a translation of
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Meaning and Value of Life . ''

		Miss
Margaret Symonds	PERSON	's '' Days Spent on a Doge 's Farm '' is , as the publishers say , a book which '' makes of every reader a friend . ''

		It is now republished by
the Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an enlarged edition , with enough additional illustrations to bring the number close to three - score .

		The introduction supplied for this new edition takes the form of a memoir of the
Countess Pisani	PERSON	, whose coimtry estate is the scene of the volume . ''

		German Literatvu-e in
American Magazines	ORGANIZATION	,
1846	DATE	to 1880 '' is the title of a monograph by Mr.
Martin Henry Haestel	PERSON	now published by
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		It continues the work of Dr.
S. H. Goodnight	PERSON	upon the same subject prior to
1846	DATE	, published two years ago in the same series .

		The last year considered by Mr.
Haestel	PERSON	is the first year of The Dial , and four refer - ences are given to our first voliune , but curiously enough the only index entry of the periodical refers to the late
Moncure Conway	PERSON	's
Cincinnati	LOCATION	`` Dial '' of
1860	DATE	, from which eight articles on German literature are catalogued .

		Among the more important books on
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's
Spring	DATE	list are the following : A history and forecast of the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	, entitled '' The World United , '' by Mr.
John George Leigh	PERSON	, a
London	LOCATION	engineer and specialist on the canal ; `` Letters from
China	LOCATION	, '' by Mrs.
Sarah Pike Conger	PERSON	, wife of the late Minister to
China	LOCATION	; '' The Empire of the East , '' an illustrated de - scription of
Japan	LOCATION	, by Mr.
H. B. Montgomery	PERSON	; `` A Summer in Tomaine , '' a profusely illustrated study of the old chateaux of the
Loire	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Frederick Lees	PERSON	; and '' A Summer Garden of Pleasure , '' by Mrs.
Stephen Batson	PERSON	, with thirty-six colored illustrations by Mr.
Osmund Pittman	PERSON	.

		NOTES 118 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 119 LINCOLN .

		Nearly forty-four years have passed since that `` startled
April	DATE	morning '' when the word went forth from
Washington	LOCATION	that our great President was no more .

		For close upon half a century he has been numbered among the small company of immortals who '' sit with their peers above the talk , '' and the fitness of the words , '' Now he belongs to the ages , '' spoken by
Stanton	PERSON	in the hushed chamber when the assassin 's victim had drawn his last breath , are now perhaps just beginning to be realized .

		This centennial year of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's birth has rightly been singled out to signalize his achievements , and still more to emphasize the value of the example offered by his life and character .

		The record of his words and deeds has long been , and will long remain , one of the chief springs upon which our national idealism is fed ; and purer waters never flowed into the current of a people 's life .

		Those of us whose lives overlapped his , whether we ever saw him in the flesh or not , have a sense of personal possession in which the younger generation can not share .

		Even if we have nothing more than childish recollections of the tragic day of his death , of the awed silence that surrounded us when the tidings came , and of the grief that might be expressed in sobs but not in words , we have a memory that has grown precious as it has become chastened , and that makes Lincoln in very truth a part of our own lives .

		No one can ever quite efface from con - sciousness the very real distinction between past and present , between the world which we may know from books alone , and the world upon which our own eyes and ears have been opened .

		To all Americans who have roimded the half - century cape there exists to-day a Lincoln essentially although perhaps indefinably differ - ent from the Lincoln known to those born since the year of
Appomattox	LOCATION	.

		And as long as such Americans shall survive , it will be their sacred obligation to do what they may to keep vital an image which is fast receding into the ghostly realm of legend .

		For it is quite clear that mythopoetic forces are already busied with the deeds and the char - acteristics of the Emanipator , and that the man is fast becoming invested with the attributes of 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the tutelary hero and the demigod .

		The trans - formation is inevitable , and idealism becomes the gainer from it by so much as reality suffers loss .

		Every age has thus dealt with the com - manding figures of the past which have been singled out as its exemplars .

		It has been so with
Caesar	PERSON	and
Charlemagne	PERSON	, with
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	.

		The characters of these men , and of countless others of similarly resounding fame , is figured in our modern consciousness under a guise that would have seemed strange indeed to their contemporaries .

		So with
Lincoln	PERSON	, the new generation is already coming to view him in a light very different from that in which he stood revealed in the days of the nation 's fiery trial .

		The figure of a hero thus recreated by the idealizing instinct of a whole people takes on outlines that bear little relation to the man in his habit as he lived ; it reveals , however , with unerring certainty the image of what we would fain believe him to have been .

		The figure which was in process of reconstruction from the time of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's ode and
Whitman	PERSON	's threnody to the time of the statue by
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	, and which is being still more definitely shaped in this centennial year , is far more the expression of our ideal than it is of our memory , and it speaks well for the national character in the twentieth century that this ideal is so pure and wholesome and altogether worthy of our devotion . ''

		What a piece of work is a man ! ''

		What a bewildering complex of acts and moods and impulses and compromises with existence is any given individual , and what insight it requires to disengage the essentials of a character from its many confusing accidents !

		Perhaps , after all , we may come to have clearer knowledge of a man when his muddy vesture of decay has been cast aside , and time has withdrawn us far from his presence .

		Do we see the real Lincoln when we read of the country store-keeper , the itinerant lawyer , the petty politician , and the retailer of coarsely humorous anecdote , or do we first really know him when he speaks to us in the Inaugurals and the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address ?

		lu biography as in history there are many de - grees of reality , ranging from the lower to the higher levels , and the sound instinct -- par - ticularly the collective instinct -- learns in time to discriminate between these various orders of fact , to care little for what is merely trivial and commonplace , to discern the shining life of the spirit as a thing apart from the didl life shaped by material environment .

		We are still making too much of the lower realities of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life in this memorial season , but time will rectify that miscalculation , and fix our thought more and more f idly upon the things which are worthy of immortal remembrance .

		The celebration whose echoes are stUl ringing in our ears has had , like all similar outpourings of feeling , the defects of its qualities .

		There has been a good deal of splurge about it , a good deal of the perfunctory or insincere , a good deal of empty parade and display of self-seeking .

		How much of it has been genuine reverence and how much lip-service it would be hard to say ; the admixture of the two elements has been obvious enough , although we may not be able to state the proportions .

		But on the whole , the demonstration has made for good .

		It has doubtless been the occasion of some soul - searching on the part of men and women , and of much seed-sowing in the minds of the young .

		To what moral disaster the nation has in recent years forsaken Lincoln 's teachings and departed from the example of his life must have been brought home to those who have renewed the study of his career , and out of all this multitude there surely will be some , perhaps there will be many , who will '' highly resolve '' that he shall not have lived and died in vain , and that the '' new birth of freedom '' which he helped to give the nation shall be reaffirmed in deed no less than in word .

		His political principles , now cynically flouted in the high places of our government , and his ideals of social obligation , now made a mockery by predatory and selfish wealth , would soon become controlling influ - ences in our national life if we really meant one-half of what we have been saying during the past week .

		If our words had purpose behind them , in any sort of proportion to their vehem - ence and volume , the day of regeneration would be now at hand .

		Once more our thoughts go back to that
spring	DATE	day '' when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed , '' when there was given '' To death 's own sightless-seeming eyes a light Clearer , to death 's bare bones a verier might , Than shines or strikes from any man that lives . ''

		On the
last Sunday	DATE	of his life , Lincoln had read aloud , and , after a pause , repeated these lines from '' Macbeth '' : ''
Duncan	PERSON	is in his grave ; After life 's fitful fever he sleeps well ; Treason has done his worst : nor steel , nor poison , Malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing Can touch him further . ''

		A few days later , treason 's worst had been done upon him also , and the apotheosis proclaimed
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 103 by
Stanton	PERSON	's words haxi become his portion .

		There is a sense in which we may be glad that death came to him at sueh a time and in such a manner .

		His life and death were thus given a unity which appeals to the artist in us ; they seem to constitute a tragedy of faultless design .

		Lincoln would have served his country wisely had he been spared , but perhaps we may say that fate , through the agency of the assassin 's weapon , made him the instrument of a better and more enduring service by bestowing upon his career that supreme consecration .

		No words can be fully adequate to express the significance of such an end as was Lincoln 's , but music is always ready to aid us when words fail , and the sublime strains of '' Death and Transfiguration '' completely interpret for us that transition from life to death , or , as the mystics of all ages have it , from illusion to reality , from death-in-life to life itself , true and everlasting .

		EDGAR
ALLAN POE	PERSON	: A CENTENARY O
UTLOO K. I.	PERSON	`` The real
Poe	PERSON	, '' writes his latest biographer , `` is a simple , intelligible , and , if one may dare say it , a rather insignificant man .

		To make a hero or a villain of him is to write fiction . ''

		And yet to have to waU , '' Romance beside his unstrung lute lies stricken dead , '' abandoning the legend so long cherished , -- this seems too numbing to our sensibilities .

		Happy the suburbs of sound criticism , where he who mourned
Lenore	PERSON	, and told of murders in a
Paris	LOCATION	street , and brought the gooseflesh to young limbs and old with
Ligeia	PERSON	's eeriness and
Morella	PERSON	's ghost , is still the
Poe	PERSON	who died in hospital after a wild Byronic life , adventurous and perverted ; the
Poe	PERSON	, in fine , for whom '' The sickness , the nausea , The pitiless pain , Have ceased , with the fever That maddened my brain , With the fever called ' Living ' That burned in my brain , -- '' since now a new and unfamiliar figure has stalked stiff and unasked into our company : a
Poe	PERSON	who overworked at book-reviews , and whose worst vice would seem to be a weakness for '' superior women . ''

		Surely , '' we have sold our birthright for a mess of facts ! ''

		As
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	put it long ago : '' If
Poe	PERSON	fared ill at the hands of his enemy , he has fared worse , on the whole , at those of his friends . ''

		For , without failing to establish , with a different emphasis , most of the unpleasant facts recorded but only half-proved by the '' perfidious ''
Griswold	PERSON	, his later biographers have raised him to a demi-respectability too nearly bourgeois to be poetic , -- have deprived him , then , of the compan - ionship of
Heine	LOCATION	and Musset and
Byron	PERSON	, for which he was a candidate .

		The first man of letters to romanticize his strange unhappy life was
Poe	PERSON	him - self .

		It was he who recounted adventures that were never his , in countries that he never visited -- in
France	LOCATION	, in
Greece	LOCATION	, in
Russia	LOCATION	even .

		Taking the cue , his French biographers have hailed in Poe the poete-nSvrosS , the ffSnie morhide ; Germans have ascribed his productivity to alcoholic epilepsy or to paranoia ; but now we needs must read : '' The warmth of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, boulevard mirth , however stimulating to other mad bards of
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, never fetched a song from him . ''

		And it is true !

		Poe was less a drunkard than we -- comforted by the thought that a
New England	LOCATION	con - science mates not with dark eyes '' in a fine frenzy rolling , '' consoled by our utter respectability for our want of genius -- have fondly made him out ; and in so far as he was ever drunkard , his craving came from lust of
Lethe	LOCATION	, or from the insistence of a decadent organism .

		If alcohol but made
Poe	PERSON	ill , then it is clear that here was a poet as dreary in his vice as the rest were in their virtue .

		Perhaps there is a moral profit in our seeing the poet stripped of all illusion , -- great in spite of his weakness , and not on its account .

		And yet the letting in of daylight on the dark places of a
Rous	PERSON	- seau 's career , or of a
Poe	PERSON	's , seems almost as grievous an offence against aesthetics as the absurdities of pseudo-scientific criticism .

		The romance spun around
Chatterton	PERSON	or our American has been the poesy of those who take their poesy in prose . ''

		I 've an idea , '' wrote
Aldrich to Stedman	PERSON	, '' that if
Poe	PERSON	had been an exemplary , conventional , tax-oppressed citizen , like
Longfellow	PERSON	, his few poems , striking as they are , would not have made so great a stir . ''

		Cheap as is the quality of fame springing from sentimentalism , if it has brought the heedless crowd under a poet 's spell it may be better than truth itself .

		If one can - not throw the white veil over the passions of a
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, a
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	or a Poe in
America	LOCATION	, let us ignore the life and look but to the fine achieve - ment .

		More than once has genius stood distinct from moral greatness , -- though we may hold , with
Lowell	PERSON	, that all great geniuses have that greatness too .

		It is an unimportant question , here ; for
Poe	PERSON	, whatever the personality , was a great artist .

		There need have been no sullying of his memory , or hovering over those last and painful years . ''

		He was never the same again , '' wrote the gentle
Mitchell	PERSON	who has just left us , of the
Poe	PERSON	who had lost his
Virginia	LOCATION	. '

		• ' We have hardly a right to regard what he did after this -- whether in the way of writing , of love-making , or of business projects -- as the work of a wholly responsible creature .

		It were perhaps better if the story of it all had never been told . ''

		Without his finishing touch of dying in the garret , Chatterton would never have come so near to being 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, read by a generation as late and antipathetic as our own .

		Without his vagabondage , de Nerval might by this time be forgotten .

		But
Poe	PERSON	needs nothing of this histrionic glamor ; and so it matters little how he died -- or lived .

		New England critics have always seemed a little overweighted by their own sublimity in writing of this man ; but if , as
Lowell	PERSON	says , he was '' three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge , '' we are grateful that the genius in his com - position gave to the world , along with those poems that have won the popular admiration , others less obvious but more beautiful , -- '' To
Helen	PERSON	, '' and ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	, '' and even '' Ulalume , '' with tales that prove
Poe	PERSON	, too , cognizant of '' that element which , for want of a better name , we call character '' -- the ``
William Wilson	PERSON	'' or `` The Tell-tale Heart . ''

		It is upon the tales that present emphasis is placed ; and among them ''
William Wilson	PERSON	'' with its doppel - gdnger , '' Valdemar '' and '' Mesmeric Revelations '' with their hypnotism , '' Ragged Mountain '' with its hypnotism and metempsychosis mingled in one dis - turbing whole , have made almost as wide a stir and an even deeper impression than the cruder tales of horror , like `` The Black Cat , '' or the stories of what their author called `` ratiocination . ''

		Thus it is strange , to say the least , that in what must be regarded as the standard memoir of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, that by Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	in the `` American Men of Letters '' series , no mention is made of him who , before
Poe	PERSON	, most consistently made use of these devices -- hypnotism habitually , and auto-duplication until
Brandes	PERSON	writes of him , `` To
Hoffmann	PERSON	, the Ego is simply a disguise worn on the top of another disguise , and he amuses himself by peeling off these disguises one by one . ''

		In
Hoffmann	PERSON	's diary one may read : '' Possessed by thoughts of death and doppelgdnger ... Seized by a strange fancy at the ball on the sixth , -- imagined myself looking at my Ego through a kaleidoscope , -- all the forms moving round me are Egos , and annoy me by what they do and leave undone ... Why do I think so much , sleeping and waking , about madness ? ''

		Though there is no proof that
Poe	PERSON	, who shared these thoughts of multiple Ego and of madness , ever read `` The Devil 's Elixir , '' or
Hoffmann	PERSON	's other tales , the '' phantasy-pieces '' whose name he gave to his own excursions in the same weird field , it is certain enough that he knew them indirectly through the work of
Scott	PERSON	and others , -- quite as he professed to know the tales of
Tieck	PERSON	, whom he hailed as
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's master .

		And there is no difficulty in exaggerating the debt of
Poe	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	to the Germans , whose fiction remained Gothic , whUe that of the Americans struck a new note -- not national so much as universal .

		As
Poe	PERSON	said , '' If in many of my productions terror has been the thesis , I maintain that terror is not of
Germany	LOCATION	, but of the soul . ''

		It is not merely in the deeper simplicity , the higher art , of our own story-tellers , that they differ from their German models -- if models they ever found in the Hoffmanns and Tiecks and Novalis .

		In this very circumstance that their terror is of the soul , and not of
Germany	LOCATION	, we may find the secret of their freshness and power to-day .

		The disposition to regard
Poe	PERSON	as a '' Germanic dreamer , '' however natural to continental criticism , seems to the nearer witness totally mistaken .

		As was pointed out in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's own lifetime , while occupying that dim land stretching from the outer limits of the probable into the '' weird confines of superstition and unreality , '' he combined qualities that are seldom united ; '' a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery , and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed . ''

		There is , in '' The Facts in the Case of
M. Valdemar	PERSON	, '' that blending of science and romance which makes us shiver in reading it to-day , when
Tieck	PERSON	has become to us exciting only to the risibili - ties , and
Hoffmann	PERSON	but a weaver of idle fantasies . ''

		The breeze , the breath of God , is still , And the mist upon the hill Shadowy , shadowy , yet unbroken .

		Is a symbol and a token ; How it hangs upon the trees , A mystery of mysteries ! ''

		So in the work of
Hearn	LOCATION	, in our own generation , is there a blending of the mystic and the tangible -- the matter-of-fact , almost -- which moves us as true ghostliness , when ghastliness would not suffice .

		III .

		To-day we praise
Poe	PERSON	as the true inventor of a class of fiction variously estimated and everywhere enjoyed .

		The writer himself belittled his tales of ratiocination , and complained that they should ever have had more vogue than what we hold with him his greater achievement .

		But for the crowd which sees in the poet only the writer of '' The Raven '' and '' The Bells , '' he will ever be , in prose fiction , the writer of '' The Murders in the Rue Morgue , '' '' The Purloined Letter , '' and `` The Gold-Bug . ''

		It is on this side that he is most easily followed by less gifted craftsmen ; and if '' an entire literature '' has been founded upon '' The Raven , '' it is no less remarkable that , although
Poe	PERSON	was the initiator of a new genre in these tales , he has never been im - proved upon .

		In the elegant phrase of Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	'' rang the bell the very first time he took aim . ''

		If , as this critic of the '' short - story '' has pointed out ,
Poe	PERSON	's tale differs from older tales of terror , seeking to interest us not in the horrors of a mystery but in the steps taken to untie a knotty problem , it is no less true that it differs from its developments in the hands of modern prac - titioners .

		We have the word of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	's most clever manufacturer , that while his own crea - tion is bloodless and mechanical ,
Poe	PERSON	's figures are neither mere automata nor beings '' fantastically inhuman , '' and that '' one story by
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	would be worth a dozen '' such as his .

		If
Poe	PERSON	's tales are too strange not to be true , perhaps the par - adox of Oscar Wilde is not without its meaning , --
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 perhaps literature does sometimes anticipate , not copy , life , and mould it to its purposes : life the mirror , art the reality .

		Poe himself might have enunciated some such mad doctrine .

		Literature was his religion , said his employer ,
Graham	PERSON	, -- paraphrased by an ungentle essayist who has said , `` In the place of moral feeling , he had the artistic conscience . ''

		Surely , he had both : and therein lurked a world of woe .

		In this early epoch of our literature was marked the passage from superstition over into a shadowy symbolism , most properly vague ; the allegory was here more used by
Hawthorne	PERSON	, but
Poe	PERSON	used it too -- and with a perfect artistry .

		There are , to be sure , tales which we ignore .

		In the exigencies of a hand - to-mouth existence ,
Poe	PERSON	wrote his arabesques , -- his `` Omelettes '' and his `` Spectacles , '' -- such as a kindly editor leaves out when he collects the fic - tion .

		It is in an absence of humor -- and , alas !

		an apparent ignorance that the humor is lacking -- that
Poe	PERSON	is most deficient when we compare him with the man of Salem .

		Yet what a record is his for the short life he had , and the difficulties he faced ! ''

		It was he , '' writes a foreign critic , `` who opened up , in his `
Hans Pfaal	PERSON	, ' the way of the scientific novel ; he who invented the detective story with the '
Rue Morgue	ORGANIZATION	, ' and the novel of spirit - ism with his stories of
Bedloe	LOCATION	and
M. Valdemar	PERSON	. ''

		And there remains his verse .

		Incidentally mentioned here , that passing notice shall suffice .

		It is the poetry which least needs explanation , -- and its body is so small , its perfection at its best so unmistakable , there is no need to recapit - \ ilate either the monstrous praises or the petty blame which it has oft evoked . ''

		Once as yet , '' in
Swinburne	LOCATION	's well-remembered word , '' once as yet , and only once , has there sounded out of it all -LSB- all
America	LOCATION	-RSB- one pure note of original song -- worth singing , and echoed from the singing of no other man ; a note of song neither wide nor deep , but utterly true , rich , clear , and native to the singer . ''

		Let that estimate stand .

		And while it would be grateful to linger over one 's favorites in the slender volume of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , and to discuss his theory , real and pretended , in things poetical and critical , all has been said in these hun - dred years which have elapsed since his birth there in
Boston	LOCATION	-- chUd of the stage .

		His mysterious death , sixty years ago , is but the slightest of the bonds between him and the one name that precedes his on the roll of American poets .

		There was a premoni - tion of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's coming , when the poet of our Revolution ,
Philip Freneau	PERSON	, composed his '' House of Night '' : '' Trembling I write my dream , and recollect A fearful vision at the
midnight	TIME	hour ; So late , Death o'er me spread his sable wings , Painted with fancies of malignant power . ''

		Let others draw from smiling skies their theme , And tell of climes that boast unfading light ; I draw a darker scene , replete with gloom , I sing the horrors of the
House of Night	ORGANIZATION	. ''


Warren Barton Blake	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The weighing and measuring of genius is not often attempted , and is sure to be found a baffling undertaking .

		Nevertheless Dr.
Frederic Lyman Wells	PERSON	has had the zeal and persistence to carry through `` A Statistical Study of Literary Merit '' ; for thus he entitles his account of certain minute and marvellous investigations of the peculiar properties of ten leading American authors .

		The
English Graduate Club of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	aided him in his work , and the results are printed by
the Science Press	ORGANIZATION	as number seven in the series known as `` Archives of Psychology . ''

		Far be it from a non-statistician to decry the virtues of statistics .

		In the
first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	the great French physician
Louis	PERSON	mightily advanced the science of medicine by the statistical or numerical study of diseases ; and the value of statistics in vari - ous other departments of science is indisputable .

		But to fit the strait jacket of statistical tabulation on the gloriously unfettered form of artistic or lit - erary genius is even worse than yoking
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	to the plough .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's pages are packed with numbers and letters , with arbitrary markings and abbreviations , with tables and headache-generating disquisitions thereon .

		To some it may be illumi - nating to learn that the p. e. -LRB- probable error ? -RRB-

		in this sort of assaying is capable of mathematical expres - sion in the form of a fraction whose numerator is .845
A. D.	PERSON	, and whose denominator is the square root of w -- 1 .

		But to us the best thing in the whole learned treatise is this : '' It is a not uncommon observation that we often form judgments for which we can not give satisfactory reasons , and it is per - haps not less common to observe that these judg - ments are about as likely to be correct as those for which we can .

		To this empirical generalization the above figures seem to lend experimental support .

		We are more accurate in our opinions than in our reasons for them . ''

		... The fascinating problem of the origin of LANGUAGE will tease and baffle , delight and torment the curious philologist until the world shall come to an end and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll .

		A new and plausible and well-defended hypothesis is offered by Professor
Fred Newton Scott	PERSON	in his late address as president of the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps , how - ever , it would be dangerous to claim entire novelty for his tentative solution of the problem , since nothing whatever under the sun is entirely new .

		Be that as it may , he traces the '' genesis of speech '' to respiration . ''

		If we consider , '' he says , in one sig - nificant passage of his address , '' how intimately the most elementary phenomena of speech are related to the musculature of the thorax and diaphragm , we shall see some reason for suspecting that the life - serving movement from which speech has arisen is ordinary respiration .

		Such , at any rate , is the hypothesis which I shall adopt .

		Speech , in its in - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ception , is significantly modified breathing .

		Just as gesture arose from movements of the hand in obtaining food or warding off enemies , so speech arose from the movements of the muscles of the thorax and diaphragm in obtaining a fresh supply of oxygen and in rejecting the harmful products of physiological combustion . ''

		Just how exactly Pro- fessor
Scott	PERSON	's further elaborated and extremely inter - esting explanation of the stages in speech-evolution fits the actual truth of the matter , no one will ever be able to determine ; for no eye-witness , -- no ear - witness rather , -- can be summoned for cross - examination .

		His theory is at least an appreciable advance from the amusing tradition which arbi - trarily assigned such and such a language to
Adam	PERSON	and Eve in
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, another to the serpent , and still another to the Lord . ''

		The Genesis of Speech '' is issued in pamphlet form by the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		... A LIBRARY ON WHEELS , which has already sev - eral times attracted our attention and elicited our approving comment , may be seen by any interested visitor to the rural districts of
Washington County	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		Its librarian -LRB- librarian and coachman in one -RRB- fills a position that is probably unique .

		The '' Seventh Annual Report '' of the free library at
Hagerstown	LOCATION	, whence this Book Wagon starts out on its sixteen routes of travel , has this -LRB- among other things -RRB- to say of its activities : '' It far exceeds the travelling library or deposit station in its use - fulness , in that the personal element enters into the work ... Furthermore , the work of a Library in a community is never solely to supply known wants , but ever and always to be on the alert to create a demand .

		The gospel of books is like the gospel of eternal life for which the world has never hungered untU it has been brought to them by the zeal of its ministers . ''

		Other country districts might well adopt the Book Wagon , pending the provision of better library facilities .

		Indeed , why not equip and send forth a number of library railway cars to visit small railroad towns that have no public libraries ?

		We have agricultural schools and roadmaking semi - naries , and even churches , rolling over the prairies on steel rails and doing an extensive missionary work .

		The library car ought to prove even more useful than the book wagon .

		... Ak early portrait of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, painted in oil on an oak panel , has been received by the
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	by bequest from the late
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, with the testator 's request that it be inscribed as a memorial of two Chaucer-lovers ,
Francis James Child	PERSON	and
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	.

		The back of the panel bears the following inscrip - tion : '' This picture was presented by Miss
Frances Lambert	PERSON	to
Benjamin Dyke	PERSON	on the 16th of Sep - tember ,
1803	DATE	, to perpetuate the memory of her late invaluable relation ,
Thomas Stokes	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, of Llan - shaw Court , in the county of
Gloucester	LOCATION	, where it was preserved for more than three centuries , as appears from the inventory of pictures in the posses - sion of that ancient and respectable family . ''

		The earlier history of the portrait is unknown , but it bears a close resemblance to the only authentic likeness of the poet , the miniature in Occleve 's '' De Regimine Principum '' -LRB- written in 1411-12 -RRB- .

		Professor Nor - ton received the panel portrait as a gift from Mr.
James Loeb	PERSON	, who had bought it of
Faixfax Murray	ORGANIZATION	.

		To learn through whose hands it had passed , from first to last , would not greatly profit us ; but the near resemblance of the picture to the face we already know so well as
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's is significant .

		How much clearer is our mental image of the great fourteenth - century poet than of his still greater sixteenth-century compatriot , even though the latter is three hundred years nearer to us in time .

		We may have a truer likeness of Shakespeare than of Chaucer , but we are not certain which one of several portraits it is .

		In Chaucer 's case , however , we are not confused by a number of widely differing possibilities .

		... The next lecturer before the Alliance Fran ^ aise is to be
M. Marcel Poete	PERSON	, librarian of the
Paris Institute of Municipal History	ORGANIZATION	, a writer and lecturer of repute , an antiquary of untiring re - search , and editor of the Bulletin published by the Library of the
City	LOCATION	of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- That he is not also a poet , in keeping with his uncommon and striking family name , will hardly surprise anyone ; for libra - rianism and verse-making are weaknesses seldom united in the same person , although
Chicago	LOCATION	can boast of a poet-librarian , and a suburban library within sight of
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	is in charge of a maker of very acceptable and often delightfully humorous verse . -RRB-

		The published list of
M. Porte	ORGANIZATION	's lectures in this country promises a rare treat .

		Among other attractive titles are these : '' The Pont-Neuf , or the Life of the People in the Seventeenth Centmy , '' '' The Fashionable Promenades of the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' A Picture of
Paris	LOCATION	in the Time of the Revolution , '' `` Madeleine-Bastille , or a Little History of the Grands Boulevards , '' '' The Cries of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' '' Artistic Influence : The Primitive Parisian Paint - ers , '' and ``
Paris	LOCATION	in the Time of the Romanticists . ''

		Numerous and interesting lantern-slide illustrations will enliven the lectures , which promise to be every way worth while for those who have ever visited
Paris	LOCATION	, those who intend to visit
Paris	LOCATION	, and -LRB- most of all -RRB- those who despair of ever being able to visit
Paris	LOCATION	... Sweetness and light in the reading-room -- that is , a pure atmosphere and a sufficient natural or artificial illumination of the page under perusal -- should be abundantly provided for in every public library .

		The peculiar smell that greets the wor - shipper in old churches , especially country churches , the smell that for so many ages was mistaken for the odor of sanctity , has its counterpart in the stuffiness and closeness of old libraries ; only there it is sup - posed to be the fragrance of erudition , the perfume from the flowers of poesy and from the various anthol -

		THE DIAL 107 ogies and other specimens of literary efflorescence culled by careful hands from belletristic gardens .

		This indescribable `` bouquet '' has doubtless been unthinkingly taken by many as an essential and even highly desirable attribute of a well-appointed library .

		At any rate , we all know the shudder of horror that so often attests high displeasure when windows are opened and it is sought to replace a nineteenth -LRB- or eighteenth -RRB- century atmosphere with a twentieth - century one .

		But not all users of public libraries are enemies of light and air .

		A solicitation of public - library suggestions from the laity has been diligently conducted by Dr.
Louis N. Wilson	PERSON	, librarian at
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	, and among other more or less interesting and instructive complaints against the existing order are a number of protests against insufficient provision of light and air in some of our reading-rooms .

		Poor ventilation is far more prevalent than poor lighting .

		`` As for ventilation , '' declares one respondent , `` libra - ries do not know what the word means . ''

		Too many librarians are ignorant , in proportion to their book - learning , of the value and need of abundant oxygen .

		Litter and litebature seem to have more than an alliterative relation to each other .

		Looking at the working habits of writers , one is almost tempted to say , The more litter , the more literature , -- although there are conspicuous exceptions .

		Walt Whitman 's room in
Camden	LOCATION	was notoriously untidy .

		De Quincey 's writing was done in various more or less obscure resorts , with no observance of method and order .

		The elder
Dumas	PERSON	can not be imagined as sitting at an immaculately tidy desk , with pens , paper , inkstand , paper-cutter , reference manuals , and so forth , all in their appointed places .

		On the other hand ,
Thackeray	PERSON	's exquisitely neat and legi - ble script suggests nothing so much as well-trimmed pens -LRB- goose-quills , of course -RRB- and a writing-desk in proper order .

		Lowell 's study at
Elmwood	LOCATION	, too , was no wilderness of disorder .


Walter Pater	PERSON	's rooms at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	were almost painfully self-conscious in their immaculateness .

		FitzGerald revelled in the chaotic and the haphazard .

		Scott and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, we can imagine , wrote with piles of manuscript and other papers on either hand .

		In general , can we , even the most orderly of us , conceive of the frenzy of inspired composition as for a moment vexing it - self with considerations of symmetry and balance and geometrical regularity in the disposal of books and papers and other appurtenances of the study ?

		• • • The progress of spelling-reform , as marked by the successive lists of '' Simplified Spellings '' sent out from No. 1
Madison Avenue	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, by the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	, is interesting , though necessarily a somewhat melancholy sight to those who cling to the old forms with all their cher - ished associations .

		Happily for the `` old fogies , '' however , the new forms in all their shivering naked - ness of phonetic spelling are not very rapidly invading our current literature .

		The inevitable shock will be eased by this slowness of adoption , and it may well be -LRB- as , indeed , we hope it will be -RRB- that the familiar old spellings will , to all intents and purposes , last out our time .

		After us , the deluge of heterographic novelties may set in -- if it must -- but we hope to sleep untroubled in our graves .

		List number three of these '' Simplified Spellings '' has appeared .

		It embraces words having ea pro- nounced as short e , preterites and participles ending in - ed pronounced - d , words ending in unaccented - ice pronounced - is , and words ending in - ve -LRB- after I or r -RRB- pronounced - v , -- about two hundred and fifty in all . ''

		In due course , '' we are informed , '' the three lists will be printed in one alfabetic order , and used as a basis for more extensiv simplifications to appear in a larger list or Vocabulary of Simplified Spellings . ''

		... Dr.
Osler	PERSON	as chief speaker at the coming LIBRARY DEDICATION , -- the dedication , namely , of the fine Medical and
Chirurgical Library	ORGANIZATION	building connected with the
Johns Hopkins Hospital	ORGANIZATION	and expected to be finished this month and opened in
May	DATE	, -- will be sure to draw a full audience .

		What - ever his subject , which will not fail to be appropriately serious , his address will be pointed with epigram and enlivened with apt allusion and anecdote .

		Another distinguished participant in the exercises will be Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		Reminiscences of a Noted Woman .

		* In turning the pages of the Reminiscences of Lady
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	, covering a period of nearly thirty years , the reader is confronted with such a multiplicity of persons , places , and events , as to be wellnigh bewildered .

		But they are presented in so entertaining a fashion that the task becomes a delightful one .

		It is a book that one may pick up and lay down , read and re-read .

		The author has a natural talent for seeing things , and a charming way of describing them .

		From the time of her debut , in the early seventies , into English political and social life , she has , by fortuitous circumstances as well as by a pleasing personality , made herself an influ - ential and powerful factor .

		As the young wife of a Cabinet minister , she discharged her duties with tact and delicacy .

		It was no easy matter , in the days of her early career , to overcome the resentment shown to Americanism ; but how cleverly Lady
Randolph	PERSON	played her part is shown in these pages . ''

		Thirty years ago , '' she remarks , '' there were very few Americans in
London	LOCATION	.

		In
England	LOCATION	, as on the Continent , the American woman was looked upon as a strange and abnormal creature with habits and manners between a Red Indian and a Gaiety girl .

		Any - thing of an outlandish nature might be expected of her .

		If she talked , dressed and conducted herself as any well-bred woman should , much astonishment was invariably evinced , and she was usually saluted with the tactful remark , ' I should never have thought that yoxi were an American , ' which was intended as a compli - ment . ''

		One could quote indefinitely from these pages , as so many of the stories and hon mots related by Lady ChurchiUare worth repeating ; and they are given with an air of easy frankness which adds greatly to their charm .

		At
Bayreuth	LOCATION	she met Mrs.
Sam Lewis	PERSON	, wife of the well-known money - lender ; an excellent musician , and a benefac - tress of many institutions .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	, unlike his wife , was not artistic .

		It is told of him that , having once made a fortnight 's stay in
Rome	LOCATION	, he was asked how he liked it . ''

		You can ` ave
Rome	LOCATION	, '' was his laconic answer .

		She met the Abbe Liszt at the
Russian Embassy	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, when
M. de Staal	ORGANIZATION	was Ambassador . ''

		THE DIAL 109 ated both by brush and chisel , seemed strangely familiar .

		He was so blind that he ate his asparagus by the wrong end , until I pointed out his error . '

		Ah , ' he exclaimed , -- ' merci bien , il me semblait tout de meme que cela n'etait pas tres bon ! ' ''

		On another occasion .

		Lady
Randolph	PERSON	was on a visit to
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, and tells the story of an officer , who , being on guard duty at the
Castle	ORGANIZATION	, was asked to dine there .

		The whispered conversation and the stiffness of the proceed - ings beginning to weigh on him , he thought he would enliven the party with a little joke .

		The Queen , hearing smothered laughter , asked what it was about .

		Scarlet and stammering , the poor man had to repeat his little tale , amid dead silence .

		Fixing a cold eye upon him , '' We are not amused , '' was all the
Queen	PERSON	said .

		Owing to her husband 's position as a Cabinet officer .

		Lady
Randolph	PERSON	had many opportunities of meeting prominent people of both political parties .

		The years 1880-1884 were stirring ones , and , she says , '' full of excitement and interest for me .

		Our house became the rendez - vous of all shades of politicians ... Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	and Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	came fre - quently .

		The
Duke of Marlborough	ORGANIZATION	, my father - in-law , was particularly incensed , and took
Randolph	PERSON	seriously to task for having had Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	to dinner , ' a man who was a socialist , or not far from one ; who was reputed to have refused to drink the Queen 's health when Mayor of
Birmingham	LOCATION	. ' ''

		It was a strange irony of fate that Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	some years later became one of the leading figures in English parliamentary life , honored and feted by
King Edward	PERSON	and his courtiers , and but for impaired health might probably still be one of the giants of the political arena .

		At that time the names of
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Salisbury	LOCATION	,
Hartington	LOCATION	,
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	,
Harcourt	LOCATION	, and
Stafford Northcote	PERSON	, were those to be conjured with .

		Balfour was then com - paratively unknown .

		He and Sir
John Gorst	PERSON	, with Sir
Henry Drummond Wolff	PERSON	and
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	, constituted what was known as the
Fourth Party	ORGANIZATION	, and many a lively tilt was exchanged between those obstreperous gentle - men and the occupants of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	benches .

		It is related that Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	con - fided to an intimate friend that he feared
Lord Randolph Churchill	PERSON	in debate even more than
Disraeli	LOCATION	.

		Lady
Randolph	PERSON	, in speaking of the banquet in honor of
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	and
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	on their return from the
Berlin	LOCATION	Con - ference , says that
Disraeli	PERSON	, pointing with a scorn - ful finger at Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, declared he was '' inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity . ''

		We believe that it was at the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and not at this banquet , that
Disraeli	PERSON	made these memorable remarks , and that
Gladstone	PERSON	later on retorted that it was `` the hair-brained chatter of irresponsible fri - volity . ''

		Lord
Randolph	PERSON	was just then at the zenith of his power , and much of his success may be attributed to his clever and vivacious wife .

		She assisted him in every possible manner , and was active on his behalf in public meetings and in canvassing for votes .

		In the
autumn of 1883	DATE	the
Primrose League	ORGANIZATION	was formed , and
Lady Randolph	PERSON	was enrolled as one of the dames .

		She spoke in
Manchester	LOCATION	just before the general elec - tion of
1886	DATE	, and prophesied the downfall of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	and the defeat of his famous Home Rule bill .

		Of this period she relates some amusing electioneering anecdotes .

		Being asked to help canvass for Mr.
Burdett-Coutts	PERSON	, she was pleading with a wavering voter for his support .

		Waggishly and with a sly look , he said , '' If I could get the same price as was once paid by the Duchess of Devonshire for a vote , I think that I could promise . '' ''

		Thank you very much , '' Lady
Randolph	PERSON	replied , '' I '11 let the
Baroness Burdett-Coutts	PERSON	know at once . ''

		Notwithstanding that
Lord Randolph Chur	PERSON	- chill rapidly rose to the highest positions , first as Secretary of State for
India	LOCATION	, and afterwards as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, his downfall was equally sensational .

		It was a great surprise and shock to the country when he tendered his resignation to the Queen .

		To Lady
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	it meant the destruction of all her hopes and plans . ''

		He went into no explanation , and I felt too utterly crushed and miserable to ask for any , or even to remonstrate , '' she writes in her journal .

		It was claimed , at the time , that
Lord Randolph	PERSON	disagreed with his colleagues on some question of expenditure .

		History may or may not be right in this respect ; but it is gen - erally believed that the state of his health , added to a naturally nervous temperament , was mainly responsible for his action .

		Lord
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	was a fearless fighter in debate , and a thorn in the side of his opponents .

		The press was very bitter against him , the '' Times '' in particular attack - ing him on every occasion .

		One night , after a particularly poisonous leader had appeared in that paper .

		Lady
Randolph	PERSON	met Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	, 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the editor of the '' Times , '' at a reception .

		Coming up , he half chaffingly asked her if she intended to speak to him , or if she was too angry . ''

		Not a bit , '' she replied , '' I have ten volumes of press-cuttings about Ran - dolph , all abusive .

		This will only be added to them . ''

		No record of Lady
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's Reminiscences would be complete without reference to the splendid work she accomplished in helping to fit out the hospital-ship ''
Maine	LOCATION	'' for service in the South African War .

		No stone was left unturned to procure money -- much money , and it had to be all American money . ''

		It would be useless , '' she says , '' to deny the fact that the Boer War was viewed with disfavor by my countrymen .

		They had a fellow feeling for the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	, fight - ing , as they thought , for their independence .

		But the plea of humanity overran their political opinions , and the fund once started , money poured in . ''

		As is often the case with char - itable appeals .

		Lady
Randolph	PERSON	and her co - workers met with rebuffs , -- notably in the case , as she tells , of an American multimillionaire to whom she cabled asking for a subscription for the hospital .

		He replied that he had '' no knowledge of the scheme . ''

		The press by this time , in both countries , was full of the enter - prise .

		She cabled back , '' Read the papers '' ; but this , alas !

		did not untie the rich man 's purse-strings .

		It may be asserted with perfect truth that
Lady Randolph	PERSON	did more to estab - lish an entente cordlale , and to help cement a friendship between
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, than could have been accomplished by any other means .

		Of her work in connection with '' The
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' we regret we can not speak so highly .

		That she was ill-advised to enter into the undertaking , no doubt remains .

		She did all she could to make the '' Review '' a success , and her friends helped her con amove .

		Advice was readily forthcoming , but not the means .

		The reasons for the failure of the enterprise are not far to seek ; it is generally conceded that the subscription price , for one thing , was pro- hibitory .

		That the scheme as a whole savored of snobbishness is self-evident ; and
Lady Randolph	PERSON	was shrewd enough to let go of it in time .

		This book is admirably illustrated and well made , but lacks an index .

		This is a great dis - advantage , especially as the author has an unfor - tunate habit of confusing dates and events .


George Robert Sparks	PERSON	.

		Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	as Historian .

		* The appearance of the two last volumes of Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	's '' History of Twenty-Five Years '' marks the passing of an historian who , if he is not to be classed among the greatest historical writers , was yet distinctly gifted in the art of historical presentation .

		Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	died on
July 7 , 1907	DATE	.

		He was con - nected , through both father and mother , with the so-called ruling class of
England	LOCATION	, and his life was in many respects the life of other men of his class and inherited tastes .

		Added to high culture , breeding , and education , was a consci - entious devotion to and interest in the routine administrative duties of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was a university man , and from early manhood mani - fested a desire to make a place for himself in the world of letters .

		Beginning as a clerk in the War Office , he held various administrative positions , such as Commissioner of Fisheries or Governor of the Isle of Man , his last office being that of Secretary of the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		These administrative labors constituted the everyday work of his life , and to them he gave a genuine interest and a sane energy .

		He was a good servant of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and was always welcome in political circles and society .

		Having an un - usually wide acquaintance with leaders in both parties , his opportunities for observation and judgment were many , while his essentially judi - cial and unbiassed mind fitted him peculiarly for the writing of contemporary history .

		His work , whether in the earlier history of
England	LOCATION	from
1815	DATE	to
1858	DATE	, or in this present history , planned and executed as a continuation , is always readable , and moves with a dignified precision , presenting its facts always clearly and injpressing them by sheer simplicity of statement .

		Indeed , the keynote of
Walpole	LOCATION	's attractive style of writing is simplicity -- a simplicity which , based upon a wide knowledge and true assimilation of facts , gives evidence of a logical mind and a discriminating pen .

		Clar - ity is characteristic of all his writing .

		His straightforward clear resume of events reads so simply that at first one may lose sight of the painstaking effort involved in achieving such satisfactory results .

		Doubtless it is advanta - geous to the general historian to be unhampered by the masses of tiresome detail that the mono - graphists must handle ; yet
Walpole	LOCATION	's sources were by no means meagre .

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 111 footnotes indicate a mastery of the most im - portant state papers , and the more accessible materials for a broader field than that custom - arily included within the labors of a specialist .

		He stands midway , therefore , between the spe - cialist and the `` popular historian , '' avoiding the dreary detail of the former and escaping the accusation of inexact knowledge frequently directed with justice against the latter .

		These general considerations apply to the two present volumes as well as to earlier work , even though these last volumes were incompleted at the time of the author 's death .

		Sir
A. C. Lyall	PERSON	, who had the duty of preparing them for the press , explains this when he states in the preface that his labor has been confined practically to slight alterations in the final re - view and arrangement of the manuscript , and that '' the views and conclusions recorded by Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	stand untouched as he wrote them . ''

		No one at all familiar with
Walpole	LOCATION	's method and style could doubt this ; for in the opinion of the reviewer it would be quite impossible to discover any appreciable difference between the method and style of these last volumes and those of earlier dates .

		And this is important ; for in addition to the value of his work as an exhibition of his his - torical study and writing ,
Walpole	LOCATION	's labors have the merit and interest of being the product of a keen , fair-minded , contemporary observer of the events which he narrates , and of one in close touch with all political leaders of note in
England	LOCATION	, yet not affected by political change and political animosities .

		His work has , there - fore , the value of a personal interpretation , representing first of all the view-point of the man himself , but going even further and repre - senting the view-point of a class , both in society and in permanent official position , that con - stitutes a steady and important factor in the history of
England	LOCATION	in the nineteenth century .

		The '' History of Twenty-Five Years '' is not merely a narrative of events ; it is also a careful presentation of both sides of each debatable incident , with a frankly expressed judgment of the Governmental treatment of that incident .

		Thus the history becomes itself historical mate - rial , as the expression of the historical judg - ments of a man and his class .

		When first undertaking this later work , the author stated that the period from
1856	DATE	to
1880	DATE	was unusually full of events demanding English interest in questions of foreign policy .

		He has therefore , in Volumes III .

		and IV. , continued to confine his attention largely to such questions .

		treating the topics of English diplomacy during the Franco-Prussian War , the Russo-Turkish War , and the
Berlin	LOCATION	Treaty of
1878	DATE	.

		These volmnes furnish an excellent analysis of condi - tions which it is to-day necessary to understand if one is to appreciate the strength and import - ance of present-day disturbances in the
Balkan States	LOCATION	.

		Nor is this a merely English point of view ; for
Walpole	LOCATION	, more than most Englishmen , knows his
Continental	ORGANIZATION	politics , and is able to avoid the insular limitations of other writers .

		As regards
America	LOCATION	, the main interest in the present volumes centres about the
Alabama	LOCATION	case and the
Geneva	LOCATION	Award ; and here , as every - where , the essentially judicial quality of Wal - pole 's mind is made evident .

		He is most fair in stating the argument for either side , acknowl - edging the impossible dilemma in which Lord
Russell	PERSON	placed
England	LOCATION	when he ordered the detention of the
Alabama	LOCATION	, yet denied that he was in any way bound to prevent her escape .

		At the same time , from the writer 's point of view , the proposal of Sumner to claim from
Great Britain	LOCATION	a sum equal to the entire cost of the Civil War , is equally preposterous .

		Walpole also points out with care one aspect of the
Alabama	LOCATION	arbitration that our American histo - rians are prone to neglect -- the important con - nection in the minds of English statesmen between the demand for damages by
America	LOCATION	and the Russian demand , in
1871	DATE	, for a reversal of the Black Sea provisions of the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The two demands had no real connec - tion save that of coincidence ; but this was not perfectly clear to the English Government . ''

		British statesmen , '' says
Walpole	LOCATION	, '' however ready they might be to uphold their country 's cause and their country 's honor , could not afford to disregard the combination of the great Empire of the
East	LOCATION	, with the gi'eat Republic of the
West	LOCATION	. ' '

		The importance here attributed to the effect of the Russian announcement upon the situation , in regard to the
Alabama	LOCATION	case , but illustrates the necessity of much deeper study than has hitherto been given to American diplomatic inci - dents .

		Our historical students and writers as a class have very largely lost sight of any save the two contending parties , when the
United States	LOCATION	has been one of the disputants ; whereas in fact , in incident after incident of American diplo - matic history , the foreign country with which we as a nation were in dispute was more largely controlled in its final action by concurrent poli - tical conditions in other European countries than by its disposition towards the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In connection with the
Alabama	LOCATION	case , it is 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, customary to say that the
United States	LOCATION	might have acquired British America , but preferred a litigious dispute for cash .

		This idea is but touched upon by
Walpole	LOCATION	, and at that in such a way as to create the impression that such an arrangement was never seriously entertained in
England	LOCATION	, even though the British minister at
Washington	LOCATION	and the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' did quite openly hint at it .

		This aspect of the case is not brought specifically forward , however , and the author enters no explicit denial for
England	LOCATION	.

		His great interest is in the European rather than in the American situation ; and here we find him at home in his estimates of men and in his analysis of events .

		Briefly recapitulated , the essential merits of
Walpole	LOCATION	's History are lucidity of statement and style , fair-mindedness , and a true assimila - tion of such material as was easily accessible .

		These qualities will render his work profitable and pleasant reading for many years , while the personal testimony of the author 's own opinions places his writing in the class of indestructible historical material .


Ephraim D. Adams	PERSON	.

		The Story of HERCuiiANEUM .

		* In setting forth the importance of
Hercula	LOCATION	- neum as a site for archaeological excavation .

		Professor Waldstein rides effusissimis habenis .

		He goes so far as to say that authorities con - cerned with classical antiquity are agreed that of all ancient sites , without exception ,
Hercula	LOCATION	- neum promises to yield the richest treasure to the excavator .

		He believes that '' the artistic treasure to be found there and the intellectual harvest to be reaped is greater than at
Rome	LOCATION	or
Athens	LOCATION	,
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	or
Olympia	LOCATION	,
Alexandria	LOCATION	or
Pergamon	LOCATION	. ''


Herculaneum	LOCATION	, moreover , is of greater archaeological importance than the other cities near
Vesuvius	LOCATION	-- Cumae ,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Stabiae	PERSON	, and
Pompeii	LOCATION	-- although each of these was larger .

		An instance is cited where a single villa excavated at Hereidaneum in the eighteenth century yielded greater treasure in original ancient bronzes , and more ancient manuscripts , than the excavation of
Athens	LOCATION	or
Rome	LOCATION	,
Olympia	PERSON	or
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	,
Alexandria	LOCATION	or
Pergamon	LOCATION	.

		The reasons given by Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	for his belief in the preeminence of
Herculaneum	LOCATION	as an archaeological site are of various kinds .

		The first and most important lies in the conditions *
Herculaneum	LOCATION	-- Past , Present , and Future .

		By
Charles Waldstein	PERSON	and
Leonard Shoobridge	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		under which the burial of the ancient town took place .

		The disaster which overtook it arrested its ancient life exactly as it was ; the city was hermetically sealed -- much more so than any other of the cities near
Vesuvius	LOCATION	.

		Its nearness to the volcano must be borne in mind ; for while
Pompeii	LOCATION	was five and three-fourths miles distant ,
Herculaneum	LOCATION	was only four and a half miles .

		Moreover , we know from the letters of the younger Pliny -LRB- Ep .

		VI. , 16 and 20 -RRB- that
Pompeii	LOCATION	was buried by the rain of ashes which the wind , blowing from the northwest , gradu - ally sent over the city .

		Even ultimately ,
Pom	PERSON	- peii was not completely buried , the lapilli and ashes not reaching a greater height than twenty feet , so that the upper stories of the houses were still uncovered after the eruption had ceased .

		Consequently , there was ample time in which to remove valuables .

		Hardly a house now remains whose walls were not broken into so as to admit those who were bent on carrying off its contents .

		In
Herculaneum	LOCATION	, on the other hand , there was no time to save valuables .

		The city was completely and immediately buried to a depth of from sixty to eighty feet .

		It was not gradually covered by a rain of ashes lasting for days , but suddenly , by a stream of mud which rolled down the slope over it .

		There was time for the inhabitants to escape from the town -LRB- and it may be noted in passing that very few human bodies have been found at
Hercula	LOCATION	- neum -RRB- , but time for collecting and carrying off valuables there could not have been .

		A second cause that makes
Herculaneum Tinique	ORGANIZATION	among archaeological sites is the singu - larly preservative quality of the mud that flowed through the streets and into the innermost recesses of the houses and other buildings .

		This mass of mud became a kind of matrix , covering and preserving th -LRB- ; forms it enveloped .

		The bronzes in the
Naples	LOCATION	Museum that have come from
Herculaneum	LOCATION	show a most delicate surface patina ; glass is not melted , marble is not cal - cined , even manuscripts are not damaged beyond the possibility of restoration .

		The mention of the manuscripts found in the villa of Piso -LRB- there were eight hundred of them -RRB- arouses the author 's imagination -- a quality in him , it would seem , of uncommon sensitiveness and power of respon - siveness ; and we have a flight of rhetoric , con - spicuous even in this rather over-rhetorical volume . ''

		In some viUa there , '' he writes , '' may be waiting for us aU the great Greek tragedians and writers of comedy , including Menander ; the works of the early Greek phil - osophers ,
Heracleitus	LOCATION	,
Parmenides	LOCATION	,
Empedocles	LOCATION	,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAl ^ 113 Democritiis ,
Anaxagoras	LOCATION	; the missing works of Plato and
Aristotle	LOCATION	; the whole of Roman liter - ature , the lost books of Livy . ''

		A further reason upon which Professor Waldstein lays emphasis in developing the theme of
Herculaneum	LOCATION	's importance is the evi - dence that it , unlike commercial
Pompeii	LOCATION	, was the home of many cultured families -- the
Balbi	LOCATION	, for example .

		Other illustrious Romans who lived here were
Servilia	LOCATION	,
Agrippina	LOCATION	,
Appius Claudius Pulcher	PERSON	, and
L. Calpurnius Piso	PERSON	.

		It was , in brief , a sort of
Roman Newport	ORGANIZATION	.

		Finally , says our author ,
Herculaneum	LOCATION	was originally a Greek settlement , as we see from its name ; and even if we can not go so far as to say that it preserved a pure Greek tradition from its earliest days , we may at least assume that it was more susceptible to the influence of Greek culture than
Pompeii	LOCATION	, which was of Oscan origin .

		At any rate , whatever the cause , the objects actually found in those parts of
Herculaneum	LOCATION	that have been excavated indicate a high degree of Greek culture .

		Over the chapters dealing with the past and present of
Herculaneum	LOCATION	we must pass briefly .

		The accounts of its topography , of the inhabit - ants , and of the disasters of 63 and 79 a. d. , give a sufficiently serviceable summary of our present knowledge of these subjects , without adding anything new .

		The contents of Chap - ter IV. , the '' History of the Site since the Eruption , '' will probably be less familiar to a majority of readers .

		It was in
the eighteenth century	DATE	that excavations of importance were first instituted , and were carried on under the auspices of
Charles III	PERSON	.

		of
Naples	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of the underground passages of the Theatre , these excavations no longer exist for us .

		Further attempts were made from
1828	DATE	-
1855	DATE	, and again from 1869-1875 .

		To this last period belong the parts which are now visible -- the so-called scavi nuovi , near the sea .

		Since 1 8 7 5 no further excavations have been attempted .

		The causes which led to the abandonment of the site are -LRB- 1 -RRB- the unusual facility of excavation at
Pompeii	LOCATION	, which promised immediate results for a comparatively small expenditure of money ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the fact that there is a flourishing modern town ,
Resina	LOCATION	, right over the ancient city ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the current belief that
Herculaneum	LOCATION	was covered with lava .

		This belief , the error of which has been pointed out , seems to have been partly due to the fact that there are patches of lava to be found here and there on the site of
Resina	LOCATION	.

		These , however , have come from erup - tions of Vesuvius in more recent times .

		The most noticeable part of Professor
Wald	PERSON	- stein 's volume -- the part that manifestly lies closest to the interest of the author -- is that on '' The Future of
Herculaneum	LOCATION	. ''

		His elaborate scheme for the international excavation of the site , a project upon which he worked with great energy from
1903	DATE	to
1907	DATE	, fell through .

		From the documents given in the Appendix it appears that he had succeeded in interesting King
Victor Immanuel	PERSON	,
King Edward	LOCATION	,
Emperor William	PERSON	, the
King of Sweden	ORGANIZATION	, President
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and many ambassadors and financiers .

		His plan was to form in each of the great countries a national committee , of which the
King	ORGANIZATION	, Emperor , or President , as the case might be , would be honorary chairman .

		This committee was to be broadly representative ; it was to include not only the rich and the cultured , but even mem - bers of labor-unions ; for , according to Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	, the workingman should be per - mitted , even stimulated , to contribute his penny to the great cause .

		These various national committees were to have their representatives on an international committee under whose immediate direction the excavation would be carried on .

		The honorary chairman of this international committee was to be the king of
Italy	LOCATION	, The actual work on the site was to be performed by a corps of a hundred experts of different nationalities , with workmen hired by them .

		It is the belief of the author that the plan almost succeeded .

		Its failure , he thinks , was due mainly to a misunderstanding on the part of Italian officials and the Italian press , who accepted as authoritative a garbled report of it which appeared in a
London	LOCATION	newspaper .

		But whatever the immediate occasion of the apparently sudden change of feeling among Italian officials , the underlying cause was obvi - ously the jealousy which
Italy	LOCATION	has always shown toward excavation by foreign archaeologists on Italian sites .

		She wishes to i. discover her own treasures .

		With the main thesis of the book , that Her - culaneum should be excavated , everyone will agree ; but in regard to
Professor Waldstein	LOCATION	's extremely positive assertions concerning the rich - ness of the treasure buried there , and his insist - ence on the preeminence of this over all other ancient sites , there will hardly be the same unanimity .

		Undoubtedly many valuable dis - coveries would be made there ; even a library that would be less disappointing than that of Piso 's villa might be found ; but few kinds of prophecy are more delusive than that which 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, forecasts the finds in an archaeological excava - tion .

		The book contains much material that is interesting ; but we believe the author would have been more convincing , and would have pro- moted his cause more effectively , if he had stated the facts in the case more soberly , -- if , in other words , he had given his readers more archae - ology and less rhetoric .

		Professor Waldstein 's efforts have not been wholly in vain .

		The Italian government lias announced that it will excavate
Herculaneum	LOCATION	, and has appropriated 15,000 francs as a begin - ning .

		In his plan of complete excavation , Professor Waldstein estimated that the cost would be X40 ,000 a year .

		On the mechanical side , the book is beauti - fully made .

		The illustrations are numerous and unusually well executed ; paper , printing , and binding leave nothing to be desired .

		liETTERS OF THE WiFE OF A GREAT Political , Ijeader .

		* The rush of really important events of the past few years , as well as their excess of empty din , causes the letters of Mrs.
Blaine	PERSON	to seem like an echo from a much remoter period than their dates attest .

		There is real rest to the weary soul , however , in dropping back into a political field even no more quiet , compara - tively , than that upon which
Blaine	PERSON	deployed his forces .

		Mrs.
Blaine	PERSON	at her best was a bright and witty woman , and her letters would stand on their own merits far above many which get into print ; but , after all , it is the political connection which gives them their chief interest .

		Hence it is the inevitable impression that they have been a little too thoroughly culled , for the sake of avoiding offense , that will be felt by many as their main defect .

		Mrs.
Blaine	PERSON	was no mere colorless reflector of her husband 's opinions and prejudices , and the touches of personal feeling which have been preserved in her letters are often both amusing and effective .

		For instance , just after Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	had written his famous letter from abroad withdrawing himself from the race for the Republican nomination in
1888	DATE	, she writes : `` I had a sweet letter from Mr.
Morton	PERSON	, calling your Father 's letter a master - piece , and not seeing how it could be accepted .

		Y ^ ou can trust
John Sherman	PERSON	for seeing ^ how - • The Letters of Mrs.
James G. Blaine	PERSON	.

		ever . ''

		Unfavorable comment on various com - peting Republican leaders is not infrequent , President
Hayes	PERSON	suffering perhaps the most severe treatment -- a fact which in itself helps to show that the
Blaine	PERSON	point of view of American politics was not that which was destined to live .

		With half the country feeling that his title to his seat was at least questionable , and a large share of his own party in opposition to his dis - tinctive policies .

		President
Hayes	PERSON	had a heavy load to carry ; but time and thought have placed the honor and wisdom of his official con - duct out of reach of successful attack .

		One looks in vain for any criticism of the Democrat who foiled Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	's ambitions in the one case in which he succeeded in capturing the nomination from opponents within his own party .

		Mrs.
Blaine	PERSON	's letters are almost all to members of her immediate family , and they were aU at home during the
1884	DATE	campaign .

		There were ample opportunities for the expression of opinion , however , during President
Cleveland	LOCATION	's admin - istration , and one is doubtless safe in the con - clusion that he owes his immunity to the kindness of the editor , and not to the forbearance of Mrs.
Blaine	PERSON	.

		Her loyalty to her brilliant husband was of course too great to allow her to appreciate in any adequate degree the defects which marred a really great natural endowment ; but no gen - erous reader will blame her for that .

		He would be an enemy indeed to the human race who would take from love its traditional right to be blind .

		Those who know the whole story , how - ever , can hardly avoid the feeling that it would have been better to withhold these letters from publication .

		The contrast between the cheerful family life of the earlier years and the gather - ing gloom toward the end is too painful for the public gaze .

		The editor herself feels the terribly depressing effect , and closes with the letters of
1889	DATE	, frankly stating that she lacks the courage to look farther . ''

		The path that the writer was called upon to follow was already passing under the shadow of a great grief , and was to lead on , from sorrow to sorrow , into a darkness that never was lifted in this life . ''

		There are occasional mistakes in the explan - atory footnotes which a proof-reader of ordinary intelligence ought to have challenged , -- as , for instance , a reference to
Preston S. Banks	PERSON	as the assailant of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	.

		Of course it was right to print Mrs.
Blaine	PERSON	's letters '' wart and all , '' but errors in the notes stand on quite a different basis .

Charles Lamb	PERSON	writes of names in our
Thackeray	PERSON	's literature that have a iragrance in daughter .

Marlowe	PERSON	and
Drummond of Hawthornden	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are names , too , that have echoes in them ; and to those of us who care for our English heritage , Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	's name has in it echoes of all that we delight to honor in literary
England	LOCATION	of the Victorian past -- that past which was the present so short a while ago , yet seems to have receded into the shadow so much farther than the actual count by the almanac would warrant .

		Thackeray 's daughter is one of the few whose voice can make the shadow real to us , and Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	's new book , '' Blackstick Papers '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is like the gift she tells us of , made by ''
Jacob Omnium	PERSON	'' to her father -- a cup in which some of us may still drink to the past .

		An
Alabama Student	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Biographical Essays '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a substantial octavo giving the general reader a more satisfying taste of the writer 's quality than has yet been afforded .

		The title chap - ter deals with the least famous , but not therefore the least deserving , subject of the thirteen embraced in the book .

		Dr.
John Y. Bassett	PERSON	of
Alabama	LOCATION	, who died at forty-six after a useful and active life , becomes in Dr.
Osier	PERSON	's hands an interesting char - acter .

		Then follow short studies of

O. W. Holmes	PERSON	,
John Locke	PERSON	as a physician ,
William Pepper	PERSON	,
Alfred Stills	PERSON	, Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	,
Harvey	PERSON	, and others less renowned in medicine or surgery or literature , but all more or less honorably associated with that profession which is the writer 's own .

		Of personal interest is it to learn that the ''
Religio Medici	PERSON	, '' in
James T. Fields	PERSON	's edition of
1862	DATE	, has been Dr.
Osier	PERSON	's companion since his school days and is the most precious book in his library , which also contains an '' almost complete collection of the editions of his -LSB-
Browne	PERSON	's -RSB- works . ''

		What Dr.
Osier	PERSON	notes as true of
Burton	LOCATION	,
Browne	PERSON	, and Fuller -- that they have '' a rare quaintness , a love of odd conceits , and the faculty of apt illustrations drawn from out - of-the-way sources '' -- is , by a psychological neces - sity , in some measure true of himself .

		His style , too , is enriched with a rare blend of subtle allusion and veiled quotation .

		Probably not every hearer of these addresses caught the full flavor of such passages as the following incidental reference to the coming quater-centenary of the birth of
Caius	LOCATION	, co-founder of
Caius College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	: '' As well in love as in gratitude , we could celebrate it in no more appropriate manner , and in none that would touch his spirit more closely , than by the issue of a fine edition of his principal works . ''

		Among the few and fitting illustrations in the book is a portrait of
Browne	PERSON	from a little-known original at
Norwich	LOCATION	-- a most pleasing and satisfying presentment .

		One could wish that Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	had bden included among these excellent sketches of medico-literary worthies .

		The building of ^ he history and development of a great State in
Minnesota	LOCATION	may be taken as typical the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, ^ f t ^ e
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and the volume on that
State	ORGANIZATION	in the '' American Commonwealths '' series -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has for this reason a general interest that is added to the intrinsic interest of the story .

		The book has been carefully and skilfully written by Professor
William W. Folwell	PERSON	, for many years connected with the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are several main currents of interest followed by the narrative .

		First come the dealings of the traders and settlers with the former possessors of the soil .

		It is the old story of over-reaching through trickery and fraud , through treaties to which the simple children of the prairie who knew not what they promised were held with literal fidelity , while the gi'eedy trader or lumberman could break them at his pleasure .

		Even of the petty sum awarded the Indians for the vast stretches of their lands , very little reached them , and then only to be squandered for whiskey , -- the old shameful story .

		Another current of interest is in the rush of settlers , the organization of Territorial and
State	ORGANIZATION	governments , and the rainbow schemes for getting land from the
Government	ORGANIZATION	through sham railroad and other com - panies .

		Not at all creditable is the history of the five-million loan , the bonds for which the
State	ORGANIZATION	long 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, endeavored to repudiate because it secured nothing of value in return ; but as wealth grew and the pub - lic conscience became more sensitive , a fair settle - ment was finally reached and the credit of the
State	ORGANIZATION	was saved .

		A third feature is the serious
Sioux	LOCATION	outbreak of
1862	DATE	, which occurred while a large part of the defenders of the
State	ORGANIZATION	were at the front in the Civil War .

		This was one of the severest of the Indian disturbances , and the tradition of it remains to this day among the people .

		The state - ment of the causes of the trouble shows that the Indians were not without reasons for anger against those who had tricked and cheated them , even though much of the vengeance fell in this case , as always , upon innocent persons .

		„ , Back to the homely realities eoes Some simple - .

		material for his book , `` A Poor Man 's House '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		In a general way its tone is like that of another very real and wholesomely enjoyable narrative which is being much read at present , -- namely , '' A Lord of Lands , '' by Mr.
Ramsey Benson	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	's book is the veritable journal of actual adventures and observations among the poor fisherfolk of a little Devonshire seaport , whereas Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, with all his verisimilitude , is obviously not hampering his genius with a strict adherence to the literal truth .

		The English writer 's
summer	DATE	sojourn in the humble home of the
Widger	PERSON	family is related with minuteness and humor , and with no squeamish avoidance of sundry very human and lifelike details that hardly admit of much ideal - ization .

		He tells us that he has lived among the poor , '' neither as parson , philanthropist , politician , inspector , sociologist , nor statistician ; but simply because I found there a home and more beauty of life and more happiness than I had met with else - where . ''

		It is his firm belief , too , that '' as regards the things that really matter , the educated man has more to learn of the poor man than to teach him . ''

		It may comfort us a little amid all the appalling accounts that reach us of widespread and extreme destitution in
London	LOCATION	and throughout the country , to be assured that '' the more intimately one lives among the poor , the more one admires their amaz - ing talent for happiness in spite of privation , and their magnificent courage in the face of uncertainty ; and the more also one sees that these qualities have been called into being , or kept alive , by uncertainty and thriftlessness ... Extreme thrift , like extreme cleanliness , has often a singularly dehumanizing effect . ''

		There is abundance of homely dialect con - versation , not needing a glossary , however ; and the realistic story throughout is well worth reading .

		Dolls and doll-lore .

		Some years ago Miss
Laura B. Starr	PERSON	lost her heart to the Japanese dolls in the
Yokohama	LOCATION	shops , and thereupon she began collecting dolls and doll-lore .

		A six years ' tour around the world gave her unusual opportunities to indulge her unusual fad , and now `` The Doll Book '' -LRB-
Outing Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the delightful result .

		She dedicates her studies '' To all who are interested in dolls , from the children who play with them to the students of their ethnological and educational aspects , '' -- which sounds impossible until one has read the book , looked at the pictures , many of them in color , and come to realize the universality of the passion for dolls and the odd varieties of its expres - sion .

		There are fetish dolls , for instance , and dolls of the nativity , puppets , fashion dolls , and dolls with supposedly supernatural powers -- like the Blessed Bambino at
Rome	LOCATION	, or the dolls in the
Asakusa Temple	LOCATION	in Tokio ; particularly among primitive peo - ples , there are doll rites and doll festivals ; and the history of the doll , and of some historic dolls , is full of interest .

		Little girls may not care particularly for these strange creatures nor for the crude dolls of antiquity ; but they will vastly enjoy hearing about the tilt-up dolls of the
East	LOCATION	, the Japanese dolls with their five wigs to represent the five stages of woman - hood , the wooden dolls that the little Queen Victoria dressed , the Dutch and Irish dolls in peasant cos - tume , the manufacture of dolls in various parts of the world , and the vast possibilities of home manu - facture out of such unpromising material as string , corn-husks , flowers , or bottles .

		Miss
Starr	PERSON	has been skilful in arranging her material , so that in spite of its diversity of interests the book seems complete rather than heterogeneous .

		As befits its subject , '' The Doll Book '' is gaily bound , with a Spanish doll in sailor costume on the cover , and many pic - tures , made largely from the dolls in
Miss Starr	LOCATION	's valuable and interesting collection .

New England	LOCATION	dis - trict school , before continuing his education beyond the three R 's at the
PhiUips Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Andover	LOCATION	, and at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Andover years fell within the period when such worthies as

G. N. Anthony	PERSON	,
Calvin E. Stowe	PERSON	,

		Mr.
Mowry	PERSON	's experiences as student , teacher , captain of volimteers in the Civil War , editor of educational journals , superin - tendent of schools , lecturer , and head of teachers ' institutes , are entertainingly presented , with por - traits and other illustrations , and numerous remin - iscences of famous educators of his time .

May 16 , 1907	DATE	, we spoke of the reviving interest in the course of
Greek History	ORGANIZATION	from
1204	DATE	to
1566	DATE	.

		Now we have another careful study of the same period , bearing the title '' The Latins in the Levant '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
William Miller	PERSON	, already known as the writer of several works on various parts of the '' Near East . ''

		Our author loves his subject , -- '' this most fascinating stage in the life of
Greece	LOCATION	'' ; he has an enviable familiarity with the geography involved ; he understands that he is dealing with very living creatures , instead of mere archaeological material ; and , above all , he has worked faithfully and long at his diverse and often difficult sources .

		The outcome is a volume of nearly seven hundred pages , which may be commended to the student or the exceptionally earnest traveller .

		In itself the period is not quite so enchainingly attractive as our author insists .

		That '' the romance , the poetic haze of
Greece	LOCATION	was in her middle ages , rather than in her classic youth , '' may be entirely true for the writer , and partly true for a few of us ; to most readers , however , it will seem largely a matter of personal predilection .

		Nor can we altogether agree that
Frankish Greece	ORGANIZATION	has been unduly neglected , at least by recent students .

		Just now it is assuredly receiving its proportionate share of attention .

		Mr.
Miller	PERSON	writes clearly and succinctly ; but he does not exhibit the final grace of style that might carry the general reader through the inevitable details of a painstaking history treating of countless and ephemeral petty dynasties .

		The use of ''
Levant	PERSON	'' in the title is rather unfortunate , since most people understand the word quite differently , and our author himself frequently uses it in the more com - mon acceptation .

		The index and the maps are useful ; but the valuable bibliography might have been arranged more conveniently .

		A new edition of '' A Histoiy of P.SS.t '' '' ^ ^ `` Philippines , '' by Dr.
David P. Barrows	PERSON	, director of education in those islands , comes from the press of The Bobbs -
Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Indianapolis	LOCATION	.

		It is practically iden - tical with the original edition of
1905	DATE	, the author having found himself unable to agree with the many criticisms of the book that came from '' Roman Catholic sources .

		The history of
the Philippines	LOCATION	has yet to be written , in the modern sense of the word .

		The summary by Mr.
John Foreman	PERSON	, the work in English that is most commonly cited as an authority , is a mere hodge-podge of information and misinformation .

		This little work by Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	-LRB- originally written for a Philippine school text , but never so used -RRB- and the introduction written by the late
Edward G. Bourne	PERSON	for the 55-volume work en - titled '' The Philippine Islands , 1493-1898 , '' are the only surveys of the entire field of Philippine history which are written by competent scholars and in the modern spirit .

		Both are necessarily brief and incomplete ; but that by Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	is much fuller of data , and based on a wider reading of Philippine sources .

Langton Douglas	PERSON	.

		Issued as Volume II .

		of the ''
Viking Club Trans	ORGANIZATION	- lation Series , '' we have '' The Elder or Poetic
Edda	PERSON	, '' in a translation by Miss Olive Bray , with illustrations by Mr.
W. G. Collingwood	PERSON	.

		This volume includes the mythological poems only , and each page of the trans - lation faces one upon which the original text is printed .

		There is an elaborate introduction and commentary , besides occasional footnotes .

		`` What We Know about Jesus , '' by Dr.
Charles F. Dole	PERSON	, is a small book sent us by the
Open Court Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lishing Co. .

		It is a simple popular statement , of '' posi - tive , ethical , and constructive '' intent , of the view which modern investigation discloses of the personality of the Founder of Christianity . ''

		Who 's Who '' for
1909	DATE	, published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is thicker than ever , filling nearly twenty-two hundred pages .

		We would suggest the omission from future editions of the American names , now so capri - ciously selected , and so well provided for in the Amer - ican work of similar scope .

		Miss
Alice B. Kroeger	PERSON	has prepared a new edition of her '' Guide to the Study and Use of Reference Books '' for the use of students and library assistants .

		The work has been greatly enlarged and correspondingly increased in usefulness .

		It is a publication of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Old English Plate , '' by
W. J. Cripps	PERSON	, published thirty years ago , has been for that time a standard man - ual for the collector , having gone through no less than nine editions .

		An abbreviation of the work , entitled '' The Plate Collector 's Guide , '' prepared by Mr.
Percy Macquoid	PERSON	, is now published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons . ''

		The Works in Prose and Verse of
Charles	LOCATION	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Thomas Hutchinson	PERSON	, fill two volumes of the ''
Oxford Edition of Standard Authors	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		To the same series is also added '' The Complete Poetical Works of
James Thomson	PERSON	, '' in one volume , edited by Mr.
J. Logic Robertson	PERSON	.

		This is a variorum edition , for which students will be particularly thankful .

		Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's famous '' Ten O'clock '' has been reprinted by Mr.
Ernest Dressel North	PERSON	, and issued as a booklet , tastefully bound in paper covers of a Whistlerian brown with the inevitable butterfly by way of decoration .

		The reprint , which has the rare dis - tinction of having been authorized by the author 's liter - ary executor , is the only separate edition of the lecture now in print .

		The
Pennell	PERSON	biography and the remin - iscences of Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	, -- which unfortunately Miss
Philip	PERSON	did not authorize , -- have revived interest in
Whistler	LOCATION	's personality ; and that personality never , surely , had more final expression than in the crisp , auda - cious phrases of this heretical gospel of art , which set
London	LOCATION	agog and forever severed the friendship between
Whistler	LOCATION	and
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		Five volumes recently added to the '' Belles Lettres Series '' of
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	range over English literature from the earliest to the latest period .

		Old English is represented by the '' Exodus '' and the ''
Daniel	PERSON	, '' edited by Professor
Francis A. Blackburn	PERSON	.

		The drama is represented by Professor
Edgar C. Morris	PERSON	's edition of '' The Spanish Gipsie '' and `` All 's Lost by Lust , '' by
Middleton	PERSON	and
Rowley	PERSON	, and by Otway 's '' The Orphan '' and ''
Venice	LOCATION	Preserved , '' in one volume edited by Professor
Charles F. McClumpha	PERSON	.

		The section of nineteenth-century poetry is now enlarged by volumes of selections from
Shelley	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	, the former edited by Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	, and the latter by Professor
Edward E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. .

		We do not understand why these two volumes should have no portraits , or frontispiece illustrations of any sort .

		Otherwise , they follow the general plan of their prede - cessors in the series .

		We may sometimes get the best instruction in our own concerns by going far afield , and there is a lesson even for American schools in the candid revelations of the writer who , in the last '' Contemporary Review , '' describes the results of his efforts to teach English literature to East Indian students .

		The Indian Educa - tional
Service	ORGANIZATION	prescribes -LRB- how dear is prescrip - tion to the managerial heart ! -RRB-

		certain English classics for use in the instruction of ingenuous Mussulman and Hindu youth . ''

		Paradise Lost , '' the odes of
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, '' The Vanity of Himian Wishes , ''
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's essay on
Warren Hastings	PERSON	, and the '' Breakfast Table '' books of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, are examples of the strangely - assorted provender thus provided .

		The sort of mental indigestion caused by this pabulum is amusingly illustrated by our writer , who entered upon his task with much enthusiasm , determined `` to demolish what is artificial and affected in literature , and reverently to discover and enshrine what is spontaneous and true . ''

		But East is East and
West is West	LOCATION	, as has been remarked before , and our ambitious teacher was not long in rediscovering the fact for himself .

		He had been at his post only a few days when one of his students made an unconsciously happy emendation of Milton : '' Hail , horrors !

		hail Infernal World !

		And thou , profoundest Hell Receive thy new Professor . ''

		A few days later , the '' new professor '' received some insight into the nature of his task when at work with a class upon '' The Vanity of Human Wishes . ''

		In a misguided moment he ventured a quotation from '' Adonais '' for the purpose of effective contrast : '' He has outsoared the shadow of our night ; Envy and calumny and hate and pain .

		And that unrest which men miscall delight .

		Shall touch him not , and torture not again . ''

		Then he questioned the class concerning the dif - ference in style and treatment . ''

		What would you say was the characteristic of this kind of poetry ? '' ''

		Bombasticity , '' said one ; '' humor , '' said another . ''

		Good heavens !

		Where ? ''

		Was the amazed query of the teacher . ''

		In ' that unrest which men miscall delight . '

		The humor depends on incongruity . ''

		Whereupon the 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, teacher wrote to the authorities , asking them to spare
Shelley	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	. ''

		Let us be sacri - ficers , but not butchers . ''

		This appeal resulted in a prescription of more
Keats	PERSON	-LRB- on the theory , evidently , that the boys must be made to under - stand it -RRB- including the two great odes .

		Here is a specimen result : '' Away !

		away !

		for I will fly to thee Not charioted by
Bacchus	PERSON	and his pards , But on the viewless wings of Poesy , '' -- suffered paraphrase as follows : '' Fly away and I will dog thy steps , but I will not come to thee by taking seat in the carriage of God of Wine and
Leopard	ORGANIZATION	.

		I will accompany you in flying by reciting and writing poems . ''

		All this seems painfully familiar to us , not merely as an illustration of baboo English , which has amused us many a time and oft , but chiefly as a far-off reflection of the experience of all teachers here in our own native land .

		It is the same sort of thing as the classical example recorded by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	when he told us of the English child who gave '' Can you not wait upon the lunatic ? ''

		as embodying his notion of what Shakespeare meant by the question , '' Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased ? ''

		And the explanation , whether offered for
India	LOCATION	, or
England	LOCATION	, or
America	LOCATION	, is the same simple one .

		If a child be confronted with literature that is absolutely beyond his powers of comprehension , and asked to express his opinion , he will make just such a mess of his ideas .

		Yet we persevere in our fatuous attempt to make school children appreciate the things which we think they ought to appreciate , and then hold up our hands in horror at the natural consequences .

		It is a hypocritical horror , for we get just what we have every reason to expect , and we shall continue to get it until we learn the simple lesson that liter - ature is not to be taught as we teach algebra , and physics , and syntax , and geography ; is not , in fact , to be '' taught '' at all in the accepted sense of the word , but rather '' imparted '' or '' inculcated '' by the contagion of a child 's sym - pathy , and the free response of his nature to a guidance so gentle that he does not feel it to be either coercion or restraint .

		The `` English '' course -LRB- we had almost writ - ten '' curse '' -RRB- which has come during the past quarter-century to have so tenacious a grip upon our school machinery demonstrates its own ineffectiveness year after year , but its talons are not relaxed .

		Let us rather have more and more of it is the cry , and perhaps we shall begin to get results worth mentioning .

		It is as if physi - cians should urge that , since average children are predisposed to certain ailments at certain ages , they should all be dosed alike with certain standard drugs , and then , finding the degree of ailment not perceptibly diminished , that physi - cians should recommend a doubling of the bolus or a stiffening of the black draught .

		Of course , no physician of the body could be guilty of this absurdity of treating his patients en bloc , but our physicians of the developing soul are practis - ing this method all the time .

		It is a matter in which individual idiosyncrasy counts for every - thing , and yet the individual is almost wholly ignored .

		The humane and intelligent teacher can do something to mitigate the evils of a pre - scribed literary discipline , but the system rests upon him like a dead weight , and the best that he is able to accomplish seems trifling in com - parison with what he knows that he might accom - plish were he given a free hand .

		The two ideals are as unlike as
night	TIME	and day .

		The irrational ideal gives the teacher a class and a list of texts and bids him administer the one to the other .

		The rational ideal gives the teacher a roving commission to explore the minds of his individual students , to use his own means of lighting up the dark places , and to experiment , by selecting from the whole range of literature , until he discovers what will prove most richly nutritive in each given instance .

		Reverting to our earlier metaphor , he has the whole pharma - copseia at his disposal , instead of being restricted to the use of a few standardized preparations , and he may engage freely in diagnosis , because he knows himself free to provide the proper treatment for each individual case .

		We do not hesitate to say that a very large part of the instruction in English now given in our schools is sheer waste of time and energy .

		It fails to create an intelligent comprehension of literary art or a feeling for its beauty and emotional significance .

		The facts of literature -- its history and its mechanics -- may be drilled into the mind by ordinary methods of teaching , but the spirit that gives them life is to be trans - mitted only by some subtler process , not capable of formvdation by any sort of pedagogy .

		As long as the teaching of literature is carried on in accordance with the rules of the system , by means of imposed texts and class-exercises and periodical examinations , it is certain to fail of its real purpose .

		Better no instruction at aU than instruction of the systematic kind which may accomplish admirable results in science , but which is worse than useless in aesthetics and ethics .

		If it be urged that the sort of literary guidance which we assert to be alone effective
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 129 can not be fitted into our programmes , or made to square with our administrative rules , we can only say that both programmes and rules must be disregarded if we wish to keep literature in our education at all as a vital subject .

		A great deal of pedagogical inertia will have to be over - come before this principle shall win practical acceptance , but the goal is worth striving for , and its ultimate attainment is beyond question .

		CREATION AND CRITICISM .

		I am far from believing that literature is only a criticism of life .

		Creation and criticism are as much opposed as synthesis and analysis -- the put - ting together and the taking apart .

		Indeed , they are further removed ; for the putting together im - plies a conscious act , whereas the greatest effects in literature are given to the artist .

		After his work in assembling his materials and placing them in a mould is done , it requires the fusing fire of inspira - tion to weld them together and make them into a new whole .

		But it is doubtful whether anything is given to the artist who does not strive -- whether the light - ning flash will descend upon any altar which is not heaped with combustibles .

		Observation , study , con - scious judgments , the acceptance or rejection of this or that quality or material , all these operations are necessary to the construction of a work of art , and they are all critical operations .

		It follows that a good literary artist must be a good critic .

		The part which the naive , the unconscious , the untrained faculties of man play in the production of literature was over-insisted upon in the criticism of the last century .

		It was held then that literature was the spontaneous speech of man ; that the folk - lores , mythologies , ballad poetry , and early epics were the work of natural geniuses .

		The great existing epics of the world were divided into two classes , the naive and the artificial .

		As far as they are con - cerned , this position is abandoned to-day .

		It is seen that as much thought and conscious art must have gone to the making of the `` Iliad '' as of '' Paradise Lost . ''

		But still , as regards the slighter form of literature , the old idea of spontaneous crea - tion lingers . ''

		These books were not made by fools , or for the use of fools , '' said
Thomas Moore	PERSON	of the early Irish legends and poems .

		The beginnings of most literatures are lost in mist , so that we can not tell how they arose or what manner of men pro- duced them .

		But the Irish and Welsh bardic sys - tems are revealed to us in something more than glimpses , and we can see that they were keenly critical and entirely conscious attempts to produce literature .

		Nothing in our modern world is like the consecration , the training , the control which these systems suggest -- unless it may be De Maupassant 's apprenticeship to
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Celtic bards be - lieved that inspiration was a result , not a cause ; and their works prove that they were largely right .

		From the example of their schools it may fairly be argued that something of the same sort existed in the early life of most nations .

		For it is another mistake to suppose that the first poets of any race are the best .

		On the contrary , it takes a long time for the language , the ideals , the very life of a people , to be got into shape fit for literature .

		Leaving races and coming down to individuals , there are two main ways in which a writer begins artistic creation .

		One is the way of imitation : something in the literature of the past pleases him , stimulates him , and he tries to copy it .

		The other is the way of revolt : the work that is being done around him disgusts him , -- he says , `` That is not true , that is not life or beauty as I see them , '' and he strikes out a method of his own .

		The imitative incentive accounts for the long reigns of certain types or forms or styles in literature .

		The rebellious motive explains the sudden changes , reversions , or originations which every now and then sweep over literature .

		Some writer or group of writers revolts against the rule that seemed good to their fathers , and , drawing a third part of the kingdom of litera - ture after them , set up a new government , which in turn becomes conventional or despotic .

		It is obvious that the literature of appreciation and the literature of rebellion alike have their beginning in a critical attitude .

		The reason that the critical movements in the past -- the ebb and flow of opinion -- are not so apparent as they are in modern times , is that there was then little market for criticism as such .

		Authors published their main works , but all their preparatory studies and sketches were destroyed .

		Their private opinions about life and art , their shop-talk among themselves , their letters , were all criticism , and all aided in making their works what they are ; but whereas now all this is largely caught and preserved and published , in olden times it only lived as the rain and sunlight of the past live in the corn and wine they mature .

		Imagine a
Boswell	PERSON	or an
Ecker	PERSON	- mann for
Shakespeare !	ORGANIZATION

		Two-thirds of modern criticism would have been superfluous .

		Shakespeare began with the imitative mood , -- if , as I believe is probable , '' Titus Andronicus '' and `` The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	'' are his earliest works ; but in '' Love 's Labour Lost '' he sets up the banner of critical revolt .

		Throughout this piece he is making fun of the existing styles in dramatic poe - try ; and
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Greene	PERSON	,
Lyly	PERSON	, the objects of his previous admiration , come in for unsparing satire .

		After this he became so various and universal in the excellencies he aimed at and reached , that it is diffi - cult to follow the critical trend of his mind -- to decide whether he is idealist or realist , conscious stylist or naive producer of poetry .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	was a determined critic , and his plays are built up with rigid regard to rule and authority ; but criticism as a trade was hardly born in English literature until
Dryden	PERSON	's time .

		His prefaces , which 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Swift declared were '' writ to fill in , and raise the volume 's price a shilling , '' are admirable in the quality they profess , and they show that he '' learned by teaching . ''

		The eighteenth century in
England	LOCATION	has been called a critical age ; but I think it is just the reverse .

		Dominated by two great writers ,
Dryden	PERSON	and Pope , yet not quite satisfied with them , it was afraid to trust itself to new or original forms of thought in literature , and it vacillated between servile copying of its master 's work and feeble attempts at some - thing different .

		It was a choppy sea with no g ^ eat ground-swell on .

		Not until the Romantic revival came in sight , with its forerunners in
Collins	LOCATION	,
Gray	LOCATION	,
Chatterton	LOCATION	, and
Blake	PERSON	, and its culminating kings , in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	, was there a real critical movement .

		There can be no question that this movement was a conscious one .


Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	did not do their work out of impulse and feeling ; they were intellectually alive to the change they desired to bring about :
Wordsworth	PERSON	's first poems are Popeian in form , and
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's early pieces are mainly mild imitations of Gray and
Collins	PERSON	.

		But they came together , and the flint and steel were struck to light a blaze of revolution .

		As is the case of most reformers , they were partly uncertain in their principles and partly demonstrably wrong .

		Late in life ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	declared that he never thought very much of his famous preface to the '' Lyrical Ballads , '' and that he wrote only it to please
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ; but at the time it was doubtless real and earnest enough to him .

		It is not worth while to go through the histories of the other great movements in modern literature -- the German revolt against French models captained by
Lessing	PERSON	and Herder and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the revolt of the French themselves under Hugo and
Dumas	PERSON	against their own classical literature , the advent of the real - ists , and so on .

		My point simply is that creation in the main is born of criticism -- that artists generally know what they are doing , be their deeds ever so mistaken ; and also that practically all writers , even though not swept away in any great movement , begin and continue their work in a critical attitude ; that each one has his compass and chronometer , and takes his bearings from day to day instead of drift - ing idly about on the ocean of art .

		It is an old jest that the critic is the man who has failed in creation .

		Well , then , three-fourths of our greatest moderns must have failed , for at least that proportion have left vast outpourings of criti - cism , either in the form of recorded conversations , letters , or formal treatises .

		Lessing is equally great in critical and creative work , and one might almost dare to say the same of Goethe .


Wagner	PERSON	's critical works are a huge reservoir of good , bad , and in - different opinions .

		Hugo 's deliverances are com - paratively few in number , but they make up in intensity what they lack in extent .

		Coleridge and
Arnold	LOCATION	, the two greatest English critics , are unset - ting stars in our poetic field .

		The letters of
Byron	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	are full of glittering nuggets of criticism , and there are a good many in those of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		In
America	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	, and a score of others are Janus-faced and have their outlook equally on the peace of poetry and the war of criticism .

		Among the best of modern men I can recall only one ,
Dickens	PERSON	, who seems to have written no criti - cism ; and only one absolutely great critic ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	, who did nothing that can be called creative work .

		Criticism would therefore seem to be almost a necessity to the creative artist .

		The Greeks sur - rounded their pregnant women with beautiful statues and pictures ; and the preoccupation with the divine , noble , or terrible forms and thoughts of past litera - ture should and undoubtedly does aid in the shaping of new works .

		But when all that criticism can do for an artist is wrought , there yet remains something that he nmst hope and pray for -- the daemoniac , the inspirational element in art , from which comes its intoxicating , its enchanting spell .

		By this the man is lifted to converse with the gods , and he comes back with his face aglow and their language upon his lips .

		No amount of critical study or preparation can guarantee to him this translation of soul .

		But he can keep himself ready for it , and that is the chief object of criticism .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The readable quality of book-lovers ' books , of publications issued by or for associations of biblio - philes , is sometimes conspicuously absent .

		In a recent address on '' The Functions of the Book Club , '' delivered before the
Rowfant Club of Cleve	ORGANIZATION	- land , Mr.
Henry H. Harper	PERSON	, treasurer of the Bibliophile Society of
Boston	LOCATION	, caused his hearers to sit up and pay attention by asking the startling but pertinent question : '' Why do book clubs insist on bringing forth books that are the least readable ? ''

		Most book-lovers , as he remarked , are collectors to a greater or less degree ; but many collectors who hoard books in considerable numbers are not book - lovers in the true sense .

		In considering the issue , by book clubs , of a particular sort of unfascinating literature , he said : '' For my part , however , the bibliographies will be reserved till the last -LSB- in read - ing my own collection of books -RSB- , with the fond hope that I shall never reach them . ''

		This by way of introduction , on our part , to a brief mention of the second volume of the '' Proceedings and Papers '' of the
Bibliographical Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, beautifully printed on soft creamy papei * , wide-margined and rough-edged , bound in flexible boards with paper label -- could any exterior and material qualities be more irresistibly attractive to bibliophiles and biblio - maniacs ?

		But is there a single one of the tribe who would not consider it a hardship to be forced to read the volume ?

		Someone may answer that it is not meant to be read -- only consulted .

		True enough .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 and well that it is so .

		The curious consultant will find , among other out-of-the-way hits of information , the intelligence that if he is interested in the study of heredity in pigeons the Concilium Bibliograph - icum can furnish him with a list of all extant works on the subject .

		On the whole , these Proceedings and Papers are wonderfully scholarly , and are packed with information which it would be difficult , if not impossible , to find elsewhere .

		• • • An English conception of American culture , not much nearer the truth than many another trans - atlantic notion concerning things on this side the water , arrests the eye in the dignified pages of that old and authoritative literary review , '' The Athe - naeum . ''

		Our great reading public , it seems , is nearly a century behind that of
England	LOCATION	in its tastes , but is making strenuous endeavors to catch up . ''

		Naturally , '' says our critic , speaking of these readers , `` they have as yet little delicacy or depth of taste : they are out in search of general informa - tion , and what they really appreciate in literature is its instructive qualities .

		A literary critic who intends to inform the minds of a public of this order must naturally refrain from writing for amateurs of the finer delicacies of literature , in the manner of
Hazlitt	PERSON	, Lamb ,
Arnold	LOCATION	, or Pater . ''

		And who is the literary critic that is conceived of as refraining from the finer delicacies in order to suit the vulgar taste ?

		It is none other than the author of the '' Shelburne Essays '' and the literary editor of '' The Nation , '' -- Mr.
Paul Elmer	PERSON	More !

		Mr.
More	PERSON	, it is true , has some of the good old-fashioned tastes and something of the weighty and erudite manner of the early Edin - burgh reviewers , as his English critic affirms , in a two-column notice of the
Shelburne	LOCATION	volumes .

		But there are worse crimes than industry and learning in literary criticism , and one of them is harshness and lack of sympathy .

		The article -LRB- the '' hurticle '' one might well call it , borrowing
Thackeray	PERSON	's term -RRB- winds up with a good sharp sting in its tail : '' They -LSB- those for whom Mr.
More	PERSON	is supposed to write -RSB- are ineffectual dilettanti in the making , and Mr.
More	PERSON	, instead of purifying , enlarging , and training their taste , reflects it . ''

		If there are certain traits of readers that date back to ''
1820	DATE	or thereabouts , '' there is also a certain manner of book-reviewing that can claim a like antiquity .

		• • • The linguistic conquests of English , as a medium of communication , are great and ever - increasing .

		Dr.
Alexander Wilder	PERSON	, writing in advo - cacy -LRB- whether well or ill advised -RRB- of simplified spelling , notes the spread of our language all over the globe as an unprecedented development in the history of human speech .

		`` By colonization and commercial intercourse , '' he says , '' the English lan - guage already holds the lead in the civilized world .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	,
South Africa	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
New Zealand	LOCATION	are all peopled by English-speaking population .

		It is not necessary to enumerate other regions where also it has a firm foothold .

		Enough that where it has penetrated , there it has come to stay .

		It is the language most used in commercial transactions , and by the electric telegraph .

		With all its faults thick upon it , these agencies are operated to best purpose with its use . ''

		One cogent reason , ordinarily overlooked , why En - glish has become all but a world-language , at the expense of French , German , and other candidates for this proud preeminence , may be found in the British disinclination to chatter in alien tongues .

		The Russian , the Dutchman , the German , and even the haughty Spaniard , have a more polyglot pliability than the sturdy Briton , who persists in acting on the assumption that good Anglo-Saxon , repeated with emphasis if necessary , as one reiterates in louder tones to a deaf person or an inattentive child , will make his meaning clear to any foreigner he may encounter in his continental tours .

		Thus , since
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	will not come to the foreigner in the latter 's tongue , the foreigner is forced to go to
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	in the language that has now become more or less famUiar to so large a fraction of mankind .

		The fisherman 's solace at sea , when there is '' nothing doing '' in his field of business , is a good story-book ; or , at any rate , thus we are assured by Mr.
Charles F. Karnopp	PERSON	, who is soon to be stationed at
St. John 's	ORGANIZATION	,
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, in charge of the
Seamen 's Institute	ORGANIZATION	which it is proposed to build in connection with Dr.
Grenf	PERSON	ell 's work in
Labrador	LOCATION	.

		It appears that eighty-five thousand fishermen and other toilers of the sea enter the port of St.
John	PERSON	's every year , and they have a consuming appetite for reading matter of a light and entertaining sort , such as old magazines with plenty of good stories .

		Mr.
Karnopp	PERSON	writes : '' Especially during the months of
September , October	DATE	and
November	DATE	, hundreds and thousands of men are in the harbor where these magazines might be distributed with a great deal of appreciation on the part of the fishermen ; and again during the months of
April	DATE	and
May	DATE	, when they prepare for the Labrador fisheries , we could use thousands of magazines ; for oftentimes these vessels go down the coast with practically no reading matter at all . ''

		Evidently here is work cut out for the marine department of the travelling library indus - try ; but individual readers of this appeal will do a charitable deed by sending any suitable magazines they may be willing to part with to Mr.
Karnopp	PERSON	at the rooms of the
Grenf ell Association	ORGANIZATION	, 156 Fifth Avenue ,
New York	LOCATION	... Organization for the spread of culture is often necessary and commendable .

		Public-school education requires machinery and method .

		No creed , however spiritual , secures converts without conde - scending somewhat to the necessity of material instruments .

		Public libraries do not grow and flourish with the spontaneity of dandelions in

California	LOCATION	, energetic and progressive , even if not always most wisely directing her energies , is debat - 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ing the establishment of county libraries to bring into harmonious cooperation all the public libraries of each county , while the county libraries themselves will look to the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	as their head , and
the State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	will find himself in a position of greatly increased importance and dignity and useful - ness in the general administration and supervision of the library interests of the entire commonwealth .

		By such completeness of organization , with the hoped - for aid of a special parcels post for rural book - delivery , it is expected that public-library privileges , in some form or other , will be extended to the remot - est dweller on ranch or fruit-farm .

		The beauty of this scheme is very appealing .

		Other States --
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	-- have already accom - plished something in the way of county action of this sort ; but nowhere has so elaborate a plan been so seriously and hopefully discussed as in
California	LOCATION	.

		Legislative action of an enlightened kind is now awaited .

		Of cotirse there are manifest dangers in any such centralized system of library control as that proposed ; but with a state librarian of talent , if not genius , for the task before him , what beneficial results may we not expect to witness ?

		• • • The born story-teller -LRB- for such there are , as well as born poets -RRB- will smile at the notion of teach - ing the art of writing novels .

		In a late number of '' The University Monthly , '' of
Toronto University	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	discusses the question , partly in reply to a newspaper assertion that '' there are in more than one of the universities of the
United States	LOCATION	classes for the teaching of writing novels and stories . ''

		He does not call to mind any colleges or other schools of higher education , except the omnis - cient and -LRB- if we may coin the word -RRB- omni-didactic correspondence schools , that offer novel-writing as a part of the curriculum .

		Some of our larger uni - versities do , indeed , give courses in the systematic study of fiction as a department of literature , and thus may effect something toward strengthening in a few of their students a previously existing bent toward novel-writing ; but to attempt to teach romance would be much like trying to teach the wind which way to blow .

		Mr.
Hawkins	PERSON	well says that '' the idea of novel writing being turned into a recognized occupation or profession , such as law or engineering , is , to speak frankly , almost appalling '' ; and that '' he would be a cruel parent who deliber - ately destined a plodding youth to live by the exer - cise of a recalcitrant imagination , and his cruelty would not be confined to his offspring ; it might reach the public . ''

		... A PURVEYOR OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE is a public benefactor .

		How far the public library should spend its energies in the purveying of useful knowledge , in the form of lecture courses , special exhibitions , special bulletins , and so on , is more or less vehe - mently debated by tax-payers and others .

		Yet there are far worse uses to which municipal funds have been known to be put than the slaking of the thirst for knowledge .

		The
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- City Li - brary is publishing a series of instructive notes on local trees that will greatly aid readers in the per - plexing task of naming correctly the many kinds of trees met with in their walks -- more perplexing in this leafless season of the year than at other times . ''

		Descriptions of , or specimens from , such trees , '' we read in the current '' Bulletin '' of the library , '' were so frequently brought to the museum -LSB- which is closely allied with the library -RSB- by persons wishing to know more about them , and so much interest was shown , that , in the Bulletin for
December , 1906	DATE	, was begfun a series of brief notes descriptive of some of the more noticeable species . ''

		Only one subsequent issue has failed to contain these notes , and back numbers are furnished on request , as far as the supply permits .

		The
February	DATE	issue devotes nearly three pages to five varieties of the birch .

		It also gives a list of thirty-two winter birds that are now '' exhibited by themselves '' in and about the city .

		• • • The pride of bureaucracy , or a consuming fondness for red tape , appears to have taken posses - sion of the British Museum authorities .

		The reading - room , as many of us have learned with interest from recent
London	LOCATION	despatches and letters , has undergone thorough repairs and refurbishings ; and now , it seems , the readers are to be no less thoroughly over - hauled .

		A late number of '' The Athenaeum '' con - tains an indignant letter from an '' editor and author '' who for thirty years has enjoyed the freedom of the reading-room , and is now , for the first time in almost a generation , unceremoniously halted at the door and asked to produce the ticket which he obtained so long ago that it is now quite worn to nothingness and thin air .

		Of course he is as well known to all the attend - ants as they are to one another ; but nevertheless he must show his passport .

		He has written to the superintendent , sarcastically recommending that if tickets are to be shown at the door during the holder 's lifetime , they be made mre perenniiis -- though he did not express himself in these Horatian terms .

		To this the high official has coldly and briefly replied that if his correspondent wishes to obtain a new card of admission he must apply in person and bring with him the letter communicating this ultimatum .

		They do these things differently , if not in
France	LOCATION	, at any rate in
America	LOCATION	.

		At several meetings of the

		THE DIAL 138 the desired end , has petitioned the
Country Life Commission	ORGANIZATION	to include in its report a recommenda - tion of the proposed postal service for the following reasons : '' Under existing conditions a wide dis - tribution of books for home study in rural commu - nities is made prohibitive through the existing high rates of postage , many borrowers , who would pur - sue courses of study , being unable to do so through postal exactions .

		Through the establishment of a parcels post the educational value of public libraries and travelling libraries will be greatly increased , as it will enable librarians to send individual volumes to patrons on rural routes at less than half the present cost , thus encouraging home study . ''

		The
Commis	PERSON	- sion is favorably inclined , and all persons interested in the proposed measure are asked to use their influ - ence toward its adoption .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Your reviewer of my recently-published book , '' The Story of a
Border City	LOCATION	during the Civil War , '' declared that while I am not bitter , I am so extremely partisan that it is doubtful if I even knew that there was another side than that of the unionists .

		In writing the book it was my cherished purpose to be non-partisan ; to relate fairly and truthfully just what took place in
St. Louis	LOCATION	during the period of the war .

		And no one , not even your reviewer , has shown that I have distorted any of the facts of that memorable struggle .

		Most of the reviewers of other journals have • represented my book as being quite free from partisan - ship .

		Whether it is or not must be left to the judgment of those who may read it .

		But as to my ignorance of the other side , permit me to say that I have long been quite familiar with the political parties and political opinions of leading men both North and South , and with the different construc - tions of the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	.

		And if I had not been , touching elbows as I did with the secessionists of
St. Louis	LOCATION	during the entire period of the war , and hear - ing over and over again their views from their own lips , I must have been exceedingly didl if I failed to appre - hend their position .

		I not only knew their side but I have truthfully stated it in my book , especially in the chapter on '' The Boomerang Convention . ''

		Your reviewer also states that I have represented the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	women as coarse .

		But I have nowhere said that in my hook ; that is his generalization , not mine .

		In fact , the women of
St. Louis	LOCATION	during the war were not divided into Northerners and Southerners , but into unionists and secessionists .

		A large number of South - em women were among the staunchest unionists .

		But I have not characterized the secession women as coarse .

		Many of them , especially at the beginning of the war , were intensely bitter , and at times some of them , not all , gave vehement expression to their feelings in words and acts that were far from ladylike , not because they were essentially coarse , but because they were in the excitement of the moment unbalanced , and in a tem - porary frenzy .

		In their calmer moments they must have deprecated what they had said and done .

		Tour reviewer also says that I have represented the unionists as persecuted by the secessionists .

		This is manifestly a mistake .

		No such thought ever entered my head .

		To be sure , in
1861	DATE	, some secessionists shot down some unionists in the streets , and threatened the lives of others ; but we never regarded such conduct , however dastardly and condenmable , as persecution .

		We were engaged in a desperate fight , which threatened the existence of our republic , and we were not so ignoble as to regard any suffering on behalf of our country as persecution .

		It seemed to me to be only fair that , in a friendly spirit , I should be permitted to take exception to these declarations of your reviewer , -- declarations so foreign to my thought and , in my judgment , so misleading in reference to the character and spirit of my book .

		Some Celebrated Characters of
THE liAST Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Expectation of good reading in a book of reminiscences by the well-knowTi and variedly - experienced magazine editor and art and dra - matic critic , Mr.
J. Comyns Carr	PERSON	, is not disappointed . ''

		Some Eminent Victorians , '' written at the close of the author 's sixth decade , is not only pleasantly and intimately reminiscent of many celebrated men of the
last century	DATE	, but also receives something of added weight and value from the interspersed expressions of a ripe judgment on divers questions of art , literature , and the drama .

		A natural attachment to the approved standards of an earlier day declares itself in these carefully considered opinions .

		Science , Mr.
Carr	PERSON	admits , has made unexampled progress in the last few decades ; but that art in its later developments is necessarily more excellent , he denies .

		He also questions the exclusive right of the specialist to pass judgment on matters of painting and sculpture , poetry and drama and music .

		Wide-ranging in his interests and activities , and catholic in his tastes , he has small sympathy with passing fads and short-lived enthusiasms .

		His literary favorites are designated in his opening chapter , where he tells us that under the influence of Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	, to whom he went to school , he acquired an early liking for
Johnson	PERSON	that has continued unabated through life and is only equalled by his fondness for
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	.

		In terms of what might by the mali - cious be construed as a doubtful compliment , Mr.
Carr	PERSON	writes that
Boswell	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	are among the books kept within reach of his bed , and that to no other authors does he so con - stantly turn when sleep is not easy to win .

		Early in his course as journalist , he enjoyed the stim - ulating companionship of the late
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	, of whom he says : '' Our little circle on the staff of
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	was later joined by
Churton Collins	PERSON	, now the Professor of English Literature at the
University	ORGANIZATION	at
Birmingham	LOCATION	, then only a boy fresh from
Oxford	LOCATION	, but a boy whose mind was already stored with a knowledge of English literature such as I suppose few men of his generation boast .

		His prodigious memory both in prose and poetry I certainly have never encountered in another ; and through many an evening , when he dined quietly with us in our rooms in Great
Russell Street	PERSON	, did we wonder and delight to listen to him as he passed from author to author , not • Some Eminent Victorians .

		always reciting things of his own choice , but responding with equal readiness to any call that might be made upon him by others . ''

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	's successive connection with not a few of the leading
London	LOCATION	newspapers and reviews , and his editorship of '' The English Illustrated Magazine '' in its first years , made him acquainted with the chief writers and artists and actors of his time and country .

		More than one amusing anecdote is recorded of the unfail - ingly amusing
Whistler	LOCATION	, whose pride in his own unpopularity and whose zestful practice of the gentle art of making enemies are truly delightful to contemplate .

		This side of his freakish nature is thus touched upon by the observant writer : '' Combat was the delight of his life , and there was no violence of assertion he did not love to employ if he thought that by no other means could he encourage an opponent into the dangerous arena of controversy .

		As a matter of fact , I do not think he was ever quite happy unless one of these pretty little quarrels was on hand , and whenever he suspected that any particular dispute in which he was engaged showed signs of waning , he would , I thmk out of pure devilment , cast about to lay the foundations of a new quarrel . ''

		Traits and anecdotes of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, to whose friendship Mr.
Carr	PERSON	was admitted , furnish some pages of agreeable reading .

		A well-known characteristic of the poet and a suggestive observation thereon are thus recorded : '' At our last meeting he openly expressed his vexa - tion at an mifavorable article that had then recently appeared .

		He questioned me closely as to what I thought could have been the motive of the writer , who for the rest was not of such a rank that his censure need have disturbed the poet 's equanimity .

		* What harm have I ever done to him ? '

		he exclaimed , in tones that seemed to me at the time almost childlike in reproach .

		But it is , as I have come to think , a sure hall-mark of genius that its weakness is very often frankly avowed .

		It is a part of that inward candour that makes for greatness , the petty price that we have to pay for the larger and nobler revelation .

		Lesser spirits can often contrive to hide their littleness , but in the greatest it is nearly always carelessly confessed . ''

		The following comparison is worth quoting , partly because it is the fruit of a personal expe - rience that , in some diegree at least , many will find to be the direct opposite of their own : '' At the time when I first met
Tennyson	LOCATION	, I think
Robert Browning	PERSON	had won my larger admiration .

		I thought him the greater poet of the two -- I no longer think so now ; and the very quaUties which so strongly attracted me as a youth have since proved in themselves t9 be the source of my altered judgment .

		It seems like a paradox , but I believe it to be none the less true , that it is the intellectual quality in verse that first most strongly attracts the younger student of poetry .

		So at least it was in my case .

		The complexity of thought , even the obscurity of expression which marks so much of
Browning	PERSON	's work , had for me then the strongest fascination ... And although the spell he then exer -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 186 cised over my imagination still in some degree survives , I find myself now asking of poetry less and less for any ordered philosophy of life , and more and more for life itself .

		... In every art the last word is simplicity .

		There is no phase of thought or feeling rightly admis - sible into the domain of poetry that the might of genius may not force to simple utterance .

		It is this which constitutes the final triumph of all the greatest wizards of our tongue , of Shakespeare as of
Milton	LOCATION	, of Words - worth no less than of
Keats	PERSON	.

		All of them found a way to wed the subtlest music with the simplest speech , striving with ever-increasing severity for that chastened perfection of form which stands as the last and the surest test of the presence of supreme poetic genius . ''


Browning	PERSON	, therefore , he in the end found want - ing in `` that faultless music which alone can give to verse its final right of survival . ''

		Actors and their idiosyncrasies yield matter for many an interesting page in the book .

		On one occasion , when
W. E. Henley	PERSON	had delivered himself of an adverse criticism on Irving 's imper - sonation of
Macbeth	LOCATION	, the actor , after patiently biding his time , at last caught his opponent off his guard and thus insinuated his rapier in the other 's vitals : '' ' I notice , ' he said , speaking to
Henley	ORGANIZATION	in that tone of reverie which with him always concealed an immi - nent blow , * that you do not approve of my conception of
Macbeth	LOCATION	.

		Tell me now , for I should be interested to hear it , how would you play Macbeth if you were called upon to present the character on the stage ?

		What is your conception ? '

		Henley was hardly prepared for such an invitation , and as we sat in expectation of what he would have to say , it was easy to perceive that the critic 's destructive method , which at that time was uppermost in him , could not suddenly readjust itself to the task of offering any coherent appreciation of the character which
Irving	PERSON	, according to his allegation , had misinterpreted . ''

		The author 's recollections of artist friends , especially of
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Holman Hunt	PERSON	,
Millais	PERSON	,
Leighton	PERSON	, and
Frederick Walker	PERSON	, are among the pleasantest in the book .

		The history of English painting of that period is not wanting in incident , and Mr.
Carr	PERSON	, as a promi - nent art critic of the time , is well equipped to tell the story .

		Some rare and curious illustra - tions are reproduced to heighten the interest -- among them two comical drawings by
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, executed in a style to suit the supposed taste of the great British public . ''

		But even in these essays in the grotesque , '' comments his friend , '' and in the lighter and sometimes very graceful fancies which he would illustrate so easily and so rapidly for our amusement , or for the delight of our children , there was always an unfailing sense of composition and design . ''

		There was a certain inevitable beauty in the ordered arrangement of line that could not de - sert him even when , as he often delighted to do , he undertook to caricature his own style .

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	enjoys the advantage of being able to write , in a book like this latest of his , from what might be called a composite standpoint .

		Art , literature , the stage , and the realities of many phases of life itself , contend in him for supremacy of interest .

		In him , too , is to be found that union of the journalist and the litte - rateur now becoming every day more rare as our newspapers confine themselves increasingly to the sensational reporting of daily horrors and other startling events .

		His long practice as writer for such journals as the Manchester '' Guardian '' and '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' `` The Art Journal '' and `` The Portfolio , '' insures the quality of his work in the unfortu - nately over-crowded domain of autobiography and reminiscence .

		He writes with manifest ease and rapidity , and such flaws as a critic might detect in his pages are of a trivial nature .

		The clear type , appropriate illustrations throughout , and generally attractive appearance of the volume are not to be dismissed without a commendatory word .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Americax History in American POKTRY ' ^ .

		* From public and private records , letters , and other contemporaneous evidence , the student arrives at one conception of history ; from the writings of the general historians he often arrives at another ; while from the poetry of a period , inspired by public events , he can often see the emotions of a people at play , and may come to an understanding of the spirit which has produced revolutions and wars such as is to be derived from no other source .

		It is of the first import - ance , therefore , that the compiler of a poetical anthology so ambitious in scope as to cover the whole period of American history should have an accurate understanding of the different influences which have come into play in the development of the country , that his sectional preferences and sympathies should be kept in subordination so that no underlying preconcep - tion or purpose shall be permitted to control or direct his work , and that his view should be as broad as the nation .

		A certain standard of poetic excellence he must maintain , as a matter of course ; but this being satisfied , he should use his material as it comes to his hand , letting it tell its own story , -- not shaping it by inclusion or exclusion so as to exalt one influence or • Poems op

March 1	DATE	, undervalue another .

		To the extent that he yields to the temptation to do this latter , to that extent he fails in his task .

		It was the yielding to such a temptation which so largely destroyed the value of the late
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	's '' American An - thology . ''

		Stedman himself was already old and ill ; but he seems to have permitted his assist - ants to be carried away with two ideas which had a basis , partly commercial and partly sen - timental , the one idea being that as little as possible should be included which was hostile to
England	LOCATION	, and the other that there should be excluded poetry which was hostile to the South .

		At the same time , sentiment which was entirely ladylike was permitted to give a tone to the whole , not calculated to increase public respect for the intellectual vigor of American verse .

		Our poetical anthologies of less ambitious de - sign , -- such as those which relate to the Revolu - tion , the war of 1 8 1 2 , or the war for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, -- have been far more satisfactory , because there was no instinctive or intentional interference on the part of the compilers to prevent the main purpose from shaping the end .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's compilation of poems relating to American history begins with the discovery of
America	LOCATION	by the Norsemen ,
Columbus	LOCATION	, the Spaniards and their followers , carries on the story of the settlement of the Colonies , the En - glish in
Virginia	LOCATION	, the Dutch in
New York	LOCATION	, and after fifty-six pages reaches the coming of the Pilgrims to
New England	LOCATION	, and thence comes downward through the development of the coun - try , its contests with
England	LOCATION	, the Mexican war , the anti-slavery movement , the great civil strife between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	, and the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, to such recent occurrences as the
San Francisco	LOCATION	earthquake and the death of
Grover Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		The most noticeable omission -- an omission of more significance than
Stedman	PERSON	's failure to include in his Anthology any poem by that true
New England	LOCATION	poet
Hiram Rich	PERSON	, or by the
New York	LOCATION	humorist
John G. Saxe	PERSON	-- is the absence of all poetry inspired by the civilization of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		As late as
Whittier	LOCATION	's time , the
New England	LOCATION	poet could write of it that he thought it was the highest civilization he had ever seen .

		There is not a line from
Francis Daniel Pastorius	PERSON	, the author of
America	LOCATION	's first public protest against slavery ; or from
Whittier	LOCATION	's fine poem on
Pastorius	PERSON	, of which the poet him - self wrote that it was a better poem than '' Snow Bound , '' but that the public would never find it out .

		There is nothing from
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	or any other poet relating to the Revolutionary battlefields in South-eastern
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	-- an omission which assumes greater significance when it is recalled that of the nine battles in which
Washington	LOCATION	was in command of the American troops engaged , seven of them were contests for the possession of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, where also
Washington	LOCATION	spent
seven of the eight years	DATE	during which he was President .

		Of
Pastorius	PERSON	, a recent writer has said that he was not coarse like
John Smith	PERSON	, uncouth like
Peter Stuyvesant	PERSON	, or narrow like
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Learned 's recent life of him , in showing the facility with which he used the German , English , Dutch , Italian , Spanish , Latin , and Greek lan - guages , his training in the universities of
Europe	LOCATION	, and the wide range of topics which he discussed , establishes his right to be called the most learned of Americas colonists .

		His patriotic address to the posterity of the colony which he founded breathes a loftiness of spirit sadly lacking in much of the unimaginative verses which have crowded his poetry out of the present volume , and which have thus been invited to assist in the commission of an historical sin that can not be condoned .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's obvious motive in the elim - ination of
Pastorius	PERSON	has been to begin the anti- slavery movement with
Garrison	PERSON	, leading off with
Whittier	LOCATION	's tribute to
Garrison	PERSON	in
1833	DATE	.

		The compiler 's note to this poem says : '' Finally , in
December 1833	DATE	, the
American Anti-Slavery Society	ORGANIZATION	was organized at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	. ''

		His - torically , of course , this is a thoroughly unscien - tific treatment of the theme .

		Important as was
Garrison	PERSON	's work , he was not a forerunner of the anti-slavery movement .

		Following the protest framed by
Pastorius	PERSON	in
1688	DATE	, the adoption of its principles by the Quakers , and their spread through the States , the first Abolition society was organized in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1774	DATE	.

		By
1794	DATE	there were enough Abolition societies throughout the States to justify a national organ - ization , and delegates from
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Delaware	LOCATION	, and
Maryland	LOCATION	met in convention in
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia , where they met thereafter annually .

		Soon
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
Tennessee	LOCATION	sent delegates .

		Massachusetts united in the move - ment long afterwards , in
1823	DATE	, and the Under - ground Railroad was in full operation at the time when it would appear from Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's anthology that the movement had only begun .

		The development of the Abolition movement has been weU described in
William Birney	PERSON	's Life of
James G. Birney	PERSON	.

		Its beginning was most
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 adequately reflected in
Whittier	LOCATION	's poem on
Pastorius	PERSON	, the absence of which from these pages can hardly have been accidental .

		How hard Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's local predilections have required him to strain the course of history is earlier shown by his inclusion of
Longfellow	PERSON	's `` Hymn of the Moravian Nuns of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	'' in a chapter headed '' The War in the South . ''

		In good poetry , historical inaccuracy may be overlooked .

		Whether Paid Revere carried the news of the British march , or his story was but an old man 's confusion of events , or whether
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	actually waved a Union flag over the heads of
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's troops in
Frederick	LOCATION	, is perhaps not of supreme import - ance ; but it is required of the compder of so ambitious a work as the present one that his selections shall not pervert the orderly sequence of history , that the poems shall be assigned to their proper geographical locations , and that the explanatory notes shall be accurate .


George Parsons Lathrop	PERSON	's ballad , ``
Keenan	PERSON	's Charge , '' is an example of a poem in which spirit , movement , and skiU in construction go far to excuse the wdd vagaries of its statement .

		But Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's notes indorsing the romance can not be overlooked .

		He says , describing
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's flank attack upon
Hooker	PERSON	's right at ChanceUorsvdle : `` For a moment it seemed that all was lost ; then
Pleasanton	LOCATION	hurled the
Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	under Major
Keenan	PERSON	upon the Confederate flank .

		The regiment was hurled back terribly shattered , but charged again and again until nearly all the men were dead or wounded .

		The Confederate advance was checked long enough for
Pleasanton	LOCATION	to get his artillery into position . ''

		This comment of the editor contains many errors .

		It was not
Keenan	PERSON	's charge , because the regi - ment was commanded by its colonel ,
Pennock Huey ; Keenan	PERSON	was the Major , and rode with other regimental officers .

		No charge was in - tended , and
Pleasonton	LOCATION	did not order a charge .

		Nor were repeated charges made .

		The regiment in column , moving at a leisurely gait along a narrow woods road , suddenly encountered what appeared to be a few Confederate troops .

		There was no thought that these were
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's corps .

		Colonel
Huey	PERSON	ordered the trot and gallop .

		No line was formed , or coidd be formed in that narrow road .

		The
Union	ORGANIZATION	troopers rode through a part of the advancing Confederate line , and discovering their mistake rode back as best they coidd .

		Many were killed , among them Major
Keenan	PERSON	.

		General
Pleasonton	LOCATION	's name is misspelled
Pleasanton	LOCATION	.

		In the note on
Gettysburg	LOCATION	-LRB- page 488 -RRB- the name of the Commander of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army is given as General
George B. Meade	PERSON	.

		It is worth not - ing that the editor calls the Union troops '' Federals , '' and he says of Longstreet 's assault on the third day at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	that
Pickett	PERSON	and his Virginians were in the van , which is not correct .

		Pettigrew 's division crossed the
Emmilsburg	LOCATION	road in line with
Pickett	PERSON	's troops , and with the troops of Trimble advanced to the stone wall , stayed there as long as any other Confederate troops , and surrendered many fewer men than did
Pickett	PERSON	.

		Historically , it is as erroneous to attribute this assault to
Pickett	PERSON	as it is to begin the anti-slavery movement with
Garrison	PERSON	.

		D'Amici says that the Dutch abhorred that form of apotheosis which attrib - uted to the individual the virtues or vices of the masses .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	seems to be fond of it , and manifests his fondness once more in the note on page 560 , when he attributes the Recon - struction policy of the country to a ' * coterie '' in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The leader of this coterie , '' he says , '' was
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	. ''

		This statement is a reflection of a view frequently asserted by writers within the past few years , but it has its origin in the feeling of the present day , not in the facts of the time , as anyone who will take the trouble to read the news and newspaper edi - torials printed after the assassination of Lincoln may see for himseK .

		The Reconstruction policy was not the work of a coterie , but of a majority of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It reflected the attitude of the country outside of the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		Whether it was a mistaken policy or not , it was a legit - imate outcome of a fierce war , and in part it was prompted by the early attempts made in some of the
Southern States	LOCATION	to restore a modi - fied form of slavery by local laws which would have permitted the sale for certain terms of negroes convicted of minor offences .

		History can gain nothing for national unity by present - ing a false face .

		The largest tolerance concedes to North and South their radically different views , partly political , largely commercial , and accepts as a matter of course the acts springing naturally from the different positions .

		In the consideration of a collection of his - torical poems the presentation of history takes precedence over the purely poetical quality of the product .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's standard has been an adjustable one .

		The well-known poems are here .

		Some are preserved to-day merely because of their author .

		The supposed cleverness of
Lowell	LOCATION	's rhymes appealing to
New Englanders	LOCATION	not to enlist in the Mexican war seems to have evaporated .

		Of the unfamiliar poetry which the compiler has gathered with much industry , it is 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, to be said that much of it is lacking in poetic atmosphere .

		A number of diffuse ballads by
Thomas Dunn English	PERSON	are bare of poetic spirit , but these appear the work of genius when con - trasted with the contemporary verse of the colonial period . ''

		The Downfall of Piracy '' here attributed to
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, ''
New England	LOCATION	's Annoyances '' -LRB- unknown -RRB- , '' Love - well 's Fight , '' ``
Braddock	PERSON	's Fate , '' `` Brave
Wolfe	PERSON	, '' `` A New Song Called the Gaspee '' are a few examples of American verse brought to light that might well have been left buried ; while '' Ca n't , '' by
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	, is a more modern specimen of the tolerance of the editor .

		He tells the reader that the material gathered by him would fill four volumes of the size of the present one .

		If the quality was no better than these dreary outpourings of the rustic muse , and others like them , no one will regret the absence of the other three volumes .

		The conception of this volume was so excellent , so much of the formidable task has been accom - plished with patience and intelligence , and in spite of its faults the outcome is so useful , that the errors of omission and commission noted are viewed with regret .

		man who fills it .

		Thus it is one thing at one time and something very different at another time , depending on the man and on the circum - stances under which he is called upon to govern .

		Some Presidents have deliberately refrained from exercising the full power which they might legally have done , either from conscientious scruples or because they were theorists , holding to the '' literary theory '' of the Constitution and acting as if they thought
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Avenue should have been even longer than it really is , rather than practical statesmen conscious of power and fearless of responsibility .

		He esti - mates the importance of the office in its true light , when he concludes that henceforth it must be regarded as one of the greatest in the world , and that the incumbent must be one of the leading rulers of the earth , and not merely a domestic officer as was once the case .

		He must stand always , says Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, at the front of our affairs ; and the office will be as big and as influential as the man who occupies it .

		Following English analogies further , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	characterizes
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as a '' reformed and properly regulated Parliament . ''

		He dis - cusses , somewhat in the manner of his earlier work on
Congressional Government	ORGANIZATION	, the legis - lative methods of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as compared with those of the British Parliament , showing how
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has nothing to do with the making or immaking of '' governments , '' yet how it takes a leading part in the conduct of government without assuming the responsibility of putting its leaders in charge of it .

		Evidently Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	considers the English method by which the government -LRB- the ministry -RRB- -- a body of experts on the practicability and necessity of legislation -- are associated with the legislature in the work of legislation , a distinct improvement upon the American method according to which the separation of legislative and executive func - tions is strictly maintained .

		In its effort to make itself an instrument of business , to per - form its function of legislation without assist - ance or suggestion , to formulate its own biUs , digest its own measures , originate its own poli - cies , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	declares the
House of Repre	ORGANIZATION	- sentatives has in effect silenced itself -LRB- p. 109 -RRB- .

		In his estimate of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, the author shows a spirit of fairness and insight too often lack - ing in treatises on American government .

		The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, in his opinion , has been too much mis - imderstood and traduced and too little appre - ciated .

		Those who criticize this body because in some cases it represents '' rotten boroughs ' instead of population , fail to grasp the real

		THE DIAL 139 situation .

		The element of population is duly represented in the
Lower House	ORGANIZATION	; while the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	is intended to represent regions of country , or rather the political units of which the nation is composed .

		It is no argument to say that because these units are sparsely settled they should be less represented than the older and more populous regions .

		They have the same economic interest in the general policy of the `` government that the older regions have .

		Sections therefore , irrespective of population , especially in a country with such physical vari - ety as ours , and consequently possessing such widely different social , economic , and even polit - ical conditions , must be represented as weU as masses of population .

		As a body , moreover , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, in virtue of its peculiar construction , fills a place and subserves a purpose unique and indispensable .

		The discussion of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	is followed by a consideration of the Courts , which constitute the '' balance - wheel of the whole constitutional system . ''

		The distinctive functions and methods of procedure peculiar to the American judicial system are contrasted with those of
England	LOCATION	, and the merits and demerits of each are analyzed .

		In discuss - ing the efficiency of the American system , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	raises the question whether our courts are as available to the poor as to the rich , or whether , in fact , the poor are not excluded by the cost and length of judicial processes .

		Thus , he says : '' The rich man can afford the cost of litigation ; what is of more consequence , he can afford the delays of trial and appeal ; he has a margin of resources which makes it possible for him to wait the months , it may be the years , during which the process of adjudication will drag on and during which the rights he is contesting will be suspended , the interests involved tied up .

		But the poor man can afford neither the one nor the other .

		He might afford the initial expense , if he could be secure against delays ; but delays he can not abide without ruin .

		I fear that it must be admitted that our present pro- cesses of adjudication lack both simplicity and prompt - ness , that they are imnecessarily expensive , and that a rich litigant can almost always tire a poor one out and readily cheat him of his rights by simply leading him through an endless maze of appeals and technical de - lays '' -LRB- page 153 -RRB- .

		Most of us will agree with him that it is a shame and a reproach that we have not brought our courts nearer to the needs of the poor man than they are , and that the most pressing reform of our system lies in this direction .

		In two final chapters , President
Wilson	PERSON	con - siders the relation of the States to the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	and the subject of
Party Govern	ORGANIZATION	- ment .

		Apparently he does not sympathize with some of the recent tendencies toward
Centrali	PERSON	- zation .

		Of the
Federal Child-Labor	ORGANIZATION	biU which was before the last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he observes that if the power to regulate commerce between the States can be stretched to include the regulation of labor in mills and factories , it can be made to embrace every particular of the industrial organization and activities of the country .

		Doubtless it could ; and it might be better for the people , for whose welfare government is created , if it did embrace some of them .

		But as to this , there is a wide difference of opinion .

		* Under the alluring title , '' The Conquest of the
Great Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, '' Miss
Agnes Laut	PERSON	tells the dramatic story of the adventurers of
England	LOCATION	trading into
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay -- commonly known as the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	has been told before , but not in the same way .

		The histories of Dr.
George Bryce	PERSON	and Mr.
Beckles Willson	PERSON	were based upon what was thought at the time to be very full documentary material .

		Compared with the mass of original documents which Miss Laut has managed to unearth , by untiring per - severence , at
Hudson 's Bay House	ORGANIZATION	and in the
Public Records Office	ORGANIZATION	, the foundation of the earlier histories appears meagre and inadequate .

		From the tons of manuscript journals , minute books , letter books , and memorial books , in the archives of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	, as well as from the mass of hitherto unpublished mate - rial in the
British Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	bearing on the history of the Company , Miss Laut secured several thousand pages of transcripts .

		Upon these data -- the narratives of the actors themselves , told in their own words -- she has built her story of the
Great Company	ORGANIZATION	, a story which for romantic and dramatic interest will challenge comparison with that of any similar organization in the world 's history .

		The new material brought to light , and woven into the texture of Miss Laut 's narrative , embraces not only a number of docimaents of which only frag - ments were hitherto available , but also several -- such as the journals of
Peter S. Ogden	PERSON	and the invaluable letters of
Colin Robertson	PERSON	-- whose very existence had not before been suspected .

		140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, tial volumes of over eight hundred pages , opens with an account of the four voyages of
Henry Hudson	PERSON	, cuhninating in his tragic end -- sent adrift by his mutinous crew on the waters of
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	.

		A brief description of the voy - age made to the Bay by
Jens Munck	PERSON	, the
Dane	PERSON	, closes this introductory part of the work -- the story of the discovery of the gateway to the wide-flung territories of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		In succeeding chapters are imfolded the ear - liest beginnings of the Company itself , through which runs the exceedingly dramatic story of
Pierre Esprit Radisson	PERSON	, fur-trader , pathfinder , prince of adventurers , and founder of the greatest and most venerable of trading corporations .

		Miss Laut has on more than one occasion entered the lists on behalf of this much-maligned explorer , and she here brings together a mass of entirely new material bearing upon his relations toward
France	LOCATION	and
New France	LOCATION	on the one hand , and
England	LOCATION	and the great English Company on the other .

		Not the least interesting of many points made clear in this portion of the narrative is that relating to
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	's second desertion of the French for the British flag , a desertion hitherto regarded as his crowning piece of treachery .

		Radisson , after serving the Company for a time , had gone back to his native country , had returned to the
Bay	LOCATION	, captured Port Nelson from the British fur-traders , carried away to
Canada	LOCATION	a fortune in furs , -- which were promptly confiscated by Governor De La Barre , -- and was now in
Paris	LOCATION	seeking restoration of his booty .

		Suddenly he disappears from
Paris	LOCATION	, and is found in
London	LOCATION	-- once more in the service of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Did he go as a double traitor , or was there some more creditable motive for his action ?

		Here is Miss Laut 's explanation , as gathered from state documents : '' He was sent for by the
Department of the Marine	ORGANIZATION	, and told that the French had quit all open pretentions to the bay .

		He was commanded to cross to
England	LOCATION	at once and restore
Port Nelson	LOCATION	to the
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay Company . '' '

		Openly ? '

		he might have asked . ''

		Ah , that was different !

		Not openly , for an open surrender of
Port Nelson	ORGANIZATION	would forever dispose of French claims to the bay .

		All
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	now wanted was to pacify the English court and maintain that secret treaty .

		No , not openly ; but he was commanded to go to
England	LOCATION	and restore
Port Nelson	LOCATION	as if it were of his own free will .

		He had captured it without a commission .

		Let him restore it in the same way .

		But
Radisson	PERSON	had had enough of being a scapegoat for statecraft and double dealing .

		He demanded written authority for what he was to do , and the
Department of Marine	ORGANIZATION	placed this commission in his hands : '' ' In order to put an end to the Differences wh .

		exist between the two Nations of the French & English touching the Factory or Settlement made by
Mesers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Groseillers and
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	at
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, and to avoid the efusion of blood that may happen between the sd .

		two nations , for the Preservation of that place , the expedient wch .

		appeared most reasonable and advan - tageous for the English company will , that the sd .

		Messrs.
De Groseillers	PERSON	and
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	return to the sd .

		Factory or habitation furnished with the passport of the English Company , importing that they shall withdraw the French wh .

		are in garrison there with all the effects belonging to them in the space of eighteen months to be accounted from the day of their departure by reason they can not goe and come from the place in one year .

		... The said gentlemen shall restore to the English Company the Factory or Habitation by them settled in the sd .

		coimtry to be thenceforward enjoyed by the English company without molestation .

		As to the indem - nity pretended by the English for effects seized and brought to
Quebec	LOCATION	... that may be accomodated in bringing back the said inventory & restoring the same effects or their value to the English Proprietors . ' ''

		The dashing exploits of
Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville	ORGANIZATION	, from
Canada	LOCATION	, against the
Company	ORGANIZATION	's posts on the
Bay	LOCATION	, form the subject of two very interesting chapters ; and another is devoted to the last days of Radisson -- new facts gathered in
London	LOCATION	disclosing the final scenes in the life of the famous pathfinder .

		Another group of chapters tells the story of inland explorations from the Bay by men of the
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay Company ;
Henry Kellsey	PERSON	's journey to the
Saskatchewan	LOCATION	; the founding of
Henley House	ORGANIZATION	;
Anthony Hendry	PERSON	's expedition to the country of the Blackfeet ;
Samuel Hearne	PERSON	's journey to the mouth of the Coppermine river ; the founding of
Cumberland House	ORGANIZATION	; and the beginning of the long conflict between the
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay and
North West Companies	LOCATION	for the control of the vast fur country of the
West	LOCATION	.

		In subsequent chapters are described the stirring adventures and notable explorations of some of the men of the Canadian company --
David Thompson	PERSON	,
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	,
Simon Eraser	PERSON	, and
Daniel Williams Harmon	PERSON	.

		Through these narratives runs always the underlying theme of bitter and ever-increasing hostility between the two com - panies , a conflict leading by inevitable degrees to such intolerable conditions that only one way could be found out of the morass -- the union of the two companies .

		Part and parcel of this historic conflict , but holding an interest entirely its own , is the story of the coming of the col - onists -- the founding of the Red River Settle - ment .

		Here , as elsewhere , one is struck with the prevalence of Scottish names .

		The central figure in the drama of
Red River	LOCATION	was a Scotch - man -- Lord Selkirk .

		So also were the leaders of both the opposing factions , the '' H. B. men ''

		Finally , in a series of brilliant sketches , we have the story of the united companies -- the Nor ` Westers now absorbed in the older
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay Com - pany -- marching triumphantly across the conti - nent , and spreading the empire of the fur-trader north and south from the Russian dominions in
Alaska	LOCATION	to the Spanish settlements in

		A Poet 's Study or a Poet .

		* Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	's volume on
William Morris	PERSON	, just issued in the `` English Men of Letters '' series , will prove a disappointment to many readers .

		It is not an easy task , perhaps it is impossible , to cover the multifarious activ - ities of so many-sided a man within a book of one hundred and fifty pages , the scope of which is definitely limited by the plan of this useful series ; but it is a pity that the vital facts in the career of Morris should have to be so scanty , and then be so blurred in presentation as to give little satisfaction to the reader .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	is doubtless justified in his contention that the essential factor in all these activities is the poetic spirit , and that the essential man is dis - cernible '' in the poetry which was the fullest expression of his real self . ''

		At all events the author of the book has occupied himself mainly with a rather elaborate analysis of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's compositions .

		Any study of a poet 's work by one who is himself recognized as a not unworthy brother of the guild can not fail to be interesting whatever the limitations of its treatment , and it would be unfair to Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	to deny him insight or appreciation for his theme .

		At the same time it must be stated frankly that his attitude toward his subject is sometimes puzzling , and one is often in doubt rega rding the sympathy and ♦

		admiration which he affirms .

		There is no ques - tion of the writer 's preference for Tennyson -- and we have no quarrel with him over his enthu - siasm for the last great Laureate ; but we pro- test that this is not the place for the avowal of such discipleship .

		The comparison of
Tennyson	LOCATION	with
Morris	PERSON	is overdone ; it recurs on page after page , until this particular theme almost supplants the real theme of the essay , and reaches a climax in the brief concluding chapter wherein the biog - rapher of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	devotes three full pages to the gratuitous exaltation of Tennyson as '' the broad - est and fullest voice of his own century . ''

		This the most of us have long since recognized ; just now we are more interested in the achievement of the author of ''
Jason	PERSON	, '' '' The Earthly Para - dise , '' and ''
Sigurd	PERSON	the Volsung . ''

		Indeed , we woidd rather hear less of
Morris	PERSON	's debt to
Tenny	PERSON	- son and more of his indebtedness to Chaucer -- of which Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has surprisingly little to say .

		Perhaps we should be less impatient with these digressions had not the essayist expressed with much vim his own impatience with Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	for certain suggestions which he deems '' out of proportion except in a biography large enough to estimate also the exact influence upon him -LSB-
Morris	PERSON	-RSB- of
Bradshaw	PERSON	's Railway Guide . ''

		We wonder if Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's sense of proportion and of values is represented in the following bit of description .

		He is speaking of the personal appearance of
Morris	PERSON	-LRB- page 106 -RRB- : '' He was careless about his clothes ; but it has been said that he only looked really peculiar when in conven - tional attire .

		One of the most charming of his sayings is that which he made in perfect simplicity to a friend : * You see , one ca n't go about
London	LOCATION	in a top hat , it looks so devilish odd . ' ''

		Upon the technique of the poet Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has a great deal to say that is illuminating ; although we think that he strains some lines of criticism , as when he discusses the '' thin '' verses and the '' lower scale of values '' in the chapter on '' The Life and Death of
Jason	PERSON	. ''

		The error here , if there is an error , lies in the suggestion that the verses quoted are adequately representative of the poem throughout .

		Another instance of this dangerous habit of generalizing is seen in the concluding sentence of this same chapter -LRB- page 71 -RRB- : `` The cry of
Medea	LOCATION	, ` Be happy ! '

		compresses into two words quite as much passion , anguish , and love as are con - tained in whole pages of
Browning	PERSON	. ''

		We should , however , be doing Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	a grave injustice to conclude this review without quoting some less debatable passage from his book , and one which will more clearly show the really appreciative position toward his subject 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, which we are sure he would maintain .

		We quote from pages 54-55 : `` This weaving-process with his thin verse-threads
Morris	PERSON	carried out with supreme success .

		He threw away all ambition to achieve the kind of direct effects at which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and perhaps all the greater English poets aimed , and in return he gained an indefinable power of suggestion .

		In spite of the vast bulk of his work , it gives the impression of great strength in reserve , and it has something of the force which we usually associate with reticence .

		Never once do we feel that he is exerting himself or , to put it crudely , on his top-note ... Never , perhaps , has there been so successful an attempt to recapture the childlike faith of the pagan world in their immortals as ' The Life and Death of
Jason	PERSON	. '

		The gods in
Morris	PERSON	have something of their old opaque symbolical significance , which we lose altogether on the spiritual plane of
Wordsworth	PERSON	or
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		By reducing his whole world to the childlike and primitive scale of values of which we have spoken , he was able , alone among the moderns , really to ' Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea ; Or hear old
Triton	ORGANIZATION	blow his wreathed horn . ' ''


W. E. SiMONDS	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		It is an instructive paradox that t/nygiTnT '' '' ^ health , like happiness , is best found when not sought , -- is most enjoyed when least the object of concern .

		In recognition whereof , many a cult has arisen proclaiming the bliss of ignorance and the yet more exalted bliss of denial .

		But a paradox has two sides ; and the other side also has its share of recognition in the popular consciousness -- the side which holds that health is a precious thing , and in these modern days is to be maintained by large-minded public provisions and a personal wisdom that is prudent but not fretful , serious but not fanatical , careful but not worried .

		It is well that popular books on hygiene suitable for the readers that frequent public libraries should be abundant , attractive , and authoritative .

		In such a list the recent work by Dr.
C. W. Saleeby	PERSON	of Edin - burgh deserves a conspicuous place .

		It bears as its title '' Health , Strength , and Happiness , '' a worthy triumvirate capable of wisely ruling the body and the mind .

		It is , in fact , a fair survey of the essen - tials of personal hygiene , very forcibly written , under a consistent perspective .

		The best thing about man is his mind , and a § ound body is the mind 's most indispensable implement .

		Dr.
Saleeby	PERSON	's book is full of good advice , and will not add to the prevalent hypochondria .

		Neither will it inculcate indifference , or a go-as-you-please attitude .

		It may , however , disappoint many who like their advice in pill-like doses with instructions for quick taking .

		It presents both sides of debatable questions , and does not make mountains out of mole-hills .

		Here and there it errs on the side of indefiniteness , and else - where in strenuous enforcement of personally fav - ored doctrines ; but that is true of every book reflective of a marked individuality .

		A popular book on health should set forth the point of view from which health is a natural issue ; it should sur - vey the factors upon which health depends ; it should state these in terms of human interest ; it should maintain a fair perspective of the little things and the great ; and it should remember the sorts and conditions of men and the diversity of human nature and human needs .

		Dr.
Saleeby	PERSON	's book meets these conditions sufficiently well to warrant its admission to the select class of useful manuals of popular hygiene .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and he closes with some very practical and pertinent remarks on inter - national peace and the reduction of our enormous military and naval establishments .

		The bankruptcy and ruin sure to follow the development of present tendencies are convincingly presented , as is likewise the certainty of violent and destructive European revolution , precipitated by the misery of the masses , unless the increasing burden of armament is re - duced .

		Jingoism and false patriotism find no friend in him .

		`` We talk of foreign nations , '' he says , '' but in fact there are no really foreign countries .

		The interests of nations are so interwoven , we are bound together by such strong , if sometimes almost invisible , threads , that if one suffers all suffer ; if one flourishes it is good for the rest . ''

		Illustrative instances are added in proof .

		The present foolish Anglo-Teutonic tension is touched upon in a common - sense way .

		In a province more peculiarly his own , the pleasures of nature-study , the author has this to say on the much-discussed question of intelligence in animals : '' My own experiments and observations have led me to the conclusion that they have a little dose of reason , though some good naturalists still deny it . ''

		The `` peace and happiness '' so agreeably presented in these chapters are by no means the peace and happiness of idleness and cloistered medi - tation . ''

		Our clear duty is to work in the world , to remain of the world , and yet to keep ourselves as far as possible unspotted by the world -- though no doubt this is far from easy . ''

		Health is necessary , and `` most people will keep fairly well if they eat little , avoid alcohol and tobacco , take plenty of fresh air and exercise , keep the mind at work , and the conscience at rest . ''

		As in the author 's previous volumes on kindred subjects , there is here also an abundance of quotation , especially from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The familiar six lines on ministering to a mind dis - eased are in deserved favor with him , so much so that he quotes them twice , as he does also
Scott	PERSON	's well-known quatrain beginning , '' Like the dew on the mountain . ''

		A curi - ous appearance is given to the title-page of his new book by the nineteen lines -LRB- in fine print and mostly in abbreviations and initials -RRB- of titles and honors appended to the author 's name -- a flourish not exactly in harmony with our conception of his character .

		His essays are little longer than
Bacon	PERSON	's , and his whimsicalities of style have now and then an antique turn that may , however remotely , suggest the great Elizabethan .

		More modern in its suggestion , however , is the occasional yielding to the present strange fascination of the paradoxical and the irrational ; so that if
Lord Bacon	PERSON	is brought to mind on one page , Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton is sure to greet us on turning the leaf .

		The very title of the book is an absurdity , of course , and the dedicatory pages -LRB- addressed to Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	-RRB- which attempt to explain its selection and application , fairly riot in pleasant nonsense .

		The writer pretends to delight in what nature is supposed to abhor , -- a vacuum .

		It pleases his humor to say : '' I never see a gallery of pictures now but I know how the use of empty spaces makes a scheme , nor do I ever go to a play but I see how silence is half the merit of acting , and hope some day for absence and darkness as well upon the stage . ''

		Among the topics chosen for treatment as '' kindred '' to noth - ing are these : '' On Ignorance , '' '' On Advertise - ment , '' '' On a
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' On a Dog and a Man also , '' '' On Railways and Things , '' '' On a ChUd who Died , '' '' On the Departure of a Guest , '' and '' On Coming to an End . ''

		The book is written in a fine spirit of carelessness and spontaneity ; nevertheless the author need not have pushed laxity to such an extreme as in the following : '' ... As he had walked faster than me ... so now I walked faster than him . ''

		An appreciation of the biologist 's attitude toward the problems of life may be admirably acquired , though at the usual cost of close attention , by a reading of Professor
Charles Sedgwick	PERSON
Minot	LOCATION	's
Lowell	LOCATION	lectures on the problems centering about the persistent ques - tions of age , growth , and final dissolution .

		The painstaking minuteness of observation of the minutest units of the microscope seems at first sight remote from the arts of regulation of life ; but in such terms are the secrets of nature to be deciphered .

		The biological provisions for maturing become in another aspect the signs of senescence .

		We grow old because Problems of age , growth , and decay .

		we have the power to grow .

		Growth is differentia - tion ; and when this has reached its limit , the adult state is present .

		Yet in addition , the maintenance of this adult state is in turn conditioned by the rate of change to which the cells are still subject .

		The two elements in the vital unit , the nucleus and the protoplasm , in
Professor Minot	LOCATION	's view , play opposite parts : rejuvenation depending upon the increase of the nuclei , and senescence upon the increase of the protoplasm .

		The problem once formulated , itself divides , like the progressive segmentation which it uses for illustration .

		The differentiation between lower and higher structures ; the determination of the longer-lived and the shorter-lived species and individuals ; the conception of death as a biological penalty for richness of differentiation ; the limit of power as set by age-changes -LRB- the popular discussion aroused by Dr.
Osier	PERSON	in citation of TroUope 's fixed - period notion -RRB- ; the curious anomalies of rejuvenation and reproduction of parts ; the provision for the con - tinuance of life by the sequestration of cells in their young stages for transmission to the next generation , and so on , -- these are the circumstances of which we are the creatures , and in these terms must we learn to decipher the conditions of our fate so far as we are ready to profit by the biologist 's attitude .

		Professor

		The historical sketch contained in the first eight chapters is a history of the city , with the changes it underwent in the reigns of Constantine and his successors , after the Gothic invasion , under the Byzantine influence , as a Carlo - vingian city and in the Dark Age from the death of Pope Formosus in 896 to the accession of Pope

		Yov the last nine years he has spent most of his time in
Japan	LOCATION	, ostensibly collecting ethno - logical lore and objects of natural history for the British Museum , incidentally coming in contact with the Japanese people , -- fishermen , farmers , priests , doctors , children , governors , -- entering into their modes of life and thought , and learning their stories and legends .

		Some of these he has now transcribed from notes made in his diaries ; and a Japanese friend , Mr.
Mo-No	PERSON	-
Yuki	PERSON	, has elaborated the sketches accom - panying the notes into beautiful color-plates .

		There are some sixty of these , -- at least one for every story , -- and their mythical subjects and general treatment give them much the effect of reproduc - tions of old color-prints .

		They lend to the volume , which is entitled '' Ancient Tales and Folk-Lore of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the decorative touch that seems to belong by right to everything Japanese , and add appreciably to the interest and local coloring of the tales .

		These latter are of miscellaneous subject - matter , -- stories of trees , flowers , mountains , the sea , and historic places .

		We miss an introductory chapter , which should discuss the origin of the tales , their relation to western folk-lore , and their place in modern Japanese life .

		In general they may be said to have all the characteristic ingredients of the prim - itive tale .

		Ghosts walk , tree-nymphs and mermaids marry mortals , beautiful gods steal the love of hapless maidens , low-born suitors outwit tyrannical fathers , reincarnations and miracles puzzle simple folk .

		But the Japanese flavor gives novelty to the familiar combinations .

		It is cheering to learn that there has pr ^ coSr r ````

		Mr.
Frank Weitenkampf	PERSON	's manual entitled '' How to Appreciate Prints '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which gives us this assurance , is therefore a more timely volume than might at first appear .

		To its chapters on the history and technique of the various processes by which prints are produced -- etching , line engrav - ing , stipple , mezzotint , aquatint , wood engraving , lithography , etc. , upon which the most recent books are nearly twenty years old , -- he adds a chapter on the photo-mechanical processes which caused the suspension in the practice of the former methods of reproduction , and in the popular interest in prints and print collecting .

		These chapters are all sub - servient to the real purpose of the book as implied in the title ; and the appreciation of prints , with the ways in which intelligent appreciation may be cul - tivated , is kept constantly in view .

		No one can read this book without taking a more intelligent and discriminating interest in the arts which find their expression in the work of the graver .

		New England From `` The Harvard Graduates ' thought ^ Magazine '' are reprinted in book and action .

		form eleven short sketches -- obit - uary notices , and eulogistic rather than critical -- of as many distinguished sons of that university who have died within the
last fifteen years	DATE	. ''

		Sons of the Puritans : A Group of Brief Biographies '' is the collective title , and the volume is published by the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	, whose president , Dr.
Samuel A. Eliot	PERSON	, contributes an Introduction .

		The opening chapter is on the late Senator
Hoar	PERSON	, a typical Puritan of his generation , combining in a high degree those two excellent qualities , idealism and a sense of responsibility .

		Mr.
Francis C. Lowell	PERSON	is the writer , and is followed by Mr.
Henry P. Walcott	PERSON	in a short account of Dr.
Morrill Wyman	PERSON	, Mr.
Ezra R. Thayer	PERSON	on Judge
Horace Gray	PERSON	, President
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	on Professor
Charles Franklin Dunbar	PERSON	, Dr.
Charles Carroll Everett	PERSON	on
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, and , finally -LRB- we omit a few of the titles -RRB- , by Mr.
George R. Nutter	PERSON	on that young leader in business enterprise , charity organization , and the promotion of education , the late
William Henry Baldwin	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Each chapter is accompanied by a good portrait of its subject , and the volume forms a worthy memorial of the eleven men whose names adorn its pages .

		What Mr.
Cyril Maude	PERSON	did for one fZ : us teatre .

		^ i the most f amous of English play - houses , the
Haymarket Theatre	LOCATION	, Mr.
Eugene Tompkins	PERSON	has done for one of the cradles of the drama in
America	LOCATION	, in his `` History of the Boston Theatre '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled with the assistance of Mr.
Quincy Kilby	PERSON	.

		It is a work which will interest historians , connoisseurs of old prints and photographs , actors , and playgoers .

		Mr.
Tompkins	PERSON	points out that no other theatre in the world has ever sheltered so wide a range of celebrities , from tragedians and grand opera stars to negro minstrels and vaudeville performers , from statesmen and clergy - men to athletes and pugilists .

		It has been the recog - nized home of operatic representations of the highest order , of brilliant ballet spectacles , and of the most realistic melodramatic productions .

		The author draws upon his own recollections of twenty-three years as manager of the theatre of which he writes , as well
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAl ^ 145 as memories of many talks with his father , who was connected with the
Boston Theatre	ORGANIZATION	before him and from whom he inherited a taste for theatrical mat - ters ; and , more fortunate than most chroniclers , he had at hand the bound volumes of its programmes , as well as the statement-books showing the receipts at all performances .

		So voluminous was the data at hand that one wonders how , in the limited space , Mr.
Tompkins	PERSON	has prevented his work from becoming a mere catalogue ; yet , in a sense , he has compiled a vade mecum of the drama in
America	LOCATION	for the
last half century	DATE	.

		The book is divided into practically fifty chapters , each chapter being devoted to a yearly season .

		As a work of reference it is invaluable because , in addition to its allusions to plays and players , it has been indexed with particular care -- the index of portraits and illustrations approximating some 1400 entries .

		It is a comprehensive record of living and departed public idols ; and it is easy to perceive that the compilation of the book has been a labor of love to its author .

		Many of the illustrations are from rare photographs , obtained through patient research , and now reproduced for the first time .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Early English Romances in Verse , '' translated into modern prose by Miss
Edith Rickert	PERSON	, gives us a collec - tion of eight famous love-stories , including ''
Floris	PERSON	and Blanchefleur , '' `` Sir Orfeo , '' '' The Earl of
Toulouse	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Squire of Low Degree . ''

		The book is included in the '' Mediaeval Library , '' as is also the companion volume of romances of friendship , which gives us Miss
Rickert	PERSON	's versions of ''
Amis	PERSON	and Amiloun , '' '' The Tale of Gamelyn , '' and four others of like character .

		Messrs.
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of these quaint volumes .

		The '' Musician 's Library '' of the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		is now notably enriched by two volumes of music by the greatest of Norwegian composers .

		The '' Larger Piano Compositions of Edvard Grieg '' is edited by Mrs.
Bertha Feiring Tapper	PERSON	, and '' Fifty Songs by
Edvard Grieg	ORGANIZATION	'' is edited by Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	.

		The former volume includes a group of four '' Humoresques , '' three `` Sketches of Norwegian Life , '' the suite '' From
Holberg	PERSON	's Time , '' the sonata in E minor , the ballade in G minor , and the concerto in A minor .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's volume illustrates the entire range of
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	's lyrical composition , the dates of the songs running from
1863	DATE	to
1900	DATE	.

		The introductory matter in both these volumes is judicious and interesting .

		The late
Amos G. Warner	PERSON	's excellent treatise on `` American Charities '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is without question the classic work on the subject , although some phases of the field of charity have been treated more recently by other writers .

		This book has great vitality , and its usefulness has been prolonged by the admirable editorial service of Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	, who has brought the statistics and other materials up to date in a most careful manner .

		The biography by Professor
G. E. Howard	PERSON	is a welcome feature of this new edition .

		The contents of the original volimie are too familiar to require a survey at this time .

		The bibliography is a valuable aid in the further study of the problem .

		The book can be recommended to stu - dents as one of highest value and importance .

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		four years ago , and had a wide success .

		Volume IV .

		of the '' Storia do Mogor , '' by the
Venetian Niccolas Manucci	PERSON	, as translated for the '' Indian Text Series '' by Mr.
William Irvine	PERSON	, is now imported by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		This volume completes the work , which is a history of
Mogul India	ORGANIZATION	during the
last half of the seventeenth century	DATE	.


Herr C. Hulsen	PERSON	's handbook of '' The Roman Forum , '' translated by Mr.
Jesse Benedict Carter	PERSON	, is now pub - lished in a second edition by
Messrs. G. E. Stechert & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an indispensable book for the tourist in

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a revised edition , with an introduction by Mr.
Cyrus Elder	PERSON	, of
Spurzheim	ORGANIZATION	's `` Phrenology , '' first given to the American pubhc seventy-five years ago .

		The widow of the late

		We understand that 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Dr. NicoU has been engaged upon this task for many years .

		His main purpose has been to estimate the value and influence of the writers and thinkers who have done most to shape the direction of English thought during the period treated .

		The edition of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's novels published by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the ''
St. Martin 's Illustrated Library of Standard Authors	ORGANIZATION	'' is now completed by the addition of ''
Emma	PERSON	, '' ''
Mansfield Park	PERSON	, '' '' Northanger Abbey , '' and '' Persuasion , '' -- six volumes , making ten altogether .

		Many charming illustrations in color make this a very desirable edition .

		The first of a projected series of encyclopaedias for the young , prepared by Professor
Edwin J. Houston	PERSON	, will be published this year by the
American Baptist Publication Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The series will treat of the various substances and phenomena connected with such branches of natural science as Physical Geography ,

Electricity	ORGANIZATION	,
Geology	ORGANIZATION	, and
Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	.


Early this month	DATE

		The volume , a collection of picturesque stories of
Paris	LOCATION	, by
Helen Mackay	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Archibald K. Mackay	PERSON	-RRB- , will copy precisely the French scheme of bookmaking in type and make-up , and the binding will be of paper in place of the customary boards and cloth .


William Mathews	PERSON	, author and educator , died on Feb - ruary 14 at his home in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in his ninety-first year .

		Among his best-known books are '' Getting On in the World , '' '' The Great Conversers , '' '' Words , their Use and Abuse , '' '' Hours with Men and Books , '' '' Mon - day Chats , '' '' Oratory and Orators , '' '' Literary Style , '' '' Men , Places , and Things , '' '' Wit and Humor , '' and ''
Nugse Litterarise	PERSON	. ''

		`` The Tempest '' and `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' both edited by Dr.
F. J. Furnivall	PERSON	, are recent additions to the '' Old - Spelling Shakespeare , '' pubhshed by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the same source we have `` An Evening with Shakespeare , '' by Mr.
T. Maskell Hardy	PERSON	, being a book of directions for a Shake - speare entertainment of readings , tableaux , and songs set to old-time music .

		Another book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	which may be expected during the year is Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's essay , ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Adequacy to the Coming Century . ''

		Mr.
Watts-Dimton	PERSON	seems to have quite a number of works approaching completion , among them `` Rem - iniscences of
D. G. Rossetti	PERSON	and
William Morris	PERSON	at
Kelmscott	LOCATION	, '' a critical account of the romantic move - ment , to be entitled '' The Renascence of Wonder , '' and a new novel .

		Among the foremost advocates of universal peace is the author of `` Ground Arms ! ''

		the
Baroness von Suttner	PERSON	, who , at the age of sixty-five , has just written an account of her life , which has been published by the well-known '' Deutsche Verlaganstalt '' of
Stuttgart	LOCATION	and
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Ginn & Company	ORGANIZATION	have secured the rights to publish the ''
Memorien von Bertha von Suttner	PERSON	'' in all English-speaking countries , and will shortly bring out an English edition .

		Mr.
John Foster	PERSON	's `` A Shakespeare Word-Book , '' published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is not a concordance , but a dictionary , with textual examples of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's archaic forms and words of varied usage .

		Even with this limitation , the work extends to upwards of seven hundred double-columned pages .

		It is particularly valuable for reference in the case of words which are in common use to-day , but which had in the sixteenth century a signification materially different from that which we now give them .

		Such words are the real pitfalls of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, rather than those which we at once see to be old and strange . ''

		Recollections of Seventy Years , '' by Mr.
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	of
Concord	LOCATION	, is announced for publication this month .

		As editor of the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican , '' the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Commonwealth , '' and the '' Journal of Social Science , '' as the last of the founders of the famous
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, and as the close friend of such men as
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Alcott	PERSON	, and
John Brown	PERSON	, Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	occupies a xmique position .

		The work is divided into two volumes , one devoted to his political and the other to his literary life .

		A treatise on '' Ethics , '' the work of Professors
John Dewey	PERSON	and
James H. Tufts	PERSON	, has been added to the ''
American Science Series '' of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its fundamental aim is '' to awaken a vital conviction of the genuine reality of moral problems and the value of reflective thought in dealing with them . ''

		Approaching their subject by the historical pathway , the authors pro- ceed to analyze the leading conceptions of ethical theory , and then to apply them to a variety of pohtical and econo - mic problems at present largely under discussion .

		The
Bibliophile Society	ORGANIZATION	, organized in
Boston	LOCATION	nine years ago for the purpose , among other ends , of pub - lishing artistic books and noteworthy manuscripts , will soon issue
Thoreau	PERSON	's '' Walden '' as
Thoreau	PERSON	wrote it , unabridged and unchanged .

		The ''
Walden	PERSON	'' now known to the reading public lacks , according to Mr.
Henry H. Harper	PERSON	, the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's president , some twelve thousand words that were cut out by
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's publish - ers from the author 's manuscript , which , after devious wanderings , has fortimately come into the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's possession .

		Two new books by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	are a welcome feature of
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's
Spring	LOCATION	announce - ment list .

		The first of these , '' The Romantic Movement in English Poetry , '' is an even more ambitious piece of work than its title suggests , for instead of an essay or a narrative , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	gives separate and distinct appre - ciations of the personality and poetry of no less than eighty-six romantic writers born in the
last eighty years of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		The other volume is a new edition , practically re-written , of the well-known `` Plays , Acting , and Music . ''


Russell Sturgis	PERSON	, well-known as an architect , art critic , and writer on architectural subjects , died at his home in
New York City	LOCATION	, on
February 11	DATE	.

		Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	was bom in
1836	DATE	.

		Of chief interest among his published writings are the following : `` European Architecture , '' `` How to Judge Architecture , '' '' The Appreciation of Sculpture , '' '' The Appreciation of Pictures , '' and '' The Interdepend - ence of the Arts of Design . ''

		At the time of his death one volume of his principal work , a '' History of Archi - tecture , '' had been issued , another was in the proofs , and the third in manuscript .

		The copyright office of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	reports for the last calendar year 118,386 entries , of which 30,954 were books , 23,022 periodicals -LRB- separate numbers -RRB- , and the remainder musical and dramatic compositions , maps , engravings , chromes , photographs , prints of various kinds , and objects of art .

		The largest number of entries in one day was 3,532 , and the smallest 177 .

		The total copyright fees amounted to
$ 82,045.25	MONEY	,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 while the salaries paid were
$ 76,475.77	MONEY	, and the dis - bursements for stationery and supplies ,
$ 1,142.30	MONEY	.

		Figures given for the last eleven years show the office to be handsomely self-supporting .

		The
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	is engaged in the publication of a '' Centenary Edition '' of the writings of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	.

		Three of the volumes are now at hand : '' Sermons of Religion , '' edited by Mr.
Samuel A. Eliot	PERSON	; '' The Transient and Permanent in Christianity , '' edited by Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	; and '' Historic Americans , '' a group of six lectures devoted to
Franklin	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
John Adams	PERSON	,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, and
Daniel Webster	PERSON	.

		Good reading these books are , and we are glad that their burning message is thus presented to a new generation .

		The
Spring	ORGANIZATION	announcement list of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, just issued , is an imposing and interesting list of books containing no less than 100 titles .

		Of this number , 34 are classified as Educational , and 7 as Scientific or Medical , the remainder of the list being distributed as follows : Fiction , 7 titles ; General Literature , Poetry , and Drama , 6 ; Art , Archaeology , and Music , 5 ; Books of Travel and Description , 3 ; History , 6 ; Biography , 7 ; Politics , Economics , and Sociology , 9 ; Religion and Philosophy , 16 .

		A list covering so wide a range of topics would in itself constitute the nucleus of a good general library .

		The committee to which was assigned the decision upon the merits of the papers contesting for prizes offered by Messrs.
Hart	PERSON	,
Schaffner & Marx of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, for
1908	DATE	, has unanimously agreed upon the following award : The first prize , of
$ 1000	MONEY	, to Professor
Oscar D. Skelton	PERSON	for a paper entitled `` The Case against Socialism '' ; the second prize , of
$ 500	MONEY	, to Mrs.
Emily Fogg Meade	PERSON	for a paper entitled '' The Agricultural Resources of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Among the contribu - tions restricted to college undergraduates , the first prize of
$ 300	MONEY	was won by Mr.
A. E. Pinanski	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION
1908	DATE	, for a paper entitled '' The Street Railway of Metropolitan
Boston	LOCATION	, '' and the second prize of
$ 150	MONEY	by
William Shea	PERSON	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION
1909	DATE	, for `` The Case against Socialism . ''

		It is expected that two , and possibly more , of these essays will be published this year by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		C Do you know THE BEACON BIOGRAPHIES ?

		C If you do not , will you allow us to send you a little pamphlet designed to help you to a better acquaintance ?

		C The aim of THE BEACON BIOGRAPHIES is to furnish brief , readable , and authori - tative accounts of the lives of those Americans who have impressed their personalities most deeply on the history of their country or the character of their countrymen .

		C On account of the length of the more formal lives , often running into more than one bulky volume , many busy men and women have not the time , though they have the inclination , to acquaint themselves with American biography .

		C In the BEIACON SERIES everything that such readers would ordinarily care to know is presented by writers of special competence , possessing in full measure the best contemporary point of view ; and , though special care is taken to lay the accent on the personal side of the subject and the characteristics which made him and his work notable , each volume is very care - fully designed to take its proper place in what is intended to be , in the end , a comprehensive view of American history in the entertaining and vivid form of a just and lifelike portraiture of its chief characters .

		C Each volume is equipped with a portrait frontispiece reproduced in photogravure , a chrono - logical outline of the events of the life , and a bibliography for further reading .

		The volumes are printed in a special face of readable type and are of a size convenient for reading and for carrying in the pocket .

		C The price , which has formerly been 75 cts .

		net , per volume , is now reduced to 50 cts .

		net .

		Each volume is sold separately .

		C , The latest addition to the SERIES is ABRAHAM UNCOLN By

IDA M. TARBELL	PERSON	, the great biographer of Lincoln , says : '' Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	's book is far and away the best brief account of Lincoln that I have ever read .

		It is sufficiently comprehensive , and it is sympathetic and intelli - gent .

		He seems to me to have mastered his material very well and to have compressed an immense amount of the real feeling and flavor of Lincoln into comparatively few pages .

		I am constantly being asked for an inter - esting short life of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and this is the first time that I have come across one that I take entire satisfaction in recommending . ''

		It is the story of an old husband and wife who come to lace a divided path -- the old folks ' home for one , the poorhouse for the other .

		How the `` old ladies '' adopt Abe ; how , as the days go by , the situation develops both humor and pathos ; how at last the old couple 's poverty is changed to modest wealth , yet the '' home '' claims them -- these things are delightfully told .

		FOR THOSE WHO READ BOOKS In the style of a supplement the literary section of
The Chicago Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	will hereafter be presented on
Friday	DATE	of each week .

		From the reader 's standpoint , from the editorial standpoint , and from the book publisher 's , the advantages of the weekly supplement are not far to seek .

		To keep in touch with the new publications a weekly survey is ideal .

		To glance at reviews from day to day is loose ; from month to month is congesting .

		In a week 's per - spective one can comfortably take in literary performance ; see it steadily and see it whole .

		Besides the greater thoroughness that is possible in a special supplement there are advantages both to reader and to editor in arrangement , in proportion , and in authority .

		Its inherent nature as a supplement will render the
Friday Literary Review	ORGANIZATION	convenient and compact .

		All the criticisms , advance information about books , personal news of authors , and general literary chronicle that have been appearing in the body of the newspaper throughout the week , but notably on
Saturdays	DATE	, will now be gro and unified in the special supplement .

		A particular attention will also be possible to the notice and discussion l. the leading magazine articles , which to all intents and purposes are literature .

		And the facilities of
The Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	for the proper reproduction of half-tones will be availed of fully .

		Besides the established critical features that have distinguished the literary columns of
The Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	there will appear in the supplement several additions of importance .

		A special letter from
New York	LOCATION	will be included each week , containing exclusive literary information , and there will be a weekly
London	LOCATION	letter by a well - known author .

		In its position as the sole literary supplement issue in connection with a daily newspaper outside of
New York	LOCATION	, the
Friday Literary Review	ORGANIZATION	will lay claim to wide attention .

		It will bid to be indispensable to the general reader who wishes to keep abreast of current English and American literature .

		Because of its form it can be laid aside by the reader who is hurried at the moment he scans his newspaper ; and its aim will be to justify its retention in the case of the person who wants the books of the day reviewed comprehensively , and judiciously selected .

		To make book reviews interesting .

		This will be the first editorial aspiration .

		The slough of the advertisement seeker on one hand , and of the academic bore on the other , are always there to engulf the writers of book reviews .

		He can escape these quagmires only by possessing sincerity and authority .

		Since the practical value of one 's sin - cerity depends upon authority , and since the union of convictions and sympathies that make a good critic is rare , it is not cynical to assert that many book views are incompetent and many insincere .

		It is the editor 's ambition to maintain a standard against all mercenary and complacent considerations which will , in a manner by no means grim , secure , a genuine service to the book-reading public , and a service to good literature .

		Organized about two years ago , with pro patria per orhis concordiam for a motto , and directed by a council of some fifty men who stand high in the esteem of their feUow-countrymen , it makes the following declaration of its objects : `` To record , preserve , and disseminate the history of organized efforts for promoting international peace and relations of comity and good fellowship between nations , to print and circulate documents , and otherwise to aid individual citizens , the newspaper press , and organizations of various kinds to obtain accurate infor - mation and just views upon the subjects , and to pro- mote in all practicable ways mutual understanding and good feeling between the American people and those of other nations . ''

		This is a worthy programme , and it takes the practical form of a series of pamphlets , now numbering fifteen , which are widely circidated , and can not fail to be helpful in directing public opinion along the ways of sanity and restraint .

		These publications are modest in appearance , but weighty in matter .

		Among their authors are Mr.
Elihu Eoot	PERSON	, Mr.
David Jayne Hill	PERSON	,
Baron d'Estournelles	PERSON	de Constant , Professor
George Trumbull Ladd	PERSON	, and Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	.

		They deal with such subjects as the
Hague Conferences	ORGANIZATION	, the principles of interna - tional law , and the relations of this country with
Canada	LOCATION	,
Spanish America	LOCATION	,
Europe	LOCATION	, and the Far East .

		The latest of the issues is a paper by Mr.
J. H. DeForest	PERSON	on `` American Ignorance of Oriental Languages , '' which is our present text .

		Tout comprendre. , c'est tout par donner , runs the old saying , and the experience of the cen - turies bears witness to its truth .

		The historian knows how many international disputes , to say nothing of actual armed conflicts , hav -LRB- j been based upon misunderstandings rather than upon irreconcilable antagonisms .

		Our own great civil conflict was the result of the failure of the two sections to understand each other , and might have been averted by a little more of the oil of sweet reasonableness which
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	sought to pour upon the troubled waters .

		We now see clearly enough that its ends might have been 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, gained at a fraction of the sacrifice which the actual conflict entailed , and the victorious North is now coming to realize that the conquered South acted in the sincerity of its conviction , and was informed by its own exalted ideals of conduct .

		We no longer think it a desecration to speak of Lee and Lincoln in the same breath , and we are proud to point to both as examples of the excellence which we hope is still potential in American character .

		That war was fratricidal in the narrower sense , as were also our earlier wars with the mother country .

		If strife can so easily arise between peoples who speak the same tongue , how much greater is the danger when the bar - rier of language stands between two nations brought into rivalry by a common ambition , or set at odds by some passionate grievance .

		And when , as in the case of our relations with the peoples of the orient , that barrier is so high as to be unsurmountable by more than a few , how vitally important it becomes that the few , at least , should scale it , and bring report of what lies on the further side .

		This is the plea urged by Mr.
DeForest	PERSON	, who recalls to us the words of the Premier of the Shogunate , '' Nothing is worse than a barrier to the communication of thought , '' when confronted with the necessity of making some kind of a treaty with
Commodore Perry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Jn these days of reckless scare-mon - gering , when yellow newspapers and hot-headed politicians seem capable of any sort of inter - national indecency , the Japanese statesman 's words are driven home to us with special force .

		If to understand all is to forgive all , it is also true that in many cases perfect comprehension will make it clear that there is nothing to for - give , for the simple reason that there is no offence to be dealt with .

		Our writer gives us an instructive illustration of such a case .

		About a year ago , an American newspaper correspondent in
Hawaii	LOCATION	attended a gathering of Japanese upon one of their national holidays , and listened to the reading of an Imperial Rescript .

		He knew just enough of the language to get one sentence : '' In case of emergency give yourself courageously to the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		At once he sniffed treasons and stratagems , and cabled to his office that the Japanese in
Hawaii	LOCATION	had just received orders from the Emperor to be ready for any emergency , which of course meant that they were ordered to get ready for an attack on the
United States !	LOCATION

		As a matter of fact , tlie reading of this rescript was a bit of routine common to aU such gatherings , was nothing more than a homily upon political ethics , and had precisely the significance that a reading of
Washington	LOCATION	's Farewell would have for an American audience .

		Yet such sparks as this are sometimes fanned into flame by ignorant patriotic zealots , and be - come a serious menace to comity among nations .

		The new phase of American relations with the
Far East	LOCATION	, which began with our subjugation of the Filipinos a decade ago , and has since been accentuated by our participation in the
Boxer	PERSON	rebellion and our friction with
Japan	LOCATION	on the sub - ject of
Pacific	LOCATION	coast immigration , brings with it a responsibility which we must recognize if our oriental policies are not to be marked by blun - dering and a play at cross-purposes .

		It becomes imperative that we should so familiarize our - selves with oriental modes of thought as to reduce to a vanishing point the danger of misun - derstanding that springs from sheer ignorance .

		In other words , since thought and speech are one , we must learn the languages of the oriental peoples with whom we are sure to be brought into closer and closer contact .

		This does not mean that we should set our schoolchildren to studying Japanese and Chinese , but it does mean that we should have students of those languages in sufficient numbers to keep us in intelligent touch with our transpacific neighbors .

		Our government should always have at its service a body of skilled interpreters , and our universities should take measures to produce oriental scholars in numbers sufficient to supply the needs of the press and to shape public opin - ion in the mould of accuracy .

		What we have thus far done in this direction is pitif uUy little , and our linguistic helplessness is in striking contrast with the efficiency which the English have had the good sense to acquire for the pur - pose of dealing with their oriental difficulties .

		The number of English diplomatists and ciyil servants who know the languages of the peoples with whom they have to deal sets us an example which we would be wise to follow , and the English wealth of private oriental scholarship marks out a plain course for our institutions of the higher learning .

		Our oriental relations are but one aspect of a problem that is world-wide .

		Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	said at the
London	LOCATION
Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
last summer	DATE	: '' The main thing is that nations should get to know and understand one another . ''

		England and the
United States	LOCATION	now know one another so well that a future war between them is almost unthinkable ; our common speech and our com - mon inheritance of historical glory put that dis - aster fairly beyond the compassing of the most sinister alliance of politicians and journalists .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 But wars between peoples that do not know each other 's languages are still melancholy possibil - ities .

		Our own unfortunate war with
Spain	LOCATION	might easily have been averted by a little more of mutual sympathy and understanding .

		The platform , the press , and the pulpit , all preju - diced because uninformed , brought it upon us , and upon the noble people whose arms we might overcome , but whose honor we could not stain .

		The Franco-Prussian war was a cause of keen distress to all the clear spirits of both nations concerned , but the comity of intelligence between Germans and Frenchmen was not close enough , forty years ago , to spare them the clash .

		In our own time , it is safe to say , a far more serious grievance would be required to occasion such a conflict .

		And every year that is added to the tale of this twentieth century is making more remote the possibility of war between civilized peoples .

		Hague conferences , and international scientific organizations , and foreign travel , and ententes corcliales , and the development of humanistic studies , and the invasion of litera - ture by the cosmopolitan spirit , and many other agencies of mutual good-wiU , are steadily at work , interpenetrating the very warp and woof of the world 's civilization , making the antics of the alarmist , and the rhetoric of the advocate of huge armaments , aU the time more and more ridiculous .

		Peace , arbitration , disarmament , world-federation , and other terms of like im - port , are increasingly upon the lips of men ; they are ceasing to be merely academic phrases , and are coming into use as the watchwords of practical men , enlisted for the holy war of the future , the war upon warfare itself .

		And that war will find its most efficient private recruits in the men who learn other languages than their own , and thus come to realize that men of alien speech are , after all , their fellow-sharers in a common humanity .

		POETRY , TIME , AND EDWARD FIT ZGERA LD .

		I .

		In an idle moment , a philosopher might do worse than examine the poets in their attitude toward
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		I say , '' in an idle moment , '' for if the task were taken up in working hours , it would be bound to result in something forbiddingly German , anno - tated in that heavy-handed manner which strikes terror to humble intelligences .

		Amiel is mildly metaphysical on the subject . ''

		Twenty-five years !

		It seems to me a dream as far as I am concerned .

		How strange a thing to have lived , and to feel myself so far from a past which is yet so present to me !

		One does not know whether one is sleeping or waking .

		Time is but the space between our memories ; as soon as we cease to perceive this space , time has disappeared ... Life is the dream of a shadow . ''

		Thus
Amiel	PERSON	, in his '' Journal . ''

		We have all of us felt the tyranny of time , at least , -- that thing , or thought , which is intangible -LRB- we know it to be intangible -RRB- , and which all the same persists in getting between us and our highest satisfactions .

		The poets have ever made a little specialty of time - pieces .

		We know them -- or some of them -- well enough to do without quotation , or even so much as reading the bills by title .

		There is one line among them which all of us once memoi'ized : it is about letting the dead past bury its dead .

		That text might well be the starting-point either of the loftiest sermon or of the most shameless appeal to our proclivities for pleasure .

		Besides , in letting the dead past bury its dead , one may have the present in mind , or the future , or both .

		Ordi - narily , however , both are too much .

		Musette , in
Murger	PERSON	's '' Vie de Boheme , '' remarks : '' To - morrow 's a fatuity of the calendar ; a daily pretext that men have invented to get out of doing their business to-day .

		To-morrow may be an earthquake .

		To-day , God bless her , is terra firma . ''

		Musette wins our gratitude by using no Greek roots to elu - cidate her little philosophy of life .

		What is more , she never had the chance to read
Hazlitt	PERSON	's essay '' Of the Past and the Future '' before having her say . ''

		I conceive , '' wrote
Hazlitt	PERSON	, '' that the past is as real and substantial a part of our being , that it is as much a bona fide , undeniable consideration in the estimate of human life , as the future can possibly be ... Nay , the one is even more imaginary , a more fantastic creature of the brain than the other , and the interest we take in it more shadowy and gratuitous ; for the future , on which we lay so much stress , may never come to pass at all . ''

		And now it is high time to see whether these paragraphs have any connection with the title set at the head of our column , and what reference they may possibly bear to the name of
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, whose centenary occurs this year and month .

		II .

		First of all ,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	was one of those to whom the past -- his own past and that of the race -- always appealed as the chief poetic inspiration .

		This is one of the marks of the dreamer ; a man of stronger will is either more purely Epicurean -LRB- crowning the present moment -RRB- , or looks more boldly to the future .

		If the verses had only been better , we could readily imagine
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, in one of his delightful letters -- which were never too '' literary '' to carry something of the human , friendly quality that endeared them to
Carlyle	LOCATION	-- citing
Letitia Elizabeth Landon	PERSON	's '' Intimations of Previous Existence '' : '' Remembrance makes the poet : ' t is the past Lingering within him , with a keener sense Than is upon the thoughts of common men . ''

		178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Certainly there is evidence enough of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's feeling in these matters .

		What wonder that he came upon Omar with a sense of ownarship , as it were !

		The world was old to the one as to the other , -- '' sentient , '' as
Aldrich	PERSON	has written , `` with the dust of dead generations . ''

		It is a conceit grown familiar , the potter figure to which one of
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's Quatrains gives ultimate English form : '' For I remember stopping by the way To watch a Potter thumping ' his wet Clay : And with its all-obliterated Tongue It murmur 'd , ' Gently , Brother , gently , pray ! ' ''

		The East it is that has most deeply felt the great age of our race , and those mysterious bonds of time and birth and re-birth that tie us down to destiny .

		One may read the lesson in such a tale of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's as '' The Mountain of Skulls , '' which is far more than a '' fantasy-piece . ''

		But , apart from the conviction that the world is very old , there is the sensibility of the poet to the past which is immedi - ately his own , the past of his present existence .

		This , too , is the stuff of poetry .

		That
FitzGerald	PERSON	was not blind to it is nowise strange ; it is remark - able only that he should have felt it all so young .

		Valetudinary verse came to his pen-point when more normally he should have been phrasing with exulta - tion the joy of living . ''

		One Moment in Annihilation 's Waste , One Moment , of the Well of Life to taste -- The Stars are setting and the Caravan Stai-ts for the Dawn of Nothing -- Oh , make haste ! ''

		So sang old Omar , -- or so
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, himself in middle life -LRB- it is to-day just fifty years since the first edition of the Quatrains -RRB- , made Omar sing .

		But what of the youth who regrets the death of the year in its very spring-time ?

		It was almost as school-boy that
FitzGerald	PERSON	wrote his `` Old Beau , '' with a ring to it that is Thackerayan , --
Thackeray	PERSON	was of his circle , too .

		Perhaps it is hardly worth quoting ; certainly a line or two is enough , -- as the line wherein
FitzGerald	PERSON	's Beau looks the young ladies over and ungallantly sighs , '' You 're nothing to your mothers ! ''

		or those that sum the whole piece up : `` Out on the greybeard
Time	ORGANIZATION	,
Tom	PERSON	, He makes the best turned leg grow thinner ; He spares nor sex nor clime ,
Tom	PERSON	, Nor MS -- the old relentless sinner ! ''

		With this rather unfamiliar ballad of the '' Old Beau , '' dug out of the `` Keepsake of 1834 '' by an industrious two-volume biographer , one would like to trill the ringing stanzas of the '' Old Song '' with which the young FitzGerald '' hoaxed '' the '' Athe - naeum . ''

		It is a beautiful lyric , -- '' exquisite poe - try '' which Lamb envied its author as he envied Montgomery his '' Last Man , '' because he felt he '' could have done something like them . ''

		We wonder less at the `` Meadows in
Spring	DATE	'' -LRB- that is the alternate title -RRB- for its wistful beauty , than for its being written by the boy of twenty-two who so lightly conveyed in the stanzas his sentiment of half-tearful , half-smiling retrospection .

		Fancyj ^ a young
Menan	PERSON	- der , an Anacreon blanc-becl And fancy
FitzGerald	PERSON	's composing the '' Meadows in
Spring	DATE	'' so many years before he read and
Englished Calderon	PERSON	's lines , -- '' Well , each his way and humour ; some to lie
Like Nature	ORGANIZATION	's sickly children in her lap .

		While all the stronger brethren are at play , '' -- before he knew old Jiimf , or felt Omar 's spell , -- passing it on to us I III . ''

		In all the actions that a Man performs , some part of his Life passeth , '' wrote
Owen Felltham	PERSON	. ''

		Nay , though we do nothing .

		Time keeps its con - stant pace , and flies as fast in idleness , as in employ - ment .

		Whether we play , or labour , or sleep , or dance , or study , the
Sunne	PERSON	posteth , and the Sand runnes . ''

		FitzGerald paraphrased Felltham in the humorous verses that he named '' Chronomos '' ; buried deep in his
Suffolk	LOCATION	, the Laird of Little - Grange -LRB- for so he liked to sign himself -RRB- could not escape the Scythe-bearer , -- and turned the matter , therefore , to a pleasantry .

		Read his correspondence , and you will be surprised , not at any sameness in it , but at the steadiness of the interests and sympathies and occupations which it reflects .

		Part of all this may be explained by the want of ambition in the man 's composition .

		One can imagine him reading with approval
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's youthful confession . ''

		Do I long to be successful ? ''

		the future novelist asked himself , as student of the law . ''

		Have I ambition , like a boot-black , who aspires to be a shoe-maker ; like a driver , who would be a stud-groom ; like footmen , that aim at being masters ; your fellow with a future , who would become deputy or minister , wear a ribbon or be a town-councillor ?

		All that seems to me very dismal , and as unattractive as a four-penny dinner or a humanitarian lecture .

		But it is , after all , everybody 's mania : therefore , were it only to be singular , not necessarily from taste or breeding , or even inclination , it is good to remain in the crowd , and to leave ambition to the scum , who are forever pushing themselves , and swarm in every street .

		As for us , let us remain at home , watching the public pass from the height of our balcony , -- and if we are bored at times , well , we can spit on their heads , and continue our conversation , and watch the sunset in the west . ''

		Only ,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	would have left out one part of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's pro- gramme , we hope .

		There is nothing so rude in the letter he once wrote to
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, refer - ring to the translations which he made from time to time , '' partly as an amusement in a lonely life , '' and which were published , he said , '' to make an end of the matter . ''

		Fanny
Kemble	PERSON	said of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	that he was distinguished by the possession of rare intellectual and artistic gifts ; she left it unsaid that he never brought these gifts to their highest pitch .

		Poet , musician , painter , and scholar , she called him ; add - ing , '' If he had not shunned notoriety as studiously as most people seek it , he would have achieved a foremost place among the eminent men of his day . ''


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 Socially , the poet never had all that was his due .

		This was perhaps well , since he would never have tolerated the petting of a ''
FitzGerald Society	ORGANIZATION	'' ; to say nothing of taking pleasure in such a trumpery business , as
Browning	PERSON	seemed to .

		Putting it baldly ,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	was , besides , socially impossible .

		That was the impression of his unhappy wife -LRB- who in - sisted on making him as unhappy as she was , while that was in her power -RRB- , and it would be our impression too , if we were not sentimental over persons who are dead , and honored dead to boot .

		Poetically ,
FitzGerald	PERSON	was slighted in his own times ; that is , his '' Rubiiiydt '' was slow to win its meed of admiration .

		Popular approval came so late that there was no time for the poet to do more than lengthen the body of the '' Rub ^ iydt '' and to change the shape of the sleeves .

		But all that is handsomely atoned for now .

		He has been duly overestimated , and has had his Variorum and Definitive Edition , albeit there is little enough worth treasuring in those seven fine volumes but the '' Rub ^ iydt '' itself and the '' Meadows in
Spring	DATE	'' -LRB- vide any anthol - ogy -RRB- , and the description of the rowing-match and
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	meadows in '' Euphranor . ''

		His earlier neglect has been atoned , as has been said ; we are gone , in fine , to quite the opposite extreme .

		When were there school-girls lacking to recite , '' I sometimes think that never blows so red The Rose , as where some buried
Caesar	PERSON	bled , -- tears in their voices and holes in their handker - chiefs ?

		There are
Omar Khayyam Clubs	ORGANIZATION	, also , which plant roses from Omar 's grave on the grave in an English churchyard !

		FitzGerald was the first to deplore the exaggeration in it all , -- the exaggeration of his merits '' as Translator , '' he was careful to state , `` not as Poet , of course . ''

		And he did not fail to observe that
America	LOCATION	was the chief sinner : even to the pirating of his translation .

		IV .

		But this is not a literary estimate of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	-- not in any formal sense , that is .

		Were it that , it would be one 's duty once more to praise his rendering of Omar 's `` desperate beauty , '' not - withstanding the silly overpraise of the poet by ten thousand amateurs .

		The very manner in which he fought shy of publicity in his lifetime accentuates the circumstance that since his death he has been adulated , not merely as the man in a million who executed '' the work of a poet inspired by a poet , '' but even more , perhaps , as something of a hermit and very much of a bear , and altogether as one of the really picturesque figures in our prosaic literary history .

		The `` Omar '' has been so often gushed over that there is to-day little gratefulness in the gushing .

		Instead of writing about it , however , there always remains the poem itself to be re-read ; even though we know it by heart almost as well as we know the numerous parodies .

		One may do worse , too , than read what Professor
Norton	PERSON	wrote in the '' North American Review '' just forty years ago .

		It was the first adequate recognition that the anony - mous translator had won from the critics ; and it stands the tests for sound criticism to-day as well as in the happy hour when
Norton	PERSON	wrote it out .

		Then there is an excellent review by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	.

		Most of the rest is superfluous ; the '' Rubdiyd.t '' speaks for itself .

		And there 's an end to the matter -- and to the translator too , as translator alone .

		Happily
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	is , for us , not translator alone , nor merely the sentimental gentleman who went shares with `` Posh '' -LRB- the bibulous boat-man whom we prefer to call `` Pish '' -RRB- , nor the lazy and erratic personage who spoke to a man one day and cut him dead the next .

		It is our good fortune that he was also a great letter-writer -- one of the crispest and most pleasure-giving in all his century .

		His effects seem less studied -LRB- a great consideration in letter-writing -RRB- than
Stevenson	PERSON	's ; the personality is gentler than
Carlyle	PERSON	's ; the body of letters is larger and their range wider than Lamb 's , which he so loved .

		His letters are , then , worth everyone 's reading .

		They make a fine bed-book , or an excellent birthday gift .

		They are warranted to contain a minimum of Tennyson anecdotes .

		Also , how fully have they the smell of the soil , and the scent of the garden where their writer pottered ; and how rich they are with allusions -- literary , personal , such as only a poet and awide -LRB- but dainty -RRB- reader knows how to use !

		Every - where , too , is the reflection of that piquant person - ality which never lost itself in the correspondent 's .

		It is on the letters that we would dwell ; the bloom is on them yet .

		They form the man 's most perfect monument , preserving , as they do , the record of his rare old friendships .

		It was in his friendships that he was least the dilletante . ''

		They are more like loves , I think , '' was his own phrase for the enduring bonds with
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Cowell	PERSON	and the rest .

		And the letters bring us -RCB- fa.ck to the subject .

		They were conditioned by that life
FitzGerald	PERSON	led of the lighter literary labors .

		The poet was little over thirty when he wrote to
Bernard Barton	PERSON	, from
London	LOCATION	, that he would like to live all the days of his life in a small house just outside a pleasant English town : making himself useful in a humble way , reading his books , and playing a rubber of whist at night . ''

		Time will tell us , '' he said ; and quoted : '' Come what come may ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	and the Hour runs through the roughest day . '' ''

		I also am an
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	, '' he wrote to
Frederic Tennyson	PERSON	, not many years later . ''

		Have been to
Exeter	LOCATION	-- the coast of Devonshire -- the
Bristol	LOCATION	Channel -- and to visit a Parson in Dorsetshire .

		He wore cap and gown when I did at
Cambridge	LOCATION	-- together did we roam the fields about Grandchester , discuss all things , thought ourselves fine fellows , and that one day we should make a noise in the world .

		He is now a poor Rector in one of the most out-of - the-way villages in
England	LOCATION	-- has five children -- fats and kills his pig -- smokes his pipe -- loves his home and cares not ever to be seen or heard out of 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, it .

		I was much amused with his company ; he much pleased to see me : we had not met face to face for fifteen years -- and now both of us such very sedate unambitious people ! ''

		`` A little
Bedfordshire	LOCATION	-- a little Northamptonshire -- a little more folding of the hands -- the same fields -- the same thoughts occurring at the same turns of road -- this is all I have to tell of ; nothing at all added -- but the
summer	DATE	gone . ''

		Not with impunity , as Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has dared to say in his discriminating memoir of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, does a man shirk the primal inheritance of labor .

		We can not think
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's to have been a very happy life .

		And yet , as one reads the letters , and as one reviews the life , with its pleasures found in the making of translations -LRB- which he sent to his friends , and not to the reviews -RRB- , and in the reading of `` large still books , '' one sees what
Lowell	PERSON	meant when he wrote : '' We are so hustled about by fortune , that I found solace as I read , in think - ing that here was a man who insisted on having life to himself , and largely had it accordingly . ''

		And we could well close our chapter with the verses that
Lowell	PERSON	wrote in his Epistle to
Curtis	LOCATION	, some lines of which he might have written for this friend that lived and died in
Suffolk	LOCATION	, near the sea : '' I love too well the pleasures of retreat Safe from the crowd and cloistered from the street , The fire that whispers its domestic joy , Flickering on walls that knew me still a boy ... Calm days that loiter with snow-silent tread , Nor break my commune with the undying dead ; Truants of
Time	ORGANIZATION	, to-morrow like to-day .

		That come unhid , and claimless glide away By shelves that sun them in the indulgent past , Where Spanish castles , even , were built to last ... '' May those castles have proved an enduring refuge for the poet !

		FitzGerald , with another than
Lowell	PERSON	, could have cried out , '' Life is the dream of a shadow .

		What is it which has always come be - tween real life and me ? ''

		Like the pens6e writers , he was more anxious about truths than Truth ; more anxious , too , about satisfactions than true sat - isfaction . ''

		A prisoner in Doubting-Castle , '' is his own characterization of himself .

		The curse of the nineteenth century lay upon him -- upon him , who thought himself out of the current of his times .

		Daudet 's poet in the story of ''
Jack	PERSON	'' had the fore - head of an '' impotent Buddha '' ; one thinks of him even as one admires the fine brows of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is the same reminiscence when one looks at the pictures of Flaubert . ''

		Oh , what a lot of money I would give to be either more stupid or less intel - lectual ! ''

		cried the boy
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	in a letter to his comrade
Chevalier	PERSON	. ''

		Atheist or mystic !

		but at any rate something complete and whole , an identity ; in a word , something . ''

		We are waiting to be told what it was that doomed these men , these Flauberts and FitzGeralds , to an incompleteness that seems almost failure .

		Does the expression , '' atrophy of the will , '' help to explain the riddle ?


Warren Barton Blake	PERSON	.

		CAS UA L COM MENT .

		The function of the bookstore is pro- nounced by Professor Mlinsterberg to be not less important than that of the public library .

		In an article on `` The Disorganization of the Book-Trade , '' published in the current '' Atlantic , '' he points out some interesting though not encouraging facts , and suggests a way to revive the declining traffic in books .

		Whereas in any German city of one hun - dred thousand inhabitants the visitor is sure to find from twelve to twenty well-appointed bookstores , and at least one such store in any but the very smallest of German towns , in
America	LOCATION	even large cities are often content to make the book-trade a mere side-line in the department store or an incon - spicuous branch of the stationery shop 's business .

		European bookstores are increasing , ours are dying out ; and there is a corresponding difference between the publishing statistics of a country like
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The former nation , with its sixty million inhabitants , issued last year 28,703 new books -LRB- including , we assume , new editions , which in
Germany	LOCATION	are as a rule much more than mere reprints -RRB- , while the latter , with eighty million inhabitants , put forth only 8112 new works .

		This humiliating difference is traceable to various causes , -- our devotion to our newspapers and magazines , our neglect of the art of leisure , our addiction to the motor-car and the bridge-whist table , our lack of a proper copyright law , and our wasteful and expen - sive methods , in the publishing house no less than in the kitchen .

		The rehabilitation of the bookstore in all our cities and villages would , thinks the writer , work a revival in the book-trade , and so in the publishing industry ; and , since conditions are so forbidding to small capitalists , he suggests that the great publishing houses themselves establish retail stores in as many places as possible .

		One comment , at least , is to be made on all this .

		Professor
Mlin	PERSON	- sterberg hardly notes -- he certainly does not dwell upon -- the difference of conditions obtaining in the two countries named by reason of the greater devel - opment of the public library , with all its varied but related activities , in this country .

		The free library with its branches serves some of the ends of the bookstore , and it also contributes no little toward the support of the publisher .

		• • • A sure road to the mad-house is entered , opines Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	of the

California	LOCATION	friend well puts it , `` you do n't know whether the ` total registration ' means the live borrowers , or whether it includes -LRB- as it does in the case of a good many public libraries , and did here until this administration -RRB- all the people since dead , wounded or missing , who have ever in the last half-century or so signed the more or less inconvenient registration cards of the library in question .

		You do not know whether the gain for the year ' in registration ' is net gain , or is a con - tinuation of the obituary list -- namely , a mere list of the new registration . ''

		You do not know , he continues , what '' circulation '' means -- whether the issue of a book for home use , or , besides that , the casual opening of a volume in the library '' by any patron incidentally thus detected ' in flagrant de - light . ' ''

		And so on , in varied vocabulary and picturesque phrase .

		A uniform rule and method in the statistical section of library reports is indeed to be desired ; but elsewhere the librarian may well be allowed some of that freedom of fancy which Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	continues to enjoy -- to the refreshment of his readers .

		A prominent library tried for a while the dictionary plan for its annual report , and the scheme was not a bad one ; but for some reason it has now been abandoned .

		Only give our librarians time , however , and they will evolve the perfect library report .

		... The living reality of the dead past is some - times made very vivid by a current event of small importance in itself to the great preoccupied world .

		The recent death in his ninetieth year of the En - glish portrait-painter ,
Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, probably attracted little attention beyond his circle of acquaint - ance .

		Yet to us it is a forcible reminder that such a person as
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	once actually lived and toiled and suffered , and then went the way of all flesh .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	married in
1857	DATE	the daugh - ter of
Richard Smith	PERSON	``
Williams	PERSON	, who was reader to
Smith , Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the publishers , and who had the discernment to recognize the genius of '' Currer Bell . ''

		Some of
Miss Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's letters to Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iams are given in Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's biography of her , and the discovery of a link connecting
Currer Bell	ORGANIZATION	's correspondent with the now living and writing Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	-LRB- son of the artist -RRB- , is a pleasant thing to readers of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, the late death of whose daughter
Julia	PERSON	-LRB- a favorite of Miss
Bronte	PERSON	's and fondly mentioned in her letters -RRB- is another melancholy but vivid reminder of
Haworth	PERSON	days and
Haworth	PERSON	people .

		Charlotte Bronte herself would not have to be of patriarchal age to be alive now -- a good seven years short of a century , -- and yet , in a vague way , we are wont to associate her chronologically with
Miss Austen	PERSON	,
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	,
Fanny Burney	PERSON	, and other writers of the late eight - eenth or very early nineteenth century .

		The over - lapping of
Madame D'Arblay	ORGANIZATION	's life with
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's , and of hers with
Dickinson	PERSON	's , can not but bring Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	, and all that famous company , nearer to us than before .

		In this connection it is curious to think how very few old women , joined hand to hand , it would need to con - nect us with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		• • • The secret enthusiasms of
Edward Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	simmered silently , as was proper , in his own breast .

		He held his emotions , his longings , his aspirations , well in hand , and had ever the air of expecting nothing of fortune , in order never to be disappointed by her .

		He was not one to give host - ages to that fickle dame .

		Whether or not he feared his fate too much , he certainly conveys the impres - sion of never daring to '' put it to the touch , to gain or lose it all . ''

		So much the more interesting , therefore , are those stray indications of unsmothered enthusiasm discernible in the yellow pages of a little old commonplace book in which he made miscella - neous entries , mostly of quoted matter , between
1831	DATE	and
1840	DATE	.

		Dr.
Robertson	PERSON	NicoU and Mr.
Thomas J. Wise	PERSON	, in their '' Literary Anecdotes of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' have printed a few sample extracts from this `` long , thin book , with marbled cover , worn leather back , and time-stained pages , '' whose fortunate possessor ought some day to publish the whole .

		The original owner , who was destined to an all but solitary life , is found quoting the '' golden law '' from
Montrose	LOCATION	's '' Song to his Lady '' : '' True love begun shall never end ; Love one and love no more . ''

		In full accord with his own sentiments are the lines he quotes from
Herrick	PERSON	, beginning : '' Sweet country life , to such unknown , Whose lives are others ' , not their own . ''

		The distinctive , the characteristic , the unhackneyed , he is quick to seize upon ; the conventional , the pompous , and the artificial , he dismisses with scorn .

		This little note-book might well , without fear of unwelcome revelations , be given to '' old
Fitz	PERSON	's '' wide circle of admirers as a centennial memorial .

		The late
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	was a worker in several fields , and he distinguished himself in each of them .

		Some will remember him chiefly as an economist , others as a statistician , others again as a social reformer , still others as a religious leader , a few as an old soldier of the Civil War , where he rose to be colonel of a
New Hampshire	LOCATION	volunteer regiment , while to his later acquaintance he will be eminent as an educator -- as the head , for seven years , of
Clark College	ORGANIZATION	, and the advocate of a three - years college course that shall , by eliminating inter - collegiate athletics , accomplish all that has hitherto been done in four years of undergraduate study .

		As an author , too , mainly in the fields of political economy , practical sociology , and industrial evolu - tion and statistics , he deserves to be remembered .

		Among his best-known works are : '' The Factory System of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' `` The Relation of Political Economy to the Labor Question , '' `` The Industrial Evolution of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' '' Outlines 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, of Practical Sociology , '' and `` Battles of Labor . ''

		Cut off in his sixty-ninth year , he was hoping , when first he became conscious of decline , to live long enough to accomplish two cherished objects , -- the completion of the '' Economic History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' that he was editing for the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	, and the celebration of the tenth birthday of
Clark College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Had he entered upon educational work earlier , he could not have failed to achieve noteworthy results , despite his lack of special train - ing for that work .

		Of sound judgment , of hopeful temperament , loyal to every obligation , and endowed with a healthy moral sense as his
New England	LOCATION	birthright , he left a vacancy that can not easily be filled .

		President
Angell	PERSON	's resignation as head of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, coming so soon after President
Eliot	PERSON	's similar action at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and almost simultaneously with
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	's termination of his work at
Clark College	ORGANIZATION	, and also at the time when
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	is looking for a suc - cessor to President
Tucker	PERSON	, makes one acutely sen - sible of the transitoriness of things academical .

		The old order does indeed change pretty rapidly ; the individual president withers , though the college itself is more and more .

		President
Angell	PERSON	's thirty - eight years ' term of office , following upon other successful activities both in education and in diplo - macy , can not in brief space receive fitting appreciar tion ; but , in the words of one entitled to pass an opinion , his '' position on the day of his retirement will be one which men of far more spectacular glory could envy .

		His fame -- of whatever degree it proves -- is perfectly secure .

		The affectionate re - gard of two or three generations of citizens is his , past the possibility of decay .

		Dissenting voices are infrequent and weak ... The teaching staff , which is of all best situated for passing judgment , throws light on some unpleasant flaws .

		But the worst of these are shallow-based .

		As for the general inten - tion and effect of his work , and especially for the man himself , it is doubtful if
Michigan	LOCATION	has another whom his worst enemies can load so little with reproach . ''

		... A defence of the signed review is made by Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	in a recent issue of '' The Sphere . ''

		`` I have seen the full iniquity of the anonymous review , '' he says , `` especially when it is written by the man who is persuaded that he is a great specialist on the subject .

		In all cases of special knowledge the anonymous review is without justification .

		: .

		.

		While something may be said for the anonymous critic so far as fiction and other large areas of book-reviewing are concerned , the thing becomes an infamy where any special knowl - edge is required .

		... It -LSB- the signed review -RSB- would have the further advantage that it would make clear to the public that a half-dozen reviews are all written by the same pen .

		At present the innocent reader is apt to assume that these journals reflect six indi - vidual views , whereas they are often the opinion of one man . ''

		Times have changed since
Sidney Smith	PERSON	and
Jeffrey	PERSON	founded the ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review , '' and in these days of free thought and a free press the critic 's excuses for fighting under cover have long since disappeared .

		As for the advantages of a signature , we should be inclined to go even further than Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	.

		Is there any sort of reviewing where '' special knowledge , '' not necessarily of subject-matter , but of form , style , literary effect and finish , is not required ?

		And granting that , what sort of literary criticism really loses anything by a declaration of its authority ?

		The merely descrip - tive book-notice , too often confused in popular discussion with the critical review , may reasonably be left without signature ; it is valuable because it is impersonal .

		But in matters of taste and opinion if a man 's word is worth anything , why should he not father it ?

		... The pernicious '' manufacturing clause '' in OUR COPYRIGHT LAWS is to receive an added element of perniciousness , if the efforts of certain forces now at work prove successful .

		The bookbinders ' unions , it seems , desire the clause amended so that to secure copyright not only must a book be printed from plates manufactured in this country , as is now the requirement , but it must also be hound in this coun - try .

		Such a proposal will doubtless be defeated by its own absurdity .

		Indeed , if justice and common sense have their way , it is likely that the '' manu - facturing clause '' will be wiped out altogether in the next revision of our copyright laws .

		In such a revision there is ample room for strengthening and extending the only legitimate function of copyright legislation , i. e. , the protection of authors .

		Our '' infant '' book-manufacturing industries are still sufficiently '' protected '' by a tariff tax -LRB- levied on the American bookbuyer -RRB- of twenty-five per cent ad valorem .

		To subsidize them still further , under cover of our copyright laws , is an incongruity that should no longer be endured , -- and especially as this concession defeats in many cases the direct purposes of copyright by making it impossible for all but the most affluent of British and foreign authors to protect their work in this country .

		• • • The COST of circulating a library book , computed by dividing the total of annual salaries by the number of volumes issued , has been the topic of some recent writing and discussion .

		`` The Li - brary World , '' in its late outburst on the subject of American library extravagance , assured us that whereas in
England	LOCATION	the cost of circulation is three farthings for each book , in this land of princely salaries and lavish expenditure it is fivepence .

		Some interesting comparisons under this head are to be found in the current report of the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		It appears that in
Boston	LOCATION	it costs almost
seventeen cents	MONEY	to lend a book , in
Chicago	LOCATION	nine cents and one mill , in
New York	LOCATION	twenty-three cents and four mills , in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	eleven cents and four mills , in
Providence	LOCATION	fourteen cents ; but in
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 183 thrifty
Los Angeles	LOCATION	only
seven cents	MONEY	and five mills .

		Who will wonder that our British censor was shocked -LRB- and the least bit touched with envy -RRB- at beholding the way we spend our public library funds ?

		If private circulating libraries can lend books at
two cents	MONEY	a day each -LRB- the average loan being perhaps for six or eight days -RRB- and make money at it , why should it cost a public library more than
two cents	MONEY	a day per volume , as it seems to in some instances , to keep its books in circulation ?

		• • • The public library as a bureau of inform - ation renders important service , whether or not strictly legitimate , to the community .

		The free library of
Cardiff	ORGANIZATION	is said to stand in the very fore - front of progress in one respect : it has established a telephone inquiry department , and , if one may credit the reports coming from the head librarian , the new departure has proved a great success .

		The inquiries received cover a wide range of subjects , -- conscriptien , cooperation , steam-boilers , hedge-hogs , ladies ' fans , old-age pensions , tailoring , and many other more or less abstruse matters .

		Where the question requires time for answering properly , the questioner is rung up again , but many inquiries are immediately answerable .

		Card-holders are enabled to ascertain whether any desired book is available , and to order its reservation if it is at present out .

		As sample questions the following are given : '' Number of Protestants and Roman Catholics in
Wales	LOCATION	? '' ''

		What patents have been taken out for buffer springs ? '' ''

		Who wrote ' Make new friends , but keep the old ? ' ''

		These were all answered .

		The number of trivial and senseless questions that come in over the wire is gratifyingly small .

		• • • Of making many books , we are told on high authority , there is no end , and much study is a weariness of the flesh .

		The past year in the book world has been one of energetic production and of comparatively languid demand for the product . ''

		In my opinion , '' declares Mr.
Gerald Duckworth	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	publisher , '' there are too many authors , too many books published , and too many publishers . '' ''

		The market was flooded with mechanical fiction , '' avers another publisher , `` and the public detected the grinding of the machine . ''

		Overproduction is , happily , a fault that tends to correct itself ; super - fluous producers are crowded out , and only the fittest survive -- in the world of books as in that of shoes or pianos or any other necessities or luxuries .

		One rather encouraging sign of the season , in
London	LOCATION	at least , was the demand for a few books of worth and eminence -- like
Lord Morley	PERSON	's `` Gladstone '' in its less expensive edition and
Queen Victoria	PERSON	's '' Let - ters '' -- works which are thought to have been at any rate partly responsible for the lessened demand in other fields of literature .

		There might be a worse catastrophe than a falling-off in the desire for mechanical fiction and other machine-made books .

		Chaucer and the `` New Thought '' may at the first blush be deemed very widely separated -- sundered , in fact , by some five centuries of time .

		Nevertheless , as it isf a wholesome corrective of pride , whether spiritual or intellectual , to be re - minded every now and then of the antiquity and staleness of our fancied up-to-dateness , it may be of benefit to turn to the 982d line of '' The Romaunt of the Rose , '' where we find that the fifth of the '' fyve arowes of other gyse '' held by the '' bachelere ycleped Swete-Loking '' was named '' the
Newe	ORGANIZATION	- Thought . ''

		It is to be regretted that the poet failed to enlarge on the nature and peculiarities of this '' newe-tbought , '' but perhaps his very silence is a proof of its being too well-known to his contem - poraries to need description .

		The immediate con - text , however , if any care to look up the passage , will be found to be rather significant and instructive .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF LITERATURE IN LIBRARIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I am sure that many working librarians have , like myself , read with hearty approval the suggestion lately made in your journal , that heneflcence toward libraries might advantageously be directed toward the inside as well as the outside of the institution ; that the gift of buildings might well he supplemented by occasional gifts of books that are worthy and desirable , but would otherwise not be likely to be added to the collection .

		We already have many dignified library buildings '' which are a credit to our fair city , '' as the President of the
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	remarks on dedication day .

		But fuel and light and salaries cost a deal of money ; so do repairs and '' incidentals . ''

		The pitifully meagre residuum we may spend on books .

		First of all , we mtist buy plenty of copies of the popular novels of the day .

		They are often unobjectional and desirable , and the taxpayer is justified in his clamor for them .

		But , alas !

		too often we have no money left with which to purchase the Pennells ' '' Whistler '' or
Lowell	PERSON	's '' Gov - ernment of
England	LOCATION	'' ; while that choice edition of '' Purchas his Pilgrimes '' is simply out of the question , even though a copy may be had at a great bargain .

		The object of that splendid endowment , the '' General Education Fund , '' is '' to promote , systematize and make effective the various forms of educational beneficence . ''

		On investigation the honorable gentlemen charged with the disbursement of this fund might discover that many a monumental public library is an institiition rather ineffective in the higher realms of culture .

		This is by no means the fault of librarians .

		Our expensive library machinery is in good working order .

		Librarians are best pleased when it is working with the best of mate - rials .

		Most of us now refuse to deal with stuff that is positively shoddy .

		The popular demand is for goods of a passable quality , even if dyed in rather crude colors .

		Shall we not have an opportunity to handle occasionally the more gracious silks and satins -- the finer and rarer products of literature ?

		* Commercial greed and political schemes no longer play an important part in exploration .

		The sand wastes of the
Sahara	LOCATION	, the rock wastes of
Tibet	LOCATION	, the ice wastes around the Poles , the jungles of
Africa	LOCATION	, and the vast expanses of unexplored
South America	LOCATION	, offer very little inducement to the mercenary spirit .

		But the lure of the unknown , the appeal of terr ' a incognita ^ the call of the wild , and the search for the curi - ous , are as ever the strong determining factors that draw the venturesome to endure the perils and the hardships of the almost inconceivable places on the earth .

		If the modern explorer may draw a few new and definite geographical lines , if he may determine the elevation of an isolated mountain , and if happily he may dis - cover some new though worthless feature on the globe , he is content .

		His mite of information goes toward filling in some bare spots of geo - graphical knowledge , though it brings no re - wards to the commercially minded or adds no breadth to a king 's domain .

		Such an explorer is Prince
Luigi Amedeo	PERSON	of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	, better known to fame and newspaper advertisement as
H. R. H. the Duke	PERSON	of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	.

		As an explorer , his record includes the ascent of
Mount St. Elias	LOCATION	, the farthest north in Arctic exploration , and finally the actual discovery of the mysterious legendary moun - tains of Ptolemy -- the Mountains of the
Moon	PERSON	, in
Equatorial Africa	LOCATION	, upon the borders of
Congo	LOCATION	and
Uganda	LOCATION	.

		The account of this last expedi - tion is now given in the volume entitled ''
Ruwen	PERSON	- zori , '' the new name of the old mythical range of mountains .

		This moimtain system holds a peculiar posi - tion in geographical history .

		Ptolemy , follow - ing the persistent native traditions , located the towering snowy range somewhere in the depths of central
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Generations of succeeding geographers have contented themselves with either accepting his shadowy statement or deny - ing it .

		Stanley , in
1876	DATE	, was the first white man to be near these mountains , but owing to the fog and mist which almost perpetually hang over them , he did not see the imposing sight .

		In

		later , Lieutenant Stairs , of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's expedition , attempted to ascend one of the great peaks , but attained an altitude of only eleven thousand feet .

		In
1905	DATE	some members of the British Museimi expedition reached a height of sixteen thousand feet .

		It remained for the Duke of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	, with a carefully prepared expedition , to ascend the highest peaks , to map the configurations , to locate the watersheds which feed the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, to determine the extent and the position of the glaciers , to note the fauna and the flora , and to dispel the mystery which had so long perplexed the makers of African geography .

		A summary of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's expedition might lead the reader of this review to expect to find the book replete with interesting , even thrilling , details .

		This expectation will , however , be dis - appointed .

		Being engrossed with other affairs , His Royal Highness was prevented from writing the book , and turning over his journals to his friend
Cavaliere Fillipo de Filippi	PERSON	, he commis - sioned him to recount the affairs of the expedi - tion .

		Hence the narrative comes to us at second hand .

		Very unfortunately , too ,
Cavaliere de Filippi	PERSON	was not a member of the party , though he had on a former expedition been the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's companion .

		Had the explorer told his own story , the book would no doubt have been more lively in style and more vital in content .

		But these unavoidable defects in the narrative by no means disparage the intrinsic merit of the expedi - tion , which went forth , not for a story , but to discover and catalogue scientific data .

		And as a record of important scientific discovery , no possible fault can be found with the book .

		Setting out from
Naples	LOCATION	, on the sixteenth of
April , 1906	DATE	, the expedition began the African part of its journey at
Mombasa	LOCATION	in
British East Africa	LOCATION	, thence extended to
Port Florence	LOCATION	on
Lake Victoria	LOCATION	, and finally arrived at
Entebbe	LOCATION	, the capital of
Uganda	LOCATION	.

		Fifteen days more of , travelling through equatorial swamps and jungles brought the party to the beginning of its work , within sight of the icy peaks of
Ruwenzori	LOCATION	, looming high above the tropic jungle and shed - ding their glacial waters into the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
September	DATE	the object of the expedition had been accomplished .

		The different peaks and glaciers had been explored ; the summits of two peaks , each nearly seventeen thousand feet high , had been surmounted by the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, who planted an Italian flag on one of the peaks and an English flag on the other , and named them respectively

H. E. COBLENTZ	PERSON	.

		Chaucer axd his Times .

		* In giving us a book on so inviting a theme as ''
Chaucer	PERSON	and his
England	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	has attempted a most useful task , viz. : to fur - nish some account of Chaucer the man , with a very full description of the world in which he lived and some parts of which are reflected in his poems .

		For two reasons a good book on this subject is desirable .

		First , the measure of success attained by any literature or literary work in interpreting life or a section of it can - not be determined until the critic knows some - thing of the life presim ^ iably mirrored in the literature .

		Such a knowledge of the age of
Edward the Third	ORGANIZATION	is not easily accessible .

		With many phases of the history of the period , the historians --
Trevelyan	PERSON	,
Oman	LOCATION	, and others -- have been busy ; yet we know of no book of similar compass from which one can learn so much of the private life of fourteenth-century
England	LOCATION	as one can from Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	's .

		It is weU arranged ; it is not overloaded with general statements ; the author writes as a rule with steady concentration , and is evidently much in - terested in his subject .

		His work , therefore , has not been done perfunctorily ; his book is fresh and stimulating .

		Secondly , even for those who read Chaucer not with a critical eye but merely for the sake of knowledge or inspiration , a body of work like his can be much better understood if studied in connection with an informal running com - mentary such as is afforded by this book .

		Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	has worked , of course , in a very different field from that of Dr. Root 's '' Poetry of Chau - cer '' or of Professor
Tatlock	PERSON	's '' Development and Chronology of Chaucer 's Works . ''

		He has nothing to say of literary sources , theories of authorship , or dates ; indeed , he is not exces - • Chaucek and his
England	LOCATION	.

G. G. Coulton	PERSON	.

		trated .

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Illus - sively critical about the facts of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's life , although he rejects Mr.
Walter Rye	PERSON	's view that
Chaucer	PERSON	was a
Norfolk	LOCATION	man .

		At some points he draws freely upon his imagination -- for ex - ample in describing Chaucer 's childhood ; yet the result perhaps is plausible enough .

		Assum - ing that
Chaucer	PERSON	was a perfectly normal boy , we may suppose that he did play games of ball , bring his cock to fight in school on Shrove
Tuesday	DATE	, and indulge in football , '' leaping , dancing , shooting , wrestling , and casting the stone '' ; that he loitered along the busy Thames , studying the sailors , and went in due time to a grammar school , taking his turn under the rod of the pedagogue .

		In the utter absence of facts , this theory will answer well enough ; but we must bear in mind that it is only an a prion theory .

		In connection with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's married life , Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	has some sensible if unromantic things to say about conjugal love in the four - teenth century . ''

		However apocryphal , '' he remarks , '' may be the alleged solemn verdict of a Court of Love that husband and wife had no right to be in love with each other -LSB- why regard it as either apocryphal or solemn ? -RSB-

		, the sentence was at least recognized as hen trovato ; and nobody who has closely studied mediaeval society , either in romance or in chronicle , would suppose that Chaucer blushed to feel a hopeless passion for another , or to write openly of it while he had a vnfe of his own . ''

		By implication , then , Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	assumes that the imrequited love which had tortured Chaucer for eight years prior to
1366	DATE	-LRB- '' Blaunche the Duchesse '' 30 ff . -RRB-

		was an actual and not merely a conventional emotion .

		While this is possible , such an assumption , as Mr.
Sypherd	PERSON	has shown , is by no means a safe one .

		Nor is the '' evidence '' of unhappiness in his married life conclusive ; it would not be even if his literary allusions to wedded life were uniformly -LRB- instead of `` predominantly '' -RRB- dis - respectful , for he was under no obligation to write autobiography , and even if he did allude to actual unhappiness in his own life it may have been humorously exaggerated .

		Finally , are we warranted in taking the above lines as an allu - sion to a love experience , whether real or feigned ?

		The poet himself puts it very vaguely ; he can - not tell why he can not sleep , etc. .

		It is hard to see why a real and actual experience should be described in such vague terms .

		Did the poet mean that the passage should be understood ?

		Concerning the loss of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's position as Clerk of the Works , in
June , 1391	DATE	, after a two - year tenure of office , Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	thinks '' it is 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, difficult to resist the conviction that
Chaucer	PERSON	was by this time recognized as an unbusiness - like person , '' since at this time '' we can find nothing in the political situation to account for the dismissal . ''

		This is not impossible ; yet other alternatives suggest themselves .

		Until further evidence is forthcoming , Lounsburys remarks -LRB- `` Studies in Chaucer '' i. 85 ff . -RRB-

		must suffice .

		We mention these points , not as of great importance in themselves , but as illustrating the direction in which the book is weak .

		When the author ventures far from the beaten path of biography into the attractive by-ways of con - jecture , he is not to be taken too seriously .

		The chief value of the book lies in the fresh and lifelike pictures it affords of society in town and country .

		The streets of
London	LOCATION	, its environs , its laws , the decay of the old chivalry and the rise of an aristocracy of industry and wealth , child-marriages , the science of courtly love , the Great War and the decline of knighthood , the condition of the poor , the cost of books , the amusements of the time , the uncertainties of justice , the corruption of the clergy , -- these are among the topics vividly treated .

		The pic - tures Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	draws for us form capital backgrounds for the actions of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's poems .

		Moreover , they bring home to us how small a section of the life of his day is presented even in the whole body of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		His fundamental purpose in writing was to enter - tain ; and however much he might sympathize with the poor and oppressed , their burden finds no record and elicits no outburst of sorrow or indignation in his pages .

		For this we must go to
Langland	PERSON	-LRB- or the
Langland	LOCATION	group , if some of our latest writers carry their point -RRB- and to
Gower	PERSON	.

		Yet Chaucer 's limitations , consciously or unconsciously imposed , must not be men - tioned by way of reproach .

		Art is never super - fluous and ministers to humanity in one way as charity does in another .

		If Chaucer chose to restrict himself in his subject-matter , perhaps his work is in one sense all the more valuable for this reason : his portrayal of a small section of life is all the more complete and perfect .

		Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	's concluding remarks may well be repeated here : '' As it is , he stands the most Shakespearian figure in English literature , after

		The Campaign of
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		* Colonel
Herbert H. Sargent	PERSON	, of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	, has told the story of the brief campaign which speedily ended the war of
1898	DATE	, accompanying his account , chapter by chapter , with the comments of a military critic .

		On the practical side of military affairs , the author has seen twenty-five years of service , being now a captain of cavalry in our regular establish - ment , while in
1898	DATE	he was colonel of the
Fifth Volunteer Infantry	ORGANIZATION	, and during 1899-1901 was lieutenant-colonel of the Twenty-ninth
Volun	PERSON	- teer Infantry which served in the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	.

		On the theoretical side , he is a West Point graduate who has always kept up special studies in military history , and is the author of two volumes that have been favorably received both by military critics and readers in general , ''
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	's First Campaign '' and '' The Campaign of Marengo . ''

		The American public derived from the journalist-critics of
1898	DATE	, and still retains , cer - tain general impressions as to the management of our army during the brief war with
Spain	LOCATION	, and in particular as to the organization of the
Santiago	LOCATION	expedition and the direction of that little army in the field .

		These impressions were recorded in hasty but more permanent form in a number of books turned out for popular con - sumption immediately after the little war that for a time made us feel so big .

		More recently they have been repeated , as if they were estab - lished upon a sober historical basis , in Professor
Latane	PERSON	's volume on the decade 1897-1907 -LRB- '' Amierica as a World Power '' -RRB- in the '' Amer - ican Nation '' series .

		Now that ten years and more have passed , anyone who desires an unbi - ased verdict on the matter may be advised to consiilt Captain

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 has constituted himself a defender of the War Department as administered in
1898	DATE	, or of
General Shafter	ORGANIZATION	in
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		His is no '' official '' account of the war at all .

		But he apparently believes that in the main the War Department and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	staff corps met the situation about as well as could have been expected under all the circumstances , and that on the whole the land attack on
Santiago	LOCATION	was pretty well con - ducted , considering the conditions that had to be met .

		Doubtless many who have given these matters some study will feel that the note of criticism is not sufficiently heard in
Captain Sargent	LOCATION	's volumes ; that he has been somewhat too complaisant both with the lack of preparation and with the actual conduct of the skirmishes outside of
Santiago	LOCATION	that have been called '' battles . ''

		Conceding this to be the case , it remains true that he has come much nearer to expressing the sober verdict of history upon these events than have the writers whose aim was partisan or sensation-seeking , or who have viewed them with entire lack or disregard of perspective .

		The engagements outside of
Santiago	LOCATION	have been called '' skirmishes '' above ; they would have assumed the status of mere '' outpost af - fairs '' in any real battle , -- quite as this little
Santiago	LOCATION	campaign would , in a great war , speedily have sunk to the level of mere incident .

		The defects due to lack of preparation , the mis - takes made , the complaints of soldiers as to treatment and sickness during and after the campaign , are to be considered in this light ; and Captain
Sargent	PERSON	has the perspective of a student of military history .

		Just from the standpoint of historical perspective , however , one may offer a leading criticism ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that , con - sidering the relative unimportance -LRB- except in results -RRB- of the events treated , this history of them bulks unduly large .

		Not that the author goes too much into minutiae .

		The naval opera - tions , which really decided the war , occupy a good deal of space , even apart from their direct connection with the
Santiago	LOCATION	campaign .

		A con - siderable part of the first volume is devoted to the strategical problems as they appeared at the outset of the war ; and the '' Comments , '' which deal primarily with questions of strategy and tactics , sometimes are longer than the text of the chapters to which they are appended .

		This involves a good deal of duplication , sometimes in connection with matter that seems either ele - mentary or very obvious .

		Yet the author 's comments , like the narration itself , are written in a clear and pleasing style , and the work is an enjoyable one to read .

		The twelve sketch-maps scattered throughout are very useful , and there is an index which , as regards the proper names involved , is good .

		Volume III .

		also has a string of appendices , most of them documents regarding the Spanish troops in
Cuba	LOCATION	, obtained in the main from Spanish official sources .

		They are especially interesting as revealing the small number of Spaniards engaged in the combats at
Caney	ORGANIZATION	and
San Juan	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Sargent	PERSON	went to some trouble in this respect ; one wonders the more that he does not seem to have consulted Spanish and other foreign unofficial sources on the war , of which a good number were published in
1898	DATE	and the succeeding few years .

		He does not append a bibliography , which is certainly de - sirable in such a work ; but from his footnotes and appendices it is apparent that he has trusted almost entirely to American sources -- official reports and other writings .

		In several places he has drawn from the Spanish officers ,
Gomez Nunez	PERSON	and MiiUer y Tejeiro , translations from whose treatises were published in a government bulletin at
Washington	LOCATION	; and in Appendix F he speaks of them as '' the only accessible Spanish authorities on the subject . ''

		To be sure , most of the Spanish writings on the war in
1898	DATE	and
1899	DATE	were put out for partisan purposes , or were otherwise of a very sensational character .

		Yet even the most ephemeral of these pamphlets has some value as showing what was the state of affairs among the Spaniards ; and no final his - tory can be written from one side alone .

		More - over , there are in Spanish and French several treatises on the war , which have some value .

		Had he looked into the literature from that side .

		Captain
Sargent	PERSON	would not have placed so much stress on the mere numerical force of the Spanish army in
Cuba	LOCATION	as it appeared on paper .

		Lack of equipment and care , especially medical care , corruption in regard to pay and supplies , like - wise the climate , had all played a part in making it , effectively , a force very inferior to the veteran army he supposes to have been under
Blanco	PERSON	's orders .

		Nevertheless , the criticisms passed upon the failure to concentrate more men at
Santiago	LOCATION	, and to meet the situation with more energy and greater initiative , would hardly be modified in their essentials .

		Indeed , such criticisms would in some respects be strengthened by reference to the Spanish sources , showing the conduct of affairs in
Cuba	LOCATION	as it appeared from the inside .

March 16	DATE	,
The Newest Faust	ORGANIZATION	.

		* When it was announced that Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	was at work on the Faust theme , read - ers of Goethe wondered what the result would be , -- whether an original drama based on the old legend , or
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Faust '' adapted to the English stage .

		The book turns out to be neither .

		The joint authors -LRB- for Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has collabo - rated with Mr.
J. Comyns Carr	PERSON	-RRB- state on the title-page that their work is '' freely adapted from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic poem . ''

		The extreme freedom of the adaptation strikes the reader at first glance .

		After turning a few pages he re - calls
Faust	PERSON	's sarcastic directions to
Wagner	PERSON	for gaining the ear of the public : '' Sitzt ihr nur immer !

		Leimt zusammen , Braut ein Ragout von andrer Schmaus . ''

		The ragout which has been brewed in the present instance is made of bits taken here and there from both parts of the German original , stirred up with other bits pro- vided by the adapters .

		The intention was obviously so to improve upon
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poem by rearrangement , omis - sions , and additions that the resulting '' adapta - tion '' would make an effective stage play for Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	Tree .

		No one can blame Mr.
Tree	PERSON	for wishing to emulate
Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	by adding a Mephisto to his achievements .

		As a stage manager he has as many '' machines '' and '' prospects '' as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Director , and what better use could he put them to than to make them serve him as actor in the role of the Devil ?

		Reports from
London	LOCATION	confirm that neither poet nor actor were mistaken in their estimate of a new Faust as a theatrical success .

		A glance at the contents will show the method employed .

		The prologue is retained , but the scene is changed from the original heaven to '' a range of mountains between Heaven and
Earth	LOCATION	. ''

		Mephistopheles , as the Satan of Scripture , makes his wager , not with the Lord , but with an angel '' sent down from bliss . ''

		The divine messenger assures Mephistopheles of the futility of his attempts against
Faust	PERSON	, who '' through the woman-soul at last shall win , '' a prophecy clothed in the famous closing words of Part Second .

		At the end of the prologue the machines and prospects have a chance : Mephistopheles , amid thunder and darkness , '' with wings outspread swoops suddenly like lightning downwards to the earth . ''

		At the beginning of

		to have his way with some condensing and re - arrangement , untn after the Easter music , when
Faust	PERSON	, recalled from his suicidal attempt , remembers that seeking the light he has not yet called upon darkness .

		He raises the sign of the hexagon , speaks his formula ; a flame leaps in the hollow of the chimney , followed by a vapor from which emerges the form of his future friend and tempter .

		The Easter walk and the poodle are thus entirely dispensed with except a few lines which for their poetry 's sake are woven in here and there out of their original con - nection .

		The compact is soon made , the student is disposed of in a few lines , and , accompanied by a roll of thunder , the pait are whisked away to emerge in '' a world of cloud and vapour . ''

		When the clouds have disappeared , we do not find the two travellers in
Auerbach	LOCATION	's
Keller	PERSON	or the Witches ' Kitchen , but on a ledge of rock looking into a deep torn fissure in the earth , in whose depths is the Witches ' Cavern .

		In a neighboring hollow of the rock '' ' T is said that once ere
Eden	ORGANIZATION	's lawns had flowered The Mother of the Mother of the world Lay hidden . ''

		Now it serves as background for '' a vision of a figure nearly nude and draped by the growth of leaves about her form , in which she seems partly incorporate . ''

		Faust drinks the witches ' cup , thunder crashes , there is a blinding flash of lightning , after which the rejuvenated Faust stands forth clad in rich garments . ''

		Mephis - topheles with a red glow upon his face , and the witch surroimded by her Attendant Apes , '' join in a wild dance , when the curtain falls .

		This analysis of the first act will serve to show the method of the adapters .

		Goethe has been retained where he conforms with the end in view ; where not , new matter has been sub - stituted .

		The purpose of the new '' Faust '' is manifestly an attempt so to simplify and unify the '' Faust '' of Goethe that it will not make too great a demand upon the intelligence and culture of the theatre-going public of to-day .

		To carry out this purpose , it was necessary to sacrifice the more subtle ideas of the poet 's philosophy ; for what does the modern theatre - goer care about the ethical content which the great world-poet put into the foolish old legend ?

		It is the realism of the love story and the dia - hlerie which appeal to him .

		The Weltschmerz of Faust finds no echo within his breast .

		Hence the soliloquies and other passages in which
Faust	ORGANIZATION	gives expression to his trouble have been either omitted or greatly condensed .

		As a result the role of the hero has been so much reduced that
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 it serves for but little more than the occasion for
Margaret	PERSON	's love and
Mephisto	ORGANIZATION	's magic .

		The spectacular side of the adaptation can - not fail to satisfy the most insatiable appetite for '' thrills . ''

		As the adapters had it in their power to improve the unity of the action , one would naturally expect a minimizing of the Walpurgis-nacht .

		But no ; here was too good an opportunity for carpentry and colored lights .

		The very stage directions make the reader shudder .

		There is thunder and lightning and a raging wind .

		On separate peaks witches are posted as sentinels , the crags and mountain tops are filled with shadowy forms whose voices echo across the gulf .

		Mephistopheles asks his compan - ion , '' Would ` st know my power ? ''

		whereupon '' the rocks have sundered and fallen .

		Uprooted trees have crashed into the abyss , and the moun - tain across the gulf has been so shattered as to leave a vast cavern in its side . ''

		Mephisto im - mediately finds use for the new-made cavern as a '' Fitting stage whereon we '11 summon for thy amorous glance From out their scattered tombs those
Queens	LOCATION	of Love Whom
Time	ORGANIZATION	hath still left peerless . ''

		Some young witches now draw
Faust	ORGANIZATION	with chains of flowers to a convenient spot for be - holding the pageant of beauty produced for his benefit , --
Helen	PERSON	of Troy , Cleopatra preceded by Egyptian dancing girls , and finally Messa - lina , '' passion 's ungrudging slave . ''

		Is Goethe 's '' etude in the uncanny and the gross '' improved by this interpolation ?

		However much the lover of Goethe may resent these tamperings , he must admit that the work of Mr.
PhUlips	PERSON	and Mr.
Carr	PERSON	has its merits .

		The two collaborators have succeeded admirably with the blank verse which they have substituted for the original metres .

		Many of the added lines , also , have undeniable beauty , and a portion of the love tragedy has been ren - dered into prose which grips through its simple pathos .

		But is a poet of Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's attain - ments justified in laying violent hands upon one of the world 's masterpieces in order to provide an ambitious actor-manager with a suitable vehicle for his talents ?

		A sentence from a German critic concerning a recent adaptation of '' Faust '' for the stage is apropos : '' Culture also has its commandments , and one of these is respect .

		He who does not see it and will not see it helps to make art the helpless plaything of artistic caprice , which is its destruction . ''

		All admirers of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	must regret that the cen - tenary of his greatest work has been marked by no more significant result than this English version .


Ellen C. Hinsdale	PERSON	.

		Records of an Inspiring liiFE .

		* The ancients , far from asserting the essential equality of men , were ever prone to exalt and even deify possessors of the strong arm or the cunning brain .

		Whether or not modem man is inherently more variable than his ancestors of a few thousand years ago , may be a matter for dispute ; but for practical purposes he is so , social inheritance having placed in his hands the means of accentuating his peculiarities to an extraordinary degree .

		On the other hand , the spread of democracy and education , the mixing of peoples and the diffusion of literature , have had and are having an equalizing tendency the value of which , for good or evil , can not yet be estimated .

		So far as human diversity has hitherto depended upon inequality or even dif - ference of opportunity or experience , it may be expected to decrease in the future ; so far as it has depended upon inborn traits , it may be expected to increase with the enlargement of the field of endeavor and the mass of material ready to the hand of the worker .

		Of these two tendencies , the first can not be regarded as an unmixed blessing , for some of the finest fruits of the human mind are closely connected with the concentrated effects of a limited environment ; while the second may prove to be decreased by the mixing of peoples and consequent diffusion of special traits , or spoiled by the combination of incongruous elements .

		The recognition of the fact that mankind is half - unconsciously entering upon a gigantic experiment of uncertain outcome does not come from the pessimists , but from those ultra-optimists who are quixotic enough to believe that he may be led to appreciate the situation , and , with the aid of science , find a way to a successful solution .

		To those who have any measure of this faith or hope , the life of Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	can not be other - wise than inspiring .

		When ability and oppor - tunity combine as they did in this instance , the benefits to humanity may be enormous .

		If the complexity of our social relations is involving us in ever-increasing difficulties , we find here some reason to hope that
Davids	PERSON	will be found to lay them low .

		The greatest danger is , no doubt , that we may not have the sense to accept their services .

		In the case of Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	-- or
William Thomson	PERSON	, as he then was -- recognition came early .

		190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, of the wonder and expectation aroused by his early performances .

		When he took his degree , one examiner remarked to the other -LRB- both being distinguished men -RRB- , '' You and I are just about fit to mend his pens . ''

		At the age of twenty - five he was appointed professor in the
University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	; we find in the book a portrait of him taken at this time , showing a face quite in keeping with the most romantic ideals of genius .

		At that time it was customary to teach the prin - ciples of dynamics and electricity , so far as they were then understood , by means of lectures ; but the idea of experimental work had scarcely dawned upon the minds of the authorities .

		The apparatus was scanty and ancient , and the avail - able quarters wholly inadequate .

		It was not without some alarm , evidently , that the com - mittee of the faculty listened to the demands of the yoimg professor ; but he tried to be as reasonable as he could , while they , even in their official statement , could not forbear allusion to their `` anticipations of his future celebrity . ''

		The ardor with which
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	carried on his work was as remarkable as his genius in planning it .

		Everyone about the place was called upon to help , even visiting scientists from other institutions .

		As an example of his methods under stress of circumstances we are given the following .

		It was a question of making and testing certain newly invented batteries : '' A supply of sheet lead , minium , and woollen cloth was at once obtained , and the whole laboratory corps of students and staff were set to work to manufacture sec - ondary batteries .

		A small Siemens-Halske dynamo was telegraphed for to charge the cells , and the ventil - ating steam-engine of the
University	ORGANIZATION	was requisitioned to drive the dynamo during the night .

		Thus the Uni - versity stokers and engineer were put on double shifts ; the cells were charged during the night and the charging current and battery-potential measured at intervals .

		Then the cells were run down during the day , and their output measured in the same way .

		Just as this began ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	was laid up with an ailment which confined him to bed for a couple of weeks or so ; but this led to no cessation of the laboratory activity .

		On the con - trary , the laboratory corps was divided into two squads , one for the night , the other for the day , and the work of charging and discharging , and of measurement of expenditure and return of energy went on without inter - mission .

		The results obtained during the day were taken to
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's bedside in the
evening	TIME	, and early in the morning he was ready to review those which had been obtained during the
night	TIME	and to suggest further questions to be answered without delay . ''

		Another example is given in connection with his lecture course .

		`` The closing lecture of the ordinary course was usually on light , and the subject which was generally the last to be taken up -- for as the days lengthened in
spring	DATE	, it was possible sometimes to obtain sunlight for the experiments -- was often relegated to the last day or two of the session .

		So after an hour 's lecture
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	would say , `` As this is the last day of the session , I will go on for a little longer , after those who have to leave have gone to their classes . '

		Then he would resume after ten o'clock , and go on to eleven , when another opportunity would be given for students to leave , and the lecture would be again resumed .

		Messengers would be sent from his house , when he was wanted for busi - ness of different sorts , to find out what had become of him , and the answer brought would be , hour after hour , ' He is still lecturing . '

		At last he would conclude about one o'clock , and gently thank the small and devoted band who had remained to the end , for their kind and prolonged attention . ''

		This is no place for a summary of Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	's achievements , nor is it worth while to describe more minutely the contents of Professor Gray 's book ; but it may be recommended as an excellent condensed account of the life and labors of one of the most remarkable men of this or any other time .

Mary Gertrude Cushing	PERSON	's thesis on
Pierre Le Tourneur	PERSON	, published by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is one of the most readable contributions to literary history that have appeared recently .


Pierre Le Tourneur	PERSON	was one of the most useful of eighteenth-century French writers , although he is pretty well forgotten now , in
France	LOCATION	as elsewhere .

		His versions of
Young	ORGANIZATION	,
Hervey	PERSON	,
Ossian	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	PERSON	were the best fruit of a movement that stirred literary
France	LOCATION	to a con - sciousness of her great lack .

		French literature was dead , and it required an infusion of foreign blood to bring it to life .

		It is interesting to study the methods of a translator of two hundred years ago through the spectacles of this brilliant young '' Doctoress , '' -- his readiness to add , subtract , alter , his painstaking readjustment of parts , his calm con - fidence in the value of his work though Voltaires vilified and LaHarpes hooted , his patient devotion of a life to a rather thankless task , -- for there is truth as well as cleverness in
Miss Cushing	LOCATION	's adapta - tion , `` The way of the translator is hard . ''

		Le Tourneur 's knowledge of English was far from perfect , as is shown by his transformation of the scientist Sparrman 's statement -LRB- in view of his employment as tutor to a family who lived among the
Hollanders	ORGANIZATION	at the
Cape	LOCATION	-RRB- , '' I had made shift to pick up a little German on my journey from
Grottenburg	LOCATION	, '' into '' Je m ' ^ tais attach ^ avec beaucoup de peine un petit Allemand . ''

		However , his judg - ment was better than his scholarship .

		He knew what Frenchmen would read , and if his Shakespeare is not ours he is at least a dilution that gave his countrymen a taste for something more vital and vigorous than their native writers had been furnish - ing them .

Sofia	LOCATION	last year , how he succeeded in finding the
Revolutionary Committee	ORGANIZATION	which had the direc - tion of the insurrection in
Macedonia	LOCATION	, and in getting himself attached to one of the chetas -- little bands which make sallies far into the enemy 's country , and do duty as organizers , messengers , spies , fighters , as occasion demands .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	was privileged to help perform all the functions mentioned , to spend some time in the company of
Madame Tzveta Bojova	ORGANIZATION	, the Bulgarian
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , and to get a pretty clear idea of the Balkan difficulty , or at least of the Bul - garian side of it .

		The little Bulgarian state , with a population of 4,000,000 , has an army of 400,000 men -- the best fighters in southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	-- and has succeeded in every one of her large enter - prises thus far : has annexed
Eastern Koumelia	ORGANIZATION	, has forced Servia and
Greece	LOCATION	to keep their hands off , has seized the
Orient Railway	ORGANIZATION	, and has made herself entirely independent of
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		In the meantime ,
Macedonia	LOCATION	, of about the same population as Bul - garia , and for the most part of the same blood , has wasted her energies in trying to throw off the Otto - man yoke , and is in a pitiful state of misery and unrest .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	found the Bulgars and
Mace	ORGANIZATION	- donians a childlike , generous , and delightfully friendly and sympathetic people -LRB- where the Turks , Greeks , and Serbs are not concerned -RRB- , enthusiastic admirers of
America	LOCATION	, and inclined to copy her in some directions where she is perhaps not the best of models -- in the matter of political activities , for example .

		The story is elaborately illustrated with photographs , and supplemented with two excellent maps , one showing the whole Balkan region , and the other giving such a detailed view of eastern
Macedonia	LOCATION	as can be found in no ordinary atlas .

		There is more of hardy adventure and hair-breadth escape from thrill - ing danger in '' The Life of a Fossil Hunter '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.

Sternberg	PERSON	's is a name held in merited honor among paleontologists .

		Professor
Osborn	PERSON	of the

		As it is the handi - capped that often win in the race of life , so we find Mr.
Sternberg	PERSON	crippled by an unlucky fall in child - hood , and otherwise hampered by obstacles that would have dampened a less glowing ardor at the outset .

		It is the overcoming of these obstacles and the triumphing in spite of them that gives so human and absorbing an interest to his very real and event - ful narrative .

		Many visitors to museums have seen his name attached to specimens and collections that owe their discovery and preser - vation to his industry .

		The honor of it all he rightly insists on enjoying , even at some sacrifice of pecu - niary returns in many instances .

		In closing his book the author devoutly gives thanks that he has '' raised up a race of fossil hunters '' in sturdy sons who will carry on his work after he is dead .

		The special merit of ''
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	: mIZ ^ I '' !

		The Man and his Plays '' -LRB-
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	, is the thoroughness with which it reflects the recent literature of the subject .

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	has availed himself of pretty nearly everything acces - sible , and has drawn upon the vast mass of material with intelligent judgment , skilfully constructing for us a portrait of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as the man is revealed in the werk of his previous biographers , in his own corre - spondence , and in his writings .

		The book is much fuller and better than the sketchy production of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, and it has , of course , an advantage over
Jaeger	PERSON	's standard biography in covering
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's whole life , and in possessing the many facts that have come to light since his death .

		Ibsen is studied throughout the work as a product of his environ - ment , and the plays are shown to be logically related to '' the conditions , both social and temperamental , which preceded their composition . ''

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	has also a just sense of the relative values of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's works , and knows perfectly well that '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt '' will be reckoned great literature when '' Ghosts '' and '' A Doll Home '' are only curiosities of the history of culture .

		A very large amount of bibliographical material is given , and hardly anything of importance , in the way of criti - cism or of translation , seems to have been missed .

		But the author has not discovered the very remark - able translations of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's poems by Mr.
Percy Shedd	PERSON	.

		In connection with each of the plays , we have not only a bibliographical note , but also the chief facts about its first performance in several countries .

		Altogether , Mr.
Moses	PERSON	has made a useful book , adequate in scholarship and sound in judgment .

		The belated ^ ^ ^ f nearly fifteen years since
David	PERSON	biography of a Swing died in what should be the great preacher , prime of a man 's life , the age of sixty-four ; and only to-day do we have his full and formal biography . ''

		David Swing : Poel ^ Preacher '' -LRB-
Unity Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from the pen of the Rev.
Joseph	PERSON
Fort Newton	LOCATION	, by its excellence as a character portrait goes far toward atoning for its lateness of appearance .

		The eloquent and lovable and thor - oughly human teacher of the multitudes that used on
Sundays	DATE	to throng Central Music Hall in
Chicago	LOCATION	is most engagingly presented in the fair pages of this attractive octavo .

		The comparatively humble origin of the man , his simple , almost Spartan-like upbringing , his determination to get an education in spite of insufficient means , his inward call to the ministry , a call obeyed with much diffidence and self-doubting , his growth in greatness of soul , and his final bursting of the bonds of creed and the trammels of dogma , -- all this , and more , is well recounted by Mr.
Newton	PERSON	.

		As a characteristic utterance of Professor Swing 's , and as defining his attitude in a certain great crisis of his life , let us quote these words from one of his sermons : '' It has easily come to pass that the most useless and forlorn men on earth have been the professional heresy-hunters .

		Living for a certain assemblage of words , as a miser lives for his labeled bags of gold , they have always left their souls to go dressed in rags and to die of famine in sight of the land of milk and honey . ''

		To readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, at least to its older readers , Swing as a writer is no stranger ; some of his best essays , notably that on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, first appeared in its columns .

		The life and work of a man who , as his biographer observes , may fairly be classed with
Beecher	PERSON	and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, can not be lacking in human and spiritual interest .

		Mr.
Newton	PERSON	has well filled a gap in our biographical literature .

		We are told by Sister Nivedita -LRB- Miss S ' ^ fndut ^ .

		Margaret E. Noble -RRB- , the compUer and narrator of '' Cradle-Tales of
Hinduism	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , that we are here offered a collection of genuine Indian nursery tales , and that in bringing them together she has `` preferred the story received by word of mouth to that found in the books . ''

		The stories are the old , old tales of
Hinduism	LOCATION	-- those of the
Mahabharata	LOCATION	, the
Bhagavat Purana	LOCATION	, and the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some come from less lofty sources , and are really popidar village tales .

		All exhibit the wildest Indian fancy and reflect the Hindu psychology .

		A cycle of ten Krishna stories perhaps represents the narrator at her best .

		Through all the stories there runs a strain of sadness and a certainty of impending doom .

		Figure after figure comes upon the scene to play an automatic part only to suffer a destined fate .

		Sister Nivedita is partic - ularly impressible to this fatalistic note , and over - emphasizes it in her work -- by selection , indeed , rather than by magnification .

		The collection is good and the stories are well narrated , though Sister Nivedita continues ever on the same minor strain , never rising to heights of passion or sinking to depths of despair .

		Notwithstanding her sympathy , her contact with the Indian life , and her native helpers , she never loses herself in the story ; she is always outside of it , conscious of the part of narrator , always looking at her tale as a curio to be studied or a parable with a meaning .

		, .

		„ , Dr.
David M. R. Culbreth	PERSON	, an alum - Stuaent days at '' i xt • • e tt - • • i the
University nus of the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, has of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		written an interesting account of his life as a student at the
University	ORGANIZATION	, with sympathetic personal sketches of the members of the faculty during the period of his attendance -- 1872 -- 7 .

		The volume is published , with a number of illustra - tions , by the
Neale Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		It is a good sign when a graduate of an institution of learning preserves so long his affection and loyalty toward his alma mater .

		It is evident that the author of this book fully imbibed the spirit of the university , which has been tersely character - ized by one of its most distinguished alumni , the late
Bishop Dudley	PERSON	, as `` thoroughness and honor . ''

		In these days of depreciation of an old-fashioned collegiate education and the exaltation of material pursuits , it is refreshing to turn back to these rec - ords of over a quarter of a century ago .

		The early chapters give an account of the founding of the university by
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, whose '' lengthened shadow '' is still seen in its organization , although aliquantum mutatus ah illo .

		A series of such vol - umes would give opportunity for a comparative history of educational institutions , and would be a valuable contribution to the history of education in this country .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' A Commentary on the Holy Bible by
Various Writers	ORGANIZATION	, '' under the editorship of the Rev.
J. R. Dummelow	PERSON	.

		This is a single-volume work of more than a thousand pages , with an extensive list of contributors from both sides of the water .

		It gives us a series of about thirty essays of a general character , which precede the commentary proper .

		A few maps are furnished , but no other illustrations .

		This work is published at a very moderate price , and should prove widely useful to clergymen , teachers , and the laity . ''

		Utopian Papers , '' edited by Miss
Dorothea HoUins	PERSON	, comes to us from
Messrs. Masters & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		It is a collection of nine popular essays having for their common purpose the discovery of '' the resources of con - temporary science and hterature , art and religion , avail - able for the regeneration of our cities and their inhab - itants . ''

		Among the titles are '' Sir Thomas More Redivivus , '' `` Chelsea , Past and Present , '' `` Comte 's View of the Future of Society , '' '' Goethe , '' and '' Indian Thought . ''

		The papers are really lectures given before '' the Utopians , '' a small group of ardent souls assembled in
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		Something over a year ago , a course of twenty-one pubUc lectures was given by members of the faculty of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, each lecture being the effort of a specialist to present in non-technical language the pres - ent status and the outlook of his own department of knowledge .

		These lectures were published separately in pamphlet form , and were thus given a considerable circulation .

		A limited number of sets of these lectures have now been bound together , making an imposing volimie which should find its place in many libraries .

		Their subjects cover the chief fields of science , history , and philosophy , and the treatment is made attractive without too great a concession to the tastes of a popular audience .

		Among the more notable lectures are the '' Mathematics '' of Professor
Keyser	PERSON	, the '' Biology '' of Professor
Wilson	PERSON	, the '' History '' of Professor
Rob	PERSON	- inson , the '' Jurisprudence '' of Professor
Smith	PERSON	, the '' Philosophy '' of President
Butler	PERSON	, and the '' Sociology '' of Professor Giddings .

		A recent addition to the Messrs ,
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	' '' Draw - ings of the Great Masters '' series illustrates the draughts - manship of
Antoine Watteau	PERSON	.

		A critical foreword by
M. Octave Uzanne	ORGANIZATION	points out the masterly quality of the drawings , besides characterizing the finished work of this matchless painter of coquetry , frivolity , enchant - ment , -- belonging half to eighteenth century
France	LOCATION	and half to fairyland .

		There are fifty full-page drawings , chosen from the collection in the
Louvre	LOCATION	and the Brit - ish museum , reproduced in tint .

		A unique supplementary reader is offered by the
American Book Company	ORGANIZATION	, under the title ''
Chinese Fa	ORGANIZATION	- bles and Folk Stories . ''

		Miss
Mary Hayes Davis	PERSON	un - earthed and translated the stories , with some assistance from the Rev.
Chow Leung	PERSON	; thereby upsetting the ac - cepted theory that the Chinese had no fables .

		An intro - duction by the professor of the Chinese language at
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	attests to Miss
Davis	PERSON	's right to the honor of having discovered the Chinese fable to the Western world .

		Under the skilled editorship of Mr.
A. T. Quiller	PERSON	-
Couch	LOCATION	, the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has begun publi - cation of a '' Select English Classics '' series , intended primarily , we suppose , for school use .

		The first titles to be issued , some twenty-five in number , range over the whole field of English literature , each book consist - ing of thirty-two or forty-eight pages of selections from a single writer , with a brief introduction in which Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	manages to say the necessary things in an interesting way , without intruding the obvious .

		Liter - ature in tabloid form was never made more attractive than in this series .


Charles Wells	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	in the
last year of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		He died in
1879	DATE	, at Mar - seilles .

		At the age of twenty-four he wrote , and pub - lished pseudonymously , a poem entitled ''
Joseph	PERSON	and his Brethren : A Scriptural Drama . ''

		This is not a taking title , and it is not surprising that the public paid slight attention to a book thus named .

		Many years later , it was rediscovered by three men whose opinions counted : namely , by
Rossetti	PERSON	, Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	, and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		They insisted that it was a great poem , and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	wrote of it in terms of glowing praise in '' The Fortnightly Review '' of
1875	DATE	.

		The next year , the aged author had the satisfaction of see - ing his work in a new edition , with Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's essay .

		Somehow this edition found purchasers enough to exhaust it , and of late years the book has been hard to procure .

		The poem now comes to its own -LRB- whatever that may prove to be -RRB- by reproduction as a volume of the `` World 's Classics '' of Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		By way of prefatory matter , we are given Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's essay , and some forty pages of mixed gossip and criti - cism , entitled ''
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Charles Wells	PERSON	: A Remin - iscence of Kelmscott Manor , '' by Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	.

		All of these features , to say nothing of the poem itself , certainly make a sufficiently generous shilling 's worth of the book .

		194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Notes .

		A new novel by ''
Frank Danby	PERSON	, '' author of '' The Heart of a Child '' and `` Pigs in Clover , '' will be pub - lished next month by the

James Huneker	PERSON	, to be called '' Egoists , '' and to include studies of such men as

		Dr.
William Ellery Leonard	PERSON	has done a notable ser - vice to classical literature by publishing '' The Fragments of Empedocles '' in acceptable English verse , accompa - nied by the original text .

		He provides an introduction , a bibliography , and some twenty-five pages of notes .

		This work comes from
the Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

Spring	DATE	in their '' Riverside Special Editions '' a reprint of Wal - ton 's '' Compleat Angler , '' embodying some unique fea - tures , and a collection of contemporary records of the great
Boston	LOCATION	fire of
1872	DATE	, to be edited by Mr ,
Harold Murdock	PERSON	.

		Mr.
DeMorgan	PERSON	writes his publisher , Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, that he is still busily at work on the manuscript of his new novel which has been announced as '' Blind
Jim	PERSON	, '' al - though he himself does not care for this title , and will probably change to '' It Never Can Happen Again . ''

		Mr.
DeMorgan	PERSON	says it will be longer than ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' or '' Somehow Good . ''

		`` A Library Encyclopaedia , '' to be issued by subscrip - tion , will , if the plan meets with enough encouragement , be edited by Mr.
Alexander Philip	PERSON	of the
Gravesend	LOCATION	-LRB-
England	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library .

		The various articles will be written by '' only the foremost authorities , '' it is an - nounced ; and if the prospectus proves to be sufficiently inviting to the library world , the work will make its appearance at the end of this year .

Albany	LOCATION	, died in that city
February 25	DATE	, at the age of sixty-one .

		Dr.
William Bradley Otis	PERSON	's critical study of `` Amer - ican Verse , 1625-1807 , '' to be issued at once by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is based upon a careful investigation of the original editions in all the older American libra - ries , and much of its material has never before been mentioned in any history or bibliography of American verse .

		The book will contain an exhaustive bibliog - raphy and a careful index .

		A volume entitled '' Characters and Events of Roman History , '' by Professor
Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	, is annoimced by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The book consists of a series of studies of the great men and women of ancient

Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.


James A. Le Roy	PERSON	, secretary to

Durango	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, died
February 28	DATE	, in the military hospital at
Fort Bayard	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Le Roy	PERSON	contributed numerous articles to the periodical press on matters re - lating to the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		He was an occasional con - tributor to The Dial , the present issue containing one of the last products of his pen .

		A rare old periodical , '' The Southern Literary Mes - senger , '' which reflected the literary life of the South from
1834	DATE	to
1864	DATE	, has recently been added , in a com - plete set , to the library of
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	, through the generosity of Mr.
H. P. Hilliard	PERSON	of
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		Few libraries and still fewer book-dealers can now point to a full set of this interesting old magazine on their shelves , and the institution at
Austin	LOCATION	is justified in tak - ing pride in this acquisition .

		Popular editions of
Marlowe	PERSON	and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, uni - form with '' The Shakespeare Apocrypha '' which Mr.
C. F. Tucker Brooke	PERSON	recently edited , are announced by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ''

		As already known , a library edition of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's Works , edited by Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	and Mr.
Percy Simp	PERSON	- son , has been in preparation at
Oxford	LOCATION	for some time .

		A recent English note announcing that Mr.
John Mur	PERSON	- ray was to undertake a '' Life of the Honorable Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	, '' by Miss
Alice Perkins	PERSON	, is American news by way of
London	LOCATION	, for
Miss Perkins	ORGANIZATION	is a

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in charge of the

Chicago	LOCATION	have arranged with
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to bring out immediately in book form the more important addresses delivered during the Centenary Week .

N. W. MacChesney	PERSON	, Chairman of the
Lincoln Centenary Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 195 the volume will be illustrated with portraits of the distinguished speakers , photographs of the Lincoln Monuments in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and reproductions of the bronze plaques placed in the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools in commemora - tion of the Centenary .

		The book can hardly fail to prove both interesting and valuable .

		The Rev. Dr.
Theodore Ledyard Cuyler	PERSON	, well-known as a Presbyterian clergyman and as a writer , died on
February 26	DATE	at his
Brooklyn	LOCATION	home , in his eighty-eighth year .

		He was a graduate of

1890	DATE	was pastor of the
Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	in the city where he died .

		He was prominent in public life , and , in
1856	DATE	, helped to organize the Republican party .

		He .

		was an indefatigable contrib - utor to the periodical press , and the author of a long list of books .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Spectator '' was one of the earliest mag - azines to carry general advertising , and the recent pur - chase of a complete file by
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	has enabled Mr.
Lawrence Lewis	PERSON	to make an interesting study of this advertising , in a book to be published by
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	this
Spring	DATE	.

		The volume is called `` The Advertisements of the Spectator : Being a study of the Literature ,
History and Manners of Queen Anne	ORGANIZATION	's
England	LOCATION	as they are reflected therein , as well as an illustration of the Origins of the Art of Adver - tising , with an Appendix of representative Advertise - ments now for the first time reprinted . ''

		Announcements of
Spring Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Dial 's annual list of books announced for
Spring	ORGANIZATION	publication , herewith presented , forms an interesting epitome of American publishing activities for the present
Spring	DATE	and coming
Summer	DATE	.

		All the books here listed are presumably new books -- new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		The omission from the present list of any prominent publishers in the regular trade is due solely to the fact that such publishers failed to respond to our requests for data regarding their Spring books .

$ 1.25	MONEY	net .

		Our special price , 50 cts .

		IN ` The Wind among the Reeds ' Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	becomes completely master of himself and of his own resources .

		... It is life , an extraordi - nary intense inner life , that I find in this book of lyrics , which may also seem to be one long ` hymn to intellectual beauty . '

		... In this vol - ume , so full of a remote beauty of atmosphere , of a strange beauty of figure and allusion , there is a ' lyrical cry ' which has never before , in his pages , made itself heard with so penetrating a monotony ... Here , at last , is poetry which has found for itself a new form , a form really modern , in its rejection of every artifice , its return to the natural chant out of which verse was evolved ; and it expresses , with a passionate quietude , the elemental desires of humanity , the desire of love , the desire of wisdom , the desire of beauty .

		BRIEFER MENTION 288 NOTES 234 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 235 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 286 THE COPYRIGHT ADVANCE .

		Among the measures rushed through the six - tieth CongTess on the last day of its official existence was '' an Act to amend and consolidate the Acts respecting copyright , '' and on the
first day of July	DATE	the code then adopted will go into effect as the law of the nation .

		It has taken several years of hard work on the part of the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	and of private persons interested in the subject to secure this legislation , and the country is to be congrat - ulated upon its enactment .

		It is , of course , a compromise measure in many respects , and it retains the odious requirement of manufacture in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		As long as we shall con - tinue to submit to the selfish exactions of typog - raphers and pressmen , and allow this blot to disfigure our copyright law , we must remain excluded from the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	and keep our heads lowered whenever the general question of fair dealing among nations comes up for dis - cussion .

		Nevertheless , there are gains in sev - eral directions , and we are perhaps brought a little nearer the day when we may come to be counted among the really civilized nations in our treatment of literary property .

		First of all , we may be grateful that our copyright law is at last intelligently codified .

		Instead of a bewildering collection of separate acts , imperfectly related to one another , and based upon few common principles , we now have a single comprehensive statute , of sixty-four sections and approximately nine thousand words , which makes it possible for a layman to find out for himself with reasonable certainty what the law is . ''

		For this relief , much thanks . ''

		We may hope in time to secure a better law , now that this preliminary step has been taken , and it is possible even for the reader who runs to survey the law which we now have , and thus get a clear idea of what is needed for its improve - ment .

		It is very satisfying to know that the term of copyright is now extended from forty-two to fifty-six years , and that the benefit of this ex - tension may be shared by copyrights now in force .

		The practical working of this provision may be shown by saying that it will protect for fourteen years longer a large part of the writ - ings of
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Aldrich	PERSON	; nearly all of the works of
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Parkman	LOCATION	, `` Mark Twain , '' Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
James	PERSON	; and many such pop - ular books as '' Little Women , '' '' The Man without a Country , '' ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	, '' '' Uncle Remus , '' and '' Rudder Grange . ''

		The books just named are a few of the many that would have gone out of copyright during the coming fourteen years ; the new law will postpone for an equal period the date of expiry .

		The pirate who thought to make '' Little Women '' and * ' The Man without a Country '' his prey next year , and '' The Story of a Bad Boy '' and '' Innocents Abroad '' the year after , will now have to curb his unrighteous inclinations until
1925	DATE	or thereabouts .

		Looked at in another light , it is to be observed that the fifty-six year term practically insures an American author the control of his own writings as long as he lives ; this provision falls far short of the Berne recom - mendation of lifetime and fifty years thereafter , and of the practice of many of the more enlight - ened nations , but it marks a substantial step in the right direction .

		The vexed question of musical compositions , which has been largely responsible for the delay in coming to an agreement upon the whole sub - ject of copyright , is now settled by a compro - mise which embodies a new principle , but which should prove reasonably satisfactory to the two interested parties , the composer and the manu - facturer of instruments for the mechanical repro - duction of music .

		To begin with , the composer is free , if he wishes , to prevent any form of mechanical reproduction .

		In case , however , he licenses such reproduction at all , or himself prepares and offers for sale the mechanical devices for such reproduction , no one shall have a monopoly of the composition in this form , since '' any other person may make similar use of the copyrighted work upon the payment to the copyright proprietor of a royalty of
two cents	MONEY	on each such part manufactured . ''

		The law applies , of course , only to compositions here - after to be copyrighted ; the manufacturer of rolls and discs may continue to make free , as heretofore , with all works now in the market .

		Every complicated piece of legislation is likely to contain one or more '' jokers , '' and we imagine that the new copyright law wiU be found fairly well supplied with them .

		The following words seem innocent enough , but will probably be found to mean a good deal more than the casual reader sees in them : '' Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid , prevent , or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained . ''

		The system of fixed and uniform retail prices for copyrighted books , which our publishers and booksellers have been struggling to secure , and which prevails generally in European countries , will probably be main - tained with greatly increased difficulty after this provision goes into effect .

		There may also be a '' joker '' in the requirement of binding within the limits of the
United States	LOCATION	for copy - righted books , and we should not be surprised if one were discovered somewhere in the para - graphs dealing with prohibition of importations .

		The manufacturing requirement of the old law providing for intei ` national copyright has at least been freed from one of its most obnoxious features .

		American manufacture is no longer to be a condition of copyright upon books printed in foreign languages .

		Since that stupid require - ment was made in
1891	DATE	, an average of about one foreign book a year has been given the fidl protection of American copyright , and even the selfish greed of the typographical interests could find nothing worth urging in its favor .

		From this year on , a Frenchman or a German may copyright his books in this country , unless some
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	shall examine them with a microscope , and find a tabooed English word concealed some - where in the contents .

		This suggestion is not a fantastic flight of the imagination , for it is the incredible truth that books in foreign languages are occasionally held for duty in our custom - houses because they contain some chance En - glish quotation , or book-title , or indexed word !

		It is needless to say that the new right now acquired by foreign authors will do not a little to promote international good feeling .

		Of the manufacturing requirement in general we must of course say that it is inequitable , and Mr.
G. H. Putnam	PERSON	neatly points out that it has no more foundation in logic than in justice .

		Other countries have a pi'otective policy , and give it effect in their tariff laws .

		Ours is the only one to '' confuse copyright law with requirements that are concerned simply with the interests of labor or of capital . ''

		One more subject calls for a brief analysis .

		For many years a triangular discussion has been carried on between our bookbuyers , booksellers , and publishers , concerning the importation from
England	LOCATION	of books copyrighted in both countries .

		The publisher naturally wants a monopoly of the American market .

		The bookseller is neutral , being as willing to supply his customers with one edition as with the other .

		The bookbuyer , being a person of individual tastes , thinks he ought to
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 be free to buy -LRB- the author 's rights being recog - nized in both cases -RRB- whichever edition he pleases .

		So far , our sympathies are entirely with the book - buyer , since the publisher who fears the com - petition of the English edition needs just that stimulus to encourage him in making his own edition no less attractive .

		But here comes the Copyright Act , telling the buyer that he may import a copy -LRB- two copies under the old law -RRB- for use , but forbidding the bookseller to import even a single copy for sale .

		This is rather hard on the bookseller , and we feel for him in his pre - dicament .

		But it can not be considered a very serious matter , for the imported copy must pay a heavy duty , and ninety-nine purchasers out of a himdred will either not go to the trouble and expense of getting the English edition , or will simply not know how to go about getting it at all .

		Still , we should like to see the bookseller free to place his customers ' orders for the English edition .

		If this were legalized , we can not help thinking that it would improve the looks of the average American edition of an English work , besides exercising a wholesome restraint upon its published price .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The compelling personality of Mk .

		Ches - terton persists in thrusting itself on the attention .

		It is his good fortune , or his misfortune , to be a public character ; and whether he is sympathetic or unsympathetic to us , he can not help being an object of interest and curiosity .

		On the whole , there is to most observers something irresistibly engaging in his generous amplitude of bulk , his outbursts of Homeric laughter , his unparalleled absent-mindedness , and , withal , the serene independence with which he pur - sues his appointed course .

		From the pen of one who has observed him well we take a few words of graphic description . ''

		Walking down Fleet street some day you may meet a form whose vastness blots out the heavens .

		Great waves of hair surge from under the soft , wide-brimmed hat .

		A cloak that might be a legacy from Porthos floats about his colossal frame .

		He pauses in the midst of the pavement to read the book in his hand , and a cas - cade of laughter descending from the head-notes to the middle voice gushes out on the listening air .

		He looks up , adjusts his pince-nesg „ observes that he is not in a cab , remembers that he ought to be in a cab , turns and hails a cab .

		The vehicle sinks down under the unusual burden , and rolls heavily away .

		It carries
Gilbert Keith Chesterton	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is the most conspicuous figure in the landscape of literary
London	LOCATION	.

		He is like a visitor out of some fairy tale , a legend in the flesh , a sur - vival of the childhood of the world .

		Most of us are the creatures of our time , thinking its thoughts , wearing its clothes , rejoicing in its chains ... He is a wayfarer from the ages , stopping at the inn of life , warming himself at the fire , and making the rafters ring with his jolly laughter . ''

		Zest and heartiness and the joy of living are qualities too admirable not to be cordially welcomed , even though their favorite medium of literary expression be the now much over-worked paradox .

		• • • '' A Book of Verses underneath the Bough , '' but probably without any accompanying Jug of Wine or Loaf of Bread , and certainly not in the midst of any Wilderness , may very soon be enjoyed by the patrons of the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, in the large new roof garden of the new building ; and , if it were not for fear of disturbing other readers , doubtless some sweet-voiced '' Thou '' would be provided to sing beside the luxurious lounger -- to such refinements of lettered ease have they attained in that far-away city of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		Let us quote the librarian 's description of this gar - den of delight , this aerial paradise crowning `` the magnificent new Hamburger Building at
Eighth	ORGANIZATION	and Broadway , one of the largest and finest modern structures in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		`` The roof gar - den , '' says Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	-- what went immediately before is the phraseology of the
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	-- '' of which this library was the American inventor , was thoroughly enjoyed during the two years in the
Laughlin	LOCATION	quarters .

		In the present location we have more than four times the space ,
viz.	LOCATION	, some 26,000 square feet .

		There is an added advantage of a magnificent outlook covering an unbroken horizon of mountains , city , and sea .

		The ' flower pots ' of this garden are all in place -- redwood receptacles large enough to grow a tree a foot in diameter ... As soon as this out-door reading room can be fitted up , it will undoubtedly fulfill and increase the former popularity .

		All kinds of tropical , semi - tropical and other trees and plants will be included .

		A large fountain ten feet in diameter is already installed .

		There is also a special section of the roof garden fenced off for the noon-day rest of the young women of the staff . ''

		Felt roofing , or carpet - ing one might call it , has been provided -- almost as pleasant to the feet and as noiseless as turf .

		If one were not unalterably attached to the '' effete East , '' what a temptation were here to emigrate to
Los Angeles	LOCATION	!

		... A sign of decay in the French novel seems discernible in certain recent developments in literary
Paris	LOCATION	.

		To encourage writers of fiction and to stim - ulate their best endeavors -- and , possibly , for a less disinterested purpose also -- a literary periodical of that city has founded a prize of three thousand francs to be awarded annually to the young author who shall have produced the best novel in the preceding two years , the verdict to be rendered by a jury of Academicians .

		The degi'ee of youthfulness neces - sary to entitle one to compete is not indicated in the 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, report that has reached us .

		M.
Paul Bourget	PERSON	, who has turned of late from fiction to the drama and has produced two plays of merit , writes an interesting letter on the novelist 's art as compared with the dramatist 's . ''

		At the time when I was entering upon a literary life , '' he tells us , '' we all adopted a regular cult for the art of the novel , which was only equalled by our disdain for the art of the theatre ; and we had no difficulty in showing what differences there were between the paintings of a
Balzac	LOCATION	, a
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, a
Goncourt	LOCATION	, and those of their dramatic rivals .

		Our immediate predecessors ,
Zola	ORGANIZATION	,
Daudet	PERSON	,
Ferdinand Fabre	PERSON	, and
Cladel	PERSON	, thought as we did , and about
1880	DATE	all the youthful French exponents of literature seemed to be novelists exclusively .

		The wind has turned since then , and there has been an extraordinary growth of dramatic works , which shows how foolish was our former disdain of the dialogue form .

		And judging from signs , it seems to be the other form -- the narrative -- against which the injustice of the newcomers is now lev - eled . ''

Washington	LOCATION	and to enjoy the facilities afforded by all the government libraries -LRB- twenty-six in number -RRB- , museums , collections , and laboratories , fails to commend itself irresistibly to our Congressmen , and the whole matter is pigeon - lioled for indefinite future consideration when times are less strenuous and other pending issues less burning .

		Nevertheless two public-spirited men have undertaken a thorough preliminary investigation of the ways and means that must be considered before intelligent action can follow .

		The
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	and the President of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	have made inquiries and have submitted a report , which is published as a Bulletin of the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	; and their findings are not in the highest degree encouraging .

		Only the most advanced investigators , it appears , are likely to work more profitably in a government bureau than in an ordinary graduate school .

		The preliminary theoretical training should be completed before the student turns his face toward
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The government has not at present the necessary room or instructors to engage in the post-graduate training of young men .

		Its offices and officers are needed for other business .

		This is not a positive barring of the door to per - sistent knockers , but it is a cogent dissuasive to all but a few ripe students and original investigators who know exactly what they want and how to obtain it .

		• • • Statistics -- Handle with care !

		Some such cautionary label might well be attached to the sta - tistician 's columns of harmless-looking figures .

		It is well known that anything and everything can be proved by the proper manipulation of these serried ranks and ordered files of innocent numerals , and that , too , without playing any tricks of misquotation or other jugglery ; but when , whether with malice prepense or without malign intention , there occurs a misquoting or misprinting of statistics , neither gods nor men can foresee what planet-shaking catastro - phes may ensue .

		The
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has marked the completion of its second decade of cheerful existence and increasing usefulness by the issue of an unusually readable yearly account of itself ; but in treating the subject of misleading registration figures as reported from other cities , it has indulged in some pleasant banter at the expense of Maiden ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, whose `` live i-egistration '' of card-holders it gives as 140,568 -- more than four times the population of that city as recorded in the last national census , and nearly twice the registration of its big neighbor , the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not surprising that the President of the
Maiden	ORGANIZATION	library board replies to this in a letter for which he desires as much publicity as possible -- to balance the publicity already given in various ways to this astonishing ratio .

		It appears that by some inadvert - ence in copying , or by some , confusion of card - holders with catalogue-cards , the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	librarian or assistant librarian -LRB- or , let us say , the office boy -RRB- has written the above-named 140,568 , whereas the proper number , duly given in its right place in the Maiden report , is 12,007 .

		Hence these smiles .

		, , , The ending of a novel is , to many readers , the all-important part of the story .

		A glance at the last page or the last chapter often settles the question , at bookstore or library , whether the book shall be taken or coldly rejected .

		An English novelist writes to '' The Author '' a letter of indignant protest against alleged unfairness on the part of a literary weekly in publishing a synopsis of his new book under the guise of a '' review , '' but containing only '' a single critical adjective '' to lend coloring to its pretense of being a review .

		This beti'ayal of the plot the injured correspondent is inclined to regai `` d as wanton disregard of the printed caution , '' All rights re - served . ''

		It is a nice question , in many cases , to determine just how much of a story , or of any book , should be outlined , or in some rough way repro - duced , in order to whet without satiating the reader 's appetite , and also in order to illustrate or justify the critical comments passed upon the work .

		But since so many readers of novels persist in entering them by the back-door -- in beginning their perusal with ''
Finis	PERSON	'' instead of '' Chapter I. '' -- it is doubtful whether booksales have been materially injured by indiscretions of the sort complained of by the nov - elist we have quoted .

		Yet the author should receive all the benefit possible to be derived from the curi - osity-stimulating elements in his book .

		A NEW world-language swims into our ken , and its peculiar merit , or fatal defect , lies in its thorough - going artificiality .

		It calls itself an a priori lan - guage , builds itself up scientifically from the very bottom , and resolutely refuses to ally itself with or base itself upon or take any faintest shade of coloring

		Inflectional endings are used , and even the vexed question of gender has , to some extent , been left to trouble the learner .

		Commendable is the modesty of Mr.

		In this tune the valiant
Martinetti	PERSON	goes on , picturing a veritable Sicilian earthquake of tumbling monuments of the past and levelled summits of ancient glory .

		He appears from his words to be about thirty years old and to count on ten years of destructive activity before the Oslerian age-limit shall consign him , as he expresses it , to the waste-paper basket like an old manuscript , when a younger man will promptly take his place in the battle line .

		POEMS OF AMERICAN HISTORY '' FROM THE COMPILER .

		A NOTE -LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		I have read the review of '' Poems of
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' signed by Mr.
Isaac R. Pennypacker	PERSON	, which appeared in The Dial of
March 1	DATE	, with considerable interest and amusement -- interest because of its impu - tation to me of various motives and predilections which I was wholly unconscious of possessing , and amusement because of the evident animus which underlies it .

		At the time the book was in preparation , Mr.
Penny	PERSON	- packer saw a notice of it somewhere , and very kindly volunteered to assist me in its compilation , sending me a number of poems by himself and others , relating to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, with the suggestion that they be included .

		Unfortunately , I found myself unable to use any of them , although I expressed my obligation to Mr.
Penny	PERSON	- packer in the introduction to the book .

		I certainly have no prejudice of any kind against
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and nearly fifty of the poems in my collection celebrate events which took place on
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	soil ; but I kuow of no poetry '' inspired by her civilization '' suit - able for the collection .

		I can conceive of no reason why I should have included
Whittier	LOCATION	's six-hundred-line poem on
Pastorius	PERSON	, with whom Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	seems to be somewhat obsessed .

		As to beginning the history of the anti-slavery agita - tion which resulted in the Civil War , with
Pastorius	PERSON	's protest written in
1688	DATE	, I might , no doubt , have found a precedent in the example of the illustrious
Diedrich Knickerbocker	PERSON	; but it seemed to me suiScient to go back to the organization of the
Anti-Slavery Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1833	DATE	.

		I do not state , as Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	would have the reader infer , that abolition agitation began in
1833	DATE	; in fact , I say very distinctly that '' by the begimiing of the nine - teenth century it -LSB- slavery -RSB- had been abolished in '' many of the states ; but I saw no reason why I should attempt to trace this early growth of the movement .

		The inclusion of the '' Hymn of the Moravian Nuns of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, '' in the chapter of the Revolutionary period dealing with '' The War in the South , '' seems greatly to distress Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	, but I can see nothing wrong with it , -- though this , of course , may be due to a '' local predilection '' of which 1 am unconscious .

		As Count Pulaski played a brilliant , if brief , part in the campaign , it seems to me natural enough to begin the accomit of it with
Longfellow	PERSON	's poem on the consecration of his banner .

		With Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	's charges of historical inaccu - racy it is , perhaps , scarcely necessary to deal .

		Whether
Keenan	PERSON	really did lead a charge at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, whether
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	was really the moving spirit of a coterie , whether
Pickett	PERSON	was really in the van of the famous charge at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, -- all these are questions which I must leave to the analytical historian .

		I was not writing an original history of
America	LOCATION	-- I was writing merely a running comment upon a series of historical poems , and I took my history as I found it from the best sources at my command .

		I may , however , remark in passing that for the statement concerning
Pickett	PERSON	, I have the authority of so careful a historian as Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	-LRB- History of the
United States	LOCATION	, Vol .

		IV. , p. 289 -RRB- .

		I note also that Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	calls the Union troops `` Federals , '' an expression to which Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	seems to object .

		I am aware , too , that the exact part played by
Keenan	PERSON	at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	has been the sub - ject of a bitter controversy .

		My version rests upon
General Pleasonton	ORGANIZATION	's account of the affair , which , as it agrees with the poem , seemed to me to need no further explanation , though I might have noted that its accuracy has been questioned .

		Concerning the poetic merit of some of the verses , I can only say that estimates of this sort are largely a matter of personal equation .

		But I venture to believe that few intelligent people will agree with Mr.
Penny	PERSON	- packer 's dictum that the cleverness of `` The Biglow Papers '' has `` evaporated , '' or that ``
New England	LOCATION	's Annoyances '' or ''
Lovewell	PERSON	's Fight '' should have been left buried .

		Much of the contemporary verse is negli - gible as poetry , but was included for reasons clearly set forth in my introduction .

		That some misprints and minor misstatements should creep into a work of such magnitude was almost inev - itable .

		These will , of course , be corrected .

		Mr.
Penny	PERSON	- packer himself points out two .

		I am glad to note that he considers the conception of the volume excellent , and concedes that the task has been carried out with some degree of patience and intelligence , and I can only regret that these merits seem to be overshadowed in his opinion by the '' errors of commission and omission '' to which he takes exception .

		A Memokial , of
LiIteuaky Friendships	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Familiar knowledge of the methods , phrase - ology , and varied '' tricks of the trade '' of modem journalism has been shown by Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	in the autobiographical chapters which he has entitled '' My Story . ''

		This familiarity has been expressed in racy comments on American newspapers and their interviewers ; it has also impressed the general style of many pages of his book .

		In his Introduction , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	tells his readers that his original intention was to revise and enlarge his '' Recollections of Rossetti , '' pub - lished a few years ago , but that the plan expanded into its present form of restricted autobiography .

		The scope of the book has been necessarily con - fined to Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's limited , and incomplete , years of productivity , and he has devoted the larger portion of his space to records of his friendly relations with literary artists and craftsmen .

		The chief interest is found in the nucleus of the story -- the revelations of
Rossetti	PERSON	and his small but choice coterie of friends as they were known by Mr.
Caine	PERSON	during the last few years of
Rossetti	PERSON	's life .

		There is a vehement and anti- climactic reaction for the reader , as he passes from the last impressive scenes in the life of the poet-painter to the concluding part of the book , wherein Mr.
Caine	PERSON	recites many details of his own experience as journalist and novelist , his mental struggles and monetary successes , and his scat - tered notes on such literary acquamtances as
Blackmore	LOCATION	,
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	and
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	.

		When Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's reminiscent study of
Rossetti	PERSON	first appeared , it was more popular with the general reading public than with the family and oldest friends of the poet and painter .

		In the recently published '' Family Letters of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	'' there is a direct reference to this book , in a letter from
Christina	LOCATION	to her sister-in-law -LRB- p. 122 -RRB- : `` We have been reading Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's memoir .

		Considering the circumstances under which his experiences oc - curred , I think it may be pronounced neither unkind nor unfriendly ; but I hope some day to see the same and a wider field traversed by some friend of older standing and consequently far warmer affection towards his hero ; who , whatever he was or was not , was lovable . ''

		Comparing the earlier version of
1882	DATE	with the present memorial to his friend , we realize that Mr.
Caine	PERSON	, in his revision , has improved • My Story .

		Illustrated .

		New York : the first edition , both in treatment and tone .

		The
Rossetti	PERSON	of this later portraiture is indeed more human and lovable .

		The general method , however , is too pathological to be entirely artistic as biography .

		The reader 's taste is occasionally offended by too bald revelation of certain details intimes of
Rossetti	PERSON	's physical and mental sufferings ; there seems to be too much loitering over the familiar craving for the fatal chloral and its subsequent effects upon the mental and moral nature of Rossetti . ''

		As a '' curtain-raiser , '' before the dramatic chapters of
Rossetti	PERSON	's life , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	gives a few glimpses of his own boyhood on the Isle of Man .

		With vividness he recalls the impres - sions upon his youthful memory made by the human drama enacted in this sequestered and patriarchal parish , with its loves , quarrels , super - stitions , ethical lapses , and religious fervor .

		Many of these characteristics have been previ - ously described by Mr.
Caine	PERSON	in his interesting historical sketch , `` The Little Manx Nation . ''

		.

		When he left this romantic environment to become apprentice to a Liverpool architect , he came under two strong influences .

		The first was
Ruskin	PERSON	and his teachings , and the result was certain '' flamboyant criticisms '' by Mr.
Caine	PERSON	upon modern architectural ideas and his advocacy of fraternal relations in society .

		The second and more important influence was
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	felt a deep interest in the personality and poetry of this man of genius , and defended him valiantly , in writings and lec - tures , against the strictures of
Buchanan	PERSON	and other critics who reviled
Rossetti	PERSON	as a chief -LRB- exponent of '' The Fleshly School of Poetry . ''

		A printed copy of Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's platform trib - ute to
Rossetti	PERSON	, in
1880	DATE	, was sent to the poet by his young admirer .

		It brought a gracious reply which was the first incident in a friend - ship that lasted for two or three years , until
Rossetti	PERSON	's death .

		The poet-painter seems to have reciprocated the interest of his young friend and estimated his abilities with kindness and confidence .

		He urged Mr.
Caine	PERSON	to abandon his poetical aspirations and to cultivate his skill in '' fervid and impassioned prose . ''

		To
Rossetti	PERSON	's suggestion that
Caine	PERSON	should '' try his hand at a Manx novel , '' and his interest in the Biblical stories that might be used as fictional models , may be traced the incentive which gave to the public '' The Deemster , '' '' The Bonds - man , '' `` The Manxman '' -- stories of
Manx	ORGANIZATION	customs and human tragedy which represent the author 's best work in literature .

		With reiterated conviction , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	assures 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, his readers that
Rossetti	PERSON	's melancholia and in - somnia , and their aftermath of narcotics , may be explained as remorse for two allied causes .

		The first of these causes , he believes , was the domestic tragedy of his friend 's life -- the mar - riage , from motives of loyalty , to his beautiful model , and the realization later that his heart was pledged to another .

		The second cause for remorse -- emphasized by Mr.
Caine	PERSON	, but possi - bly open to question by others -- was
Rossetti	PERSON	's consent to exhume and print his little book of verses after they had been buried for seven years in the coffin of the wife who had inspired them .

		This exhumation is called '' an act of desecration -- forfeiting the tragic grace and wasting the poignant pathos of his first consxmi - ing renunciation . ''

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	need not assure us that this solution of his friend 's sadness was '' written with a thrill of the heart and trem - bling hand , '' for we realize his intensity of feel - ing ; and he is sure that '' it is the true reading of the poet 's soul . ''

		In spite of his sincerity , how - ever , we may not be wholly convinced that he is right in all his premises and conclusions .

		Because of his brief acquaintance with
Rossetti	PERSON	, -- for it was brief , although intimate , -- it is not certain that he f uUy understood his hero 's nature , even in these later years , and he has seemed to over - emphasize certain temperamental traits .

		Perhaps the most graphic and dramatic chapter in this book is that called '' A Night at Cheyne Walk . ''

		Here is well portrayed
Rossetti	PERSON	's hospitality , his incisiveness of speech and sensitiveness of feeling , and the spell-bound admiration with which Mr.
Caine	PERSON	first beheld the painting ''
Dante	PERSON	's Dream , '' in his friend 's studio .

		In certain portions of his reminiscences , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has used a Boswellian method .

		He seldom gives letters or conversations in their entirety , but introduces excerpts and para - phrases , with occasional epigrams and retold stories -- such as
Rossetti	PERSON	's comments on Pre -
Raphaelitism	PERSON	; his advice to young authors , '' Work your metal as much as you like , but first take care that it is gold and worth work - ing '' ; or this amusing recollection of Long - fellow : '' The poet had caUed upon him during his visit to
England	LOCATION	and had been courteous and kind in the last degree , but having fallen into the error of thinking that
Rossetti	PERSON	the painter and
Rossetti	PERSON	the poet were different men , he had said , on leaving the house : ' I have been very glad to meet you , Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	, and should like to have met your brother also .

		Pray tell him how much I admire his beautiful poem , '' The Blessed Damozel . ' ' ''

		According to the biographer 's own confes - sions and self-reproaches , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	bungled deplorably by his tactless remarks and mis - taken though well-intentioned efforts to improve the condition of
Rossetti	PERSON	's health and spirits , especially during those lonely and critical weeks of companionship when the two men were house - mates in the Vale of
St. John	LOCATION	, as they had been for a few previous weeks in Cheyne Walk and were later at
Birchington	LOCATION	.

		But in spite of its blemishes of style , and its incompleteness of structure , '' My Story '' is interesting and illu - minating as a series of impressions of
Rossetti	PERSON	and his friends , Watts-Dunton ,
Madox Brown	PERSON	,
Philip Marston	PERSON	,
Shields	PERSON	, and others , and as a revelation of Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's own personality and convictions .

		In newspaper interviews and lec - tures Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has expressed his liking for Americans as he has known them during his four visits to our country .

		In one of the last chapters of this book he emphasizes anew his admiration for our national traits : '' I love
America	LOCATION	and the Americans .

		I love
America	LOCATION	because it is big , and because its bigness is constantly impressing the imagination and stimulating the heart .

		I love its people because they are free with a freedom which the rest of the world takes as by stealth , and they claim openly as their right .

		I love them because they are the most industrious , earnest , active , and ingenious people on the earth ; because they are the most moral , religious and above all , the most sober people in the world ; because , in spite of all shallow judgments of superficial observers , they are the most childlike in their national character , the easiest to move to laughter , the readiest to be touched to tears , the most absolutely true in their impulses , and the most generous in their applause .

		I love the men of
America	LOCATION	because their bearing towards the women is the finest chivalry I have yet seen anywhere , and I love the women because tliey can preserve an unquestioned piu'ity with a frank and natural manner , and a tine uidependence of sex . ''

		THE DIAl ^ 225
Germany	LOCATION	has acquired a new interest to us Anglo-Saxons .

		A year ago last fall a large delegation of English mechanics visited some of the principal North German manufacturing - cities , and spent some weeks examining into such secrets of trade as were not guarded against prying competitors .

		The growing good feeling between the rank and file of the two countries made the visit pleasant and probably profitable to the visitors .

		It is not in evidence that Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	, author of the latest sociological report on Ger - many , was among the visitors , but he may have gathered much of his material from that inspec - tion .

		His book on '' The Evolution of
Modern Germany	LOCATION	'' is written `` to tell British readers what they ought to know , and must know , if they would understand how it is that
Germany	LOCATION	has gone ahead so rapidly during recent years , not , however , by way of discouraging but of reassur - ing them .

		For there is really little mystery about
Germany	LOCATION	's industrial progress ; it has been achieved by means and methods which are open to all the world if only people will employ them .

		Science , education , application , and an equal regard for small as for large things , -- these in the main are the causes of
Germany	LOCATION	's success . ''

		But Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	deals , in his twenty-three chapters and five hundred pages , quite as much with political as with economic questions .

		There is a certain British bulkiness in his ma - terial ; yet for reference if not for continuous reading , for instruction if not for entertainment , the bidkiness may be condoned .

		A slight addi - tion to the bulk -- to wit , in the title -- would have precluded unwarranted expectations of pic - tures of literary and artistic
Germany	LOCATION	; for it is extraordinary how conscientiously all but indus - trial and political phases of life are avoided .

		The general reader will doubtless find among the most interesting chapters those on '' The Per - sonal Equation , '' '' Capital and Labour , '' '' The Workman , '' '' Cooperation , '' '' The Population Question , '' and '' The Outlook of Socialism . ''

		Commercial
Germany	LOCATION	has gained enormously by her dependence upon science , by her exact - ness of method , and by her consideration for the customer 's wishes . ''

		It is a common com - plaint that there are English dyers who will not bring theory -LRB- in other words , science -RRB- to bear upon their practice , but persist in the old guess - work which was good enough for their fathers . ''

		In the chemical industries there is a university - trained chemist to every forty workpeople , a ratio of science to labor probably excelled in no other country in the world . ''

		The German manufacturer has put away from him the anti- quated idea that the consumer exists for his benefit , and instead he acts on the principle that the buyer has a right to have what he wants , if it can be made .

		It is impossible to say how much trade has left
England	LOCATION	, never , perhaps , to return , owing to obstinate refusal to recognize this not unreasonable principle . ''

		And the merchant is equally alive to his patron 's convenience and his own interests .

		`` He does not expect foreigners to be expert in the German language , but addresses them in their own tongues -- often , no doubt , with peculiar variations of his own , -- and if letters will not answer the purpose the merchant goes himself or sends some one who is well able to do his business for him . ''

		An interesting instance is cited of the
Commercial Association	ORGANIZATION	of the city of
Stettin	LOCATION	, which for thirty years has prepared and sent abroad to
America	LOCATION	and the British colonies a certain number of young men with a stipend of
$ 375	MONEY	annually , whose business was to make commercial reports to the
Association	ORGANIZATION	and in general to '' tout '' the commerce of
Stettin	LOCATION	. ''

		The whole theory of trading as understood in
Germany	LOCATION	is that if business is worth having it is worth seeking . ''

		Perhaps the
United States	LOCATION	does not need instruction in this principle , and our consular agents are sup - posed to do for us what the young men of
Stettin	LOCATION	are pledged to do for their city .

		Personally , as Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	observes , the German workman '' walks well , works well , and looks well , '' which can not be said with so little reservation of his English fellow .

		The German 's superiority in this respect is attribiited in part to his military training , to the Govern - ment 's care for him , and to his frugal habits , his Genilffsamkeit , as manifested in the satis - faction that he takes in simply sitting in the parks and visiting . ''

		There is a certain uegativeness about this form of eujoyment which a man of active temperament might not readily appreciate , for a German workman can patiently sit for hours together upon a bench or a patch of sward silently smoking his cigar and gazing into space .

		It would be unfair to say that such a condition of mental inertia is necessarily unintelligent ; rather , it goes with the essential simplicity and naivete of the German nature , which is still on the whole frugal in its hedonism as in other things , requires no violent relaxa - tions , can make a little pleasure go a loug way , and can derive satisfaction from ti'ifles .

		The Germans have coined a word to describe this mood of passive content : it is the imtranslatable word , Behagen '' -LRB- p. 154 -RRB- .

		Among the improved conditions of the work - men , Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	notes the growth of partial or total abstinence from alcoholic drinks .

		The 226 THE DIAL , -LSB- AprQ 1 , growth of
Germany	LOCATION	in this direction has been ahnost as startling as that of the
United States	LOCATION	, though the two countries are still far apart in their attitude toward '' the drink . ''

		Twenty years ago it was difficult to obtain drinking water on railways and at hotels in
Germany	LOCATION	; to-day it is universally provided , and its use does not occasion comment .


Germany	LOCATION	has her Good Templar Lodges , her '' Society for the Suppression of the Traffic in Alcoholic Drinks . '' ''

		Trade union conferences exclude alcohol from their meeting-rooms , '' and Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	finds that the Socialists seek to wean the working - classes from alcohol on the theory that Capital deliberately uses the drink as a means to de - grade them . ''

		When large public works are constructed , the authorities require the contrac - tors to keep alcohol in the background in all their canteens and to give prominence to non - alcoholic drinks ... The conviction has taken hold of a large section of the workers that their industrial efficiency and their value as members of society will be increased by the practice of temperance . ''

		It may be added that since the preparation of Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's book another step in this direction has been taken in the prohibition of the sale of alcohol to soldiers in transit .

		The chapter devoted to Cooperation is inter - esting but too brief .

		It is remarkable how the intensely individualistic Germans have learned , partly under state tutelage , to combine for the common good .

		One German in every fifteen belongs to a cooperative society of one sort or other .

		In two squares the reviewer counted
last year	DATE	the offices of nineteen unions or com - binations of some sort .

		The Population problem is being studied intelligently in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		There is no foolish and unreasoning demand for larger families , but prudent study to care better for the children that are born .

		The
Motherhood Protection League	ORGANIZATION	has for its object '' to improve the position of women as mothers in legal , economic , and social matters , '' and in general to check infant mor - tality .

		Yet it may be said in general that ''
England	LOCATION	spares its women , where
Germany	LOCATION	spares its children . ''

		Each country has ample room for improvement in the other direction .

		A score of other subjects are handled with more or less completeness . ''

		The Outlook of Socialism '' is not treated with entire clearness , per - haps for the reason that the outlook is indeed hazy .

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	is discreet in avoiding prophecy .

		But his book is a valuable granary of fact for every student who would understand political and economic

1619	DATE	, a
House	ORGANIZATION	of Burgesses `` broke out '' -- to use the language of an angry official of the time .

		This was the first repre - sentative body on American soil , and for more than a century and a half it was the most import - ant assembly in the colonies -- as
Virginia	LOCATION	was , before the Revolution , the leading English colony .

		Throughout its existence the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	demanded and obtained for the Virginians all the rights of Englishmen , and some other rights in addition .

		The history of the political and constitutional development in
Virginia	LOCATION	is to a great extent the history of the development of the representative assembly , its disputes with the governor and others , and its growing influence over all other political institu - tions of the colony .

		History has shown in large degree how import - ant this body was , but the records which afford the opportunity for a final estimate have not hitherto been generally accessible .

		Now , how - ever , we are promised the publication of mate - rial that will throw light over the long existence of the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Library Board of the Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	has authorized the
State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	to publish all that can be obtained of the Journals of the
House of Bur	ORGANIZATION	- gesses back to
1619	DATE	.

		At present many gaps exist , but some of these will be filled before the enterprise is completed .

		The plan was formu - lated and four volumes were carefully edited by State Librarian
John Pendleton Kennedy	PERSON	; the editorship is now continued by his successor Dr.
H. R. McUvaine	PERSON	, who seems likely to keep the work up to '' the high standard set by Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	.

		The publication is in the reverse of chrono - logical order .

		The six volumes already printed reach from
1776	DATE	, when the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	passed out of existence , back to
1752	DATE	.

		Each volume contains , in addition to the Journal of the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, an Introduction by the editor , the proclamations of the governor , lists of the members of the assembly ' , and a good index .

		The fifth volume contains also the minutes of the
Committees of Correspondence	ORGANIZATION	.

British Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	and in the British Museum .

		Each volume has as a frontispiece a facsimile of some interesting page of an old journal .

		One feature of the work deserves , in the opinion of the present reviewer , severe criti - cism : that is , the use of antique type with the long yi and similar pecidiarities , not only in the documentary part of the work but also in the editorial notes and introductions .

		The Jour - nals are reprinted for use , and such printing makes use more difficult ; it also causes more slips in proof-reading .

		Nor are any of the fre - quent abbreviations written out in fidl .

		All this exact reprinting serves no good purpose , but is troublesome to the eye .

		It is not necessary to reproduce historical documents with such stere - otyped exactness .

		The little sheet of suggestions in regard to such matters , sent out some years ago by a committee of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, should have furnished a guide to the editor .

		The printing and binding are good -- the best ever done in the South , it is safe to say ; and for this , credit is due to the
Colonial Press	ORGANIZATION	of
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		The introductory sketches written by the editor furnish the historical background to the text of the Journals .

		Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	, in his introductions , amounting in all to nearly 200 pages , reprints many documents boimd together by a slight thread of editorial narrative .

		These documents , incomplete as the selection is bound to be , serve to throw light on the text , and wiU be of service to students who can not easily get access to the originals .

		For the most part , these documents are taken from
Hening	ORGANIZATION	's Statutes , the
Virginia Gazette	LOCATION	, the
Draper MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		in the Library of the
Wisconsin Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the
Bancroft Transcripts	ORGANIZATION	, and other materials in the

		Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	's narra - tive is sometimes carelessly put together .

		In the fifth and sixth volumes .

		Dr.
Mcllvaine	PERSON	changes slightly the editorial plan .

		The introductory sketch is much shorter , and is confined strictly to an account of the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	during the period covered by the volume ; illustrative documents are relegated to an appendix ; lists of members are printed once for each
House	ORGANIZATION	, not once for each session ; and duplication of foot - note references is reduced to a minimum .

		The journals themselves are reproduced ex - actly .

		The contents of such documents are so varied that comment is made difficult .

		But read in the light of history , the dry entries of the eventful twenty years before the Revolution become intensely interesting .

		Now for the first time can be satisfactorily traced the history of the leading American colony from the beginning of the French and Indian War to the outbreak of the Revolution .

		These volumes are especially valuable for the information made available relating to the closing years of the last inter - colonial war ; the growth of the West , and the Indian troubles that resulted ; and the develop - ment of the spirit of independence which led to the Revolution .

		When completed , the series will form the most valuable historical work undertaken by any
Southern State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Cambbii > gb History of English IjITERATURE .

		* Partly as a residt of influences emanating from
Germany	LOCATION	, the home of the grundriss , and
France	LOCATION	, the home of the encyclopedie , an era of organized effort in modern scholarship seems to have set in throughout
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Such a tendency is well worth fostering , if it be fostered in the proper way .

		Not least among the benefits conferred by a history of English literature whose fourteen volumes are to embrace an account of both main and lesser literary move - ments , and of secondary writers as well as those of first importance , from the beginnings down to the present day , and to whose making com - petent scholars in their several departments , scholars not only in
England	LOCATION	but the most eminent wherever they may be enlisted , are supposed to contribute , -- not least among the benefits con - ferred by a work of such an origin and scope must be the strengthening of a sense of solidarity among professed students of English throughout
England	LOCATION	and the English-speaking world .

		Aside from this unquestionable advantage , the precise function of '' The
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature '' will to some of us remain obscure .

		In relation to its subject , the work is not an encyclopedie or a grundriss in the French or German sense , although while plan - ning it the editors have had comprehensive French and German works in mind ; and it is not a history conceived in harmony with any model of long standing .

		It represents an effort to furnish a general survey of an entire field of *

April 1	DATE	, scholarship , to sum up the more or less tentative results of all investigations in the several parts of the field , and at the same time to perform the office of a completed work of art , such as any true history of literature aims to be .

		Unfor - tunately , for the present at least , and perhaps for centuries to come , an attempt to identify the offices of the scientist and the artist in dealing with the course of English literature as a whole and in detail must involve a confused perform - ance of either function .

		It would be possible , under the right kind of leadership , for a frater - nity of scholars to organize a purely scientific and structural work -- in this sense artistic -- which should do for English studies in particular what
Paul 's Grundriss	ORGANIZATION	has done for Germanic philology in general ; that is , it would be pos - sible , as it would be altogether desirable , to produce an encyclopaedia and methodology which should bring together the assured results of past investigation in the domain of English language and literature , and draw sharp lines between what is clearly known , what is probable , what is less probable , and what is certainly unknown .

		Such a work would have a definite function , as either Paul 's or
Grbber 's Grundriss	ORGANIZATION	has a definite function ; with an eye to a final synthesis , its immediate purpose nevertheless would be analytical , and for the mind first of all ; it would be in the nature of a new organon for the study of the English language and literature , taking the place of books like those of Elze and Kbrting , which were well enough for their time , but should now give way to a large cooperative undertaking .

		Although it would not seek to anticipate the one far-ofE divine event toward which the world of English scholarship doubtless moves , although it would not be an inclusive history of English literature , it would be a decisive step nearer to that wished - for consummation .

		On the other hand , a gifted scholar like Ten Brink , a man of varied powers and mature training , one who had himself made notable additions to our knowledge in diverse parts of the subject , and was possessed of the tact and perspective of genius , might again com - pose a relatively brief account of the main currents and personalities in our literature , and oifer us perhaps the most stimulating book , short of some congenial poet , that could be put into the hands of a beginner in English scholar - ship .

		The truth is , the editors of '' The Cambridge History '' seem to have gone upon the assump - tion that the history of English literature can be recorded as the history of the French lan - guage and literature has been in the monumental work of Petit de Jidleville ; or , let us say , as the history of Greek literature has been by those masters of their art and science , the brothers Croiset .

		But the conditions are very different .

		For a history of French literature , and still more for a liistory of the literature of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, the preliminary work has been accom - plished .

		One may say that preparations for the achievement of Alfred and
Maurice Croiset	PERSON	began with the critics of
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		For a definitive history of English literature the fun - damental labors have hardly begun .

		Texts must be edited , concordances and indexes made , final biographies written , -- all the care that has been lavished on the masterpieces of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	must \ -RRB- e lavished on the masterpieces of English ; and the chaff must be blown away .

		He that will have a cake out of this wheat must tarry the grinding , the bolting , and the leaven - ing , and after that the kneading , the making of the cake , the heating of the oven , and the bak - ing ; even then he must stay the cooling too , or he may chance to burn his lips .

		Of how many periods or writers in English literature may it be affirmed that the intensive study of them has gone beyond the grinding and the bolting ?

		Although a larger share of systematic study has been accorded to the period of Old English than to any other , still , up to the
year 1900	DATE	, when Professor Cook brought out his edition of Cynewulf 's '' Christ , '' not a single Old English text had received the measure of scholarly attention which the veriest fragments of Greek have been winning since the Italian renaissance .

		Of how many authors in English must we con - fess that in their case not even the grinding has begun ?

		On the other hand , for what material in the literature of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	was not the oven fairly hot before the middle of the last century ?

		To the present writer , then , the editors of '' The Cambridge History '' seem to have paid insufficient heed to the Aristotelian query , which the author of any work of science or of art ought to propound to himself at the outset , namely : What is the precise and single main effect which we wish , and can hope , to bring about by the use of such and such means , which are at our disposal , in the mind of such and such a person ?

		Instead , they seem to have said to themselves : Whereas there are adequate his - tories of certain other literatures , but none of English , let us forthwith proceed to organize one which in some respects shall be like a German grundriss , but in others like a finished

		possible to dispose of a few hundred copies to students who find the annual dues of the society almost prohibitive .

		The conception of the present volume arose from the fitness of the editor to produce such a work , rather than from the reverse process , more usual in societies , of deciding to publish a volume and then selecting an editor .

		The result is that this collection of documents is the product of a mind well trained for the work , and not the customary assemblage of illustrative material of slight coherence , bound within the covers of a book .

		In the well conceived and well written In - troduction , and in the selection of documents , Professor
Munro	PERSON	has presented to the public a unified picture of Canadian Feudalism in all its essential aspects , from its inception to its abolition in
1854	DATE	.

		The editor has already pub - lished the results of his researches in this field in his monograph on '' The Seigniorial System in
Canada	LOCATION	, '' in the
Harvard Historical Studies	ORGANIZATION	.

		We should not expect , therefore , and do not find , much that is new in the Introduction ; in fact , the aim has been to illuminate the printed documents rather than to make a study of the problems presented by Canadian Feudalism .

		Hence there is sufficient justification for the moderate use of footnotes and the avoidance of monographic style in the volume .

		Professor
Munro	PERSON	may be counted among the adherents of the '' new school '' of American historians , if the movement among the leaders of our younger historians may be dignified by such a name .

		The scholars of this movement are not distinguished from their predecessors so much by a difference in method , carefulness of procedure , or the discovery of new facts in American history , as by their point of view and the facts which they select for emphasis .

		In the present case , the comparison between
Parkman	PERSON	's interpretation of Feudalism and that of Professor
Munro	PERSON	is inevitable .

		Although
Parkman	PERSON	's '' Old Regime in
Canada	LOCATION	'' appeared in
1874	DATE	, it has held its place among scholars , and on our college reference-shelves , as the final word , for English readers , on Canadian Feudalism , imtil the present time .

		So much is this the case that it is a common saying among Canadian historians that no important work on their history has been done since Parkman .

		There can be no question of
Parkman	ORGANIZATION	's industry in collecting the material for his studies ; for anyone who has followed him closely realizes that very little escaped him , and that the facts of the subject were well known to him .

		Nor 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, can there be a question of his honesty .

		After collecting his material he has tried to give a judicious interpretation ; and it is here that he has failed to satisfy modern scientific require - ments .

		At the basis of his interpretation lie those
New England	LOCATION	experiences which had be - come so much a part of his consciousness that they were never dispelled by his travels .

		His judgment is provincial , not cosmopolitan .

		To him , French
Canada	LOCATION	spells absolutism , ecclesias - ticism , and feudalism ; and out of these have developed the institutional history of the north - ern province .

		Professor
Munro	PERSON	, on the contrary , sets him - self the task of discovering the causes of the peculiar institutions of
Canada	LOCATION	, and what were the elements of strength which made them fitted to survive in the primeval forest .

		He does not find in the conquest of the French colonies by
England	LOCATION	a reason for condemning their institu - tional system ; but rather is he interested in the '' remarkable defensive vigour of
New France	LOCATION	, '' the reason of which was this : ''
New France	LOCATION	derived advantage from the homogeneity of her population , her unity of interest and purpose , and her policy of diverting all political , social , and economic development into those channels which were considered most conducive to mili - tary efficiency . ''

		This was the more necessary on account of the large extent of territory which she was attempting to control , wherein the con - ditions were not '' unlike those existent in
Western Europe	LOCATION	during the ninth and tenth '' centuries . ''

		A comparatively small body of French colonists , surrounded on all sides by active enemies both white and red , unable at any time to rely upon aid from without , and dependent for their very existence upon their own military efficiency , might well have found in a system of feudal organization an institution well adapted to colonial conditions .

		Starting with this new view-point , Professor
Munro	PERSON	has been able to make a new interpretation of
Canadian Feu	ORGANIZATION	- dalism .

		When the selection of documents to be pub - lished has been so carefully made as in this volume , the reviewer should be cautious in crit - icizing .

		The mass of materials passed under review has been enormous , and the final choice of those to be printed was reached only after a due consideration of the needs of various classes of students .

		The omission of certain documents is therefore easily defended .

		Still , it is sur - prising that the editor has not chosen to include some of the decisions in lawsuits handed down by the Intendants or the
Superior Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these , the existing system is better displayed than in charters , edicts , dispatches , or instruc - tions , such as have been selected .

		This is pecu - liarly the case in the economic relations of the seigneurs to their habitants , a phase of the sys - tem that has been somewhat neglected by the editor in this volume .

		The institutions of
Canada	LOCATION	were not always what the French gov - ernment desired , nor what the magistrates of
New France	LOCATION	chose to describe .

		For the actual workings of Canadian Feudalism , therefore , it will be necessary to supplement the study of this volume with careful research in documents of a different kind , which are easily available in printed form , a fact which may justify their omission here .

		Professor
Munro	PERSON	has not attempted to trans - late the French documents , since '' a perfect translation would tax the knowledge of a trained jurist as well as the literary skill of a historical scholar . ''

		It seems to the reviewer that this was a sufficient reason for making a translation rather than an excuse for its omission .

		The special knowledge of the editor would have then been available for the interpretation of these extremely technical but valuable documents , and would have justified the extension of the work to two volumes if necessary .

		These criticisms are , after all , due to a differ - ence of opinion , and in no way touch the schol - arly method of the editor .

		The volume is an excellent example of American scholarship , bound and printed in a dignified style ; and the
Champlain Society	ORGANIZATION	is to be congratulated on the success of its undertaking .

		Should succeeding volumes reach the level of scholarship of the first three , the society 's publications will form one of the most important collections of source material issued in
America	LOCATION	.

Louis Philippe	LOCATION	.

		In holding office under three rigimes within a year ,
Rambuteau	PERSON	felt he was serving
France	LOCATION	, rather than exhibiting any unusual facility in changing masters .

		It was well that in the disastrous years of imperial collapse and abortive restoration there were men of trained administrar tive capacity who could see that the great organs of public life performed their ordinary functions until the crisis was over and the controversy be - tween
Napoleon	PERSON	and his enemies determined finally .

		Although
Rambuteau	PERSON	was of the ancient nobil - ity , and not of the imperial mintage , he remained at heart a Bonapartist .

		In
1830	DATE	he would have contributed to the enthronement of the
Duke of Reichstadt	ORGANIZATION	had there been any chance of success .

		These Memoirs were written , or rather dictated , in his old age .

		At this time his memory , said by his grandson to have been remarkable , was not free from liability to lapses .

		So many scenes pass be - fore his mind that few of them are described with that distinctness of outline and variety of color which make the charm of some French Memoirs .

		One is puzzled to know what reliance can be placed upon the details of conversations repeated after an interval of more than thirty years .

		It may be that , according to the classical example of
Thucydides	LOCATION	, where he could not recall the words or the drift of the talk he repeats what the personages ought to have said under the circumstances .

		This precaution need not apply to the repetition of the witty sayings of the men of the old rSgime who graced
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's court .

		The best of these is the reply of the
Comte de Narbonne to Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	, when , speaking of
Narbonne	ORGANIZATION	's mother , the
Emperor	PERSON	said : '' She has got no great liking for me , eh ? ''

		`` No , sire , '' was the response , `` so far , she has got no further than admiration . ''

		In the later pages of the Memoirs is a detailed analysis of the improvements which
Rambuteau	ORGANIZATION	introduced in
Paris	LOCATION	as prefect .

		To stu - dents of Parisian history this will be particularly interesting .

Cranford	LOCATION	seems somewhat composite here and there -RRB- , when he wrote his book .

		Proper names , of course , are carefully changed , and a tantalizing vagueness enshrouds the ostensibly clear and minute details .

		But each reader will like to do his own guessing ; therefore any surmise on the reviewer 's part would be out of place and unfair .

		An especially alluring chapter to those of bookish or antiquarian tastes is entitled '' The Public Library , '' and begins in this pleasant strain : '' As I pass along early this

Italy	LOCATION	, and why so many others are ready to read them ; and this is doubtless why '' Home Life in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been written by ''
Lina Duff Gordon	PERSON	. ''

		For some months she and her family dwelt in an old fortezza in an isolated valley of the
Carrara	PERSON	mountains , while her husband -LRB-
Aubrey Waterfield	PERSON	-RRB- made paintings or drawings of the scenery and the people .

		They came in somewhat closer touch with the Italian peas - ants and artisans than strangers commonly do , and they entered into the village life with sympathetic appreciation .

		The book is a pleasing record , by means of pen and picture , of their individual experi - ences .

		Lovers of
Italy	LOCATION	will enjoy sharing these , but the title '' Home Life '' is somewhat delusive and altogether too large for the occasion .

		There are indeed some chapters of generalities relating to such subjects as courtship , marriage superstitions , country fairs , etc. , but most of this is already familiar knowl - edge .

		The chief merit of the book is its somewhat piquant way of describing the daily household inci - dents , those that involve the doings and sayings of children and servants , the marketing , the hours in the garden , etc. , such minor but interesting things as we welcome in the well-written letters of a per - sonal friend .

		Besides thirteen illustrations made from Mr.
Waterfield	PERSON	's pictures , there are fifteen more from photographs taken by the author and her friends .

		Scottish dame * of distinction . ''

		A Group of Scottish `` Women '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- is the title chosen by Mr.
Harry Graham	PERSON	for his collection of character sketches of representative North British leaders of the fair sex .

		Seven centuries , from the thirteenth to the nineteenth , have been drawn upon for illustrative matter , and a score or more of noted women , from
Dervorguilla	LOCATION	to Miss
Clementina Stirling Graham	PERSON	, are passed in review , with fifteen more or less authentic portraits to increase the interest .

		Various are the types of character repre - sented : thus we have
Elspeth Buchan	PERSON	, the religious fanatic ; Lady
Grisell BaUlie	PERSON	, the stout-hearted and resourceful patriot , `` a pattern of her sex , and an 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, honour to her country , '' as her epitaph puts it ;
Jane	PERSON	, Duchess of
Gordon	PERSON	, the politician ; '' Black Agnes '' of
Dunbar	PERSON	, the Scottish
Amazon	LOCATION	; Miss `` Nicky '' .


Murray	PERSON	, the leader of fashion ; Miss
Anne Barnard	PERSON	, the woman of the world ; Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	of
Laggan	LOCATION	, the blue-stocking ; and others of sundry sorts of eminence .

		Of remarkable range has been the author 's reading among old memoirs and chronicles , and most diligent his note-taking .

		His authorities of course vary in historical value , but are given for no more than they are worth .

		In referring to the death of the
Regent Murray	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Graham	PERSON	says that '' an old historical legend long attributed the murder ... to
Hamilton	PERSON	of Bothwellhaugh '' -- as if there were any reasonable doubt in the matter , whereas the time , the place , and the manner of the assassina - tion are definitely determined on good evidence , the very weapon with which the deed was done is pre - served , and the red-handed
James Hamilton	PERSON	, noted for such bloody enterprises , stands pretty clearly convicted of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	's untimely taking-off .

		The book is the work of a hand experienced in this sort of collective biography , and shows care and skill in its making , though one error at least -LRB- probably a misprint -RRB- has crept in , by which
Patrick	PERSON	, tenth
Earl of Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	, is made to die three centuries after his time .

		There is abundance of anecdote and other entertaining as well as historically memorable matter in the volume .

		IT - „ i ... ■ ^ ... A volume of Professor Pasquale Final vtewt .

		`` i of a great Villari s '' otudies , Historical and historian .

		Critical , '' translated by the venerable historian 's devoted wife , has been issued by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The first and longest of these seven essays , turning on the question , * ` Is History a Science ? ''

		possesses unusual value , not © nly as a summary of past and current thought on the relation between investigation and literary art , but as coming at the end of a fruitful career from a scholar who has known how to combine the methodical diligence of the Germans with certain more gracious qualities of sentiment and style which now seem to be the prop - erty of the Italians even more than of the French .

		To this greatest of living historians , the amassing and ordering of minute detail , and the whole rational procedure of scholarship , are nothing if they do not contribute to the advancement of an ideal and an art of human life .

		As with the purely rational element in historical investigation , so with a mere political faith : this '' can not suffice to consolidate the existence of a free and civUized people unless it be sustained by a nobler human ideal .

		Wherefore , the chief aim of our literature and science should be to revive this ideal in the heart of our nation . ''

		Of the other six essays -- on
Cavour	PERSON	,
Settembrini	PERSON	,
DeSanctis	PERSON	,
Morelli	PERSON	,
Donatello	ORGANIZATION	, and
Savonarola	LOCATION	-- possibly the most inspiring is that on
DeSanctis	PERSON	, since it is a subtle and loving analysis of the method and achievement of Professor
Villari	PERSON	's own teacher , in the light of more recent tendencies among students and critics of literature and the other fine arts .

		However , it is unfair to single out any one of the seven essays , as if all of them were not character - ized by delicacy of touch , richness of allusion , strength of perspective , and a crowning philosophy in which the activities of the historian , critic , edu - cator , and patriotic statesman are made one .

		The illustrations , beginning with a photogravure of the author and including one of
DeSanctis	ORGANIZATION	, deserve special mention .

		___ ^ Some German ^ ix years before his death in
1879	DATE	, utters for
Johannes Brahms	PERSON	sent to his pub - music-ivvers .

		ligher a document which he called his last will and testament , wherein he gave direc - tions that all letters found in his house were to be destroyed .

		But when his executor took charge of his effects , it was decided that the so-called will was too hastily and informally drafted to be legally valid , and that it had probably been written in a moment of irritation and was not to be interpreted literally .

		Accordingly there was rescued the budget of letters from
Heinrich	PERSON	and
Elisabet von Herzogenberg	PERSON	, and they , with
Brahms	PERSON	's letters to these warm friends of his , were edited and published .

		An English version of the correspondence , entitled ``
Johannes Brahms	PERSON	: The Herzogenberg Correspondence '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , is now issued ; the translator , whose work seems to be very carefully done , being Miss
Hannah Bryant	PERSON	.

		The musical experiences and compositions , the professional ideals and aspirations , of the three writers of these letters are the favorite topics dis - cussed by them , with all sorts of variations and with the occasional introduction of homelier themes .

		The friendship between the bachelor composer and the
Herzogenbergs	PERSON	was intimate and beautiful .

		Brahms writes , in a letter to
Heinrich	PERSON	on the death of his wife , near the end of the volume : '' You know how unutterably I myself suffer by the loss of your beloved wife , ... It would do me so much good just to sit beside you quietly , press your hand , and share your thoughts of the dear marvellous woman . ''

		A portrait of
Brahms	ORGANIZATION	precedes the letters , and abundant footnotes clear up all perplexities in the text .

		The course of ^ ^ ' Lawrence Oilman belongs to the operatic art class of musical critics and essayists since
Wagner	PERSON	.

		capable of dissecting what might be called the anatomy of music .

		He points out that since
Richard Wagner	PERSON	ceased to be a dynamic fig - ure in the life of the world , the history of operatic art has been , save for a few conspicuous exceptions , a barren and improfitable page .

		In '' Aspects of Modern Music '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	gives us , with uncommon discrimination and power of analysis , chapters on the Wagnerian aftermath , a view of
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	, the art and morals of
Strauss	PERSON	's `` Salome , '' and his conception of a perfect music drama .

		The author 's views and opinions are care - fully formed though sometimes radical in expression .

		He pronounces Debussy 's '' Pelleas et Melisande '' a masterly piece of psychological and subliminal delineation , and believes that there is nothing in
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 contemporaneous musical art which in the remotest degree resembles it in impulse or character . ''

		That , as an example of the ideal welding of drama and music , it will exert a formative or suggestive influ - ence , it is not now possible to say ; but that its extraordinary importance as a work of art will compel an ever-widening appreciation seems to many certain and indisputable .

		Thinking of this score ,
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	might justly say , with
Coventry Pat	ORGANIZATION	- more , ' I have respected posterity . ' ''

		Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	's book is well worth reading , as it contains matter that will awaken new thoughts and stimulate dis - cussion on musical themes .

		The honorable 9 ° ® does not associate genealogical ancestry of investigations with
Abraham Lm	PERSON	-
Lincoin	PERSON	.

		^ q ^ q . -RSB-

		^ jg genius has always stood as typical of the democratic ideal , which makes no account of ancestors and moulds the most discourag - ing environment to its own ends .

		But with the centenary appears an admirer of the great American who believes firmly in hereditary genius , resents the slurs that have been put upon Lincoln 's family , par - ticularly upon his father and mother , and who has pursued his favorite occupation of record-hunting in this country and
England	LOCATION	to the end of showing that the Lincolns occupied an honorable position in both countries . ''

		The Ancestry of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	'' is the title of Mr.
J. Henry Lea	PERSON	's book .

		In the investigations conducted in
England	LOCATION	he had the assistance of Mr.
J. R. Hutchinson	PERSON	, who is acknow - ledged on the title-page as joint author .

		The
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the work in the form of a large octavo , with elegance of typography and binding , and many interesting illustrations repro - duced in photogravure .

		Mr.
Lea	PERSON	's conclusions are to the effect that the Lincolns of
Hingham	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, were '' ostensible yeomen with a dominant strain of gentle blood in their veins , '' while the Ketts of Wymondham were true patriots , though unfortunate ones , two of them dying in behalf of the common weal .

		In
America	LOCATION	, also , the family can boast many worthy and even distinguished members .

		As for
Thomas Lincoln	PERSON	, he was a good man , though not a great one ; a rover perhaps , but not a thriftless rolling-stone or a '' restless squatter . ''

		He fought a good fight against cruelly heavy odds ; and his honesty , truth , humor , and good-nature were a valuable heritage to his famous son .

		An appendix contains a number of documents , in the original wordings , -- wills , deeds , letters , etc. .

		Altogether Mr.
Lea	PERSON	's contribution is decidedly the most original that the centenary has evoked .

		Old French prints and their charm .

		Collectors or would-be collectors of prints will find Mr.
Ralph Nevill	PERSON	's '' French Prints of the Eighteenth Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- an excellent guide to a little - known division of an art of which almost nothing has been written in English .

		There are two main parts of the book : An account of the lives and work of the great line-engravers and makers of color - prints , with some general suggestions for amateur collectors ; and a catalogue of the most important French engravings of the eighteenth century , grouped under an alphabetical arrangement of artists ' names , and accompanied by brief descriptions , and notes on the various states .

		There are two indexes , one to artists , the other to paintings and engravings ; and fifty full-page plates , illustrating varied and delight - ful examples of the estampe galante , with its pretty portrayal of the dainty , frivolous , eminently deco - rative pastimes and foUies of the old regime .

		The second part of the book is of course for reference ; the first is not too detailed or technical to lack interest for the general reader .

		Mr.
Nevill	PERSON	laments the slight attention paid , outside of
France	LOCATION	, to French prints which , both as art and as a reflection of life , are worthy of serious consideration .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Alexander J	PERSON	,
Philips	ORGANIZATION	is the compiler of `` A
Dickens Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	'' now published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It provides , in a stout volume , an alphabetical index of both the characters and the scenes that appear in the novels and miscellaneous writings of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		The letters are not catalogued , nor is the '' Child 's History of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The compiler expects in course of time to give us a ''
Dickens Encyclopsedia	PERSON	, '' still more comprehensive in its plan than the present work .

		It is much easier to find authorities for the study of the old masters of painting than for the study of modern painters -- those who are Uving and working to-day , or who have but recently left us . ''

		The Art of Painting in the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- is a convenient hand - book prepared by Dr.
Edmund von Mach	PERSON	, recently Instructor of the Fine Arts at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		French , Ger - man , British , and
American Painting	ORGANIZATION	are discussed , each in a separate chapter ;
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
the Netherlands	LOCATION	are classed together in one chapter ;
Russia	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	, and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	in another .

		A book of 170 pages covering so large a field implies that little more than brief sketches of principal names has been possible .

		But the preface warns us not to expect '' art-criticism , nor clever and pithy sayings , '' so we need not be misled .

		There are thirty-two fidl-page illustrations .

		`` Some Notable Altars in the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	'' are pictured in fine quarto-sized plates and briefly described by Rev.
John Wright	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, rector of
St. Paul 's Church	ORGANIZATION	in
St. Paul	LOCATION	, in a handsome volume published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the principal object of the work is to furnish definite information and practical suggestions for the building or enrichment of altars , the descriptions are brief but expUcit ; and wherever possible names of architects and the cost of construction are stated .

		It is only within the
last century	DATE	that the
American Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	has paid much attention to church enrichment , but some beautiful effects have been secured , less pretentious but no less artistic than those of the great old-world
Cathe	PERSON	- drals , and particularly rich in mural paintings .

		The examples illustrated in the present volume exhibit a wide variety in style and in expense , especial effort hav - ing been made to furnish suggestions for moderate priced designs .

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Notes .

		Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, editor of '' The Atlantic Monthly , '' has just been appointed
Hyde Lecturer	ORGANIZATION	at
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	for the academic year 1909-10 .

		Mr.
Perry	PERSON	will discuss American Institutions , but the exact nature of his subject is not yet announced .

		, '' The New Philosophy of Life Series , '' a series of essays by Rev.
J. Herman Randall	PERSON	of
Mount Morris Baptist Church	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, is announced by the
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume of the series , entitled '' The Real God , '' will appear this month .

		An admirable little book for boys and girls who are beginning to take a serious interest in the world around them is Professor
Paul S. Reinsch	PERSON	's `` The Yoimg Citizen 's Reader , '' published by
Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It makes a good school reader , and a good book for young people to read outside of school .

		Mr.
William Young	PERSON	has edited from the -LRB- third -RRB- edition of
1652	DATE	, '' The Saints ' Everlasting Rest , '' by
Richard Baxter	PERSON	.

		Extensive omissions have been made , but the volume is still a stout one , and gives us the substance of this famous religious classic in handsome library form .

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The spring publications of Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	will include a volume of short stories , '' Beyond the Sky Line , '' by ``
Robert Aitken	PERSON	'' ; `` The Marvellous Year , '' a memorial volume of the present year of great cen - tenaries , to which Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	supplies an introduction ; and `` Product and Climax , '' by Mr.
S. N. Patten	PERSON	, a new volume in '' The Art of Life '' series .

		Besides a number of novels , Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	will publish this
Spring	DATE	a two - volume study of '' The Empires of the Far East , '' by Mr.
Lancelot Lawton	PERSON	; '' The Cities of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Royall Tyler	PERSON	; '' ApoUonius of Tyana , '' a study of his life and times , by Dr.
F. W. Groves Campbell	PERSON	; a brief biography of
Rossetti	PERSON	, by Mr.
Frank Rutter	PERSON	; and '' Effective Magazine Advertising , '' by Mr.
Francis Bellamy	PERSON	.

		Through an error , it was recently announced that the biography of the Hon. Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	, to be brought out here by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	, and in
England	LOCATION	by Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	, was the work of `` Miss
Alice Perkins	PERSON	. ''

		It should have been credited to Miss
Jane Perkins	PERSON	, who is a sister-in-law of Professor
Edward Everett Hale , Jr.	PERSON	, the author of '' Dramatists of To-day '' and editor of a number of English classics .

		A new book by Professor
Hugo Munsterberg	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, is announced by
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Eternal Values , '' as it will be called , first appeared last year in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The success of the German edition now leads the author to publish the work in English , not as a mere translation , but with certain side issues omitted , and many new parts added which link it more closely with practical life .

		The
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	publishes a volume of translations , by Mr.
Daniel Joseph Donahoe	PERSON	, of '' Early Christian Hymns , '' including the most famous examples of these compositions from the time of the Fathers down to such men of a later period as
Abelard , Bernard of Clairvaux	ORGANIZATION	,
Bonaventure	LOCATION	,
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, and
Pope Urban VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		This gives us a Christian anthology of great value , the versions being both scholarly and melodious .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish ''
Aiken	PERSON	's
Music Course	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Walter H. Aiken	PERSON	, in a single volume ; '' Nature Study by Grades , '' a teachers ' manual by Mr.
Horace H. Cummings	PERSON	; and `` Essentials in Civil Gov - ernment , '' a book for elementary schools by Dr.
S. E. Forman	PERSON	.

		We can particularly recommend the last - named book , written by the author of the '' Advanced Civics '' which a good many teachers have recently discovered to be the best text-book of the subject that has ever been prepared for use in the American high school .

		The city of
Chelsea	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- , fire-swept a year ago and bereft of its public library , together with other municipal buildings and hundreds of private dwellings , is soon to have a new library building , largely through the generosity of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, who has given
$ 50,000	MONEY	for the purpose .

		Plans have been drawn and accepted for an attractive and , in its internal arrangement , admir - ably convenient and serviceable structure , on which building operations are expected to begin immediately .

		The American publishing rights for General
Kuro	PERSON	- patkin 's `` Military Memoirs '' have been secured by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who will issue the work almost immediately .

		In the Memoirs , General
Kuro	PERSON	- patkin frankly discusser the policies which led up to the Russo-Japanese War , and gives a full account of the conflict .

		The English version of the book is by Captain
A. B. Lindsay	PERSON	, translator of
Nojine	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Truth about Port
Arthur	PERSON	, '' and it is edited by Major
E. S. Swinton	PERSON	, D.S.O.
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's posthumous works , as we learn from the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation , '' are now in the printers ' hands , and are announced to appear within the next few months .

		The volumes will undoubtedly throw a new and clearer light upon many Ibsen problems .

		They will , we under - stand , prove the futility of much speculation and criti - cism , at which
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	himself often smiled as being too subtle and far-fetched .

		The contents include first drafts of many of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's works , and thus show the original keynote from which he started .

		The one hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	occurs on
August 29	DATE	next , but it will be celebrated by a memorial meeting in
Sanders Thea	ORGANIZATION	- tre ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, on
Tuesday	DATE
evening	TIME	,
April 27	DATE	.

		President
Eliot	PERSON	will preside , and brief addresses will be delivered by Dr.
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	of
Concord	LOCATION	, Col.
Thomas W. Higginson	PERSON	, Dr.
David W. Cheever	PERSON	, and the Rev.
Samuel M. Crothers	PERSON	.

		Music will be furnished by the
Harvard Glee Club	ORGANIZATION	and the orchestra of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Latin school .

		Mr.
Charles Townsend	PERSON	Cope - land will read two of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's poems , -- '' The Last Leaf '' and '' The Chambered Nautilus . ''

		The meeting will be under the auspices of the
Cambridge Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and among the invited guests will be the grad - uates of the
Harvard Medical School	ORGANIZATION	between
1847	DATE	and
1882	DATE	.


Sturgis & Walton Company	ORGANIZATION	is the style of a new publishing firm which has just been established in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The members of the firm are

Edward Bulwer-Lytton	PERSON	, which has been out of print for many years ; a new edition of
Charles Waterton	PERSON	's
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 236 '' Wanderings in

Christopher Marlowe	PERSON	's '' Doctor Faustus , ''
John Webster	PERSON	's '' Duchess of Malfi , '' Gold - smith 's '' She
Stoops	PERSON	to Conquer , '' and others equally important , which will contain sufficient critical matter to make them of interest to the general reader and also suitable for class use ; '' The Deepwater Series , '' popular tales of the sea , including classics like `` Two Years before the Mast '' by
Richard Henry Dana , Jr.	PERSON	, '' The Red Rover '' by
J. Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, '' The Wreck of the Grosvenor '' by

Borderland of Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	In this book are covered those points in normal and abnormal Psychology that are vital for the student of Psy - chical Research to know in order that he may judge the abnormal and the supernormal intelligently .

		The book contains chapters on Normal Sense - Perception , Interpreting and

		It treats perplexing questions conserv - atively , and with a view to create an intelli - gent public interest in the baffling problem of psychical research .

		It is a book none should neglect who is attracted by the recondite mystery to whose solution it looks forward and attempts to clear the way . ''

		-- The Outlook .

		Enigmas of Psychical Research An account of the scientific invest - igation and consideration of such well-established phenomena as crystal - gazing , telepathy , dreams , apparitions , premonitions , clairvoyance , medium - istic phenomena , etc. . ''

		Professor
Hyslop	PERSON	, be it observed , does not write as one who has fully made up his mind , and ia determined to make others see with his eyes .

		On the contrary , he is care - ful to preserve an attitude of caution , the attitude , in short , of the trained investi - gator who feels that the end is not yet in sight .

		Perhaps this , more than anything else , is responsible for the praise his book has elicited . ''

		Science and a Future Life In this volume the author discusses the scientific investigation of psychic phenomena . ''

		Professor
Hyslop	PERSON	discusses the problem of life after death from data accumulated by the

		He considers the evidence scientifically , basing his argument upon experiments conducted by Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	, the late Professor
Henry Sidgwick	PERSON	, Professor
James	PERSON	, of Har - vard , the late
Frederic W. H. Myers	PERSON	, and a number of others , including some valu - able experimental work of his own . ''

		-- Review of Reviews . ''

		His argument is like the charge of a judge to a jury , clear , definite , logical , leaving no doubtful point untouched , and no interrogation unanswered .

		Altogether the book is one of the most important in its particular branch of literature that has ever yet been given to the public .

		It should have a multitude of readers . ''

		Every one knows that , while there is a residuum of the genuine , there is undoubtedly an im - mense amount of fraud perpetrated on credulous investigators of psychic phenomena .

		With rare skill and tact Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	, who has had many years of experience , shows exactly how the tricks are done .

		His book is written wholly without prejudice , in a calm , courteous , judicial style , and the facts are presented with precision and order - liness .

		The latter part of the book is devoted to the consideration of what the author believes to be genuine phe - nomena . ''

		He writes from the point of view of one who believes that such phenomena as come within the realms of spiritualism , popularly conceived , do occur , and on that account he is particularly anxious to expose the fraud connected with them , since it is only by so doing that the world can reach the genuine which

$ 1.62	MONEY	.

		This book fills a place in the literature of psychical research not covered by any other book that has thus far ap - peared .

		Its aim is threefold : -LRB- 1 -RRB- To form an introduction to the study of the subject , so that any one may feel familiar with the general problems and results without having previously read extensively upon it ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to approach the baffling questions from the stand - point of physical science , and point out exactly what the difficulties and objections are to the scientific man ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- to summarize the various explana - tory theories that have been advanced from time to time to explain the facts of psychical research . ''

		The great importance of the book lies in its pointing out that materialism must ultimately triumph , if no facts can be brought forward to prove it erroneous , and this would mean the destruction of the religious consciousness of the age .

		It is of prime importance , therefore , that the ' average reader , ' if there is such a thing , should be properly introduced to the prob - lems of ' the coming science . ' ''

		NOTES 268 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 269 HOME R ULE AN D PUB LIC ED UCA TION .

		From the time when the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	ordered that a com - mon school should be established in every town of fifty householders , at the expense of those house - holders , and fixed a penalty for non-compliance with this law , it has been the recognized duty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to see that the means of education are provided for its youthful citizens , and to make it impossible for any miserly or short - sighted local community to withhold the needed financial support .

		No principle is more firmly fixed in our practice than this , and none is more fundamental to our existence as a
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	of free democratic commonwealths .

		The advancing years have witnessed an extension of this principle undreamed of by the pioneers who first gave it a legal phrasing , but the embryo of all that we have grown into educationally is found in the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	law above men - tioned .

		Education is the function of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, not of the county or town , because it is a matter too essential to the common welfare to be left to the caprice of the locality .

		The small com - munity may cut its coat according to its cloth in such matters of local concern as police and fire protection , road-making and street-paving , drainage and sanitation , because the neglect of these things has consequences which , however disastrous , are confined to a limited area ; but a failure to provide suitable public education has effects so far-reaching that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is bound to interpose , and to assert its paramount interest in the training of its future citizens .

		This principle once granted -LRB- and we all grant it in the abstract -RRB- , questions of the degree and kind of education become questions of the merest detail .

		Whatever system of public edu - cation the consensus of
State	ORGANIZATION	opinion determines upon must be accepted , and in good faith pro- vided for , by the local political units of which the
State	ORGANIZATION	consists .

		If it range from the lowest elementary teaching to the highest university training , no section has a right to refuse its share of the burden .

		We used to hear much of the foolish argument that the local commu - nity , while bound to provide common schools , might or might not provide high schools at its own pleasure , as if this decision involved some fundamental principle , instead of being a minor aspect of the general question of
State	ORGANIZATION	policy .

		248 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , We hear little of that contention of late years , because it is too logically evident that manda - tory support of common schools and of a
State	ORGANIZATION	university makes provision for the intermediate period of education equally mandatory .

		But we still have many examples of local communities which , from motives of economy , sheltering themselves under the specious demand for home rule in educational affairs , seek to evade their fuU educational obligations .

		The principle of home rule is a sound one in all matters that concern local interests alone ; in its relation to education , its legitimate sphere is strictly admin - istrative , and it must not be permitted to hamper the declared policy of the commonwealth .

		These considerations need particularly to be urged at the present time , because in the two largest cities of the country there are now in progress powerfully supported movements to make a most injurious application of the prin - ciple of home rule to school affairs .

		In both
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, the attempt is being made to withdraw from the city schools the fimdamental safeguards which the
State	ORGANIZATION	has wisely established for the protection of public education against the ignorance or caprice of local politicians .

		In each case , the attempt is concealed in a plan for a new city charter , and is likely to escape the attention it should receive from the public because of the multiplicity of other matters with which it is associated .

		An issue of the first importance is thus in danger of being so befogged that serious mischief may be done before the public becomes aware that mischief is designed .

		The situation in
New York City	LOCATION	may be briefly outlined .

		About ten years ago , a benefi - cent piece of legislation , known as the
Davis	PERSON	law , was enacted at
Albany	LOCATION	.

		Its provisions assured the teachers of the metropolis , for the first time in their history , of adequate compen - sation , secure tenure , and suitable allowances after retirement .

		It transformed as by magic the whole educational situation , gave stability to the teaching profession , improved its morale ^ and inaugurated a new era of efficiency .

		The unspeakable demoralization of the former sys - tem of local control was done away with ; the unrest of the past became an old , unhappy , far - off thing , and the members of the teaching force , no longer compelled to intrigue for retention or deserved promotion , no longer uncertain of what the coming year might bring forth for them out of the witch 's cauldron of Tammany politics , were free to devote themselves to the legitimate duties of their profession .

		The wisdom of the
Davis	PERSON	law has been so abundantly justified by its effects that it would seem as if no rational person could desire its abrogation ; yet at the present time a
Charter Commission	ORGANIZATION	is doing its best to secure repeal , and to restore to the
Board of Estimate	ORGANIZATION	its former power to determine from year to year , as the exigencies of local politics may dictate , the conditions of the teacher 's existence in the public schools of the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The present situation in
Chicago	LOCATION	is essentially the same , although the
State	ORGANIZATION	safeguards , which it is now sought to remove , are of a widely dif - ferent nature .

		In
Illinois	LOCATION	, these safeguards take the form , not of guaranteed minimum rates of compensation for individuals , but of a guar - anteed minimum of the total appropriation for the purposes of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools .

		Under the existing law , which is of many years ' standing , a fixed percentage of the tax levy must be applied to educational purposes .

		The amount realized may go up or down with the annual assessment of taxable property , but the share is secured by law , and no part of it may be diverted to any other use .

		Without going into the details of a very complicated matter , we may say -- and it is sufficient for our present purpose of making the situation clear -- that the city
Board of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion has a right , for current educational expenses -LRB- exclusive of the erection of school buildings -RRB- to
five dollars	MONEY	for every four dollars that may be applied to the other purposes of city government from the annual tax levy .

		In order that this ratio may be properly understood , we must add that the city gets , from licenses and other sources outside the tax levy , approximately
four dollars	MONEY	more in which the schools have no share .

		It may enlarge its special revenues indefinitely by various forms of indirect taxation , but it can not intrench upon the educational fund .

		As a matter of form , the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	makes the educational appropriation , which may be reduced if it wish , but since it can not itself benefit by such a reduc - tion , and since the full amount authorized by law is inadequate for the needs of the schools , this power of reduction is never exercised .

		Two years ago a new city charter was adopted by the
Illinois Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, but overwhelmingly rejected by a referendum vote .

		This charter gave the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	full control over the appor - tionment of funds , and placed the
Board of Edu	ORGANIZATION	- cation completely at its mercy .

		This , pro vision was one of the chief reasons for the defeat of the proposed instrument of municipal govern - ment , and yet , with amazing fatuity , a charter embodying the same vicious principle is now again submitted to the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	and will very
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 likely again come before the voters .

		However great its merits in other respects , such a charter must be resolutely opposed by all the friends of public education .

		To put the schools at the mercy of the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	, to remove from them the existing legislative safeguards respecting their share of the tax levy , would be to deal them the severest blow conceivable .

		No col - lateral benefits to other departments of the city government could outweigh or offset this evil .

		There can be no doubt whatever as to how the plan would work .

		The demands of the city government are insatiable , and the pressure exerted to enlarge the police force or the fire department , to increase the appropriations for the cleaning and the paving of streets , all of which things , and others , might so easily be done at the expense of the schools , would prove irresistible .

		Every year would witness a relative shrinking of the school fund , and a consequent retardation of educational development .

		There has not been a single year of the last twenty in which the
Council	ORGANIZATION	would not have done this very thing had it possessed the legal power , in which it has not cast longing eyes at the school revenue lying so temptingly just beyond its reach .

		To give it , as the proposed charter contemplates , this long-coveted power would be the extreme of unwisdom .

		We think it necessary to sound this note of alarm because the matter has been intentionally obscured by the sponsors of the pending charter legislation .

		They say a great deal about the importance of a unified administrative system and the consolidation of our local governments , and carefully refrain from explaining how radi - cally their plan would affect the public schools .

		When the point is pressed upon them , they talk airily of increased revenues in which all depart - ments would share , and affect injured surprise at the suggestion that the schools might not be generously dealt with .

		But the bird which our city education now has in the hand is worth sev - eral of the elusive songsters that maybe imagined to lurk in the bush of the proposed charter .

		Whatever happens , the friends of our school system must insist upon retaining the present provision of a fixed fraction for school purposes , or , if this be not granted them , must reject , regretfully but firmly , the entire measure which would otherwise prove their undoing .

		We have no fear of the outcome if this vital matter can be brought squarely before the public eye , but we confess to no little fear lest the case go against the schools by default of that alert interest in their welfare which is now so imperatively needed .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The disparagement of current literature , as compared with the literature of a more fortunate earlier time , seems to be as inevitable as teething in children or rheumatism in old age .

		In looking back at the early and middle Victorian era , when
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	were beginning to be known , and many lesser lights spangled the literary firmament , we are not wont to consider it an age devoid of illumination .

		And yet , opening ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' which appeared in the
autumn of 1847	DATE	, we find in the thirty-second chapter an almost tearfully regretful mention of the good old times .

		St.
John Rivers	ORGANIZATION	had just brought
Jane	PERSON	a copy of `` Marmion '' -- `` one of those genuine productions so often vouch - safed to the fortunate public of those days -- the golden age of modern literature , '' comments the writer , and then continues : '' Alas !

		the readers of our era are less favoured .

		But courage !

		I will not pause either to accuse or repine .

		I know poetry is not dead , nor genius lost ; nor has Mammon gained power over either , to bind or slay : they will both assert their existence , their presence , their liberty and strength again one day . ''

		Curious indeed is it to observe how the same old mental attitudes , -- despair of the present , backward glances of mourn - ful regret at the past , and -LRB- though less invariably -RRB- hope of better things to come , -- are assumed by one generation after another , with a naive unconscious - ness that there is nothing novel and nothing excep - tional in the situation .

		But of such old stories ever new is human experience composed .

		* • • • French literary criticism has long been re - garded by other nations as a model in its kind .

		Of more than local interest , therefore , is the series of four public lectures delivered in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in con - nection with his longer course to students , by Pro- fessor
Abel Lefranc	PERSON	, this year 's
Hyde	LOCATION	lecturer at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his opening address he touched upon the three chief features of what he called the new or historical method in literary criticism .

		First , it seeks to reconstruct the circumstances in which a work of literature was produced ; second , it studies sources and takes note of imitations ; and '' the third feature of the historical method is the search for real personal elements in the great writers .

		All works have been questioned as to their authors , and very few of the works have been mute .

		Whether it be d'Urf ^ , or Montaigne , or Rabelais , or Villon , or Ronsard , or
Boileau	PERSON	, or the
Abb	ORGANIZATION	^ Provost , some por - tion of the heart and soul has found a lodgement in the work .

		This questioning of the works for confi - dences , for indiscretions , it may be , about their authors , is only an expression of a taste and a pas - sion for truth ... We are tending to isolate lit - erature less and less from life and reality ; as we connect them closer , and as we study literature more intelligently from this viewpoint , our literature grows in greatness in our eyes . ''

		This '' third feature '' 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, might well have heen treated as first and foremost .

		If we take from the works of an author that which is distinctive and personal , how little of human interest and real importance remains !

		• • • A county 's growth in the love of literature is remarkably illustrated by the literary awakening that has taken place within the
last three years	DATE	in
Multnomah County	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		The
Portland Library Association	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- or public library , as it might better style itself -RRB- prints in its forty-fifth annual report some figures that reveal a hopeful state of affairs in that far-off corner of our great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Asso - ciation , supported by city and county alike , supplies reading matter to the farmer and the merchant , to the wood-hewer and the banker , without distinction of person .

		The librarian takes pleasure in announc - ing that this county work has passed its experimental stage , and now '' it is no longer a question of devising ways to advertise the Library or to make its books attractive , but rather one of how to satisfy the clamor for more books .

		In
1905	DATE	, the first year of county work , the circulation of books was 3,955 , in
1906	DATE	it grew to 13,358 , in
1907	DATE	to 37,521 , and in
1908	DATE	, still maintaining its rate of growth , it reached 58,169 . ''

		Seven reading-rooms , fourteen deposit stations , and nine fire companies -LRB- the last item is a little perplexing to a stranger -RRB- are scattered through - out the county .

		This rural activity , controlled by a central library , has interested us and others of late ; and it promises to produce excellent results in the more thinly populated sections of the country .

		The county library 's usefulness in creating a demand for books would seem to be not inferior to the service it renders in supplying that demand .

		• • • The literature of the linotype , the machine whose general introduction fifteen years ago was momentous to the newspaper-printing industry , has increased in vogue within that comparatively short period to an astonishing extent .

		In
1894	DATE	, as we learn from a late issue of '' Printers ' Ink , '' there was consumed in the newspaper trade of this country an amount of paper weighing four hundred thousand tons , and only thirteen years later the figures had risen to thrice that annual tonnage .

		The daily news - papers increased from
1855	DATE	in number sixteen years ago to
2374 last year	DATE	, with a considerable gain also in weeklies .

		The discontinuing of the wetting pro- cess preparatory to printing -LRB- we no longer dry our morning paper over the register -RRB- is another of the mechanical improvements that marked the adoption of the labor-saving linotype , while methods and ideals have undergone no less a transformation in the editorial and administrative departments .

		Is it surprising , with all these acres of more or less irre - sistibly attractive printed matter clamoring every morning to be bought at prices ranging from a quarter to half a cent per square yard , that the Amer - ican bookstore is not quite so conspicuous a feature of the urban landscape as , for instance , the saloon , the cigar shop , and the ice-cream establishment ?

		Menander on a modern stage constituted an event at
Cambridge	LOCATION	that was unique in the literal sense of that much misused adjective .

		`` The Epitrepontes , '' the most considerable of the Men - ander fragments unearthed in
Egypt	LOCATION	four years ago by
M. Gustave Lefebvre	PERSON	, was successfully staged and acted last month by the
Classical Club of Har	ORGANIZATION	- vard .

		Perhaps one should not say '' staged , '' how - ever , for the play was presented in a private house with a truly Greek simplicity in the matter of '' properties '' -- with little , in fact , to hinder the imagination from transferring the scene to the prim - itive classic theatre of twenty-two centuries ago .

		The comedy itself is , of course , one of domestic intrigue , and seeks to amuse by the sprightliness of the dialogue in which the rather hackneyed plot is developed .

		Enough of the original remains -- 532 lines -- to render the play intelligible and enjoyable ; and the Greek depai ` tment of
the University	ORGANIZATION	was unsparing in its efforts to do the great comedy - writer justice .

		A small chorus executed the ele - mentary dancing required , to the music composed for flutes by the late Professor
Allen	PERSON	on the occa - sion of a Terence performance some years ago , and the ten actors acquitted themselves well .

		Plautus and
Terence	PERSON	are no strangers to the modern stage ; but Menander , their master and model , is '' now revived for the first time after his slumber of centuries .

		• • • The activity of the
Atlanta Library	LOCATION	, which , by the way , is one of the numerous
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	libra - ries that shed their blessings on the just and on the unjust alike throughout our favored land , is strik - ingly illustrated by a few facts gleaned from the librarian 's tenth annual report .

		For example , the circulation has increased more rapidly in the last twelve months than in any previous year , being 32,350 over that of
1907	DATE	, and amounting to 164,600 in all .

		A rent collection , to appease the clamor for new fiction , was installed on the
first day of June	DATE	, and 699 volumes had been bought at the close of the year , at a cost of
$ 585.54	MONEY	.

		These volumes circu - lated 11,273 times , and the rent fee -LRB- one cent a day -RRB- exactly equalled in its total the amount spent in pur - chasing the books -- a triumph in the fine art of making an institution exactly self-supporting , with neither surplus nor deficiency -LRB- unless this remark - able and beautiful coincidence is an error of the types -RRB- .

		The year
1908	DATE	was the first year of a new librarian ,
Miss Julia T. Rankin	PERSON	; and it is safe -LRB- as well as complimentary to her -RRB- to infer that no small part of the library 's increased usefulness is attribut - able to the energy and wisdom of the new adminis - tration ... • Honor among public library patrons ought to be a matter of course ; they ought to respect one another 's rights .

		The old phrase , `` honor among thieves , '' implies this mutual consideration in a much lower social stratum .

		Unregistered borrow - ings and law-forbidden mutilations are acts that sorely try the patience -LRB- to put it mildly -RRB- of a whole
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 community .

		In process of time , it may be hoped , there will be developed so universal and deeply - planted a sense of the entire unfitness of such out - rages on the public that no person , with a grain of self-respect , will dream of violating the wholesome and necessary rules of the hospitably open free library , any more than one would now dream of poisoning a public well or wantonly vitiating the air of heaven .

		Encouraging in this connection is an announcement in the current report of the
John Crerar	PERSON	Library that whereas in
1907	DATE	twenty-one books were lost from the open shelves of its reading - room , in
1908	DATE	only eight such losses were noted .

		Presumably , too , the use of the room was greater in the latter year , and perhaps also the number of books exposed .

		Let us make the most of all such signs of increasing honor and enlightenment .

		• • • A YOUTHFULLY ACTIVE VETERAN OF LETTERS , whom his many jnniors and few contemporaries can - not but behold with admiration , as well as respect , and whom we have before paid tribute to in these columns , sets forth on the European tour , in his ninety-second year , apparently with all the zest and expectancy of a stripling , and with far more likeli - hood of turning his foreign experiences to good account , both for himself and for the world at large .

		Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	departed for
France	LOCATION	last month to indulge once more his old and cultivated fondness for '' doing
Europe	LOCATION	'' -- or at least some small part of it .

		Whether , on his return , he will have some - thing new to tell us about
Franklin	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	, or some other contribution to make to biography or history , will appear in the sequel .

		Not even the elder
Cato	ORGANIZATION	, with his octogenarian zeal for new enter - prises -- including the learning of Greek and the -LRB- less laudable -RRB- instigation of the third Punic war -- and not even Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	, with his greatest liter - ary work executed in his nineties , are more worthy of admiration and emulation from the youngsters of seventy and under .

		, , , A RUBBISH-HEAP OF READING MATTER that no one has ever read or ever will read goes on piling itself up in
Washington	LOCATION	at a fearful rate .

		A com - mittee of investigation has found nine thousand five hundred tons of accumulated government publica - tions stored away at a cost of thousands of dollars yearly for storage .

		A railway freight train loaded with these useless volumes would extend some three miles in length .

		Is there another country in the world that prints so many unspoken speeches and unimportant reports ?

		It is significant that the terms of the recent pension bill allow the pension printing to be done by private contract , this being more economical -- less lavishly uneconomical , rather -- than government printing .

		Curious and deplorable is it that while millions perish of hunger in
India	LOCATION	, and other millions undergo intellectual starvation the world over , this free and enlightened country spends
millions of dollars	MONEY	in printing and illustrating and binding and storing books that nobody needs .

		No one approves this foolish expenditure -- except per - haps the recipients of the money spent , and probably not even these recipients in their lucid and honest moments .

		... The ACUMEN of an English critic displays itself to the reader 's wonderment in a recent review of President
Eliot	PERSON	's ``
University Administration	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The reviewer , whose article appears in one of the foremost
London	LOCATION	literary weeklies , gravely discusses the book as if it were from the pen of a hitherto unknown writer , a new light in the educational world , and one that it has been reserved to the reviewer to make known to the public ; and for the further instruction of that public the conjecture is hazarded that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	is '' presumably an Ameri - can . ''

		Verily , the Dutch have taken
Holland	LOCATION	.

		Had it but been possible for Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	to gratify the desire of his fellow-countrymen by accepting the English ambassadorship , our
London	LOCATION	reviewer might , by some lucky chance , have discovered that his conjec - ture was correct .

		As it is , he is likely to go to his grave with no more definite knowledge of one
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	than that he is `` presumably an American . ''

		, , , A STRENUOUS LIBRARIAN -LRB- for such there are in the library-world -RRB- is lost to us in the death of Dr.
James H. Canfield	PERSON	, for many years prominent in the educational and especially the college world , and for the last ten years at the head of the
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Library .

		For robust vigor and personal force few librarians are to be compared with him .

		Those who have ever seen him on the speakers ' plat - form or met him in personal intercourse will retain this impression of abounding vitality .

		We remember the applause of mirth and approval that greeted one of his utterances before a university graduating class some years ago , when he assured the young hopefuls before him that if they wished to succeed in life it must be quite as much by perspiration as by aspiration ; and he mopped his steaming brow as the sun poured in on him that hot
June	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		It was he , by the way , who proposed , not long ago , a plan that might be called the syndicating of our public libraries for their mutual benefit and the advantage of the public -- a scheme that , not wholly to our regret , still slumbers in the embryo .

		• • •
George Herbert	PERSON	, as the originator of Fletcherism , under another name , is doubtless less well-known than

		COMMUNIGA TIONS .

		COPYRIGHT AND THE IMPORTATION PRIVILEGE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In the summary presented in the
April 1	DATE	number of The Dial of the changes in the copyright law that will go into effect under the new statute , the opinion is expressed that the privilege of importing , irrespective of the permission of the owner of the copyright , copies of books which have secured copyright in the
United States	LOCATION	should not be restricted to libraries , associations , and individuals , as is the case under the new statute , but should be extended also to booksellers .

		The provision as it now stands concedes practically to all the citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	, excepting only booksellers , the privilege of being placed outside of the ordinary and logical restrictions of copyright law .

		If your view of the matter should have prevailed , or if , with any future reshaping of the law , such an exten - sion might be brought into force , there might well be question as to the character or the value of the property that came into the hands of the publisher who made purchase , from the producer , of an American copyright .

		The privilege of importing , irrespective of the per - mission of the owner of the copyright , foreign editions of books that have secured American copyright , is of course entirely inconsistent with the principle and prac - tice of copyright law .

		In no coimtry other than the
United States	LOCATION	has the attempt ever been made thus to restrict and imdennine the value of copyright property .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, the sevei-al copyright statutes that had been in force prior to
1891	DATE	were consistent in this matter of securing for the owner of the copyright , and for his assign , the exclusive control of the book or other article copyrighted .

		The provision in the existing law -LRB- which has been copied into the new statute -RRB- under which the privilege of importing such copyrighted books , irrespective of the permission of the owner or of the assign , is accorded practically to everybody who is not a bookseller , was interpolated into the act of
1891	DATE	during the last hours of the session .

		The law of
1891	DATE	had been the subject of discussion for a period of five years .

		At no time during those discussions was any suggestion made that in conceding , under reciprocity provisions , copyright to authors who were citizens or residents of other states , those authors should not be placed in a position to transfer to their assign , the American publisher , the full control of a copyrighted work .

		Under present conditions , when an American pub - lisher divides with an English publisher a publication originating in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, or a series of an interna - tional character contributions for which are secured from all parts of the world , the English publisher obtains , under the British law and under tlie provisions of the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	, the full control and advan - tage of the editions brought into print by himself , for
Great Britain	LOCATION	, for the British Empire , and for
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He also secures , under the inconsistent provisions of the American law , the right to distribute copies of his edi - tions throughout the
United States	LOCATION	, a right of which he is naturally availing himself to an increasing extent from year to year .

		The American publisher , on the other hand , is entirely excluded from
Great Britain	LOCATION	and from
Europe	LOCATION	, and secures in his own market not the exclusive control , which is the theory of copyright law , but simply the privilege of selling in competition with the English publisher .

		Such an operation of the law works injustice and , ne - cessarily , discourages international publishing arrange - ments and joint publishing undertakings .

		It constitutes what might be called '' boomerang '' protection , -- that is to say , it is a specific advantage given by American law to a foreign competitor .

		The American publisher does not ask for any special privileges .

		He does ask , and he has a right to secure , under any civilized system of copyright , the control of the property that he purchases and in which he is called upon to make investment .

		The American reading pub - lic has , apart from the matter of doing justice to the American publisher , a direct interest in securing an equitable and consistent copyright law .

		It is important for the literary and higher educational interests of the country , and for the requirements of American book - buyers , that the business of producing American editions of books originating abroad , shall be encouraged .

		It is also important for the same interests that the business should be encouraged of bringing into publication inter - national series the contributions for which shall be secured from all parts of the world .

		The American reader is entitled to the best that there is in the matter of science or literature .

		This can be secured only if the production of American editions of international series can be furthered .

		Under existing conditions , the publication of such series and of American editions of transatlantic books is , of necessity , discouraged .

		1 may give as an example the ''
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature . ''

		The publishers are called upon to make in the production of tlie American edition of this work an investment that will amount to some thirty thousand dollars .

		The work , from its compass and character , must depend for its chief demand upon libraries , or upon the wealthier of individual buyers , those who are likely to have connections and accounts on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		A large portion , and an increasing portion , however , of the American demand for this set is being supplied , through
London	LOCATION	purchasing agents , with copies of the English issue .

		This is not because the English issue is more attractively printed , for the typography of the American volume is more satisfactory .

		The difference in price is but trifling .

		The librarians , however , who have standing arrangements with purchasing agents in
London	LOCATION	, find it an inconvenience to instruct these agents to except from their shipments books which are being produced in copyrighted American editions , while the purchasing agent is , naturally , interested in making his shipments as large as possible .

		As a result of such standing in - structions , it is frequently the case that the American librarian purchases the English edition of a work at a considerably higher price than he would pay for an American edition equally attractive in form , and often better suited for the needs of the American market .

		It is , however , quite in order that in the cases in which
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 a purchaser , whether a librarian or an individual buyer , prefers the transatlantic to the American edition , he should be placed in the position to secure such trans - atlantic issue .

		Under the American law back of
1891	DATE	, there was no difficulty , and under the present English statute , there is no difficulty , in importing , under the per - mission of the ovoner of the copyright , copies of the trans - atlantic edition .

		Such an order can be placed either directly with the publisher controlling the copyright , or with any intelligent bookseller , whose importation is then made through the publisher .

		Such an arrange - ment would meet your suggestion that a customer who may not have a transatlantic account should be placed in a position to purchase , through a bookseller , a copy of the English issue , securing the same privilege that is accorded to the individual who happens to possess an accoimt in
London	LOCATION	.

		The only requirement made under a consistent and equitable copyright law is that the importation must be made through the publisher to whom has been assigned the American copyright .

		There is no little confusion in the mind of the public generally , and of their representatives the legislators , in regard to this matter of a consistent and equitable copyright , a copyright that shall carry out the expressed purpose of copyright law , -- the furthering of literary production .

		Those who are interested in the work of bringing the
United States	LOCATION	in this matter of copyright into line with the other civilized states of the world , are naturally anxious that the influence of a journal like The Dial should not be given to furthering a confused under - standing of the nature of copyright or of the actual work - ing of copyright law with reference to the interests not only of authors and of publishers , but of the book-buying community .

		As an appendix to this communication I quote an opinion that has come to me from Mr.
L. E. Scaife	PERSON	, one of the leaders of the Suffolk Bar -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- in regard to the right on the part of the owner of a copyright , or of an assign , under the English and American statutes , to control the matter of importations of the copyrighted article .

		`` Since the year
1710	DATE	, nobody but the owner of the English copyright of book has had the right to import into
England	LOCATION	such copyrighted book without the written consent of such owner ; and from
1790	DATE	down to the passage of the
United States Statute	ORGANIZATION	, of
1891	DATE	, nobody but the owner of the
United States Copy	LOCATION	- right of a book had the right to import into the
United States	LOCATION	such copyrighted book without the consent of the owner .

		The
United States	LOCATION	law concerning importation was so clearly adapted from the English statute of
1710	DATE	that the English decisions have of necessity been given great weight in the American courts ... The provisions of the act of
March 3rd , 1891	DATE	, ought to be inter - preted in connection with the entire history of the copyright law of the world . ''

		THE COST OF CIRCULATING A LIBRARY BOOK .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The extent of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	's circle of readers would seem to justify some comment on your recent remarks , even assuming that they were '' writ sarcastic , '' on the cost of circulating a library book .

		Whereas it would undoubtedly be possible to obtain the actual cost , I know of no library in which it is done .

		For the most part , critics divide the total expenditures by the number of volumes circulated , and quote the result as the cost per book .

		Some , endeavoring to be fairer , divide the amount spent on salaries by the vol - umes circulated , and quote the result thus obtained as the cost .

		Both methods are plainly inaccurate .

		The first sys - tem charges up as part of the cost of circulating a book the upkeep of grounds , lecture courses , and reference work ; also the cost of the books themselves .

		When this last item is included the library that circvilates tech - nical books that average between .


$ 3	MONEY	.

		and .

		`` S4 .

		each , makes an infinitely worse showing than the library that circulates the '' Duchess '' books , which cost between 30 and
40 cents	MONEY	each .

		The second method is faulty because a
Ubrary	ORGANIZATION	's salary list includes the salaries of persons connected solely with regular reference work , attendants for the bulk of the books on stacks which are rarely circulated , and cataloguers and bibliographers .

		Again , as it costs more to engage cataloguers who can catalogue Incunabula than it does to hire those who can handle the '' Duchess , '' the higher the class of books accumu - lated by the library the worse its comparative showing .

		Or take the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institu	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		Printed analytical cards for the
1907	DATE	volume cost
$ 1.16	MONEY	: the clerical labor in accessioning , preparing the book for the shelves and filing the cards would not be less than 25 to
35 cents	MONEY	, so that the total cost of cataloguing such a book is nearly SI .

		50 .

		Many libraries , too , when books that are called for are out , reserve them , and send postal notices when they are returned , without charge .

		Each such case adds
one cent	MONEY	to the cost of circulation , in addition to necessary clerical work .

		A branch library in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, of which I had charge , circulated over 300,000 volumes at a cost , if figured by the first method , of about four and
one-half cents	MONEY	.

		That was remarkably low , but the cost of administration in a branch library is always proportion - ally lower than that in a regular library .

		This library last year circulated over 150,000 volumes , and as its total expenses were less than
S7	ORGANIZATION	,200 the cost per vol - ume circulated , figured by the first method , was about
four cents	MONEY	.

		But
last year	DATE	was its first year of opera - tion , and in addition to its reference work not being fully developed , repairs to plant , bindery bills and replacements were lower than they can ever be in the future .

		As increased reading and research work is done in the building the cost of operating the library as compared with the number of volumes circulated will increase -- and we are looking forward to such develop - ment .

		One word more .

		A
Children 's Room	ORGANIZATION	over which 1 had charge at one time had but 2,500 volumes , yet it circulated annually over 60,000 volumes , a turnover circulation of 24 .

		On no day throughout the year were there more than 800 volumes in the library at one time , so that there was little shelving to keep in shape , while the room itself was small , with but three tables .

		The cost of administration was so low that it probably was a record breaker , but it should not be quoted , because neither sufficient books nor adequate facilities were pro- vided for the children .

		Does it not seem that the discussion of circulation costs , as at present figured , is really not only useless , but likely to do much harm to libraries that are endeav - oring to put more useful and therefore more expensive books in the hands of their readers ?

		Chinese Women and Chinese Ways .

		* Little by little , through the letters and diaries of missionaries and travellers , the western world is becoming better acquainted with that vast domain of the mysterious , the unexpected , the bewildering , and the anomalous , the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it will be long ere the mammoth puzzle is so completely solved as to lose its charm for lovers of the novel , the curious , and the baffling .

		Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	, widow of our late Min - ister to the Court of Peking , writes her '' Letters from
China	LOCATION	'' with all the zest , all the fresh curiosity , of an intelligent and observant woman visiting new and , in some instances , startling scenes for the first time .

		The character of her book , and its claims upon our serious attention , may be indicated by a few explanatory sentences from her '' Foreword . '' ''

		From my entrance into
China	LOCATION	, on through seven years , I worked with a fixed purpose to gain clearer ideas .

		To avoid all formalities and to simplify the recording of events , I have chosen , and here present , some of my private letters written to our daughter , sisters , nieces , and nephews .

		In these letters many heart - stories are told .

		May each letter carry a ray of light into the hearts of its readers , and reveal a little of the real character of the Chinese as it has been revealed to me .

		Our experiences in
China	LOCATION	were unique and extreme in many ways .

		Through the smaller and larger avenues of the almost iron-clad customs of
China	LOCATION	I was permitted to pass and to enter places where I beheld many won - derful things .

		That others may look upon a modified panorama of these views and help to correct the wide - spread and erroneous ideas about
China	LOCATION	and her people , I present this letter compilation . ''

		It is but natural that the women of
China	LOCATION	, and especially the most conspicuous woman of her time , the late Empress Dowager , should have most interested this American sojourner . ''

		The many conversations awarded me with Her Majesty , '' writes Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	, '' revealed much of the concealed force and value of
China	LOCATION	's women .

		Ignorance of these qualities has brought a pronounced misrepresentation of
China	LOCATION	's womanhood . ''

		Early in
1898	DATE	Mr.
Conger	PERSON	was called upon to transfer his diplomatic services from
Brazil	LOCATION	to the far East , and in the

		country and to breathe its atmosphere , one must not constantly carry one 's home with one , and hug the pleasing notion of American superiority to all other nations .

		She descended from her imaginary height '' with the determination to seek with open eyes and a willing heart , '' and found herself amply rewarded .

		An autumn out - ing that took the form of a visit to the Great Wall gives occasion for the following cheerful observations : '' Such a happy ride !

		On our way we saw many hun - dreds of fine camels ; these camels rest during the day and travel with their packs at night .

		The prosperity of the country was shown by the fine flocks of sheep , in the hundreds of mules laden with wool , hides , tea , fruits , grain , fodder , cotton , and other commodities .

		We met pack-cattle from
Mongolia	LOCATION	with red-faced Mongol drivers .

		We also met a number of mule litters , a few carts drawn by mules , and many men riding on don - keys .

		All were bent on business , and we were forcibly impressed with the fact that the Chinese do not seek their pleasure in travel .

		This well-kept road is a direct pass over the mountains from Peking to

		An event of considerable importance is chron - icled in an early page .

		Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	formed one of a party of foreign ministers ' wives who were the first women from the outer world to visit the imperial court and to be received by the imperial majesties .


December 13 , 1898	DATE	, was the epochal date of this sublime function , and the account of it , too long to reproduce here , is worthy of the occasion .

		Concerning the Empress Dowager herself , the centre of interest throughout the gorgeous pageant , we read : '' She was bright and happy and her face glowed with good will .

		There was no trace of cruelty to be seen .

		In simple expressions she welcomed us , and her actions were full of freedofn and warmth .

		Her Majesty arose and wished us well .

		She extended both hands toward each lady , then , touching herself , said with much enthusiastic earnestness , ` One family ; all one family . ' ''

		Upon the death of this masterful woman a few months ago , Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	wrote an appre - ciation of her character , and from this obituary eulogy , which is printed as an '' Afterword '' to her narrative , a few sentences may here be quoted .

		They are of value as coming from one who was admitted to '' an acquaintance that grew into friendship . '' ''

		Her Majesty 's keen perception knew the nations , and she often spoke to me with deep appreciation of
America	LOCATION	's attitude toward
China	LOCATION	... For forty-seven years this able woman has stood at the head of the Chinese Empire , and strong men have given their sup - port .

		In a land where woman has had so little official standing ,
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's achievements make her ability and strength more pronounced ; and
China	LOCATION	, surely , must be jealous for this reign in the sight of other nations ... Through this woman 's life the world catches a
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 glimpse of the hidden quality of
China	LOCATION	's womanhood .

		It savors of a quality that might benefit that of the Western World . ''

		In one of her earlier letters Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	says that '' the honor of woman is her child-bearing , and the more boys the greater the honor .

		The better classes of Chinese women never see for - eign men and seldom meet men of their own people .

		I am told that they do not labor ; a noble life-work is done if they bear even one or two children . ''

		As to those who do labor , the servants of both sexes , she has much to say , chiefly commendatory . ''

		I never knew such wonderful servants in ray life ; they are quiet , gentle , kind , and willing .

		Each knows his own work and does it ... The Chinese are quiet and accurate in their methods .

		They handle large columns of figures , make delicate calculations , and no amount of confusion or jostling disturbs them ; they work calmly on and seldom make mistakes .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	and in the foreign concessions I noticed that the banks employ the Chinese for their most important detail work .

		When in one of the large banks , I asked why the Chinese were employed in these responsible positions .

		The reply was : ' The three principal reasons are that they are honest , self-possessed , and accurate .

		They move so quietly that we are astonished at what they accomplish . ' ''

		The Boxer disturbances , falling within the period of Mr. and Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	's residence in
Peking	LOCATION	, afforded material for many anxious entries in the diary kept by the wife during that trying time , when communication with the outside world was almost entirely suspended and the long days of harrowing suspense dragged slowly by .

		For weeks every entry in this diary must have been made with little expectation that it would be followed by another .

		The wonder is that the writer , distracted by so many other claims on her time and attention , and with an intermittent hail of bullets and cannon-balls dealing death on every side , could have com - manded sufficient composure to carry on her journal of horrors .

		But the besieged , even those of the weaker sex , have done this before , as at
Lucknow	LOCATION	, at Lady smith , and at many another place stormed at by shot and shell and in momentary expectation of the worst .

		After the concentration of the foreign ministerial per - sonages and their servants , dependants , and military forces within the fortified enclosure of the British Legation , Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	recorded , when the agony was at its height , the following incident : '' The other day I said to a scholarly Chinese , ' Will you help to fill these sand bags ? '

		He replied , * I am no coolie . '

		Then I in turn said , ' I am no coolie either , but we must all work here and now .

		I will hold the bag and you come and shovel the sand . '

		I took a bag and a Russian-Greek priest stepped forward and filled it .

		He spoke no English and I no Russian , but we both under - stood the language of the situation .

		Other people rallied about us , and we soon stepped aside .

		Our work was finished .

		This scholarly Chinese was of the
American Legation	ORGANIZATION	's staff helpers .

		As rank is so respected in
China	LOCATION	, and as the Chinese do not wish to degrade the ranks , this man , from his point of view , could not fill sand bags .

		Mr.
Conger	PERSON	talked with him , saying , ' Your life as well as ours is to be protected here , and you must do your part or we can not feed you . '

		The man was in hiding three days .

		As our coming troops did not come , and he was near to starvation , he came to the front , willing to do what he could . ''

		Still more vividly is the peril depicted in an earlier passage , from which a brief extract solicits space for insertion . ''

		This morning three quarts of bullets were picked up that the enemy had fired into the
American Legation	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are to be melted and made into balls for the big gmi belonging to the Italians .

		All the temple candle - sticks , vases , images , in fact everything that can be melted , have been gathered and moulded into ammuni - tion .

		... A large iron ball just fell below our window , but it did no harm .

		The ball is still warm .

		Another , at least six inches in diameter , went whizzing through the walls of the British Minister 's dining-room .

		For - tunately it passed near the ceiling , so it did no damage aside from knocking off a corner of the frame of
Queen Victoria	ORGANIZATION	's portrait .

		The Chinese are firing their big guns by far too much for our comfort . ''

		Among the now somewhat numerous pub - lished diaries and letters and reminiscences of diplomats ' wives -- which have a way of being much more agreeable and sprightly reading than their husbands ' official despatches -- Mrs.
Con	PERSON	- ger 's volume is worthy of a high place .

		In range of observation and in fluency of descriptive narration she is not unlike
Madame Waddington	PERSON	, also an American by birth and breeding .

		The photographic illustrations of persons and places are generous in number and excellent in work - manship , and combine well with the handsome style of the book and its large , clear type to make it a very attractive volume .

		256 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , of the publisher , of books to which reference is made .

		The bibliography is fairly complete , but although giving Colonel
William Allan	PERSON	's ''
Jack	PERSON	- son 's Valley Campaign '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , it omits his '' Army of
Northern Virginia	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	'' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , the best work that has been published on this campaign .

		Colonel
Henderson	PERSON	's excellent life of
Jackson	PERSON	not excepted ; it also omits
Hotchkiss	PERSON	and
Allan	PERSON	's book on
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	-LRB- 1867 -RRB- , the first complete account of this notable battle that was published after the war .

		Whoever compiled the index to Dr. White 's book has been guilty of the error of confusing the references to two officers , General
Richard B. Garnett	PERSON	, command - ing the `` Stonewall Brigade '' in the battle of
Kernstown	LOCATION	, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Thomas S. Garnett	PERSON	, 48th
Virginia	LOCATION	regiment , commanding the second brigade of
Jackson	PERSON	's division at the battle of
Cedar Mountain	ORGANIZATION	.

		The last two refer - ences -LRB- pp. 241 , 242 -RRB- are to the latter , whose name is omitted in the index .

		Dr.
White	PERSON	's book gives us the usual accounts of General
Jackson	PERSON	's early life , his career at West Point , in
Mexico	LOCATION	, and at the
Virginia Military Institute	ORGANIZATION	to the
spring of 1861	DATE	.

		In this portion of his work the author draws upon the Rev. Dr.
Dabney	PERSON	's '' Life and Campaigns of General
Jackson	PERSON	'' and Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	's '' Life and Letters , '' both excellent authorities , and the latter a vivid portraiture of his domestic life .

		He shows us how conscientious and delib - erate were
Jackson	PERSON	's position and actions in the Civil War .

		With respect to the questions agitating the country at the outbreak of the war .

		Dr.
White	PERSON	says truly : '' His judgment and his sympathies were in full accord with the views that prevailed among the people of the South with reference to political and social affairs . ''

		Dr. White also makes clear the fact that
Jackson	PERSON	'' was always a friend and bene - factor to the colored man , '' as was shown by his teaching in and contributing to the support of a colored Sunday-school in
Lexington	LOCATION	. ''

		He believed , however , says his wife , ' that the
Bible	LOCATION	taught that slavery was sanctioned by the Creator Himself ... for ends which it was not his business to determine . ' ''

		He believed , too , that '' the South ought to resist aggression , if necessary by the sword , '' and that any of the States had the right to secede from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Therefore , when
Virginia	LOCATION	chose to exercise that right , he was found in thorough accord with all her people except some dwelling in
West Virginia	LOCATION	.

		In a short speech to his student cadets , on the occasion of raising the
Virginia	LOCATION	flag at the
Military Institute	ORGANIZATION	at
Lexington	LOCATION	, he said : '' The time may come when your State will need your services ; and if that time does come , then draw your swords and throw away the scabbards . ''

		This tersely shows the spirit of the man ; and it is credibly stated that later in the war he was in favor of raising the black flag .

		Whatever he did , he believed in doing thoroughly .

		He accepted , with General
Sher	PERSON	- man , the dictum that `` War is hell , '' and was ready to act upon it .

		Dr.
White	PERSON	has given a succinct and well - selected account of the chief events in General
Jackson	PERSON	's life , and has written a book that will serve as a good resume of his military career .

		We should have liked a fuller criticism of his generalship ; but that want has been already well supplied in Colonel
Henderson	PERSON	's book , to which we have referred .

		His military talents were not appreciated until after his Valley cam - paign , which was , indeed , the first occasion on which he had an opportunity to display them .

		While in command at
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry , in
1861	DATE	,
Jackson	PERSON	formed the
First Brigade	ORGANIZATION	of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Shenandoah	LOCATION	, composed of the 2d , 4th , 5th , 27th , and 33d
Virginia	LOCATION	regiments , and the
Rockbridge Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, which last had been organized at
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and was com - manded by the Rev. Dr.
William N. Pendleton	PERSON	, rector of the
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Lexington	LOCATION	and a graduate of West Point .

		When General
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	was placed in command at
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry , Colonel
Jackson	PERSON	was assigned to the command of the
First Brigade	ORGANIZATION	, and was soon promoted to the rank of brigadier-general , receiving his commission at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
July 3 , 1861	DATE	.

		The name of ''
Stonewall	PERSON	' ' was due to an exclamation made by General Bee , when rally - ing his own brigade at
Manassas	LOCATION	-LRB- Bull Run -RRB- on
July 21	DATE	of that year .

		The phraseology is given differently by different writers , but that given by Dr. White will answer as well as any other : '' Look !

		There is
Jackson	PERSON	standing like a stone wall !

		Rally behind the Virginians ! ' '

		-LRB- pp. 87-8 -RRB- .

		There is no question that
Jackson	PERSON	's charge at the opportune moment gained the day at
Manassas	LOCATION	.

		He was always in favor of a charge , and of '' giving them the bayonet . ''

		On the occasion of this memorable battle , the
Rockbridge Artillery	ORGANIZATION	-- to which body the writer of the present article belonged -- had been firing for about two and a half hours , chiefly at
Griffin	PERSON	's and
Ricketts	PERSON	's batteries near the
Henry	ORGANIZATION	house , --
Jackson	PERSON	's brigade meanwhile lying down in the woods in the rear , -- when the artillery was suddenly ordered off the field , much to their surprise .

		As soon as they had cleared the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 ground , the infantry were ordered to rise and charge ; and as the other troops did the same , and
Early	ORGANIZATION	's and
Kirby Smith	ORGANIZATION	's brigades came in on the left , the enemy were soon put to flight and did not stop before reaching Centre ville .

		It is the writer 's belief that our victorious troops should have pressed on to
Washington	LOCATION	, as General
Jackson	PERSON	wished , supplies or no supplies , and there seems little reason to doubt that we could have reached the Federal capital .

		The limits of this article will not permit even an outline of General
Jackson	PERSON	's full career .

		It will be found well stated in Dr. White 's book .

		For the early portion of it , the reader is directed especially to Colonel
Allan	PERSON	's ''
Jackson	PERSON	's Valley Campaign , '' for it was this campaign that called attention to
Jackson	PERSON	's military abilities , and it affords material for a special study in military strategy .

		His main object was to prevent the reinforcement of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	near
Richmond	LOCATION	; and in this he succeeded to his complete satisfac - tion .

		After routing
Milroy	PERSON	and
Schenck	PERSON	at
McDowell	ORGANIZATION	,
Jackson	PERSON	hastened back to the
Valley	LOCATION	and there overthrew Banks .

		Then , escaping '' by the skin of his teeth '' between
Fremont	LOCATION	and
Shields	PERSON	, he routed them both on successive days , so that one retreated to
Strasburg	PERSON	and the other to
Front Royal	ORGANIZATION	.

		After a short breathing - space ,
Jackson	PERSON	hurried to
Richmond	LOCATION	and aided General
Lee	PERSON	, forcing
McClellan	PERSON	's army back to
Harrison	PERSON	's Landing on the
James River	LOCATION	-- the so-called '' change of base . ''

		There was a '' change of base , '' but the prevailing cause of it was the defeat of
Porter	ORGANIZATION	's corps at
Gaines	ORGANIZATION	's Mill ,
June 27	DATE	, caused by
Jackson	PERSON	's well-timed attack on the Confederate left .

		While
Jackson	PERSON	failed to accomplish what Lee had wished at White Oak Swamp , and the army failed at
Malvern	LOCATION	Hill by reason of its irregular and disjointed attacks on that formidable position , the general result was the relief of
Richmond	LOCATION	and the withdrawal of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's army to
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		The battle of
Cedar Mountain	ORGANIZATION	and the defeat 6f Banks 's troops on that field were but an episode in
Pope	LOCATION	's campaign .

		His turn came at
Manassas	LOCATION	, from which his '' grand army '' took refuge in the fortifications around
Washington	LOCATION	.


Jackson	PERSON	's corps withstood Pope at
Manassas	LOCATION	until Longstreet arrived and made his attack on the right , which lack of daylight alone prevented from being a complete success .

		A few weeks later the battle of
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	-LRB-
Antietam	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- followed , a battle of one to two and a half -- 35,000 to 87,000 -- and rightly charac - terized as '' the best-fought battle of the war '' on the Confederate side .

		After giving
McClellan	PERSON	an opportunity to attack the
next day	DATE	, which he did not take .

		General Lee retired across the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		A little later
McClellan	PERSON	was suc - ceeded by
Burnside	PERSON	, whose bloody attack and repulse at
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	soon followed .

		Then , in
May	DATE	, with
Hooker	PERSON	in command of the Northern army ,
Jackson	PERSON	performed his brilliant feat of marching around and surprising the
Union	LOCATION	right , effecting again a Confederate vic - tory , which was clouded by the loss of his own life from wounds received from some of his men while venturing on a personal reconnoissance beyond his lines in the dark .

		It is hardly too much to say that in that dire mishap perished the hopes of the Confederacy .

		How great , how irrepar - able , was that loss was shown only a few weeks later at the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, which has been rightly regarded as the turning-point of the war - With
Jackson	PERSON	's genius in strategy and power in action added to the strength of the Confederates , who can say how different might have been the issue of that great battle , and even of the war ?

		* Disillusionment is not always desirable .

		The delectable domain of the imagination affords a welcome retreat from the wear and tear of the work-day world .

		But it is a land wherein the verities are not physical ; and in contemplating the sober facts of the universe there is gain , not loss , in being able to see them as they really are .

		This is peculiarly true as regards the finer achievements of Oriental art .

		One by one , Western misconceptions of the East have given way before the tide of advancing knowledge .

		No longer do we speak of that part of the world as '' gorgeous , '' '' magnificent , '' or '' unchang - ing . ''

		These phrases belong to a day when nearly the whole sum of available information was supplied by such books as `` The Arabian Nights '' and `` The Travels of

Coleridge	PERSON	's ''

		268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, arms and armor , and the precious stones brought from
India	LOCATION	by the early traders and soldiers who visited that far-away land .

		Then came the glowing accounts of visitors to
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, and the lovely porcelains , the rich silks , the charming lacquer , brought from these countries .

		What wonder that these things should give rise to visions of abounding wealth and luxury ?

		Gradually we have learned that the people of the East are not rich but poor ; that the sensu - ous magnificence was never widespread , but chiefly found in the trappings of a few
Moham	PERSON	- medan princes .

		We have learned , too , that the influence of Mohammedanism upon the creative arts has been blighting through the restrictions it has imposed .

		We have studied the decorative arts of
India	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	, and have found them rich in suggestion and full of lessons for our artists and art lovers ; we have even , in the color prints of
Japan	LOCATION	, caught a glimpse of the pictorial art of the
East	LOCATION	at the point where it most nearly approaches that of the
West	LOCATION	.

		What in any general sense we have not yet apprehended is that back of all these manifestations there is a central tradition of Asian painting , based upon a coherent , clearly - visioned , and completely thought-out funda - mental metaphysic ; that in its essence it is an art of form rather than of color , an art domi - nated by poetical ideas , distinguished by extreme simplicity , exquisite refinement , and rigorous adhesion to aesthetic principles , and requiring for its expression a masterly technique .

		This art forms the theme of Mr.
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	's '' Painting in the Far East . ''

		His book is a notable one , comprehensive in its out - look , clear in its statements , and irrefragable in its philosophy .

		Realizing that the criteria by which the art of the East should be judged are not other than those we should apply to the art of the West , he has approached his subject with an open mind , and has not been led astray by either the strangeness of the conventions employed or by differences in the things repre - sented .

		These criteria are set forth with admir - able clarity in a remarkable opening chapter on '' The Art of the East and the West , '' which as an exposition of basic principles coidd hardly be surpassed .

		To those who are imbued with the notion '' absorbed from an age of triumphant science , '' as Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	puts it , that the test of artistic merit is in fidelity to an external objec - tive standard , having the utmost attainable realism as its shibboleth , his telling phrases and forceful arguments may be especially com - mended .

		By those who have passed beyond the stage of art appreciation where that aU too common heresy is tenable , his words will be read with keen satisfaction .

		With
Hsieh Ho	PERSON	, the Chinese artist and critic of the sixth century , whose theory of aesthetic principles formulated in his '' Six Canons '' is a classic imanimously accepted by posterity , Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	rightly holds that rhythm , organic structure , and harmony are the paramount qualities in all works of art .

		Only as we grasp this concept are the higher beauties revealed to us , and their spiritual meanings made visible .

		Only through it are our eyes opened to the fuU significance of the truth that art consists in the welding of forms , hues , and tones into synthetic and organic unity , and that its vital essence is not imitative but creative .

		With deep insight Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	writes : '' In this theory every work of art is thought of as an incarnation of the genius of rhythm , manifesting the living spirit of things with a clearer beauty and inteuser power than the gross impediments of complex matter allow to be transmitted to our senses in the visible world around us .

		A picture is conceived as a sort of appari - tion from a more real world of essential life . ''

		Alone among all the great art movements in the world 's history , Asian painting has followed unswervingly the guidance of this concept .

		Even the noble art of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	fell from its high estate into the slough of realism for realism 's sake .

		But in the
Far East	LOCATION	, throughout all the changes in style caused by the coming into vogue of novel phases or manners of representation , -- changes as numerous and varied as similar fashions and styles evolved in the course of cen - turies in the several countries of
Europe	LOCATION	, -- the central tradition has never been lost sight of or departed from , until within very recent years through a baleful influx of Western ideas .

		The consequence is -- or rather was , for the pale reflection that survives can not be said to be more than half alive -- an art absolutely self - contained , homogeneous , consistent , and , in its higher reaches , of tenuous but nevertheless entrancing purity .

		As aptly expressed by Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	: '' Who shall say of such an art that it is not mature , still less that it is impotent to express ideas ?

		In its coherence and its concentration , in its resolute hold on the idea of organic beauty , this tradition , so old in the
East	LOCATION	, manifests the character of an art that has reached complete development . ''

		It is not strange that this art should as yet be little understood or appreciated in
Western	LOCATION	lands , except by a small group of enthusiasts .

		Opportunities for seeing and studying fine works are extremely limited .

		Though a considerable
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 number of paintings bearing the names of , or confidently attributed to , illustrious Chinese and Japanese artists , have found a market in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, many of them -- in fact a very large percentage -- are spurious or of doubtful authenticity .

		Besides the forgeries , there are ancient copies , some of them extremely clever , and works by lesser men with the signatures erased and others substituted .

		Even the for - eign dweller in the
East	LOCATION	may pass a decade there without getting a glimpse of a painting of the first rank .

		The owners of important works keep them carefully packed away in fire-proof storehouses , and though they are occasionally brought forth and exhibited to a chosen few , it is rarely indeed that a Western barbarian is included among those deemed worthy of the honor of seeing them .

		Why should such trea - sures be shown to those whose judgment in matters of art is hopelessly warped through the importation of scientific views ?

		This attitude of mind is well illustrated by an incident that occurred during the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the Japanese Commissioners brought with him when he came to
Chicago	LOCATION	a highly valued painting by one of the old masters .

		Showing it one day to a gentleman who was able to appreciate its fuU worth , he was asked why he did not hang it up where others might have a chance to enjoy its beauty .

		Note the reply : `` I could not bear to see people pass it by without pausing to admire . ''

		When feeling is so intense as that indicated by these words , it is easy to understand how deep a wound may be inflicted by a flippant remark , or even by well - intentioned but ignorant and inept comment .

		From such suffering the Oriental saves himself by not casting his pearls where Circe 's herd may come .

		For those in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	who have cared to look into the merit of Asian painting the collections in the
Boston	LOCATION	Museum of Fine Arts and the British Museum , and works pass - ing through the hands of dealers , have afforded the chief opportunities .

		Besides these , paintings in private collections have furnished further sources to the few having access to them .

		Some information has been available from books , for the most part publications that are costly or not readily obtainable .

		The first glimpse of the sub - ject was given by Dr.
William Anderson	PERSON	in an essay read before the
Asiatic Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Japan	LOCATION	and printed in its Transactions in
1879	DATE	.

		Next , in
1883	DATE	, came the very inadequate chapter on painting in
Louis Gonse	LOCATION	's elaborate '' L'Art Japonais . ''

		Three years later Dr.
Anderson	PERSON	's monumental '' Descriptive and Historical Cata - logue of Japanese and Chinese Paintings in the British Museum '' was issued , and in the same year , also , his `` Pictorial Arts of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' a sumptuous folio containing many elaborate repro - ductions of paintings .

		But the largest supply of material for study has been yielded by the Japanese magazine called '' Kokka , '' now in its twentieth year , and by the splendid reproduc - tions in '' Select Relics of Japanese Art , '' pub - lished in
Tokyo	LOCATION	and edited , with text in Japanese and English , by Mr.
S. Tajima	PERSON	.

		Various minor sources of information might also be enimierated ; and in this country the illuminating lectures of the late Professor
Ernest F. Fenollosa	PERSON	brought a precious fund of first-hand knowledge within reach of those so situated that they could attend them .

		Aside from these lectures there has hitherto been no presentation of a broad view over the entire field of Asian painting , following its development not only in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, but , so far as material exists , in
Thibet	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	, and other countries .

		Such a view is now furnished by Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	's book .

		It is , as he says in the preface , '' an attempt to survey the achievement and to interpret the aims of Oriental painting , and to appreciate it from the standpoint of a European in relation to the rest of the world 's art . ''

		In this he has succeeded well , -- remark - ably well , considering that his knowledge has been gained in the course of his official duties as keeper of the Chinese and Japanese paint - ings and prints in the British Museum , and that he has not been able to visit
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, nor even to see the masterpieces of Oriental painting in the
Boston Museum	LOCATION	and in the mag - nificent collection formed by Mr.
Charles L. Freer	PERSON	of
Detroit	LOCATION	.

		With wider opportunities it is possible that he would feel called upon to modify his conceptions of the work of particular artists , but the general historic outline and state - ment of guiding principles are all that could be desired .

		While future research may add ma - terially to our knowledge , it does not seem prob - able that there will be occasion to alter widely the main lines as here laid down .

		In one respect , and one only , the book is disappointing .

		A few minor blemishes , such as the retention of a form of spelling of Japanese names which does not correctly transliterate them , and which is now abandoned by Japanese scholars -- more particularly the use of the silent y before the vowel e , -- may be passed over without further mention .

		But the illustrations , though they include some exceptionally splendid 260 THE DIAL -LSB- AprQ 16 , and impressive works , fall far short , on the whole , of being either adequate or fairly repre - sentative .

		Indeed it is not impossible that for some readers they may have the effect of controverting the author 's cogent words , since pictures are likely to be more convincing than anything that can be said about them , more especially when their unfamiliar character makes it difficult to allow for the inevitable loss in reproduction by a mechanical process .

		At its best the collotype yields a lifeless residt ; and when it is employed to reproduce ancient paint - ings of which good photographs can not be made , the feeble travesty that ensues is absolutely meaningless .

		It is fair to state that the choice was governed in this instance by the necessity of keeping the cost within reasonable limits .

		Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	's book is worthy of more fitting illustration .

		Should another edition be called for it is hoped that such illustrations as are given will be of authenticated masterpieces , upon a scale and by a process that will reveal something of their qualities .

		Those in the present volume help the reader but little to realize the truth so well expressed in the sentences with which the book closes : '' If we look back over the whole course of that great Asian tradition of painting which we have been follow - ing through the centuries , the art impresses us as a whole by its cohesion , solidarity , order , and harmony .

		But these qualities are not truly perceived till we know something of the life out of which it flowered .

		We then see that paintings which in themselves seem slight , light , and wayward are not mere individual caprices , but answer to the common thoughts of men , symbolize some spiritual desire , have behind them the power of sortie cherished and heart-refreshing ideal , and are supported by links of inttnite association with poetry , with religion , yet also with the lives of humble men and women .

		We shall study this art in vain if we are not moved to think more clearly , to feel more profoundly ; to realize in the unity of all art , the unity of life . ''


Frederick W. Gookin	PERSON	.

		The Maid of
France	LOCATION	.

		* It would seem that there can be at present no great need for either a biogi-aphy or a defence of
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	.

		Her story is well known ; her achievements are admitted , and her place in history is secure ; the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has placed her only a little lower than the saints .

		There was a time when the verdict of history was not so favorable ; but , so far as
England	LOCATION	is concerned , that time has long been past .

		Since the days of Dr.
Lingard	PERSON	-LRB- and
Lingard	PERSON	wrote nearly a • The Maid of
France	LOCATION	.

		By
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		With portraits .

		New York : Longrmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		century ago -RRB- , no English historian of any repute has shown the least hostility either toward the Maid or toward her work .

		It is agreed on all sides that when the awakened French patriotism of the fifteenth century hurled the British inva - sion back across the Channel , it saved
England	LOCATION	from embarrassments and perils that might have proved serious difficulties in the future .

		But the Maid of
France	LOCATION	is more than a great figure in history : she is a mysterious problem m psychology , and as such has begun to interest the modern scientist .

		Out of this new interest a bitter quarrel has developed , for the results of this scientific study have not been wholly in the Maid 's favor . ''

		She is represented as a martyr , a heroine , a puzzle - headed hallucinated lass , a perplexed wanderer in a realm of dreams , the unconscious tool of fraudulent priests , herself once doubtfully honest , apt to tell great palpable myths to her own glorification , never a leader in war , but only a kind of mascotte , a '' little saint , '' and a heguine in breeches . ''

		And now comes Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, the poet-philosopher of
Scotland	LOCATION	, who is also both an historian and a scientist , with a book in defence of the remarkable Maid .

		That such a work of apology should come from
Scotland	LOCATION	seems exceedingly appropriate ; for the Scots , the author tells us , '' did not buy or sell , or try , or condemn , or persecute , or burn , or -- most shameful of all -- bear witness against and desert the Maid .

		The Scots stood for her always , with pen as with sword . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's defence , however , is not a barrister 's plea , but a thorough , sympathetic study of Jeannes career , the results of which disprove all the assertions of the hostile critics .

		Biography is frequently dull reading .

		The author 's sense of duty too often leads him to include trivial matters with the really important ones , and the result is an inartistic product .

		But in the present case no such criticism applies .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book is a work of great interest ; every page is alive with the zeal and the energy of the brilliant biographer .

		Critics may not always approve of Mr.
Langs	PERSON	literary methods , but they rarely accuse him of being dull .

		It might be said with truth that the present study does not display the calm judicious temper that the historian ought to possess .

		Indeed , the author seems inclined toward
Herr Treitschke	PERSON	's belief that history should be written in anger .

		In speaking of the trial of the Maid at
Rouen	LOCATION	, he characterizes the leading judges and assessors in the following terms : '' De la
Fontaine	PERSON	, Le Maitre ,
Midi	PERSON	, and Feuillet were the examiners who sought their own damnation on this
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 day .

		Who are we that we should judge them , crea - tures as they were , full of terror , of superstition , and of hatred ; with brows of brass and brains of lead ; scien - tific , too , as the men of their time reckoned science . ''

		This is not in the style of the doctor 's disserta - tion , but it is far more effective ; and , from a writer who is a member of so many literary guilds , we can not expect a dispassionate treat - ment throughout , especially when the theme is so dramatic as is the life and death of
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	.

		No doubt the parts of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's work that will attract the most attention are his discussions and analyses of the various problems that make up such a large part of the Maid 's history .

		Some of these are satisfactorily treated ; but a suffi - cient number remain unsolved to call forth many future studies .

		In a review it is , of course , impossible to follow out the author 's arguments ; the leading conclusions alone can be stated .

		First and greatest of the problems is that of the '' voices '' and the visions .

		These matters are discussed in various sections of the narrative , and are also made the subject of an appendix . ''

		Nobody now asserts that her psychological experiences were feigned by her ; nobody denies that she had the experiences ; nobody ascribes them , like the learned of
Paris University	ORGANIZATION	, to ' Satan , Belial , and Behemoth . ' ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, therefore , concludes that so far as
Jeanne	PERSON	was concerned the '' voices '' were real ; but what was their nature ?

		In his discussions he examines and rejects various explanations recently pro- posed hj scientific minds .

		Hysteria , underde - velopment , or nervous disorders of various sorts have been suggested ; but the evidence points to none of these ;
Jeanne	PERSON	appears in every other respect to have been sane and normal .

		The attempt to classify
Jeanne	PERSON	's experiences with those of ecstatics also seems to have failed ; she is never known to have been subject to trances ; when the voices came to her and spoke to her , she still remained perfectly conscious of every - thing about her ; her understanding of the com - mon things of life was not in the least disturbed .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	apparently subscribes to the opinion that the '' voices '' were expressions of uncon - scious thinking -LRB- whatever that may be -RRB- .

		He confuses the matter somewhat in one of his clos - ing sentences : '' I incline to think that in a sense not easily defined
Jeanne	PERSON	was ` inspired , ' and I am convinced that she was a person of the high - est genius , of the noblest character . ''

		But inspired is a broad and vague term that gives little definite information .

		The theory that the '' voices '' were the Maid 's own unconscious thoughts which finally became so definite and so real as to lead her to think that they came from the outside is also rather xmsatisfactory .

		How did the young illiterate peasant girl in distant
Lorraine	PERSON	come to have such remarkable uncon - scious thoughts ?

		Whence did she obtain her information ?

		And what shall we say of her foreknowledge of events ?

		For we have evidence that in a few instances she possessed prophetic knowledge .

		She predicted in
April , 1429	DATE	, that she would be wounded by an arrow , but not fatally ; she was actually wounded on
May 7	DATE	.

		She also had foreknowledge of her capture ; but this for obvious reasons she kept secret .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	also discusses the question of the Maid 's military abilities .

		His reply to the critics who deny that
Jeanne	PERSON	was more than an influence for patriotism is a summary of her military record . ''

		A girl understood , and a girl employed -LRB- so profes - sional students of strategy and tactics declare -RRB- , the essential ideas of the military art ; namely , to concen - trate quickly , to strike swiftly , to strike hard , to strike at vital points , and , despising vain noisy skirmishes and ' valiances , ' to fight with invincible tenacity of purpose .

		• .

		.

		She possessed what , in a
Napoleon	LOCATION	, a
Marlborough	LOCATION	, a
Kellermann	LOCATION	at
Alba de Tormes	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
1809	DATE	-RRB- , would be reckoned the insight of genius .

		At the same time the author admits that the greatest service of the Maid lay along inspira - tional lines .

		What
France	LOCATION	just then needed was patriotism , courage , and confidence .

		Historical writers usually tell us that
Jeanne	PERSON	understood her mission as including two achieve - ments only : the relief of
Orleans	LOCATION	and the coronation of the
Dauphin	LOCATION	at
Rheims	LOCATION	.

		The inference is that her subsequent campaign was carried on in defiance of the '' voices '' and against her own wishes .

		For these statements Mr.
Lang	PERSON	finds no warrant .

		The reluctant ones were the king and his advisers ;
Jeanne	PERSON	was eager to continue the warfare with a view to seizing
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The campaign failed , but the failure is not to be charged to the Maid 's account -- she displayed the same courage as earlier ; it was the inevitable result of cowardice and divided councils at court .

		Even after her capture she seems to have been anxious to con - tinue fighting the English ; '' could she have escaped from prison at any time in
1431	DATE	, she would have taken up arms again . ''

		The Maid had a presentiment that her career would not be long ; she knew that she '' would last but a year or little more . ''

		The relief of Orleans began in
May , 1429	DATE	;
Jeanne	PERSON	was cap - tured at Compi ^ gne ,
May 23 , 1530	DATE	.


January 3 , 1431	DATE	, she was turned over to
Cauchon	LOCATION	, bishop 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, of
Beauvais	LOCATION	, for trial ; on
May 30	DATE	she was burned .

		Whether the Maid had a fair trial is a question that has been '' angrily debated . ''

		Some historians have argued that , as the laws and customs were in the
fifteenth century	DATE	, the judges were not unfair .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	holds to a different view : in cases where the accused were believed to have been in the service of the evil powers , the aim was not to find out the truth but to convict ; '' no person in the situation of
Jeanne	PERSON	, a feared and hated captive in hostile hands , -- no man accused of high treason or of witchcraft , -- had anywhere , for centuries after
1431	DATE	, the slightest chance of being fairly tried . ''

		And the record of the trial as given in the clos - ing chapters of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's biography is not such as to convict the judges of the least desire to be fair and just .

		A difficult problem in connection with the trial is that of
Jeanne	PERSON	's abjuration .

		About a week before the final tragedy , she was induced to submit to the commands of the church and to denounce her '' saints '' as spirits of evil ; at least such is the accepted account .

		We have a document of some length in which the Maid goes to the full extent of abjuration and sub - mission .

		This document the author , on appar - ently good grounds , calls into question .

		But even if this particular document is a forgery or a falsification of the record , it seems probable that at this time
Jeanne	PERSON	's heroism suffered a momen - tary eclipse .

		`` The question is regarded as important , for , it is argued , if
Jeanne	PERSON	pronounced the words of the long form of abjuration , she perjured herself , and can not be regarded as a person of ' heroic ' and saintly virtue .

		Considering her circumstances , her long sufferings , the mental confusion caused by the tumult ; the promises of escape from the infamous company of base English grooms ; and the terror of the fire , I can not regard her , -- even if she recited and set her mark to the long abju - ration , -- as less ' heroic ' than St.
Peter	PERSON	was when he thrice denied his Lord .

		It is cruel , it is inhuman , to blame the girl for not soaring above the apostolic heroism of the fiery Galilean ; for being , at one brief moment , less noble than herself . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has produced a useful and interest - ing biography , but it can not be regarded as final .

		Until the borderlands of thought have been more thoroughly explored , the career of the Maid will remain a mystery .

		The nature of the evidence is also such as to make the matter of interpreta - tion an extremely difficult task : it is largely made up of the records of two trials , the first for the purpose of condemnation -LRB- 1431 -RRB- , and the second -LRB-
twenty years later	DATE	-RRB- for the purpose of rehabilitation .

		While the author has apparently written for the general reader , he has not for - gotten the needs of the serious student : the work is provided with a fair index , and all the import - ant statements are fortified with references to the authorities used .

		The notes are , however , placed at the close of the volume instead of at the foot of the pages .

		The illustrations consist of two pictures of the Maid -LRB- miniatures from the close of the fifteenth century -RRB- , a portrait of
Charles VIL	PERSON	, and three maps .

		Kkcent Fiction .

		* '' This is a novel , not a treatise , '' says Mr.
Wells	PERSON	midway in '' Tono-Bungay , '' but we have doubts .

		Nevertheless we persevere , and are rewarded by witnessing the play of an active and original mind about most of the problems , individual and collective , with which modern man is confronted .

		It would be vain to expect Mr.
Wells	PERSON	to keep his social philos - ophy out of a novel , or his technical scientific knowl - edge , or his peculiarly mean conception of average humanity .

		He seems to work upon the theory that the best way to arouse man to a sense of what he might become is to make a merciless exposure of what he actually is , studied in a selection of the most despicable instances .

		This negative method of exalting an idealism may be effective when em - ployed by such indignant spirits as Swift and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, but when it is developed in the vein of comedy nearly always worked by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, it becomes almost futile for any higher purpose than that of entertain - ment . ''

		Tono-Bungay '' has many longueurs ^ but despite them is a vastly entertaining novel .

		It is the story of a great fortune erected upon a founda - tion of humbug , for its title is the name of the patent medicine which raises its exploiter from poverty to aflBuence .

		That Napoleonic charlatan reminds us not a little of the elder
Vance	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's novel , but with just the difference that distinguishes caricature from character-drawing .

		The story is told by his nephew , who shares in the fortune , and just escapes discredit in its collapse .

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 of mistake that unthinking youth frequently makes , the second distinctly disreputable , and the third an affair that ends with the rocket-like fall of the Tono - Bungay enterprise .

		The author tries very hard to make this third affair a matter of real passion and appeal to sympathy , but is imperfectly successful .

		A hero of fiction must have heroic qualities some - where latent within him , and such qualities are not here discernible .

		There is good comedy in the book , but nothing that strikes deeper , unless we look for it in the pages that are frankly philosophical , and have nothing to do with the action .

		Curiously enough , Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	's '' Sep - timus '' is also in large measure the story of a patent medicine .


Clem Sypher	PERSON	, however , is unlike the inventor of Tono-Bungay in that the former believes in his Cure , and in its divine mission of healing the skins of all mankind .

		There is something almost tragic in his dejection when he is informed by a man of science , in the plainest of language , that it is a device of quackery , and at the same time discovers that it is without efficacy when applied to the blistered heel of its own inventor .

		Clem is a good deal of a man , however , and we are not deeply per - turbed when the heroine -- magnificent creatui'e though she be -- finally rewards his devotion , and accepts the responsibilities of her sex .

		As for Sep - timus , who also loves her in dumb ecstasy , we feel that reality has shaped for him a better life than that of his dreams when his fortunes are at last annexed to those of the heroine 's less imposing but more domestic sister .

		Septimus is an inventor also , but of machines , not medicines .

		He is a shy creature , whose simple goodness wins our affection , and whose unconsciously humorous observations upon all sorts of subjects keep us in a cheerful mood .

		There is not much story in this entertaining book , nor is there anything like reality of human characterization , but there is satirical wit in abundance and there is the most delicious whimsicality .

		The satisfaction which we get from this , as from Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's other recent novels , is intellectual rather than emotional , and is of the keenest sort .

		Something less successful , on the whole , than '' The Morals of
Marcus Ordeyne	PERSON	'' and `` The Beloved Vagabond , '' this new book is nevertheless a delightful affair , and it would be ungrateful to place much stress upon the slight feel - ing of disappointment that comes from a comparison with its predecessors .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	works upon a small canvas in '' The Point of Honor , '' and the product more than justifies the self-imposed limitation .

		His longer books are often hard to read because of their diffuseness and over-indulgence in analysis , but this one offers no such impediment to the reader 's sustained satisfac - tion .

		It is a tale of the Napoleonic wars , which , however , form only a background for the single personal relation which is the substance of the narrative .

		Two minor French officers get into a quarrel over a trivial matter , and a duel results .

		During the following years , their paths diverge and come together many times , and each time of renewed contact sees a renewal of the quarrel , and another duel .

		They advance in grade and become generals , then , after the Restoration , they live on as grizzled veterans , and still the feud persists .

		It has become a tradition in military circles , although no one seems to know the fons et origo of all this animosity .

		The original quarrel , forced by a hot-headed and envious soldier upon his generous rival , is kept alive by the unreasonable attitude of the former , and the latter , despite his abhorrence of the situation , finds a point of honor in accepting the challenges that come from year to year .

		In their last duel , however , the chal - lenger is at his rival 's mercy , and his life is forfeit according to the code .

		He is spared under these humiliating conditions , and for the rest of his life can do nothing more serious than vent his spleen by grumbling .

		Meanwhile , as a disgraced Bonapartist , he is in sore straits , but his rival finds a way of supporting him without his suspecting the source of supply .

		The story is crisply told , with much acute comment and humorous observation .

		It is in reality a grave comedy of cross-purposes keyed to a certain moderate pitch of dramatic intensity which is hardly changed from beginning to end .

		A variant from the usual type of the sensational fiction which deals with things Russian is offered in ''
Joan of Garioch	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Albert Kinross	PERSON	.

		Instead of the old-fashioned tale of nihilist conspiracies and Siberian horrors we have an up-to-date story of the recent Russian revolution , with the Baltic provinces , and especially Rig ^ , for the scene of its action .

		The hero is an English soldier who returns from
South Africa	LOCATION	to learn that his betrothed has married a mysterious foreigner and disappeared .

		It seems that her father has been involved in a speculative enter - prise that has wrecked his fortune and threatened his honor , and that the heroine has given herself as a sacrifice to the man who has offered to save her father 's reputation by paying his debts .

		We call her the heroine in default of a better , but she hardly appears during the whole course of the narrative , which is chiefly concerned with the hero 's efforts to discover her hiding-place .

		For the name given by her husband , the Count de
Jarnac	LOCATION	, is a fictitious one , and the address which he has left upon his departure from
England	LOCATION	is a blind .

		In fact , he is a Russian of high standing , and when he learns that the lover is in hot pursuit , he resorts to all sorts of villainous devices for the deceiving and undoing of his rival .

		This is the framework of a very pretty story of wild adventure and hairbreadth escape , which naturally ends with the death of the villain and the union of the faithful lovers .

		Although the love-interest is kept well in the background , there are all sorts of romantic compensations for this defect , and the inter - est of the story does not flag in a single chapter . ''

		Mirage , '' by Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	, is a ten - der and pathetic story of belated love and unselfish renunciation .

		The
Vicomte du Guesclin	ORGANIZATION	has lost his fortune , gone into English exile , and is eating his heart out in a
London	LOCATION	lodging-house .

		An unex - pected legacy gives him a simple coxxntry pied-h-terre 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, -LRB- also in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- , and he finds among his neighbors a young French girl whose mother had been the love of his youth .

		In his association with this girl , both youth and love are renewed , and when the prospect of restored fortune opens before him , he seeks to make his dream a reality , and wins the girl 's con - sent to become his wife .

		It is affection rather than love that she has to give him , but for a time he is persuaded that it is the deeper sentiment .

		Then the castle in
Spain	LOCATION	crumbles , for fortune again eludes him , and the girl 's heart is instinctively given to a young Englishman who appears opportunely -LRB- or inopportunely -RRB- upon the scene at the critical mo - ment .

		The Vicomte is too fine a gentleman to permit her to make the sacrifice which she is yet willing to make , and the light goes out of his life .

		It is a delicate and charming tale , with soft lights and subtle characterizations .

		This theme of the
St. Martin	ORGANIZATION	's
summer	DATE	of love has been used many times in fiction , but rarely -LRB- by English writers -RRB- to equally artistic effect .

		There is also a vein of happy humor running through the pages , which notably relieves the burden of their essential pathos .

		The story of ''
Lorimer	PERSON	of the Northwest '' is now much more than a twice-told tale , for it already exists in more than half a dozen replicas .

		But as long as Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	is able to com ` pose equally interesting variations upon the theme his books will have enough novelty to continue attractive .

		The story , in substance , is that of the English settler in the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, of his struggle to wrest a living from the soil , of his bitter reverses and des - perate plights , of his eventual triumph over difficult conditions , and of his winning of the woman upon whom his heart is set .

		It is essentially one of the best of all stories , and both hero and heroine are of types that are perennially interesting because they are both strong and wholesome .

		The present variant of the story begins in
England	LOCATION	, but soon the char - acters are all transplanted oversea , and the plot enters upon its development .

		The hero has to con - tend , not only with the soil and the elements , but also with various forms of human malice and rascal - ity , and nothing but pluck and resourcefulness save him from going under .

		Thus the reader is kept in a constant state of tension , which is not disagreeable because his previous experience with the author assures him that there will be a bonanza harvest in the end , or a gold mine , or a fat contract , and that the hero 's honest determination will have its due reward , both material and sentimental .

		In his dealings with nature , as exhibited in that part of
America	LOCATION	which he has made his own , it seems to us that Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	is steadily growing in fineness of observation and power of description .

		It is impossible to take seriously such a novel as `` The Fashionable Adventures of
Joshua Craig	PERSON	. ''

		The straining for sensational effect and the deter - mination of the author to be startling at any cost are so obvious that the total result is repellent , and this quite apart from the commonness of the style and the unredeemed vulgarity of the treatment .

		Is it possible that Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	thinks his politician - hero an admirable person in any aspect of his char - acter or in any sense of the word ?

		A boor through and through , without any conception of the gracious side of life , he comes from the West into the political life of the capital , forces his way to high office by making himself a holy terror , elbows his way into polite society and acts like a bull in a china-shop , and finally captures a patrician wife by the primitive methods of the cave-dweller .

		We say `` patrician , '' because Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	clearly thinks that he is describ - ing the woman as of that type .

		This is the most amusing of all his miscalculations , for his heroine is also essentially a vulgarian , and the refinements with which he tricks her out do not long deceive us .

		Con - sidering the story as an extravaganza , it is rather good fun to follow the progress of the forceful
Josh	PERSON	, as he swings his club , and bowls over such lay figures of politicians and sybarites and dowagers as come within its destructive range .

		In the end , he refuses a position in the Cabinet , and drags his wife off to
Minnesota	LOCATION	, which is probably a good place in which to leave this precious pair .

		Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	, in his '' 54-40 or Fight , '' has become an adept in the '' big bow-wow '' style .

		This historical novel of two generations ago is simply reeking with the kind of patriotic sentiment that exuded from our old-time spokesmen of manifest destiny , whose mouthings were a mixture of blatant assertiveness , provincial prejudice , and lofty scorn of effete old-world examples .

		It tells of the period of our history when people of heated imaginations thought that
England	LOCATION	was intriguing with
Mexico	LOCATION	to bar our progress toward the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	, and was about to make war upon us for the possession of the
Oregon	LOCATION	country .

		The scene is laid first in
Wash	LOCATION	- ington , afterwards in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The figure of
Calhoun	ORGANIZATION	dominates the book , although a more youthful hero of the conventional sort is provided by his private secretary and trusted agent .

		Spice is added to the romance by the figure of an Austrian baroness , supposed to be in the pay of
England	LOCATION	, who flits from scene to scene , making unexpected appear - ances when needed .

		Respect for
Calhoun	ORGANIZATION	's demo - cratic simplicity and a sentimental attachment to his dashing young secretary finally win her to the American cause , and she becomes the chief instru - ment in effecting the boundary compromise .

		This success of petticoat diplomacy is unrecorded in his - tory , but it makes pretty material for Mr.
Hough	PERSON	's romantic purposes .

		The story has another heroine , of domestic origin , evidently intended for the hero after he has closed the chapter of his philanderings with the foreign adventuress , and we leave him in her possession when all misunderstandings are cleared away in the last chapter . ''

		The King of
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	, is a thrilling modern romance dealing with a Colo - rado feud .

		The quarrel results from the efforts of an irrigation company to construct works that will flood the lands and make useless the residence of a ranchman -- the fine old Southern gentleman who is

		THE DIAL 265 '' known as the King of
Arcadia	LOCATION	.

		The successive engineers engaged for the work all come to mys - terious or violent ends , and all sorts of suspicious accidents delay its progress .

		It seems as if the '' King '' were responsible for all these villainies , but we learn in the end that they are chargeable to a too zealous Mexican herdsman in his employ .

		The hero of this tale is the new engineer , who , undaunted by the fate of his predecessors , accepts the commis - sion , and does his best to make good .

		The heroine is the '' King 's '' daughter , who tries to be loyal to both lover and father , although for a time she also suspects the latter of criminal activities , charitably believing them to be the result of a disordered mind .

		After the reader has had his surfeit of explosions and land-slides and floods and sudden deaths , he ends in a love-feast , with explanations and reconciliations , while idyllic peace reigns over the whole situation .

		It all makes an entertaining , good-humored , and per - fectly superficial story , well supplied with dramatic incident , and told , for the most part , in a form of dialogue too smart to bear much relation to ordinary human speech . ''

		The Spell '' of Mr.
William Dana Orcutt	PERSON	's novel is that cast by the study of the Italian Renaissance upon the life of a young American scholar in Flor - ence .

		Just happily married , he has brought his wife to
Italy	LOCATION	, in order that he may combine intel - lectual delights with those of the honeymoon .

		Work - ing in the Laurentian library under the guidance of a famous Italian scholar whose identity is hardly concealed , he soon becomes so absorbed in his re - searches that his wife quite properly feels herself neglected .

		To make matters worse , the young woman whom she has invited to become a guest at their villa shares his interests and becomes the daily companion of his labors .

		Neither the man nor his companion realize the wrong they are doing , so interested do they become in their joint studies , so compelling is the spell of the old humanism which they are engaged in making their intellectual pos - session .

		Husband and wife at last stand upon the verge of permanent estrangement , when a fortunate automobile accident saves the situation by laying him up for some weeks , and bringing him to a wholesome realization of his unconscious neglect of an obvious duty .

		The spell is thus broken , and reality resumes the place of the dream that has usurped it .

		The novel is well written , and exhibits both artistic feeling and delicate analytical power ; its chief fault is that it lacks sufficient substance for a novel of its length .

Clarence F. Birdseye	PERSON	s volume on factories .

		`` The Reorganisation of our Col - leges '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the aggressive mode of their presentation , will stimulate discussion , seems a consummation both likely and desirable .

		.

		Much of the emphasis of the book is timely , and some of it commendable .

		The urgent need of rais - ing the social and moral standards and the general educational influences of the student 's environment ; , the need of restoring somehow the direct influence , of the teacher and the placing of the calling in its proper professional status ; the checking of the am - bitions of the colleges for numbers , and their showy forms of attaining publicity ; a more simple and effective supervision of the machinery of the college '' plant , '' -- in these and similar topics there is com - mon ground for the interchange of views and sug - gestions .

		But when so much is conceded , every discerning critic of educational processes who has the least appreciation of the conditions under which the fruits of the tree mature , must protest emphati - cally against the temper and trend of this ambitious ' volume .

		We are told repeatedly and variously that the college is a factory -- when it is not a depart - ment store ; that the methods of the great industries and of the trusts are the only ones that can save the situation ; that a separate department of administra - tion is what colleges need to save their souls and those of the '' problem-solvers '' and ' * citizen-thinkers '' committed to their charge .

		There is waste in the plant -LRB- doubtless there is -RRB- , and to discover it each student should be sent through the mill with a cost and production slip following him and telling in the end what he is worth .

		The analogy to the ends and means of a great business house is believed in to the logical finish .

		It is well that someone has ' the courage to carry this view to its extreme .

		But the position is more sad than ridiculous , and may become serious .

		When the volume reaches the hands of our foreign critics , some vigorous pronouncements may be expected ; and there is some consolation in the thought that the spirit of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	is beyond the reach of such offence .

		Not once in the course of four hundred pages is there a bit of proof that the conditions complained of are really in any way connected with the proposed remedy .

		The analogy is never under suspicion , though the vision is obstructed by motes and beams of all sorts and sizes .

		Surely it may be urged with greater force ' that the evils in question are due to just so much ' emphasis of administration and the business view as has already crept into our colleges ; that what we need is to save ourselves from any more of it , and to resist to the last the encroachments under way .

		The total aim and spirit and method of the college is foreign to that of the business world ; and that is just why we cherish it .

		It is easy for Mr.
Birdseye	PERSON	and his followers to say that he wants culture and 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, effective teaching and personality .

		K he really does , he must sacrifice everything to the spirit out of which such things grow ; and the spirit that gives such things life is to the spirit that must follow in the wake of his reorganized business-dominated college as
May	DATE	to
December	DATE	.

		The first requisite in the handling of intellectual interests is some appreciation of the forces that produce them and make their pur - suit worth while .

		To enter the arena of discussion without these is to raise the fundamental issue whether the end in view is worth the tremendous cost .

		For the reconstructed college -- or the present college in the view of the '' reconstructionists '' -- is logically not worth maintaining .

		Let the factories , the railroads , the banks , and the trusts , educate the youth of the land , and do it by business methods ; why bring in the college professor ?

		„ , , Although one might infer from the Austrian title ''
Napoleon	PERSON	and the Archduke campaigns .

		Charles , '' which Mr.
F. Loraine Petre	PERSON	gives to his volume on the campaign of
1809	DATE	, that it includes a large biographical element , the work is primarily an historical discussion of the
Ratisbon	PERSON	campaign and of the campaign of Essling-Wagram .

		Mr.
Petre	PERSON	has drawn new material from the corre - spondence in
Saski	LOCATION	's Campagne de
1809	DATE	, and from the papers of the Archduke
Charles	PERSON	.

		He believes that the English reader has had little opportunity to correct traditional misapprehensions , which had their origin in the efforts of that incomparable ad - vertiser ,
Napoleon	PERSON	himself , to propagate , by bulle - tins at the time , and later in his conversations at
St Helena	ORGANIZATION	, an account of his operations which should finally be accepted as orthodox .

		As in his previous volumes on the campaigns of
1806	DATE	and
1807	DATE	, the author begins with a full account of the organization and value of the two armies .

		He finds the strategy of the Ratisbon campaign over-praised , really at fault on more than one occasion , and markedly below the standard set by the compaign of
1806	DATE	.

		He thinks
Napoleon	PERSON	was influenced by a mistaken idea that
Vienna	LOCATION	was his true objective , rather than the Archduke 's army wherever it might go .

		He finds evidence that , until after the check at
Essling	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	underestimated the fighting qualities of the Austrians ; and this accounts for the contrast between the haste with which he made the first crossing of the Danube and the infinite pains with which he prepared for the second .

		One of the most curious features of the struggle was the influ - ence of the presence in the army of a large number of young recruits who should have been called in
1810	DATE	, and of half-trained men of previous classes , upon the manoeuvres on the field of battle .

		For example , the formation of
Macdonald	ORGANIZATION	's great column at
Wagram	LOCATION	, composed of thirty battalions in front with six in column behind the right and seven behind the left , is attributed to this cause .

		It was expected that such soldiers would be more stanch in heavy masses ; but this advantage was gained at terrible cost , for the column of
8000	DATE	was soon reduced to 1500 effectives .

		Among the author 's descriptions of bat - tles , the most successful is the account of Essling .

		With the description of the battles of the Ratisbon campaign , which are treated together , the principal diflBculty is the complex topography of the country over which the operations were carried , a difficulty which is not removed by the sketch-maps at the close of the volume .

		-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The pleasures ^ ^ * `` P ' '' * '' * delightful comradeship and pains of the with the undistinguished many , who toiling millions , ^ f ^ gp ^ 11 are the salt of the earth , Mr.
Richard Whiteing	PERSON	has written a score or more of short essays and sketches on unpretentious themes , and has called his book `` Little People '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		More than once he touches feelingly on that baffling mystery that has caused such bitterness of despair in many a Little Person 's breast , the seeming un - fairness of fortune , the inequality in the human lot . ''

		Why do our efficients , '' is his unanswerable ques - tion , '' demand such monstrous and altogether indi - gestible helps of the pride of life ?

		An opera singer warbles a few notes into the gramophone -- merely to clear his throat -- and is instantly dowered in royalties with a sum equivalent to a substantial an - nuity . ''

		The keynote to many a life-failure , as the world estimates failure , is struck in the account of a humble friend who '' began life thinking he was going to fail in it ... He had no sense of exist - ence as a struggle ; he dreamed of it as a thing that was all , more or less , an exchange of knightly offices -- foolish child !

		He generally muddled matters , and could not conceive of himself as clever or any - thing of the sort .

		He thought it would be delight - ful just to live , doing nice things and getting your share of nice things done in return -- exchanging good offices , in fact , as the Utopians of the story exchanged their washing . ''

		In admirable story - telling vein is a chapter entitled '' As a
March Hare	DATE	, '' describing the comical efforts of a well-meaning man to get himself shut up in a mad-house , in order to effect the release therefrom of a friend unjustly con - fined .

		On quite Chestertonic principles he at last succeeds , not by feigning madness , but by behaving with rigid regard to reason .

		Terseness of phrase and vigor of thought mark this book as they do not always succeed in marking the author 's novels .

		Readers of the latter should not fail to read '' Little People , '' if they desire a more intimate acquaintance with Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	at his best .

		, The publication of the several parts of Beginnings of , , o - - rrr i. ^ t '' i. > the greatest city the late Sir W alter
Besant	PERSON	s magnum , in the world .

		opus , ' the '' Survey of
London	LOCATION	, '' has been somewhat erratic .

		The first volume , appear - ing in
1903	DATE	, soon after the author 's death , was his ``
London	LOCATION	in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It was announced in this volume that the entire work was nearly ready for publication at the time of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's death .

		Other volumes have appeared at intervals , in the following order : ''
London	LOCATION	in the
Time	ORGANIZATION	of the Stuarts , '' ''
London	LOCATION	in the
Time	ORGANIZATION	of the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 267 Tudors , '' and two volumes on `` Mediaeval
London	LOCATION	. ''

		Now appears what might naturally be regarded as the initial volume of the series , `` Early
London	LOCATION	: Pre-Historic ,
Saxon	PERSON	and Norman '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , leav - ing a volume on Modern
London	LOCATION	to appear shortly and to complete what its busy author intended should be the great work of his life .

		In the volume now before us , Sir
Walter	PERSON	's account of Pre-historic
London	LOCATION	is prefaced by a chapter on the geology of the site , by Professor
T. G. Bonney	PERSON	, F.R.S. .

		This is in accordance with Sir
Walter	PERSON	's original scheme , which was to have certain phases of his exhaustive survey prepared by acknowledged experts in those special fields .

		This seems , however , the only in - tance in which he availed himself of such assist - ance , and the account of the city 's growth upon the unpromising site which is described in this first chapter is in
Sir Walter	LOCATION	's inimitable style .

		Paying all due attention to the tradition of the founding of Troynovant , or Trenovant , in the year
1108	DATE	B. c , he go ^ s on to collate all the available testimony regarding the earliest settlers and inhabitants of the forbidding spot upon which was destined to grow up the greatest city in the world , and gives us all that can be k '' own of Pre-historic
London	LOCATION	, augmenting his account with valuable appendices .

		The subsequent books on Roman ,
Saxon	LOCATION	, and
Norman London	PERSON	, bringing the survey down to the time of
Henry XL	ORGANIZATION	, are written in a similar style , alike erudite and pop - ular , making this volume full of interest to the student of topography as well as to the student of manners and customs .

		And this volume will , no less than the others , stimulate in whoever may look into its pages the same affectionate enthusiasm for the
London	LOCATION	of the remote past which its distin - guished author had for the
London	LOCATION	of every age of its history .

		A notable Text-books of embryology are much contribution too common to make the appearance to biology .

		^ f ^ jjg ^ Qjjg ^ g ^ gg ^ - j ^ event of particular scientific or literary significance .

		To attract any especial attention , a book of this kind must be markedly superior to others in the same general category .

		This requirement is well fulfilled by Professor
Lillie	PERSON	's recent work , '' The Develop - ment of the Chick ; an Introduction to Embryology '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		It has already taken the foremost place among existing accounts of the embryonic develop - ment of the chick , that '' never failing resource of the embryologist . ''

		The arrangement of the material and the plan of the book are in general much the same as in other embryological treatises , and embody the conventional ideas regarding the presentation of the subject to students .

		An introduction , dealing briefly with certain of the general biological prin - ciples on which any study of embryology depends , prepares the way for the detailed consideration of the course of the developmental processes in the chick .

		The account beg ^ ins with the formation of the egg , and follows this with the detailed descrip - tion of the development of the embryo and its organs
John Pettie	PERSON	, Scotch paintef day by day up to the time of hatching of the chick .

		All of this ground has of course been covered in other books .

		The superiority of the present work lies rather in the manner of treatment than in the matter discussed .

		What impresses one most in going through the volume is the thoroughness and pains - taking care with which the book has been prepared .

		Practically the whole of the work is based on the author 's own personal observations .

		The few minor inaccuracies of statement which the reviewer has noted have without exception been upon points where the author relied on some statement in the literature of the subject , rather than upon his own observations .

		The illustrations are nearly all original , and , from the standpoint of scientific illustrations , very fine .

		It is with real pleasure that one notes the absence of the hackneyed old figures that have done duty in so many text-books of embryology .

		Altogether , the work is a very notable contribution to the literature of elementary biology .

		`` No one will ever write my life , '' said
John Pettie	PERSON	; '' it has been much too uneventful . ''

		Nevertheless , fif - teen years after his death , he has found a biographer in his nephew .

		Mr.
Martin Hardie	PERSON	, who draws a delightful picture of the kindly , generous , tremen - dously forceful Scotch artist , and makes up for meagreness of biographical incident by fulness of descriptive matter about
Pettie	PERSON	's paintings .

		Diligent search through the artist 's note-books and in exhibi - tion and sale catalogues , as well as in correspondence or interviews with private owners of his work , has resulted in a practically complete catalogue , chron - ologically arranged .

		Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	barely remembers his artist uncle , but he has had many conversations with relatives and friends , as well as access to many letters , and from these he has reconstructed
Pettie	PERSON	's personality with almost the vividness of a first-hand portrayal .

		This is lavishly illustrated by remark - ably fine color-plates which go far to substantiate Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	's claims for his uncle 's talent as a colorist .

		Characteristic of Mr.
Pettie	PERSON	's indomitable perseverance was his resolve to conquer the prob - lems of color , which seemed harder for him than draughtsmanship . ''

		If other men become colorists by working ten hours a day , '' he declared , '' I '11 work twenty ! ''

		Both as an individual study and as a contribution to the history of Scotch art in the last century , Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	's biography , which is pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is well worth while .

		Duaiismin The lengthening Series of Mr.
Paul	PERSON	religion and .

		Elmer More s ``
Shelburne	LOCATION	Essays philosophy .

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- is beginning to assume proportions that make it not unnatural or unfit to compare these searching and scholarly disquisitions with the famous '' Causeries '' of Sainte-Beuve .

		For if he has made choice of any predecessor in the same department of literature as his model , the French essayist would seem to be the man .

		There are in each the same methodical and thorough working-up 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, of the subject chosen , the same effective intermin - gling of quotation and critical comment and illustra - tive allusion , and the same admirable command of the right turn of phrase with which to enforce the meaning ; and if the later writer displays somewhat less than the Frenchman 's acuteness and wit , he on the other hand draws upon a wider range of reading and thought and observation .

		His sixth volume , sub - titled '' Studies of Religious Dualism , '' takes up a half - score of subjects of enduring interest to scholars , -- the Forest Philosophy of
India	LOCATION	, the
Bhagavad Gita	PERSON	,
Saint Augustine	ORGANIZATION	,
Pascal	PERSON	, Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	,
Bunyan	PERSON	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Socrates	PERSON	, the Apology , and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three of the essays are now first published , and the others have been altered and considerably amplified in lifting from periodical to book .

		The writer is on congenial ground in these papers , the irreconcilable antinomies of existence presenting for him , as for all meditative minds , a fascinating though teasing and not over-fruitful subject for thought .

		A shade too much of oriental fatalism and pessimism is inclined to color the utterances of him who lingers unduly in this boundless domain of unanswered and unanswerable inquiry .

		That the high standard of the series is here maintained , if not indeed raised even higher , goes almost without saying .

		Readers of the earlier volumes can not afford to neglect this latest .

		„ , ■ , Five short and readable , as well as Some colonial i - i i i ■ i • characters in scholarly and pamstaking , chapters lifelike attitudes , from our colonial history make up `` The Apprenticeship of
Washington	LOCATION	, and Other Sketches of Significant Colonial Personages '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
George Hodges	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, D.C.L. Written by a descendant of both the Pil - grims and the Puritans , though himself a minister of the Church in protest against which his ancestors migrated to this country , these sketches have the freshness of a rather new point of view , while at the same time they show a large-raindedness and fairness that must win the approval and sympathy of all readers .

		Besides the title-chapter , there are accounts of `` The Hanging of
Mary Dyer	PERSON	, '' '' The Adventures of Captain
Myles Standish	PERSON	, '' `` The Education of
John Harvard	PERSON	, '' and `` The Forefathers of
Jamestown	LOCATION	. ''

		A genial and sometimes quietly humorous style makes the book excellent reading .

		In referring to the ancient and honored stories of
Washington	LOCATION	's boy - hood , the author is restrained by no reverence for
Parson Weems	ORGANIZATION	's sacred calling from demonstrating his untruthfulness . ''

		The talk which goes on between the lad -LSB-
George Washington	PERSON	-RSB- and the father , '' he asserts , `` is as far removed from reality as the con - ferences between
Adam	PERSON	and Eve which are reported by
John Milton	PERSON	. ''

		The writer 's tone of fairness in treating our religious history may be illustrated by a single short sentence from the chapter on
Mary Dyer	PERSON	: '' The followers of the Inward Light have always been obnoxious to the established order '' ; he understands but does not share `` the instinctive irrita - tion and enmity of the conservative mind against the person who claims to talk with God . ''

		Dean
Hodges	PERSON	has made a valuable , and at the same time quite unpretentious , contribution to our historical literature .

		It is the work of Mr.
Louis James Block	PERSON	, a Chicagfo educator and author , and is described as a symbolic production , the scenes being laid in
Modena	LOCATION	in the fourteenth century , a prose prologue and epilogue connecting the theme with modern conditions .

		`` The Revelation to the
Monk of Evesham Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, '' a work which dates from
1196	DATE	, is done into modem English by Mr.
Valerian Paget	PERSON	, and published by the
John McBride Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was first printed on the Continent in
1482	DATE	, and a unique copy of that edition is preserved in the British Museum .

		Professor
Arber	PERSON	has reprinted it in our own time , and now we have a modernized ver - sion of this extremely interesting product of the mediae - val religious spirit .

		The bibliography of '' State Publications , '' begun ten years ago by Mr ,
R. R. Bowker	PERSON	, has just been com - pleted in the publication of Part IV. , comprising The
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		The wealth of information , -- his - torical , statistical , descriptive , and scientific , hidden , because of imperfect bibliographical record , in the pub - lications of the several States qf the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	, is second only to that in the publications of the Gov - ernment , which also until recent years had been poorly recorded and inadequately known .

New York	LOCATION	. ''

		The Letters of Percy
Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	, '' collected and edited by Mr.
Roger Ingpen	PERSON	, is an important announce - ment of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The collection consists of about 450 letters gathered from every avail - able source -- some of which have only been printed privately in a strictly limited issue ; while many have not appeared in print before .

		Indeed , the largest number of Shelley letters previously printed in one collection amounts only to 127 .

		The letters are printed in chron - ological form , are annotated , and fully indexed .

		The illustrations comprise a unique collection of portraits of
Shelley	PERSON	and his friends , and views of the places where he lived , besides facsimiles of his

Francis Marion Crawford	PERSON	.


Francis Marion Crawford	PERSON	died on the
evening	TIME	of
April 9	DATE	in his villa at
Sorrento	LOCATION	.

		His death was un - timely , for he had not completed his fifty-fifth year .

		His life was spent largely out of doors , and was filled with healthy activities .

		He should have been good for another score of years , and this thought is an added grief to the host of his friends .

		He was an American in ancestry and spirit , although the greater part of his life was spent abroad .

		Born in
Italy	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	, he got his education successively in his native country , the
United States	LOCATION	, the Universities of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Karlsruhe	LOCATION	,
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		This training marked him out for a cosmopolitan , and few other American writers have had interests that ranged so freely over the whole civilized world .

		Thrown upon his own resources at the age of twenty-four , he essayed literary work in
India	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, and in
1882	DATE	conceived the happy thought of writing a novel .

		This was '' Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	, '' the first of the long series , and its success was immediate and pronounced .

		His voca - tion was now determined , and was pursued with unflag - ging industry for the twenty-seven remaining years of his life .

		He wrote more than forty books , two-thirds of them novels , and became one of the most popular of our writers .

		The fluency of his pen was in a sense his misfortune , for no one can write as much as he did and at the same time realize his highest possibilities .

		His books are workmanlike and entertaining , but excessively diluted with rather commonplace philosophizing , and the best of them fall short of distinction .

		He was at his best in the delineation of Italian life and character , and the highest mark of his achievement was probably reached in the `` Saracinesca '' trilogy of novels .

		He also made important studies in Italian history , and the books resulting from these studies are almost as read - able and entertaining as his books of fiction .

		MESSRS. HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY BEG TO ANNOUNCE THAT AFTER MANY DELAYS INCIDENT TO PREPARATION AND PRINTING , THE RIVERSIDE PRESS EDITION OF
AUGUSTE BERNARD	PERSON	'S LIFE OF GEOFROY TORY , TRANSLATED BY
GEORGE B. IVES	PERSON	, IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY .

		C Aside from its interest as an important contribution to the his - tory of engraving and typography , it will have a special appeal for those who have followed the work of Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	, for no other volume in the series has been given closer study , more careful scrutiny , or greater wealth of treatment in design .

		The edition is printed from the
Riverside Caslon	PERSON	, a type re-cut espe - cially for it by Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	, from original
Caslon	PERSON	letters .

		This new face harmonizes admirably with the spirit and feeling of Tory 's crisp and sparkling designs , which are the chief raison d'etre of this publication .

		Some of these designs are familiar to readers of the several monographs on the subject , but many have been taken from original sources and are here reproduced for the first time .

		A world without poets -- such , it seems , is the world in which we are henceforth to live , now that the last singer of the great line has left us .

		The Victorian glory was still ours as long as a single figure remained of the group that made the Victorian age memorable ; its sun has now set indeed , and there are no signs of a new sunrise to compare with that which flooded the heavens with light half a century or more ago .

		On the fifth of
April	DATE	Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	rounded out his seventy-second year ; five days later he had drawn his last breath .

		The '' youngest singer '' of the exquisite tribute paid in
1864	DATE	to
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's memory had gradually , as his great contemporaries one by one passed away , himself come to be '' the oldest singer that
England	LOCATION	bore , '' and the opening of the Twen - tieth century had revealed him standing in soli - tary preeminence , the sole poet of the first rank left to
England	LOCATION	, almost to the world .

		Now that he is gone , the best of those that remain seem ephemera , idle singers of empty days , voices ineffectual and unresonant .

		We must accept the situation .

		The whole inheritance of past English poetry is stiU ours , for counsel and in - spiration ; but new occasions , as they bring us new obligations and new needs , will find no poet to transmute their dross into spirit-gold by his wonder-working alchemy .

		A later generation will , we make no doubt , do Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	more substantial justice than has been done him by his contemporaries .

		Higher rank it can hardly give him than that already accorded by those who have really known his work in its entirety , but it is sure to bring a more wide-spread recognition than they have hitherto enjoyed of those superb qualities of profound thought and imaginative expression that are characteristic of his genius .

		By a very large part of the public , even of the public that genuinely cares for poetry , he is still thought of in the terms of a tradition that was fixed upon him in his early years , a tradition so distorted from the truth as to be nothing less than gro - tesque .

		Many people still , in sheer simplicity of ignorance , imagine wordiness and sensuality to be the essential attributes of his work .

		This estimate , as we have said elsewhere , '' is a com 282 THE DIAL -LSB- Mayl , posite of hearsay , of superficial acquaintance with a few of the strays of his work , and of a legend based upon the sensational journalism of more than a generation ago . ''

		The charge of verbosity results from the fact that Swinburne '' does not fling his learning at the reader in undigested lumps , but subordinates the exhibi - tion to the strictest law of artistic expression . ''

		As for the charge of sensualism , we can only say that to those who know him ,
Swinburne	PERSON	is '' the poet who almost more than any of his fellow-singers exalts spirit above sense , and transports his readers into an atmosphere almost too rarefied for ordinary mortals to breathe . ''

		We urge these considerations , as we have many times urged them before , because in much that has been written about the poet even since his death the old stereotyped formulae have been applied to him , and the old ignorance of the totality of his production has been displayed .

		The perfunctory critic of Swinburne always begins by exalting him to the skies as a mel - odic wizard and artist in rhythmical effects , and then proceeds to deplore his morbid tendencies , his vacuity of thought , and his uncritical enthu - siasms .

		But all that was morbid in the '' Poems and Ballads '' of
1866	DATE	had been sloughed off , like a disease of youth , when the '' Songs before Sunrise '' were published in
1871	DATE	, and Swin - burne has revealed himseK in many a subsequent volume of verse and prose both as a profound scholar and as a severe and serious thinker upon the gravest problems that confront the human intellect .

		As for his enthusiasms -LRB- and preju - dices -RRB- , while we may admit that they are at times expressed with a vehemence that tends to weaken their effect , we must in all fairness admit also that they are supported by a wealth of knowledge and a cogency of reasoning that usually justify them in substance if not in form .

		There are few matters of judgment , literary or historical , moral or philosophical , in which he was not fundamentally right , and in face of that fact there is no cause for serious censure in the other fact that his pronouncements were colored by his temperament in a very unusual degree .

		Artificial restraint , and the affectation of a severely judicial manner , are qualities that do not contribute to the vis viva of criticism ; the qualities of exuberance and emotion have also their legitimate place , unless we deny to the art any element of the persuasive function .

		The amount of
Swinburne	PERSON	's work is very great , and a large part of it has never been made easily accessible to the public , -- a fact which accounts in considerable measure for the uninformed attitude toward it of the general reader .

		The volumes are about twoscore in number , many of them almost prohibitive in price , and some of them long out of print .

		Even the new collected edition fills eleven volumes , and includes none of the prose writings , which would fill as many more of equal size .

		Most people who claim acquaintance with
Swinburne	PERSON	will be found , upon inquiry , to know little of him beyond the contents of the
1866	DATE	volume of `` Poems and Ballads '' that brought him notoriety rather than fame .

		The great odes , the magnificent series of lyrics dedicated to the cause of human freedom , the matchless elegies , the touching personal tributes , the tender songs of childhood , the superb narrative poems , and the noble sonnets , are alike unfamiliar to those who prate most confidently about his sound and fury , his undisciplined emotionalism , and his fleshly leanings .

		For a hundred who glibly quote '' Dolores '' and ''
Laus Veneris	PERSON	, '' there is hardly one who knows ''
Athens	LOCATION	'' and '' Thalassius '' and '' The Armada '' and '' The Last
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' By the North Sea '' and '' Songs before Sunrise . ''

		Yet these are the works which make him one of the greatest of English poets ; the others are youthful indiscretions that we might easily spare .

		The dramatic poems of
Swinburne	LOCATION	's ripest creative period have suffered similar neglect . ''

		Atalanta in Calydon '' is well known ; the far nobler '' Erechtheus '' is ignored .

		The exuberant '' Chastelard '' was borne into favor upon the wave of the author 's popularity when he made his startling appearance in the world of letters ; '' BothweU '' and ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, '' by reason of the very restraint and severity of their art , have not found one-tenth as many readers , although they are incomparably finer productions .

		The average student of our literature who is asked to name the author of ''
Marino Faliero	PERSON	' '' will speak of
Byron	PERSON	and learn with surprise that we owe to
Swinburne	PERSON	a far greater treatment of the same theme .

		As for '' Locrine '' and ''
Rosamund	PERSON	, '' they are known to very few read - ers indeed .

		We do not expect the closet drama to become widely popidar under the present conditions of literary taste , but the greatest masterpieces in this kind that our age has pro- duced are deserving of more recognition than they have thus far obtained .

		They represent , in
Swinburne	LOCATION	's case , about half of his total achievement as a poet , and they may possibly prove to be the more enduring half .

		If
Swinburne	PERSON	had given us no poetry at all , his prose alone would have distinguished him ,1909 . -RSB-

		THE DIAJ ^ 283 as one of the most forceful writers of his time .

		It is prose of the most extraordinary richness and flexibility , concerned chiefly with the study of literature , but illuminating its judgments with a wealth of allusions drawn from the whole realm of the intellectual life .

		More evidently than his poetry , it refutes the laughable notion that
Swinburne	PERSON	was without scholarship or the capacity for serious thought .

		In style it is far from admirable , being tortuous and involved , but those who thread its labyrinthine passages will be amply rewarded for their pains .

		The prose writings include special studies of Shake - speare ,
Jonson	PERSON	,
Chapman	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	, and Hugo , besides a volume on the Elizabethan dramatists , three volumes of miscellaneous essays , and sev - eral smaller books .

		They give us criticism of the most vital and penetrating sort , criticism that does not always satisfy the scientific fac - ulty , but that always succeeds in kindling the soul .

		A uniform collected edition of these prose writings is greatly to be desired .


Algernon Charles Swinburne	PERSON	was born of aristocratic parentage on
April 5,1837	DATE	.

		He was educated at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and Balliol , but left
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	without taking a degree .

		His first book was published in
1860	DATE	, and the year after he made the visit to
Italy	LOCATION	which won for him
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's friendship , and did much to determine the current of his poetical inspiration .

		The years 1865-6 were the years in which '' Atalanta '' and the '' Poems and Ballads '' took an aston - ished world by storm .

		Practically the whole of his manhood life was spent in
London	LOCATION	, the
last thirty years	DATE	of it in the suburb of
Putney	LOCATION	, where he lived in the companionship of las closest friend , Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	, and where he died on the tenth of
last month	DATE	.

		The comradeship thus ended is one of the most beautiful in literary history , and we trust that the surviving member of the household at '' The Pines '' may be prevailed upon to let the world into some of the secrets of the intimate relation that so long existed between the two friends .

		R USSEA U THE VA GABOND . ''

		The thing that I most regret among the details of my life of which I have lost the memory is that I did not keep a journal of my travels , '' says
Rousseau	PERSON	; and this regret every reader of the '' Confessions '' has shared .

		The greatest of sentimentalists was also the prince of vagabonds -- the inventor ,
Sainte	PERSON	- Beuve affirms , of le voyage pedestre .

		The stream of the '' Confessions , '' too often turbid with distressing or shameful things , flows sometimes clean and fresh and sparkling through lovely levels , or lies quiet for a moment in deep and shady pools .

		Such is the de - scription of the journey that he made with his friend Bade from
Turin	LOCATION	to
Annecy	LOCATION	.

		He was eighteen , the protege of the Count de Gouvon , who was evidently ready to make the fortune of the homeless and pen - niless young adventurer .

		But Bade , the droll , the gay , the amusing , was about to walk to
Geneva	LOCATION	.

		Rousseau remembered how delightful had been the journey to
Turin	LOCATION	.

		In his thoughts , '' The mountains , the meadows , the woods , the streams , the villages succeeded one another without end and always with new charms .

		What would it he when , to the joy of independence , should be added that of travelling with a good-humored comrade of my own age and taste , without worry , duty , constraint , or obligation to go on or stop , except as we liked ?

		One must be mad to sacrifice such luck to ambitious plans that are sl ` ow , difficult , and uncertain of execution , and which , supposing them to be one day realized , would not in all their splendor be worth a quarter of an hour of true pleasure and freedom in youth . ''

		Only he who has no vagabondage in his soul will deny this ; and
Rousseau	PERSON	never did .

		In spite of the suffering of mind and body that clouded the greater part of his life , he never had occasion to lament that his youth was dead within him .

		And so the two lads set out , their purses `` lightly fur - nished , '' but their hearts '' saturated with joy , thinking only of enjoying this wayfaring bliss , '' cette amhulante felicitS .

		They took with them a mechanical toy which was to help them get their living on the road , and allow them to prolong their travels indefinitely .

		WhUe this expectation proved to be ill-founded , the journey was almost as delightful as they had hoped ; and one regrets with
Rousseau	PERSON	that he kept no detailed record of it .

		One regrets still more that there is no journal of his travels , this time on horseback , as secretary and interpreter to the '' Greek archimandrite '' who was seeking funds to rebuild the Holy Sepulchre .

		Wan - dering one day in the country about
Neuchatel	LOCATION	, where he was teaching music , he entered an inn at Boudry to dine .

		There he '' saw a man with a great beard , a violet coat of Greek fashion , a fur cap , and a suffi - ciently noble appearance and beai-ing , '' who was struggling to make himself understood in Italian .

		The young musician , with an eye for adventure , came to the rescue , joined the prelate at dinner , '' and at the end of the meal we were inseparable . '' ''

		With - out precaution , assurance , or knowledge , I gave myself up to his guidance -- and behold me , the next day , on my way to Jerusalem ! ''

		The end of this romanesque adventure was worthy of the begin - ning .

		After making , before the senate of
Berne	LOCATION	, the only good speech of his life , in his capacity as spokesman for the archimandrite , he was arrested at Soleure with his principal .

		The Greek disappears from the story ; but
Rousseau	PERSON	, as usual , finds friends , who send him with a hundred francs in his pocket to seek his fortune at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He writes : '' I gave to this journey a fortnight , which I can coant among the happy days of my life .

		I was young , I was strong , I had enough money and much hope .

		I was travel - ling on foot , and alone .

		You might be surprised at my 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, oonnting this an advantage if you were not already familiar - with my humor .

		My sweet fancies -LRB- chimeres -RRB- kept me com - pany , and never did the heat of my imagination produce more magnificent ones ... This time my ideas were mar - tial .

		... I fancied that I saw myself already in an officer 's coat and a fine white plume .

		My heart swelled at this noble idea ... However , as I came into the pleasant fields and saw the groves and brooks , this touching sight made me sigh with regret ; I felt in the midst of my glory that my heart was not made for so much tumult ; and soon , without knowing how , I found myself back among my dear sheep - folds , renouncing forever the toils of Mars . ''

		Few as these journeys were , a complete vaga - bond 's manual may be compiled from the '' Confes - sions '' and illustrated from the temperament of its author .

		All the peculiar gifts and graces of the wanderer were his .

		The joys of the road at their purest and keenest he knew , and sang them in a prose that is all but lyrical .

		He was incorrigibly young , hopeful , imaginative .

		Wherever he was , he tells us , it was never far to the nearest Castle in
Spain	LOCATION	; though his castles not seldom proved to have material foundations .

		He delighted in the open country and its life , and in the simplicity and friend - liness of humble folk .

		His temper always remained essentially rustic and unsophisticated , even after years of intimacy with the great .

		Beauty of land - scape appealed , of course , to a * taste that was in the strictest sense romantic . ''

		I love to walk at my ease and to stop when I like .

		The wayfaring life , la vie ambulante , is what I demand .

		To make my way on foot , in fine weather , in a beautiful coun - try , without haste , and to have an agreeable object as my goal , this is the manner of life that is most to my taste .

		Moreover , you know already what I mean by beautiful country .

		Never did flat country , liowever beautiful , appear so to my eyes .

		I demand torrents , rocks , pines , black forests , mountains , rough roads to climb and descend , fearful preci - pices beside me . ''

		It is the younger
Pliny	PERSON	, who says -LRB- of a boar-hunt , to be sure -RRB- that bodily activity stimulates the mind ; and
Hazlitt	PERSON	is of the same opinion . ''

		Give me , '' he writes , `` the clear blue sky over my head , and the green turf under my feet , a winding road before me , and a three hours ' march to dinner -- and then to thinking !

		It is hard if I can not start some game on these lone heaths . ''


Stevenson	PERSON	, the idler , dis - sents .

		His ideal is an '' open-air drunkenness '' that lays thought asleep , '' that fine intoxication that ... begins in a sort of dazzle and sluggishness of the brain , and ends in a peace that passes comprehen - sion . ''

		But
Rousseau	PERSON	is of
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	's mind , and
Haz	PERSON	- litt 's .

		He writes : '' Never have I thought so much , existed so much , lived so much , been so much myself , as in those -LSB- journeys -RSB- that I have made alone and on foot .

		Walking , somehow , animates and kindles my ideas .

		I can hardly think , when I remain in one place .

		My body has to be in motion to start my mind .

		The view of the country , the succession of pleasant sights , the open air , the good appetite , the good health that I gain by walking , the freedom of an inn , the separation from everything that makes me feel my dependence , that recalls to me my situation , all this frees my soul , gives me a greater boldness of thought , throws me , somehow , into the immensity of things , to combine them , choose them , appro - priate them at will , without embarrassment and without fear .

		Like a master , I dispose of all nature .

		My heart , wandering from object to object , unites , identifies itself with those that please it , surrounds itself with charming images , becomes intoxicated with delicious feelings .

		If , in order to fix them , I amuse myself by mentally describing them , what vigor of pencil , what freshness of tint , what energy of expression I give them !

		I am told that people have found all this in my works , even though written in my declining years .

		Ah , if they had seen those of my first youth , those that I made on my journeys -- composed and never wrote !

		Why not have written them ?

		you ask .

		And I reply .

		Why should I have written them ?

		Why deprive myself of the actual charm of enjoyment in order to tell others what I had enjoyed ?

		What mattered to me , readers , a public , on the earth , while I was soaring in the heavens ?

		Besides , did I carry pens and paper with me ?

		If I had thought of all that , nothing would have come to me .

		I did not foresee that I should have ideas .

		They come when they please , not when I please .

		They do not come at all , or they come in a crowd , overwhelming me with their number and their power .

		Ten volumes a day would not have sufficed .

		Where should I have found time to write them ?

		When I arrived , I thought only of dinner .

		When I went away , I thought only of a good walk .

		I felt that a new paradise awaited me at the door .

		I thought only of going to seek it . ''

		It is from revelations like this that we learn whence
Rousseau	PERSON	drew the breadth and freshness of his thinking , where he found '' the first fine care - less rapture '' of his style .

		Into his books passed the simplicity , the passion , the serenity , the spon - taneity of nature .

		He became one of her voices ; through him she spoke to an urban cultivated society that sorely needed his ministrations .

		He had much of her frankness , too , her lack of shame , her toler - ance for the unclean .

		The '' Confessions '' is not the work of a fastidious man .

		It has no touch of the Rabelaisian temper , or of
Sterne	PERSON	's complacent indecency .

		It speaks of tacenda , sometimes , to be sure , with physical disgust , but , on the whole , with a humorous acquiescence and a freedom from severity that are
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's own .

		One touch in the passage last quoted is the very mark and sign manual of the vagabond , '' the separa - tion from everything that makes me feel my depend - ence . '' ''

		Oh ! ''

		cries
Hazlitt	PERSON	, '' it is great to shake off the trammels of the world and of public opinion -- to lose our importunate , tormenting , everlasting personal identity in the elements of nature , and become the creature of the moment , clear of all ties . ''

		Without this , what were youth and hope and imagination and a taste for the picturesque ?

		If one must intrude upon boon Nature his petty cares for the morrow , he had better stick to his desk and copy his music to the end of his days .

		But if one can set forth as
Rousseau	PERSON	did , with only his dear chi - meres for provision , to enter `` the vast space of the world , '' confident that his merit will fill it ; if , friend - less in a strange city , one can regard twenty francs as an inexhaustible fortune , and dine superlatively well for five or six sous ; if , absolutely without resource in
Paris	LOCATION	, one can abandon oneself tran - quilly to one 's indolence and the care of
Providence	LOCATION	, and , in order to give Him time to do His work , proceed to devour without haste one 's few remain - ing louis , going to the play only twice a week , -- if one can do these rare things , then one is indeed sealed of the tribe of vagabonds forevermore .

		There is a passage in the '' Confessions '' that should be
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 made a test of fitness for all who aspire to initiation .

		Rousseau is at
Lyons	PERSON	with little money and no friends , when he writes : '' I preferred to spend the few sous that remained to me on bread rather than on shelter , because after all I was less in danger of dying for lack of sleep than for lack of food .

		The astonishing thing is that in this cruel state I was neither disturbed nor sad .

		I had not the least care for the future , and I awaited the answer that
Madame de Chatelet	ORGANIZATION	was to receive , lying down under the stars , and sleeping stretched out on the earth or on a bench as quietly as on a bed of roses .

		I remember even having passed a delicious night outside the city , on a road that ran beside the Rhone or the
Saone	LOCATION	, I do not remember which .

		Terraced gardens bor - dered the road on the opposite side .

		The day had been very warm .

		The evening was charming .

		The dew moistened the dried grass .

		There was no wind .

		The night was still .

		The air was fresh without being cold .

		The sun , at its setting , had left in the sky red vapors whose reflection turned thei water rose-color .

		The trees of the terrace were filled with nightingales answering one another .

		I walked along in a sort of ecstasy , abandoning my senses and my heart to the joy of it all , and breathing only a sigh of regret that I was enjoying it alone .

		Absorbed in my sweet reverie , I pro- longed my walk far into the night without noticing that I was tired .

		At last I perceived it .

		I lay down voluptuously on the tablet of a kind of niche or false door sunk in a ter - race waU .

		Tree-tops formed the canopy of my bed .

		A nightingale was exactly above me .

		I went to sleep as he was singing .

		My sleep was sweet , my waking sweeter .

		It was broad day .

		As I opened my eyes , I saw the water , the verdure , an admirable landscape .

		I rose , shook myself .

		Hunger seized me , and I made my way gaily toward the town , resolved to spend on a good breakfast two pieces de six blancs that still remained to me .

		I was in such good humor that I went singing along the way . ''

		The song procured him , as usual , a dinner and a friend .

		Let all presumptive Knights of the Road read this -- and emulate it if they can .

		Though there is doubtless a touch of self-com - placency in
Rousseau	PERSON	's repeated allusions to his own indifference to money , he gave unmistakable proofs that the indifference was genuine .

		It was not that he simplified his life in accordance with a theory .

		His life was naturally simple and his wants few .

		To borrow
Richard Holt Hutton	PERSON	's fine phrase , he had
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' spiritual frugality . ''

		His pleas - ures were for the most part the rudimentary joys of men , though , being
Rousseau	PERSON	and a sentimentalist , he made some demands of life that are not rudi - mentary : the perfection of friendship , for example , to choose an instance that is quite discreet .

		Through the whole unhappy story of his relations with men and women , though it is quite evident that he was a difficult friend , it is equally evident that he gave a far greater measure of devotion than he ever re - ceived ; and late in life we find him , pathetically enough , expressing the fear that in making friend - ship the idol of his heart , he had spent his life in sacrificing to chimeres .

		Yet , after all , the funda - mental
Rousseau	PERSON	is the ^
Rousseau	PERSON	of the following passage , which describes the beginning of his life with Th ^ rese : '' If our pleasures could be described , their siiftplicity would make you laugh : our walks together out of town , in the course of which I magnificently spent eight or ten sous at some public house ; our little suppers at the casement of my window , seated opposite each other on two little chairs placed on a trunk that filled the width of the embrasure .

		In this situation , the window served as a table , we breathed the air , we could see our surroundings , and the passers-by .

		... Who will describe , who will feel the charm of these suppers , composed only of a quarter-loaf of coarse bread , some cherries , a bit of cheese , and a half setter of wine , which we both drank ?

		Friendship , confidence , intimacy , gentle - ness of soul , how delicious is your seasoning !

		Sometimes we remained there till
midnight	TIME	, without suspecting the hour . ''

		This is the
Rousseau	PERSON	who introduced into French literature what Sainte-Beuve calls '' the sentiment of domestic life . ''

		And while this sentiment is not ordinarily associated in our minds with vagabond tastes , in
Rousseau	PERSON	's case the two instincts were naturally and closely connected .

		A man who took his pleasure so frugally , who got so much from so little , provided only that it was seasoned with friend - ship and intimacy , who had an inexhaustible interest in people of all classes , and an evident faculty of winning their interest and confidence in return , such a man is at home anywhere , and finds `` the senti - ment of domestic life '' in even more unexpected places than a fourth floor apartment in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He found it , for example , in the unfurnished lazaretto at
Genoa	LOCATION	, where he spent two weeks quite alone , while the vessel on which he had sailed to
Italy	LOCATION	was in quarantine .

		He tells us that he made a bed of his clothing , used his trunks for chair and table , arranged his paper , inkstand , and a dozen books , and declared himself absolutely comfortable .

		In spite of the self-consciousness that lurks in the nar - rative , it is refreshingly free from any assumption of Spartan virtue .

		Being a man of simple tastes , he good-humoredly makes the best of circumstances .

		Why pose as a philosopher ?

		Except so far as a diseased imagination fettered his free spirit , he was the prince of vagabonds to the end of his days , -- `` a chartered libertine . ''

		When at forty he '' determined to pass in independence and poverty the little time that remained to live , '' he pro- ceeded to lay aside forever everything that seemed to him inconsistent with his chosen manner of life .

		As he sold his watch , he exclaimed : '' Thank Heaven , I shall never again need to know what time it is ! ''

		Of all possible reflections on the occasion , this is surely the most characteristic of the vagabond temper .


Charles H. A. Wager	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		French impressions of American news - papers , of which we have already given a sample or two , are not always wholly favorable .

		M.
Emile Deschamps	PERSON	, writing in '' La Revue , '' stigmatizes our daily press as inferior in literary quality , lacking or - derly arrangement in make-up , and unduly devoted to the interests of advertisers and advertisement - readers .

		Some of his strictures are undeniably wholesome .

		In
France	LOCATION	, we are told , writing is an art ; but in
America	LOCATION	people write as they talk . ''

		Style is in disgrace ; it is accused of retarding or obscuring or wholly masking the thought .

		Accord - 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ing to the Americans , we Frenchmen waste precious time in word-hunting .

		Euphony counts for nothing with them ; it is not appreciated . ''

		Again , the higgledy-piggledy arrangement of matter in our newspapers is censured , as it should be .

		Who has not been driven to the verge of wicked language by the difficulty of finding a news item or other article that he has reason to believe is somewhere in the paper , or that he has himself already seen and wishes to consult again ?

		The editorials constitute about the only matter that one feels reasonably sure of being able to find readily . ''

		But these trifling items , '' continues the critic after some pretty gener - ous slashing , '' are as nothing compared with the great trashiness of American journalism .

		Trash you may find in the newspapers of all countries , but in this respect the land of Uncle
Sam	PERSON	-LRB- and of the canard -RRB- leads all the rest . ''

		However , a word of comfort and of hope is vouchsafed us at the very end .

		Journalism is in endless evolution , '' and while the French press seems at present to feel the influence of American exuberance , the American press is here and there developing a tendency to conform to the standards of European journalism . ''

		But the sal - vation of the newspaper must be sought in raising `` the intellectual lever of the public it addresses . ''

		• • • A FREE LIBRARY FREELY USED presents an agree - able spectacle to gods and men , especially to that portion of the latter who are connected with its management .

		The
Free Public Library of East Orange	ORGANIZATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, is conducted on principles of exceeding liberality , and is used , not abused , by a notably large proportion of the denizens of that fair city .

		Some items of significance arrest the eye in the library 's Sixth Annual Report .

		Mr.
James Duff Brown	PERSON	, the well-known
London	LOCATION	librarian , recently called attention to the large proportion of book - borrowers in
East Orange	LOCATION	.

		That proportion last year -LRB- excluding `` dead registration '' and counting only the actual borrowers within the twelve months -RRB- was nearly one-third of the entire population -- a fraction far larger than the greater cities can report .

		In freedom of borrowing the
East Orangeites	LOCATION	are unusually favored : with the exception of current fiction , works in special demand , and recent period - icals , they are allowed to draw at one time as many books as they wish and to keep them as long as any reasonable person could possibly wish -- four weeks , with privilege of renewal if not called for by anyone else .

		Even reference books , those fixtures of most library reading-rooms , '' may be borrowed for over night , or over
Sunday	DATE	, as at such times no one is deprived of their use . ''

		A telephone inquiry depart - ment , similar to that at Cardiff which we recently described , is in successful operation , and has answered questions of an astonishing amplitude of range .

		Fin - ally , and this is the most admirable of all , the readers themselves do a large part of the book-selecting and book-reviewing required for intelligent purchase of new works . ''

		Co-operation is the order of the day , '' observes the librarian . ''

		Why should it not be applied in a city 's library ? ''

		Happy indeed is that city whose citizens number such competent critics as appear to be found in considerable numbers in
East Orange	LOCATION	.

		The duplication of book-titles has given rise to some correspondence , aggrieved or expostulatory on the one side , and apologetic on the other , in an English literary journal .


Canon Vaughan	ORGANIZATION	permits himself to feel a little injured because Mr.
S. C. Gayford	PERSON	has written a book and named it `` Life After Death , '' regardless of the earlier appearance of a work thus entitled from the
Canon	ORGANIZATION	's pen .

		Mr.
Gayford	PERSON	avers in self-defense that he was utterly unaware of this earlier book 's existence -- which perhaps makes his crime all the blacker in
Canon Vaughan	ORGANIZATION	's eyes .

		A recent book bears the not strik - ingly original title , '' The End of the Middle Age , '' and Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	takes occasion to remind the public , but in no injured tone of voice , that some years ago he published a book by Mme.
Duclaux	PERSON	called `` The End of the Middle Ages . ''

		It is a puzzling question how far the moral copyright -LRB- legal copyright would seem to be out of the question -RRB- ought to extend in protection of exclusive rights to titles .

		A recent `` Atlantic '' article has acquainted us with the far-sighted self-interest of a successful soap - manufacturer in preempting , by legal means , some hundreds of attractive and desirable names for soap , thus excluding much dangerous rivalry .

		Titles for future novels no popular writer has yet seriously demanded the privilege of appropriating , to the embarrassment of his fellow-novelists ; and only very distinctive and original titles could put forth any plausible claim for protection .

		But as books mul - tiply and the domain of unused names suffers increasing shrinkage , the question here touched upon may become something more than a purely academic one .

		• • .

		The advertising of '' fake '' books and book - schemes is usually done through circulars and the lower order of periodicals ; but frequently , we are sorry to say , it appears in otherwise reputable maga - zines .

		We noted recently in '' Current Literature '' a full-page announcement headed , in large type , ''
Stevenson	PERSON	's Complete Works at a Bargain . ''

		The phrase '' complete works '' is repeated several times in the course of the advertisement , and we are told that '' now for the first time is presented to the count - less admirers of
Stevenson	PERSON	the opportunity of pos - sessing his famous works in form worthy of the author 's genius . ''

		Comparison of the printed list of contents with the contents of the authorized copy - right edition of
Stevenson	PERSON	issued by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	shows that this '' complete edition '' contains in actuality something over half of
Stevenson	PERSON	's pub - lished writings .

		In its fraudulent claims this adver - tisement is hardly more than typical of the numerous announcements of '' editions de grande luxe , '' '' pub - lishers ' remainders , '' the '' exclusive sale '' of some time-honored plug of the book-jobber , '' world 's

		THE DIAL 287 greatest extracts , '' and other literary junk , which confront us shamelessly in many of our prominent magazines .

		It is not likely that bucket shops , medi - cal `` specialists , '' lotteries , astrologists , etc. , would be permitted by these magazines to prey upon their subscribers ; yet the hook swindler , no matter how barefaced his pretensions , seems never to be barred .

		Perhaps the most effective way of bringing about a reform would be for reputable book publishers to refuse to advertise in periodicals that lend their pages to the exploitation of '' fake '' book schemes .

		• • • A BAR TO ORIGIISrALITY IN AUTHORSHIP is the reading of current fiction .

		Distinction of style can - not thus be cultivated , nor will depth of thought be developed .

		Mr.
John Trevena	PERSON	, the Dartmoor novel - ist , whose stories are gaining an international repute , appears to lead a secluded life in his Dartmoor retreat , shunning not only his fellow-workers in lit - erature , but also their literary works .

		He can not see how it is possible for a writer to be original if he reads the books of the day .

		He is said to be a good classical scholar , and to have a good classical library -- which he reads .

		The newspapers he does not disdain , fop in them he thinks the life of a coun - try and real human nature are to be found .

		The village people about him , too , he studies with care , and no one has depicted the Dartmoor manners and customs and inhabitants so faithfully .

		From his publishers ' account of him it appears that `` when working he often retires to a lonely little cottage on the top of a hill with a fine view of the tors .

		There he lives absolutely alone with his dogs , doing his own cooking and housework for months together .

		Often he does not speak to anyone for over a week .

		He seems to be a source of some terror to the nearest village , as the people , who are still superstitious , regard him as a magician . ''

		Physical frailty as well as natural inclination seems to have imposed the simple life on Mr.
Trevena	PERSON	, who declares , char - acteristically : '' My aim above all is to preach not so much kindliness as ordinary justice towards animals ; and to remind men and women that they are animals too . ''

		, , , The multiplicity of '' book-fakes '' indicates the continuance of prosperity in those deleterious forms of commercial rather than literary activity .

		These schemes are of infinite variety as to form and method , but are animated by the same spirit -- the spirit of fake and humbug .

		Their dependence is largely upon their boldness .

		Their credulous victims , '' fed on boundless hopes '' of stupendous bargain - chances special to their case , pay enormous prices for cheap or worthless books , and '' spurn the simpler fare '' offered by the bookstores , where far better editions may be had at a fraction of the '' bargain '' prices .

		The notorious twenty thousand dollar swindle perpetrated last year near
Chicago	LOCATION	heads the list of these adventures ; but there are others hardly less barefaced .

		The latest that has come to our notice is one wherein '' a large building lot '' in '' the prettiest Summer resort in
Southern California	LOCATION	, just a short ride from
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, '' is offered free to subscribers to a work '' in thirty-one beautiful vol - umes '' in which has been gathered '' all that is worth preserving of the literature , the science and art of the world '' !

		A work so wonderful would be cheap at any price -- building lot or no building lot .

		• • • The wear and tear of public-library books almost passes belief .

		For example , the
Buffalo	LOCATION	lib - rary was obliged last year to withdraw -LRB- and , we infer , replace with new copies -RRB- 21,148 volumes , or nearly ten per cent of the total number of books in its possession .

		It must have been the case with many of these discarded books that , though too shabby for circulation or even for rebinding , they were still readable and in a condition to prove accept - able gifts to hospitals , asylums , mining camps , prisons , forest-dwellers , sailing-ship crews , night - watchmen , or other persons of enforced leisure and blessed with more appetite for reading than the wherewithal to satisfy it .

		The current report of the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	has a para - graph pertinent to this matter . ''

		Each year a num - ber of lumber camps throughout the state are given a supply of reading matter .

		Boxes are filled with books which have been withdrawn from the travel - ling libraries for various reasons , and which are in readable but short-lived condition , and with popular , illustrated magazines from the clearing house .

		Only books of live interest are sent , and these are varied to appeal to different tastes .

		In the
past two years 36	DATE	camps have been supplied , and in this way 478 books and
1159	DATE	magazines were distributed . ''

		There are doubtless many neglected opportunities for this sort of benefaction in both city and country .

		• • • Linear measurement applied to literature is something novel and a little amusing .

		Whether a certain distinguished man did or did not recently assert that a shelf five feet long would hold all the books needed to impart a liberal education , or whether , if he did say this , it was but in a semi - jocose mood , is not of supreme importance .

		That this casual seed of suggestion should have produced a crop of world 's - best-book-lists from numerous quarters is what might have been expected .

		The drawing-up of such a list , ruler in hand , is a rather fascinating exercise , and not the less so that prob - ably no two persons could be found to agree in their choice .

		Nevertheless the shelf might be filled in such wise as to leave no room for criticism .

		No one as yet has hit upon the idea , so here it is : Take a many-volumed edition of Shakespeare -- if one of the requisite proportions can not be found , let it be manufactured -- and fill therewith your five-foot shelf ; and if you have not then five feet of the world 's very best literature , what have you , one would like to know .

		And if its faithful perusal does not liberalize the mind , the reader must be regarded as an all but hopeless case .

		288 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, The final word in literaby journalism is , it seems , about to be uttered .

		A
Boston	LOCATION	publisher who -LRB- if we may believe his letter-head -RRB- is already engaged in issuing no less than six periodicals , de - voted to such seemingly various yet perhaps not wholly unrelated subjects as Inebriety , Bridge Whist , Occultism ,
Abnormal Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, and Skat , finds still some spare moments upon his hands , and these he intends to dedicate to a new '' bi-monthly magazine of Belles Lettres . '' ''

		For fifteen years , '' he tells us , `` I have watched American magazines -- particularly literary magazines , and I know what will interest and what will not . ''

		Happy mortal !

		An - other paragraph in his announcement outlines this gloomy picture of conditions just previous to what in after years will probably be termed the Taxidean ■ Americana period of literary journalism : '' There is no adequate literary review in the country . '

		The Dial ' is the nearest approach , and that is a list too ponderous .

		Years ago there was ' The Book Buyer ' which was excellent , but that was discontinued ; then there was ` The Critic ' and ` The Bookman , ' neither so interesting as ' The Book Buyer ' but still readable , now they are both general magazines . ''

		That '' list too ponderous '' is indeed a heavy indict - ment , -- though we confess to some haziness regard - ing its exact meaning .

		• • • Thrifty utilization of literary material is one of Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	's virtues , or vices , as a writer .

		When an American lady twitted him recently on his tendency to repeat himself in the matter of jokes , the novelist-playwright laughed and said his nationality was to blame . ''

		I am a Scot , '' he explained , '' and we Scots abhor waste . ''

		He then asked his interlocutor if she had ever heard of old
Saunders Carlyle	PERSON	, who always drank off his whiskey to the last drop the very instant it was poured out for him .

		When asked why he gulped it down so greedily , the old man replied that he had once had his glass knocked over between the filling and the drinking .

		An even better illustration of thriftiness than Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's could be adduced in the economical but not exactly close-fisted Yankee who always took his seat in church near the door , where the contribution box in its rounds would reach him last , his motive being to lose as little in - terest as possible on his donation .

		Buffalo 's book-readers appear to appreciate their public library , which even the casual visitor will remember as one of the best-equipped and most active in the country .

		Its energetic work among young readers , in the children 's department and in the schools , is worthy of notice .

		The current annual report has three full-page illustrations of some of our potentially great men and women -LRB- scholars , writers , scientists , publicists -RRB- of the future engrossed in the absorbing occupation of choosing a book , or clustering in an eager group over the open pages of a favorite volume .

		The
Saturday	DATE
morning	TIME	story hour is reported to be so popular that the entertain - ment often has to be repeated for the benefit of the overflow .

		But we are assured that `` it is far more than a pastime for the hour , and is legitimate library work , which should be greatly extended . ''

		The crowded condition of the children 's room suggests the providing of an '' intermediate department '' for a somewhat older class of readers , and it is hoped that the experiment may be tried this year .

		Note - worthy and praiseworthy is the
Buffalo	LOCATION	children 's appetite for non-fiction , which embraces forty-five per cent of their total book-drawings .

		This record puts to shame the average book-reading adult .

		• • • A LITTLE CONFUSION OF NAMES , which annually recurs at about this season , brings forth with like reg - ularity the explanation that the IngersoU lectureship at Harvard on '' The Immortality of Man '' is not in memory of the late Colonel
Robert G. IngersoU	PERSON	, but was founded by Miss
Caroline IngersoU	PERSON	in
1893	DATE	in obedience to the instructions and in the name of her deceased father ,
George G. IngersoU	PERSON	, a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate .

		The choice of lecturer , not limited to any one denomination or profession , has already fallen on men distinguished in various walks of science and literature .

		This year it was the good fortune of those in attendance to hear Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	present his views on the general theme -- the exact title of his discourse being , '' Is Immortality Desirable ? ''

		The
May	DATE	number of the '' Atlantic '' publishes this welcome contribution of a scholarly and original thinker on a subject of almost universal interest .

		• • • An UP-TO-THE-MINUTE NEWS SERVICE is enjoyed by the people of that semi-oriental , one is tempted to say semi-somnolent , historic old city on the
Danube	LOCATION	,
Budapest	LOCATION	.

		The telephone , not the printing-press , is made the medium of an almost hourly transmis - sion of news items , -- stock-quotations , weather - forecast , parliamentary doings , closing prices on the exchange , extraordinary events , and so on ; while toward evening there follows a music programme from caf6 or beer-garden , and later the subscriber can enjoy an opera from the
Royal Opera House	ORGANIZATION	or listen to the dialogue of a play that is being pre - sented at one of the theatres .

		PENNSYLVANIA HISTORY IN POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Mr.
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	, in a letter printed in The Dial of
April 1	DATE	, says that he knows of no poetry in - spired by the civilization of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	suitable for his recently-published anthology entitled `` Poems of American History . ''

		Years ago I made a collection of historical poems from which , from time to time , either by request or other -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 wise , I have sent selections to compilers of various anthol - ogies .

		It would have given me pleasure to forward to Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, along with other poems relating to the history of
New Jersey	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and several ref - erences to certain private and printed collections , which I sent him , a clue to a number of poems by poets of wide fame called forth by the civilization of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Whether these poems would have proved suitable for his collection would depend I think upon the compiler 's willingness to throw open that closed shutter of the mind which should have looked out upon the broad field of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	history .

		It would be strange indeed if the colony and commonwealth which led the way in the great changes of the criminal law , in religious tolera - tion , in the founding of charities and the human uplift in so many directions , which early became the American centre of literature , law , medicine , and science , and within whose borders are the birthplace of the
Declara	LOCATION	- tion of Independence and the Constitution ,
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	and the battlefields of
Brandywine	ORGANIZATION	,
Germantown	LOCATION	, and
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, had called forth no poetry suitable for an anthology of historical poems .

		The internal evidence supplied by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's compilation itself raises a doubt as to whether his plea of unfamiliarity with the poetry relating to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is entirely frank .

		Can it be possible , for instance , that he did not know of
Wordworth	LOCATION	's sonnets upon the founding of the Episcopacy in the American branch of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	and their tribute to Bishop White of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, -- `` the Saintly White , ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	calls him ?

		The figure of
Bishop White	ORGANIZATION	is a large one in the religious history of
America	LOCATION	.

		The founding of the Episcopacy was an important historical event , and as a poet
Wordsworth	PERSON	seems to meet with Mr.
Steven	PERSON	- son 's partial approval .

		For , though these interesting sonnets are missing from his book , the accompanying sonnets by the same poet , printed side by side with them in the poet 's works , but relating to the
New England	LOCATION	section of the country , of which the compiler is a native , are present .

		It is difficult to reach any other conclusion than that Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	chose the one set of Words - worth 's sonnets and rejected the other set , and his plea of unfamiliarity , therefore , would seem to fall to the ground .

		There is another sonnet by
Wordsworth	PERSON	addressed '' To the Pennsylvanias . ''

		It mingles praise of Pemi and the early times with censure of the financial straits in which
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	found herself for a period in
the first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	because of her en - thusiasm in making canals and other internal improve - ments .

		The historical significance of the sonnet is too important to be ignored .

		Although Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	dis - claims familiarity with it , I think he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt .

		When
Joseph Priestly	PERSON	, the discoverer of oxygen , in the year
1794	DATE	sought refuge in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	from the violence of an intolerant English mob , which had pil - laged his house and scattered his scientific apparatus , another famous English poet ,
Coleridge	PERSON	, addressed him a sonnet inspired by Priestly 's expatriation .

		It might be thought that this sonnet would have interested a native of
New England	LOCATION	because of Dr. Priestly 's promi - nence as a Unitarian , if for no other reason .

		The
Wyoming Massacre	ORGANIZATION	inspired still another English poet ,
Thomas Campbell	PERSON	, to write ''
Gertrude	PERSON	of
Wyo	LOCATION	- ming , '' inaccurate as to its ornithology and in some other respects , but sufficiently accurate in the spirit of its description of the actual massacre .

		The American poet
Fitz Greene Halleck	PERSON	also wrote a poem on
Wyoming	LOCATION	, several of his lines showing that there was a greater familiarity with
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's poem in
New York	LOCATION	in the nineteenth century than there would appear to be in
Ohio	LOCATION	in the twentieth , for
Halleck	PERSON	says : `` Nature hath made thee lovelier than the power Even of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's pen hath pictured . ''

		Byron in '' Don Juan '' gives two stanzas to the
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania poem , but there is no extract from either the English poem or the American poem in '' Poems of American History . ''

		Thomas
Moore	PERSON	left as a record of his life in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , where tradition says he occupied a cottage ou the banks of the
Schuylkill	LOCATION	, a poem which for its bear - ing upon social and literary history was as much entitled to a place in Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's book as was
Halleck	PERSON	's tribute to
Drake	PERSON	or many another included in the an - thology .

		Of the many historical poems relating to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	only a very few , and most of these of minor historical significance , are to be found in '' Poems of American History . ''

		Buchanan Read 's '' The Treaty Elm , '' cele - brating
Penn	LOCATION	's famous treaty with the Indians , `` the treaty never sworn to and never broken , '' is missing .

		So is the same author 's spirited description of the cele - brated '' Meschianza , '' the entertainment given in
Phil	LOCATION	- adelphia during the British occupation , for which Major Andre acted as a designer .

		Absent , too , is any extract from
George H. Boker	PERSON	's patriotic poem delivered before the
Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1865	DATE	.


Bayard Taylor	PERSON	's poem on the battle of
Brandywine	ORGANIZATION	is missing .

		A half dozen poems on
Bennington	LOCATION	are given , but there is room for only one relating to that spot of holy ground of which the orator said '' Lips in every language have lisped the name of Valley Forge . ''

		From the fields of his local preference Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	has garnered with care and enthusiasm .

		He appears to have rushed through
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	history in an auto - mobile driven beyond the speed limit , seeing little beyond '' his own roadway .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's suggestion that
Whittier	LOCATION	's poem '' The
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Pilgrim '' was too long for his pur - pose is not warranted by the brevity of the lofty address to posterity by
Francis Daniel Pastorius	PERSON	written in
1688	DATE	, which consists of twenty-three lines .

		Whittier 's poem readily lends itself to the making of such extracts as the compiler took from long
New England	LOCATION	poems .

		More - over ,
Whittier	LOCATION	wrote many short poems inspired by
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	civilization .

		One of the best of them , one of the best short poems the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet ever wrote , is his '' Hymn of the Dunkers , '' in which , while historical fact is reflected in verse with unusual art , the poet made unwitting return for the service rendered by one of the Brethren to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	in translating at their request the Declaration of Independence into most of the languages of
Europe	LOCATION	.


Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	says that his inimitable creation , ''
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	, '' was suggested by a trooper of a
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	cavalry regiment .

		In the Breitmann ballads
Leland	PERSON	preserved with humor , phil - osophy , learning , and spirit an interesting phase of civil war life .

		The reader not unnaturally asks , why is then given the ballad about
Dawes	PERSON	and nothing from
Breit	PERSON	- mann ?

		If we assume that Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's book has some other purpose than that implied by the title , even if his compilation were primarily intended for use in schools such purpose makes even more noticeable the omission of
Leland	LOCATION	's poem beginning : 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, '' One day when I was on the march In eighteen hundred and sixty-three , The very day when General
Meade	PERSON	Was driving
General Lee Before	ORGANIZATION	him out of
Maryland	LOCATION	. ''

		The poem describes
Leland	PERSON	's visit , while on the inarch from
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, to an empty schoolhouse , where a Con - federate on the advance into
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, had written a boasting sentence upon the blackboard .

		Under it Leland inscribed a witty Latin phrase , and '' No doubt it pleased the schoolmaster When he returned again . ''

		This poem would seem to be one of special interest to young people still engaged in school work .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's explanation of certain irregularities in his book does not call for extended comment .

		The term '' Federals '' was applied to the Northern troops by the Southern people and their European friends .

		The Northern soldiers were fighting for the preservation of the union ; they called themselves Union soldiers , and they have not since ceased to prefer the term chosen by themselves to the one conferred upon them by their opponents .

		The citation of authority for the errors of the note upon the ballad , ''
Keenan	PERSON	's Charge , '' will not greatly impress anyone familiar with Civil War history .

		As has been indicated , an anthology of bulk and poetic excellence could readily be compiled from the historical poems inspired by
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	civilization said by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	to be unknown to him .

		EDUCATION AND THE STATE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Your discussion of '' Home Rule and Public Educa - tion , '' in The Dial of
April 16	DATE	, is an interesting and hopeful sign of these entirely too material times .

		When you say that '' it has been the recognized duty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to see that the means of education are provided for its youthful citizens , '' you state what can not be suc - cessfully controverted .

		But if you were to add that this '' recognized duty '' has always been religiously dis - charged , you would find a large army of dissenters .

		The truth of the matter is that the '' duty '' has been too often transferred to '' the local community , '' and this , in turn , refuses '' the needed financial support . ''

		While the principle is well fixed in our American institutions , its practical workings have not met the expectations of those who firmly adhere to the belief that , in a repre - sentative government , the only true education is that which is furnished by the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		All others are par - tial , one-sided , and incomplete .

		So , when you assert that '' education is the function of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, not of the coimty , or town , because it is a matter too essential to the common welfare to be left to the caprice of the locality , '' I feel like exclaiming : Amen and Amen !

		For in that you have stated what ought to be conceded uni - versally , but which many well-meaning citizens have yet to appreciate .

		Nevertheless , the emphasis which you give to public education as a State function is well put and is greatly needed in this country at this very moment .

		As a school officer , I have seen the need of constant repetition of this important and valuable truth .

		Indeed , it can not be brought home to the individual and the community too often .

		The CARLYLE-WELiSH liOVE-IjETTERS .

		* In view of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's vehemently expressed desire that the sanctities of his domestic life should never be profaned by biographer 's pen , it is a curious freak of destiny that has caused his marital relations and all his home privacies to be more minutely and relentlessly pried into and laid open and publicly discussed than those of almost any other famous personage in the world 's history .

		And in all this peeking and prying and gossiping there has necessarily been more tlian a little of misrepresentation , of innu - endo , and even of scandal , until by this time the public ought to be in that reactionary mood which will make acceptable and easily credible a saner , soberer , less sensationally dramatic presentment of the gifted dyspeptic and his talented wife in their mutual relations and their daily life .

		It is largely in the hope of righting past wrongs -- wrongs that he lays primarily at the door of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's biographer -- that Mr.
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Carlyle	PERSON	now publishes , in approximate completeness , '' The Love Letters of
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	and
Jane Welsh	PERSON	, '' in two volumes uni - form with the '' New Letters , '' which he has already edited from the pens of both .

		Of this pre-matrimonial correspondence , which
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	expressly wished to remain unpublished , the editor writes in his preface : '' The holy of holies having been sacrilegiously forced , dese - crated , and polluted , and its sacred relics de - faced , besmirched , and held up to ridicule , any further intrusion therein -- for the purpose of cleansing and admitting the purifying air and light of heaven -- can now be attended , in the long rim , by nothing but good results . ''

		His present task , therefore , is but a continuation and , one may hope , a completion of what was begun in the earlier publication of the carefully annotated '' New Letters , '' -- the correcting , namely , of false reports , and the silencing of mischievous gossip .

		In characteristic style he vents a little of his bottled-up wrath upon poor
Froude	PERSON	and his unspeakable Froudacities .

		To some of us in whose veins there runs no drop of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	blood it almost seems as if that strangely irresponsible but highly entertaining , even inspiring , writer of biography and history had already been sufficiently castigated for his * The Love-Letters of

		THE DIAL 291 sins and might by this time be suffered to rest in peace as the helpless victim of unaccountable prepossessions and fixed ideas .

		Let us now dip into the letters themselves and allow them to tell their own story .

		Only four days after his first call , under Irving 's escort , on Mrs.
Welsh	PERSON	and her daughter at
Haddington	LOCATION	, young
Carlyle	PERSON	wrote his opening letter , in semi-sentimental vein , to the owner of the bright eyes that seem to have pierced his armor at the very first glance .

		Amorous impet - uosity on his part , and maidenly reserve amount - ing even to coldness and severity on hers , are , naturally enough , plainly in evidence in the first few letters .

		But the suitor was not so blinded by his passion as to fail to perceive that a woman 's No is not always to be literally inter - preted .

		Chilly silence and harsh rebuffs did not discourage him ; and before
the first eighteen months of the five years	DATE	' wooing were over , the two had arrived at a more than friendly footing , and thenceforward there was little but smooth - ness to the course of their true love .

		A few sentences from
Miss Welsh	LOCATION	's third letter must here be quoted .

		After thanking her corre - spondent for a book he had sent her , the writer proceeds : '' I have moreover read your Letter .

		For it I do not thank you .

		It afforded me neither pleasure nor amuse - ment .

		Indeed , my Friend , this Letter of yours has , to my mind , more than one fault .

		I do not allude to its being egotistical .

		To speak of oneself is , they say , a privilege of Friendship ... But there is about it an air of levity which I dislike ; which seems to me to form an unnatural union with the other qualities of your head and heart , and to be ill-timed in treating of a subject to you the most important of all subjects -- your own Destiny ... Besides this there is about your Letter a mystery which I detest .

		It is so full of meaning words miderlined ; meaning sentences half-finished ; meaning blanks with notes of admiration ; and meaning quotations from foreign languages , that really in this abundance of meaning it seems to indicate , I am somewhat at a loss to discover what you would be at .

		I know how you will excuse yourself on this score : You will say that you knew my Mother would see your Letter ; and that , of course , you cared not to what difficulties I as Interpreter might be subjected , so that you got your feelings toward me expressed .

		Now Sir , once for all , I beg you to understand that I dislike as much as my Mother dis - approves your somewhat too ardent expressions of Friendship towards me ; and that if you can not write to me as to a man who feels a deep interest in your welfare , who admires your talents , respects your virtues , and for the sake of these has often , -- perhaps too often , overlooked your faults ; -- if you can not write to me as if -- as if you were married , you need never waste ink or paper on me more . ''

		Let us now see in what temper the rebuked lover replies to this .

		He shows himself pos - sessed of a certain self-respecting good-nature that is not easily ruffled .

		His letter begins as follows : '' I have read your Letter over and over ; and ad - mired the talent displayed in it not a little .

		I have a small , exceedingly small vein of satire myself : but there is no need to conjecture whether it would serve to de - fend me in the present instance : you know well enough I dare not try .

		It was once reckoned generous , I be - lieve , to ' crush the haughty , but spare those who can not resist ' ; -- however I do not complain .

		This conflict of sarcasms can hardly gratify or punLsh any very noble feeling in either you or me ; and I am content to have my vanity humbled since you wish it so . ''

		Pass on now to a date
less than two years later	DATE	, and mark the tone in which the once haughtily reserved damsel meets her wooer 's advances .

		The letter is dated '' Hell -LSB- meaning
Templand	PERSON	, the home of the writer 's maternal grandfather -RSB- ,
19th August	DATE	-LSB- 1823 -RSB- , '' and begins in this delightfully cordial fashion : '' Your last Letter was especially welcome : it came in a lucky moment .

		I had just been -LRB- or fancied I had been -RRB- most barbarously dealt with , and was ready to hang or drown myself in good earnest ; but the sight of your handwriting can cheat me out of ill-humour at any time ; it always presents so many delightful images , and excites so many delightful expectations !

		Oh , you have no notion how great a blessing our correspondence is to me !

		When I am vexed , I write my grievances to you ; and the assurance 1 have that your next Letter will bring me consolation , already consoles me .

		And then , when your Letter comes -- when it repeats to me that One in the world loves me -- will love me ever , ever , -- and tells me more boldly than Hope , that my future may yet be glorious and happy , there is no obstacle I do not feel prepared to meet and conquer .

		I owe you much !

		feel - ings and sentiments that ennoble my character , that give dignity , interest and enjoyment to my life .

		In return , I can only love you , and that I do , from the bottom of my heart . ''

		To balance this extract a paragraph must be quoted from
Carlyle	LOCATION	's last letter to Miss Welsh The first sentence , as a footnote explains , has a double allusion , -- first , to Swift 's article en - titled '' The last Speech and dying Words of
Ebenezer Elliston	LOCATION	, '' and , secondly , to the old ballad called '' The Unfortunate Miss
Bailey	PERSON	. ''

		This , then , is the self-congratulatory tone in which the soon-to-be-married man begins : '' ' The Last Speech and marrying words of that un - fortunate young woman
Jane Baillie Welsh	PERSON	, ' I received on
Friday	DATE
morning	TIME	; and truly a most delightful and swan-like melody was in them ; a tenderness and warm devoted trust , worthy of such a maiden bidding farewell to the -LRB- unmarried -RRB-
Earth	LOCATION	, of which she was the fairest ornament .

		Dear little Child !

		How is it that I have deserved thee ; deserved a purer and nobler heart than falls to the lot of millions ?

		I swear I will love thee with my whole heart , and think my life well spent if it can make thme happy . ''

		Where , all this time , some may ask , has
Edward Irving	PERSON	been keeping himself , and what 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, are his feelings for Miss Welsh and hers for him throughout this courtship ?

		It will surprise most readers to be assured by the editor that , as to any alleged attachment between the young lady and her former teacher , there is , in collo - quial phrase , '' nothing in it . ''

		And in Appendix B , Note Three , twenty-five pages of fine print are devoted to demolishing the
Irving	LOCATION	-
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	love legend .

		A pre-Carlylean love affair there does appear to have been ; but the object of
Jane	PERSON	's girlish affection was not Irving , but one
George Rennie	PERSON	, who , manifestly unworthy of , and perhaps unconscious of , the young maiden 's favor , took himself unceremoniously off the scene and became lost to fame .

		Irving seems to have cherished an elder-brotherly regard for his former pupil , and to have been interested , as a minister of religion , in her soul 's welfare ; but the evidence adduced by the editor certainly undermines the romantic fable of the insuper - able obstacle -LRB- in the shape of the woman Irving eventually did marry -RRB- to the union of two break - ing hearts .

		Proof is offered , from Mrs.
Oli	PERSON	- phant 's pen , of the entire harmony and happiness prevailing in Mr. and Mrs.
Irving	PERSON	's relations to each other .

		But who can read a woman 's heart ?

		Whether
Jane Welsh	PERSON	ever felt senti - mentally inclined toward her talented and attrac - tive teacher -- and such a feeling would have been no more than natural , perhaps almost inevitable at her age and in her seclusion from much other society -- or , indeed , whether Irving ever conceived a tender affection for his pupil , who at their first meeting was little more than half his age , no one can now pronounce with certainty ; nor does it much matter how the case stood .

		There is at most but very slight foun - dation for the elaborate superstructure that has been built up concerning these two and their alleged desperate fondness for each other .

		To an impartial reader these love letters must strengthen the impression already pro- duced by the post-nuptial correspondence of their writers , -- an impression of a deep and last - ing attachment between two somewhat similarly gifted , and perhaps for that reason somewhat mutually incompatible , natures .

		A more pla - cidly humdrum domestic existence would un - doubtedly have been theirs if each had chosen a mate constitutionally adapted to undergo , with - out irritant friction , daily contact with his or her angularities and asperities .

		But in a world of only approximately perfect adjustments theirs is to be regarded as a far from unhappy union , and one whose history mankind will long take pleasure in reading .

		The two volumes contain one hundred and seventy-six letters and ninety pages of appended matter , including seventeen poems , chiefly by `` T. C. '' and `` J. W. '' Especially interesting is it to note the early appearance and the increas - ing prominence of those distinctive features that place the letters of both
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife among the very best that literature contains .

		No uncertain or tedious scrawl ever comes from their pens ; but from the first they write with a mastery of their medium , a command of vigor - ous and vivid English , that is a source of unfail - ing delight .

		The many illustrations and the abundant footnotes and full index are all that one could desire for so important a work .

		If the last word has not now been said on the relations of Mr. and Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	to each other , the fault is not Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	's .

		Psychology and Psychotherapy .

		* How shall a knowledge of our mental nature contribute to the efficiency and worth of the life of high purpose which our ideals commend ?

		That is the dominant , though not the exclusive , problem of applied psychology .

		The parallelism of the two streams of human interest thus sug - gested is historically and actually more conspic - uous than their bond of connection ; and the manner of portraying this underlying affiliation commits the psychologist to a fundamental aspect of his profession .

		The issue appears in every field of human endeavor in which the commendable is to be separated from the unde - sirable , the socially fit from the socially unfit .

		Morality , education , hygiene , art , literature , and religion , the industrial pursuits and the political welfare , are affected by the trend and temper of the attitude that is reached and made effective .

		The result becomes the contribution of psy - chology to the philosophy of life .

		No more concrete and valuable application of the larger problem appears on the vista of our present interests than that which affects the atti - tude toward the maintenance of human health , which means sanity ; and Professor
Miinster	PERSON	- berg 's book entitled `` Psychotherapy '' finds its significance as a worthy and wholesome influ - ence to this end .

		The term `` psychothera - peutics '' has found popular currency , but the meaning that we attach to it makes of it either dross or gold .

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 circulate with almost equal acceptance ; and it is the business of those professing some expert - ness in this complex field to furnish the ready means for their intelligent discrimination .

		It is far more important that this shall be done , than that we shall at once reach a consensus in regard to how it shall be done , or whose busi - ness primarily it is to do it .

		Professor
Miin	PERSON	- sterberg 's contribution consists of three logically arranged steps : the first setting forth the man - ner of connection between the doctrines and findings of psychology and the utilization of the mental influences in the relief of disabilities and impediments ; the second furnishing some living pictures of these influences in action ; the third presenting the manner in which principle and procedure affect the interests of the physi - cian , the minister , the psychologist , and the public .

		It may be questioned whether the layman -LRB- to whom the volume is addressed -RRB- will derive any very direct benefit from the reading of the in - troductory presentation ; and he has the author 's frank permission to skip it .

		Yet even if he reads casually , he is likely to gather that the determination of the relations of body and mind is a very intricate and evasive task , -- an impres - sion that may render him less susceptible if not wholly immune to the assertive and aggressive advances of the impatient practitioner of what - ever '' ism '' or '' pathy . ''

		The central theme that the causal point of view -- which is psy - chology 's along with her sister sciences -- must be held apart from the purposive , which is the attitude of ethics , religion , and the ideals of life , commands consent but not conviction .

		And as the reader becomes interested in the account of cases cured , the manner of their treatment , and in the practical bearings of this therapy in the actual situations of life , he can not see that these appear more comprehensive to his understanding from any belief or scepticism of the aforesaid principles .

		Indeed , the whole may be read as in apologia for the author 's former disavowal that psychology has much of a message for edu - cation or the practical arts of life .

		To achieve a rational attitude toward the psychic ministrations of a mind diseased seems no easy matter , so entangled is the subject with prejudices , dubious practices , and theories which are not dubious but conspicuously perverted .

		This is the field in which materialism -LRB- a term by which to condemn -RRB- and idealism -LRB- an epithet of disparagement -RRB- seem determined to quarrel at every encounter , when indeed they can be persuaded to enter a common arena .

		The one irritably asks why the body should be com - plicated by a mind , and the other 's disdain can not understand why the mind should be handicapped with a body .

		The modern varieties of the latter type of ignoring the obvious has certainly led to the most elaborate nonsense to which practically-minded individuals ever sacri - ficed time or dollars .

		The former is a much more modest prejudice , an uneasiness in the presence of mental symptoms and mental methods of treatment , as of things irregular , untrustworthy , and obscure .

		To the one , mind can move mountains ; and the other tries this motive power only with hesitation and reserva - tion on mole hills .

		The rational use of mental influences on the ills that flesh -- or is is mind ?

		-- is heir to is neither a miracle nor a revelation .

		It is a legitimate outcome of legitimate study ; and it is high time that in the judgment of fair-minded men , the bar sinister of its ancient pedigree -LRB- and may one add , of its bastard descendants ? -RRB-

		should be ignored .

		The grudg - ing scepticism of the physician is as misplaced , though very differently motived , as the uncrit - ical propagandism of the drugless , matterless , body less healers .

		It is not necessary for those who endorse Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's intermediary point of view , to endorse even this in its details , or to have an opinion favorable or otherwise upon his own treatment of his own cases .

		If sympa - thetically inclined , they will recognize that as a professor of psychology , who is also by training a doctor of medicine but not a practitioner , he has been willing to bend his interests and his expertness to the relief of some selected cases .

		There is no obligation or intent to convert the psychological laboratory into a clinic ; and the recorded opinion of the volume is against such procedure .

		The position consistently adhered to is that the field of practice belongs by war - rant of training and profession to the medical man ; and that the psychologist , like the minis - ter , is a coadjutor , -- though summoned for very different reasons and occasions .

		The evidence that psychic measures are effective in the treat - ment of disease is extensive and convincing .

		That it is particularly effective in that inesti - mably vast and important mass of disabilities , inefficiencies , and impediments of mental origin , that wreck as many lives and cause as much havoc and agony as the minor ravages of microbes or the obvious crippling of detectable injury , is equally clearly spread upon the min - utes of every observing physician 's case-book .

		Accepting its utility and wise applicability , we 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, are prepared to find a modus vivendi for its step-by-step introduction into the practical con - cerns of modern life .

		On the medical side the moral is obvious .

		The psychologist , if his interests do not happen to turn him that way , need not be a practitioner ; but the practitioner should be something of a psychologist .

		And , moreover , he should be just that kind of psychologist who has an insight into the minor psychic failings of a complex but very prevalent humanity .

		He may , if he is crowded in his preparation , know only enough of insanity and the larger abnormalities to recognize them , and turn them over to a proper specialist ; but the lesser disabilities , like the poor , he will always have with him .

		If he wishes to serve his patients with the full equipment of modern resources , his quiver should be as well provided with psychic shafts as with the keen-cutting or drugged points of his ominous black bag .

		For the parties of the other part argument will avail little .

		Psychology is as hopeless to provide an antidote for quacks as for their dupes ; and few of either kidney present themselves without a letter of recommendation , which they have some - how extracted -LRB- or forged -RRB- from that abused and complacent scion of learning .

		But a word must be said in regard to an alliance of most worthy intent , now incorporated in what is known as the ''
Emmanuel	PERSON	movement . ''

		At best this is but a passing phase of a larger interest .

		Other and better modes of providing for this service are certain to be developed .

		Professor
Miin	PERSON	- sterberg takes the commendable position that the minister 's mode of appeal should be utilized with discretion when it is needed as a therapeu - tic aid ; but that the latter 's usurpation of the medical man 's function is unwise , is dangerous , and can not be supported by the arguments that enforce the psychologist 's cooperation and guidance .

		But physician , minister , and psychologist alike , directly or indirectly , have an obligation to serve the sanity of the community ; and a right and rational understanding of what psy - chology means , and what the psychologist 's pur - poses are , is as essential to these professions as it is to the integrity of just those phases of the public sanity that are to-day most affected by pseudo-scientific f olderol about the subconscious mind , and psychic waves , and new thought , and other disguise of old superstition .

		It is , in brief , because psychology desires to minister to prac - tical needs , and is in a position to perform a modest service ; and because , whether willing or unwilling , psychology is certain to have her name taken in vain in support of measures which she knows not of ; and because the practical desire to shake off this mortal coil of pain and disa - bility is amongst the most urgent of all motives for the study of mind and the things of earth and heaven , that the right understanding of the rela - tions of psychology and healing becomes a matter of public concern .

		The dominant temper and central bearing of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's work is a contribution to that desirable end .


Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	.

		liOREXZO THE MAGNIPICENT , AND His Time .

		*
Lorenzo de Medici	ORGANIZATION	has been so favorite a topic with writers of both history and literature , that a new work on the subject must lay claim to some special merit to justify its appearance .

		Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	fully meets this condition ; his life of Lorenzo the Magnificent occupies a very imique position , and deserves a hearty welcome not only from the general student of the Italian Renaissance but from the specialist in
Floren	LOCATION	- tine history as well .

		Of the previous literature on the subject , only three works can lay claim to adequate treatment --
Roscoe	PERSON	's life .

		Von
Reumont	ORGANIZATION	's elaborate work , and
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	's monograph .

		Roscoe 's book , written nearly a century ago , is obviously not abreast of modem scholarship ;
Von Reumont	ORGANIZATION	's work , though based on diligent study and careful research , is de - signed rather for reference than for general reading , while the English version is written in such a style as to make consecutive reading im - possible ;
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	's scholarly work is ideal as far as it goes , but it makes no attempt to portray all the phases of
Lorenzo	LOCATION	's many-sided activities .

		Even the briefest perusal of Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	's work , discloses a ripe scholarship combined with a high degree of appreciation of the requirements of his task .

		Within the compass of five hun - dred pages he has given us a complete portrai - ture of his hero from every point of view , and has also sketched a vivid picture of Florentine history during the fifteenth century .

		Lorenzo as statesman , diplomatist , patron of art and letters , humanist , author , -- every side of this marvel - lous man receives adequate and in some cases original treatment .

		Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	is frankly an admirer of
Lorenzo	LOCATION	, and is anxious to present his hero in * Lorenzo the Magnificent , and
Florence	LOCATION	in her Golden Age .

		By
E. L. S. Horsburgh	PERSON	,
B. A. New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		295 the best possible light ; in fact , one might almost consider his work an apology for the whole Medician regime .

		This attitude , a result of sympathetic appreciation , rather than strict his - torical criticism , appears most prominently in the chapters on
Lorenzo	LOCATION	's methods of govern - ment .

		The author rejects absolutely the view that
Lorenzo	PERSON	was a cold and calculating tyrant who had deliberately set himself to destroy the liberties of a free republic .

		Lorenzo , he declares , was invested with his power by the voluntary act of the ruling class of Florentine citizens ; he slipped naturally into the place prepared for him by his grandfather ,
Cosimo	PERSON	.

		Moreover , no other course was left open to him ; such was his wealth , his influence , and his repu - tation , that if he was to be a public man he must be first or nowhere : the Medici once removed , the rule of the Albizzi or
Pazzi	ORGANIZATION	would inevitably follow .

		The Florentines , thinks Mr.
Hors	PERSON	- burgh , had not only lost their capacity of self - government , but a thorough-going republican regime would have been a fatal anachronism .

		Florence was surrounded by a cordon of unscru - pulous and grasping neighbors , and an abso - lutism in some form must stand between her and destruction .

		Hence in the establishment of his personal government
Lorenzo	PERSON	has ample justification on the grounds both of practical necessity and patriotic duty .

		While advancing the fortunes of his own house , he was performing an inestimable service to the
State	ORGANIZATION	as well .

		Assuming , then , that the government of the Medici was a logical necessity , the author goes on to show how well Lorenzo acquitted himself of his task .

		And in truth the problems to be faced were no easy ones .

		The Florentines must be accustomed to a veiled despotism while their vanity was to be flattered by all the exter - nal trappings of republicanism .

		Florence must wax powerful and prosperous by the mainten - nance of a nicely adjusted balance of power within
Italy	LOCATION	, and above all no pretext must be given for foreign interventions from beyond the Alps .

		These were but a few of the many diffi - culties which Lorenzo met and overcame .

		It is entirely beside the mark to upbraid Lorenzo with sordid manipulation of political machinery or unblushing bestowal of state offices , of finesse and corruption .

		Such things were the inevitable result of
Lorenzo	LOCATION	's anom - alous position , of trjdng to maintain the delusion of freedom while exercising the powers of an autocrat .

		With the aid of these considerations , the author boldly grapples with the various charges that have been made against
Lorenzo	PERSON	's system of government .

		The most damaging of these accusations is the alleged appropriation of public funds for private uses .

		Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	rightly considers this the crux of the whole question ; if he can explain away this charge , the rehabilitation of Lorenzo will be complete .

		After emphasizing again the desire of the Florentines to enjoy aU the luxury and advan - tage of a monarchy without paying for it , and without providing the machinery for its main - tenance , he adds : '' In modern monarchies , a Civil List , amply sufficient for the dignity and needs of the monarch , is provided at the expense of the public revenue .

		In
Florence	LOCATION	,
Lorenzo	PERSON	's anomalous position as a private citizen , some - how invested with the dignity of Head of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, produced a corresponding financial anomaly .

		In all
State	ORGANIZATION	ceremonial he was required to take the lead .

		He was expected , as a matter of course , to entertain splen - didly royal or distinguished visitors who came to Flor - ence for their pleasure or diplomatic business .

		No allowances from the public funds were made to him for these purposes .

		It was at his own expense that he was required to perform absolutely necessary public services .

		Wheij , therefore , he struck a balance between what the
State	ORGANIZATION	owed to him , and what he owed to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, it was not unnatural that he should conclude that the debt was not all on one side ; that if there was little discrim - ination on the one part there need not be very much discrimination on the other .

		The fact is that
Lorenzo	PERSON	is so modern , he is so nearly in touch with the thought and standards of to-day that we almost instinctively judge him from the point of view of to-day .

		We apply to him an ideal of conduct which we should never dream of applying to Tudors , or even to Bourbons ... Critics of Lorenzo are constantly forgetful of the con - ditions of government and life which existed in his day .

		It is the highest testimony to the real greatness of Lorenzo that he should be so judged -- that we are not content to palliate in him faults which in other rulers of the time we readily condone .

		Lorenzo is one of the few men in history for whom the world has never been ready to admit the extenuating plea of circumstances and environment .

		It is instinctively felt that he had the higher light , and that where he sinned , he sinned against that light . ''

		It would be an injustice to Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	to limit this brief review to those portions of his work dealing with
Lorenzo	PERSON	s government .

		Other chapters , though less original in treatment , are extremely interesting .

		The section devoted to the
Pazzi	LOCATION	conspiracy -- that all but successful attempt of the disgruntled
Pazzi	PERSON	nobles , abetted by Pope
Sixtus IV.	PERSON	, to assassinate
Lorenzo	PERSON	and his brother in the Duomo of
Florence	LOCATION	-- reads more like a romance than sober history .

		The chapter describing
Lorenzo	PERSON	's last days also has .

		a distinct historical value .

		Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	rightly rejects the traditional accoimt found in most of the biographies of
Savonarola	LOCATION	, that
Lorenzo	PERSON	died unshriven owing to the impossible conditions imposed by the uncompromising 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Dominican monk .

		The last hours of the great Medici were spent with his friends
Poliziano	PERSON	and
Pico della Mirandola	LOCATION	, and he passed away in the bosom of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	's work is a distinct contribu - tion to Italian literature and humanism , as well as to Florentine history .

		After briefly but clearly indicating
Lorenzo	PERSON	's relation to the Renaissance , the author devotes some sixty pages to
Lorenzo	LOCATION	as poet and writer .

		At first sight it would seem as if Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	could glean but little after so full a harvest had been reaped by such specialists as
Symonds	PERSON	and Gaspary ; but here again a well-worn subject is enlivened by distinct originality of treatment .

		The sonnets , lyrics , miracle plays , dance songs , the
Canti Carnascialeschi	PERSON	, are all passed in review .

		And in his analysis and appreciation of
Lorenzo	LOCATION	's prose commentary to his sonnets , and the satirical poem of
Nencia da Barberino	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	has rendered the student of Italian literature a genuine service ; as far as I am aware , the Commentario has never before received treatment commensurate with its importance .

		One lays down the work of Mr.
Horsburgh	PERSON	with a feeling that one has read a book distinctly worth while .

		Had the author made his work a little less popular in tone , and supplied it with critical footnotes , citations from contemporary authorities , and voluminous appendices , it might not fear comparison with such classics in their field as
Villari	PERSON	's biographies of
Savonarola	LOCATION	and
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the general reader will not regret the absence of this criticaj apparatus , especially as its place is taken by a series of excellent illustrations drawn from the Florentine art of the period .

		The Search for What Is Close AT Hand .

		* Many who have got away from
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	in the last few years , or from whom he has got away , will be glad to get back to him by way of '' The Blue Bird . ''

		There were those who had read with a curious delight the strange little early pieces , the romantic dream-fantasias like '' Pelleas et Melisande , '' and the more definite adventure of ''
Monna Vanna	PERSON	, '' who did not readily follow him in his studies on bees and flowers , or on social justice and social reform .

		Here , however , the merely light-minded will * The Blue Bird .

Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		again find something of that which they enjoyed a long time ago . ''

		The Blue Bird '' is certainly a very charming piece .

		I do not know whether it has been acted , or if so how it succeeded upon the stage , but certainly as we have it in the book -LRB- excellently translated by Mr.
de Mattos	PERSON	, as are many other of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's books -RRB- , it makes as real and as intense an impression as did any of
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck 's earlier successes .

		It is true it appears to us under the guise of a slight , a trivial piece , a fairy play , something perhaps for the children at Christmas-time .

		But of course we understand that a man need not become serious , need not be in deadly earnest , in order to do something worth doing . ''


Peter Pan	PERSON	, '' for instance , is a slight child 's play , but it misses only by a little being a very wonderful and beautiful piece .

		And so , on the other hand , many plays much more serious and much more important in form and topic than ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' or '' The Blue Bird '' become , with all their serious importance , things that nobody can bear to see or read a second time -- perhaps not even a first .

		Of course a fairy play is rather after our earlier idea of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, -- not that his earlier plays were fairy plays , but they had a certain independence of ordinary conditions -LRB- most of them -RRB- that was much the same thing .

		A fairy play will permit all sorts of dramatic conveniences , but then so did many of
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck 's earlier plays .

		This play , however , is freer than were they ;
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	perhaps has not in mind so much of dramatic theory as in earlier days .

		It is also fuller of thought , perhaps because , not having certain definite ideas to express ,
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	is the better able to express the wealth of ideas on things in general which the last few years have brought him .

		Certainly the main idea is not profound .

		Two children are sent by the Fairy Berylune to search for the Blue Bird which her little daughter wants .

		They seek in all manner of strange places and return to find the Blue Bird in their own backyard .

		It is not on any such main idea -LRB- how often has that particular one been presented to us -RRB- that the play depends , but on the opportunity which such a theme gives the author for suggestive and subtle remarks and analogies .

		The children start off accompanied by the Dog and the Cat , by Bread and Sugar , and by Light .

		It is very possible , of course , that with a heavier hand all this would simply be conventional and stupid ; but with
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	it is full of genius , evinced in the first frantic leaps and jumps of the Dog , and
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 the self - considering ceremoniousness of the Cat .

		We see at once that we have here no lay figures presented merely to point a moral and adorn a tale , but real creations , real dog and cat .

		With such companions the children set out .

		The boy wears a green hat with a shining diamond in the cockade : turn it and one sees '' into the life of things . ''

		And first they come to the
Land of Memory	ORGANIZATION	, where are the dead who pass the days in peaceful sleep except when we remember them ; and here they rouse their old Granny , and old
Gaffer Tyl	PERSON	their grandfather , and their little brothers and sisters .

		`` Yes , we get plenty of sleep , while waiting for a thought of the Living to come and wake us , '' says
Gaffer Tyl	PERSON	. ''

		Ah , it is good to sleep when life is done .

		But it is pleasant also to wake up from time to time . ''

		Then they come to the
Palace of Night	ORGANIZATION	, still searching for the
Blue Bird	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are led on by Light .

		The Cat runs on ahead -LRB- familiar with the region -RRB- to warn Night that Man is getting at the secrets of things .

		The Cat is a conspir - ator , but the Dog is a great galloping friend .

		So the children wish to look in
Night	ORGANIZATION	's closets , searching for the
Blue Bird	ORGANIZATION	.

		Poor Night !

		She has but few terrors left , -- a few poor Ghosts and Sicknesses .

		Then to the Forest among the Trees ; and here again the Cat would betray the children , -- children as they are of the old wood - cutter .

		And here the Trees and the Animals would overpower the children , judge them , and put them to death .

		But the Man single-handed is too much for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		And then they come to the
Graveyard	ORGANIZATION	, to ask of the dead who lie there about the Blue Bird ; and as twelve o'clock soimds there rises from the gaping tombs a sort of evanescent mist , but there are no dead .

		And then they come to the Kingdom of the Future , where live those who are to be born in days to come , children with all sorts of things that they are to bring to earth , -- inventions , crimes , and other wonders .

		But still no
Blue Bird	ORGANIZATION	.

		And then they find themselves back again in front of their own house , and Bread and Sugar leave them , and the Dog and the Cat become silent , and Light says good-bye , and they wake up and find the Blue Bird in their cage at home , and give it to an old neighbor to please her little girl .

		All this is fanciful enough , one will easily see ; but also it suggests , or it may suggest , so much more than it says .

		It opens to us a new world , a world of apprehensions different from those of every day , that was always
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck 's world , -- a world in which we can speak to the dog and the cat , a world in which we can see those who are gone and those who are to come , a world in which we can enter into the life of the trees and of the beasts of the field , and of night .

		That is a world of which
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has spoken much of late , of which others have spoken too .

		In `` The Blue Bird '' he presents to us in suggestion and in symbol much that has perhaps crossed our minds in more definite and serious thought .

		This , I rather think , is what the drama can well do and is at its best in doing .

		A play is not , I believe , a very good opportunity for the argument of causes , and I have always thought that problems in plays were rather out of place , -- at least if we wanted solutions to them .

		Yet it is not quite enough either that a play shoidd stir our sentiments , our emotions , our passions at random and without connection with our more rational moods or moments .

		But though it is no place for argument , the drama gives a won - derful opportunity for putting ideas into actual forms , into figures and actions so suggestive , so poignant , so appealing , that they remain in our minds with an impressiveness that no argument can equal .

		If a play does that , it fulfils one great possibility of the drama , whether it do it by a child 's fairy-tale or a tragedy of everyday life .

		The great dramas generally do stand in our minds for something , or else they give us figures or situations that stand for something .

		And according as this something is more or less worth while , and more or less seriously impressed upon us , why by so much do we value the drama .

		Hence one will read '' The Blue Bird '' with more attention to the moments of intense appreciation and intuition than to questions of technique and structure .

		Such , indeed , has always been the case with
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, although he would at times have had it otherwise .

		But never has it been more so , nor has such care been more rewarded , than in his latest play .

		liiNCOLN 's Last Days and Death .

		* The additions to Lincoln literature due to the centenary celebration include two volumes closelyrelated , although emanating from different sources .

		That each has for its theme the death of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is a testimonial to the public interest in every detail of '' our most original American , '' as well as an illustration of the painstaking methods of historical investigation of the present • The Assassination op
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and Its
Expia	LOCATION	- Tion .

New York	LOCATION	:
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, day .

		The tragic nature of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's taking-off , as well as the preeminent position he occupied at the time , are warrants against the possible charge of gratifying a morbid curiosity .

		The two volumes under consideration vary widely in treatment .

		Mr.
De Witt	PERSON	's will appeal more to the student , while Miss
Laughlin	PERSON	's will attract rather the general reader .

		The one approaches the subject in the mood of the jurist who tests every point ; the other in the attitude of the witness who gives a narrative .

		The one dwells largely on the crime and trial of the '' conspirators '' ; the other , on the harrowing incidents of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's last days .

		Both denounce the injustice of the trial , and both criticize President
Johnson	PERSON	for withholding clemency after it .

		Mr.
De Witt	PERSON	is severe upon the government for failure to punish
Boston	LOCATION	Cor - bett , the slayer of Booth , who , '' unrebuked , left the stand to start on a triumphant tour over the North , everywhere welcomed as an avenger of blood .

		He received his proportionate share of the reward for the capture , notwithstanding -LRB- if his story is to be believed -RRB- it was his own wanton act that saved the captive from paying the penalty of his crime . ''

		He is severe also in his arraignment of the action of those in authority during the '' reign of terror '' imme - diately following the assassination .

		The prose - cution , he says , exercised a '' cruel ingenuity '' in its activities . ''

		Death had snatched an arch-assassin from their grasp ;
Payne	LOCATION	, Atzerodt and
Herold	PERSON	they might have hung ' in a corner , ' with none to call in question the validity or justice of the process .

		But an expiation so unspectacular would have been but a sorry afterpiece to a world-historic tragedy .

		To fill the measure of the people 's vengeance , they must bring within the sweep of the sword of the republic every participant , high or low , far or near , active or passive , from the fugitive president of the moribund Confederacy , his cabinet ministers , and his agents in
Canada	LOCATION	, down to the lackey who swept out the building within whose guilty walls the tragedy was enacted . ''

		Of the trial , held in the casemates of
Fortress Monroe	ORGANIZATION	, the author says : '' The brutality of loading down with fetters the seven male prisoners , guarded as they were , while in the presence of their judges , passed with indifference if not with positive approval -- so cruel was the humor of the time ; but the presence of a helpless woman in that iron - bound row before a court composed of nine officers of the army with swords by their sides , sent a shock through the civilized world ... Indeed , throughout the entire trial the commission acted upon the theory that false swearing was to be expected from any witness for the defence who had participated in the rebellion either in word or deed . ''

		The validity of the trial before the
Military Commission	ORGANIZATION	, composed of officers of the army .

		is attacked , and instances are cited where the '' common law of war '' was held by the highest court to be beyond the power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to grant or the President to exercise .

		A special chapter is given to '' The Dwindling of the ' Great Conspiracy ' '' charge , at a later time , when
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was attempting to fasten upon President
Johnson	PERSON	the responsibility for the crime in order that he might succeed to the presidency . ''

		To this ignominious end was brought the ' Great Conspiracy ' which
Stanton	PERSON	heralded to the world on the morning after the assassination .

		It accomplished noth - ing in furtherance of the purpose for which it was fab - ricated .


Jefferson Davis	PERSON	-- all hope of trying him by military commission being abandoned -- was siu-ren - dered by the military to the civil authorities , and admitted to bail on an indictment for treason ; Clay had been released on parole a year before ;
Thompson	PERSON	and
Sanders	PERSON	and
Tucker	PERSON	and
Cleary	PERSON	were roaming at will , forgotten if not forgiven .

		The sole result of its blind advocacy on the part of the prosecuting officers was to sweep within the purview of the judgment of the court the woman who stood at the bar with
Payne	PERSON	,
Atzerodt	LOCATION	, and
Herold	PERSON	; and to banish to a prison on the
Florida	LOCATION	reefs four men , all of whom but the one who died of yellow fever , were about to be pardoned . ''

		Miss
Laughlin	PERSON	's volume presents a plain nar - rative of the facts connected with the assassi - nation , the trial , the execution , and the im - prisonment of the alleged accomplices , without attempting judgment .

		The narrative occupies but little over half the volume , the remainder being given to Appendices , causing an unfor - tunate lack of balance .

		Many of these additions are less than two pages in length , and frequently are not germane to the general subject , thus emphasizing the impression that they are ves - tigia of the note-book .

		Nevertheless they con - tain matter of general interest .

		The illustrations , copies of originals , are in many cases remotely connected with the title of the volume .

		If the author of the first volume here reviewed has the advantage in point of authenticity and research , the second easily surpasses in style of composition .

		The first has an exasperating habit of changing the narrative from the past to the present tense , a style at one time supposed to add to liveliness of narrative , but now gen - erally abandoned save in bombast .

		The same authorities are used by each , being the official documents of the trials and the narrative of the various parties concerned ; each author rejects the many exaggerated stories concerning the disposition of the body of Booth , and each con - signs it to a grave dug beneath the pavement in the ground-floor of the old Penitentiary in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 299 Briefs on
Ketv Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English and their traits have Sn ` ffJSman ! '' ' ''

		always interested us , whether por - trayed and commented upon by some philosophic
Emerson	PERSON	, or '' written up '' in journalistic style by a newspaper man after a week 's tour of the island kingdom .

		Mr.
Price Collier	PERSON	, with thirty years ' acquaintance of John Bull and his peculiar - ities , has issued a goodly volume embodying his matured opinions and convictions regarding a num - ber of things British , and has entitled his book '' England and the English from an American Point of View '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In his penultimate para ^ graph he deliberately asserts of our transatlantic cousins that '' if they were not so parochial , if they did not so confidently believe , as Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	once said , and as some of their statesmen have broadly hinted many times since , that ' aU foreigners are mostly fools , ' they would be much nearer a realiza - tion of '' certain wholesome truths than they now are .

		He shows us the dominant and domineering Briton , heavy , beef-fed , substantial , as irresistible as he is massive and deliberate , holding imperial pos - session of one-fifth of the earth 's land-area , and exercising imperial rule over twenty-two per cent of its population .

		Speaking of the English love of law and order , their discipline , their unquestioning obedience to authority , the writer says : '' No wonder the average Englishman can not be terrified , or even aroused , to take decent precautions against invasion .

		They do not need the training of other peoples .

		They are already trained .

		When I see this quality of the race I smile to think what would become of a hundred or two hundred thousand Germans landed on these shores , with their maehine-like methods , their lack of initiative , and their dependence upon a bureaucracy .

		They would be swallowed up , or dispersed like chaff . ''

		And yet other men , even cool heads like Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, are not just now smiling at the thought of what might happen in such a contingency .

		But no sane person can wish the matter brought to a test .

		Mr.
Price	PERSON	's book contains , first and last , a good many statistics , and he twice states the population of
London	LOCATION	, -- first as `` some four million six hundred odd thousand inhabitants , '' and again as 7,113,561 .

		The book leaves an impres - sion of fairness , even of warm friendliness , toward the English , and of carefully matured opinions and well-informed judgments on a number of timely and interesting topics .

		Mr.
P. F. William Ryan	PERSON	's study of '' Queen Anne and Her Court '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a work of exceptional interest .

		The first volume carries the narrative on from the Restoration in
1660	DATE	to the close of
William	LOCATION	in .

		's reign forty years later ; the second is devoted to developments during the reign of Anne .

		The purpose of the author is to describe the personal phases of palace life , political matters being noted only where they are directly influenced by the course Side-lights on the court of Queen Anne , of domestic events .

		The work is , therefore , neither a history nor a biography , as no attempt is made to give a complete or connected account either of the period generally or of the life of
Anne Stuart	PERSON	.

		The author has selected a series of dramatic episodes and interesting situations to each of which he generally gives a separate chapter .

		Selection of a sort that omits what is prosy or dull and includes only such matters as have an abiding human interest can not fail to produce a readable narrative , and Mr.
Ryan	PERSON	's volumes are exceedingly readable ; but the result will hardly take the place of sober history .

		For a work of this sort the later Stuart period offers splen - did opportunities : for devious diplomacy , intellectual brilliancy , elastic morals , questionable ambitions , and consummate treachery , the age has long been famous .

		Of the doings of this age , the author writes in the style of the sensational novelist , a style that seems well adapted to the subject matter .

		Never - theless , he apparently wishes to have his story taken seriously , for he has evidently made considerable use of primary sources , such as diaries , memoirs , and letters -- especially the letters written by Anne to her sister
Mary of Orange	ORGANIZATION	.

		His fancy , however , is not always under proper restraint ; but as he employs it principally in describing weather conditions , park scenery , and the agonies of love and lovers , his imag - inative flights are harmless as a rule .

		Mr.
Ryan	PERSON	is not sympathetic toward the age that he describes , and his chapters consequently can not be relied on for a fair and impartial impression or estimate of the great men and women of the period ; but as side lights on the court of the later Stuarts they will prove of great interest and of considerable value .

		Mr.
Edward Harrison Barker	PERSON	's vol - ume on `` France of the French '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- meets a want which , if not yet long-felt , is none the less genuine .

		It is easy to find information with regard to the French of yesterday and the remoter past , but a reference book on the French of to-day has a distinct value .

		The term '' reference-book '' is used advisedly : Mr.
Barker	PERSON	's volume is a small cyclopaedia of things French , with logical division and chronological sub - division instead of the customary alphabetical arrangement .

		Ten of its fourteen chapters are lists of biographies , in which the subjects are grouped as '' Statesmen and Politicians , '' '' Painters , '' ''
Sculp	PERSON	- tors , '' and so on ; and the list of names is so long that few individuals are allowed more than a short paragraph or two .

		Every work of so condensed a character must do violence to the truth by stating its conclusions too categorically -- or fail to leave defi - nite impressions , as Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's `` French and English '' fails ; but Mr.
Barker	PERSON	is so quiet and well - bred in his assurance , that it seems impertinent to question him , even when he denies that the French are frivolous , or when he insists on the unsurpassed depth and genuineness of their '' home feeling . ''

		Other writers have ventured to discuss the subject from a second-hand acquaintance , or perhaps a fly -
France	LOCATION	and the French of to-day .

		300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ing trip to
Paris	LOCATION	; Mr.
Barker	PERSON	has lived in various parts of
France	LOCATION	for thirty years , and speaks from personal knowledge .

		He writes well , and seems to have thought maturely on the most widely separated subjects .

		He has a very definite opinion on every matter that comes within the broad boundaries of his book , from the symbolism of
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	's statuary to the value of Dr.
Metchnikoff	PERSON	's discovery concerning phagocytic cells .

		He concludes with a statement heard frequently from the other side of the channel , which it should warm the French heart to hear echoed across the water : `` There are no two nations in
Europe	LOCATION	with such community of aims , views , aspirations , and political interests as have the French and the English . ''

Nogi	PERSON	corresponds to the
Hennessey	PERSON	of the
Dooley	PERSON	sketches .

		The letters have already been enjoyed by readers of ''
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly , '' but they bear collection and republication unusually well .

		Being written by a Californian with an intimate knowledge of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	Japanese immigrant and his ways , the book naturally touches upon the strained relations now existing between the
Occi	PERSON	- dentals and the Orientals there brought into contact ; and as there is no better harmonizer of differences than a good laugh , these laughter-provoking letters should serve a pacificatory purpose .

		From an early letter -- they are all , be it noted , ostensibly as well as really written for newspaper publication -- we quote
Hashimura	PERSON	's very reasonable .

Heinemann	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	;
Paul Reynolds	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- , the editor ,
Miss S. Sophia Beale	PERSON	, explains that the Spinster Aunt was not a celebrity , but only a quiet , observant person , who , through letters and a diary -LRB- covering the period from
1847	DATE	to
1882	DATE	-RRB- , has left a desultory record of her observa - tions and impressions of a number of interesting people , things , and places .

		The contents of the book are too varied in subject to catalogue .

		In a charm - ingly unconnected fashion are recorded the child 's first ideas of ''
Don Giovanni	PERSON	, '' of the Queen and Prince
Albert	PERSON	, and of the opening of
Crystal Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then follow the art student 's impressions of
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	; and we are shown glimpses of an intimate acquaintance with the art of
Europe	LOCATION	, with English politics , letters , religion , and music , all in the simple personal narrative of an evidently unusual and inter - esting woman .

		Some of the twenty chapters could be skipped without loss , but three or four sections have elements of real power : the letters written in
Paris	LOCATION	at the time of the Franco-Prussian war picture the situation with vivid reality , -- the weak Emperor hoping to gain popularity through a final coup d'etat , the excitable Parisians confident of victory until with the gradual realization of their position there came the quick reaction of sentiment .

		Added to this is the very human interest in the English art student , a girl quite alone in a city bitter against foreigners .

		To the catholicity of interests is added an unusual lucidity and delightful simplicity of style .

		A useful compendium setting forth A iurvev of , ^ - i • i education , the successive contributions to the bv a Japanese , ideals that have influenced the educa - tion of man comes from such an imexpected source as a Japanese student at an American university .

		Dr.
Tadasu Misawa	PERSON	, in the compass of three hun - dred pages , sets forth , forcibly , clearly , and devel - opmentally , the problems of '' Modern Educators and their Ideals '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		He begins with
Comenius	ORGANIZATION	and ends with Dr.
Harris	PERSON	and President
Hall	PERSON	.

		The survey is of educational ideals , not of methods or measures or institutions , and keeps con - sistently to the task .

		The contrasts and individu - alities of the thinkers are well handled ; and the reader takes away the very vital impression that the systems presented grew out of much the same sets of intellectual problems through the increasing purpose of the ages .

		It is certainly a creditable achievement for one of such alien heredity to enter so sympathetically yet discerningly into the spirit of the modern thought that has expressed one phase of its purpose and interests in the realm of educa - tion .

		The work is concise and commendable .

Burbank	PERSON	's oft-recorded achievements .

		The first author quotes largely Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	's own words , his own account of results attained , and simply credits the gardener with an artist 's genius in putting into practice the principles of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Kellogg	PERSON	tells us the same things , cites many of the same facts by way of illustration , declares that Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	has brought to light no new principle , but has excelled all other experimenters among plants by his delicacy of touch , his boldness , and the magnitude of the scale on which experiment is conducted .

		Each author contributes also a vorwort , or introductory note ; the first a biographical appreciation , the second more nearly prefatory .

John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the author of '' In a Tuscan Garden . ''

		The writer is an amiable , cultured , travelled woman , who deliberately lays claim to advancing years , and allows her pen to wander with entertaining inconsequence from
Jackie	PERSON	, a beloved cat , to the moral regeneration of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The spirit of the first part of the book may be caught from the printed summary of Chapter I. : '' How
Eugenio	PERSON	broke the Gamberaia Pot and came to a Bad End -- Antonio the Childlike and Bland -- The Cow that died and lived again -- Additions to the Live-stock . ''

Switzlerland	LOCATION	.

		The volume is frankly unambitious ; but if one cares to read in the writer 's spirit , an hour with its pages will give much quiet enjoyment .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
C. H. Grandgent	PERSON	is preparing for ''
Heath	PERSON	's Modern Language Series `` an annotated edition of `` The Divine Comedy , '' and the '' Inferno '' volume is now at hand .

		This appears to be the first American edition of the poem to be presented in the orthodox text-book form for the use of college students .

		The notes are at the bottom of the page , and not voluminous to overburden readers ; each canto is prefaced by an '' argument , '' and there is a condensed and useful introductory essay .

		Dr.
C. B. Thompson	PERSON	has offered church workers a very careful study , within certain limits , of the attitude of wage-earners toward the church and religion , and the duty of those who are identified with these institu - tions .

		It voices a call which ought to be heeded .

		The author discusses the alienation of the wage-earners from the churches , the attitude of the churches toward the workingmen , institutional methods , missions , settle - ments , and Christianity and socialism .

		In his crit - icism of socialism the author is not always happy and critical , although he means to be fair .

		The recom - mendations for practical methods in the latter part of the book are suggestive but do not carry us very far into details .

		Professor Henry
Rogers Seager	PERSON	's '' Political Econ - omy '' is a briefer treatment of the science than is given in the author 's '' Introduction to Economics . ''

		It is a book fitted to provide a rather stiff course for high schools , and a fairly satisfactory one for colleges .

		Clear - ness of statement , logical cogency , and the quality of up-to-dateness are the distinguishing marks of this admirable treatise , which we take pleasure in commend - ing .

		Messrs.Henry
Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		In Sir
Arthur Clay	PERSON	's translation of
M. Leroy Beau	PERSON	- lieu 's '' Collectivism '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , English readers are enabled to come into contact with one of the ablest economists of modern life .

		Beaulieu is known as an individualist of somewhat extreme type , but he is intelli - gent and critical in his analysis of the teachings of the socialists .

		Making proper allowance for his bias , one may trust the descriptions and definitions of this writer as fairly representative .

		With the enormous growth of socialistic thought and action in
America	LOCATION	, this translation of a classic comes at the right time and deserves attention .

		A new book by
Canon Barnett	ORGANIZATION	and Mrs.
Barnett	PERSON	is wel - come at this time , because they both have dwelt among the people of
London	LOCATION	and studied their needs .

		The present collection of '' Essays toward Social Reform '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covers the subject of social reforms , pov - erty , education , recreation , and housing .

		Of course these papers are written from the standpoint of a care - ful and sympathetic observer of English conditions , but there is in them a universal human element which gives them more than common interest for us in
America	LOCATION	, where the same problems are pressing for solution .

		To most people it will seem strange to think of
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	as a shy , sensitive , companionable , warm-hearted man , fond of children and adored by them .

		We have come to admire him as a statesman of rugged honesty , wisdom , high ideals , and splendid fighting qualities ; we now see through the revelations of those who knew the man that he was one to be loved as well as to be admired .

		The little book , `` Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	: A Personal Impression , '' by Mr.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	, a friend and neighbor of the former President , gives a charming portrait of the man in his later years , that shows him lovable as well as great .

		Measure for Measure , '' '' The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	, '' and `` All 's Well That Ends Well , '' edited by the
Misses Charlotte Porter	ORGANIZATION	and
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, are late additions to the `` First Folio Shakespeare , '' now about half complete .

		The Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	are the publishers . ''

		The Color of
Rome	LOCATION	'' is the title of an important illustrated book which is in preparation by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for publication this year .

		It is the work of Mr.
O. M. Potter	PERSON	, and will be profusely illustrated from water-color drawings and sepia studies by the Japanese artist ,
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	.

		The
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	issues its annual report in a thin pamphlet whose seven sections , called '' exhibits , '' attend strictly to business .

		The essential facts of the year 's work and the year 's growth are stated with no waste of words , the librarian 's report occupying but two pages .

		The longest '' exhibit '' is the list of donors and their donations , covering seventeen pages .

		From the printed '' statement of assets , '' wherein is set down a balance in bank of thirty-six thousand dollars , it is manifest that the library continues to enjoy material prosperity .

		A bibliography of
Trenton	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, based upon mate - rial in the local public library , and making a pamphlet of twenty-eight pages , has been prepared and published by the library authorities .

		Among much of honorable record in the city 's history , the patriotic Trentonian will read with some shock to his civic pride that before the place took its present name from
William Trent	PERSON	-LRB- ob .


Dec. 29 , 1724	DATE	-RRB- it was contumeliously styled '' Little - worth . ''

		The following books , not previously announced , will be published by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	next month : '' Military Hygiene , '' by Maj .

		Percy
H. Ashburn	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	; `` Economic Heresies , '' by Sir
Nathaniel Nathan	PERSON	; `` Mon - cure D. Conway : Addresses and Reprints , 1850-1907 '' ; and ``
Charles Edward Garman	PERSON	: A Memorial Volume . ''

		The new edition of '' The Life and Letters of
George Ticknor	PERSON	, '' announced by this house , has been postponed until the
early autumn	DATE	.

		The new Hbrary law passed by the
Vermont	LOCATION	legisla - ture considerably enlarges the
State Library Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion 's powers by authorizing it to render more substantial aid to struggling town libraries and to hold each year a school of instruction for such library workers of the state as may choose to attend ; '' and the necessary expense of each such librarian in attendance ... may be paid by the town , city or incorporated village in which said librarian is employed . ''

		Vermont is little in area and population , but big in public spirit and in its devotion to the education and enlightenment of its people .

		The Sunday-opening movement agitated by those who have at heart the best interests of the humbler fre - quenters of public libraries , museums , and art-galleries , has received something of a set-back where one would least expect it .

		The city of Maiden , a suburb of
Boston	LOCATION	, has found its extension of library and art-gallery priv - ileges to
Sunday	DATE	visitors so little appreciated , and so inadequately supported by municipal appropriation of funds for the purpose , that it has been regretfully dis - continued by the board of trustees of the combined public library and gallery of art .

Jennie Allen	PERSON	is neither a conscious humorist like the former , nor an uncon - scious philosopher like the latter .

		In her make - up is combined the best of both , with the result that she is more agree - able than either , and her great charmi is that she is not a bit too good to be true .

		The Nation says : '' As charming a piece of light fiction as one is likely to come across in many a day .

		It is a story of mystery , handled very skilfully .

		Those desira - ble elements in a tale of this kind -- suspense and suspicion -- are to be had in abounding measure .

		Merely as a book that refuses to be laid down until it is finished , it has a clear title to success .

		It possesses in addition exceptional charm of style . ''

		The Atlantic Monthly says : `` The book is amazingly clever , with that rapid speeding action that seems to have come into fiction along with the motor-car .

		Multiplication is vexation .

		Division is as bad ; The Rule of Three perplexes me -- '' So runs the old rhyme , and so , we imagine , any young bachelor would feel , who like

May 16	DATE	, SOME ACROSTIC SIGNATORES OF
FRANCIS BACON	PERSON	Now for the first time deciphiered and published by WILLIAM STONE BOOTH This book contains a collection of photographic facsimiles of pages of Elizabethan and Jacobean texts .

		Facing each facsimile is an expository diagram of the acrostic signature concealed in the type .

		Thus the reader can easily check and verify with precision every acrostic .

		The book is an array of facts of the plainest sort .

		The facsimiles are in the main from first editions of the Shakespeare poems and plays , to which it has been discovered that the name of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	is signed , by these acrostics , in corresponding places .

		That the ciphers are not accidental can be determined by a simple mathematical calculation .

		An inference that may be drawn from the contents of this book is that
Francis Bacon	PERSON	was responsible , as author or part author , for the publication of '' The Art of English Poesie '' and of the works which were published under the name of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	; that he acquired and rewrote old plays ; that he was satirized as a `` Poet-ape '' and as '' Chevr 'll the Lawyer '' by
Ben Jonson	PERSON	; that he was satirized as '' Labeo '' by
Joseph Hall	PERSON	; that in two instances he used the name of

		The second
National Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	was held in
Chicago	LOCATION	during the early days of the present month .

		Its sessions occupied three full days , and were so largely attended that it was found necessary to hold two or three meetings in dif - ferent halls at the same time , in order to accom - modate the throngs of people who , whether from earnest interest or from mere curiosity , came from near and far to listen to the gospel of good will toward men .

		Numerous organizations all over the country were represented by official delegates , and many speakers of great distinc - tion , including diplomatic officials of several for - eign nations , contributed to the programmes .

		Even the local newspapers found the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	worthy of serious attention , and gave it the hospitality of front pages and headlines , along with reports of our ex-President 's exploits in the African jungle .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ended with a huge banquet , attended by upwards of a thousand guests , and was altogether a highly successful affair .

		When one looks back upon an occasion like this , and tries to form some sort of estimate of its power for good , it is only too easy to come to a discouraging conclusion .

		To the news - papers , it is something less than a nine days ' wonder , and when it is over , leaves hardly an echo to remind us that it has been .

		To the public at large , it is the focus of a temporary interest , soon displaced by the jostling of other interests .

		And this incurable vagrancy of atten - tion on the part of the world is apt to react upon the most devoted worker for peace , bringing him perilously close to despondency , and making him wonder if , after all , his effort has been worth the while .

		It takes a stout heart to remain unaffected by the apathy into which most men fall back after their brief excitement is over , to look with hopeful gaze toward the intrenchments behind which foUy and wrong sit in what seems to be the old unimpaired seicurity .

		Menaced by this mood of despair , we need the tonic medicine of the poets , the best friends of man , and the most helpful .

		We need the fire of
Arnold	LOCATION	's exhortation : `` Charge once more , then , and be dumb !

		Let the victors , when they come .

		When the forts of folly fall .

		Find thy body by the wall ! ''

		314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, We need the inspiration of Sill , whose reformer '' Fights alone , and from the cloudy ramparts A thousand evil faces gibe and jeer him .

		Let him lie down and die : what is the right , And where is justice , in a world like this ?

		But by and by , earth shakes herself , impatient ; And down , in one great roar of ruin , crash Watchtower and citadel and battlements .

		When the red dust has cleared , the lonely soldier Stands with strange thoughts beneath the friendly stars . ''

		We need the triumphant vision of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, voiced by his pilgrims of invincible faith : ■ Nay , though our life were blind , our death were fruitless .

		Not therefore were the whole world 's high hope rootless ; But man to man , nation would turn to nation .

		And the old life live , and the old great word be great . ''

		We must all recognize the fact that in any matter that involves the regeneration of the human spirit progress must always be slow .

		The secular iniquity of warfare will not yield to the first assault , or the hundredth ; all we may hope to do at any given time is to sap by ever so little its foundations .

		Here , again , the poet has a word of cheer for us . ''

		For while the tired waves , vainly breaking .

		Seem here no painful inch to gain .

		Far back , through creeks and inlets making .

		Comes silent , flooding in , the main . ''

		The advocate of peace finds himself everywhere confronted by two types of the cynic , the type that refuses to look toward the future , asserting our present miserable estate to be irremediable , and the type that is too impatient to think small steps worth taking at aU .

		It is difficult to say which of the two resists the onward movement with the greater inertia .

		The despair of the idealist is always the man who will cheerfully admit the existence of an evil , agree that the world would be much better for its removal , and refuse to shape his actions in the slightest degree toward that desirable end .

		He is , if anything , worse than the man who , whether plain voter or high-placed statesman , is always ready to pay voluble lip-service to the ideal of peace , but whose every political act favors in - creased taxation for war purposes , and is exerted for the encouragement of the military spirit .

		The hypocrisy or the moral cowardice of this man soon becomes fairly evident to his fellows , and his protests come to be taken at their true value .

		The notion that bristling armaments con - stitute the most effective means of preserving the world 's peace is probably the most mischiev - ous notion at present perverting the minds of men .

		It deliberately ignores the fact that in these armaments is the greatest possible incen - tive to warfare , and that history is full of conflicts brought about by the self-conscious strength and arrogant pride of armed powers , seeking to enforce their unreasonable dictates upon weaker members of the family of nations .

		It is also characterized by a reckless disregard of the economic aspect of militarism .

		The cost of a possible attack is held before the imagination of the populace ; the cost of safeguarding the nation against such an attack is never brought home to the general consciousness .

		If we were calmly to reckon up the two costs , and set them side by side for comparison , we should be far less eager to waste our substance upon the instru - ments of destruction .

		The battlefield takes its toll of wealth and human life in a spectacular way , but the heavy taxation which builds navies and supports armies and pays pensions is quietly taking its toU in the same kind year after year , steadily and remorselessly .

		In the case of our own country , the policy pursued during the past ten years has been a policy of wanton waste , for we can not urge the plea of self-defence which to some extent justifies the European powers in keeping up the burden of their armaments .

		No power upon earth is likely to make war upon the ninety million people of the
United States	LOCATION	, and should that wellnigh inconceivable event become a reality , the amount of damage inflicted upon us could hardly equal the damage we are inflicting upon ourselves in any ten-year period of our present course .

		We should , moreover , as aU the world knows , in the end exact retri - bution to the last dollar for the injury done us by any act of foreign aggression .

		This nation can best aid in furthering the world 's peace by becoming once more the world 's example of a nation resting upon moral ideas , by retracing the downward path of the
last decade	DATE	, by ceasing to share in the senseless rivalry for power that is slowly but surely bankrupting the nations of the older world .

		Turning for a final word to the peace prob - lem in its world-wide aspect , we may say with confidence that the signs have been steadily brightening for years . ''

		Forward then , but still remember how the course of time will swerve .

		Crook and turn upon itself in many a backward streaming curve . ''

		Tennyson 's admonition should keep us from being unduly depressed by temporary happen - ings that seem to put back the hand upon the dial .

		The Hague conferences are solid facts
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 that outweigh in significance any recent exhibi - tions of the military spirit .

		The principle of arbitration is becoming more generally accepted all the time , and the list of its triumphs of recent years -- of possible wars which it has averted -- is , if read intelligently , extremely impressive .

		There is a new hope in the minds of those who love mankind , and it is fed from many springs .

		The questions of peace , the reduction of armaments , arbitration treaties , a humaner code of international law , the federa - tion of nations , and international parliaments and tribunals , are no longer debated with scholastic nicety as mere intellectual exercises ; they are escaping from the academic into the practical sphere , and are being taken seriously by men of affairs .

		Something must result from all this ferment of enlightening discussion , not all that we hope , for many weary generations perhaps , but enough to make us feel that our efforts are anything but futile , to make us fore - see for our descendants a fairer and saner world in which to work out their destinies .

		THE WICKEDEST BOOK IN THE WORLD .

		Not long ago I had occasion to visit an ecclesias - tical library in one of our older American cities .

		To one whose work has been for years under the somewhat deadening influence of the routine of a perfectly-appointed conventionalized modern public library , this day spent in an atmosphere stuffy with tradition and with the things that come with tradi - tion was as a sip of forbidden wine .

		My business with the keeper early finished , he gave me the freedom of his shelves , leading me from one room to another , each in turn a fresh delight to my antiquity-starved soul .

		It was a very patriarch of a library , with old-fashioned shelving from floor to ceiling , laden to the breaking point with the trea - sures of the ages , and these for the most part in their original editions .

		Here were shelf upon shelf of folios dressed in vellum , pigskin , and calf ; of graceful aristocratic quartos in like subdued splendor , and of octavos without number in every sort of bind - ing material known to the craft .

		At last we passed through a dark passage into a room of the width and length of a railroad passenger coach and as high as six of them piled one upon another .

		From floor to ceiling the side walls were made beautiful by a king 's ransom in books -- books of every shape , size , and color , and on every possible subject .

		At either end the light filtered sleepily through Gothic windows of colored glass , obstructed in its passage by the thick ivy which covered the buUding , not sparing even the windows .

		The keeper went with me to one end of the room , and there left me .

		He turned and became one with the shadows of the middle distance , and so went from my sight and memory .

		I moved slowly down one side of the room , recog - nizing old friends here and there , smiling at a memory of this one , taking down another , or reading the title-page or a line or two of a third .

		An irregular line of progress brought me in time to a spot which had been my goal from the moment of my entering the room .

		This was a corner where the ten or twelve lower shelves held what I knew to be a rarely interesting collection of works on a special subject .

		I knew this ; but how , it is not clear even to me , except I know that to those who give their lives to working and playing with books there is vouchsafed in return a subtle power of reading them from the outside .

		I knew this was an unusual collection .

		It looked it , -- that is all .

		Here were
Strozzio Cigogna	PERSON	,
Martin Del Rio	ORGANIZATION	,
Ulric Molitor	PERSON	,
Johann Osiander	PERSON	,
William Perkins	PERSON	, Flood ,
Pomponazzi	LOCATION	,
Salverte	LOCATION	,
Wier	PERSON	,
Bodin	PERSON	, and threescore more , writing on the nature , methods , and history of that great department of human folly known broadly by the terms '' Magic , Sorcery , and Witchcraft . ''

		I scanned a few of the titles with the feeling of wonder and the sense of the mysterious which anything connected with these exploded faiths and theories of our forefathers always engenders .

		I took from its shelf a particularly fine copy of
Martin Del Rio	ORGANIZATION	's Disquisitionum magicarum , lihri sex .

		His engraved title-page held me for a moment ; but muttering , `` lesser men , lesser men , '' I searched the range before me for the master , the father of them all , the
Inquisitor Sprenger	PERSON	, the cursed of many , the arch-fiend .

		There he was , right at my hand , bound in dark - green half-morocco and boards of the same modest and unobtrusive shade , in appearance an indeter - minate sort of book .

		On its back was stamped in severe roman capitals the simple legend Malleus maleficarum -LRB- `` Hammer of witches '' -RRB- .

		Its former owner had bound it in this inconspicuous fashion , it may be , that its individuality might be lost in the high-piled shelves of his great library -- a fitting punishment for its iniquities , which are as scarlet .

		Else would he have covered it with leather stained blood-red , and tooled around the edges and on the back a design of bodies writhing distortedly in pain ; for this is a book of blood and human suffering , of burnings and drownings , of slow death by torture , and of sudden awful death .


Jacob Sprenger	PERSON	!

		The name means nothing to you and me to-day , but not
Herod	PERSON	and not Nero , villianously intentioned though they were , have on their heads or hands more than one small part of the blood and pain that must one day be answered for by this black-browed fanatical tool of popes , this Satan 's whipper-in , who scourged the world in his lifetime and dying left his heritage , this '' maul for the sorcerers '' to carry death and heart-breakings into parts far beyond his mortal reach .

		During his life he swept restlessly through
Germany	LOCATION	and the 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Tyrol	LOCATION	, burning and torturing , sending two or three hundred persons to the stake with every year of his mission .

		The little town of Ravenspurg alone paid toll to the persecution at the rate of ten slaughtered innocents a year for five successive years .

		In one district the convictions were so many that the people rose in rebellion , reasoning perhaps that the death of the sword was a cleaner and a sweeter one than that of roasting in a wood fire .

		What darkening of counsel had this man hearkened to ?

		He was very much of a modern in some ways , was this
Sprenger	PERSON	.

		To-day if king or president commis - sion a man to an unusual field of labor , he makes notes assiduously with the view of publication when his work is done .

		Pope Innocent VIII .

		had laid upon
Sprenger	PERSON	the duty of exterminating the heresy of witchcraft , giving him extraordinary powers that the work might be done quickly and thoroughly .

		After many years of unceasing devotion to the cause ,
Sprenger	PERSON	brought out his book .

		He made a more profound study of the whole subject of the super - natural than anyone had been able to do before him , and the result of his reading and of his observation he compiled into this treatise , the '' Hammer of Witches . ''

		As I looked upon the copy before me , I seemed to enter for a moment a gloomy Inquisitorial cham - ber , where sat the black-gowned tribunal .

		I went out from there in the wake of a fainting wretch who would not confess to having kept in his possession a Baptized Toad .

		He was taken into another room and things were done to him which made my blood chill in its course .

		When he was led back , he con - fessed himself guilty of everything whereof he was accused , and that night he died of his hurts .

		I returned with a shudder to the book in my hand .

		It was as though I were looking in reality upon the hideous machine by which in my vision I had seen a human being twisted and torn to his death ; for this copy of the '' Malleus '' was one of a fifteenth - century edition , published during the life of
Sprenger	PERSON	.

		It may be that he once held this very copy in his hand , and presented it to some younger Inquisitor in order that the flaming torch of ignorance and fanaticism might go down undimmed from one gen - eration to another .

		This harmless looking compound of paper and printer 's ink has doubtless been the death of many a victim of the persecution which sent its tens of thousands of persons to the stake , sacri - fices to the blood-lust , prey of the forces of selfish fear and superstition .

		Reading here , some judge , ecclesiastical or civil -LRB- for both were in it -RRB- , has been convinced for once and all time of the justice of the death penalty for witches .

		Some devil 's advocate , quoting hence , has sent a maiden , torn from her lover 's arms , to the arms of the executioner and the kisses of the flames .

		It has a sinister look , this copy of the '' Malleus . ''

		Its narrow columns of unusually crabbed gothic letters , its soiled pages , its gnawed and blackened edges , make of it an evil-looking volume , -- such a one as that persistent , hot-eyed
Sprenger	PERSON	would fitly be the parent of .

		In appearance it seems to tell of the service it has done ; the dark splotches upon its pages might almost be the blood-stains of its victims .

		Those marginal notes in mediaeval Latin doubtless spell the condemnation of many an honest burgher 's wife or daughter .

		A bundle of paper and printer 's ink it is now , and innocuous ; but what a compact mass of villainy does it represent , this book , the '' wickedest book in the world '' !

		One might read here on almost any page that which would bring a smile to his face unless he remember the piteous throng of those whose bodies twisted and strained at their bonds , shrieking and writhing as the red flames touched their flesh .

		Then he is inclined to regard more gravely the vast credulity and the terri - ble sincerity of the old persecutor , upheld as it was by the banal logic of the age in which he lived .

		Sprenger divides his book into three sections -- treating of what witches are , how to combat them , and how to obtain their sure conviction in the courts of law ; the last , if we may believe him , a very diffi - cult process because of their demonic relationship .

		If there were not in us to-day an attitude of mind toward these things which assures us that they are Folly 's very self , no one reading here could withstand the combined weight of the aggregation of authori - ties and of the mass of authenticated instances of demonic influence which are piled one upon another .

		And it is equally certain that but for the horrible results of the author 's simplicity , no one could read without amusement some of the passages wherein he discusses in aU good faith such mooted points as the possibility of demons exercising their hellish functions among men in the form of animals ; whether they are capable of procreation ; and why women are found practising demonic arts more generally than men .

		In the second book the author is concerned with methods of withstanding the crafts and assaults of the Adversary .

		One refrains from laughing here , too , for through it all runs a childlike faith in God and His Son ; and no matter how absurd the setting , the picture of Faith is never funny , although , as in this case , it may be pitiable .

		He tells of the cooperation one may look for from the angels in this age-long battle , of the power of exorcism inherent in Holy Church , and of the every - day precautions one may take against the loss of homes , human life , and cattle .

		The third book gives the forms of action in the civil and ecclesiastical courts against a person accused of demoniacal relationship .

		It tells how to follow the evil spirit through his transmutations , how to catch him nap - ping , how to entrap him into admissions , of the examination of witnesses , of the amount and kind of torture to be applied .

		The case was to be begun invariably by the notary with the words , '' In the name of the Lord -- Amen . ''

		The radical defect in the character of our fathers of the '' wonderful fifteenth '' century seems to have been the absence of a sense of humor in viewing their own actions and experiences .

		It is conceivable that of a winter 's midnight they should believe them -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 317 selves visited by a succubus , or carried off astride a broomstick to make merry at a Witches ' Sabbath , -- for their houses were gloomy and cold , and their beds hard and not overclean ; but the wonder to us is that in the clear light of the morrow they should insist upon the reality of their night 's experiences .

		Few men are so bold at
midnight	TIME	, even now , as to express a positive disbelief in the supernatural ; but at nine in the morning they will laugh at the idea , and at themselves for their momentary weakness .

		Nobody laughed at
Sprenger	LOCATION	, though , when he published his '' Malleus . ''

		He had the Pope 's appro - bation , and a letter from the faculty of
the University of Cologne	ORGANIZATION	prefixed to the text , the latter instrument expressing unqualified assent to the matter and pur - pose of the book .

		It ran into several editions during his lifetime .

		It found its way into the libraries of the various chapters of the
Holy Office	ORGANIZATION	throughout
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It became the Inquisitor 's vade meeum , his handbook of instructions for daily use ; for dur - ing the next hundred years the heaviest work of the Inquisition was the extirpation of the witchcraft heresy , and this book pretended to show how that could be brought about .

		Sprenger 's book was un - doubtedly a success .

		It probably held its place as a '' best seller '' for several years after its publica - tion , -- and no wonder , for it was racy entertainment indeed compared to the long sermons and the heavy philosophical disquisitions with which the presses of that day were burdened .

		I turned again to the letter of the faculty of
the University of Cologne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its first words were '' In the name of our Lord ,
Jesus Christ	LOCATION	, Amen , '' phrases which flowed readily from the pens of the church - men of that day , and their presence here could be but the conventional use as a form of opening in letters and documents .

		But as I thought more about it , their position as almost the first words in the book became significant .

		For what , if not for
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's sake , was this witchcraft persecution waged ?

		To
Sprenger	PERSON	, all the varied forms of the delusion with which he had come in contact were evidences of the activity of Satan and his legions embattled against Christ and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a pious duty to fight it , -- with the word of God first , and if not successful with that weapon , then with fire and sword .

		We are told by
Lecky	PERSON	,
Lea	PERSON	, and the others who have studied this man 's life , that his was not a cruel disposition .

		If his lines had fallen outside the Church , we should likely never have heard of him .

		Like his father and his father 's father he would have passed into oblivion , a kind husband , a kind parent , a worthy burgher of some German town .

		Perhaps he would even have become an alderman and gfrown fat .

		As it is , he has lived to be cursed -- justly , doubtless , -- but only for doing his duty , or what according to his lights seemed his duty .

		He was deep in ignorance , criminal ignorance ; but his education had not been of the kind that enlightens ignorance .

		How had they , his masters , befuddled his straight-thinking boy 's mind by their scholastic philosophy , with all its pitiful illogic , its syllogfisms and enthymemes , its fallacies and idols , its dialectic disputations , its quiddities and quoddities , its endless controversies about the nature of things which matter nothing -- vanity , vanity !

		It is no great wonder that he and his age lost the clear vision ; that they went mad on the subject of demons , vampires , witches , and diviners .

		His parents had doubtless accepted these things as an article of faith .

		It may be that his mother 's cousin had been burned for attending a '' Sabbath , '' or for sundry other occasions of inter - course with Satan , confessing her guilt after the first half hour of the strappado , willing to acknow - ledge herself Antichrist for surcease from that tear - ing of flesh and wrenching of joint .

		It would have been strange had he not held the beliefs of his age ;
Erasmus	LOCATION	,
Martin Luther	PERSON	, Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	,
John Wesley	PERSON	, Sir
William Blackstone	PERSON	, -- these are some of the men who , with better opportunities than his , have believed in witches .

		We to-day have broken ourselves of the habit of credulity ; that is the difference .

		With my point of view changed somewhat by the byway into which my thoughts had wandered , I replaced
Sprenger	PERSON	's '' maul '' upon its shelf .

		I had taken it down in a sort of rage , calling its author arch-fiend ; but now something of the large charity of that library had entered me .

		It held within its walls all the conflicting opinions of the world , offer - ing to no one of them more space than to another , or more protection against the enemies of books .

		It enclosed them all within its warm dim bosom , and they and it were at peace . ''

		Yonder are brave books , '' I thought , passing to another range .

		I removed from an upper shelf , and bore to the window for better light , a copy of the '' Angelic Doctor ''
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, Super quarto sententiarum , printed , its colophon said , '' by
Nich	ORGANIZATION	- olas
Jenson	PERSON	in
Venice	LOCATION	in

		Praise be to God . ''

		After four hundred and odd years the paper was as white as on the day of its manufacture , the ink as black as in its first moment of impression , and the binding of stamped pigskin stretched over oaken boards was unblemished by scratch or wormhole .

		The types were beautiful and individual .

		Relieving the mo - notony of black against white were blue and red initial letters and paragraph indications .

		Reluc - tantly , -- for time called , -- I was about to put it away , when a single shaft from the setting sun stole through the stained-glass window and fell upon the exposed bosoms of the book .

		The mellow light softened and glorified the contrasted colors .

		I caught my breath in a gasp almost of pain .

		It was a thing of perfect beauty , the perfection of art .

		I closed the book , half ashamed ; I felt as one who has seen Diana naked .

		Unconsciously my thoughts went back to
Sprenger	PERSON	, as I realized that the age which had produced this beautiful book had also burned some hundreds of thousands of human beings .

		Sympathy for and appre - ciation of the fifteenth century , and its forerunners , which men sometimes call the Dark Age , were 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, upon me ; sympathy for the generous error and the misdirected effort that pervaded it -- appreciation of the wonderful accomplishment of which its annals tell .

		This age burnt human beings by the thousand , but it sent its hosts to die for the Sepulchre ; it gave birth to
Caesar Borgia	PERSON	and that dog-brotherhood , but the mild Saint h ,
Kempis	PERSON	is on more men 's tongues to-day , and
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	is overbalanced by
Savon	PERSON	- arola ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	.

		It drew the teeth of Jews to force them to discover their gold , but it nourished Wiclif ,
Chaucer	PERSON	, and the author of '' Piers the Plowman '' ; against its pseudo-scientists , its alchemists , its astrologers , its Mandevilles , it offers
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Copernicus	LOCATION	, and that bold spirit
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	.

		If it was the most short-sighted era in the history of the nations , it was also the most re - splendent with genius , the most prolific in the inven - tion and gi'owth of new arts and sciences .

		It produced such a book as the Malleus maleficarum ; but it perfected the printing-press , the mechanism that was to make its teachings folly and the witch a bogey for chUdren .


Lawrence C. Wroth	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The stylist in journalism is likely to encounter certain embarrassments and difl & culties in the pursuit of his calling .

		As the editor of '' The Spectator '' remarks in a current magazine article -LRB- `` Are Jour - nalism and Literature Incompatible ? ''

		in '' The Fortnightly Review '' for
April	DATE	-RRB- , `` the trade of journalism '' and '' the art of letters '' are not per - haps at irreconcilable odds , but their happy marriage is a difficult matter .

		Plausible reasons readily pre - sent themselves which seem to prove that this mutual hostility is not altogether unfortunate , while on the other hand cogent arguments are not wanting to show that a higher literary tone in daily journalism would greatly benefit all concerned .

		Neither purple patches of fine writing nor labored attempts at bald sim - plicity are desirable , but rather that perfection of lucid literary style which leaves the reader all but unconscious that there is any style at all in what he is reading .

		As an example of the extreme opposite of this , we are tempted to quote , from a large city daily before us , some extracts from a description of a recent fashionable wedding .

		The writer almost attains the height of the ridiculous in some of his florid flourishes . ''

		The science of perception and of the perfection of beauty , '' he begins , '' can not trace its lineage much higher than from the
Brown	PERSON	recep - tion .

		We venture the prediction that this reception will hereafter be accepted as on a footing of equality with the elder branches that have made
Baltimore	LOCATION	beauty so world-famed . ''

		And a little further on : '' We know not what indefinable charm !

		It is as if
Hyperion	ORGANIZATION	, the sun god , the incarnation of light and beauty , had reflected his sweetest rays over the notable gathering of Mr. and Mrs.
Alexander Brown	PERSON	. ''

		And once more : '' There was nothing that marred , but everything that heightened , the perfect presentment of Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	at her daughter 's wedding .

		As she stood upon the dais it seemed to the writer the imperial votress should have been robed in a radiant diamond spangle -LSB- d -RSB- tunic , such as Grseco-Roman matrons wore , with a leopard skin over her shoulders and crowned with an ivy wreath . ''

		As a jumble of choicely inappropriate classical allu - sion and flatulent rhetoric , the entire '' story '' well - nigh achieves the impossible .

		• • • Needed improvements in typography are now on the way , let us hope , to get themselves intelli - gently devised and generally adopted .

		With a view to the prevention of unnecessary eye-strain among readers a movement likely to lead to important results was inaugurated at the
April	DATE	meeting of the
Boston Society of Printers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upon motion of Mr.
Harry Lyman Koopman	PERSON	, librarian of
Brown Uui	PERSON	- versity , a committee was appointed to urge upon the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	Institution the establishment of a depart - ment of research to make scientific tests of printing type , in regard to the comparative legibility of differ - ent letters and the possibility of improving certain of their forms .

		This type-reform movement will meet with more hearty and more nearly unanimous approval than its sister movement for making obso - lete our present spelling-books .

		A little reflection will convince anyone of the wide possibility of im - proving our type .

		Small e is the worst offender of the alphabet , as proved by laboratory tests , while the other six -LRB- t , a , i , n , o , s -RRB- of the seven most largely used letters of the printer 's font are also notoriously bad characters .

		Small i with its dot has a general resemblance to I ; n and u are continually getting into each other 's places ; o and e are insufficiently differentiated ; and a -LRB- not italic -RRB- is often mistaken for s -- in rapid reading , of course , and especially with type or plates a little worn .

		Dr.
Cattell	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	has recommended the use of the script form of small a , and the substitution of Greek lambda for the present small I ; and others have urged the restitution of the old-fashioned long s in an improved form , lengthened below the line , and either the abolition of the dot over the i or its eleva - tion to the level of the top of the letter I .

		These and other suggestions of similar character are not unlikely to result in some reformation -LRB- not too radi - cal -RRB- of our printed alphabet , and thus in the saving of our eyesight .

		, , ,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's view of literature as a profes - sion was not rose-tinted .

		Close on the heels of the publication of his love-letters to
Jane Welsh	PERSON	, and hers to him , comes the auction-sale , this month , of a rather long and important early letter of his ad - dressed to one ''
M. Allen	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, '' who had offered him a secretaryship in case he chose to abandon the struggle to make a living at authorship .

		But although the offer came in the course of what he called '' the three most miserable years of my life , '' he rejected it .

		A brief passage is worth quoting
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 here as picturing the writer 's state of dyspeptic despondency , in describing which , however , he evi - dently took an artistic delight , of a gloomy sort .

		The letter was written in
January , 1821	DATE	.

		`` You asked me lately , '' he says toward the end , '' if I would really take your secretary 's place ?

		And though I felt all the kindness implied in this ques - tion , and though my prospects here are not the most brilliant , my situation not the most comfort - able , I should not have experienced very much hesi - tation in answering no .

		Literature is like money , the appetite increases by gratification ; the mines of literature too are unwholesome and dreary as the mines of
Potosi	LOCATION	; yet from either there is no return -- and though little confident of finding contentment -- happiness is too proud a term -- I must work , I believe , in those damp caverns -- till once the whole mind is recast or the lamp of life has ceased to burn within it . ''

		• • `` Our LiBEBAii LIBRARY RULES are often a sur - prise to those who have not been wont to avail themselves of their public-library privileges .

		The librarian in charge of one of the branches of the
Enoch Pratt	PERSON	Free Library of
Baltimore	LOCATION	tells us , in Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	's current report , of a recent `` novel expe - rience '' of hers . ''

		On two different occasions , '' she says , '' I have been offered payment , or rather a sort of collateral , of one dollar in each case , for a book issued on a card , the borrowers explaining ' they did not think we would trust them with a book , when we knew nothing about them . '

		On explaining to them that their borrower 's card was all they need tO ' obtain a book , they thought it ' a very wonderful system of spreading knowledge broadcast among the many who can not buy it . '

		Do we need a better endorsement of the Free Circulating Library ? ''

		Much other matter of interest will be found in the
Keport	LOCATION	.

		The city , by official action and by amend - ment of its charter , is now about to receive the benefit of Mr.

a million dollars	MONEY	for twenty branch library buildings .

		Incredible as it may seem , last year was the first year in which the city government made an appro - priation for the

		• • • The effect of age on the appetite for read - ing is different in different persons .


Hazlitt	PERSON	says : '' * The greatest pleasure in life is that of reading , while we are young .

		I have had as much of this pleasure as perhaps anyone .

		As I grow older , it fades ; or else , the stronger stimulus of writing takes off the edge of it .

		At present , I have neither time nor inclination for it . ''

		This was written about five years before the author 's death ; but he died at the early age of fifty-two .

		Carlyle , in his later years , often referred in his correspondence to the inferior pleasure derived from reading as compared with the absorbing mental activity of writing .

		On the other hand , old age has brought to many not only increased leisure for reading , but also richer satisfaction in the companionship of books .

		To be sure , much that pleased the youthful reader no longer interests the more mature ; but , in compensation , the latter has acquired a far wider range of interests and memories and associations , and while he is more discriminating he also can find food for the mind in hundreds of books that meant nothing to him in youth .

		The writer who allows his passion for producing books to kill his faculty for getting pleasure and profit from the books of others , is laying up remorse and regret and vacant unrest for his old age .

		• • • A CURIOUS INSTANCE OF FORESIGHT or WaS it merely a happy accident ?

		-- attracts the attention of magazine readers .

		Twenty-five years ago the popular novelist known to all the world as ''
Ouida	PERSON	, '' and to some small part of it as
Louise	LOCATION	de la Ramde , offered the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	two manuscripts for posthumous publication .

		They were accepted , paid for , and put away in the company 's safe , to await the death of the writer , an event which now has released both the gifted woman 's soul from its bondage of clay and the manuscripts from their prison of steel .

		The May number of ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine '' con - tains one of the articles ; the
June	DATE	issue will contain the other .

		They are entitled '' Shall Women Vote ? ''

		and '' Love versus Avarice . ''

		Did the writer foresee the `` suffragette '' of this year of grace ?

		It is asserted that she did , and , moreover , that `` the somewhat startling reasons advanced by
Ouida	PERSON	for the feminine unrest of to-day , and for the social evil that prevails , may be said to justify the author 's unusual stipulation . ''

		, , , Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	's `` hundred worst books , '' an amusing catalogue amusingly annotated , which his readers have been awaiting with some eagerness of interest , and which now appears in the
May	DATE	`` Atlantic , '' is rather disappointingly defective .

		With all its brightness and readableness , the article names only three of the expected hundred awful examples of what a book should not be ; and these three are obscure and otherwise uninteresting works that the writer happened to have in his own library .

		The remaining ninety-seven , therefore , await the kind attention of some other critic or critics .

		A good chapter could be written on really famous and deservedly famous old books that , for various reasons , now have so decidedly negative an attrac - tion for us as to fall easily into the class of the world 's worst literature .

		There is , for example ,
Cudworth	LOCATION	's learned and lauded work , `` The True Intellectual System of tha Universe ; wherein the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is confuted '' -- of whose author
Dryden	PERSON	found it in his heart to say : '' He raised such strong objections against the being of a God and
Providence	LOCATION	, that many thought he had not answered them . ''

		And there is Dr.

May 16	DATE	,
Darwin	PERSON	's poem in quarto on `` The Loves of the Plants , '' which inspired the parody , '' The Loves of the Triangles , '' and which
Byron	PERSON	dismissed as '' pompous rhyme . ''

		To be worthy of inclusion even in a list of worst books , a book should rise to the dignity of literature ; the vast ocean of unregarded printed matter is out of the reckoning .

		A BuifYAN MEMORIAL IN
WESTMINSTER	LOCATION	AbBEY wUl before long , according to present indications , put a stop to those expressions of surprise on the part of visitors , and especially American visitors , that four years ago gave the first impetus to the present movement for supplying a glaring and un - accountable omission .

1905	DATE	that first called general attention to the tardiness of
Banyan	ORGANIZATION	's coun - trymen in rendering him due honor .

		As is acknowl - edged by the English themselves , the lack of any Bunyan memorial in
England	LOCATION	's Hall of Fame was pointed out by American delegates to this conven - tion , and their interposition it largely was that led to the call for subscriptions and the subsequent selection of a suitable memorial .

		The latter will take the form of a window depicting scenes from '' The Pil - grim 's Progress . ''

		A fund of about fourteen hun - dred pounds is being raised , of which more than one-third has already been received or promised .

Crawford	PERSON	's place in literature is being fixed , but not immutably , by current chroniclers of his death and critics of his life-work .

		In facility and rapidity of execution he was little inferior to the astonishingly prolific TroUope ; and like him he wrote , and professed to write , not with a view to producing books that should live after his death , but books that should enable their author to live comfortably until his death .

		Just which one of the lesser novelists of assured fame he stands nearest to on the mountain-slope that leads up to immortal eminence , it is impossible to decide ; but the variety and ingenuity of his work , his wide knowledge of many men of many nations , and his interest in the perennially fascinating problems of occult psy - chology , will win him readers for years to come , and it would not be surprising if his best books -LRB- which in general are his earlier books -RRB- should out - live those of authors now ranked as his superiors .

		Far less can we contemplate with unmingled pity and indulgence this later poet , and husband and father besides , in his last moments of helpless despair .

		• ■ • The PUBLIC library 's three-tenths of a mill -- the tax levy imposed in some communities for maintenance of this department of public educar tion -- constitutes an absurdly small proportion of the whole tax .

		A paltry three-hundredths of a mill !

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		FROM THE LIBRARY COPYRIGHT LEAGUE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It was to be presumed that the passage of a new copyright act by the last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	would end copyright discussion for a time .

		It would please those who have opposed the contentions of the
American Publishers	ORGANIZATION	' Copyright League if the matter could have rested at least until the next session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		We can not allow , however , the glaring misstatements contained in Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's letter in your issue of
April 16th	DATE	to go unchallenged , if only for the sake of truth .

		All of the arguments which he advances were ably presented to the committees on patents , both by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	and the legal advisers associated with him .

		The committees , who gave four years to the study of the subject , and made the fullest examination , recom - mended the new bill imanimously ; it is evident that these gentlemen were not favorably impressed with the justice of the arguments against importation for use and not for sale .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's arguments are , if we understand them , as follows : 1 .

		Importation of copyrighted books is forbidden in
England	LOCATION	, but allowed in the
United States	LOCATION	by the new law .

		The truth is that non-British editions of books originating in
England	LOCATION	are forbidden importation if imported for sale and copyrighted in
England	LOCATION	.

		Pre - cisely the same applies in the new law .

		Foreign editions of books by an American author are forbidden importa - tion by individuals .

		Foreign editions of books by an English author are not forbidden importation into the
United States	LOCATION	, when imported for use and not for sale .

		Foreign -LRB- American -RRB- editions of books by an American author are not forbidden importation into
England	LOCATION	.

		The conditions are absolutely the same , except that libraries are allowed unrestricted importation of single copies of any book in the new
United States	LOCATION	law .

		2 .

		The privilege of importation of copyrighted books for individual use was '' interpolated into the act of
1891	DATE	diu * ing the last hours of the session . ''

		This is simply an absolutely false statement .

		The matter was debated in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	on several occasions .

		Anyone desiring to read the speeches in favor of this provision should examine Vol .

		22 of the
Congressional Record	ORGANIZATION	, beginnmg on
February 9 , 1891	DATE	.

		They will find speeches by Senator
Frye	PERSON	,
Senator Sherman	PERSON	, and others on this very matter .

		3 .

		Mr ,
Putnam	PERSON	cites the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of En - glish Literature as showing the injustice of the law to the American publisher .

		Let us look at the facts .

		This work sells , in the American edition , to the American private student , for
$ 2.50	MONEY	per volume .

		The English edition sells to the English student for seven shillings and sixpence , which at the usual rate of exchange means
$ 1.82	MONEY	.

		To import a copy of the work , through an importer in
New York City	LOCATION	, will cost about
$ 2.30	MONEY	.

		It could not be imported for this price through some of the houses which charge such rates for importation as would be charged '' if imported through the American copyright proprietor . ''

		It can be imported , for a library , for about two dollars , not as Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	says , for more than the American edition costs , '' equally attractive in form . ''

		From many years ' experience , we can confi - dently say that many of our English purchases cost us over twenty per cent less than the best American price , and , as it often has been six months before an American edition is published , we can wear out a copy of the book before the American publisher decides it is a commer - cial success to publish it .

		The English editions are often better .

		4 .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	wants us to import '' under the permis - sion of the owner of the copyright . ''

		This was the '' joker '' on which the publishers chiefly relied to establish a con - trol of prices .

		Suppose the '' owner of the copyright '' asked a price equal to one dollar for every shilling that the book cost in
England	LOCATION	.

		Why shouldn ' t he ?

		Where would the American student be then ?

		Just where the publishers of books have been trying to put him , entirely at their mercy .

		It is a well-known fact that the
American Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	has been trying to increase the price of 822 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, books to '' all the traffic will stand '' for a long time .

		If it had not been for the fear that they wonld be prose - cuted for infringement of the Sherman law , they would have kept up their open agreement to control book prices , instead of as at present doing it under the cover of '' advice to the members . ''

		Frightened by a decision in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in the '' `` retail drug '' cases , they pre - tended to abrogate their agreement in
January , 1907	DATE	.

		They have tried to establish their monopoly by suits at law , by an attempt to have monopoly clauses inserted in the copyright bill , and , as a last resort , their printers asked the
Committee on Ways and Means	ORGANIZATION	to do away with free importation , and raise the duty from twenty - five per cent to
seventy-five per cent	MONEY	.

		They failed in the courts , they failed in the copyright bill , and they will fail in the tariff bill .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	alleges that `` the librarians who have standing arrangements with purchasing agents in Lon - don , find it an inconvenience to instruct these agents to except from their shipments books which are being pro- duced in Copyright American editions . ''

		This state - ment is so remarkable and so contrary to what we know from personal experience of the practice of libraries that Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	ought to give the basis of this statement in order to obtain any credence for it .

		One more point .

		The English author gets less royalty for a copy of his book sold in
America	LOCATION	than for a copy sold in
England	LOCATION	.

		The usual royalty for the colonies and
America	LOCATION	is one-half that for
Great Britain	LOCATION	, just as the royalty for an American avithor for copies sold in
England	LOCATION	is visually one-half that for copies sold in
America	LOCATION	.

		The object of a copyright bill , we have sup - posed , was to secure remuneration to the author .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's prohibition of importation would result in less royalty to the man who wrote the book , and a higher price to the man who wants to read the book .

		It would result in the impoverishment of both for the benefit of an American publisher .

		It would prevent , instead of assisting , the free spread of printed thought .

		No foreign nation has a law which forbids the im - portation of books for use and not for sale .

		A lengthy compilation by the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	establishes this fact , and all the great legal authorities on copyright announce this privilege of importation as existing .

		In
Canada	LOCATION	, such importation is compulsory on the copy - right proprietor .

		These facts should be known , and should not be misrepresented .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's age -LRB- he was bom in

		`` There are , '' he stops to explain at one point , '' many incidents that I could tell about this time of my life that might be interesting in some sense , but which are foreign to the main purpose of such an autobiogTaphy as mine , which is to indicate how the growth of a mind has been affected by circumstances .

		THE DIAL 323 his youth , and he came within a little of becoming a practising physician ; but his father 's death and his own inheritance of a comfortable fortune operated to turn his thoughts toward travel and adventure .

		Consequently , after taking his degree at
Cambridge	LOCATION	and devoting some time to the gentlemanly pursuits of hunting and shooting , he entered upon those
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and African travels and explorations that bore fruit in vari - ous memoirs and addresses and in his first book , '' Tropical
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' and also led to his election as Fellow of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, too , presented him with a gold medal '' for having at his own cost , and in furtherance of the expressed desire of the Society , fitted out an expedition to explore the centre of
South Africa	LOCATION	, and for having so suc - cessfully conducted it ... as to enable this Society to publish a valuable memoir and map in the last volume of the Journal , relating to a country hitherto unknown . ''

		As an African explorer , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	takes occasion to question the seriousness of
Livingstone	PERSON	's situation when the '' New York Herald '' undertook , with such blare of trumpets , his rescue through the instru - mentality of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	.

		He writes : `` I was on the Council of the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	during all the time in question , and can testify to our extreme desire to help
Livingstone	PERSON	, but in his later years he had become difficult to meddle with .

		He had a brusque resentment against anything that might be construed into patronage , feeling , as I understood , that he had been over-much ' exploited ' by his admirers .

		There was great fear by those in the Council who knew him better than I did , that he might be annoyed by any attempt to relieve him , and would resent it yet more bitterly than
Emin Bey	PERSON	subsequently resented
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's compulsory relief .

		Again , there was no reason to sup - pose
Livingstone	PERSON	to be in serious want .

		He was thor - oughly accustomed to natives of the widely dispersed Bantu race , among whom he probably then was .

		He travelled without a large party or other encumbrance , so that the favour of even a single chief , such as he might reasonably expect to gain , would amply suffice for his wants .

		Besides this , he did not care to write , and there was no knowing where a man like him might be , who had already walked right across
Africa	LOCATION	and back again ... One wishes that the whole thing could have been effected with less secrecy in the beginning , and less ostentation and comparison of Americans and English to the prejudice of the latter . ''

		Besides being a pioneer in the systematic study of heredity , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	originated the now accepted system of finger-print identifica - tion -LRB- with which
M. Alphonse Bertillon	PERSON	is often credited -RRB- , and was the first to take up seriously the study of eugenics , or race-improvement .

		The very name '' eugenics '' we owe to him .

		A ellowship and a scholarship have been endowed by him in
London University	LOCATION	for research work in this new science , which is to accomplish much , he hopes , for the amelioration of the human race .

		The theory of the thing is beautiful .

		Let us quote our scientific Utopian . ''

		After I had become satisfied of the inheritance of all the mental qualities into which I had inquired , and that heredity was a far more powerful agent in human development than nurture , I wished to explore the range of human faculty in various directions in order to ascer - tain the degree to which breeding might , at least theo - retically , modify the human race .

		I took the moderate and reasonable standpoint that whatever quality had appeared in man , and in whatever intensity , it admitted of being bred for and reproduced on a large scale .

		Consequently a new race might be created possessing on the average an equal degree of quality and intensity as in the exceptional case .

		Relative infertility might of course stand in the way , but otherwise everything seemed to show that races of highly gifted artists , saints , mathematicians , administrators , mechanicians , contented labourers , musicians , militants , and so forth , might be the - oretically called into existence , the average excellence of each race in its particular line being equal to that of its most highly gifted representative at the present moment . ''

		In one of his chapters the author explodes a popular belief which has even more recently been proved false .

		He tested the delicacy of the touch-sense of a large number of blind children , first promising a reward to those who should display the greatest degree of sensitiveness .

		Accordingly all did their best , '' but their per - formances fell distinctly short of ordinary per - sons . ''

		The experimenter afterward found '' a marked correlation between at least this form of sensitiveness and general ability . ''

		The impressions made by great men on one another are often significant and instructive .

		Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's remembrances of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	contribute some most readable pages to his book .

		The Synthetic Philosopher once accompanied him to the Derby , but had already arrived by deduction at so accurate a conception of the whole event that it failed to interest him .

		He also said that the crowd of men on the grass looked disagreeable , like flies on a plate . ''

		Still , he evidently liked the excursion , and notwith - standing his asseverations at the time to the contrary , he repeated his experience on at least one subsequent occasion . ''

		From each of these men we are now fortunate in possessing a '' human document '' of value , though the later writer has taken himself far less seriously in his autobiography than did his predecessor .

		In visits at
Lord Ashburton	ORGANIZATION	's country place , Mr.
Galton	PERSON	twice met
Carlyle	PERSON	, who on the second occasion seemed to him '' the greatest bore that a house could tolerate . '' ''

		He had a well-known story then to the fore , which
W. H. Brookfield	PERSON	... told me he had indulged in five 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, times that day already , and undertook that he should repeat it for my benefit a sixth time , which he did .

		Then
Carlyle	PERSON	raved about the degeneracy of the modern English without any fact in justification , and contributed nothing that I could find to the information or pleasure of the society .

		He , however , executed a performance with great seriousness which was decidedly funny , by hopping gravely on one leg up and down within the pillars of the portico , which he had discovered to be a prompt way of warming himself in the then chilly weather . ''

		Thus unheroic do our heroes sometimes appear to their contemporaries .

		A line in '' Who 's Who '' informs all whom it may concern that Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's recreations are '' sunshine , quiet , and good wholesome food . ''

		An author with such simple , sensible tastes is more than likely to write in a plain and terse and readable style .

		The straightforwardness and unpretentiousness of Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's book win the reader 's favor and hold his attention to the end .

		The book has the excellent fault of being shorter than one could have wished .

		Such a book is Mr.

Millard	PERSON	has chosen for his book is somewhat misleading , for although about one-third of the chapters deal with various aspects of American interests , fully one-half of the book is devoted to a study of conditions in
Japan	LOCATION	since the war and to Japanese activities in
Korea	LOCATION	and
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		A discussion of re - cent happenings in
China	LOCATION	and a brief reference to the Russians in
Manchuria	LOCATION	complete the book .

		That this emphasis is placed upon
Japan	LOCATION	is due , of course , to the importance of

		any study of the recent history of the Far East , and Mr.
Millard	PERSON	has no doubts as to the signifi - cance of some of her recent actions .

		But in a book dealing with events of such recent date it is necessary that much of the discussion be merely a statement of the opinions of the author .

		And for that reason it is important to know in what spirit Mr.
Millard	PERSON	approached his task of interpreting Japanese activities to the western world .

		In his preface the author states that '' some persons will profess to find in this , as many did in my previous work , an anti-Japanese preach - ment . ''

		But he disclaims any desire to injure
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		I wish the Japanese nation and people success in aspirations which do not tend to cause international dissension and strife by impairing interests of other nations .

		That the present policy of
Japan	LOCATION	has this tendency is a conclusion I have reached after closely observing its trend for several years , and from studying its practical effects in localities where it is directly applied . ''

		So Mr.
Millard	PERSON	's new book may be taken as another thesis designed to prove the dangerous possibilities of Japanese aspira - tions .

		And as with every thesis , the reader must use considerable care in weighing opinions advanced to support the text .

		One does not have to read far to conclude that
Mr MiUard	PERSON	has already decided the case against the Japanese , and that no evidence in their defence need be urged .

		A striking example of his argument , and yet almost a typical one , is his reference to the Emperor . ''

		One hears in
Japan	LOCATION	varying opinions about the personality of the present Emperor .

		Many regard him as the usual figurehead , occupying himself , after Oriental fashion , with sensual pleasures , and leaving the cares of government to his ministers .

		The Crown Prince is generally regarded as being duU , almost a booby , and is not entrusted with responsibility . ''

		That many other people have an entirely different opinion of the Emperor 's personality is not mentioned .

		And this method of argument constantly appears when Japanese acts or motives are under discussion .

		The bad report is given without any reference to qualify - ing opinion .

		Other examples of Mr.
Millard	PERSON	's attitude toward the Japanese might be mentioned if necessary .

		This apparent prejudice is very im - fortunate , because Mr.
Millard	PERSON	has had oppor - tunities to study conditions which are of great interest to the western world .

		But it would be difficult for anyone to accept unreservedly the arraignment of Japanese financial and industrial

		THE DIAL 325 methods , of her conduct in
Korea	LOCATION	and her false - ness in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, when it is based upon such evident lack of sympathy .

		Mr.
Millard	PERSON	tells us that '' in estimating some matters Japanese are a bit out of perspective just now . ''

		Possibly some readers may come to the same conclusion regarding this latest treatment of Japanese policies .

		In dealing with
China	LOCATION	and her problems Mr.
Millard	PERSON	is as sympathetic as he is severe in his treatment of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		He has great hopes for the reform movement . ''


China	LOCATION	can wait for a constitution and representative government .

		... The abolition of extra-territoriality also can wait .

		But recovery of pseudo-political foreign concessions and leaseholds , extension of a modern educational system , the creation of a modern army and navy , chiefly require money ; and to get money
China	LOCATION	must reform her finan - cial and fiscal systems .

		Here , then , is where real reform must begin . ''

		Because of the gen - uine community of interests between the
United States	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	we should adopt '' an aggres - sive policy in
Asia	LOCATION	'' which would serve to strengthen
China	LOCATION	against her enemies .

		But apparently this policy points to the giving of good advice , the stretching out of a friendly hand to support and guide
China	LOCATION	along a diffi - cult path . ''

		The
United States	LOCATION	can assume leadership in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, if an energetic policy is adopted ... and it is probable that unless
America	LOCATION	does again interfere in eastern affairs another great war will occur in a few years . ''

		But in considering the work of the Americans in
the Philippines	LOCATION	Mr.
Millard	PERSON	is not only sym - pathetic but highly optimistic .

		In this case the administration is generally supported against the critics on the spot , and policies and perform - ances are highly praised .

		It is a pleasure to be again reminded that '' American officials and employes of the
Philippine Government	ORGANIZATION	, of high and low degree , constitute a body whose efficiency and integrity is not surpassed , indeed is rarely equalled anywhere .

		It is , I believe , superior in morale and personnel to similar bodies in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The first Philippine Assembly is discussed at some length , and commended , especially for the way it assumed the responsi - bility placed upon it by the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		And even a good word is advanced for the Filipino as a laborer , when handled with tact and dis - cernment .

		This survey of the past few years of the American administration is a most grati - fying one .

		In the chapters entitled ''
America	LOCATION	's Position in the
Pacific	LOCATION	'' we have a discussion of the probable conduct of a war with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		A plea is made for strongly fortified posts in
Hawaii	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	, although if war breaks out within five years
Japan	LOCATION	would confine her en - deavors to an attack on the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Even before the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal is completed the major battleship fleet should be kept on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		Briefly stated , Mr.
Millard	PERSON	finds that the
United States	LOCATION	has great interests in the
Pacific	LOCATION	arising from her trade and her insular possessions , and it will be necessary to play a more important part in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	diplomacy until by her participation a stable balance of power in the
Far East	LOCATION	is created .

		If one could have more confidence in the soundness of Mr.
Millard	PERSON	's views the present work would be of considerable value .

		It is certainly most suggestive , and the style com - mands one 's interest .

		The thirteen appendices , containing the texts of treaties and other papers from the treaty of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	to the Root - Takahira notes , add to the value of the book .

		An index would have been much appreciated .

		As the latest study of Far Eastern politics , Mr.
MiUard	PERSON	's book should be read by all who desire to follow recent developments there , and even if they question the opinions advanced from time to time they can not fail to enjoy the treaty - port gossip which enlivens the pages .

		It is always enjoyable , but rarely convincing .

Century of the Child	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Abundant food for thought and unlimited material for discussion are to be found in
Ellen Key	PERSON	's '' The Century of the Child , '' which has just been translated from the Swedish -- or , more correctly , has just come to English readers through the German by double translation .

		The original was published in
1900	DATE	, and took its title from a saying of one of the characters in '' The Lion 's Whelp '' : '' The next century will be the century of the chdd , just as this century has been the woman 's century . ''

		It is unfortunate that the author 's most radical views , and those that are likely to be thought subversive of morality , are set forth in the opening chapter , which concerns mar - riage and parenthood ; for many readers will be turned aside at this point and miss the chap - ters on Education which are the most valuable part of the book .

		326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, with the matrimonial heresies of this chapter , and will read further , are likely to discover that they were at the beginning introduced to the writer 's greatest weakness as well as to her greatest strength .

		Her strength lies in her abstract ideals for the conditions under which children should be bom and educated ; her weakness , in her apparent inability to recognize and her obvious unwillingness to acknowledge the part which religious and social institutions have had in preparing the world for these ideals and their realization .

		We learn from biograph - ical sketches of
Ellen Key	PERSON	, that she has severed her connection with all organized social move - ments .

		Her book indicates that she has done this with a bitterness of spirit that makes her an unfair critic .

		To illustrate : The '' woman 's rights move - ment '' seems to her to stand only for an effort on the part of women to secure , solely for their own satisfaction , educational advantages and admission to professions and fields of activity from which they have been excluded in the past .

		Th -LRB- ; re is within the movement , as she sees it , no solidarity of spirit except that which has a distinctly selfish purpose .

		To this understand - ing we may not offer objection ; for every per - son has a right to his own definition of a term so elastic as the '' woman 's rights movement . ''

		We may , however , dissent when women as a class , or any class of women , are held responsi - ble for the demoralizing effect of modern factory life upon working women and upon the homes of working people .

		These effects can in fair - ness be charged only to our industrial system , and not to the ambitions of a sex .

		If it is true that the adherents of the woman 's rights movement as
Ellen Key	PERSON	knows it are hopelessly blind to the fact that '' the passion to discover truth must be accompanied by the passion to use it for the welfare of mankind , '' that they are not interested in protective legis - lation for women and children nor in supporting organized efforts of working women to improve their own conditions , then there is for her only one possible line of action ; i. c , to sever her connection with the movement and then to work alone or to form new associations for the pur - pose of gaining opportunity to work effectively in the interests of humanity .

		Individual de - velopment , however , must precede social use - fulness ; and the woman 's rights movement , even in the narrowest conception we have of it , has secured for women the education and the train - ing necessary for efficient organized work in behalf of education , the home , and the child .

		That the coming century is to be the century of the child partly because the century just passed was the woman 's century , is a fact which
Ellen Key	PERSON	fails to recognize .

		It is much the same with her treatment of Socialism .

		It is unfair to commend unreservedly a plan for pensioning mothers during the time their children need their care , without referring to the fact that this is one of the cardinal principles of Socialism ; unfair , also , to accuse Socialists as a whole of obstructing protective legislation , a charge which can be fairly brought against a small section of the party only .

		The writer 's attitude toward marriage is much the same as her attitude toward the woman 's rights movement and Socialism .

		With her high ideals for `` the common living of man and woman , '' she apparently fails to credit the in - stitution of marriage and the legal protections which have been thrown about it with having fostered and promoted these ideals .

		But while we object to many of the conclu - sions of the book , our hearts go out in sympathy to the author , who , a keen observer of life , saw that at the opening of this century -LRB- the twentieth after Christ -RRB- '' the passions of men were still aroused in economic and in actual warfare , '' that '' despite all the tremendous development of civilization in the century just passed , man had not yet succeeded in giving to the struggle for existence nobler forms , '' and that '' Christian people continued to plunder one another and call it exchange , to murder one another eii masse and call it nationalism , to oppress one another and call it statesmanship . ''

		No wonder she was led to criticize the conditions under which the succeeding generations of this slowly developing race have been educated , and also the conditions under which they have been born .

		The chapters on Education redeem the rest of the book , although they contain much that is inapplicable to our system of public instruction , for we have abolished many of the abuses that are mentioned .

		Like
Ellen Key	PERSON	, however , we are still seeking a kind of education which will give to the world '' new types of people with higher ideals , -- travellers on unknown paths , thinkers of yet unthought thoughts , people capable of the crime of inaugurating new ways '' ; and we acknowledge that we have in her not only a companion in ideals but a leader in methods .

		Her chapters on Education are mas - terly contributions to the literature of pedagogy , the result of a profound sympathy with and an understanding of child nature , and of long experience in child-training .

		THE DIAL 327 Except to those who insist upon rejecting as a whole , if they can not accept as a whole , any book that embodies a call to action , '' The Century of the Child '' offers abundant inspira - tion .

		The truth is that it contains a definite programme for woman 's future work , organized as well as unorganized , in the interest of the child .

		This , to be sure , can be read as a whole only by patching together bits that are scattered about among the denunciations of peoples and institutions ; but the book itself is probably much more readable than it would be if the programme were presented in orderly and sys - tematic fashion .

		Some
Very Moderx Types	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.Huneker 's previous studies of personalities in the world of drama and music will prepare the reader for stimulation from his new book with the piquant title : '' Egoists : A Book of Super - men . ''

		The title is perhaps not exact , for not all his egoists are properly to be classed by the name made famous by
Nietzsche	LOCATION	; still , they are as a group characterized by certain stigmata which distinguish , more or less , the men he studies : morbid subjectivity , irregular lives , and brilliant if erratic achievement .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	, with his interest in a field trodden by few critics , is doing a service by this exploitation of writers and thinkers little known and less understood .

		It is perhaps inevitable that he has not entirely escaped the contagion of his theme , and so exhibits traits both of style and thought which are not admirable .

		His diction is all his own , and has its fascination ; but it is an uneasy style , like a rapid series of electric sparks .

		Even hon mots tire unless the law of relief and contrast is obeyed .

		Strange and startling words occur , until the reader is almost stunned ; repetitions are so frequent as to suggest that the author regards them as the bugbear of small minds .

		On the side of thought , this verbal smartness sometimes leads Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	to prefer cynical epigram or the clever half-truth to genuine seri - ousness of statement .

		Discussing Nietzsche , he says : '' Gossip has whispered that he was hope - lessly in love with
Cosima Wagner	PERSON	.

		A charming theme for a psychological novel .

		So was
Von Bulow	PERSON	, once -- until he married her . ''

		Quoting Stendhal 's ' • ' • Femmes I vous etes hien toujours les memes '' he adds these words : '' It is a * Egoists : A Book of Supermen .

		By
James Huneker	PERSON	.

		New quotidian truth that few before him had the courage or clairvoyancy to enunciate . ''

		It woidd indeed be convenient , could the sex be reduced to a formula so simple .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	has made a book that is not only entertaining but helpful .

		His studies are preeminently suggestive and sympa - thetic .

		Those on
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	,
Baudelaire	LOCATION	,
Flau	PERSON	- bert , and
Huysmans	PERSON	are especially informing , and really assist toward an understanding of more or less cryptic creatures .

		Obscure facts are brought to the light of day , and always a lively impression given of a personality hitherto , for most of us , walking in a mist .

		Especially sympathetic are the three studies , '' Phases of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which the apostle of the
Overman	PERSON	is shown to be something besides an inconceivable freak both as man and thinker .

		The Ibsen paper , while it presents nothing really new , is in the main happily interpretative ; the author goes too far in declaring that the play - wright '' lifted the ugly to heroic heights , '' for poetry of a strange kind is seldom absent from his work .

		In view of the little that has been said in English about
Huysmans	PERSON	, one of the most valuable essays is that entitled '' The
Evo	PERSON	- lution of an Egoist '' ; it is worth while to have traced for us so clearly the curious evolution of a man who begins as a decadent making a cult of the monstrous and the abhorrent , and ends a mystic monk .

		To my mind there is nothing more penetrative in the book than the estimate of
Walter Pater	PERSON	-LRB- in a chapter called '' From an Ivory Tower '' -RRB- , where that writer is described as '' an egoist of the higher type ; he seldom left his tour -LRB- T ivoire ; yet his work is human and concrete to the core . ''

		One forgives the author much , because of such critical flashes as that .

Edward Channing	PERSON	's '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' which now , after three years ' delay , has at length been given to the expectant historical reader , reveals anew the deep scholarship and rare charm of style which commanded for the first instal - ment universal approval .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, what went before , is covered that important century which lay between the Restoration of the Stuarts and the Peace of
Paris	LOCATION	of
1763	DATE	, a century of empire-building fateful in the annals both of
England	LOCATION	and of
America	LOCATION	.

		In structure , the book consists of three parts : first , the nar - rative of the development of the Colonies gen - erally to about
1700	DATE	, and of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	to the middle of the century ; second , the description of various phases of Colonial civilization ; and third , the story of the rivalry of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		If any unfavorable criticism be deserved , it is to be grounded upon the absence of a com - plete and unified survey of Colonial and Imperial politics in the first half of the eighteenth cen - tury .

		Throughout the revolution of
1688	DATE	the treatment is systematic and admirably propor - tioned ; but the epoch of
Walpole	LOCATION	's control of English affairs , it must be confessed , seems not so skilfully handled or so thoroughly analyzed .

		Perhaps this difference is in a way but the reflec - tion of the circumstance that the earlier period has been as rich in monographic literature as the latter period has been neglected .

		At the outset .

		Professor
Channing	PERSON	recalls , as is his wont , the close relations that constantly existed between English and Colonial history .

		He begins with the picture of that group of '' colonizing courtiers '' who encircled
Charles II.	PERSON	, and who found in the plantation of Colonies , as in the African trade or the exploitation of
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, a possible source of replenishment for their shattered fortunes .

		Professor Chan - ning then rapidly sketches the English commer - cial system , in which the government adopted the policy of those Puritans whose work the leaders of English politics under the later
Stuart	PERSON	monarchy tried in so many other respects to destroy .

		There is due account of the various councils and committees which in this period looked out for Colonial affairs , though perhaps somewhat scant notice is given of the influence of the merchants , such as
Povey	PERSON	and
Noell	PERSON	, upon national policy .

		The author then takes up the narrative of the settlement of the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, the conquest of the
Middle Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and the affairs of
New England	LOCATION	through
King Philip	LOCATION	's War .

		After this he takes up the South , especially
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
Bacon 's Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Next follows an account of
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
William Penn	PERSON	, the Quakers , and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The narrative then turns back to the Northern-central Col - onies , and explains their relation to the French and the characteristics of the Stuart government , thus leading up to a clear discussion of the Revolution and the reconstructed Colonial sys - tem , with its new machinery and its additional legislation .

		In this first half of the book the tone has been prevailingly that of narrative , though many interesting comments are interwoven , like those on the sober trade of the Colonial merchants and the more romantic ventures of Colonial pirates .

		But after selecting the Colonies of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	for the special emphasis of their later development , the second part of the book becomes topical in treatment , and we read chapters which are really brilliant little essays upon the labor system , immigration , religious toleration , education , industry , and commerce of the Colonies .

		Finally , as we have already suggested , the last chapters are con - cerned with the development of
New France	LOCATION	and
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and the subordination of these , in their most important parts , to
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Sometimes , though very infrequently , Pro- fessor Channing seems to give a rather strained interpretation to a document .

		An example is found in the chapter upon the colonization of
Carolina	LOCATION	, where the writer maintains -LRB- p. 15 -RRB- that in the second charter to the Lords Proprietory , '' the
King	PERSON	went farther and himself granted liberty of conscience in matters of religious con - cernment to all colonists of
Carolina	LOCATION	who should live peaceably . ''

		The wording of the charter , as Mr.
McCrady	PERSON	we think has shown , indicates that the King made no such direct grant , but merely re-stated in wider terms what the Pro- prietors might do , and promised that those to whom the Proprietors granted indulgences should not be molested .

		In his first volume .

		Professor Channing himself pointed out the important connection between the phraseology as to toleration in the
Rhode Island Charter	LOCATION	and that in the '' Instriunent of Government '' of the Cromwellian period ; a little examination reveals that this
Rhode Island Charter	LOCATION	and that given to the
Carolina	LOCATION	Proprietors in
1665	DATE	are in the clauses respecting religion almost identi - cal .

		One wishes that Professor Channing would throw more light upon the whole question of the relation of the Colonies to the religious policy of
Charles II	PERSON	.

		As in the former volume , we find here no illustrations beyond serviceable maps .

		The appearance of the book is excellent , though a few errors , usually in the case of dates , have escaped the proof-reader ; for example , on page 28 ,

1670	DATE	; page 77 ,

		For those who want a book of the old - anda ^ o 're fashioned seagoing flavor , a mirror of the manners of the sailors whom SmoUett and Marryat drew and Gay and

Charles N. Robinson	PERSON	,
R.N.	LOCATION	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Of the regular naval histories and treatises we have enough and perhaps to spare .

		But here is a book with a certain novelty of motif , material , and viewpoint to recommend it .

		Its
spring	DATE	and raison d'etre is frankly the profuse and curious illustrations .

		By describing these we can best characterize the work .

		The author is a notable connoisseur and col - lector of old prints and engravings dlusti'ative of sea manners and types and the social side of sailor life afloat and ashore .

		Collectively , they show the his - toric British mariner , as contemporary pictorial art , sentimental or humorous , jjatriotic or playful , mhrored him ; the hearty , breezy tribe of ''
Tom Bowlings	PERSON	, '' ''
Ben Buntlines	PERSON	, '' '' Sweet
Williams	PERSON	, '' etc. , of play , novel , and ballad .

		Some plates are roughly Hogarthian in their robust truth .

		Others are plaintively sentimental and tenderly quaint .

		More , perhaps , are of the rollicking order , showing with old - fashioned frankness the high jinks of
Jack	PERSON	ashore with his '' PoU '' and not altogether '' Lovely Nan . ''

		The '' sweet little cherub who sits up aloft '' has very evidently not thought it worth while to look out for the shore morals of '' poor
Jack	PERSON	. ''

		In fine , Com - mander
Robinson	PERSON	's gallery of reproductions -LRB- ninety - five in all , with a pretty frontispiece in tints -RRB- is novel , entertaining , graphic , and not without serious illus - trative value .

		The text suitably and interestingly supplements the pictures , and is the result of much painstaking research through a mass of old plays , diaries , pamphlets , novels , ballads , that would stagger a less enthusiastic worker .

		The book is prepared and written con amove , and carries a whiff of the brine for the initiated reader .

		From
Cicero	PERSON	and his '' De Amicitia , '' SXSS ! '

		t `` Dr.
King	PERSON	and his treatise on `` The Laws of Friendship , Human and Di - vine '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- there have been countless writers on this most beautiful -LRB- or shoxdd one rather say next to the most beautiftd ? -RRB-

		of relationships .

		It is one of the first articles in the creed of
Oberlin	ORGANIZATION	's president , Dr.
Henry Churchill King	PERSON	, that the prime purpose and highest end of life is the cultivation of friend - ship with God and man ; and this little book of his states the laws governing this friendship as they were formulated in the author 's lectures at
Haverford College	ORGANIZATION	, in the course known as the Haverford Li - brary Lectures .

		To Dr.
King	PERSON	`` the problem of friendship is the problem of life itself '' ; and the essentials of ti-ue friendship are , first , integrity and breadth and dejjth of personality ; second , deep com - munity of interests ; third , mutual self-manifestation and answering trust ; and , fourth , mutual self-giving .

		These fundamentals underlie all spu-itual intimacies , whether with God or man ; and the surest guides to the cultivation of these intimacies are the Beatitudes and the thirteenth chapter of
First Corinthians	ORGANIZATION	.

		The highest services , the `` two services of prime significance , '' that one friend can render another are thus described : '' One may be , first of all , the man he ought to be , and lay daily the unconscious impress of a high and noble character upon liis friend ; and he may share with his friend his own best vision , the vision of those ideals and motives and personalities by which he himself most of all lives . ''

		And , near the end , the author inclines to think the single , all-inclusive counsel necessary is this : '' Stay persistently in the presence of the best in the sphere in which you seek attainment .

		All the rest will take care of itself .

		Hear persistently the best in music .

		See persistently the best in art .

		Read persistently the best in literatm-e .

		Stay per - sistently in the presence of the best in character . ''

		Excellent advice , whether in a handbook to friend - ship or elsewhere .

		The author rightly emphasizes the importance of activities as compared with passiv - ities , as a means of growth .

		The book is inspiring and helpful .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a com - prehensive reference book of unusual merit , partic - ularly fitted to meet the needs of public libraries and students of naval history .

		Only a part of the entire work is published in the two volumes that have been recently issued .

		They , however , are com - plete in themselves and do not suffer by being detached from the succeeding volumes , which wUl require several years more for their preparation .

		The complete work is divided by the author into five parts , which are as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB-
Administration of Department	ORGANIZATION	, and events and dates of reference in
United States	LOCATION	Naval History ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Engagments , expeditions , and captures of vessels of war ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- Captures of merchantmen ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- A complete record of every vessel 's service and fate ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- Amer - ican Privateers , 1772-1862 ; the
State Navies	ORGANIZATION	, 1775-1783 ; and the
Confederate States Navy	ORGANIZATION	, 1861-1865 .

		Volume I. is preliminary to the remain - ing volumes , and consists of a remarkably exhaus - tive bibliogi-aphy of the history of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It includes both manuscript and printed , both official and unofficial sources -- in all
9284	DATE	entries .

		In Volume II. , which contains Parts I. , II. , and III. , of the work , is disclosed the author 's unique method of treating naval history .

		He finds that it is possible 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, to present many important naval facts by means of tables , showing at a glance the dates of engagements , the ships and commanders taking part in them , the rate , tonnage , and armament of ships , the time of action , the number of killed and wounded , and many other interesting items of information .

		Full refer - ences to authorities for every important naval event are given .

		While so mechanical a method of treat - ment has its defects , it does succeed in presenting all the fundamental facts .

		The author and publisher have united in producing exceptionally accurate and well-printed volumes .

		The indexes are full and form a useful feature of the work .

''

		But though the author is known the world over as a money-getter of unsurpassed ability , he says -- and his words should be taken for not less than they are worth -- `` I know of nothing more despicable and pathetic than a man who devotes all the waking hours of the day to making money for money 's sake .

Miss Tarbell	PERSON	's memorable volume of rather different tone and complexion .

		The
Mai-tin & Hoyt Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Atlanta	LOCATION	, have
X %	PERCENT	Zr begun the publication of a '' Library of Southern Literature , '' a work plan - ned to fill fifteen volumes , of which the first two are now at hand .

		The plan of the '' Warner Library '' is rather closely followed , and such a work could hardly have a better model .

		Each author repre - sented is given a signed critical and biographical essay , which precedes the selected examples of his woi ` k. Good writers have been secm-ed for these critical appraisements , and the list of their names , coupled with that of the editorial and advisory coun - cils , is of a natm ' e to inspire confidence in the enter - prise .

		Like all subsci'iption works , this one is made '' to sell , '' but it is fairly obvious that salability has not been the only end in view , and that ideals of intelligent writing and sound judgment have informed the entire plan .

		Such could hardly fail to be the case with an enterprise conducted by President
Alderman	PERSON	, the late
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	, and Professors
Charles W. Kent	PERSON	,
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	,
Morgan Callaway	PERSON	,
George A. Wauchope	PERSON	, and
Franklin L. RUey	PERSON	.

		These men stand for the best scholai ` ship of the South , and inspire confidence from the start .

		Someone has said that `` when the South 's literature becomes known , the history of American literatm-e will be re-written . ''

		We are not quite sure of this , but we doubt not that some rela - tive judgments will be revised , and the whole subject seen in truer perspective .

		The generous scale of this work saves it from too much scrappiness , and enables something like justice to be done to each author deemed worthy of inclusion .

		The two vol - umes now published exliibit foi ` ty authors , which enables us to make a fair estimate of the total nmn - ber .

		The last two volmnes will be devoted to frag - mentary matter , a biographical dictionary , and an index .

		Do you believe in witches ?

		If not , Mr.
Oliver Madox Hueffer	PERSON	assures you , in his '' Book of Witches '' -LRB-
John McBride Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , you belong to the world 's educated minority -- but do not on that account make the mis - take of supposing that the witch is extinct in the mind of man , like the dodo .

		You yourself believe in the
Friday	DATE	superstition , have been known to patronize a palmist , or refuse to sit down with thir - teen at table .

		Then do n't be sm-prised to read in youi ' newspaper that a woman was accused of witch - craft in the next county .

		A witch is almost as easy to credit as a flying machine , and she has contributed much to the contentment of credulous humanity , who could blame her for their misfortunes which now they must shoulder without the relief afforded by the old illusion .

		It is in such light vein that Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	approaches his subject -- in a spirit of appre - ciation rather than of scientific calculation .

		Having proven to his own satisfaction that a revival of witch - craft is not impossible , he goes back to the good old days of romance and magic , describes a ''
Sabbath	PERSON	- general , '' explains ingeniously how the witch origin - ated and how she differed from the other rulers of the half-way worlds , depicts her official insignia , and gives a detailed account of her philtres , charms , and potions .

		There are also gruesome tales of witchcraft persecutions in the various countries of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		THE DIAL 331 nance of witchcraft in the Orient , besides repeating some of the author 's not particularly significant experiences with reputed witches in
Tuscany	LOCATION	,
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and rural
England	LOCATION	.

		A possible - ^ substantial volume bearing the author of the interesting title '' Thomas PownaU , `` Junius '' letters .

		- ^ j ^ ^ Y ^ ^ F.R.S. , Governor of
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts Bay , Author of the Letters of Junius , '' by
Charles A. W. PownaU	PERSON	, comes to us from Messrs.
Henry Stevens	PERSON	, Son ,
& Stiles	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	.

		Governor PownaU can not be counted among the greater lumin - aries of eighteenth-century politics ; nevertheless , the historians of that age must feel gi'ateful for this first adequate biography of a man who exercised , both by his personality and writings , great influence upon the men who controUed events during the early years of
George III	ORGANIZATION	.

		Governor PownaU was born in
1722	DATE	, and foUowed his elder brother
John	PERSON	into the colonial department of government .

		The time of his gi-eatest influence was during the period of the French and Indian War , when he was agent at large for the
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	, and then Governor of
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts .

		From the very first he became a student of colonial government , and his studies ended in the writing of his famous `` Administration of the British Colonies , '' which passed through a number of editions .

		PownaU belonged to the party of
WiUiam Pitt	PERSON	, and when his leader ceased to hold office , PownaU also was dropped from the government .

		During his sub - sequent parliamentary career his sympathies were with the opposition .

		In this large volume , written by one of Governor
Pownall	PERSON	's descendants , we have the results of a careful study of aU avaUable material .

		It is unfortunate that the author shows little skiU in the art of narration , and allows himself to wander off into long disquisitions on colonial history and allied topics , which detract seriously from the value of his book .

		The argument to prove that Governor PownaU was the author of the '' Letters of Junius '' is ingenious , and would be conclusive if the style of
Pownall	PERSON	's acknowledged writings was not so far re - moved from that of `` Junius '' as almost to preclude the possibility of a common authorship .

		A new cure for the misgovernment of American cities is always a matter for rejoicing .

		Mr.
Horace E. Deming	PERSON	, in his preface to '' The Government of American Cities '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , informs us that he has found such a cure in the application of the true principles of democracy , -- the control of local affairs by the people of the localities , untrammeled by the nagging interference of state legislatures .

		The claim to nov - elty of viewpoint in approaching this vexed problem would meet with more ready acceptance had Pro- fessor
Goodnow	PERSON	not published his `` Municipal Home Rule '' in
1895	DATE	.

		And the further insistence which Mr.
Deming	PERSON	lays on the separation of political from administrative functions and the exercise of central control over local affairs through administrative rather than legislative organs after the model of the English system , sounds strangely familiar to one ac - A new-old cure for civic misgovernment .

		quainted with Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	's other writings on municipal affairs .

		In truth , the author , by the constant reiteration and elaboration of the famUiar and the obvious , has expanded a few sane and wholesome ideas into a volume of two hundred pages , infusing into the material more methodically set forth by Messrs.
Fairlie	PERSON	and
Goodnow	PERSON	a commendable zeal for civic improvement and an earnest appeal to good citizens to bestir themselves to accomplish the desired residt .

		An appendix of a hundred pages contains the
Municipal Programme	ORGANIZATION	of the
National Municipal League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book offends even more in repeating its own ideas than in borrowing those of others .

		But in spite of these most obvious defects , the desir - abUity of a wider acceptation of the principles set forth and elaborated bids us welcome Mr.
Deming	PERSON	's cooperation in the task of educating citizens for the more efficient administration of the public business .

		Anecdotes of Another book of jokes , strung together

Ralph NevUl	PERSON	and
Charles Edward Jerningham	PERSON	.

		`` Piccadilly to PaU MaU '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is its rather attractive title , and views of
St. James 's Palace	ORGANIZATION	and the Empire Theatre furnish appropriate pictorial embellishment .

		An early page contains the follow - ing explanation of a curious social usage that may have puzzled others besides ourselves .

		`` The cus - toms of Society , '' observes the writer , `` often have queer origins .

		Some years ago the members of a somewhat inferior set took to shaking hands on a level with their chins , a mode copied from a Royal personage , who , suffering from an abscess under the arm , avoided the painful friction entaUed by shaking hands in the ordinary manner and resorted to a higher level .

		This was observed by some lesser lights , from whom the custom spread . ''

		Encom-ag - ing , if true , is the assertion that the pronunciation of the humbler classes has improved of late , and that false aspirations are disappearing .

		As a whole , the contents of the book are varied and entertaining , though not of uniform refinement .

Jasper Douthit	PERSON	's Story '' -LRB-
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is `` the autobiography of a pioneer , '' a pioneer frail in body but mighty in soul ; and the modest account of his self-sacrificing labors in various good causes -- anti-slavery , temperance , liberal religion , and a higher tone of morality generally -- makes a book that wiU not soon be allowed to die .

		Like the martyred
Lovejoy	PERSON	, Mr.
Douthit	PERSON	had to encounter the fiercest opposition and the bitterest hatred in his anti-slavery work , and his life was in constant 332 THE DIAL -LSB-

		What he has accomplished for temperance and for enlightened religion in a district forbid - dingly opposed to such reforms is seen , even in his short and unpretentious narrative , to be something approaching the marvellous .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A handbook of Alphabets , under the title of '' Gram - mar of Lettering '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , proves upon examin - ation to be a Grammar indeed , attention being given almost exclusively to the practical construction of let - ters .

		It is thus a book for the sign-writer and student in Trade Schools , rather than for the art student and architect , who should be interested in the history and philology of the alphabet and of literal forms .

		Of the alphabets reproduced those founded upon the roman let - ters are most specifically treated .

		Of the gothic letters there is Uttle variety , and scarcely any originality exhib - ited .

		The book is by
Andrew W. Lyons	PERSON	, of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		An interesting side-light is thrown on Civil War times by the little book entitled ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and the
London	LOCATION	Punch '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , prepared by Mr.
William S. Walsh	PERSON	.

		Fifty-four cartoons are reproduced with many verses and editorial comments , running from
January , 1861	DATE	, to the famous retraction and apology that followed the assassination .

		The changes in the public opinion to which '' Punch '' catered are accurately reflected .

		First we see sympathy with the North , a Lincoln of manly features appearing in the cartoons ; then following Bull Run and the blockade pubhc opinion changed in favor of the South , and the pencil of
Tenniel	PERSON	depicted the President as a repulsive and grotesque monster .

		It is now some sixteen years since the death of Dr.
Richard Spruce	PERSON	, a botanist and botanical explorer of the first rank .

		Always in poor health and unequal to any sort of clerical work .

		Dr.
Spruce	PERSON	left a mass of notes and manuscript , fragmentary and almost cryptic save to himself , which he had vainly hoped to convert into a journal , to be called '' Notes of a Botanist on the
Amazon	LOCATION	and Andes . ''

		Now his friend , Mr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, believing in the scientific value and literary interest of the journals , comes forward to edit them ; and he has produced a two-volume work , which the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	publish with illustrations , many of them from Dr.
Spruce	PERSON	's own drawings , and maps of the regions visited .

		The first quarter of the work Dr.
Spruce	PERSON	had nearly ready for publication ; the rest com - prises journals , letters , printed or manuscript articles , and scattered notes .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	utiUzed only about one-third of the material in his hands , feeling that a longer work would lack general interest and be no more valuable to botanical readers .

		To the latter , but possi - bly not to the casual reader , it will be clear that Dr.
Spruce	PERSON	's South American wanderings are of much interest to scientists in connection with his great work on the ''
Hepaticse	PERSON	of the

Henry Frowde	PERSON	has published , under the editorial supervision of Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, a reprint of a forgotten , or nine-tenths forgotten , novel of the early nineteenth century , entitled '' The Heroine , '' by

Elliot Stock	PERSON	sends as an '' Index to Book Prices Current '' for the decade 1897-1906 , being the second decennial issue of this valuable publication .

		It makes a volume of over one hundred thousand entries , filling a thousand two-columned pages .

		Besides enabling its possessor to follow the ebb and flow of the prices of particular books , the work also supplies him with many special bibliographies , and with indexes of pseudonyms , editors , translators , and artists .

		For prices , of course , one must refer to the annual volumes whose contents are here summarized .

		Mr.
A. Jaggard	PERSON	is the compiler .

		By the publication of the new edition of his '' Read - ings on the Paradiso of Dante '' the Hon.
William Warren Vernon	PERSON	completes the task of presenting his serviceable commentary -LRB- based chiefly upon Benvenuto da Imola -RRB- to the public in a thoroughly revised form , and at a materially lowered price .

		Students of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	owe a deep debt of gratitude to this editor for the work to which he has given the labors of so many years , and the six volumes of his '' Readings '' -LRB- including the two now at hand -RRB- constitute what is perhaps the most useful of all
Dante	ORGANIZATION	manuals to be had in the English language .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Art students will welcome the advent of a new edition of
Crowe	PERSON	and
Cavalcaselle	ORGANIZATION	's '' New History of Painting in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' imported by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		For years this standard work has been out of print , and second-hand copies have been scarce and very costly ; whereas no book written in the meantime has approached this one in value , for completeness , detail , and scientific criticism .

		The new edition is in three moderately priced volumes , amply illustrated in far more satisfactory fashion than was mechanically pos - sible forty-four years ago .

		The editor is Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	, whose notes , enclosed in brackets , voice such newly discovered facts or modern theories as seriously confute or worthily supplement the text , which is kept absolutely intact .

		On
January 13	DATE	of the present year , the anniversary of the death of Edmimd
Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, a memorial meeting was held by the friends of the poet at the
Carnegie Lyceum	LOCATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The proceedings of that meeting are now published in pamphlet form at the De
Vinne Press	PERSON	, and constitute a tender and touching tribute to a man whose generous kindliness endeared him to his fellows as few men have ever been endeared , and whose fortitude of soul , amid perplexities and adver - sities , made his character a shining example of manhood 334 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Addresses were made by Mr.
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	,
Colonel W. C. Church	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
R. U. Johnson	PERSON	.

		Letters were presented , in - cluding a peculiarly moving communication from Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, poems were read , and songs were smig , all expressive of the deepest love and gratitude -- love for
Stedman	PERSON	the man , and gratitude for his eminent services as a representative of American letters .

		The
Department of English of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, acting on the suggestion of many friends of the late Professor
Carpenter	PERSON	, has decided to found a memorial library to be named the
George Rice Carpenter Memo	ORGANIZATION	- rial Library .

		In view of Professor
Carpenter	PERSON	's long association with the
University	ORGANIZATION	and of the high quality and widely diffused influence of his work , some memo - rial is deemed appropriate , and because of the nature of his work and character , so practical a form as a library is especially fitting .

		Professor Carpenter had , indeed , frequently suggested the desirability of a de - partmental library and special reading room for the use of graduate and undergraduate students in English , Comparative Literature , and allied subjects , and had gone so far as to gather together a few books of refer - ence in the rooms of the department .

		A nucleus for such a library has , therefore , already been formed , which will in time become a substantial and useful memorial .

		It is expected that the
University	ORGANIZATION	will pro- vide a special room to serve as the permanent home of the library , which should include works of reference and files of journals of importance to students , and a large collection of standard works in English literature and allied subjects .

		A committee has been formed to take temporary charge of the memorial .

		Subscriptions and gifts of books may be addressed to Professor
Ashley H. Thorndike	PERSON	,
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Tauchnitz '' Collection of British Authors , '' the publication of which began in
1841	DATE	, now numbers four thousand volumes .

		The word '' British '' in the title has always been a misnomer , for American authors have figured in the collection from its earliest years , begin - ning with
Cooper	PERSON	,
Irving	PERSON	, and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and coming down to such contemporaries as Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		No less than sixty American names are included in the Tauchnitz list , and the number of volumes runs into the hundreds .

		It has been the custom of the publishers to signahze the completion of every even thousand volumes added to the collection by what is designated as a '' memorial volume , '' and in the case of the fourth thou - sand , '' A Manual of American Literature , '' prepared by Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	, in collaboration with several members of the faculty of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, has been published .

		This volume may be had , of course , in the regular Tauchnitz form , but it is also published for American readers by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	in a special edition .

		The chapters upon our Colonial and
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary literature have been abridged by Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	from the histories of the late
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	; the remaining chapters are written by Messrs.
Isaac M. Bentley	PERSON	,
Clark S. Northup	PERSON	,
Lane Cooper	PERSON	, and
Elmer J. Bailey	PERSON	.

		Our nineteenth-century literature is classified under the seven heads of historians , novelists , poets , essayists and humorists , orators and divines , scientists , and periodicals .

		Each of these groups has a chapter of its own , giving an historical survey , and brief biographical and critical accounts of individual authors .

		BRIEFER MENTION 374 NOTES .375 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 376 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 376 GEORGE MEREDITH .

		It was only about a month ago that we were reading
Meredith	PERSON	's exquisite tribute to Swin - burne ; but what writer is now left alive to pay adequate tribute to
Meredith	PERSON	, who survived his fellow-singer and life-long friend by a scant six weeks ?

		It is a heavy loss to English literature that this
Spring	DATE	records ; our two greatest have left us , and we have only what consolation may be found in the possession of their rich inherit - ance , and in the thought that both had lived long enough amply to fulfil the purpose of their being .

		The younger singer was one of the first to pro- claim the achievement of his elder brother , call - ing him nearly half a century ago '' one of the three pr four poets now alive whose work , per - fect or imperfect , is always as noble in design as it is often faultless in result , '' and the elder outlived the younger just long enough to say of him the most fitting words of praise that any - one was heard to speak at the time of his death .

		Thus are the two greatest writers left to the twentieth century from the Victorian age insep - arably linked in our memory , as they were linked one with another during life by the spir - itual bond of a common outlook upon the world and a common consecration to the art of noble expression .

		Despite the praises of those who knew , be - stowed upon him in his early manhood ,
Meredith	PERSON	had to wait long for anything like wide recog - nition of his extraordinary genius .

		His story has been the old one of the writer who , disdain - ing the arts of popularity , makes his appeal to a few choice spirits in each lustrum or decade , whose accumulating testimony at last breaks down the wall of public indifference , and forces at least a formal admission of his title to an exalted place in the poetic hierarchy .

		Meredith 's public acceptance is hardly more than formal even now , and he is perhaps destined to occupy some such place as Landor occupies in our liter - ature , unknown to the populace save by name , but loved and cherished by the minority whose suffrage really counts and whose judgment in the long run absolutely determines all questions of literary rank .

		It is , on the whole , a not unenviable fate ; the gusts of popularity are apt soon to spend their force , but the trade-winds of 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, reasoned critical judgment are neither capricious nor intermittent .

		Writing some score of years ago , Professor
Dowden	PERSON	said : '' To many persons , not long since , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's novels seemed to be the
Woods of Westermain	LOCATION	, dark , obscure , and un - frequented .

		Like Poliphilus , in the Renaissance allegory , they have now emerged out of the dark wood , and are about to refresh themselves from its waters . ''

		There is no doubt that a few thousands of cultivated readers have discovered the novels since these words were penned , and have esteemed themselves fortunate in so doing .

		But the number of those who are ca - pable of finding in ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	'' and `` The Egoist '' and `` Vittoria '' the highest artistic satisfaction is by nature limited , and is never likely to equal the number of those who keep
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	popular from generation to generation .

		We are not sure that this is not poetic justice ; for
Meredith	PERSON	's novels are undoubtedly chargeable with per - versity of manner , and , although not fairly with obscurity of thought , certainly with a deliberate refusal to moderate their gait to the pace of the slow-footed reader , or to temper their dry and dazzling light by an admixture of sentiment and logical exposition .

		It is not an altogether un - worthy proceeding to make some concessions even to didness of wit ; and clearness is a virtue that the greatest of artists has no right to scorn .

		Those who resort to
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	's novels with the expectation of swift dramatic action and a plot in the cheaper sense of the term are doomed to disappointment .

		Plot there is , but of the sort that proceeds rather from character than from circumstance .

		A frequently quoted passage expresses the author 's views upon this subject . ''

		In tragic life , God wot , No villain need be !

		passion spins the plot .

		We are betrayed by what is false within . ''

		But if we miss the hurrying excitement and the adventurous pattern of the conventional work of fiction , we have compensations rich enough to make up many times for the defect .

		We have , first of all , a subtlety of characterization , a pen - etrative insight into the recesses of the individ - ual soul , that few other novelists have equalled , and perhaps none surpassed .

		The presentation of character , not by description but by self - revelation , was always
Meredith	PERSON	's fiuidamental aim , and he achieved it to an almost Shake - spearian degree .

		And besides this display of sheer creative power , he unfolds for his readers a social philosophy that takes for its province wellnigh all the moods and relations of mankind , a criticism of life that is sometimes mordant , but always broadly tolerant and humane .

		The mo - tion of his spirit is often too agile to be easUy followed , but its most capricious dartings and swoopings are reducible to law , and remain in harmonic conformity with a reasoned theory of conduct .

		No writer of any time has seen the world with a clearer vision than
Meredith	PERSON	, or looked life more honestly in the face .

		He kept the open mind through all his days , and welcomed every fresh adventure of science , fearlessly moving forward into the new territory wrested from the kingdom of old night .

		So fundamental was his conviction that life is good , that he never shrank from the fresh revelations that are always com - ing with the advancement of knowledge .

		His was no timorous soul to huddle among the shadows lest the light prove too blinding , or to cling to tradition despite all evidence that its foundations were rotting , and its superstructure doomed to be swept away .

		Not for liim the palterings of his fellow - poets --
Browning	PERSON	's stub - born refusal to listen to any promptings save those of the heart ,
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's passionate deter - mination to '' cling to faith beyond the forms of faith , ''
Arnold	PERSON	's half-hearted acceptance of the inevitable passing of the old order .

		And the world upon which he thus looked with a gaze unclouded by vain regrets -- the realized world of the present and the imagined world of the future that science is slowly shaping for our intel - lectual acceptance -- seemed to him a good world , wonderful in plan , and rich in possibilities for the emancipated human spirit . ''

		He builds the soaring spires , That sing his soul in stone : of her he draws , Though blind to her , by spelling at her laws , Her purest fires . ''

		Meredith is so great a novelist because he is essentially a poet , and the discussion of his fic - tion must always lead to the consideration of his verse .

		The philosophy of life and conduct which is implicit in his romantic inventions becomes explicit and crystallized in his song .

		His poetry is no less difficult of mastery than his prose , but is even better worth the needed effort , and who - ever applies himself earnestly to the task is sure of his reward .

		The initial difficulties of the reader of Meredith 's verse are considerable , and it may be frankly admitted that many of the poems are so crabbed in diction and so laby - rinthine in thought that they are hardly worth while .

		But even the most unpromising matrix
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 may conceal nuggets of the purest gold , and we would not flatly discourage investigation even of such productions as '' Junip-to-Glory Jane '' and the '' Odes in Contribution to the Song of French History . ''

		On the other hand , we would not recommend these eccentricities to the beginner .

		But '' Modern Love '' and '' A Reading of Earth '' and the '' Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth '' may be named in full confidence that the reader , if he knows what poetry is , will soon learn to revel in their beauty , and be prepared to undertake more adventurous excursions later on .

		Best of all to start with is the volume of '' Selected Poems , '' taking Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's little book on '' The Poetry and Philosophy of
George Meredith	PERSON	'' as a companion and guide .

		The beauty of his expression , at its not infre - quent best , wovdd alone be sufficient to secure for Meredith a high place in English poetry .

		The security becomes far greater when we take into account the sanity of his thought and its exalted ethical message .

		`` Ay , be we faithful to ourselves : despise Nought but the coward in .

		us !

		that way lies The wisdom making passage through our slough .

		Am 1 not heard , my head to
Earth	LOCATION	shall bow ; Like her , shall wait to see , and seeing wait .

		Philosophy is Life 's one match for Fate . ''

		Life is an unending struggle , but not for that a dispiriting one . ''

		Never battle 's close The victory complete and victor crowned ; Nor solace in defeat , save from that sense Of strength well spent , which is the strength renewed .

		In manhood must he find his competence ; In his clear mind the spiritual food ; God being there whUe he his fight maintains ; Throughout his mind the Master Mind being there , While he rejects the suicide despair .

		Accepts the spur of explicable pains . ''

		Man may make his life or mar it as he will , and the responsibility is all his own . ''

		For of waves Our life is , and our deeds are pregnant graves Blown rolling from the sunset to the dawn . ''

		He should be '' Obedient to Nature , not her slave : Her lord , if to her rigid laws he bows .

		Her dust , if with his conscience he plays knave .

		And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse . ''

		The world will not soon forget a poet who can speak to it in such appealing accents , inspire it to such noble purpose .

		The mortal part of him has gone from the sight of man , but the immortal part remains their heritage . ''

		Full lasting is the song , though he , The singer , passes : lasting too .

		For souls not lent in usury , The rapture of the forward view . ''

		THE MUSE IN THE MOUNTAINS .

		The story is told of the blessed St.
Bernard	PERSON	, that as he was journeying one day along the shores of
Lake Geneva	LOCATION	a fellow-traveller asked him what he thought of the lake .

		`` What lake ? ''

		was the holy man 's rejoinder , so little had he taken note of the magnificent scenery that encircled him .

		Of men with
St. Bernard	ORGANIZATION	's introverted gaze it is not primarily the present purpose to write , nor of those who , on surveying a panorama of snow - capped or sparsely-wooded peaks , can only say with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	: '' An eye accustomed to flowery pas - tures and waving harvests is astonished and repelled by this wide extent of hopeless sterility .

		The ap - pearance is that of matter incapable of form or usefulness , dismissed by Nature from her care , and disinherited of her favors ; left in its original elemental state , or quickened only with one sullen power of useless vegetation . ''

		To inveterate city - lovers , '' it will very readily occur that this uniformity of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the traveller ; that it is easy to sit at home and conceive rocks and heath and waterfalls ; and that these jour - neys are useless labours , which neither impregnate the imagination nor enlarge the understanding , '' Who of us others , who are neither
St. Bernards	ORGANIZATION	nor Dr.
Johnsons	PERSON	, can fail to recall the thrill of wonder and delight with which our youthful eyes first encountered a wild and extended mountain landscape ?

		Then first awoke in us , together with an incipient sense of the immeasurable vastness and unutterable grandeur of the universe , perhaps also a vague impulse to give some expression to our feeling of the bigness of things in general and of the majesty of the mountains in particular .

		Or it may have been that the wide-eyed child , repeating the history of early man , experienced at first too much of awe , even of terror , to be in a fit condition to sing the praises of the breath-arresting sublimities confronting him .

		With him perliaps , as with
Childe Harold	PERSON	, of whom he has yet no knowledge , `` high mountains are a feeling , '' and they may not speedily become anything less mutely emotional .

		It has taken the human race a long while to overcome this first nameless terror .

		of the vastness and wildness of the mountains .

		Ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	have no Wordsworths or Bryants to celebrate in verse the beauties of the Thessalian mountain ranges or of the Alpine peaks .

		Mountains , in fact , enjoy no enviable reputation with them .

		In his `` Ars Amatoria ''
Ovid	LOCATION	shudders at the very mention of the '' windy Alps . ''

		Virgil couples the adjective improhus with monSy as if the latter were something hardly to be named in polite society .

		Horace speaks of the `` wintry , ''
Lucan	PERSON	of the `` icy , '' and Juvenal of the '' cruel '' Alps .

		Centuries later , a German tourist ,
Winckelmann	PERSON	, though charmed and delighted with the Swiss scenery , was moved to call its moun - tains '' frightfully '' beautiful -LRB- erschrecklich schon -RRB- .

		Goethe 's father could not understand why his son 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, turned back at the summit of the
St. Gothard	ORGANIZATION	, instead of pushing on at once into the sunny plains of
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		He was especially unable , '' records the poet , `` to evince the smallest feeling of apprecia - tion for those rocks and misty lakes and nests of dragons . ''

		To instance another example of an impressionable nature strangely untouched by mountain scenery , or by rural sights of any kind , we find Charles Lamb writing to
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	in almost angry protest against the imputation of nature-worship .

		His friend had thus apostrophized him in verse : '' My gentle-hearted
Charles !	PERSON

		for thou hast pined And hungered after Nature many a year , In the great city pent . ''

		And the other bluntly replies : `` I have no passion -LRB- or have had none since I was in love , and then it was the spurious engenderment of poetry and books -RRB- for groves and valleys .

		The room where I was born , the furniture which has been before my eyes all my life , a book-case which has followed me about like a faithful dog -LRB- only exceeding him in knowl - edge -RRB- wherever I have moved , old chairs , old tables , streets , squares , where I have sunned myself , my old school , -- these are my mistresses .

		Have I not enough without your mountains ?

		I do not envy you .

		I should pity you did I not know that the mind will make friends of anything . ''

		Lamb did go so far as to admit , in a letter to
Manning	PERSON	after a trip to the lakes , that ''
Skiddaw	PERSON	is a fine creature , '' although for him a chance of seeing Fleet Street every now and then was necessary , or he should '' mope and pine away . ''

		But Lamb was not a great poet ; indeed , so much better do we like him as an essayist and a letter - writer that we are more than half-willing to see him excluded from the company of poets altogether .

		He visited the lake district in premeditated quest of '' that which tourists call romantic '' and he seems to have found it ; but it thrilled him to no lyric effusion -- just a mildly appreciative letter to
Manning	PERSON	.

		We must go to his friend Wordworth to find a real love of the mountains .

		In his sonnet on Mount Skiddaw he laments that '' not an English Mountain we behold by the celestial Muses glorified . '' ''

		Yet round our sea-girt shore they rise in crowds : What was the great Parnassus ' self to Thee , Mount Skiddaw ?

		In his natural sovereignty Our British Hill is nobler far ; he shrouds His double front among
Atlantic	LOCATION	clouds , And pours forth streams more sweet than Castaly . ''

		The opening lines of another sonnet well depict the shining appearance of a distant snow-capped peak . ''

		How clear , how keen , how marvellously bright The effluence from yon distant mountain 's head .

		Which , strewn with snow smooth as the sky can shed .

		Shines like another sun -- on mortal sight
Uprisen	PERSON	, as if to check approaching
Night	TIME	, And all her twinkling stars . ''

		Turning our steps northward from
Wordsworth	PERSON	's and
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's haunts , we find that the rugged landscape of
Scotland	LOCATION	has inspired many a noble line of poetry .

		In Sir
Walter	PERSON	's verse , of course .

		there is no lack of '' mountains that like giants stand , to sentinel enchanted land . ''

		From the '' steep promontory '' of '' The Lady of the Lake , '' count - less readers have gazed with '' the stranger , raptured and amazed . ''

		Even before
Scott	PERSON	, two of his coun - trymen ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	and
Beattie	PERSON	, were alive to the charms of mountain and valley ; nor must Bums be passed over in silence , nor
John Logan	LOCATION	and
Michael Bruce	PERSON	altogether forgotten .

		To be sure , much of this earlier nature-poetry -LRB- as one may call it for lack of a better term -RRB- is stiff and formal and aca - demic .

		Yet
Beattie	PERSON	's account of the youth who found his way to poetry through lonely forest paths and mountain rambles is not without grace . ''

		Concourse and noise and toil he ever fled , Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray Of squabbling imps ; but to the forest sped .

		Or roamed at large the lonely mountain 's head , Or where the maze of some bewildered stream To deep , untrodden groves his footsteps led . ''

		To
Rousseau	PERSON	is commonly given the credit of having turned us moderns from conventionality and artificiality back to the simple and the natural , to the enjoyment of country life and the appreciation of wild beauty in forest and mountain .

		The benign influence of mountains on the human mind , he has pictured at some length in language plentifully sprinkled with flowers of rhetoric .

		At high eleva - tions '' the thoughts take on something indescribably grand and sublime , in harmony with the environment , a tranquil voluptuousness that is utterly free from coarseness or sensuality .

		One seems , on rising above the abodes of man , to leave behind all low and earthly sentiments ; and the nearer the approach to the ethereal regions , the more of their celestial purity does the soul appropriate to itself .

		There one is grave without melancholy , calm without indolence . ''

		He describes his own sensations with considerable unc - tion , and expresses surprise that mountain air has not hitherto been recognized as a potent medicine for body and soul .

		In the `` Nouvelle H ^ loise , ''
Rousseau	PERSON	, speaking through the mouth of Saint - Preux , who is returning from a journey round the world , vents the most enthusiastic praise of Alpine scenery . ''

		The sight of my country , '' he exclaims , '' that so-beloved country , where torrents of pleasure had inundated my heart , the wholesome , pure atmos - phere of the Alps , the soft air of home , sweeter than the perfumes of the
East	LOCATION	, this rich and fertile soil , this unrivalled landscape , the most beautiful that human eye has ever seen , ... all these things threw me into transports that I can not describe . ''

		The city-dweller , harassed and weary after his winter 's work and confinement , should find rest and refreshment at this season in
Longfellow	LOCATION	's lines : '' If thou art worn and hard beset With sorrows that thou wouldst forget .

		If thou wouldst read a lesson that will keep Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep , Go to the woods and hills !

		No tears Dim the sweet look that Nature wears . ''

		Equally good , and also seasonable , are
Bryant	PERSON	's verses beginning :
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 357 '' Thou who wouldst see the lovely and the wild Mingled in harmony on
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's face ,
Ascend	ORGANIZATION	our rocky mountains . ''

		Not all of U8 at all times , and perhaps compara - tively few of us at any time , can feel , with Words - worth , a presence that disturbs us with the joy of elevated thoughts , a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused ; but it is likely to be on Skiddaw , or
Monadnock	ORGANIZATION	, or
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, or
Shasta	ORGANIZATION	, or some other commanding mountain-top , if any - where , that this reaction from the prosaic humdrum of our routine existence makes itself felt ; and even a short half-hour of such experience seems at the time cheaply bought by a year of dull toil in the cities of the plains .

		Swinburne somewhere speaks of these glorious altitudes as '' The warm wan heights of air , moon-trodden ways , And breathless gates and extreme hills of heaven . ''

		That the mountains should be inspirers , not only of poetry , but also of music , seems to find a ready explanation .

		The multiple echo of a mountainous region is almost music in itself .

		What , then , more natural than for the Swiss peasant to yodel from every hill-top and make the welkin ring ?

		or for the Scotch highlander to tune up his bagpipes and invite the mountains to join in the refrain ?

		A curious inquirer might find something in the very shape of the mountains -- the converging and upward-pointing lines , like those of the Gothic arch , the cathedral aisle -- to account for their awe-inspiring influence ; and in the impetuous dash and rollicking freedom of their babbling streams , so different from the slug - gish and silent flow of lowland brooks and rivers , might be discovered another source of musical and poetic inspiration .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Aspects of the copyright question vary enormously according to the point of view .

		Every man 's private interest shows an incorrigible tendency to effect , for that man , a total obscuration of the billion or more interests of the rest of the world ; and thus the arguments of champions of opposing interests frequently become as futile and absurd as the quarrel of the two knights-errant concerning the color of the shield suspended between them .

		A little illustration of disputation at somewhat cross purposes has recently been furnished to readers of The Dial .

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, writing from the publisher 's point of view , and Messrs.
Steiner	PERSON	and Cutter from the librarian 's , have fav - ored us with sundry excellent arguments for and against certain restrictions on the importation of a certain class of books .

		Possibly the latter gentle - men 's zeal in a worthy cause betrayed them into a too slight regard for the amenities of speech . ''

		This is simply an absolutely false statement '' is one of those things that might have been expressed differ - ently .

		Perhaps , too , in the ardor of the moment .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's meaning has here and there been a little distorted by his critics .

		For example , Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	, after speaking of the ''
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature , '' proceeds to make the gen - eral assertion that '' it is frequently the case that the American librarian purchases the English edition of a work at a considerably higher price than lie would pay for an American edition equally attractive in form '' -- a simple and indisputable fact , even though the degree of '' frequency '' of this occurrence may be open to dispute .

		Our librarian correspondents , however , have seized upon this innocent statement and made it apply to the '' English Literature '' alone , which , they go on to say , '' can be imported , for a library , for about two dollars , not as Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	says , for more than the American edition costs , ' equally attractive in form . ' ''

		Surely the librarians have a strong enough case without putting into an opponent 's mouth words that he never uttered .

		But , whatever the more immediate issue , our aeronauts assure us that the day is dawning when the barriers of tariffs and customs will have to fall , not being capable of erection to the heights attained by air-ships ; and then , to use a favorite phrase of the late Professor
Perry	PERSON	of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, `` the petty , piddling processes of protection '' will cease to vex the importer , whether of French modes or of English books .

		... The pbecipitatk removal of a librarian , of more than twenty years ' active service in his post and in honorable repute in his profession , is a matter that naturally calls out considerable comment and criticism .

		The abrupt dismissal of Mr.
Hild	PERSON	, of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is one of those occurrences hard to account for except infer entially through the mysterious machinations of professional politics .

		When Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, one of the most experienced and distinguished librarians in the country , left the Public Library for the
Newberry	LOCATION	, he was asked by the Directors to recommend a successor , and he named Mr.
Hild	PERSON	as in his opinion the best man for the place .

		Dr.
Poole	PERSON	was not likely to be mistaken about a man who had worked under his own eye for a dozen years , as Mr.
Hild	PERSON	had done ; and the favor - able prepossession created by this endorsement was confirmed by long years of faithful , and , until the present outbreak , approved service by Mr.
Hild	PERSON	as librarian .

		The charge of incompetency which it has taken twenty years to reach is , under the cir - cumstances , not altogether satisfying to the public whose interests the
Library Board	ORGANIZATION	, no less than the librarian , is supposed to serve .

		It can hardly be deemed uncharitable to suggest that the
Board	ORGANIZATION	itself may be at least partly responsible for the state of affairs which is made the ostensible ground of its drastic action .

		The lack of branch libraries and of travelling libraries , the insufficient coordination of the public library with the public schools , and the disproportionate expense of circulating the library 's books , are details in which the trustees are surely no less concerned than the librarian .

		Unceremonious 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, discharge of the latter official does not commend itself as the best way to supply such existing defects as have been pointed out .

		The proposed
Harper Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	for the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is likely to have features that will make it somewhat of a novelty in library architecture , at the same time that it will be a worthy memorial of the man whose best thought and energy went to the upbuilding of the institution of which he was the first head .

		The
May	DATE	number of '' The
University of Chicago Magazine	ORGANIZATION	'' opens with a good description , by Professor
Andrew C. McLaughlin	PERSON	, of the building that is yet to be -- that has , in fact , not yet been fully designed .

		Rati - fication of the architect 's plans is still to come , but some brief excerpts from the published description may safely be given .

		The new library '' is to form the centre of the row of buildings forming a con - nected line from
Ellis Avenue	LOCATION	to
Lexington Avenue	LOCATION	along the Midway ... The library building is 248 feet long from east to west along the Midway ; its width north and south is 60 feet .

		At either end is a tower 60 feet by 50 , rising above the main roof of the building , its highest turret 128 feet from the ground . ''

		The main part of the building will be comparatively low with no floors above the general reading-room in the third story .

		Book-stacks are in the basement , although they may be also introduced in rooms that at first will be used as offices and other - wise .

		The many-storied towers will have numerous rooms for various purposes , and the tower corridors will be accessible from adjacent buildings by means of bridges .

		The reading-room , 140 by 50 feet , with high vaulted ceiling , will seat 288 readers -- 38 more than the reading-room of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		So far as one can see , the needs of a great university library , the intellectual centre of the university life , have been wisely and generously provided for , except that more ample allowance might have been made for future accessions of books .

		In this item nine libraries out of ten fail to forsee the rapidity of their growth in even the near future .

		For example , the comparatively new library building of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	found itself cramped for book-room in a surprisingly short time after it had opened its doors .

		Westward the course of library activity TAKES its way , as is shown by the recent transfer of the official headquarters of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and by the movement , already well under way , for holding the annual conference of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	next year in
California	LOCATION	.

		At a recent meeting of the
California Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, at
Oakland	LOCATION	, a resolution was passed urging upon the Council of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	the desirability of holding next year 's national conven - tion at
Pasadena	LOCATION	, a place almost ideally situated for such a purpose -- especially if the time for the event could be fixed for
April	DATE	, a month when the charms of that fair land are at their loveliest .

		The plans already tentatively formulated include the use of the largest hotel in
Pasadena	LOCATION	, with an assembly room well fitted for the sessions of the convention , and with special rates and accommodations for the librarians .

		The inspiring beauties of the surround - ing regions , and the proximity of both the mountains and the sea , would afford opportunity for pleasurable excursions and entertainments , while the going and coming might be made delightful and profitable by including , under advantageous conditions and at economical rates , side trips to the
Grand Caflon	LOCATION	in going , and to
Yo Semite	ORGANIZATION	in returning by a northern route .

		The plan is certainly an attractive one , and is likely to receive favorable consideration from the librarians at their annual conference this month in the
White Mountains	LOCATION	.

		Mutual confidence among publishers has been promoted , in the
London	LOCATION	publishing world , by the formation of the
Publishers ' Circle	ORGANIZATION	, a sort of literary-commercial-dining -LRB- or lunching -RRB- club already mentioned by us .

		As a simple illustration of the benefits accruing to members of this organi - zation , let us quote a passage from Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	's reported utterances concerning the Circle , its mission , and its achievement . ''

		It was only the other day , '' said he , `` that a literary agent came to our firm -LSB- Messrs.
Chapman	PERSON	and
Hall	PERSON	-RSB- offering a book by an author , the sales of whose last work , he assured me , had amounted to 5000 copies .

		I told him I was confident that this was not the case .

		He replied by assuring me that it was .

		When the agent had left the room I rang up the publisher of the book in question , and he informed me that the entire sales had amounted to 572 copies ! ''

		One can not but wish the ringing-up had been done before , instead of after , the zealous agent had de - parted .

		Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	says further : '' Personally I feel that most of us are willing to pay an author whatever his book can fairly earn .

		... In the future it ought to be increasingly possible , through the exertions of the Circle , for an author to get just as much for his book as he is entitled to -- and no more . ''

		It is now three years since
the Circle	ORGANIZATION	had its informal beginning at the
Charterhouse Hotel	ORGANIZATION	, where half a dozen publishers were wont to lunch together .

		Its gradual growth , what it has done , and what it hopes to do , are all Ynatters of more than technical interest .

		The Shelleyisms of
Swinburne	PERSON	might furnish matter for an extended essay .

		By
Swinburne	PERSON	's Shelleyisms we shall here signify merely the more or less unconscious points of resemblance in the later poet 's life and character to the briefer career and more ardent temperament of the earlier .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, in some '' Impressions of Swin - burne '' contributed to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' touches briefly on a few of these parallelisms .

		Both poets were born aristocrats with a literary passion for democracy ; each went his own inde - pendent way at
Oxford	LOCATION	, though
Swinburne	PERSON	's way
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 was by far the quieter , and each left the Univer - sity without a degree ; both were lovers and skilful imitators of Greek poetry , especially of Greek tragedy .

		There are no traditions of Swinburne 's '' ragging the dons '' in
Shelley	LOCATION	's manner .

		On the contrary he conducted himself undemonstratively , choosing mainly the society of a Scottish student named
Nichol	PERSON	, who later became professor of English literature at
Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		There is a tradition that , when asked to subscribe to the cricket club , young
Swinburne	PERSON	proposed that he and
Nichol	PERSON	should pay one subscription between them ; and tradition also avers that persons passing the young poet 's rooms were more than likely to hear him reading poetry aloud and
Nichol	PERSON	knocking the ashes from his pipe .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is inclined to think it '' hardly conceivable that , as a poet and an Etonian in boyhood , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	should not have modelled himself , more or less consciously , on Shelley . ''

		• • • The bewildering array of monthly maga - zines that meets the eye on the railway news-stand must have often prompted the query .

		How do they all manage to keep going ?

		Probably the correct answer to this question is that comparatively few are really published at a profit .

		A great number are creatures of a day -- or a year , at most .

		They perish , but their places are immediately taken by fresh contestants in the struggle for existence , -- hope seeming to spring eternal in the breast of the would-be magazine publisher .

		Of the undistinguished many that thus float on the wave of a bi'ief pros - perity , or make-believe prosperity , little heed need be taken .

		But when a publication of some solidity and worth , like `` Appleton 's Magazine , '' vacates its wonted place on the news-stand , its retirement elicits a word of regret .

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	an - nounce the discontinuance of the above-named monthly with the
June	DATE	number , and also an arrange - ment with the publishers of ''
Hampton	PERSON	's Magazine '' by which that periodical will be supplied to
Appleton	LOCATION	subscribers during the unexpired terms of their sub - scriptions . ''

		Appleton 's '' deserved a better fate .

		The democratizing of culture , as one might call the aim and purpose of the proposed
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts College and also of the new system of uni - versity extension work undertaken by
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, is one of the most important movements in education that the world has seen , being comparable with the insti - tution of the public-school system itself .

		That aris - tocratic
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	should lend its support and its prestige to the new departure , whereby some of the benefits of a veritable university education are to be placed within the reach of the plebeian many , is a memorable and a pleasing occurrence in the history of culture ; and that the
State of Massachusetts	LOCATION	, which embraces within its borders some of the oldest and most conservative colleges -LRB- including the very oldest and most aristocratic -RRB- in the land , should also seek to broaden and popularize the scope of the higher education , is likewise noteworthy and com - mendable .

		As President
Hadley	PERSON	said recently in an address at
Mt. Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	, culture is a relative term , varying in meaning in different ages and among different communities ; but its essential ele - ment is the broadening of mental vision and the enlarging and perfecting of appreciation .

		Yet , after all is said and done , there will remain not a few , of an earlier generation , who cherish , rightly enough , the conception of culture as something best attained by pursuing the time-honored prescribed course at a college not yet wholly committed to '' electives . ''

		... The best cure for brain-fag is sought by more than one jaded literary worker at this season of the year .

		A little book by Dr.
Warren Achorn	PERSON	, entitled '' Nature 's Help to Happiness , '' presents some pleas - ant methods of recuperation .

		The doctor would turn all city dwellers out to grass -- bring them into close and continuous contact with the earth , espe - cially on mountain-tops and in forests .

		Out-door sleeping is recommended , and as much open-air work as would be required to keep a vegetable garden free from pig-weed , dandelions , quitch-gi-ass , and other unwelcome invaders of the potato-patch and the onion-bed .

		Dr.
Achorn	PERSON	has been a member of the medical staff of the
Emmanuel Church	ORGANIZATION	move - ment -LRB- otherwise known as Psychotherapy -RRB- , and he is a firm believer in the social efficacy of this '' ground cure . ''

		Strikes would be far less frequent , he believes , if every workman cultivated a garden and were more intent on punishing the weeds therein than on pestering his employer for shorter hours and higher wages .

		• • • The college man in the `` bread line '' is a spectacle that saddens and that moves to reflection .

		College education is more and more striving to coordinate itself with the demands of modern life and industry , the sciences are ousting the old-fashioned '' humanities , '' the principles of trade and commerce are taught , and to an increasing extent the practical is taking precedence of the ideal .

		And yet we are told by a mission worker in the slums of
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- we refer to Mr.
E. C. Mercer	PERSON	and his
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	address on '' College Graduates on the Bowery '' -RRB- that one night he counted thirty-nine college men of his acquaintance in the Bowery `` bread line , '' while another investigator found four hundred college men in the
Bowery	ORGANIZATION	in a single night .

		Under the old educational regime a college - bred pauper was an almost unheard of anomaly .

		Can it be that , after all , the most practical things are in some danger of proving the most useless ?

		Supervision of young folk 's reading and stimulation of interest in good literature can , as Mr.
Judson T. Jennnings	PERSON	of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	observes in his current Report , be advantageously accomplished by the public-school teacher in con - nection with the daily lessons .

		The delegation of an assistant librarian to do work of this sort in the 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	,
Saturday	DATE
morning	TIME	'' story hour '' has been objected to by some as not the most economical or effective means of attaining the desired end .

		With the cooperation of the teachers , library work in the schools is inexpensive , no special reading-rooms or staff of assistants being required ; and who , except perhaps a wise parent , could better understand the child 's individual needs and peculiar temperament than the child 's teacher ? ''

		If she is wise enough , '' says Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	, '' to realize the important part which intelligent reading has in education , both during and after school days , she wiU coordinate the pupil 's reading with his school work and thereby create an added interest in each . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In that dignified and forceful journal of public dis - cussion in
England	LOCATION	, the weekly '' Nation '' of
London	LOCATION	, I find -LRB- issue of May 10 -RRB- an eloquent editorial article on
Thomas Paine	PERSON	and his '' long life of conspicuous service in the causes of political and spiritual enlightenment in three great countries of which he was a citizen . ''

		The writer says : '' From his early life of sordid struggle , in what his biog - rapher justly calls ' an almost incredible
England	LOCATION	, ' he -LSB-
Paine	PERSON	-RSB- carried into the
New England	LOCATION	across the water a consuming passion for human justice and liberty , not as platform phrases , but as hard , concrete goods worth fighting and dying for , which set
America	LOCATION	afire , when she was confusedly ijondering ' an impossible and unnatural reconciliation . '

		From
America	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	, fresh in the throes of her great upheaval , he passed , not as an incendiary , but as a moderating and constructive influence in her
National Convention	ORGANIZATION	, risking his very life for the cause of clemency in dealing with a traitorous king .

		From
France	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	, carrying the same doctrines of liberty in politics and religion , not a cold utilitarian concep - tion of individual rights , but a rich human gospel of a com - monwealth sustained by a passion of humanity as deep and real as ever inflamed the soul of man .

		He was one of the first open advocates of the liberation of the negro slaves , of the abolition of capital ijunishment , of international treaties of ai-bitration : forty years before
Comte	PERSON	he was the author of the phrase ` the Religion of Humanity . '

		So far was he from being the atheist his malignant traducers fastened in the common mind , that his first and avowed motive in writing his ' Age of Reason ' was to induce man to ' return to the pure , unmixed , and unadulterated belief in one God and no other . '

		... The man whose eloquent and reasoned appeal , ' Common Sense , ' first formulated the demand for independence , the first coiner of the great thought and expression , ' The United States of
America	LOCATION	, ' the man whom
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	were proud to call their friend , and whose magnificent work for the liberation of their country they acknowledged with unstinted praise , -- this man was spoken of by
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	quite recently as ' a dirty little atheist . '

		But , after all , our feelings of resentment at such a brutality are assuaged by the reflection that whereas Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	will in a quick generation sink to the obscurity from wliich a series of acci - dents lifted him for a few years , history will gradually set in its proper place among the makers of the Republic the mem - oiy of the man whom he defamed . ''

		I have quoted this striking passage chiefly to ask whether it is really true that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	ever ap - plied to Paine the epithet given , and , if so , when , and under what circumstances .

		I have the impression that the term is not original with Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	; but that he even used it at all , in any way of endorsement , is something I do not like to believe .

		THE DIAJL 361 t Sttto looks .

		The WORLD 'S Family of Birds .

		* The awakening of interest in all fields of nature study , especially the study of birds , is illustrated by the issue of Dr.
Knowlton	PERSON	's hand - some volume on `` Birds of the World . ''

		There is no doubt that the book fills a real want .

		Thousands of bird-lovers have long felt the need of just such a work as this , which covers the avi - faunal field the world over and still is not too expensive or bulky .

		Heretofore the student of cosmopolitan bird-life has had to rummage every - where , with a large expenditure of time and money , in order to procure the information he desired relative to the life of birds in various parts of the world .

		While some might have preferred the work in two volumes , perhaps three , for convenience in handling and holding , yet it is to be assumed that there were good rea - sons for issuing it in one good-sized volume at a moderate price , rather than in several volumes at a greater cost .

		Large as the book is , it is well made , with a loose back so that it will lie open at any page , and therefore can be held on the lap or laid on the desk during perusal .

		The type is clear and large , and the paper of excel - lent quality .

		The contents of the work deserve unstinted praise .

		There is , in fact , little if anything to criticize .

		Even some of the more cheaply exe - cuted of the pictures are so truly illustrative as well to warrant their insertion .

		The literary quality of the work is good .

		It is not always that a scientific writer possesses a clear-cut lit - erary style .

		We know several valuable books on birds that suiifer much from the author 's inability to tell his story in an attractive way .

		Dr.
Knowlton	PERSON	, we are glad to say , describes his birds in such a simple and effective manner that the reader is pleased and interested at the same time that he is instructed .

		On the title-page , Mr.
Robert Ridgway	PERSON	is mentioned as the editor of the book .

		His preface informs us that he did little more than carefully to read and slightly revise the author 's manuscript .

		However , that was invaluable ser - vice , for it frees the text from typographical and scientific errors , and renders it as nearly correct as exact literary and scientific scholarship can make it .

		The author 's Introduction is of much • Birds of the World : A Popular Account .

		By
Frank H. Knowlton	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		With sixteen colored plates by
Mary Mason Mitchell	PERSON	, and 236 other illustrations .

		New York :
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		value ; it gives the latest definition of a bird , showing its place in the classified system of ani - mal life , and tells also of such matters as tem - perature , feathers , colors , pterylosis , renewal of feathers , age of feathers , nests and eggs , etc. .

		An excellent chapter , devoted to the anatomy of birds , is contributed by Dr.
Frederic A. Lucas	PERSON	, curator-in-chief of the
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then follow illuminating chapters by the author , on the geographical distribution of birds , their migration and classi - fication .

		On these subjects the author indicates what is actually known , while pointing out what still remains in the realm of speculation among scientific observers .

		It is extremely satisfactory thus to have presented the latest information obtainable in this field of nature-study .

		The matter in the main body of the work is arranged according to the best system of classi - fication yet devised , although the author gives full credit to other systems .

		Under each sub - class appear the various orders , sub-orders , families , super-families , and species , so that the systematic student is informed as to the exact scientific status of each member of the feathered family .

		It is indeed a joy to the student to have before him a book in which he can trace all the thousands of avian species in the world .

		True , the limitations of the work preclude the mention of all the species in some families -- as , for example , the Wood-warblers and Humming - birds ; but this does not prevent the student from finding the place of each species , whether named or not , in the avicular system .

		In the case of many families and species , enough is said about them to afford a satisfactory life history , the chief diagnostic habits being detailed .

		Wherever a species shows some very marked peculiarity , it is described with sufficient fulness .

		In brief , it may be said that the author has shown excellent and discriminating judgment in his selection of material , omitting nothing that was essential , and yet including whatever is of vital interest to the bird-lover .

		The work is , therefore , all that it purports to be -- a veritable handbook of the birds of the world .

		To give an example of the easy , flowing style of the author , and at the same time show that he has not written merely a dry table of statistical data , but has himself a warm appreciation of what is fascinating about our feathered neigh - bors , we quote the opening paragraph of his article on the Thrushes . ''

		The mere mention of the word
Thrush	PERSON	, at once sug - gests musical ability of a high order ; and well it may , for the present group numbers among its members some 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, of the most exquisite songsters of tlie whole wide world .

		The ringing , flute-like notes of the Yeery , the clear , pure come-to-me or e-o-lie of the
Wood Thrush	LOCATION	, the solemn , mysterious , silvery , bell-like tones of the
Hermit Thrush	ORGANIZATION	, as they come to us from the cool depths of the forest , and the cheerful , extended vocabulary of the
Robin	PERSON	, have placed them , one and all , high in the regard of lovers of bird music .

		The far-famed Nightingale of
Europe	LOCATION	, together with the Throstle , or Song
Thrush	PERSON	, and the Blackbird and
Robin Redbreast	PERSON	, so dear to English hearts , are all members of this widespread and highly musical family . ''

		While we are considering the Family Tin ^ - didce , it may he well to take it as an instance of the manner of the author 's treatment of an interesting group of birds .

		He is disposed to cut out of this family the Old World Warblers , the Mockingbirds -LRB- including the Thrashers and Catbirds -RRB- , the Dippers , and the Gnatcatchers .

		In spite of this extensive excision , Dr.
Knowlton	PERSON	informs us that the
Thrush	PERSON	family '' comprises between five and six hundred forms disposed among some seventy genera ; and if the
New Zealand	LOCATION	Thrushes -LRB- Turnagra -RRB- really belong here , which some doubt , it is practically cosmo - politan , though most abundant in the warmer parts of the Old World . ''

		He puts the lyrical Solitaires into this group , and that would be distinction enough even if the family contained not a single other feathered musician .

		There are half a dozen genera and thirty forms of the Solitaire sub-family , all of them native American birds except a single Hawaiian genus .

		We wonder what an Old World ornithologist would think if he were to be awakened some morning with the peerless song of
Townsend	ORGANIZATION	's Solitaire ringing in his ears .

		Besides the
Robin	PERSON	, the
Wood Thrush	PERSON	, the
Hermit Thrush	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , we find that there is a marvellous singing
Thrush	PERSON	in
South America	LOCATION	, some ground Thrushes in
Africa	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and one represent - ative -LRB- the Varied Thrush -RRB- in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The Fieldfare and Ring Ouzel of
Europe	LOCATION	belong to this varied fa.mily ; so do the Rock Thrushes , the Accentors , the
Bush Chats	PERSON	, the English
Robin	PERSON	, the
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, the Wheateavs , the Bluebirds , and quite a number of other forms .

		This will indicate the way in which Dr. Knowl - ton has packed his book with information , which an elaborate index makes easily accessible .

		The illustrations show the birds in the midst of their natural surroundings , and the subjects have been selected for their beauty and effec - tiveness .

		The sixteen full-page plates in colors , done by Miss
Mary Mason Mitchell	PERSON	, can hardly be praised too highly .

		The coloring is most delicate ; the poses are expressive , showing the birds at their best , as all bird pictures should ; and the setting for each bird is worked out with an accuracy and a loveliness of detail that any artist might be proud of achieving .

		Even the birds from far-off parts of the world are shown amidst their native environment .

		It would be hard to find a more captivating pic - ture than
Miss Mitchell	PERSON	's portrayal of the Great Crowned Pigeon of the Papuan and
Solomon Islands	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not to mention others , the studies of the Racket-tailed
Kingfisher	ORGANIZATION	, the Fiery Topaz Hummingbird , the
Elegant Pitta	LOCATION	,
Collie	ORGANIZATION	's Magpie-Jay , and the Central American
Tana	PERSON	- ger , leave nothing to be desired either in beauty or effectiveness of delineation .

		The most ardent bird-lover will hardly be disappointed in this admirable work , which will afford him the priv - ilege of revelling in the study of the world 's birds in print and picture , which is the next best thing to studying them in their haunts , and costs much less in time , money , and effort .

		But how far in the study and under - standing of

		And how much of the '' general , wide - spread turning to the out-of-doors , '' which is now spoken of as one of our national character - istics , would have taken place had not the men who set the fashion been even better worth knowing in themselves than in their writings ?

John Burroughs	PERSON	is himself the '' University of the Catskills , '' offering as good courses in the humanities as in the sciences , -- or , rather , offering a combina - tion of the two such as our other universities have not yet attained .

		Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	has rendered us a similar but sublimer service on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		How much poorer should we all have been had he not possessed an eye to see and a soul to feel the beauty of the great Sequoias , the charm of the Yosemite , and the mystic grandeur of the mountain glaciers ?

		Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	and Mr.
Dallas	PERSON	Lore Sharp , though they confess themselves followers rather than pioneers , have no less potent influence on us , because while leading lives not very different from our own every-day existences they keep themselves in touch with Nature by their interest in `` old roads '' and birds and muskrats -- and even skunks .

		And Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	has proved that women can qualify in this fellowship , doing the same things as man , though always with a difference .

		The selections from these entertaining writers can hardly be expected to please all Nature enthusiasts , for the obvious reason that in a book of selections something has to be omitted .

		But it would have been difficult to choose more wisely , and the choice is wide enough to include four essays each from
Thoreau	LOCATION	and Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, and two each from Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	.

		Half a dozen pictures , from photo - graphs taken especially for this book and repro - duced in photogravure , show typical beauties of our
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	fields and woodlands , appro - priate to the various naturalists ' appreciations of them .

		It is not very often that a new name is added to the roll of these elect , but this is one of the fortunate years .

		People who go to
Estes Park	LOCATION	, in
Colorado	LOCATION	, hear the story told of Mr.
Enos Mills	PERSON	that when he was Government Snow Observer for that State Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	tele - graphed him '' Come at once to
Washington	LOCATION	, '' and that he replied , '' Ca n't ; I 'm too busy . ''

		The new book from his pen , called '' Wild Life on the Rockies , '' gives the story a probable sound , for it shows the absorption with which Mr.
Mills	PERSON	goes about his business .

		It is a delightful book on its own account , but its chief charm is in the revelation of the author 's per - sonality .

		A man who refuses to carry fire-arms in a country where mountain lions and timber wolves are plenty , and who always manages in some way when he encounters them to justify his hardihood , who sleeps out of doors on moun - tain peaks in the dead of winter without blankets or overcoat and often without a camp-fire , who carries only raisins for food and is not disturbed if even these give out for a day or two ; who passes through an electric storm which pulls his hair , binds his muscles , and shakes his heart -- literally -- with no other emotion than that of enjoyment , -- this is the genuine sort of man whose name may worthily be added to the num - ber of our Nature teachers .

		Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's book is written with the simple directness , almost bluntness , characteristic of the man .

		It contains chapters on the snowfall , the forests , the parks , and some of the individual peaks of the Rockies , some excellent animal stories , and a fascinating history of a thousand-year pine .

		Pictures of the author in the door of his pine-shaded log - cabin , of snow-clad crests that he has climbed and camped upon , of Rocky Mountain '' parks '' and forests that he has explored , furnish an interesting descriptive backgroimd for the nar - rative .

		Mr.
Thompson Seton	PERSON	has written '' The Biog - raphy of a Silver Fox '' as a companion volume to the * ' Biography of a Grizzly . ''

		The author calls attention to the fact that the story contains incidents similar to those in Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's story of Red Fox ; but those who know both writers will know that this was mere accident .

		The 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, story is well told , and is as interesting as any of those that have come from this author 's pen -- which is as high praise as a critic could well give .

		Compared with the quite unpreten - tious and simple stories in such a book as Mr.
MiUs	PERSON	's , it perhaps raises the question whether the points are not a little strained -- a little melodramatic -- to represent truly the life of our brothers of the field , who after all have a great deal of the commonplace in their lives , just as humans have .

		The book is artistically bound in blue and silver , beautifully decorated and illustrated , and will be a most acceptable gift - book for children .

		There is much more that might be said in praise of the sort of men who have endeared themselves to us through the study of Nature , but one appreciative thought chiefly abides .

		These men who give so much of their lives to woods and fields and animals might easily des - pise and hate man , for he is almost always the careless and blind self-seeker , and sometimes the wanton destroyer .

		But these writers have no bitter and cruel words .

		In them , the love of Nature has grown so deep that it includes human nature ; and though they deprecate man 's destructiveness they tolerate man himself , and even like him .

		It was a brave saying of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's that '' In the distant tranquil land - scape , and especially in the distant line of the horizon , man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature . ''

		But it is quite as brave and large-minded , now that man has multipled and '' aggressed '' much more atrociously than in
Emerson	LOCATION	's time , to retain the faith that man may still have beauty in his soul .

		America but of the world .

		The '' Darkest Africa '' of the geographer and anthropologist is eclipsed in interest by that of the adventurer and hunter .

		The scientific study of its wild tribes and curious races is giving place to the study of its animal life , particularly its '' big game , '' as its remotest and obscurest regions are illuminated by the flash of
Hunter Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	's rifle .

		Des - patches in the daily papers chronicle his move - ments and achievements as though they were the advance of a conquering army .

		The tale of ''
Roosevelt	PERSON	's bag to date '' -LRB-
May 20	DATE	-RRB- reads like the list of killed and wounded in a battle .

		Among lions , the mortality due to him and his son -LRB- a formidable junior Nimrod -RRB- is stated to be 6 , rhinoceroses 3 , giraffes 3 , wildebeestes 3 , gazelles 1 , hippopotamuses 1 , cheetahs 1 .

		Such by-products of the jungle as pythons and wart - hogs are not counted by the hunters , these being but '' vermin '' and not worthy a place in the '' bag '' of noble game .

		With the above brave showing , the despatch states that '' Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	to-day added a hippopotamus to his big game bag , '' and that he had also '' bagged a female rhinoceros .

		The first shot wounded her in the shoulder and the animal fled to the bushes .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	followed on horseback , and six more shots were required to bring the beast down . ''

		This latter achievement , the despatch states , was on
Sunday	DATE	: '' the seventh day this , the jubilee of man , '' as
Byron	PERSON	sang in his intro - duction to the Spanish bull-fight .

		Later des - patches show that the buffalo season has started in cheerily , '' to-day Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and his son Kermit having succeeded in bringing down their third animal of this kind .

		The bull buffalo wounded by the hunters yesterday fled into the marshes , where he was found and finished off . ''

		It is no wonder , with details as racy as these given daily in the newspapers , that
Africa	LOCATION	is at present a theme of absorbing interest and that books on
Africa	LOCATION	are in keen demand .

		First of these in our present list is that of the Right Hon.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	,
M. P.	PERSON	,
British Under Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	for the Colonies , whose African journey was undertaken primarily for the purpose of informing his countrymen about `` the wonderful estates they have recently ac - quired in the northeastern quarter of
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		On this quest he journeyed from the Indian Ocean to
Victoria Nyanza	LOCATION	, thence through
Uganda	LOCATION	to the navigable waters of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and northward to
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		His conclusion is that
East Africa	LOCATION	is not adapted for any rapid develop - ment by the white man ; the climatic conditions are unfavorable .

		There is a possibility , however ,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 that the country may be made adaptable for the overflow of the swarming millions of
India	LOCATION	.

		Of
Uganda	LOCATION	, however , he writes with almost unreserved enthusiasm .

		All tropical products may be grown there , as the conditions are unusu - ally favorable .

		Railroads and capital are the great requirements for the development of the land .

		If his advice , `` Concentrate upon
Uganda	LOCATION	! ''

		is followed , it will be necessary to connect the two great lakes ,
Victoria	PERSON	and
Nyanza	LOCATION	, by rail , and to advance in a similar way to the waters of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's journey afforded many interesting sights and stirring adventures .

		On one occasion he saw `` an awe-inspiring procession of eleven elephants .

		On they came , loafing along from foot to foot -- two or three ' tuskers ' of no great value , several large tusk - less females , and two or three calves .

		On the back of every elephant sat at least one beautiful white egret , and sometimes three or four , about two feet high , who pecked at the tough hide -- I presume for very small game -- or surveyed the scene with the consciousness of pomp . ''

		At another time , at Murchisan Falls , he fired a shot at a crocodile with surprising results .

		`` What the result of the shot may have been , I do not know ; for the crocodile gave one leap of mortal agony , or surprise , and disappeared in the waters .

		But it was now my turn to be astonished .

		The river at this distance from the falls was not broader than three hundred yards , and we could see the whole shore of the opposite bank quite plainly .

		It had hitherto appeared to be a long brown line of mud , on which the sun shone dully .

		At the shot , the whole of this bank of the river , over the extent of at least a quarter of a mile , sprang into hideous life ... It could be no exaggeration to say that at least a thousand of the creatures had been disturbed at a single shot . ''

		Fancy the commotion among these unsuspecting saurians when Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	gets them within range !

		Mr.
A. F. R. Wollaston	PERSON	, one of five men who made a trip into the
Ruwenzori	LOCATION	region of
Central Africa	LOCATION	in behalf of the
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	department of the British Museum , recounts the story of the expedition in his book entitled '' From Ruwenzori to the
Congo	LOCATION	. ''

		In spite of its being the work of a naturalist , it gives us , with some impressions of the scenery and ac - counts of native customs , much about the '' big game '' sights .

		Mr.
WoUaston	PERSON	's own words set us right about the aim of his book and the impressions which he brought from
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		Africa is a beast , it is true , but a beast of many and varied moods , often disagreeable and some - times even dangerous to body and soul ; but withal she has an attraction which can hardly be resisted , and when you have once come imder her spell you feel it a duty to uphold her reputa - tion .

		So I have attempted ... to convey something of the ' feel ' and smell of
Africa	LOCATION	as it appeared to me on hot and hilly roads , on winding waterways , and on cloud-girt mountain - sides .

		The book contains no tales of thrilling adventures and hairbreadth escapes , nor are there records of ' bagged ' elephants and lions . ''

		Of the '' sleeping sickness '' in the
Congo	LOCATION	region the author makes this observation : '' It is a lamentable fact , but one which can not be gain - said , that civilization must be held responsible in no small degree for the spread of sleep - sickness during the last few years .

		In the old days , when every tribe and almost every village was self-sufficient , and had no intercourse with its neighbors except in the way of warfare , it might very well happen that the disease became localized in a few districts , where its viru - lence became diminished .

		Nowadays , with the opening-up of the country , the constant passage of Europeans travelling from one district to another , and the suppression of native warfare , it is becoming increasingly easy for natives to move beyond the limits of their own country , and by this means sleeping sickness is spread from one end of the country to another . ''

		We do not recall any other writer who suggests that this dreaded disease is contagious or infectious .

		The author speaks ill of the government of much of
Central Africa	LOCATION	and well of the Belgic govern - ment of the
Congo	LOCATION	.

		Few books of travel have more delightful and instructive photographic reproductions than this volume . ''

		The Heart of
Central Africa	LOCATION	'' is mainly an account of a journey made in
1907	DATE	, by Mr.
John M. Springer	PERSON	and his wife , missionaries of the
Methodist Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, across
Africa	LOCATION	from
Umtali	LOCATION	on the
East Coast	LOCATION	to
St. Paul de Loanda	ORGANIZATION	on the
West Coast	LOCATION	.

		Missionaries as a rule are an intelligent class of persons who derive their information at first hand during a long residence in the land they describe .

		Very naturally , their view is that of the forward - looking hope to one divine event -- the conver - sion of the benighted native ; but too often their views are befogged by the hope .

		Such , however , is not Mr.
Springer	PERSON	's case .

		His journey taught him that the mineral wealth of
Central Africa	LOCATION	and the missionary opportunity are closely related .

		When the railroads connect the Southern and the
Northern Coasts	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western lands are linked , the great 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, mineral wealth will be opened to the world -- a wealth that may prove equal to , if not eclipse , that of
Johannesburg	LOCATION	.

		Such an event will make a '' strategic centre for evangelistic activities . ''

		When these railroads are built , the fight with the traders , `` those unprincipled convicts and their class who have dealt in slaves , and rubber , and rum , '' and who have sent '' their emissaries throughout the country disseminating the most atrocious lies , '' will have to seek new pastures or new wilds .

		Mr.
Springer	PERSON	's account of the mineral resources of this rapidly developing continent , of the railroad problems , and of the missionary efforts , makes an entertaining and instructive addition to our knowledge of the now no longer Dark Continent . ''

		This is a most irritating book to read '' -- so Major
F. G. Guggisberg	PERSON	affirms of the book entitled '' We Two in
West Africa	LOCATION	, '' written by himself and his wife ,
Decima Moore	PERSON	.

		The Major , as an old inhabitant of the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and his wife , a new-comer who saw the novelty of things , were both determined to write down their separate impressions .

		A compromise was reached , so that , as he says , '' Throughout the book my wife talks -- I write . ''

		The result is not unpleasing to the reader , and is satisfactory , we trust , to the authors .

		Quite naturally , a part , of the volume is devoted to the ever - captivating subject of gold ; but in these days of modern machinery and the systematic work - ing of the mines , the old romantic flavor and the thrilling experiences of the early adventurers have gone their unromantic way .

		But
Africa	LOCATION	is still an abiding place of the curious and the imusual .

		These are the things which apparently most interested the Major 's determined wife , and which make up a large part of the book .

		A distinctive feature lies in the recounting of the native folk-lore in the vernacidar .

		Readers of folk-lore will find a striking resemblance between these
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	tales and our own Southern folk-tales .

		It would be unjust to the authors of this book to compare it with
Miss Kingsley	PERSON	's '' West African Studies , '' but it has enough merit of its own -- though of a very personal kind -- to commend it as a worthy addition to our well-filled shelf of books on
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Few travel-books are more attractive in their make-up than the volume entitled '' Travels in the Far East . ''

		The author , Mrs.
Ellen M. H. Peck	PERSON	, of
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, who is also the publisher of the book , has apparently expended more money than most authors who publish their own works .

		Cover , type , paper , and illustrations are excellent and illuminating .

		Minor adjec - tives of praise , too , may be applied to Mrs.
Peck	PERSON	's story of her nine months ' tour through
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Burma	LOCATION	,
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	,
Java	LOCATION	,
Siam	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and
Korea	LOCATION	.

		The account of her journey -- one of the established '' Round the World '' tours -- recounts nothing new , but it is enlivened at times by the personal observations of the author .

		Her remarks on the condition of womankind in the Orient testify sufficiently that Mrs.
Peck	PERSON	has a keen interest in whatever affects woman .

		The work can hardly be caUed an illuminated guide-book , though it records her journey in the form of an itinerary of her daily experiences , recounted in letters home to her daughter .

		The reader will will not find an excess of detail nor a burden of historical facts , but he will find enough of both to appreciate Mrs.
Peck	PERSON	's progress .

		Above all , he will take delight in the numerous well-made photographic reproductions .

		Dr.T.L.Pennell , whose book entitled `` Among the Wild Tribes of the Afghan Frontier '' is com - mended in an introduction by no less an authority than
Lord Roberts	PERSON	, was for sixteen years a med - ical missionary , in charge of a medical station at
Bannu	LOCATION	, on the
Northwest Frontier	ORGANIZATION	of
India	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Pennell	PERSON	has , indeed , made an unusually inter - esting and intelligent book .

		Whatever theme he may write about , be it the Afghan character , Afghan traditions , a Frontier valley , a missionary trip , an Afghan football team , Afghan women , the faqirs , or his special theme the medical mis - sions , he writes with such vivid force that the reader does not tire of his minuteness of partic - ulars and details .

		His long experience and his acute observations again prove that missionaries who turn their hand to serious composition have a decided advantage in setting forth the pecu - liar customs and the marked characteristics of a little-known people .

		Those parts of the book dealing with the native superstitions and tra - ditions and customs are the most interesting to the lay reader .

		Dr.
Pennell	PERSON	cites some inter - esting cases as showing the power of charms over the untutored Afghans , -- although he does not comment on its relation to the modern civilized notion of the mind cure . ''

		On more than one occasion , '' he writes , '' I have foimd my prescriptions made up into charms , the patient believing that this would be more effi - cacious than drinking the hospital medicines ; in fact , one patient assured me that he had never suffered from rheumatism , to which he had previously been subject , after he had tied round his arm a prescription in which I had
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 367 ordered him some salicylate of soda , although he had never touched the drug . ''

		It is no won - der that the Mullahs and faqirs grow rich in selling : charms !

		This readable and instructive work deserves a place with other books on
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, notably those by
Paget	PERSON	and
Mason	PERSON	,
Holdich	PERSON	,
Oliver	PERSON	,
Warburton	PERSON	,
Elsmie	LOCATION	, and Ham - ilton ; and it will bear comparison with any of those named .

		After reading Major
Percy E. Henderson	PERSON	's book , '' A British Officer in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, '' with the sub-title '' The Account of a Journey through
Dalmatia	LOCATION	,
Montenegro	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	in
Austria	LOCATION	,
Magyarland	LOCATION	,
Bosnia	LOCATION	, and
Hercegovina	LOCATION	, '' one is astonished to find that nothing is said of war or rumors of war .

		Surely His Majesty 's Officer , '' late of the Indian Army , '' has left the fields of conflict for the tea-table !

		Nevertheless , our astonishment does not end in disappointment , for it is decidedly pleasant to know that these lands have other attractions than tribal feuds and international complications .

		Readers who are interested in the trouble-breeding
Balkans	LOCATION	must look to other books , and to the news - papers ; Major
Henderson	PERSON	's work will not appeal to them .

		But those who are more con - cerned with the domestic manners and the every - day life of the people in pleasure and business , will find the book replete with stories , incidents , and customs of a people who are now -- unhap - pily -- very prominent in the public eye .

		learned since their day .

		Miss
Rose Kingsley	PERSON	offers her tribute to the flower whose name she bears , from the point of view of one bred in ah old garden , bringing to her task '' Love far brought From out the storied past , '' and fostered by the beloved master of
Eversley Rectory	ORGANIZATION	to whose old rose-book she makes a tender reference .

		She makes no claim to nov - elty for what she has to say ; but although the nomenclature of English and American rosa - rians is not always the same , she has written a book which ought to be equally helpful on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		She is particularly to be thanked for her devotion to old-fashioned roses , and gives pleasant assurance that the roses of Tudor days are not quite lost .

		She claims acquaintance with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's musk-rose , which has sometimes been declared to be no longer absolutely identifiable .

		The color plates in this book are exceptionally accurate and beautiful .

		Those of us who have marvelled at the vast stores of experience from which Miss
Gertrude Jeykll	PERSON	has written the long list of garden-books that stand very much to her credit will find pleasure and illumination in her latest work , '' Children and Gardens . ''

		In the pages which make us long for a second youth , she describes her own childhood , frankly placing the date of those happy years so far in the past as to allow more time than we had suspected for the accu - mulation of the wisdom she has shared so freely with her readers .

		No better book -- none so good , indeed -- could be placed in the hands of the children to whom the gardens of the future must look for care and preservation .

		Th6 directions for beginners are clear and practical , the enthusiasm is infectious , and the pictures are altogether charming .

		The chapter on '' Pussies in the Garden '' is full of humor , and the pen-and-ink '' elevations '' and '' plans '' of Pinkie and the kittens are quite without rivals in contemporary art .

		We note with sincere regret that there are but two hundred and thirty-one pages in Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's admirable volume on '' Gardens , Past and Present . ''

		It is so evident that the writer has not spent half of his knowledge in his chapters on the beginnings of English gar - dens -- of old physic , and botanic gardens , and of the wonderful Wisley garden , which form the first part of the book .

		The second part is devoted to sensible and stimulating chapters on various forms of gardening -- formal gardens , rose gardens , water gardens , herb gardens , rock 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, gardens , bulb gardens , bog gardens , and wall gardens .

		The last chapter -- which is the best of all , as last chapters ought to be -- called '' The Opportunities of the Year , '' goes far to make credible the words of the old song , ''
December	DATE	's as pleasant as
May	DATE	, '' since it gives quite as alluring a picture of winter shrubbery as it does of a midsummer brook .

		In '' A Summer Garden of Pleasure , '' notice is taken of earliest
spring	DATE	and latest autumn flowers only in the most casual way -- its author meaning real
summer	DATE	when she says
summer	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Batson	PERSON	has set for herself the task of advising those who do not care for long bars of rest in the bright harmony of garden music , and has given sound counsel as to the attainment of this end .

		Her chapters are invitingly christened `` Incoming Summer , '' `` High Summer , '' `` The Rout of
August	DATE	, '' and so on , with special dis - cussions on the plants to which the garden must chiefly look for help -- iris , peonies , lilies , and the like .

		We can but sigh over the immense climatic advantages which
England	LOCATION	has over us , which are indicated in the text and emphasized in the thirty-one full-page illustrations in color after drawings by
Osman Pittman	PERSON	.

		These trans - cripts of the loveliness of the rich and mellow English gardens give the greatest possible value to this thoroughly delightful book .

		In reading Miss
Helen Ashe Hays	PERSON	's pretty volume entitled '' A Little
Maryland Garden	PERSON	, '' it is a bit disappointing to find that the garden she describes is a new one , made by a trans - planted Californian , with many backward long - ings for the luxuriant growth of the Far West ; whereas we had been led by the title to look for an embodiment of some of the countless charms that distinguish the ripe old gardens of Mary - land .

		The book is cleverly written and attrac - tively illustrated , and gives many a bit of garden-lore and many helpful words in advocacy of the culture of our native flowers .

		It would have been truer to type had it given us pictures of the gardens , generations old , that adorn the river farming communities , the mountain vil - lages , the old inland towns , the older colonial cities , and make the region veritably '' the garden spot of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		From flower gardens to vegetable gardens is not a difficult transition , especially when it is '' The Home Garden '' that is treated , and by so capable a writer as Mr.
Eben E. Rexford	PERSON	, whose newspaper and magazine articles on practical gardening have made him an authority for many years .

		Good sense , and long experience both in gardening and in writing , lie at the foundation of this helpful book .

		The chapters on exposures , soils , fertilizers , and drainage , are particularly valuable .

		The appetite is whetted by the author 's chapters in praise of vegetables , and the day for the coming of the delicious
summer	DATE	fruits seems long delayed when one reads his description of this or that variety .


Sara Andrew ^ Shafer	PERSON	.

		Recent Fiction .

		* Among the younger English novelists there are none more promising than Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	and Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		Both of these men have already given evidence of exceptional quality and of the possession of marked individuality , and both are distinctly strengthening their grasp upon life and growing in expressive power .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	, in parti - ticular , has a way of surprising his readers by unex - pected turns and developments .

		His four novels -- '' Broke of Covenden , '' ``
Henry Northcote	PERSON	, '' ``
William Jordan	PERSON	, Junior , '' and '' Araminta , '' the new one -- are hard to reduce to a single formula , except under some such abstract terms as startling originality and penetrative insight , and it is not easy to think of them as proceeding from the same hand .

		The deli - cious comedy of manners which he has christened '' Araminta '' is about the last sort of thing we should have expected to follow ''
William Jordan	PERSON	, Junior , '' with its rarefied idealism .

		Here we have a story which is on the surface merely whimsical , a sort of literary frolic , and yet a story which leaves us with clean-cut impressions of at least six people , eccentric or affected , it may be , but undeniably real .

		The book has some degree of kinship with the later novels of Mr.
Locke	PERSON	, and even more with Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Halfway House , '' but it is by no means an imitation of anything .

		Its heroine is the daughter of a poor country parson , adopted and brought to
London	LOCATION	-LRB- on a chance -RRB- by her aunt , the Countess of Crewkerne , who is a most delightfully selfish and wicked and malicious and worldly old woman .

		When the girl appears , it is with this phrase of self-introduction , '' My name is
Araminta	LOCATION	, but they call me Goose because I am rather a Sil-lay . ''

		We may as well say at once that she lives up to the descrip tion , for ♦ Araminta .

		THE DIAL 369 she has not an idea in her head , and is incapable of acquiring one .

		Pretty frocks and good things to eat are the highest objects of her ambition , and innocent wonder is a fairly complete description of her out - look upon society .

		But she is a beauty , and , what is more , the living image of her grandmother , whose portrait by
Gainsborough	PERSON	is among the furnishings of her new home .

		Her romance , if such we may call it , is provided by the interest she excites in two elderly gentlemen who become rival aspirants for her hand , and in the handsome young artist -LRB- her childhood friend -RRB- who paints her portrait , falls in love with her , nobly resigns her to her wealthy and aristocratic claimant , and finally receives her back from him in the most surprising fashion .

		A
Goose	ORGANIZATION	she remains from first to last , -- a Featherbrain as she is alterna - tively styled , -- and a Gainsborough portrait come to life , but she is more charming than most heroines of fiction , and the artist is clearly to be envied when he wins her .

		As for the Countess , she becomes in Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	's hands a veritable triumph of character - ization , and almost as much may be said of
Lord Cheriton	LOCATION	, a survival from the age of dandies , whose unexpected generosity bestows both fortune and hap - piness upon the artist .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's new novel is a much more serious affair than '' Araminta . ''

		It is simply en - titled '' Fraternity , '' and , knowing something of the author 's methods and of the intensity of his social sympathies , we may discern a grim irony in that word .

		For fraternity , in any real sense , is far from being the social ideal of any of the vital figures that appear in the narrative ; its sole spokesman is the gentle but half-crazed philosopher who is writing a book on '' Human Brotherhood , '' of which passages are given us from time to time to serve as a sort of Greek chorus .

		Here also is a master-stroke of irony , for this old man is the most futile of all Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's futile characters .

		The others are in various degrees such human beings as we imagine to be normal , creatures of wont and environment , shaped in distinct moulds , sharply individual , with only the dimmest recognition of the solidarity of mankind .

		There are two groups of people in this tale , one comfortable and well-to-do , respectable and decorous in outward bearing , the other sunk in the degradation that comes from mean surroundings and hopeless poverty .

		Both are objects of pity to the author , the former perhaps more so than the latter , if we may judge from his mordant comment upon the emptiness of their life , with its cowardly evasion of moral responsibility .

		These two groups become curiously interrelated in the course of the story , and its nexus is supplied by a random saying of the philosopher whose dream of human brotherhood has rapt him from the sphere of practical thought . ''

		Each of us has a shadow in those places -- in those streets . ''

		In this saying is the very pattern of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's deeply-moving book .

		He has the true method of the artist , and knows how much more effective is reticence than demonstrative emo - tion .

		His picture of human misery , whether it be found in the home of wealth and refinement or in the tenement , is less a matter of description than of suggestion , and suggestion of so quiet and subtle a sort that its force is felt in our after-thought rather than at the moment of its introduction .

		The bur - den of suffering humanity weighs heavily upon the writer 's soul , and he has in a remarkable degree the power of making others share it .

		The sum total of the effect is depressing beyond words , and in this we find the defect of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's method .

		For life is not in reality of the monotonous drab that it seems to him , not even in the slums .

		The larger humanity of a Dickens -- or , taking a modern instance , of a De Morgan -- can find elements of cheer , and even of joyousness , in the most sordid shapes that life assumes .

		The author who obsti - nately refuses to see aught but wretchedness misses the highest artistic mark , and impedes the growth of the very sympathy that he seeks to stimulate .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's books are not without a gleam of idealism , but it is a gleam too remote and wavering to save them from the legitimate accusation of pessimism .

		He should take a lesson from
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, who diagnosed the diseases of modern society with a skill even more unerring , but whose faith in their ultimate cure shone steadfast throughout his work . ''

		The Pilgrims '
March	DATE	, '' by Mr.
H. H. Bashford	PERSON	, is the story of an ingenuous youth of artistic endow - ment , forced by his father 's untimely death to cut short his education , and go into the tea business .

		His employer , a relative , takes the boy into his household , which is dominated by a spirit of intol - erant religiosity .

		Its members are all more or less devoted to lay preaching , missionaiy enterprise , and prayer-meetings , and have all the pet aversions of their kind , regarding with suspicion practically all forms of innocent recreation .

		They are kindly people , perfectly sincere in their prejudices , and the author describes their narrow ways of living without a trace of satire .

		The boy , being impressionable and easily stirred to emotion , yields to their influ - ence , '' experiences religion , '' and is taken into the fold with rejoicing .

		But as he comes to a more complete self-realization , and the claims of art grow more insistent , he frees himself , although not with - out a struggle , from the prison-house .

		Emancipa - tion has its dangers for him , however , and the newly-acquired freedom almost becomes his moral undoing .

		His steps lead him to the very brink of folly , but he pulls himself up just in time to save himself from disaster .

		The psychological interest of this conflict between warring impulses is consid - erable , and constitutes the essential feature of what is , aside from that , a genial and warm-hearted study of life .

		The exposition is not altogether lucid , and the sentimental outcome is abrupt and rather puz - zling ; but one closes the book with genuine regret at parting from the agreeable company of people who occupy its pages .

		Mr.
Lawrence North	PERSON	seems to be a new-comer among our fiction-makers , and his '' Syrinx '' is a novel that we have read with lively interest .

		.

		It is 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, concerned with the doings of a group of irresponsi - ble beings who call themselves '' the polite outcasts , '' who hold all that is conventional to be vieuxjeu , and who affect the eccentric and paradoxical in conversa - tion and demeanor .

		The leading spirit among them is a , prScieuse known as
Aspasia	LOCATION	, although she has a real name of the ordinary wholesome sort .

		When she first appears it is in the country , and she is quoting Sappho -LRB- in the original -RRB- , being caught in the act by a wandering scholar who chances to come that way in his motor-car .

		What he sees is described as '' a form very supple and so flowing in its lines as to disguise its real voluptuousness , a face of perverse attractiveness , very perfect save the mouth , which bespoke over-much emotionalism . ''

		Although a staid and mature scholar , whose ideas '' the Germans revered and wrangled over , '' he suc - cumbs to the charm of the apparition , and the pair are soon speeding toward
London	LOCATION	in the car .

		The young woman is also a scholar , who earns her living by doing hack-work at the British Museum for a famous philologist , and who , in her conversation , '' fenced lightly with Procopius ,
Apuleius	PERSON	, Philos - tratus , de Brantome ,
Casanova	LOCATION	, certain works of
Mendes	LOCATION	,
Mirbeau	LOCATION	,
Pierre Louys	PERSON	, and even the mys - terious volume of the Arab
Sheikh Nef	PERSON	zaoui . ''

		After this statement , we are quite prepared to believe that ' * her knowledge was as surprising as it was shame - less . ''

		The acquaintance thus begun ripens into intimacy , and has the natural consequence as far as the man is concerned .

		But he has numerous rivals , among them the sculptor who models his Syrinx upon
Aspasia	PERSON	's beautiful lines , and in the end a still more elderly scholar carries her off in triumph .

		It is a sparkling tale , perfectly fantastic , diabolically clever , ornamented with descriptions that remind one of '' Ouida '' in her most opulent verbal moods , and with dialogue that recalls '' The Green
Carna	LOCATION	- tion . ''

		Although the hero discovers that pursuit of a polite outcast brings bitterness in the end , he also learns that the zest of the game almost compensates for the final defeat . ''

		The Inner Shrine '' is an anonymous novel that has attracted considerable attention during the course of its serial publication , and occasioned numerous conjectures concerning its authorship .

		It is certainly a striking novel , although highly arti - ficial and even tricky .

		Its chief merits are clever - ness of invention and dramatic effectiveness ; its defects are found in its unconvincing characteriza - tions and its failure to make certain important features of the action seem plausible .

		We can not accept even the leading figures as self-consistent personalities , and the others are hardly more than dummies .

		Directness of speech and a somewhat mystifying subtlety of feeling are the characteristics of the conversational interchange which constitutes the substance of the story .

		The heroine is a young Frenchwoman whose American husband squanders a fortune , and then takes his own life in a pretended duel .

		One of the numerous improbabilities we are required to accept is the widow 's continuing belief that he was slain by his opponent , although the fact of his suicide is a matter of official record .

		The heroine , who has led a gay and irresponsible life in
Paris	LOCATION	, playing recklessly with the hearts of men , becomes suddenly sobered by the double loss of husband and fortune , and comes to
America	LOCATION	to earn her living and enter upon a new life .

		From this time on , we are expected to see in her a model of self-sacrificing devotion , a high-minded woman of the noblest type , and a worthy mate for the
New York	LOCATION	aristocrat who seeks through many chapters to make her his wife .

		This is a little difficult , con - sidering her past , which was certainly one of folly and indiscretion ; and it is at least poetic justice that her past should arise to confront her and wellnigh shatter her new hopes .

		That past is personified in the Frenchman who had been the indirect cause of her husband 's suicide .

		He had slandered her in the Parisian days , and now , two years afterwards , he appears upon the scene in
New York	LOCATION	, and his curious code of honor forbids him to make honor - able reparation by confessing that he had lied .

		He is brought to such confession in the end , but we are given to understand that suicide is his only recourse after such a humiliation .

		Thus must he atone , be it observed , not for his earlier infamy , but for the later weakness of failing to maintain the false - hood that has all but ruined the woman 's life .

		And because he at last does what the merest decency would dictate , we are supposed to admire his moral heroism and deplore his untimely taking-off .

		The mystery of the title given to this novel is not revealed until the close , and is found to involve another subtle point of honor , this time on the part of the woman .

		She has come to care for her American suitor , but upon the numerous occasions when he implores her to become his wife his plea is firmly denied .

		It turns out that this is because he has neglected to enforce his pleadings by the conventional '' I love you '' formula .

		He has stated the fact in indirect ways that place the matter beyond doubt , but he has not used the incantation .

		As soon as the magic phrase escapes his lips , the marble statue becomes the woman of flesh and blood . ''

		There 's only one key that unlocks the inner shrine of all -- the word you 've just spoken .

		A woman knows nothing till she hears it . ''

		And thus the mystification ends , to the satisfaction of all parties concerned except the reader , who is left with a feeling that the mountain has brought forth a ridiculous mouse .

		If Mr.
James	PERSON	had not already preempted '' The Bostonians '' for a title , Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	might have had it for his new novel .

		It would have been an adequate title , and the novel would have been seen to live up to it .

		As it is , '' The Chippendales '' must serve , leaving the reader slowly to discover that he is being called upon to do much more than follow the fortunes of a particular family , that he is presented with a social document of rich and signifi - cant content , that , in short , he has before him an analysis , more minute and penetrating than has been previously made in a single volume , of the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371
Boston	LOCATION	which is a state of mind rather than the
Boston	LOCATION	which is a dot on the map of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Over-elaboration of detail will doubtless be charged against the writer , for he has filled no less than six hundred pages with the sayings and doings of a few Bostonians during the
last two decades of the last century	DATE	; but the very minuteness and inclusiveness of his observation become in the end impressive on their own account , and do not obscure the broader lines in the plan of the picture .

		The
Boston	LOCATION	of which Judge Grant writes is the
Boston	LOCATION	of transition , when the old standards of conduct and thought felt the corroding influence of materialism , when wealth became potent and arrogant , when ideals that had once seemed excellent were relegated to the limbo of old-fogyism , and the survival of the fittest seemed to mean the triumph of the blatant and the mean .

		It is essentially a tragedy , and the author has a deep sense of the seriousness of his theme , although he treats it with good humor , and in the spirit of gently satiric comedy .

		We might almost call the book an allegory of the new
England	LOCATION	conscience , for , despite the firm and vital handling of the individuals whose interwoven fortunes provide the plot , that abstrac - tion is visioned for us from first to last , and we find no element of personal interest quite so strong as the interest which we take in the outcome of the conflict between that severe ideal and the lax easy-going ideals that beset it upon every hand .

		At first , the author seems inclined to make fun of the
New England	LOCATION	conscience , and we are a little worried lest his satirical bent have too free a rein .

		Henry
Sumner	PERSON	, who is that conscience incarnate , is far from being a gracious hero of fiction at best , and in our early acquaintance with him , he seems prig - gish and a bit morbid in his development of self - consciousness .

		But there is steel in his character , and in the end he comes to command our almost unqualified admiration .

		The real vision of his strength is given us , not so much in the incidents of his career , in the causes which he champions , in the principles which regulate his conduct , as in his con - quest of
Priscilla Avery	PERSON	, who derides him , inflicts wanton cruelties upon his sensitive nature , sometimes dislikes him in reality , and sometimes affects to dis - like him , yet is finally , by virtue of her own share in that inheritance of conscience which she can not hold lightly if she will , constrained to find in him , not only an ally , but also an accepted lover .

		In this the most successfully-conceived of his heroines , the author has given us one of the finest studies of character-development to be found in American fiction .

		Having spoken of hero and heroine , the villain of the piece also calls for a word of comment .

		AH three of these terms smack of melodrama , and we would gladly avoid them were others available ; as it is , these must function .

		Our '' villain , '' then , in the sense of being the embodiment of the evil influences that are at work to make
Boston	LOCATION	even as another city -LRB- or state of mind -RRB- , is named
Hugh Blaisdell	PERSON	, and is delineated with truly admirable art .

		Since the issues of this novel are moral and not physical ,
Blaisdell	PERSON	is in no sense a gross offender ; he is simply common , callous , unimaginative , yet at the same time amazingly successful in the world of practical affairs .

		He is the very type of the `` leading citizen , '' everywhere conspicuous in the public eye , associated with good works if they are good also for advertising purposes , a pattern of the domestic virtues , a pillar of church and state , and the despair of every civilization which has not gone wholly over to philistinism .

		Judge
Grant	PERSON	's success in this case is no less marked than in the cases of his hero and his heroine .

		Those who read fiction for entertainment alone will not find their affair in `` The Chippendales , '' and we doubt if the novel becomes a `` best seller . ''

		But we have no doubt whatever that it is a contribution to our literature worth the attention of the thoughtful , and likely to be valued fifty years hence more highly than it will be valued to-day .

		Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	has a crisp method of story-telling that is very fetching in a writer who aims at nothing more than entertainment .

		He wastes no words in getting at the heart of a situa - tion , and he takes care that his plots shall not be too complicated for lucidity .

		His scheme is evidently prepared in advance , and worked out with logical progression . ''

		A King in Khaki '' is a case in point .

		It is the plain and vivid account of the successful management of a tropical plantation on an island somewhere in the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		The manager , who is the '' King '' of the island , has brought the enter - prise to prosperity , and sends a glowing report of its success to the directory in
New York	LOCATION	.

		But this , it seems , is not what is wanted , for a financial pirate is in control at headquarters , who has devised a plan for making the stock seem worthless until the orig - inal subscribers shall have been frozen out .

		He comes to the island , offers the manager a choice between corrupt connivance with the plan and sum - mary dismissal , and finds that he has a determined antagonist to deal with instead of a willing tool .

		The manager hits upon the beautiful plan of holding the magnate in captivity , and going to
New York	LOCATION	himself to publish the facts and protect the stock - holders .

		The plan develops some unexpected fea - tures , resulting from the fact that the magnate is accompanied by his daughter , with whom the '' King '' promptly falls in love .

		But it works out to the right conclusion , leaving no very hard feelings on either side .

		Incidentally , the buried treasure of ''
Calico Jack	PERSON	, '' a pirate of the older fashion who had once made the island his retreat , is unearthed , and provides the means whereby our hero indirectly accomplishes his purpose .

		Mr.
Bannister Merwin	PERSON	, formerly associated with Mr.
Webster	PERSON	in sundry romantic inventions , also has a new story of his very own .

		It is called `` The Girl and the Bill , '' and is a breathless tale of the exciting things that happened to
Robert Orme	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	during a two days ' sojourn in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		In the first chapter , he sees a girl in an automobile , and buys a new hat , receiving a five dollar bill in 372 THE BIAJL -LSB-

		Tliese s ^ ^ iu simple enough mcident & , bat xhej snffiee to plunge him stnughtwav into a wfairi of adrmtiirtt .

		For the girl is the daughter of the Secr ^ ianr of

United States	LOCATION	and GuiiiiBiiy whieh most be dieeoTned and signed by midiui ^ of tlie next dav .

		Now it happens that Bnudl Mid J ^ Mtfi are opposed to the making of this traetyv and Uteir diplomatic representatives are on tke spott prepared to hesitate at nothing .

		The two davs are crowded with lirely incidents , including hold-aps .

		abductions , the wild racing of motor ears , jhi-jitsa , a spirit `` ^ anee , a narrow eeeape from suffo - cation in a refrigentor , and aoeh-like diversions .

		But all the maehinatiwag of tiie allied villains come to DM ^ rt , and the two davs are quite enough to eon ^ nee baro and heroine that they were made for one anather .

		Hie treaty gets signed in the nick of tirae .

		and its foes slink away discomfited . ''

		` The Story of Thyrxa '' is a more s ^ ^ nifieant work than has hitherto come from the pen of Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	.

		It begins simply enough , among the
New England	LOCATION	folk whom Miss
Brown	PERSON	knows so well , and whoee humors she has so deftly and sym - patheticalty diaraeterized in times past .

		Thvrza is a chikl wheak we make her aeqnaintance , and the miniature ecHnedies and tragedies of childhood make op the first half of her stoty .

		She is an engaging child , natural and oonrincing , seemingly fitted into her enyironment .

		bat in reality set aput from her assoeiatee by a gift of originality which amounts almost to genius .

		Her life , outwardly like that of other children , is fed from within upon springs of whidi ahn alone has the aeeret .

		The dream-life of remance wlueh hnegiMtion shapes for her is sud - daily ew fe it ed into the rtvnest of reality when a ▼ Olage swain , a eommonplaee youth whom her fancy has idealiied , betrays her innocent trust , and noakes h ^ the mother of an illegitimato child .

		When she realizes the consequences of her misplaced confi - dence ^ she aeeepts them unflinchingly , refusing to euo ^ ptuBHe with society , or to conceal anght sare the ideadity of her betrayer .

		This despicable oeor ture , idio marries her sister , lives in constant fear of etpu a i i i e. little knowing dw sliaigth of resofai * taon diat binds her .

		for the aster 's sake , to guard the aeer ^ Keeping her maiden name , she brings np her tiuUL , sappcvting him by the severest toil , and has the sattafaction of seeing him through collie , and standing apon the threshold of active life , a fine eaEmple of manhood .

		The hardest of her trials UNuea when the son .

		to whom the vision of love has been mrreiled .

		implores her for the sake of his ^ ■ nfni '' f ' F to aasnme the title of a married woman .

		Bat eren his plea can not prevail over the resolution which has made her attitode toward life , not indeed one of defiance of the social law , but one of uncom - promising acceptance of the full consequences of her girlhood fault .

		Fortunately , the girl in question is bniod ^ unded enough to demand no such sacrifice of principle .

		In the end .

		a sort of mellow sunshine falls upon
Thyrra	ORGANIZATION	's life , when she marries , upon his death-bed , the old friend who had guided her child - hood stops upon the j > athway of knowledge , and who , knowing her story , has remained devoteil to her through all the intervening years .

		She has kept the faith : she has not darkeneil the lives of those nearest and dearest to her : she has paid in full her own debt to society ; she has won .

		after a struggle that we ean but dimly apprehend , a sort of spiritual peaee .

		As the tragic issues of this simple story become more and more evident , the author keeps level with the height of her argument , and her work grows increasingly impressive .

		The compli - cation is one which might easily result in a false stop , but the author 's stop remains assured from first to last .

		The situation offered for our delectation in ''
Wallace Rhodes	PERSON	, '' a novel by Miss
Norah Davis	PERSON	, is not easy to describe in ordinarj - terms , and we will resort to a quasi-diagrammatic exposition .

		There are four principal characters : A -LRB- a devoted father -RRB- , B -LRB- his devoted son -RRB- , C -LRB- a young woman more or less besmirched by slanderous tongues ' -RRB- , and D -LRB- a second young woman who is a designing creature -RRB- .

		When the story opens , B , who has narrowly esca | > ed the allurements of D , becomes engaged to C .

		This is a horrid revelation to A , who thereupon resolves to save the boy by alienating C 's affections from him .

		B is sent away on business , and A improves the opportunity , succeeding only too well , for he per - suades C to marry him .

		B returns , and there is a stormy scene between father and son .

		ending in A 's pledge to keep C for a year , and then relinquish her to B , if the latter so desires .

		As the year goes by , it is marked by the development of a genuine love between A and C. while B. recovering from the blow , renews his allegiance to D .

		This releases A from his pledge , but he has so supersensitive a conscience that he bestows the family estate upon B and D , utterly ignoring C 's wishes , although he is supposed to loye her devotedly .

		Toward the end .

		B gets tired at his engagment with D , and discovers that C is the real object of his affections .

		But the latter will have none of his philanderings , and remains faithful to A. B and C are then duly married , and , we trust , become duly miserable .

		The scene of this preposterous story is a Southern plantation on the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	.

		It is skilfully constructed , and shows not a little com - mand of novelistic technique .

		But no technical merits could make such a plot convincing , or awaken much sympathy for any of the persons concerned .

		Or the hope of profit may have been something more than a subsidiary inducement to abandon city pavements and get back to nature and to mother earth .

		At any rate , the working of a twelve-acre farm , which was later much increased in size , evidently proved profitable , and the narrative leaves the impression that the enterprise had also all the charm of novelty .

		Not only cattle and crops were raised , but violets were cultivated for the winter market , a flock of Angora goats was made to yield handsome returns , quail were produced for the home table and for the market , and various other enterprises were lucra - tively handled by the writer and her corps of assist - ants .

		A literary husband , with a tendency to excessive application when the fine frenzy of author - ship was upon him , yielded to his wife 's seductive arts and occasionally lent a hand in the less gross and prosaic forms of rural toil .

Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, in his In - ftaluut/arlc .

Wright	PERSON	's `` Birds of the
Boston	LOCATION	Public Garden '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , quotes the reply of a noted ornitholo - gist to a bird-student who asked where to look for a rare Warbler : `` Go to
Central Park	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Central Park has many printed records of its birds , and
Chicago	LOCATION	has its little volume on `` Wild Birds in
City Parks	LOCATION	. ''

		It is time , therefore , that the beauti - ful
Boston Public Garden	ORGANIZATION	should have its catalogue of birds , and Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has done wisely in pub - lishing in book form the results of his nine years of observation there .

		The opening chapter tells when bird migrations occur , what species have appeared each
spring from 1900	DATE	to
1908	DATE	, and gives lists of those observed on maximum days , which in the years named have fallen from
May 12	DATE	to
May 20	DATE	.

		Especially interesting are the records that show that certain species of the migrants are likely to make stop-overs , staying from two to seven or even more days in places as well adapted to their tastes as the Garden .

		A list of one hundred and sixteen birds which the author has observed in the nine years forms the principal part of the compact volume , and as the title suggests , is given not for general descrip - tive purposes , but as the record of feathered visitants actually seen in the Garden .

		Several dainty pho - togravures of rare trees in the Garden ornament the book .

		Fishing in ^ ^ - ^ - ^ - Aflalo 's book entitled
California	LOCATION	'' Sunset Playgrounds '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		gives primarily the story of fishing days , and others , in
California	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The author , an Englishman , travelled his fifteen thousand miles with intent to catch a tuna in the waters around
Catalina Island	LOCATION	, off
San Pedro	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	; but only to find that this great gama-fish was not at that time at home .

		Other fish , however , in a measure satisfied his piscatorial desires sufficiently to permit his eulogizing the island .

		At
Trout Lake	ORGANIZATION	, or Fish Lake , in the heart of the
Long Lake Forest Reserve	ORGANIZATION	, between the
Coast Range	ORGANIZATION	and the Selkirks , the writer found his best fishing in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		No reservations need be made in lauding Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	as a thorough-going , sportsmanlike fisherman .

		He delights in light tackle and a small catch , and glories in the environment of natural beauty of forest and stream .

		After the memories of
Tabor	ORGANIZATION	and
Catalina	LOCATION	in the
States	LOCATION	, and Trout Lake in
Canada	LOCATION	, the author is led to say that `` the fishing at home , which of yore gave such keen delight , seems tame , '' and that his travels in two such lands gave him '' some of the most sensational fishing in a fishful life . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The increasing popularity of the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	as a pleasure-ground makes timely the third edition of Mr.
Walter Dwight Wilcox	PERSON	's '' Camping in the Canadian Rockies '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The new edition , which has been largely rewritten and the illustrations for which have been increased by half , is entitled `` The Rockies of
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		It is a large octavo volume , with the finest of photogravure plates to enlist the reader 's interest in the wonderful scenery of the region described .

		Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	was one of the pioneer pleasure-seekers to explore and photograph the country .

		His mountain - eering experiences now extend over twenty years , and his account of them , with the views , gives a compre - hensive picture of the mountains and the mountain lakes , which constitute one of the rarest beauties of the region .

		The approaching Summer always brings a revival of interest in wild flowers , and , by way of satisfying it , a new crop of popular manuals , each with its own partic - ular royal road to the quick and easy knowledge of names and varieties .

		One of the latest is a '' Practical Guide to the Wild Flowers and Fruits , '' by Dr.
George Lincoln Walton	PERSON	-LRB- Lippineott -RRB- .

		It contains very brief descriptions of four hundred flowers and over one hun - dred fruits .

		Its distinctive features are , first , the treat - ment of flowers and fruits in the same volume , and , second , the charts , based on color for large groups , and , for the smaller ones , on simple obvious distinctions of leaf and flower arrangement and flower form .

		These charts are supplemented by a few colored illustrations and a large number of small but clear and useful line - drawings .

		A ''
High School Course	ORGANIZATION	in Latin Composition , '' by Messrs.
Charles McCoy Baker	PERSON	and
Alexander James Inglis	PERSON	, is a recent publication of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Owing to a delay in importing the desired paper , the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	have been obliged to postpone until
Autumn	DATE	the publication of their Riverside Press edition of
Walton	PERSON	's '' Compleat Angler . '' ''

		Under the Deodars '' is the title of a volume of reprinted stories , sixteen in number , by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		It is a volume that includes many old favorites , and is published in their Pocket Edition of Kipling 's Works , by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new impression of Roget 's '' The Sources of English Words and Phrases '' is sent us by
Messrs. Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This standard work , dating originally from the middle of the
last century	DATE	, preserves its use - fulness remarkably well .

		It is announced that Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	has writ - ten a continuation of his latest novel , `` The Halfway House . ''

		Senhouse is the hero of the sequel , and '' The Open Road '' is being considered for its title .

		The book wUl be published early in the Fall .

		It is published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	in a style uniform with
Stephen	PERSON	's other reprinted writings .

		The
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just completed the publication of their Warwickshire edition of

		Messrs.
Sturgis & Walton	ORGANIZATION	publish an edition of
Bulwer	PERSON	's `` The Lost Tales of Miletus . ''

		Just what encouragement they have had for this venture , or what readers they expect to reach , are unexplained matters , for Bulwer the poet has become a negligible quantity in English literature , but here the book is , and one might do worse than give an hour to its pages .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us Mr.
William J. Milne	PERSON	's `` Standard Algebra '' and Dr.
Alvin Davison	PERSON	's '' The Human Body and Health . ''

		From

		He is succeeded by Mr.
Paul Elmer Moore	PERSON	, the well-known essayist , and latterly a leading writer for '' The Nation . ''

		`` Class-Room Libraries for Public Schools , '' now issued in its third edition by the
Buifalo Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is a pamphlet of 166 large , double-column pages , the contents of which show good judgment and admirable care in editing .

		There is first a graded list , for the nine grades of the public school system , then an author and title index , next a subject index , after that a list of reference books , and , finally , a selection of books con - taining stories about children and poetry about children -LRB- for the use of teachers and parents -RRB- .

		The whole must prove useful to both pupils and instructors , and wiU bring the public library into closer affiliation with the public schools .

		BRIEFER MENTION 408 NOTES 408 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 409 AN APOSTLE OF GOO D CITIZENSHIP .

		Early in
1860	DATE	, when the political campaign of that memorable year was opening , one
Timothy Smith	PERSON	, aged seventy-seven , took up a farm in central
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		He was a typical pioneer , bom in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, who had followed the westward movement of the frontier through
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	to the prairies of the
Sanga	LOCATION	- mon. .

		A New Englander of the old Puritan stock , he changed his skies but not his soul as he migrated from farm to farm , and the austere ideals of a God-fearing and hard-working ances - try shaped his life in its successive habitations .

		The harshness of the inherited orthodox theology grew repellent to him as he came to see life clearly for what it was , but the ethical kernel of puritanism was treasured in his thought and conduct after the wrappings had been cast aside .

		His political memories went back to the struggle for the Constitution ; he was successively a
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralist , a Whig , an Abolitionist , and a Repub - lican ; he survived until the struggle for the Union was over , and he died on that startled
April	DATE
morning	TIME	when the news of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's death changed jubilation into mourning , and plunged the nation into the blackest grief it had ever known .

		An American of the kind whose character was typified for the ages in the per - sonality of the great President ,
Timothy Smith	PERSON	lived and died obscurely , unknown to fame , one of the plain people .

		There have been many thousands of such Americans as he , and they have been the salt of the
New World	LOCATION	.

		Someone has said -- was it Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	?

		-- that to educate a man properly , you must begin with his grandfather .

		This thought has recurred to us while reading the memorial volume into which have been collected the more significant writings of
Edwin Burritt Smith	PERSON	, now published three years after his death .

		For
Timothy Smith	PERSON	was the grandfather of the man whose memory is now honored , and an account of the pioneer 's life , written with tender piety , is one of the most notable features of the book .

		As we follow the story of the ancestor 's laborious years , charac - terized by simplicity and stern integrity , we realize something of the inheritance which he was preparing for his descendants , an inherit - ance not of perishable wealth , but of moral fibre and of the qualities that may make the hard '' passage through our slough '' a true pilgrim 's progress toward the celestial city .

		Those who were privileged to know
Edwin Burritt Smith	PERSON	, and to work hand in hand with him in the causes to which his best energies were devoted , have not yet -- probably never will -- become reconciled to his taking-off three years ago .

		He was in the prime of life , his influence was just beginning to make itself highly effec - tive , he had attracted to himself the attention of earnest workers for righteousness in all parts of the country , his grasp and his power were fully developed , and he should have been good for twenty more years of the highest civic useful - 386 THE DIAL -LSB-

		He was a man who would have gone far had that score of additional years been vouch - safed him , but at hardly more than the midway station of man 's active life he was confronted by man 's ancient enemy , and , after a brave struggle , was defeated .

		The vitalizing energy that im - parted itself to his feUow-workers was all that remained ; now we have given us in addition this printed record , drawing for us in broken or fragmentary form a few of the main lines of his endeavor .

		The contents of this volume are about equally divided between local and national questions .

		Nine of the '' Essays and Addresses '' are given to matters of municipal government , some nar - rowed to the special case of
Chicago	LOCATION	, others of more comprehensive scope .

		The author was one of the leading spirits in that Municipal Voters ' League which substituted an essentially honest city council in
Chicago	LOCATION	-LRB- with only a sprinkling of `` gray wolves '' -RRB- for the old corrupt gang that had disgraced the community for many years .

		He was also active in securing for the city a suitable civil service law and an equitable settle - ment of the vexing problem of the street rail - ways .

		He knew that city governments are the chief plague-spots upon the American body politic , that '' no cure can be complete or ade - quate that does not reach the seat of the dis - ease , '' and that '' the recovery of representative government must begin in the cities . ''

		Hence his most fruitful labors were exerted in this direction , and they were made fruitful by the combination of his legal training with the most practical kind of common sense .

		He was ever an idealist , but his feet were always firmly planted on the solid earth .

		The group of nine papers upon questions of national politics are devoted in part to such abstract subjects as the nature of sovereignty , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and the general question of our international dealings , and the deeper implications of democracy .

		In part they voice the sentiment that aroused so many of the finer spirits of the nation to indignation when we en - gaged some ten years ago in a needless war and entered upon an '' aggressive '' foreign policy .

		No one saw more clearly than Mr.
Smith	PERSON	that we were following after false gods and aban - doning the most sacred principles of our national life when we adopted this course , and no one expressed more incisively the better and more sober judgment of the American people in its great latter-day crisis .

		He made himself one of the chief spokesmen of anti-imperialism , and under his leadership the opposition to our fire - and-sword subjugation of the Filipinos took on the characteristics of the holy war against slavery that had been waged half a century earlier .

		In the face of seeming defeat , he never lost faith in the ultimate triumph of the American principle of democracy .

		His creed was expressed when , speaking at the Anti-Imperialist Conference of
1900	DATE	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, he closed with the words : '' We have come to the city of the Declaration of Independence to drink deep at this fountain of human liberty .

		We here renew our faith in self-government , and pledge ourselves to do all that in us lies for its preservation .

		We still cherish the principles for which
Washington	LOCATION	fought and Lincoln died .

		We hold that taxation without representation is still tyranny .

		We declare relentless war on the miners and sappers of returning despotism .

		We will neither compromise nor surrender . '

		Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us .

		Our defence is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men in all lands everywhere . ' ''

		The editors of this memorial volume ,
Messrs. G. L. Paddock	PERSON	,
A. H. Tohnan	PERSON	, and
F. W. Gookin	PERSON	, have performed their labor of love with intelligence and sympathy .

		Mr.
Paddock	PERSON	is the writer of the prefatory '' appreciation , '' and has sketched Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's life simply and clearly .

		He has also inserted a number of letters read at the memorial service of
May 20 , 1906	DATE	.

		From one of these letters , sent by
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, we extract a passage which affords an exact characterization of the man . ''

		In our long conversations , I was impressed by the perfect coordination of his vigorous intelligence with his strong moral convictions and clear moral perceptions .

		He was , like most Americans , an idealist , but his ideals were higher than those of the crowd , and his guide in the pursuit of them was not a blind enthusiasm , but an open-eyed good sense .

		His character was all of a piece , -- simple , sincere , steadfast .

		It was his nature to obey the call of duty , and to follow its path .

		This was the inde - pendence , this was the courage for which he was praised or blamed according to the nature of those who judged him .

		He was an eminent example of the good citizen , and in his death not only
Chicago	LOCATION	but the whole country suffers a great loss . ''

		EDWARD
EVERETT HALE	PERSON	.

		At the celebration of his seventieth birthday
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	was described by
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, with truth as well as humor , as '' the living dynamo , '' -- '' Toiling , still toiling at his endless task , With patience such as Sisyphus might ask .

		To flood the paths of ignorance with light , To speed the progress of the struggling right . ''

		And now that the dynamo is finally at rest , and one contemplates the amount of work it has accomplished -- the varied machinery to which it has been the motive power , the light and heat its electric pulses have furnished to the world , the wireless messages

		THE DIAL 387 of hope and courage and helpfulness it has been the means of sending abroad -- one can not but be more than ever struck with the aptness of the image .

		Cradled in the sheets of his father 's
Boston	LOCATION	'' Advertiser , '' as he was wont to express it , the lad early took to writing .

		So facile was his youthful pen in turning a graceful rhyme that when he was graduated from
Harvard	LOCATION	at seventeen he wrote the poem for the class-day exercises .

		Many other occa - sional pieces of verse , for class reunions and other college or more general celebrations , followed from his pen at different times .

		Perhaps his stirring lines entitled '' Alma Mater 's Roll , '' read at the Phi Beta Kappa dinner at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1875	DATE	, are the best and most characteristic .

		This and other poems , mostly in ballad metre , were collected in his volume of verse which he named '' For Fifty Years '' and published just half a century after he had attained his majority .

		The later volume of '' New England History in Ballads '' is only in part his own .

		Fired with patriotism , his stirring ballads are often very effective . ''


New England	LOCATION	's
Chevy Chase	ORGANIZATION	, '' for example , almost makes one smell the gunpowder burnt at
Lexington	LOCATION	and
Concord	LOCATION	.

		But the incongruity of dwelling on Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's merits as a poet would be recognized by himself first of all .

		In later life he used to advise young writers to give some time to verse-making as an agreeable and useful exercise in phrase-making and synonym-hunting , not by any means as the serious business of life .

		His own noteworthy contribution to literature was in the short story . ''

		The Man without a Country , '' known to thousands of readers in many languages , and the almost equally excellent jeu d' esprit , '' My Double , and How He Undid Me , '' will long be favorites . ''

		In His Name '' ranks with them , and '' Ten Times One is Ten '' has gained an unexampled renown through the many philanthropic organizations -- Lend-a-Hand societies ,
Wadsworth	PERSON	clubs , Look-Up leagues ,
King	PERSON	's Daughters chapters , and so on -- that have sprung from its suggestions .

		There is fame enough in being the author of these short stories , or of the first-named alone , to swell with pride a smaller man for the rest of his life ; but their author , having adorned with swift hand whatever in this department he chose to touch , pushed on to more serious labors .

		The essays in history and biography and travel which , either alone or in collaboration with son or sister , he issued in some profusion , have met with popular acceptance , although , as Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	has expressed it , `` many of us who study history got mad at him , for the moment , as we noted this bit of carelessness and that on his vital and fascinating page . ''

		In fact , his writings had the easy style and freedom from pedantry of familiar letters to friends , even as his platform addresses and to some extent his pulpit utterances had the spontaneity and charm of intimate talks to friends .

		Critics have never accounted him a great orator or a g ^ eat writer ; but the world at large , which knows what it likes and is intolerant of mere scholarship , as it is of humbug , heard him and read him gladly .

		His '' Memories of a Hundred Years , '' the rich reminiscences of a wonderfully observant and many-sided octogenarian , were widely read and enjoyed , both in serial form and as collected into a book ; but they furnished rare sport to the keen and pitiless critics of the
Edward A. Freeman	PERSON	habit of mind .

		`` A New England Boyhood '' and ''
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	and his Friends '' are other important works of a genially reminiscent character , and not intended to be scru - tinized with a critical miscroscope .

		Something of
Walter Scott	PERSON	's , and indeed of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , large - minded indifference to small details belonged to this great-souled man of deeds as well as letters .

		To enumerate his interests and activities , even those having to do with literature and education , would be impossible ; yet a few characteristic points may be briefly touched upon .

		In his first pastorate at
Worcester	LOCATION	, not very long after his father had put through the early railway line connecting that city with
Boston	LOCATION	, he lent a hand in establishing the Public Library and the
Natural History Society	ORGANIZATION	of his new place of residence ; and he also became an active member , and for some time president , of the Amer - ican
Antiquarian Society	ORGANIZATION	, which has its headquarters at
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		He attended the Phi Beta Kappa meetings at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and served as the society 's presiding officer , besides filling the part of poet on occasion .

		Omniverous in his reading , he drew and read more books from the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	in his winters in
Washington	LOCATION	, where for the last five years he held the office of Chaplain to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, than almost anyone else .

		Fiction in large doses he was capable of consuming , together with a wide range of historical and scientific works .

		The learned so - cieties to which he belonged need not here be named , nor the numerous philanthropic organizations of which he was the moving spirit .

		His advocacy of an international parliament and a court of arbitra - tion for the pacific adjustment of international dif - ferences was begun years before the Hague tribunal was dreamed of by others , and it was continued , in season and out of season , until the prophet 's vision was realized .

		No less dear to him was his plan for universal harmony and brotherhood in religion .

		At his last public appearance , not quite two weeks before his death -LRB-
June 10	DATE	-RRB- , he pleaded this cause before the
Massachusetts Convention of Congrega	ORGANIZATION	- tional Ministers .

		Not soon wUl the world again see the like of this New Englander in whose veins flowed the confluent streams of
Hale	PERSON	and
Everett	PERSON	blood .

		Contemplating his massive head , his rugged features , and his tower - ing form , one could not but feel that he had been cast in a special mould and the mould destroyed as soon as it had served its purpose .

		If ever it could be said of anyone that '' the style is the man , '' it must be said of
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	.

		To treat his style as a thing apart from his powerful personality were as futile as to study the rustling of the oak tree 's foli - age with eyes shut to its majestic outlines and mag - nificent proportions .

1909	DATE	.

		I .

		Once more as we approach the completion of the second century since his birth -LRB-
June 28 , 1712	DATE	-RRB- do books and events combine to direct the world 's atten - tion to
Jean-Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	.

		It was at
Mont	ORGANIZATION	- morency that he composed the '' Nouvelle H ^ oise '' and the famous letter to d'Alembert ; it is at Mont - morency that
M. Briand	PERSON	and other celebrities have saluted the author '' with emotion '' as the greatest workman in free science , in free thought ; as the `` triumphant poet of Nature and of Liberty , '' -- all this in dedicating a statue to his memory .

		Mean - while , across the Channel Professor
Churton Collins	PERSON	was giving
Rousseau	PERSON	a rather unenviable place in the last book to which he signed his name , * and Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	was putting the finishing touches to the volume which he has alluringly entitled ''
Jean	PERSON	-
Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	and the Women he Loved . ''

		f It is not a pleasing personality which Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	seeks to reconstruct for us ; it is a characteristic figure , that of the
Rue Emile	ORGANIZATION	at
Montmorency	LOCATION	, -- more characteristic than that of the Place du Pan - theon , for with the three-cornered hat and the long cane the new
Rousseau	PERSON	carries -- a wild-flower .

		We have , this time , the lover of `` God 's out-of-doors '' ; and there is deep fidelity in the sculptor 's conception .

		Finally , the raising of a statue to the '' citizen of
Geneva	LOCATION	'' is no merely formal homage to genius .

		Jean-Jacques remains to-day more than a name in eighteenth-century literature .

		Someone has said that there was a bit of the
Don Quixote	PERSON	in the philosopher whom Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	makes out such a Bel - Ami ; and , whatever the personality may be adjudged , there can be no disposition to belittle the influence .


Rousseau	PERSON	has been a source of inspiration in the framing as in the interpretation of our Constitution ; he has acted upon the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	, besides making it possible ; has acted upon every democratic movement .

		With the break-down of dogmatic Christianity , his senti - mental view has more influence than ever in the religious field . ''

		Rousseauism , in fine , remains a force in the modern world , and it is vain to attempt to discredit it by the primitive expedient of blacken - ing the character of its author . ''

		Contemporary criticism has indeed done more to whitewash than to blacken Jean-Jacques ; and no - where has this tendency been stronger than in the two-volume '' Study in Criticism '' devoted to
Rous	PERSON	- seau by a third English writer , Mrs.
Frederika Macdonald.t	PERSON	A war of ideas and of allegations still wages over the character and inspiration of the man : the spirit of impressionism which he personi - fied is active to-day in art and education and politics .

		under the spell of the '' Confessions '' ?

		The school - boy reads them '' on the sly '' ; the man of letters , -- it has been as true of
Hazlitt	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	as of Daudet in
France	LOCATION	, -- stands them by Montaigne on his book - shelf .

		And since they have erected that statue at
Montmorency	LOCATION	, another has gone up at
Ermenonville	LOCATION	.

		It was there that he died , just a hundred and thirty - one years ago , of an apoplexy : and it is only to-day that the last suspicions of the naturalness of that lonely death , in the presence of Th ^ rfese alone , have been finally dismissed .

		But the man himself -- he is not to be dismissed , even at this late day .

		The dedication of that statue at
Ermenonville	LOCATION	is far from being the last we shall hear of him .

		All our distinctly modern institutions are , in a sense , his monuments .

		II .

		There is , none the less , a new manner of appre - ciation of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		We were used to hearing such declarations as this : '' He announced and prepared the great movement whence has issued modern
France	LOCATION	, '' with superadded compliment in the super - lative .

		Now , the tone is one of apology .

		Popular government , in its turn , is on trial : representative government , the universal suffrage , are no longer signals for prolonged cheering .


France	LOCATION	is to-day ruefully regarding the debauchery of her legislature , quite as we eye the blatant fatuity of ours .

		All this is reflected in the tone of the speeches made at
Ermenonville	LOCATION	, at the unveiling of the statue referred to ; the
Minister of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, orator of the day , confessed that
Rousseau	PERSON	's work can not satisfy us ; confessed that * ' with the swinging of the pendulum , we can readily , and without merit of our own , attest the social false - ness of this or that system , the caducitS of this or that construction . ''

		M.
Viviani	PERSON	concludes that , to do
Rousseau	PERSON	justice , we must take his handicaps into account ; '' we must not crush under the weight of acquired progress the original inventor whose limited powers -LRB- courts moyens -RRB- were in themselves , for the times , a proof of genius . ''

		All this would be trite enough if it were not for the source of the remarks , -- were it not , in short , that democratic
France	LOCATION	now defends the Father of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, where a moment ago she was canonizing him . ''

		Reaction '' has once more set in .

		Outside of
France	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	's influence has been greatest upon education ; it is , then , significant when one reads in a paper on
Rousseau	PERSON	in the latest volume of the '' Shelburne Essays '' * -- a paper that has some - thing to say of the principles worked out in ''
Emile	PERSON	, '' and of that book 's value both as a protest against pedagogical repression and as a volume '' full of sug - gestions of permanent value '' -- this most pointed clause : '' There is a growing belief among a certain class that the fundamental thesis of the book has worked , and is still working , like a poison in the blood of society . ''

		If this be true , if in our modern scheme of education we are making instinct the basis and not experienced judgment , impulse and not control , -- *

		THE DIAL 889 why , welcome then the growing loss of faith in
Rous	PERSON	- seau and his principles .

		For that matter , the evi - dences of sharp reaction remain only too slight ; we find none of them in the little hook on ``
Jean-Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	and Education from Nature , '' translated from the French of
M. Gabriel Compayr ^	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Perhaps it is partly in the hope of developing an opposition , that the essayist has spoken out ; if so , it is evident that he does not stand altogether alone .

		In `` one of the strongest and most earnest books written on the sub - ject in recent years .

		Professor
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	has not merely attacked the modern applications of '' Emile '' : he has not scrupled to name names .

		President
Eliot	PERSON	is , for him , the type of modified Rousseauist ; reminding him of Bossuet 's remark about
Marcus Brutus	PERSON	. ''

		Brutus , '' says
Bossuet	PERSON	, `` kept on talking liberty when he should have been talking restraint , and that in the interests of liberty itself . ''

		t Never were we farther from venturing
Lowell	PERSON	's word : '' We can not trace many practical results to his -LSB-
Rous	PERSON	- seau 's -RSB- teaching . ''

		He threatens rather to become a fetich of criticism -LRB- as Mr.
More	PERSON	has written -RRB- .

		And not of criticism alone ; for in aU the fields where his seed was sowed , in literature , and education , and thought political or social or religious , there has been an action upon us not directly alone , but also as com - municated through five generations of disciples and imitators .

		If it is not everyone who knows so much as the titles of his books , it does not follow that
Rousseau	PERSON	has been overtopped by his contemporaries ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Diderot ; but rather that his ideas have become ours by some mysterious process of absorp - tion .

		Writers of the Revolutionary period , and after , have impressed his thought upon us in countless modifications ; and many of his wddest theories are our plain facts in law or pedagogy .

		It is , after all , something to write of an author that in five genera - tions his audacities have become our commonplaces .

		At times , indeed , his work was but to popularize the ideas of his predecessors .

		This is true of every critic of life .

		A cei ` tain Benedictine monk has written a thick volume concerning the '' Plagiats de Rousseau '' ; Dom Cayot might have been in better business , leav - ing this labor to some candidate for the American doctorate .

		The best of
Rousseau	PERSON	's work was written to the dictation of his own intelligence -- and sensi - bility ; it is he who wrote -LRB- as others have not failed to write after him -RRB- : '' I know my heart , and I know men .

		I am not constituted as any of those that I have seen ; I dare to believe that I am not con - stituted as any who exist . ''

		And where this '' unique '' person was very far from inventing -- where he bor - rowed from
Locke	PERSON	and Montaigne and even Rabelais -- he revivified and transfigured . ' '

		What is genius ? ''

		asks
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	in '' Polonius '' ; '' what but the faculty of seizing things from right and left -- here a bit of marble , there a bit of brass -- and breathing life into them ! ''

		IIL It is because
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	is more than the `` citizen of
Geneva	LOCATION	'' -- is , in fine , the prominent citizen of contemporary
France	LOCATION	that we have already found him -- that such a matter as the course of lectures delivered by
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	before the Soci ^ t ^ des Conferences in
Paris	LOCATION	raised at the time a hubbub such as we could never get up over
Jeffer	PERSON	- son and
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Tom Paine	PERSON	rolled all in one .

		Fancy
Chicago	LOCATION	, for example , expressing its apprecia - tion of one of these men by means of '' Lyric Medi - tations , '' band-music , and '' antique dances by fresh and pretty young girls clad in clear colors ! ''

		Yet these were among the '' f eatm-es '' of the manifesto / - tion against
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	's lectures on
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	, published since then in book-form , both in
France	LOCATION	and here .

		* Bubbling over with malice , written against rather than about
Rousseau	PERSON	, these lectures inspired , not the mass-meeting alone , but such newspaper eloquence as this , used in describing the Sorbonne manifestation : '' A room filled to the crushing - point , an enthusiastic crowd , eloquent apologists , -- nothing was lacking to clear the memory of this universal thinker . ''

		How natural that neither facts nor logic should preoccupy his followers , since the leader him - self appealed to all that is below , and to much that is above , the Reason !

		One is fascinated by the fine humor of it all .

		That demonstration against
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	's lectures was not organized in his publishers ' interest , as one might suspect .

		It was even taken quite seriously by the radicals of
Paris	LOCATION	, of all
France	LOCATION	, of Switzei ` land .

		They sent their delegates ; the
Government	ORGANIZATION	sent its minister .

		We Americans reserve our pyrotechnics and hysteria for presidential elections , and maintain a perfect indifference , en masse. , where a candidate 's personality is not concerned .

		As a people , we under - value ideas quite as we overrate action .

		We do not see in ideas , as a people of philosophic temper must , the springs of that action we so blindly exalt .

		Mean - time ,
France	LOCATION	has paid her rather absurd homage to the '' founder of modern society . ''

		And yet the futility of developing or seeking to develop a ''
Rousseau	PERSON	philosophy '' is realized even in
France	LOCATION	.

		The contradictions that his genius offers are not only contradictions between doctrine and practice , but between doctrine and doctrine .

		His panegyrists themselves confess that one must look to
Rousseau	PERSON	for tendencies rather than for a system .

		In his '' First Discourse '' -- upon the Arts and the Sciences -- he maintains that man is naturally virtu - ous ; that he is a victim of that corrupting influence which we broadly describe as '' civilization . ''

		In the very starting-point -- in this insistence upon the superiority of the `` state of nature '' -- lies the root of the evil .

		That the theory leads , logically , back to savagery itself , as the ideal state , was pointed out even lay

		390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, dwells upon his failure adequately to describe what he meant by Nature as the primal som ` ce of the con - fusion into which discussion of his theories plunges us .

		Nor is all this an academic matter .

		Leaving the question of education aside ,
Rousseau	PERSON	's influence is marked upon contemporary leaders in every field of thought and of endeavor ; he has innoculated the whole world with his sentimental optimism and his humanitarian ideals .

		Nowhere is this more true than in the north of
Europe	LOCATION	; one sees his formulas at work in
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's dramas , unsettling and inconclusive as they are ; the influence has affected publicists , too : Dos - toievsky is one of them , in
Russia	LOCATION	; Tikhvinsky another . ''


Rousseau	PERSON	has been my master since the age of fifteen , '' writes
Tolstoi	PERSON	in a letter .

		One is tempted to cite the brilliant sayings of
Lemaitre	PERSON	in the book he has written so lately .

		The crux of it is here : seeing in the '' H ^ loise , '' the ''
Emile	PERSON	, '' the '' Social Contract , '' and the other books , only so many expressions of the chaos reigning in the writer 's own life , one is spared the task of recon - ciling the irreconcilable .

		We need not quote
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	's sallies at
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's expense .

		It requires no Chesterton -- no Lemaitre -- to compose para - doxes about him .

		Rousseau sowed truths and half - truths with an open hand , and expressed them in terms of life .

		He expounded and maintained the Social Contract , and precipitated the Terror .

		He preached religious toleration , and declared that those who could not accept the '' Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar '' ought to be put to death .

		He composed the '' Devin du Village '' ; to equalize mat - ters , he wrote the letter against stage-performances .

		Of all his works , none is more truly the product of his peculiar genius than the book of which he could write to a friend : '' You know well that the ' Nou - velle
Hdloise	PERSON	' should not figure in the list of my writings . ''

		He preached the cult of virtue , -- only it was vice masquerading in her sister 's robes .

		Lastly -- most notoriously -- he dwelt upon the parent 's duty to his children , and sent five infants , one after another , to the foundlings ' home .

		These are some of the facts about
Rousseau	PERSON	, some of the issues of the controversy .

		Twenty years after writ - ing his essay on Jean-Jacques ,
Lowell	PERSON	spent several weeks in re-reading him . ''

		A very complex char - acter , '' was the conclusion he came to ; '' one feels as if the two poles of the magnet were somehow mixed in him , so that hardly has he attracted you powerfully , when you are benumbed with as strong a shock of repulsion .

		... A monstrous liar , but always the first dupe of his own lie . ''

		IV .

		It is precisely because
Rousseau	PERSON	is the precursor of modern society and of modern literature , eulogized by his partisans , that such a critic as
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	takes up the cudgels against him , and
M. Lasserre	PERSON	^ the writer of a treatise upon French romanticism , brands him an anarchist ; * while to Richepin and * Le Romatisme Francais .

		Par
Pierre Lasserre	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	,
1907	DATE	, Ernest-Charles , and the other radicals in poetry and journalism and politics ,
Lemaitre	PERSON	and
Lasserre	PERSON	seem friends , not of '' order , '' but of the old order -- the ancien regime .

		There is no middle ground in the
France	LOCATION	of to-day : one is atheist , revolutionist -LRB- i. e. , social revolutionist -RRB- ,
Rousseauist	LOCATION	, -- or else one is Catholic-reactionary .

		It is not greatly to be won - dered at if the book of a former '' Nationalist '' poli - tician is attacked by these rhetorical radicals ; nor is it to be doubted that they will denounce Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's book .

		The one challenges remark by its glittering cruelty of phrase ; the other attracts attention as a good , specimen of that '' documented '' history which is the specialty of our little age , and as something shabbier even than court-memoirs at their most sor - did .

		As for
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	's volume , it shows us at least how the tide is running in some channels .

		The descendants of the Jacobins of '89 and '93 have expelled the last of the monks and have stripped the Church of its property ; they have added to
M. Briand	PERSON	's ministry of '' cults '' the administration of justice ; what then of the astonishment if the '' friends of restraint , '' the enemies of that individualism which , according to
M. Lasserre	PERSON	, has meant the ruin of the individual , describe the philosophy of
Rous	PERSON	- seau as '' the most subversive ever let loose among men '' ?

		Now the
Genevan	PERSON	is likened to a virus ; now he is a raging lion , a miserable , a Protestant .

		For your reactionary in literature as well as in poli - tics , his crime consists , in g ^ eat part , in having engen - dered modern romanticism , -- the genius of evil , the mal moderne .

		In condemning with a fine impar - tiality both Romanticism and
Rousseau	PERSON	, le roman - tisme integral ,
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	contents himself with observing that there is not a theory , not a system , not a form of sensibility , such as passes by the name of `` romantic , '' that does not proceed from Jean -

Michelet	PERSON	, -- such , '' concludes the critic , `` are the literary offspring of Jean-Jacques . ''

		Why not say , briefly , modern French literature ?

		It is not easy to know what to think .

		Perhaps all these lectures and demonstrations and critical essays and statues and histories of the-women-he - loved will have the happy effect of sending some of us back to the writer himself ; we are bound to find something worth while there , since we may either amuse ourselves by picking flaws in his books , or taste a pleasure of the sensuous sort in absorbing that richness of style and enjoying the delights of vagabondage , of greatness , and of caressing the sensibilities .

		We can not -- to look at it from that standpoint -- we can not , at any rate , wholly despise the problems presented by one whose '' Discourse upon Equality among Men '' meant so much to the signers of our own '' Declaration of Independence '' ; whose treatise upon education , shaped as an account of that promising young Emilius , is doing its work

		THE DIAL 391 whenever we apply the elective system at our colleges .

		Let us hope that by the time we have re-read some of his books there will have been published an accoimt of
Rousseau	PERSON	that shall be at once scholarly , sane , and convincing .

		One expects extremes in any discussion of a man who was both more and less than philosopher and novelist and reformer of society and educational innovator and revolutionist -LRB- religious and political -RRB- ; most of all must one look for extremes in the French criticism of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		It will be much if his disciples keep theii * promise to give practical vent to their enthusiasm , and the Jean-Jacques Society of
Geneva	LOCATION	issues its critical edition of his works -- not collected for more than three-quarters of a century , and never definitively published .

		That is not enough : the controversial state of opinion suggests -- notwithstanding the fact that each year produces its crowd of new books on
Rousseau	PERSON	-- our need of such a study of him as I have just referred to .

		Though we have Lord
Morley	PERSON	's biography , thirty busy years have passed since its appearance .

		We await a new presentation , -- but who is competent to undertake it ?

		The writer must be something of a philosopher , for he has an idealogue to consider ; he must also be a critic of poetry , for
Rousseau	PERSON	engendered an age of lyricism .

		Lastly , he must approach his task without too com - plete an ignorance of social and political issues ; and yet he must not mix his politics and his belles - lettres as hopelessly as the French do .

		It is not likely that we shall soon have that satisfactory study of Rousseau : he is almost too completely the first great cosmopolitan , and the link of past and present .

		Besides , where is the critic and philosopher whom I have j ust described ?


Warren Barton Blake	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		An author of inscriptions on stone , bronze , and other perdurable substances , can more confi - dently predict a long life for his productions than can the writer of books .

		That President Eliot -- or , as we must now say .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	, since his relinquishment of authority to President
Lowell	PERSON	-- is one of the most prolific and successful writers of inscriptions our country has known , has not been borne in mind by everyone in the chorus of eulogy that has accom - panied his retirem ^ t from high office .

		The twelve tablets on the splendid Water Gate at the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, the fine inscription on the
Robert Gould Shaw	ORGANIZATION	monument in
Boston	LOCATION	, and the eloquent words inscribed on the Soldiers ' Monument on
Boston	LOCATION	Common -- these are among the best - known examples of his admirable taste in the choice of forceful and fitting eulogy for monumental pur - poses , although few who have read these examples of terse and elegant English know from whose pen they came .

		It is hoped that the beautiful marble
Union Station	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	and other notable structures now in building on Capitol Hill will be adorned with appropriate epigraphs from the same skilful hand .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's long practice in presenting candidates for academic degrees , each with a preg - nant word of suitable characterization , must have helped to develop in him this faculty for turning well-rounded and marvellously compact phrases for use on public monuments .

		Why would not a course in inscription-writing be good for students in the English department ?

		No better corrective of dif - fuseness and vagueness could be devised .

		Further - more , as already remarked , no work of literature has so favorable a chance of surviving the ravages of time as the inscription .

		In the far-distant future the excavators of buried
Boston	LOCATION	may unearth the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	tablet , but find the books of the neighboring Athenaeum and Public Library all crumbled to dust .

		It is true the writer 's fame will be anonymous , but so is that of the composer of the imperishable lines on the
Rosetta Stone	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two opinions of
Shelley	LOCATION	, violently in contrast , and each having the authority of a great name -LRB- though the greatness in one case has not yet been established on a broad and everlasting basis -RRB- , chanced to come to our notice almost simultaneously .

		They afford a good illustration of the notorious disagree - ment of critics , and help to strengthen the plain man 's confidence in the worth -LRB- to himself , at least -RRB- of his own judgment .

		In
Hazlitt	PERSON	's essay '' On People of Sense '' occurs this passage : '' Poetry acts by sym - pathy with nature , that is , with the natural impulses , customs , and imaginations of men , and is , on that account , always popular , delightful , and at the same time instructive .

		It is nature moralizing and idealiz - ing for us ; inasmuch as , by showing us things as they are , it implicitly teaches us what they ought to be ; and the grosser feelings , by passing through the strain - ers of this imaginary , wide-extended experience , acquire an involuntary tendency to higher objects .

		Shakespeare was , in this sense , not only one of the greatest poets , but one of the greatest moralists that we have .

		Those who read him are the happier , bet - ter , and wiser for it .

		No one -LRB- that I know of -RRB- is the happier , better , or wiser for reading Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's Prometheus Unbound .

		One thing is that nobody reads it .

		And the reason for one or both is the same , that he is not a poet , but a sophist , a theorist , a controversial writer in verse .

		He gives us , for representations of things , rhapsodies of words . ''

		And so on , with increasing severity .

		The gratui - tous element in this introduction of
Shelley	LOCATION	, who was still living , is what most strikes the reader .

		In sharp contrast with
Hazlitt	PERSON	's condemnatory outburst is the glowing eulogy of Shelley from the pen of the late
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, published first in '' The
Dublin	LOCATION	Review , '' where it attracted so much attention as to make necessary a second edition of the number containing it , and now republished in book form .

		Readers will note with interest the fuller account of it given elsewhere in this issue of The Dial .

		392 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, The death of
R. Nisbet Bain	PERSON	, at fifty-four , takes from the world of letters a man of varied talents , of admirable industry , and of noteworthy achievement .

		His position of assistant librarian at the British Museum gave him ready access to and familiarity with departments of literature in which the workers are comparatively few .

		In
Scandina	LOCATION	- vian and in Slavonic history he made himself an authority , and published a number of books . ''

		Gus - tavus III .

		and his Contemporaries , '' ''
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		and the Collapse of the Swedish Empire , '' '' The Pupils of
Peter the Great	PERSON	, '' with works on
Peter	PERSON	's daughter the
Empress Elizabeth	PERSON	and his grandson
Peter III.	PERSON	, and one entitled '' The First Romanovs , 1613-1725 , '' are among his more important pro- ductions .

		An excellent life of
Hans Andersen	PERSON	also came from his busy pen a few years ago ; and be - tween whiles he amused himself with turning several of
Jdkai	ORGANIZATION	's romances from Hungarian into English -- his struggles with the idiosyncrasies of that fearful and wonderful language being touched upon in his preface to '' The Hungarian Nabob . ''

		Ruthenian and Russian and Finnish and we know not how many other difficult tongues were mastered by him , in a literary way .

		In his fondness for hard brain - work he was a veritable glutton , and one can not but suspect that the indulgence of this appetite may have shortened his days ... The foreigner 's opinion of English spelling may not be exactly what the native imagines it to be .

		Professor
Albert Schinz	PERSON	of
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	, whose mother tongue is French , and whose practical acquaintance with our language is of recent date , contributes a noteworthy article to '' The North American Review '' on the prospects of English as a world-language .

		Our spelling reformers have urged the need of simplified spelling if other nations are ever to accept English as the international speech .

		But Professor
Schinz	PERSON	declares our spelling to be no source of trouble to the foreigner ; it is our pro- nunciation that chiefly worries him , and this is simply incapable of phonetic representation with our alphabet .

		If , he says , the spelling reform move - ment '' proposes to make English more acceptable to strangers as an international language , it is en - tirely mistaken and had better stop its campaign at once . ''

		A final word of good sense is uttered on the undesirability of letting any one language suffer the flattening and de-individualizing that must result from its adaptation to universal use .

		Thus do there seem to be more reasons than a few why English should continue to be uncompromisingly itself , with all its written and spoken marks of sturdy individ - uality ... , The handwriting of culture , or at least the handwriting of persons who write much , tends for some reason toward the perpendicular .

		The pen - manship of men of letters in more recent times has generally been small , compact , and approaching the upright .

		Thackeray ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Eugene Field	PERSON	, all wrote the small , vertical hand that is so economical of space and commonly so easy to read .

		That this time-and-space-saving style is a modern development admits of obvious explanation .

		The larger , slanting , more conven - tional handwriting of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	and his contem - poraries was in harmony with the leisure and formality of a less-crowded age .

		It must be chiefly the more or less instinctive effort to save time that now causes a writer 's style to strip itself of super - fluities to an increasing extent as he gi-ows older -- and this of course has a wider application than to mere script .

		Strange , in view of these facts , is the reaction now showing itself in some quarters against the teaching of vertical penmanship .

		In
France	LOCATION	, for example , where educational details of this sort are intelligently ordered , a special commission has just reported in favor of a return to the old-fashioned forward-tipping script , and this for both ophthal - mological and orthopaedic reasons .

		Yet one might safely wager that the French children of to-day who are to be the litterateurs of to-mori `` ow will let no polysyllabic pronouncements of government com - missions stand in the way of a more serviceable form of penmanship when the stress shall come upon them .

		.

		, , A CASE OF inverted PLAGIARISM , as one critic expressed it , is seen in the latest play of the popu - lar German playwright ,
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	.

		His ''
Griselda	PERSON	, '' as reports from
Berlin	LOCATION	describe it , appears to be a violent departure from tradition .

		Boccaccio and
Chaucer	PERSON	and all the other countless chroniclers of the heart-rending history of the patient Griselda would certainly be astonished to behold what the German writer has made of her .

		There comes upon the stage , not the meek , long-suffering , beautiful and virtuous wife of the old story , but a loud-voiced , muscular , short-waisted , square-framed , raw-boned , and hard-fisted peasant Mddchen , ever ready with the weapons wherewith nature has equipped her , and even resorting in extremity to such handy accessories as knives and buckets of water .

		Her vituperative explosion , ' ■ ^ Du hist ein Schweinhund '' to her lover , is the acme of un - Griselda-like language .

		One critic has suggested that an allegory is intended , and that this belligerent
Griselda	PERSON	is meant as an impersonation of
Germany	LOCATION	asserting herself after a period of comparative subor - dination and tarnished repute among the European powers .

		Here is food for English fancy and pos - sible cause for wild alarm in ATbion .

		Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	at ninety may well be accounted the pride and joy of literary
Boston	LOCATION	-- if not of unliterary
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- if such there be -RRB- as well .

		The day that saw her entrance upon the
last decade	DATE	of a full century brought her more than her usual number of birthday tributes and honors , and closed with a family dinner party , at which , besides her son and daughters , a good number of grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren were present and joined in the demolition of twenty or more birth -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 393 day cakes that had arrived during the day -- cake enough , in fact , to enable the recipient to accomplish the impossible feat proverbially associated with that particular edible .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's long survival of her famous husband , who died a third of a century ago at the age of seventy-five , combines with her own marked and gifted personality to render her fame a thing quite apart from his .

		Eight years ago we were celebrating the centennial of Dr.
Howe	PERSON	's birth .

		It is by no means wild or extravagant to cherish now an increasing hope that Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	may herself be with us to join in the celebration of her hundredth birthday in
1919	DATE	.

		The cipher microbe works fearful havoc with common-sense when it once gets into the brain .

		The patient sees ciphers everywhere , and every page of print becomes a puzzle in acrostics .

		Mr.
W. S. Booth	PERSON	's late astonishing performance , '' Some Acrostic Signatures of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	, '' might be taken for either the jeu d'esprit of a wag or the insane utterance of a monomaniac , were it not that the author is regarded by his friends as a rational being writing in a serious mood .

		If anyone has the curiosity to make the experiment , he will be surprised to discover how easily , by the Boothian mode of procedure , acrostic signatures , whether of
Bacon	LOCATION	or of Booth or of anyone else , can be ciphered out in any piece of prose or verse , even in the col - umns of his daily newspaper .

		We do not need , though it is reassuring enough to have it .

		Dr.
Rolf e	PERSON	's verdict that the Booth '' discoveries '' are not likely to prove any more significant than `` the foolery of
Donnelly	PERSON	and the other cipherers . ''

		A STAGE CENSORSHIP BY REPUTABLE ACTORS is a suggestion that has in it both novelty and promise .

		Such a plan is announced as under contemplation by the
Chicago	LOCATION	branch of the
Actors ' Church Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, a body that includes not only members of the the - atrical profession , but also ministers and laymen interested in raising the standard of the acted drama .

		It is proposed to institute , as a permanent function of this branch of the
Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, a discussion of all modern plays presented in
Chicago	LOCATION	, with special reference to their moral character and their influ - ence on society .

		This is a movement for reform from within -- the only real reform -- which is of good augury .

		The inevitable notoriety and malo - dorous success given to objectionable plays by loud and public denunciation from without may be at least partly avoided by quiet and intelligent action on the part of conscientious players themselves .

		Abdul Hamid the book-collector having re '' tired -LRB- reluctantly -RRB- from the business of misgoverning
Turkey	LOCATION	, his fine assortment of Oriental books and manuscripts at the
Yildiz Kiosk	ORGANIZATION	will now probably be made less inaccessible to students and to other interested visitors .

		Literary treasures gathered during the fourteenth , fifteenth , and sixteenth cen - turies from Greek monasteries , and at first stacked away in the library of the old seraglio , are soon likely to find more appreciative readers than the women of the harem .

		The new Sultan ,
Rechad Effendi	PERSON	, otherwise Mohammed the Fifth , is said to be a book-lover , somewhat of a poet , and not with - out liberal ideas .

		His Turkish translation of a volume of Persian poems is commended by connois - seurs as a meritorious piece of work .

		It is to be hoped that as soon as he and his family get well settled after their
spring	DATE	moving , he will open his library doors , and open them wide .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THEODORE
ROOSEVELT	PERSON	AND THOMAS PAINE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Replying to the letter signed '' Inquirer , '' in your issue of
June 1	DATE	, 1 regret to state that it is only too true that
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, in a work intended to pass for authentic biography , did apply to
Thomas Paine	PERSON	the triply false description cited by your correspondent , which called out the just reprehension of the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' as quoted .

		The expression occurs in the biography of
Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	.

		I have not the book at hand , and hence can not give the chapter or page ; but it will be readily found , as forming an extraordinary feature of the excuse given for
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's failure to interfere on
Paine	PERSON	's behalf , when the latter was impris - oned in
France	LOCATION	, and menaced with death .

		It is still more unfortunately true that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's attention has been called to his error , but that he has failed to find time for the re-examinatiou which he had promised ; and the gross misrepresentation forms part of the latest editions of the biography .

		During the closing months of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's presidential term , he refused even to see Mr.
M. M. Mangasarian	PERSON	, the well-known Liberal lecturer of
Chicago	LOCATION	, who made a trip to
Washington	LOCATION	for the express purpose of laying the detailed facts before Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and offering him an opportunity to honor himself by making this centennial year of
Paine	LOCATION	's death an occasion of performing an act of tardy justice to his memory .

		The enormous national ingratitude to
Paine	PERSON	stands recorded as one of the most serious blemishes in the history of the Republic ; but the false picture created in the public mind by a most discreditable theologicum odium has begun to give place to a true appreciation of the inestimable services rendered to American liberty by the Author-Hero of the Revolution .

		The now classic biography of Paine by the late
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	dealt the final death-blow to the anti-Paine myth .


James F. Mortox	PERSON	, Jr. .


New York	LOCATION	,
June 5 , 1909	DATE	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In reference to the inquiry of a correspondent in the issue of your journal for
June 1	DATE	-LRB- p. 360 -RRB- as to Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's responsibility for a term of rank opprobrium applied to
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, as charged and severely rebuked by the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation , '' I beg to submit the following : It would be pleasant to believe that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	did not refer to
Thomas Paine	PERSON	as a '' filthy little atheist . ''

		It seems incredible that the man who has sounded from 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, the housetop the tocsin of a '' Square Deal '' could be guilty of so great an injustice , or could lower himself to the use of billingsgate in a supposedly serious literary production .

		Unfortunately for Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's reputa - tion , however , there can be no doubt as to his responsi - bility for the vile and absolutely false epithet which he bestowed upon one of the truest patriots of all time .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's attack upon
Thomas Paine	PERSON	will be found in Chapter X. of his life of
Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	, in the American Statesmen series , edited by Mr.
John T. Morse	PERSON	and pubhshed by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As he uses the words '' filthy little atheist '' with - out quotation marks , he evidently claims them as his own .

		I append the interesting passage in which the words occur .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	is speaking of
Paris	LOCATION	at the time of the Jacobin uprising , when
Morris	PERSON	was American Minister to
France	LOCATION	. ''

		One man had a very narrow escape .

		This was
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, the Englishman , who had at one period rendered such a striking service to the cause of American independence , while the rest of his life had been as ignoble as it w ; is varied .

		He had been elected to the Convention , and , having sided with the
Gironde	LOCATION	, was thrown into prison by the Jacobins .

		He at once asked
Morris	PERSON	to demand him as an American citizen ; a title to which he of course had no claim .

		Morris refused to interfere too actively , judging rightly tliat
Paine	PERSON	would be saved by his own insignificance , and would serve his own interests best by keeping still .

		So the filthy little atheist had to stay in prison , ' where he amused himself with pub - lishing a pamphlet against Jesus Christ . '

		There are infidels and infidels ;
Paine	PERSON	belonged to the variety -- whereof
America	LOCATION	possesses at present one or two shining examples -- that appar - ently esteems a bladder of dirty water as the proper weapon with which to assail Christainity . ''

		THE IMPORTATION OF COPYRIGHTED BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Owing to my absence in the country , I have only to-day had an opportunity of reading the communication from Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	and Mr.
Cutter	PERSON	-LRB- representing the
American Library Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- printed in The Dial of
May 16	DATE	, concerning the matter of the importa - tion of copyrighted books -- a communication written , as the Librarians state , for the purpose of correcting certain so-called `` glaring misstatements '' contained in a letter of my own which was printed in The Dial of
April 16	DATE	.

		The main purpose of my letter was to point out a serious anomaly in our new Copyright statute in the provision concerning the importation of copyrighted books .

		The law undertakes to give to the author and to the author 's assigns '' exclusive control '' over his pro- duction -- such control as is given under all the copyright statutes of the world .

		Our law includes , however , certain provisions which practically do away with such control .

		I pointed out that the clause in the law of
1891	DATE	con - ceding to librarians , to associations , and to individuals the privilege of importing , without reference to the permis - sion of the owner of the American copyright , books that had secured American copyright , constituted a material change in the existing Copyright law of the
United States	LOCATION	and made this law inconsistent with the Copyright laws of other countries .

		I stated further that this provision was '' interpolated into the Act during the last days of the Session , '' and '' without any opportunity being afforded for considera - tion or discussion . ''

		The Librarians call this '' an abso - lutely false statement , '' and point out that the matter was '' debated in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	on several occasions . ''

		It was perfectly evident from the context that my statement had reference not to discussions in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, but to consideration in the conferences and at the
Congressional	ORGANIZATION	hearings .

		The law of
1891	DATE	was brought into shape after conferences and hearings before the Congressional Com - mittees , which had gone on during a term of nearly five years .

		I speak with personal knowledge when I state that at no time during these conferences , or at any one of the hearings before the
Committees of Congress	ORGANIZATION	at which those having a right to be heard on the subject of copyright were asked to present information for the guid - ance of the members , was any suggestion brought up for the undermining of the well-accepted principle of the American Copyright law in regard to the '' absolute con - trol '' being conceded to the owner of the copyright .

		This proposition for a practically unrestricted importation of copyrighted books was first brought up in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	after the conferences and hearings had been closed , and without any opportunity being given to those having knowledge of the subject for making clear to the Senators the neces - sary result of such a material change in the Copyright statutes .

		A similar course of action was taken in the final shaping of the statute that has just been enacted , several important provisions in which were materially modified after all the hearings had been terminated , and when it was supposed that the bill , as brought into print at the close of the hearings , represented a final consensus of opinion on the essential matters that had been in controversy .

		Your correspondents contend further that my state - ment that the Copyright law of
Great Britain	LOCATION	secures for the owner of the copyright and for his assigns any such exclusive control of copyright , or authority to prevent the importation of foreign editions of the books so copyrighted , is '' absolutely unfounded . ''

		I have for many years had some direct knowledge of and experi - ence in the business of buying and selling books in
Great Britain	LOCATION	for import and for export , an experience which is apparently not possessed by your correspondents .

		I may point out to them that if they would undertake to bring into
Great Britain	LOCATION	a Tauchnitz edition of an Eng - lish book that was still under the protection of English copyright , or a German edition of such copyrighted English book , or a Tauchnitz edition of an American book that had secured English copyright , or an American edition of an American book that had secured English copyright , they would find that my statement was abso - lutely correct , and that the provisions of the existing English statute do give exclusive control , which , as pointed out , is an essential factor in a consistent and equitable Copyright law .

		In like manner , under the Copyright laws of the other states of
Europe	LOCATION	, the author possesses the absolute con - trol of his production , and is placed in a position to assign to his selling agents , the publishers , the same con - trol for such a territory as he may specify .

		In no other way , in fact , can the author secure for himself what the Copyright law proposes he shall secure -- namely , the fullest possible return for his labor .

		It is in order , also , to correct the statement made by the Librarians on another matter , their reference to which can only be described as disingenuous .

		They refer to the published price of the American edition of the ''
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature '' as
$ 2.50	MONEY	per volume , and state that the English edition is issued per volume at 7s .

		6d .

		With the printed cata -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 logues before them , they must certainly have known that the pubUshed price per volume of the English edition is 9s. , and that the price of 7s .

		6d .

		is in force only for purchasers who place advance subscriptions for the entire set .

		They must also have known that while the published price per volume of the American issue is
$ 2.50	MONEY	, a proportionate reduction is given to subscrib - ers for the complete set .

		They were further aware , of course , that the Libraries secure a reduction from the published price .

		Their statement , however , is worded for the purpose of giving the impression that the Amer - ican price of the book is
$ 2.50	MONEY	as against an English price of 7s .

		6d .

		They also fail to point out that the American edition of this work is printed in a more open and therefore more expensive typography , and is bound in a more substantial and costly form .

		This disingenuous comparison of English and Amer - ican prices is , it seems to me , characteristic of the atti - tude taken by certain American Librarians in regard to American publishing undertakings which are of first importance for the literary interests of the community .

		I can but think that the
Library Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	might more accurately be entitled The League of -LRB- cer - tain -RRB- Librarians for the Undermining of Copyright .

		SOME NEEDED TYPOGRAPHICAL REFORMS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The academic move of a printers ' society toward ascertaining some practical methods by which type may be made more readable , noted in The Dial of
May 16	DATE	, is of a certain interest in itself , but more particu - larly because of that which it may suggest to those who have considered the legibility of the printed page from the point of view of all the elements concerned .

		While improvements in type-design may be possible , it is also doubtless true that ease and pleasure in reading may be greatly increased without altering the present type - faces .

		The matter of the design of those letters which are now deemed defective has engaged the study of the designers attached to the type foundries , and of those independent artists who occasionally make type faces , as well as the expert printers and critics of printing , for many years .

		The progressive founders are constantly experimenting with designs that are offered to overcome the objections to some of the Roman letters , and large sums of money are annually expended in perfecting these suggested designs , cutting matrices , and getting expert opinions .

		There is never a time when there are not from one to a dozen of these experimental fonts of type , in some stage of making , on the desk of the enter - prising foundry manager , out of which there comes no more than one per cent of possibilities .

		Some of the letters mentioned by you have been the objects of con - tinuous study during many years past , as the a , the e , the I , the s , the o , and others .

		By the way , the dot over the i is on a level with the letter I , in all ordinary fonts of reading type , as in the note you print ; but this same dot is a worry to designers , and is often misplaced , be - cause its proper optical location is ignored in favor of puttmg it in perfect draftsmanship relations with the other parts of the letter .

		The scientists will find it difficult to add to the knowledge of the type-designers , though the designers will welcome the investigation suggested .

		It should be noted that the setting of type by machin - ery , and especially the processes by which it is manu - factured as it is set , have seriously injured type designs , chiefly because of the abolishment of overhanging kerns and the unnecessary disregard of the '' set '' of the letters ; the one inevitable , and the other the result of carelessness or ignorance .

		The flowing lines of the handsome letters of the time before the machines came in are missing , and m their place we have an abbreviated and prim uprightness of certain letters that takes much from the beauty of the type .

		There is something now being done in the direction of remedying the objectionable optical qualities of the ordinary types used for book printing , by some of the better printers .

		The most notable example of this pro- gressive work that has appeared in
America	LOCATION	is the '' Geofroy Tory '' just from the skilful hands of Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	.

		-LSB- This work is spoken of at some length in another part of this issue of The Dial .

		--
Edr	ORGANIZATION	. -RSB-

		The type upon which this beautiful book is printed has been re-designed by Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	, who took the ordinary
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- lon for his base and has worked out a type which makes words that are optical units , rather than collections of letters .

		Many of the letters have been re-designed , and the '' set '' has been very carefully studied and adjusted .

		I very much doubt if any committee of learned pro- fessors could , through applying all the methods of cyco - logical research , produce or suggest a type better than this in the essentials that promote easy reading and eye - ease .

		But the effects produced by Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	are not possible in commercial book-making , unless we are to return to hand-set type ; and it is difficult to understand why this is not more commonly done , since there is no economy in machine-set type for good books made by the good printers , and there is a very great advantage possible if hand-set type is intelligently used .

		But granting that type for the ordinary books is certain to be machine-set , the book page may easily be made so much more closely in accord with the necessities of the eyes that it will appear to be the product of the very reform for which this society of printers is appeal - ing .

		The optical qualities necessary for comfoi-table reading , and the conservation of the powers of the eyes , do not largely depend upon the design of the type , but upon the method of the use of the type , the length of the lines , the proportions of the type-page , the margins , the tone of the print , and the general arrangement of the book .

		The paper , and all of the processes of printing , have also their influence upon the eyes .

		If all of these considerations are given due attention by the skilled printer , there will be little complaint of the design of the type face .

		If in addition the printer would use some of the faces of type which were more or less in vogue before the machines came in -- like the
Riverside	LOCATION	faces for a modern Roman , or the original
Caslon	PERSON	for an old-style Roman -- there would also be handsome book pages , which would be nearly exempt from criticism , and we should hear less about the necessity of making over our letters .

		And if they are made over , it is reasonably certain that the recommended forms will not run on the machines ; and the state of our eyes then would be the very same as now .

		What book-making needs is knowledge of how to use the type faces we have , with the machines , rather than an attempt to force a reform that is foredoomed to failure .

		CoxcoRD Memories , and Other Pages FROM THE Past .

		* Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, the last of the famous company that has made
Concord	LOCATION	illustrious in the world of intellect and ideals , speaks of himself as belonging now '' to a small and fast-dwindling band of men and women who , fifty , sixty and seventy years ago , resolved that other persons ought to be as free as ourselves . ''

		Of this liberty-loving band
John Brown	PERSON	is naturally named as the leader and hero ; and to
John Brown	PERSON	and his labors and sacrifices in the cause of negro emancipation much of the first of Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's two volumes of '' Recollections of Seventy Years '' is devoted , while the second volume is filled chiefly with intimate reminis - cences of those
Concord	LOCATION	celebrities about whom we are never tired of hearing .

		In one import - ant respect the author has failed to write up to his title : he has come to a halt at the end of his first forty years , with but little reference to later incidents , leaving the reader to hope that the remaining thirty -LRB- or , more accurately , thirty - eight -RRB- years may furnish motive and material for subsequent volumes .

		In reviewing Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's book , one can not do better than follow his own example in such work .

		As editor of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Common - wealth '' forty-six years ago , and later one of the editorial staff of the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican , '' to which journal he still contributes a weekly ''
Boston	LOCATION	Literary Letter , '' he has written innumerable book-notices ; and in these he has adopted a practice , which he commends , of treat - ing the reader to ample quotations , '' when space and time will allow . ''

		For he well recalls , he tells us , the keen pleasure he himself found as a young man in such quoted passages , while the criticism passed unheeded by .

		First , then , a word from his own pen concerning his early education .

		Like many of the best-educated men , he was largely self-taught .

		Speaking of the house where he was born in
1831	DATE	, at Hamp - ton Falls ,
N. H.	PERSON	, and of the large room '' where in winter we dined , and where I studied Latin , French , Greek , and German , before I ever thought of going to
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, '' he continues : '' The facilities for so many languages were furnished by what remained of the church library ' for the use of the ministry , ' given by Dr.
Langdon	PERSON	, the parish clergy - • Recollections of Seventy Years .

		By
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	of
Concord	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Richard G. Badger	PERSON	.

		man , a retired president of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	; and by the text - books which my brother
Charles	PERSON	bought for his own studies ... Dr.
Langdon	PERSON	and
Parson Abbot	PERSON	, his suc - cessor , were the nearest neighbors of my ancestors from
1780	DATE	, when Dr.
Langdon	PERSON	indignantly withdrew from his insulted presidency , until
1827	DATE	, when Mr.
Abbot	PERSON	retired to his hill-farm in
Windham	LOCATION	, twenty miles inland .

		In this half-century -LRB- almost -RRB- the foundation of a reading and studious community was laid in my native township ; both these clergymen being learned scholars , fond of disseminating culture among their parishioners .

		Both founded local libraries -- Dr.
Langdon	PERSON	of Latin , Greek and historical folios , quartos , octavos , and pamphlets ; and Parson Abbot a < social ' lending library wholly in English , and more popular in its quality .

		Both were customarily kept in the Parsonage , and were open to me , a schoolmate of the sons of successive parsons , and their playmate on the little triangular common where the
Exeter	LOCATION	road ,
Hampton	PERSON	old-road and Kensington crossroad came together . ''

		Plutarch 's '' Lives , '' in
Langhorne	LOCATION	's trans - lation , the boy read before he was eight years old , and most of the other few hundred books in the Social Library , of which his father was a shareholder , had been gone through when , at the age of fourteen , he began on the weightier con - tents of the other library .

		Greek gi'ammar , indeed , he had already taken up three years earlier ; and when he resumed the study of the language , more vigorously , at fifteen , it was never to drop it again .

		Mr
Sanborn	PERSON	's friends can bear witness to his continued pursuit of Greek literature and his rare appreciation of its beauties .

		After Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's three years at
Harvard	LOCATION	, where he entered the sophomore class in
1852	DATE	, natural affinity and an opening in the teacher 's profession drew him to
Concord	LOCATION	.

		He begins this chapter of his life with some significant remarks on the literary inspiration of the town as compared with that of
Cambridge	LOCATION	in his col - lege days , and confesses himself more indebted to
Concord	LOCATION	than to
Cambridge	LOCATION	for his training . ''

		With all respect for
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, as it was when I was matriculated a student there in
1852	DATE	, it must be said that I owed more to several other persons than to any of the college Faculty , and more to
Emer	PERSON	- son and
Theodore Parker	PERSON	than to all the professors and tutors together .

		Yet the undergraduate or academic department , though containing less than 400 students , was , in my deliberate judgment , as well equipped then for producing the results of high scholarship , general culture , and practical efficiency in the tasks of American life , as it is to-day , with its thousands of students , millions of endowment , and ten instructors where there were but two in my college days .

		The professional schools are greatly improved , the post-graduate facil - ities are multiplied by ten or more , the football , base - ball , boat-racing and theatrical departments are far more active , productive and expensive ; but the homely , solitary , fraternal and personal influences of the small college are mostly things of the past .

		In all its history , and with all its advantages ,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has usually lagged
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 in the rear of the highest culture ; it does so still , amid the wealth of its foundations and the multiplicity of its opportunities . ''

		No account of Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's book would be complete without some reference to his intimate connection with and unstinted admiration for the champion of a free
Kansas	LOCATION	and the hero and martyr of
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry .

		Though only for a few years associated in a common cause with
John Brown	PERSON	, he declares himself better acquainted with him than with many men whom he has known a lifetime .

		Hence a few lines of characterization from his pen will here be well worth while .

		``
John Brown	PERSON	, though born in
New England	LOCATION	, and strongly marked with the
New England	ORGANIZATION	seriousness of mood , had spent most of his half-century in new and wild regions , intimate with nature , and directing other men rather than guided or trained by them .

		He was profound in his thinking , and had formed his opinions rather by observation than by reading , though well versed in a few books , chief among which was the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		He was , in truth , a Calvinist Puritan , born a century or two after the fashion had changed ; but as ready as those of
Bradford	ORGANIZATION	's or
Cromwell	PERSON	's time had been to engage in any work of the Lord to which he felt himself called . ''

		Acting as secretary of the
Massachusetts Kansas Committee	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	travelled ex - tensively in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, which was then the Far West , and he has given in detail a first - hand account of the tempestuous beginnings of the
Kansas	LOCATION	commonwealth .

		The trouble that he became involved in with the powers at
Washington	LOCATION	, his attempted arrest , and his flight to
Canada	LOCATION	and other expedients to preserve his freedom and to avoid implicating his associates , are fully related in his first volume .

		The hing - ing of one momentous event on another in the author 's life is strikingly shown at several points .

		For instance , the legal aid and advice which
John A. Andrew	PERSON	gave to his
Concord	LOCATION	friend when the latter was in some apprehension of serious trouble from
Washington	LOCATION	led to Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's helping to nominate
Andrew	PERSON	for gov - ernor ; and
Andrew	PERSON	's election and repeated re-election enabled him to offer the secretaryship of the newly created
Board of State Charities	ORGANIZATION	to the ex-secretary of the
Kansas Committee	ORGANIZATION	, an office that Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	accepted and in which he rendered notable service , although this de - partment of his varied activities receives no further mention in the present volumes .

		A brief reference to Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's manner of passing the time during his enforced absence from home is illuminating .

		With enough of uncertainty and unpleasantness in his situation to make many a man walk the streets or smoke unnumbered cigars , or perhaps seek spirituous rather than spiritual solace , the exile formed the acquaintance of a young priest at the
Jesuit College	ORGANIZATION	in
Quebec	LOCATION	and spent hours reading in the library of which the priest was custodian , making there , as he tells us , '' the reading acquaintance of
Lucan	PERSON	's '
Pharsalia	PERSON	' and the quaint biographies of
Izaak Walton	PERSON	and Mrs. Colonel
Hutchinson	PERSON	. ''

		In the pages of the second volume ,
Emerson	PERSON	and
Thoreau	PERSON	and EUery Channing -LRB- the poet -RRB- figure most conspicuously .

		Correcting a false impression concerning
Emerson	PERSON	as a church - goer after he ceased to be a minister , Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	writes : '' I saw in the reported address of President Eliot at the
Boston Centenary of Emerson	ORGANIZATION	, a singular statement : '
Emerson	PERSON	attended church on
Sundays	DATE	all his life with uncommon regularity . '

		A regularity which kept him away from the
Sunday	DATE	services ten years at a time would certainly be called ' uncommon , ' and such was his habit during the first twenty years that I knew him , from
1853	DATE	to
1873	DATE	.

		I had reason to know his practice , for a considerable part of that time I often sat in Mrs.
Emerson	PERSON	's pew , or , if not , at a point where I saw all its occupants ; and though I may once or twice have seen
Emerson	PERSON	in it , the occasions must have been very few .

		He afterward took up , in old age , the practice of his earlier life , and sat there with his wife and daughter , but for many years he was only seen at church rarely . ''

		We are apt to think of the
Concord	LOCATION	worthies of fifty years ago as wearing halos or laurel crowns , or at least as walking in a sort of glorified nimbus , in the view of their less exalted fellow - townsmen .

		But this now appears not to have been the case , if we may credit the following : '' It is a singular fact , on which I have much medi - tated , that in
Concord	LOCATION	, for most of the years that the great coterie of authors who now reflect credit on the little town , were living there and associating with one another , the general community had small regard for any of them except
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		His claims were more intelligible to the ordinary citizen than those of
Alcott	LOCATION	, or
Thoreau	LOCATION	, or
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, or Channing .

		All these four , when I first lived in
Concord	LOCATION	, were regarded as oddities , and as more or less reprehensible in their eccentricity .

		Alcott 's poverty ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	's unpopular politics ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's unsparing criticism , and
Channing	PERSON	's caprice increased the dislike which was felt by the fancied leaders of the community .

		It is true they had peculiarities that might excuse the disregard felt for them by those who had not insight enough for their higher traits ; but the men and women of education should have perceived , as a few of them did , the real eminence of the four , each in his own way . ''

		A rapid sketch of the sturdy
Thoreau	PERSON	must here find room for insertion .

		What a contrast between his temperament and opinions and those of the late lamented
John Davidson	PERSON	, for example ! ''

		How did
Thoreau	PERSON	bear himself in the hourly give - and-take of our village life ?

		To what daily habits did his philosophy lead him ?

		In the first place , he was scrupulously honest and diligent -- no citizen in the 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, plainest way of life was more industrious , or less dis - posed to avoid his chosen duties .

		He even preferred to support himself for years by manual labor , because he thought this form of industry left him more leisure for thought , which , with him , was the real business of life .

		Writing to
Horace Greeley	PERSON	in
May , 1848	DATE	, he said that for five years past he had lived by the labor of his hands , not getting a cent from any other quarter .

		In this work , he estimated , only a month in each year had been used ; the rest of the time he had for his own occupations and studies , and he thought few men of letters had so much leisure .

		He even railed at those scholars who complain that their fate is hard because they get little money , -- who depend on patrons and starve in garrets , or at last go mad and die .

		Why should not the scholar , he said , if he is really wiser than the multitude , do rude work now and then ?

		To such work
Thoreau	PERSON	had been brought up , and he hardly ceased from it , so long as his physical strength lasted . ''

		In a letter written in
1850	DATE	by the young woman who afterward became Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's first wife , there occurs this sentence concerning ''
F. S.	PERSON	, the young poet , '' whom the writer had just met for the first time : '' There was a charm about everything he said * , because he has thought more wholly for himself than anyone I ever met . ''

		This known independence of Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's in matters of opinion , marks his book from begin - ning to end .

		There is nothing of second-hand or imitation in it ; and this strong character of the work , with its flavor of
Concord	LOCATION	idealism and transcendentalism , constitutes its charm .

		It is a noteworthy piece of autobiography , and we hope it will be continued and completed .

		The many portraits and other illustrations deserve , too , a word of commendation , as does also the full index at the end .

		Chapters of
American Opera	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, the veteran dramatic critic of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' has recently given the public his reminiscences of the Amer - ican dramatic stage during the past fifty years .

		Following closely in his footsteps , Mr.
Henry E. Krehbiel	PERSON	, musical critic of the same paper for thirty years , has given the public his reminis - cences of opera in
New York	LOCATION	, beginning with the earliest local history of the lyric drama and coming down to the present time .

		The work mainly has reference to
New York City	LOCATION	; but as any review of operatic history there includes in large degree operatic history in all our large cities , Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	's book '' Chapters of Opera '' * Chapters of Opera .

		Being Historical and Critical Obser - vations and Records Concerning the Lyric Drama in
New York	LOCATION	, from its earliest days down to the present time .

		By
Henry Edward Krehbiel	PERSON	.

		With over seventy illustrations .

		New York :
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		has a widespread interest and should appeal to the general public .

		In limiting his work to opera , Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	has wisely discriminated .

		He might have covered a wider area of subject ; for , as a musician , musical critic , and musical writer , he has been closely in touch all these years with musical undertakings of every kind .

		Perhaps he recognized that while
New York City	LOCATION	is an operatic centre it is not strictly a musical centre .

		Other cities do not look to it for anything but operatic supply .

		Until that city has a permanent orchestra in its own home , permanently organized , conducted , housed , and pensioned , worthy to rank in the same class with the
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	or
Boston Symphony	ORGANIZATION	organizations , it can hardly lay claim to being the musical centre of the country .

		At present it has only its
Philharmonic Society	ORGANIZATION	, with a three years ' permanency under the leadership of the excellent
Mahler	ORGANIZATION	, and guaranteed that length of time only through the persevering efforts of one lady .


New York	LOCATION	has never cared much for the orchestra which is the essential basis of all musical success .

		It does , however , care very much for opera , because it is the centre of wealth and fashion , and opera depends for its success mainly upon these factors .

		Whatever may have been his motive , Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	has chosen the lyric drama for his subject , and he has given the public the most complete history of it which has yet been writ - ten , beginning with the introduction of Italian opera by the Garcias , of English opera by
Malibran	PERSON	, and of the ballad operas , of which '' The Beggars ' Opera '' is a conspicuous exam - ple , and closing with the season of
1908	DATE	in the
Metropolitan Opera House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , the author 's personal acquaintance with operatic history is largely confined to the artists , managers , and repertories of that house .

		As in every book which Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	has given the public , he writes with knowledge and authority .

		He has had a wide acquaintance with artists , has enjoyed the confidence of man - agers , and has had ample official resources to draw upon ; so that on the one hand he has pre - sented a trustworthy narrative , and on the other has embellished it with intelligent criticism and pleasant reminiscence .

		Any history of this kind must have its dry spots ; but he amply com - pensates for them by the personal note always pleasantly sounded , and by a quiet humor which illuminates many a page of his text .

		Thus he has made a book which is not only a valuable and interesting compendium , but delightful to read .

		Mr
Krehbiel	PERSON	's style is usually dignified

		THE DIAL 399 and earnest , as of one having authority ; but in the '' Chapters of Opera '' he frequently unbends and descends from the critical '' • Tribune '' to gossip pleasantly and chat with his readers .

		In a word , Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	has given us an authoritative , exact , and comprehensive history of opera in
New York	LOCATION	, which means a history of opera in this country .

		It is quite profusely illustrated with cuts of the earlier opera houses and artists and reproductions of excellent pho - graphs of artists still upon the stage .


George P. Upton	PERSON	.

		Shelley the `` Enchanted Child . ''

		* On the death of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, in
Novem	DATE	- ber of
1907	DATE	, the world recognized that it had lost a poet great and unusual as to quality , though of scant production as to quantity .

		That Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	was also a charming prose-writer was little known and scarcely mentioned .

		To add this to his preceding honors is left for us , the readers of his essay on SheUey , first pub - lished last fall in the ''
Dublin	LOCATION	Review , '' and now issued separately as a small volume , with an Introduction by the Right Honorable
George Wyndham	PERSON	.

		The manuscript of this essay was found among the poet 's papers after his death .

		It had been written nearly twenty years before , but being rejected by the editor of the ''
Dublin	LOCATION	Review '' was thrown aside by its discouraged author to lie until found by his literary executor after his death .

		A lapse of twenty years having brought about a change of editors to the magazine as well as fame to Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	, the review for which it was originally intended was only too glad to print it ; to this editor , and to Mr.
Wilfrid MeyneU	PERSON	, Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's literary executor , are we indebted for the recovery from oblivion of a manuscript worthy a place among English prose masterpieces .

		From this point of view -- as a brilliant , picturesque , glowing tribute from one poet to another and greater one to whom he was not a little akin in spirit -- praise of the essay can hardly be too great .

		The reviewer need do little more than present copious extracts in proof .

		But if it is to be regarded as an addition to
Shelley	PERSON	- criticism , if
Thompson	ORGANIZATION	is to be entered in the list of leading
Shelley	PERSON	critics with
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	,
Garnett	PERSON	,
Forman	PERSON	,
Symonds	PERSON	, and others , then the essay must take much lower rank , must *
Shelley	PERSON	.

		By
Francis Thompson	PERSON	.

		Scribner 's Sons .

		New York : Charles be recognized , in fact , as scarcely more than superficial .

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's introductory assertion , that in the present day
Shelley	PERSON	has no lineal descend - ant in the poetical order , is one not likely to be gainsaid ; nor , according to his prediction , are we likely to have one , since a poet abound - ingly spontaneous , like
Shelley	PERSON	, could hardly flourish in a self-conscious age like our own .

		An age that is ceasing to produce child-like children can not produce a
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		For , both as man and as poet , he was essentially a child -- a word defined by Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	in the follow - ing glowing fashion : '' Know you what is to be a child ?

		It is to be some - thing very different from the man of to-day .

		It is to have a spirit jet streaming from the waters of baptism ; it is to believe in love , to believe in loveliness , to believe in belief ; it is to be so little that the elves can reach to whisper in your ear ; it is to turn pumpkins into coaches , and mice into horses , lowness into loftiness , and nothing into everything , for each child has its fairy godmother in its own soul ; it is to live in a nutshell and to count yourself the king of infinite space ; it is To see a world in a grain of sand , And a heaven in a wild flower , Hold infinity in the palm of your hand , And eternity in an hour ; it is to know not as yet that you are under sentence of life , nor petition that it be commuted into death ... J!o the last , in a degree uncommon among poets ,
Shelley	PERSON	retained the idiosyncrasy of childhood , expanded and matured without differentiation .

		To the last he was the enchanted child . ''

		This doctrine of the '' enchanted child '' ap - plied to
Shelley	PERSON	is the main thesis of the essay , the one which Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	continually reiter - ates and to which he returns at every point .

		Not only was
Shelley	PERSON	child-like by nature , but this disposition was fostered by his early and long isolation among his fellows .

		The persecution which overclouded his school-days is hardly ex - aggerated in the picture given in '' The Revolt of Islam . ''

		Escaping bodily violence for the most part , he was the victim of the most ter - rible weapon that boys have against their fellow - boy , who is powerless to shun it because , unlike the man , he has virtually no privacy .

		He was a little St.
Sebastian	PERSON	, sinking under the inces - sant flight of shafts which skilfully avoid the vital parts .

		The '' magnified child '' is again shown in his fondness for apparently futile amusements , such as the sailing of paper-boats .

		This was not childish , not a mindless triviality , though it was child-like ; it showed the genuine child 's power of investing little things with imaginative interest .

		Even as a philosopher ,
Shelley	PERSON	was a child , '' firmly expecting spiritual rest from each new 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, divinity , though it had found none from the divinities antecedent . ''

		The reserve and deli - cacy with which Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	disposes of this stumbling-block in the path of many of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's devotees are admirable , his conclusion being that certain episodes in
Shelley	LOCATION	's life were due to '' no mere straying of the sensual appetite , but a straying , strange and deplorable , of the spirit '' ; that '' he left a woman not because he was tired of her arms , but because he was tired of her soul . ''

		And he pays this beautiful tribute to
Mary Shelley	PERSON	: '' Few poets were so mated be - fore , and no poet was so mated afterwards until
Browning	PERSON	stooped and picked up a fair-coined soul that lay rusting in a pool of tears . ''

		Child-like also , because so irrational , was
Shelley	PERSON	's unhappiness and discontent with life .

		The pity due to his outward circumstances has been strangely exaggerated .

		Poverty never dictated to his pen ; the designs on his bright imagination were never etched by the sharp fumes of necessity ; as compared with
Keats	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and De
Quincey	PERSON	, his was a highly .

		favored lot .

		Coming to
Shelley	PERSON	's poetry , we peep over the wild mask of revolutionary metaphysics and again we see the winsome face of the child . ''

		The Cloud , '' most typically Shelleyan of all the poems , is '' the child 's faculty of make - believe raised to the nth power . ''

		He is still at play , save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch , and his playthings are those which the gods give their children .

		The universe is his box of toys .

		He dabbles his fingers in the day-fall .

		He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars .

		He makes bright mischief with the moon .

		The meteors nuzzle their noses in his hand .

		He teases into growl - ing the kennelled thunder , and laughs at the shaking of its fiery chain .

		He dances in and out of the gates of heaven ; its floor is littered with his broken fancies .

		He runs wild over the fields of ether .

		He chases the roll - ing world .

		He gets between the feet of the horses of the sun .

		He stands in the lap of patient Nature , and twines her loosened tresses after a hundred wilful fashions , to see how she will look nicest in his song . ''

		It was
Shelley	PERSON	's childlike quality that assim - ilated him to the childlike peoples among whom mythologies have their rise .

		This made him in the truest sense a mythological poet , as in '' Prometheus Unbound '' -- a veritable poet of nature , but not in the Wordsworthian sense .

		He delighted in imagery , not merely as a means of expression nor even as adornment , but in imagery for its own sake .

		Shelley is what the Meta - physical School of poetry tried to be . ''

		The Metaphysical School failed , not because it toyed with imagery , but because it toyed with it frostily .

		To sport with the tangles of
Nesera	ORGANIZATION	's hair may be trivial idleness or caressing tenderness , exactly as your relation to
Neaera	ORGANIZATION	is that of heartless gallantry or of love .

		So you may toy with imagery in mere intellectual ingenuity , and then you might as well go write acrostics ; or you may toy with it in raptures and then you may write a ' Sensitive Plant . '

		In fact , the Metaphysical poets when they went astray can not be said to have done anything so dainty as is implied by toying with imagery .

		They cut it into shapes with a pair of scissors .

		From all such danger
Shelley	PERSON	was saved by his passionate spontaneity ; no trappings are too splendid for the swift steeds of sun - rise .

		His sword-hilt may be rough with jewels , but it is the hilt of an Excalibur .

		His thoughts scorch through all the folds of expression .

		His cloth of gold bursts at the flexures , and shows the naked poetry . ''

		In estimating individual poems , Mr.Thompson calls the '' Prometheus Unbound '' the '' most comprehensive storehouse of
Shelley	PERSON	's power '' ; '' Adonais '' '' the most perfect of his longer efforts '' ; the lyrics and shorter poems the most '' absolute virgin-gold of song . ''

		In conclusion , Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	asks the oft - propounded question why it is that the poets most '' skyey '' in grain have ever the saddest lives . ''

		Is it that -LRB- by some subtile mystery of analogy -RRB- sor - row , passion and fantasy are indissolubly connected , like water , fire and cloud ; that as from sun and dew are born the vapours , so from fire and tears ascend the ' visions of aerial joy ' ; that the harvest waves richest over the battlefields of the soul ; that the heart , like the earth , smells sweetest after rain ; that the spell on which depend such necromantic castles is some spirit of pain , charm - poisoned at their base ?

		... I ^ ess tragic in its merely temporal aspect than the life of
Keats	PERSON	or
Coleridge	PERSON	, the life of Shelley in its moral aspect is , perhaps , more tragical than that of either ; his dying seems a myth , a figure of his living ; the material shipwreck a figure of the immaterial .

		`` Enchanted child , born into a world unchildlike ; spoiled darling of Nature , playmate of her elemental daughters ; ' pard-like spirit , beautiful and swift , ' laired amidst the burning fastnesses of his own fervid mind ; bold foot along the verges of precipitous dream ; light leaper from crag to crag of inaccessible fancies ; tower - ing Genius , whose soul rose like a ladder between heaven and earth with the angels of song ascending and de - scending it ; -- he is shrunken into the little vessel of death , and sealed with the unshatterable seal of doom , and cast down deep below the rolling tides of
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mighty meat for little guests , when the heart of
Shelley	PERSON	was laid in the cemetery of Caius Cestius !

		Beauty , music , sweetness , tears -- the mouth of the worm has fed them all .

		Into that sacred bridal-gloom of death where he holds his nuptials with eternity let not our rash speculations follow him . ''

		One lays down the little volume , stirred and thrilled by the magic of words and images not unlike
Shelley	PERSON	's own .

		But when emotion has cooled , the conviction arises and persists that at bottom Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's interpretation is lacking in real comprehension of the most essen - tial parts of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's nature .

		The '' enchanted child '' theory is pretty , and true as far as it
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401 goes , but it is too limited to satisfy those who have known and loved
Shelley	PERSON	throughout a life - time .

		Two things in
Shelley	LOCATION	were as deep in him as his poetry : his passion for reforming the world , and his essential faith in spiritual things .

		Both of these , Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	either ignores or implicitly denies .

		Almost from his birth ,
Shelley	PERSON	's chief characteristics were those of a reformer .

		As a schoolboy at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	, it was shown by his resistance of the atrocious fagging system then in full force ; at
Oxford	LOCATION	, it appeared in the form of intellectual revolt against church dogma , causing his expulsion at the age of eighteen ; in the political field it manifested itself in his papers on Catholic Emancipation ; returning from his Irish campaign , he struck out bravely for free thought and free speech by attacking Lord Ellenborough , and then wrote '' Queen Mab '' embodying his knight-errant spirit in verse .

		Especially does it seem inadequate to consider '' Prometheus Unbound '' mainly as a mytholog - ical poem .

		That its real subject is the redemp - tion of humanity , personified in the character of Prometheus -- a redemption accomplished not only through the uprooting of evil , but through the active force of good -- is something which seems to have been unsuspected by Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	.

		Another implication of the essay that can not pass without protest is that
Shelley	PERSON	was lacking in religious faith .

		We shall have to grant that in
Shelley	LOCATION	's early writing there are passages that seem to justify such an implication , especially a notable one in '' Queen Mab '' -LRB- Part VI . -RRB-

		, in which he calls Religion to account for being the guilty cause of all the evils in the world .

		But read the passage carefully and you discover that when he says Religion he really means Dogma .

		And even if the passage were much more damaging than it is , we shoidd still say that it is unfair to lay too much stress on the utterance of a boy of eighteen .

		It is like dwelling upon
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's boyish pranks , such as poaching and deer-stealing , and omitting to call attention to '' Hamlet '' or ''
Lear	PERSON	. ''

		We judge a man by his man 's work , not by his boy efforts .

		Shelley never published '' Queen Mab '' by his own wish ; he printed privately 250 copies , distributing them among his friends .

		After leaving En - gland , when he heard it was to be published he wrote back and tried to stop it , saying he had forgotten what it was but had no doubt it was '' villainous trash . ''

		If we want really to get at
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's ideas of the Unknowable we must take his maturer work : `` Prometheus , '' `` Adonais , '' `` The Boat on the Serchio , '' `` Hellas . ''

		What
Shelley	PERSON	's views were the year before his death we may get in two lines of '' The Boat on the Serchio : '' '' All rose to do the task He set to each , Who shaped us to His end and not our own , '' Throughout the whole of his mature work there is unassailable evidence that he believed in the existence of a God .

		Even as early as ''
Laon	LOCATION	and Cythna , '' he says in the '' Preface '' : '' The erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a
Supreme Being	ORGANIZATION	is spoken against , but not
the Supreme Being	ORGANIZATION	itself . ''

		Just as Religion is above all creeds , dogmas , and theol - ogies whatsoever , so was
Shelley	PERSON	's faith above those articles and doctrines that many accept in place of Religion .

		Shelley believed in the Eternal Goodness , in the Eternal Truth , and in the Eternal Love .

		In his essay '' On Life '' he says : '' What is Love ?

		Ask him who lives .

		What is Life ?

		Ask him who adores , What is God ? ''

		For these reasons it must be said that this book about
Shelley	PERSON	fails to take the same high place in criticism that it takes in mastery of English prose .

		Perchance Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's attitude as a Roman Catholic writing for a Roman Catholic publication kept him from recognizing what has been so explicitly expressed by an English clergyman -LRB-
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	-RRB- : '' There are more clergymen and more religious laymen than we imagine who trace to the emo - tion awakened in them when they were young , their wider and better views of God . ''

		Without such recognition of
Shelley	PERSON	's spiritual message to his generation and to our own , no criticism of him can be considered as really adequate .

		402 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, proportional relations should be harmonic , and others not , is a question that has never been satisfactorily answered , though from times of remote antiquity it has been the subject of philo - sophic inquiry .

		Efforts to reduce the matter to a mathematical formula , whether expressed in terms of numerical ratios of the Pythagorean scale , or based upon the division of quantities by the so-called golden section , or upon the theory of musical chords , or of the consonance of notes sounded in sequence , can not be regarded as entirely satisfactory .

		Nevertheless the sensi - tive eye recognizes a more subtle harmony in some proportions than in others .

		The page of the volume before us is of a size -- imperial octavo -- that has had the approval of many generations of book-lovers .

		Not only are its proportions pleasant to contemplate , but so also are those of the type-page , which is designed and placed in accord with the requirements of the most exact - ing taste , the margins -- a most important feature in a well-printed book -- progressively increas - ing from back to head , fore-edge , and tail , the outer margin being twice the width of the inner , the lower somewhat more than twice that of the upper .

		Moreover , the diagonal of the type-page coincides with that of the paper from the back at the top to the fore-edge at the bottom ; a refine - ment that means much more than is commonly apprehended , and is significant of the pains bestowed upon every detail of the volume .

		Typographically , the book is of unusual dis - tinction .

		It is printed upon English hand-made paper of fine quality and agreeable texture , upon which both the letter-press and the illustrations appear to the best advantage .

		The press-work leaves nothing to be desired .

		The register is perfect , the impression uniform throughout , the color everywhere even and f lUl-toned .

		The type , a revised
Caslon	PERSON	designed by Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	and used for the first time in this work , is of exceptional beauty .

		By reintroducing some of the slight irregularities of the Renaissance types of the sixteenth century , the smug mechanical appearance of most modern faces has been suc - cessfully avoided without sacrifice of legibility .

		This is no small accomplishment .

		Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	is to be congratulated upon having worked out a type of pronounced character , strong in its effect when seen as a page , yet free from un - pleasant innovations and bizarre features save only the diagonal hyphen .

		This should be replaced in the font by one of different design .

		It is open to the objections that by carrying the eye off at an angle it interferes with easy read - ing , and that it is over-emphasized and conse - quently disturbing , especially when used at the end of a line .

		A word needs to be said for the admirable paragraphing and general typographical ar - rangement , and in particular for the even spacing .

		This may seem a small matter to the uninitiated , but it is in such things that the difference between ordinary and first-rate work - manship lies ; and the amount of time , trouble , and thought necessary to secure the best resiUts are seldom appreciated by those who are without practical experience in the supervision of fine printing .

		The initiate , however , soon discovers that the largely enhanced cost of the better work is weU earned .

		Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's monograph , which has not heretofore appeared in an English translation , was published originally in
1857	DATE	, and was reis - sued in a revised and considerably enlarged form in
1865	DATE	.

		It is a monument of accurate scholar - ship and such minute and painstaking research as amply to justify Mr.
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	's statement that in its second edition it '' is one of the few books of which it can be said that they are so well done that no one has any excuse for going over the ground again . ''

		His desire that '' some French publisher would bring out a new edition worthily illustrated , for in
1865	DATE	the modern processes of illustration were not invented , '' finds substantial if not precisely literal fulfilment in the present volume .

		Tory 's illustrated books are so rare , and , with the exception of the '' Royal Alphabet ' which he designed for
Robert Estienne	PERSON	, his engravings have been so seldom reproduced , that his name is not well known outside the circle of those interested in the history of engraving and typog - raphy .

		Yet he occupies a distinguished place in that history , and was in his day a man highly respected and of marked influence in more than one direction .

		Born in
Bourges	LOCATION	about
1480	DATE	, of obscure middle-class parents , he managed in some way , probably by the aid of a patron , to study at
the University	ORGANIZATION	of his native town , and then , early in the sixteenth century , to journey to
Italy	LOCATION	to finish his education in
Rome	LOCATION	and
Bologna	LOCATION	.

		Returning to
France	LOCATION	about
1504	DATE	, he began his career by editing editions of the works of a number of Latin authors .

		Prob - ably through the influence of his friend
Philiberfc Babou	PERSON	, at that time valet de chambre to the king , he was appointed regent , otherwise pro- fessor of philosophy , at the
CoUege of Plessis	ORGANIZATION	.

		Later he filled similar chairs at the
CoUege Coqueret	ORGANIZATION	and the
College of Bourgogne	ORGANIZATION	.

		While thus engaged in teaching he set about learning
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 drawing and engraving , became deeply inter - ested in typography , and about
1516	DATE	gave up his professorship to make a second visit to
Italy	LOCATION	, this time to study classic and renaissance forms in preparation for what was to be his life work .

		For a time after his return to
Paris	LOCATION	, about
1518	DATE	, Tory seems to have earned his living by painting miniatures , but he soon devoted his entire attention to engraving on wood , at first working for
Simon de Colines	ORGANIZATION	and other printers .

		By
1525	DATE	he had become an engraver and book - seller on his own account .

		The next year he became a printer also ; and in
1531	DATE	he was appointed Printer Royal to Fran9ois I. , being the first incumbent of that office which he held until his death in
1533	DATE	.

		In this brief period Tory effected an almost complete revolution in design for book ornamentation , supplanting the mediaeval styles then in vogue by ornaments based upon the work of the artists of the Italian Renaissance .

		If to our eyes his decorative de - signs appear somewhat thin , dry , and common - place , it should be borne in mind that at the time he began to work the beautiful embellish - ments of the French Horae , printed in the
last quarter of the fifteenth century	DATE	, were things of the past , and that in their stead most book illustrations were of a sort chiefly of German inception , marked in general more by vigor than by refinement or true artistic feeling .

		To this decadent art Tory 's forms were in strong contrast .

		They were also well suited to their purpose and fitted excellently with the types then in use .

		There is reason to believe that he designed and engraved types as well as wood - cuts ; at least
M. Bernard	PERSON	makes out a strong case for that contention .

		Though Tory 's engravings found a place in most of the illus - trated books of any importance printed in
Paris	LOCATION	during the second , third , and fourth decades of the sixteenth century , his most celebrated works were the illustrations and borders designed and engraved by him for his '' Books of Hours . ''

		He is also famous as the author , illustrator , and publisher of a book entitled '' Champ Fleury , '' an essay on the Latin alphabet , which he issued in
1529	DATE	.

		The purpose of this curious work was threefold ; in it he advocated the use of Roman letters in place of Gothic , urged the superiority of the French language , and made several rec - ommendations for the reformation of its orthog - raphy , most of which -- as the use of the apostrophe in place of an elided letter , and of the cedilla to designate the soft c -- were gen - erally adopted .

		Fascinated by the theories of Diirer on the proportions of the human body , Tory included in this book a fantastic explanation of the derivation of the Latin letters from the goddess lo , claiming that they are all formed of I and O .

		This theory , rather than '' the number of points and turns of the compass that each one requires , '' was probably all that he held for '' his own , '' though
M. Bernard	PERSON	prefers to think otherwise .

		Certain it is that Tory was neither the inventor of the Latin letters nor the one who perfected their proportions .

		Nor does the honor belong to
Simon Haieneuve	PERSON	, the Mans architect whose delineation of them Tory extols .

		In Diirer 's '' Underweysung der Messung , '' published in Niiremberg in
1525	DATE	, the letters are given almost as in `` Champ Fleury , '' the chief differences being in the O , the axis of which the German master slants at an angle of 45 degrees , while Tory gives it only a slight inclination from the vertical ; the G , of which the finish is given a height about half-way between Diirers two variants ; and the K in which he follows
Diirer	ORGANIZATION	's second and less favored drawing .

		But Diirer ,
Sigismundi de Fantis	PERSON	, author of the '' Theorica et practica ... de modo Scribendi '' -LRB-
Venice	LOCATION	1514 -RRB- , and Fra
Luca Paciola	PERSON	, author of the '' Divina Proportione '' -LRB-
Venice	LOCATION	1509 ; the first printed book in which the alphabet is worked out geometrically -RRB- , also commented upon by Tory , were alike indebted to the Venetian master
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	.

		It speaks well for Tory 's perception of beauty of form that he should have followed Leonardo so closely .

		How faithfully he did this is shown by a manuscript analysis of the alphabet in the possession of Mr.
Coella L. Ricketts	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, done upon paper which is known to have been used only from
1477	DATE	to
1483	DATE	, and which is probably the handiwork of Leonardo himself .

		This manuscript , it may be said in passing , Mr.
Ricketts	PERSON	contemplates publishing in facsimile .

		The identification of Tory 's designs is not free from difficulty .

		Many known to be his are signed with the double cross of
Lorraine	LOCATION	; but as this was used upon engravings which were not published until some years after his death , considerable difference of opinion exists as to whether it may be regarded as the mark of Tory 's workshop or that of the school of design of which he was the originator .

		M.
Bernard	ORGANIZATION	holds to the former view , although he thinks most of the works so signed were from Tory 's own hand .

		However , in the elaborate icon - ography which forms more than half of his monograph , he gives a list of later engravings up - on which the cross appears .

		These he considers 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, as emanating from Tory 's shop , which was con - tinued after
1533	DATE	, at first by his widow , and later by
Olivier Mallard	PERSON	.

		But
M. Henri Bou	PERSON	- chot found the same signature used upon the engravings in '' L'Entree du Roi a
Paris	LOCATION	'' in
1549	DATE	, -- a book not mentioned by
M. Bernard	PERSON	, -- and quite properly says that it '' can not be taken as a posthumous work of Tory , for these engrav - ings had their origin at a particular date . ''

		Possibly bearing upon this question is another book not included in
M. Bernard	LOCATION	's list -- the '' Sapphicae Horae '' of Petrus Busseronus , pub - lished at
Lyons	ORGANIZATION	by Jac .

		Huguetan , in
1538	DATE	.

		This little volume , of which a copy , formerly in the collection of
M. Yemeniz	PERSON	, and later in that of Mr.
Henry Probasco	PERSON	, is now in the
Newberry Library of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, contains ten unsigned en - gravings , copied from Tory 's Hours of
1524	DATE	, but re-drawn to a different scale and changed in various particulars though retaining the general characteristics of Tory 's style .

		From these it would appear that Tory was both copied and imitated , a distinction that has always come to artists of originating force .

		Students would have welcomed a larger num - ber of reproductions of Tory 's designs than are given in the
Riverside	LOCATION	edition of
M. Bernard	ORGANIZATION	's book , amply as it is illustrated .

		They would have appreciated also a specimen of Tory 's type , shown in relation to the borders used by him .

		Something may be said both for and against the method of reproduction employed . ''

		The de - signs , '' we are told , '' were all re-drawn with the greatest care over photographs of the orig - inals , and from these drawings photo-engravings made , which were afterward perfected by hand when the forms were on the press . ''

		The result - ant gain in typographical effect is incontestable , and Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	's drawings are entitled to very high praise .

		Nevertheless , the captious critic might object that for purposes of study photo - engravings direct from the originals have certain advantages , and that re-drawing involves not merely '' minor divergences of line '' but also difference in quality .

		Lines and dots drawn with a pen , or with Chinese white applied with a brush upon a black ground , as in the case of the floriated initials so wonderfully reproduced by Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	, can never be quite the same as though made with a graver .

		On the other hand , mechanical reproduction of such engrav - ings as Tory 's carries with it almost inevitably the perpetuation of defects due to the poor press - work of the sixteenth-century printers .

		And for exhaustive study one should always seek out the originals , and not rely upon any reproductions however excellent they may be .

		The bibliophile will prefer Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	's crisp and sparkling renderings , and will linger caress - ingly over the pages of this beautiful volume , which is creditable in the highest degree to the author , the translator , the printer , and the pub - lisher .

		The
Individuality of Wai	ORGANIZATION	> t Whitman .

		* An interest deeper than usual accompanies the appearance of a new volume in the English Men of Letters Series -- the volume on
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, by
George R. Carpenter	PERSON	-- an inter - est colored by sorrowful regret as the announce - ment of its author 's death follows close upon the publication of the book .

		The loss to American scholarship in the death of this conscientious and broad-minded literary student is emphasized as one turns the pages of his admirable essay .

		The life of the poet is covered with a fine perception of illuminating details , the effect of which is a portraiture rather more distinct in outline than even that given us by Mr.
Perry	PERSON	in his valuable study of Whitman published three years ago .

		It leaves Whitman somehow a more tangible personality and a bigger man .

		This is perhaps the chief service of Professor Carpen - ter 's biography .

		It is with the individuality of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	that he is fundamentally con - cerned ; the interpretation of the message is sub - ordinate .

		The man was larger than the poet .

		Stress is therefore laid upon the peculiar influences of the
Long Island	LOCATION	environment on Whitman 's youth , sensitive and impressionable as it was ; upon his early love of solitude and his life-long habit of meditation ; his custom of reading in every chance interval -- as at the noon hour at the printing-office , '' generally prose , and invariably s6rious matter '' ; his even - ing excursions , his holidays alone on the sea - shore ; his preferred association with ferry-hands , stage-drivers , and car-men ; for all these experi - ences entered into him and contributed to the enrichment of his emotional and intellectual life .

		He was not a scholar nor a bookman . ''

		His pas - sion was for the outer world , the tangible world . '' ''

		He craved the knowledge of the whole ; he was possessed by the passion for humanity . ''

		An interesting comparison is thus made by the biographer : '' This world of the majority , on which ours is only tangential , and of which we are so ignorant , and par - ticularly the world of the city laborer ,

		THE DIAL 405 well , and he was the only American man of letters who was thoroughly familiar with it .

		To
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	and
Holmes	PERSON	it was terra incognita , for they had travelled little in their own country , and at home had never passed the social boundaries of their class .

		Emer - son had travelled much , but always as a philosopher , to a large degree unconscious of and unsympathetic with the life of the masses .

		Whittier alone had something of the same sympathy with the people of the under or basic world , though it was not well developed .

		He knew the
New England	LOCATION	country folk , but mainly as the country-bred journalist and politician would know them ; he would have dragged them after him into the upper world of enlightenment ; he could not have con - ceived of abandoning himself completely to their illit - eracy , to their crude religious feeling , or entire lack of it , to their preoccupation with the physical toil and physical joy of life . ''

		And so the biographer brings us to
Whitman	PERSON	's own expression of his purpose , -- `` A feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary or poetic form , and imcompromisingly , my own physical , emotional , moral , intellectual , and aesthetic Personality , in the midst of , and tallying , the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days , and of current
America	LOCATION	-- and to exploit that Personality , identified with place and date , in a far more candid and comprehen - sive sense than any hitherto poem or book . ''

		But
Whitman	PERSON	's democracy is not regarded by Professor
Carpenter	PERSON	as the final essential fea - ture in his interpretation .

		His '' crowning charac - teristic was that his poetry of democracy sprang , not from well-defined intellectual concepts , but from an extraordinary mood , from an intense and peculiar emotion . ''

		With all his commonness and practicality .

		Whitman was a mystic .

		The chapters on '' Comradeship '' and '' Old Age '' are naturally full of interesting material -- nothing that is essentially new , but sympathetic and vivid to the end .

		The tone of the narrative is brighter and more mellow than that of some that we have read .

		In
1885	DATE	, the ever-generous circle of Whitman 's Camden friends planned a fund to buy '' the good gray poet '' an easy - riding buggy and a good horse .

		With the assist - ance of the older men of letters throughout the country , the gift was made . ''

		Thenceforward he drove regularly and frequently -- and , it must be added , often at a speed somewhat un - becoming his years , having exchanged the safe beast presented to him for one of a livelier gait . ''

		Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	has given us a genuine biog - raphy , a thoroughly readable and vivacious life of one of the most picturesque in the group of our American writers , and one whose signifi - cance in the history of American literature is more and more clearly recognized with the pass - ing years .

		Briefs on New Books .

		During the present Exposition year ^ ' ^ SS : ^ ' P '' ^ li `` attention is likely to be drawn largely toward the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and the history of the making of the states in that region will be studied with unusual interest .

		A timely volume on '' The History of the State of Washing - ton '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- appears from the pen of Professor
Edmond S. Meany	PERSON	of
the University of Washington	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is a distinct advance on the usual state history , being well-balanced , well-written , and well - printed .

		The first period treated is that of Dis - covery , which extends from prehistoric times to the visits of the ''
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, '' the '' Lady
Washington	LOCATION	, '' and the ''
Boston	LOCATION	, '' to the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	coast .

		An interesting reminder of the fate of the latter vessel , the massacre of most of her crew and the enslave - ment of the remainder , was noticed by the author during a personal visit to the Chinook Indians , who still use the term '' Boston-Man '' as a synonym for '' American . ''

		The period of Exploration covers the Astor project and the long contest with
England	LOCATION	for the fur-trade and the possession of the territory .

		The author considers the
United States	LOCATION	extremely fortunate in securing the land to the north of the
Columbia River	LOCATION	.

		The claim as far north as 54 ° 40 ' he pronounces a '' piece of pure Yankee bluster . ''

		The history of territorial days is made up largely of Indian wars and the influx of people after the dis - covery of gold on the
Pacific	LOCATION	slope .

		The early period of statehood is described as marked by an extravagance of public expenditure , which was , how - ever , corrected imder later administrations .

		The last chapter is the most novel in the volume , being a description of the results of Federal activity in the state in the shape of surveys , postal and customs service , judiciary , irrigation , etc. .

		The book as a whole is deserving a permanent place in the history of the states of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Points for ' ^ ^ ^ librarian 's painful particularity , workerg in or painstaking particularity , as he the library .

		niight prefer to express it , is not the least of those peculiar attributes that combine to make him the useful and talented and accurately informed person we all know him to be .

		Vagueness and practical library efficiency do not go together .

		That a librarian 's duties tend to develop pedantry and f ussiness and a disposition to magnify trifles -- to lose sight of wholes in the multiplicity of their parts , to let the spirit perish while the letter exu - berates -- is one of those things that can not very well be helped .

		Like writer 's cramp and clergyman 's sore throat , this tendency is one of the penalties , or risks , of the profession .

		But there are librarians , as there are writers and clergymen , who escape the peculiar danger of their calling .

		To reflections like these one may not unnaturally be moved by a course of study in the literature of library economy .

		An admirable book of its kind , entitled simply '' Library Economics , '' and composed of thirty-seven sections 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, written by nearly as many different library workers of
England	LOCATION	, has just been issued by the publishers of '' The Library World . ''

		The language is clear , the instruction is definite , the diagrams and other illustrations are all that one could wish ; but even the veriest beginner in library science might pardon - ably resent being told '' How to cut the leaves of a book '' -- a topic that has a page all to itself .

		So apparently simple a process , too , as the gumming of labels on books receives two and one-quarter pages , including a diagi-am .

		Occasionally the American reader meets with a topic of rather local than world - wide interest . ''

		Obliteration of Betting News '' in daily papers , as undesirable matter likely to attract imdesirable readers , is fortunately not a live topic with many of us .

		In the same section , by the way , near the bottom of the page , is to be noted one of the very few errors -LRB- one of grammar -RRB- that the book contains .

		Another current work of importance on library management is Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	's `` Modern American Library Economy as Illustrated by the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Free Public Library , '' one part of which has already received our notice .

		Part v. .

		Section 2 , a '' Course of Study for
Normal School Pupils	ORGANIZATION	on the Use of a Library , '' now appears out of its proper order for reasons explained in a preface .

		Here , too , as in the English work , some very ele - mentary matters are honored with a serious and cir - cumstantial treatment .

		It would be unkind to call this expatiation on the commonplace by the name of '' padding '' ; it may be useful and necessary .

		A .36 - page glossary of terms and phrases that concludes the English book is certainly replete with words whose absence would not have been seriously felt , -- e. ^ .

		, concordance , diagram , diary , manual , map , sobriquet .

		In the same volume a list of one hundred book-collectors seems not very intimately connected with library economy .

		Better redundancy than de - fect , however , in a work of this kind .

		Beginnings There is charm and romance in a fine and romance , .

		There is also to many minds -- despite
Ruskin	PERSON	's opinion to the contrary -- poetic appeal in the railway 's steel bands that gridiron the dry land and unite cities , states , and nations ; and there is a thrill in the roar of the splendidly equipped express train .

		The romance of early railroading , together with certain related incidents and experiences that partake of the curious and amusing rather than of the romantic , has furnished Mr.
Charles Frederick Carter	PERSON	with a fruitful theme for his book , '' When Railroads were New '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		From the building of the
Baltimore	LOCATION	and
Ohio	LOCATION	to the completion of the
Canadian Pacific	ORGANIZATION	, the progress of the American railroad , with brief glances at
England	LOCATION	's first steps in the same form of enterprise , is agreeably and carefully sketched , with enough of anecdote and graphic illustration to enliven the story .

		As the author remarks in his preface , '' Concerning certain aspects of the railroad , such as its finance , both high and ordinary , its construction and operation from a technical viewpoint , its moral turpitude and its predilection for manslaughter , whole libraries have been published . ''

		But matters of more general interest in the railroad 's history , especially in its very early history , have been some - what neglected ; and it is these less-known facts that the author has brought together in an attractive set - ting , having first published much of his material in '' The Railroad Man 's Magazine . ''

		A little more attention to literary finish would not have hurt the book .

		Such slips as '' laid down '' for '' lay down , '' and '' like '' in the sense of '' as , '' may not offend nine readers out of ten ; but the tenth can not over - come a certain predilection , inherited or acquired , for grammatically correct English .

		France from ^ ^ r an adequate comprehension of
Waterloo	LOCATION	to the the great problems agitating
French Third Hepiiblic	ORGANIZATION	.

		pu ^ jiig opinion -- the relations of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, the transformation of the system of taxation , the encroachment of a militant syndi - calism -- clear conceptions of the development of
France	LOCATION	are more than ever necessary .

		As an aid in reaching these , two books offer themselves , `` The Third Republic '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , written by Mr.
Frederick Lawton	PERSON	, and ``
France	LOCATION	since
Waterloo	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
W. Grinton Berry	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	has been a resident in
France	LOCATION	for twenty years , so that his book has the flavor of personal memoirs , although his own personality is discreetly kept out of sight .

		He gives a running chronicle of the repub - lic by presidencies down to the days of Fallieres and
Clemenceau	PERSON	, interspersing anecdotes and comments after the manner of a conversationalist .

		The style is occasionally familiar to say the least ; as when he says that
Rochefort	PERSON	's Intransigeant `` in its latest phase seems to serve as a sort of satyric pick-me-up giving cabby an appetite for lunch . ''

		There are special chapters on the tendencies of literature and art , on education ,
Paris	LOCATION	, and the '' Mutualist Move - ment . ''

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	thinks that the `` vast majority of the nation have abandoned the Christian faith , '' yet among these the `` standard of morality is as high , if not higher , than among their Catholic fellow - countrymen . ''

		Mr.
Berry	PERSON	's volume is not a chronicle , but a series of interpretations , a characterization of successive regimes and tendencies , evidently the result of wide reading and reflection .

		The judg - ments are in general sound , although the chapter on the '' Church and the Republic '' does not seem free from `` anti-clerical '' prejudice .

		The brief description of the Church under the old rSgime exaggerates the aristocratic vices of the clergy .

		There is also a lack of exact statement in tracing the beginnings of the present difficulties in the first Revolution .

		A famous foe ^ ^ ^ ^ fndrew
Lang	PERSON	, in his biography of the Scotch of Sir
George Mackenzie	PERSON	-LRB- Long -
Covenanters	ORGANIZATION	.

		mans -RRB- , turns his attention to the religious problems of the
Stuart Restoration	ORGANIZATION	in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		Sir
George	PERSON	was king 's advocate from
1677	DATE	to
1688	DATE	, when the Revolution terminated his
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 407 career ; and as such he found it his duty to prose - cute stubborn Presbyterians who resisted the intro - duction of episcopacy to the point of rebellion .

		So effective were his efforts in this direction , that in the tradition of the Covenanters he is known as '' Bloody ''
Mackenzie	PERSON	.

		In the opinion of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, the epithet was undeserved .

		By nature Sir
George	PERSON	was tolerant and liberal ; but such was the situation in
Scotland	LOCATION	during his time that a rational temper could not be maintained ; there was no place for the philosopher -- men had to become zealots either for the kirk or for the prerogative .

		Naturally the great lawyer chose the latter alternative .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's biog - raphy is neither an apology nor an effort at rehabil - itation ; it is a sober attempt to explain a situation that drove good Scotchmen to extremes . ''

		Mack - enzie regarded right reason as his ' one talent , ' and reason assured him , or so he persuaded himself , that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	must choose between persecution or civil war .

		I am not sure that he was mistaken . ''

		The work is therefore a study of problems rather than of a career ; the private life of the advocate is almost wholly lost sight of ; it is not so much the brilliant lawyer that attracts and impresses the reader as the great causes that he pleads or fights for .

		On the whole , the discussion is sane and con - vincing , far more calm and judicious in tone than the author 's vigorous English usually permits .

		The work is provided with several portraits of Sir
George	PERSON	, and of his famous contemporary ,
James Graham	PERSON	of Claverhouse .

		That discerning student of the side - supel ^ mon. lights of human heritage .

		Professor
Frazer	PERSON	, makes a plea for the value of superstition , under the Miltonian title , '' Psyche 's Task '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Remembering that the stages of human evolution require beliefs fitted to the cul - ture of the period and the people , it becomes no paradox that in primitive times primitive methods of guiding action were the effective ones .

		Professor
Frazer	PERSON	defends a fourfold thesis : that superstition by attaching itself to the sacredness of the ruler -LRB- surviving as the divine right of kings and the heal - ing power of the king 's touch -RRB- has contributed to the establishment of civil order ; that the fear of magic consequence concretely resulting in the taboo , brought about a respect for private property ; that superstitious beliefs in regard to the effect of irreg - ular sexual relations upon the crops and the public welfare has been a means of enforcing personal morality ; and that the fear of the vengeance of ghosts has acted to make more secure the sanctity of huinan life .

		To get right things done , even for wrong reasons , was more important for primitive society than to develop right reasons for custom and conduct .

		Thus , superstition , with all its evils in higher cultures , is yet a light , '' a dim and wavering light , which , if it has lured many a mariner on the breakers , has yet guided some wanderers on life 's troubled sea into a haven of rest and peace .

		Once the harbour lights are passed and the ship is in port .

		it matters little whether the pilot steered by a
Jack	PERSON	- o ' - lantern or by the stars . ''

		In the wider vision lies the deeper truth ; and though we need be no less rigidly scientific in loyalty to our logic , we shall be the more appreciative of the devious ways of human progress for the comprehension of Professor
Frazer	PERSON	's thesis .

		A pioneer and ^ he Rev.
Charles W. Gordon	PERSON	, better missionary in the known in literature as ''
Ralph Con	PERSON	- far Northwest , nor , '' tums aside from novel-writing long enough to relate the life of his fellow-minister in the Presbyterian Church of
Canada	LOCATION	, Dr.
James Robertson	PERSON	, a native of
Scotland	LOCATION	, who , after pastoral labors of twelve years in the land of his adoption , became Missionary Superintendent of the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	, where he did noble service for twenty-one years in planting the church in what was then little better than a wilderness .

		Seven years and more have passed since his death , but his memory is and long will be warmly cherished by those who knew him .

		No better qualified biographer of the man could have been found than the author whose books have , as he himself declares , been in no small meas - ure inspired by this vigorous and resourceful pioneer in the cause of religion .

		The true story of this '' sky pilot '' has much of the charm of romance , and is at the same time a bracing and invigorating record of worthy achievement .

		A little more revision of the author 's manuscript might have been not inad - visable .

		So good a Latin scholar as
James Robertson	PERSON	is represented to have been both by his biographer and by his Scotch schoolmaster , Alexander Mc -
Naughton	PERSON	, would have been grieved to encounter -LRB- on page 77 -RRB- so glaring a solecism as tellus ignotum .

		The lack of index is another indication of undue haste in getting the book published .

		There are sev - eral excellent and interesting portraits and other illustrations , and the book as a whole appeals strongly to the reader .

		The evolution ^ he latest work upon the orchestra , of our modern '' The Evolution of Modern Orches - orchestration .

		tration , '' is from the pen of
Louis AdolpheCoerne	LOCATION	, a musical writerof note , and deserves the consideration of musical students .

		The author has not intended to present a technical treatise on instrumentation or an analysis of the orchestra , but rather seeks to trace the evolution both of orchestra and of orchestration .

		In treating his subject , Dr.
Coerne	PERSON	reverts to the very beginnings of instrumentr ation and instruments , and shows how they have been developed ; traces their evolution through the classic era at the hands of
Bach	LOCATION	,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Gluck	PERSON	,
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and their contempo - raries ; then takes the reader through the period of romanticism and the classical romanticists ; and closes by tracing the new movement in various coun - tries .

		An appendix , consisting of musical illustra - tions , from the scores of various composers from
Monteverde	ORGANIZATION	to
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, adds interest to the work by making the evolution more clear to the 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, reader .

		The book may not have been intended as a text-book , but its arrangement and summaries would easily adapt it for teachers * uses .

		It is not a treatise in any sense , but a history of the orchestra , and from this point of view is imique .

		Thefairett '' To know the history of the
Acrop	PERSON	- cityofthe olis is to know not only the back - ^ gean Sea .

		ground of the history of
Athens	LOCATION	, it is to know also the beauty-loving spirit and the brilliant genius of the people who dwelt in the city nobly built on the ^ gean shore . ''

		This concluding sentence offers a fair index of the general spirit manifested by Professor
M. L. D'Ooge	PERSON	in his work on '' The Acropolis of
Athens	LOCATION	'' -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- .

		It should be noted , however , that the words come after many long chapters of painstaking presentation of details , and that the book is not intended primarily for entertain - ment .

		The author , who combines genuine enthu - siasm for his subject with scholarly patience , has gathered up the results of the work of many active investigators of divers nations who have been attracted by the home of
Athena	ORGANIZATION	, and has given them to us with his own thoughtful conclusions on many debatable points .

		The illustrations are laud - ably abundant , and on the whole satisfactory , although some of them would be more effective if the paper were better .

		The volume may be com - mended to the close reader of history , the exception - ally serious traveller , and the lover of things Grecian in general .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		That indefatigable student and admirer of the Dutch both at home and on the continent ,
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	, has put into attractive form `` The Story of
New Netherland	LOCATION	: the Dutch in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The writer has dressed the historical facts of his story , rather trivial and uninteresting many of them , in a readable style , and he has given much valuable and inter - esting information on the social life in
New Netherland	LOCATION	.

		Those who have their ideas of the New York Dutch and
New York	LOCATION	history from
Diedrich Knickerbocker	PERSON	should as a matter of justice read this book .

		They will find that the Dutchmen were not the ridiculous creatures of
Washington	LOCATION	Irving 's caricature , but sturdy , independ - ent , broad-minded men , worthy to rank high among the founders of our country .

		Mr.
Jethro Bithell	PERSON	, of the
University of Manchester	ORGANIZATION	, informs us that he is engaged upon a history of '' the minnesong , as compared with the old lyrical poetry of
Provence	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		As a forerunner of this work , which may be expected next year , he now puts forth `` The Minnesingers '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , being a volume of translations .

		This volume is , of course , independent of the one to come , for , as the translator justly observes of its contents , '' if they are poems , they should need no commentary : that they are poems in the original , is certain . ''

		We take satisfaction in saying that they are also poems in their English dress , poems to be enjoyed for themselves , with no arriere-pensee of a philological nature .

		Mr.
Bithell	PERSON	has been singularly successful in his management of both rhymes and rhythms , and has taken few liberties at that .

		He speaks of his '' spade-work '' and his '' plaster-cast '' method , but this is a note of quite uncalled-for modesty .

		This volume is a real enrichment of the literature of poetic translation .

		Messrs.
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers of Mr.
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	's '' The Literary Man 's Bible '' in its new -LRB- fourth -RRB- edition .

		The work includes a group of brief introductory essays , followed by the text of the greater part of the books of the Old Testament , their contents classified , and printed in readable form .

		The authorized version is used , as a matter of course .

		Such a book as this does inestimable service to the cause of religion , and it is pleasant to know that it is in the continuous demand that its successive editions would seem to indicate .

		Miss
Maude M. Frank	PERSON	, a teacher in one of the
New York City	LOCATION	High Schools , has prepared a volume of '' Constructive Exercises in English '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , which is an original attempt to teach variety of diction , clear paragraphing , and some skill in the various forms of literary expression .

		Miss Frank 's idea seems to be : Give the pupil a start at first , and in time he will be able to make a way for himself .

		Accordingly , theory is minimized , and there are plenty of constructive exercises intended to arouse the pupil 's interest and stimulate his ideas , and far more likely to do so than the unapproach - able rules with which many rhetorics abound .

		Miss
Anna Morgan	PERSON	, a well-known teacher of Dra - matic Expression in
Chicago	LOCATION	, is the author of two com - panion volumes , which are published in attractive bindings by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' The Art of Speech and Deportment '' explains , generally in question and answer style , such matters as grace of carriage , the correct use of the voice , and platform man - ners , corrects many erroi-s of pronunciation and diction , and gives a brief history of the drama in English , French , Spanish , Italian , and German , with some prac - tical directions for rehearsing an amateur production . ''

		Selected Readings '' contains short sketches in prose and poetry , with a few in dramatic form , all chosen -- and in many cases especially abridged -- for their suitability to be read or recited .

		Naturally selections in lighter vein predominate .

		Notes .

		Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	has chosen a Shaker community for the setting of her next novel , to be pub - lished in the early
Autumn	DATE	under the title '' Siisanna and Sue . ''

		A new novel by Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	is announced for Fall publication , to be entitled '' The Bride of the Mistletoe . ''

		It will be the first work that has come from Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's pen in six years .

		The
Whitaker & Ray Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	, are pub - lishing a six-volume edition of Joaquin MUler 's Poems .

		The first volume , now at hand , contains a few poems only , being mainly occupied by autobiographical matter in prose , and extracts from the English reviews of the author 's work .

		Spinoza 's '' Short Treatise , '' having for its subject `` God , Man , and Human Welfare , '' was the philoso - pher 's first work .

		Dated about
1660	DATE	, it was originally written in
Latin	LOCATION	, and soon afterwards translated by a friend into Dutch .

		The Latin manuscript has been lost ,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 409 but a Dutch manuscript survives ; from this version an English translation has been made by Miss
Lydia Gillingham Robinson	PERSON	, and is now printed by
the Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sehwegler 's chapter on
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	is given as an introduction .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co	ORGANIZATION	publish the following French texts :
M. Rostand	PERSON	's `` La Princesse Lointaine , '' edited by Professor
J. L. Borgerhoff	PERSON	;
Louis Desnoyers	PERSON	's '' Les M ^ saventures de
Jean-Paul Choppart	PERSON	, '' edited by
M. C. Fontaine	PERSON	; '' and
Tocqueville	ORGANIZATION	's `` Voyage en Am ^ rique , '' edited by Professor
R. Clyde Ford	PERSON	.

		An in - teresting volume in the '' Oxford Higher French Series '' is the '' Preface du Cromwell '' of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, edited by Professor
Edmond Wahl	PERSON	.

		One of the most interesting of recent Grerman auto - biographies is the volume of '' Memoiren '' by
Baroness Bertha von Suttner	PERSON	, well known as a writer and an en - thusiastic and eloquent advocate of international peace , to whose influence
Alfred Nobel	PERSON	of
Sweden	LOCATION	became so deeply interested in the cause of international peace as to establish the annual prize for the most efficient pro- moters of it , this prize being awarded in
1905	DATE	to
Bertha von Suttner	PERSON	herself .

		An edition of her Memoirs , in English , is soon to be published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the translation having been made by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		The
Arthur H. Clark Co.	PERSON	, of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, announce the early publication of a new historical series , in ten vol - imies , entitled '' Documentary History of
American Industrial Society	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The
American Bureau of Indus	ORGANIZATION	- trial Research and the Carnegie Institution of Washing - ton have been engaged jointly for a number of years in preparing this publication .

		The first two volumes , entitled '' Plantation and
Frontier	ORGANIZATION	, '' will be the work of Professor
Ulrich B. Phillips	PERSON	.

		The next two , on '' Labor Conspiracy Cases , '' are to be prepared jointly by Pro- fessors
John R. Commons	PERSON	and
Eugene A. Gilmore	PERSON	.

		The six remaining volumes will contain a study of the
Labor Movement	ORGANIZATION	from
1820	DATE	to
1880	DATE	.

		As the first exhaustive study of our economic and industrial conditions this set of books should prove a valuable work of reference .

		The concordance to
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, which has been in preparation for the
Concordance Society	ORGANIZATION	, is now com - pleted , though as yet no definite steps have been taken to secure its publication .

		The work has been done under the direction of Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, with the help of over forty collaborators .

		The text is based upon that of
Hutchinson	PERSON	's
Oxford Wordsworth	PERSON	, supplemented by the editions of
Nowell Smith	ORGANIZATION	and Knight .

		For the most part , the quotations have not been transcribed , but cut out and mounted from the printed page .

		This ought to insure a high degree of exactness in such matters as punctuation and the use of capital letters .

		Only the commonest words , particles and the like , have been omitted .

		In all , there are about 200,000 entries .

		It may surprise some readers to learn that in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's poetry the refer - ences to man , and similarly to mind , are considerably more numerous than those to nature .

		The coming harvest of
Meredithiana	ORGANIZATION	will doubtless be a rich one .

		Chief among the books about the de - ceased novelist and poet is likely to be the expected biography from the pen of his intimate friend , Mr.
Edward Clodd	PERSON	, whose equipment and facilities for the undertaking are unsurpassed .

		Already a critical work on
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	's influence upon English fiction , by Mr.
E. J. Bailey	PERSON	, has been announced ; and Mr.
J. A. Hammerton	PERSON	's ''
George Meredith	PERSON	in Anecdote and Crit - icism , '' begun more than seven years ago and at first designed as a memorial of
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	's eightieth birth - day , has just been published , or is soon to be published , with many illustrations , by Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	.

		Meredith 's correspondence , the only writing of import - ance from his pen during his last years , will not see print if his informally expressed wish is respected .

		But it is more than probable that in the end he will join the distinguished company of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Whistler	LOCATION	and numerous others whose like prohibition has been regarded as losing its binding force in the light of subsequent developments -- which is very satisfying and acceptable to a curious posterity .

		Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, librarian of the
Newark Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Henry W. Kent	PERSON	, Assistant Secretary of the New York Metropolitan Museum , have planned a series of six volumes to be called the `` Librarians ' Series , '' of which only one thousand sets will be pub - lished , at a subscription price of five dollars for the entire series .

		Brief descriptions follow : '' The Old Librarian 's Almanack , '' a reprint of a curious pamphlet containing counsel and opinion from a librarian and book lover of
1773	DATE	; '' The Rev.
John Sharpe	PERSON	and His Proposal for a
Publick Library	ORGANIZATION	at
New York	LOCATION	,
1713	DATE	, '' being the sketch of a Colonial book-lover , at once a pathetic and com - mandii ^ figure , told from first-hand sources , by
Austin Baxter	PERSON	Keep ; `` The Librarian , '' being selections from the ''
Boston Transcript	ORGANIZATION	's '' Library department during the last three years ; an annotated list of the best books on the history and administration of libraries published before
1800	DATE	, compiled by
Beatrice Wisner	PERSON	of
Newark	LOCATION	; a translation of Delespierre 's '' Hoax Concerning the Burning of the Alexandrine Library '' ; and an adaptation of Dziatzko 's '' Early History of Libraries '' in Pauly 's '' Encyclopaedia of Classical Antiquities . ''

		The issue of the set is conditioned upon the securing of a sufficient number of subscriptions .

		These should be addressed to the Elm Tree Press ,
Woodstock	LOCATION	,
