		NOTES 26 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 27 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 28 AMERICAN BOOKS .

		The old scomfal query , Who reads an Amer - ican book ?

		has long since lost whatever point it had , for wherever the English language is read at all , the American contribution to Eng - lish literature receives its full meed of attention and appreciation .

		The foreigner 's estimate of the comparative standing of our writers is sometimes a little puzzling , and his praise is not always discriminating according to our own standards .

		Bat we no longer have cause to complain of his neglect , and it has now become our concern , not so much to attract his atten - tion to cor literature , as to turn that attention in the right direction .

		To the British or other foreigner looking for guidance in this matter of appreciation we should like to recommend a reading of the symposium , '' The Most Amer - ican Books '' which was published not long ago in our valued contemporary , '' The Outlook . ''

		What is an American book ?

		was the question set to be answered by a number of thoughtful students of our literature , and the opinions given prove extremely interesting , both intrin - sically and because of their essential agree - ment .

		The question raised , it will be noticed , is not of the best books produced in
America	LOCATION	, but of the books that are the most distinctively repre - sentative of American life and thought .

		No doubt the two categories have much in common , but they will also diverge widely at several points .

		We think , for example , of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	, and Irving .

		They are among the best of our writers , but may we say that they are typically American in their spirit ?

		With respect to
Poe	PERSON	the answer is quite clear that , as Professor
Dowden	PERSON	puts it , '' he would have differed little from his actual self had he been bom on an Irish hillside or in a German forest , or in any ultimate dim
Thule	LOCATION	, where it was possible for a dexterous brain to rehandle the suggestions of a subtle imagination . ''

		In the case of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	, there is a marked diversity of view .

		He was American in his themes -LRB- for the most part -RRB- , and this seems to justify Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	in saying that
Cooper	PERSON	has given ua '' the ideal type of the pioneer , of the white man in romantic contact with the wilderness , expanding into a new being and taking on a new form and opening up a new human capa - bility in character . ''

		But Dr.
Hale	PERSON	, admitting the wide European acceptance of
Cooper	PERSON	as • tjrpically American writer , is forced to almost exactly the opposite conclusion . ''

		All the same , '' he says , `` these novels are not really American , excepting that they tell about Indians and trails and blazed trees and rifles and buckshot and moccasins .

		There was no moment in
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's life when he would not have been pleased to be mistaken for an En - glishman . ''

		There is a somewhat similar dif - 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ference of opinion in the case of Irving .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	remarks that '' much of Irving could be English , '' and Professor
Matthews	PERSON	thinks that , with
Cooper	PERSON	, he must be ruled out because we can say no more for him than that he wrote `` cer - tain books dealing delightfully with the exter - nals of American life . ''

		But Professor Wood - berry , having chiefly in view Irving 's handling of the legendary material of his native State , makes the following strong plea for his Amer - icanism : ' ♦ Next in order comes that reincarnation of the world - old myth completely born again into local habitation and a name ,
Rip Van Winkle	PERSON	, in ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow . '

		Such a birth is the rarest of literary phe - nomena , and stands in lieu of folk-lore , which never dies . ''

		Turning now to the instances of substantial agreement among our symposiasts , we find that
Emerson	PERSON	's essays and
Hawthorne	PERSON	's romances come foremost in the minds of nearly all of them .

		Concerning the former , Professor Miin - aterberg says : '' It was always my opinion that no element of the American spirit is more es - sential than the often veiled idealism : I take
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's essays as its noblest literary docu - ment . ''

		And Professor
Dowden	PERSON	says much the same thing in the following language : '' A characteristic of much that strikes a stranger as indigenous in American literature is the juxtaposition , and at its best the fusion , in it of a very keen percep - tion of fact and of a lofty , sometimes a rarefied , kind of idealism ... The idealism of Emerson appears some - times to be highly attenuated , but at its best it is the exact translation of reality into what is yet more real -- the idea . ''

		Of
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and especially of '' The Scarlet Letter , '' we are told by
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	that * ' all the volumes of all the historical societies can not bring that remote atmosphere before us as he does . ''

		And Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's dictum is this : '' Add to
New England	LOCATION	vividness of perception and
New England	LOCATION	ideality a sentiment of romance to which the remoteness from the mediaeval world gives a certain wistfulness , and you have an expression for much that lay in the genius of Hawthorne . ''

		With something less of unanimity , but with no essential difference of opinion , we find the names of
Lowell	LOCATION	and Whitman put forward as representative of the typically American spirit in literature . ''

		The
Biglow Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' says Col - onel
Higginson	PERSON	, '' takes the lead of unequivo - cally American books '' ; Dr.
Hale	PERSON	calls them '' absolutely characteristic '' ; and Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	says that they '' sum up Yankee nature with more telling effect than any of the pastoral writers who have used the form for political ends , nor is the work more loaded with dialect and contemporary detail than is cus - tomary in such compositions . ''

		Of Whitman 's work , we are told by Professor
Miiasterberg	PERSON	that it `` tells the whole story '' of `` the demo - cratic temper of American society , '' by Pro- fessor
Dowden	PERSON	that it makes '' an effort to en - visage at once the vast materiality of the
United States	LOCATION	and to reveal the underlying spiritu - ality , '' and by Professor
Matthews	PERSON	that it makes '' plain the American acceptance of human equality , the fundamental respect for the dig - nity of the individual , and , above all , the superb belief in the future -- the ingrained optimism which is perhaps the most salient element of our Americanism . ''

		Among the writers whose names find nu - merous champions in this competition for the honors of typical Americanism , and would doubtless be accepted by the others were not the selection so limited , are ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	, ''
Thoreau	PERSON	, and
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		The first of these men , according to Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, stands for `` American humor in its grotesque aspect of hearty laughter . ''

		Of
Thoreau	PERSON	's ''
Walden	PERSON	, ''
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	says that '' neither its materials , nor its aims could have been combined elsewhere ; and the
National	ORGANIZATION	life sings through it , precisely as the drum of the village youth , as described elsewhere by
Thoreau	PERSON	, goes echoing through the darkness on the
night	TIME	before the village muster . ''

		And of
Bret Harte	PERSON	we read in Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's words , to which no one can object , that his prose and verse '' sprang from the soil of the
Pacific	LOCATION	slope as naturally as its pines and redwoods ; in them is the old
California	LOCATION	. ''

		A large number of books and authors not heretofore mentioned are named by one or another of the contributors to the discussion .

		Among the books most clearly entitled to in - clusion in a representative list are
Whittier	LOCATION	's '' Snowbound , ''
Longfellow	PERSON	's `` Hiawatha , '' Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's ``
Silas Lapbam	PERSON	, `` Judd ' 8 `` Margaret , ''
Holmes	PERSON	's '' Autocrat , '' ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' and the histories of Parkman and
Fiske	PERSON	.

		Of '' Snowbound , ''
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	says that '' there is not in all literature , probably , a family group so graphically and indeed im - mortally portrayed . ''

		Of ''
Hiawatha	LOCATION	, '' Pro- fessor
Woodberry	PERSON	says that '' the world has found this white man 's epic of the dying race of the forest-dwellers the single poetic embodi - ment of the Indian world , and no savage world has ever attracted the imagination and sym - pathy of men as strongly as the Indian . ''


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI . ''

		The Puritan oonscientiuusDess , '' saya Profes - sor Miiosterberg , is '' perhaps nowhere char - acterized with finer artistic qaality than in •
Silas Lapham	PERSON	/ '' Of ''
Margaret	PERSON	, '' Dr.
Hale	PERSON	says that the book had better be hunted up by '' anybody outside of
New England	LOCATION	who wants a oompiehensive idea of
New England	LOCATION	character in the active duties of
New England	LOCATION	life a hundred years ago . ''

		The '' Autocrat , '' according to Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, embodies American humor in its '' smilingly sentimental '' aspect .

		`` Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' says Professor Wood berry , '' for better or worse , has been and will remain the picture of the South under slavery , of the slave , the master , and the life . ''

		Finally , it is Dr.
Hale	PERSON	who argues most elo - quently for the American school of historians : for
Parkman	PERSON	, whom he styles '' the most dis - tinctly American author in this American school , '' for
Fiske	PERSON	, `` who compels people to read American history who never read it before . ''

		A distinctive feature of this discussion is the recognition it gives to the literary work of our great statesmen and patriots .

		Miss
Grace King	ORGANIZATION	speaks of the period of the Revolution as ' • the classical era of our patriotic genius , '' and the names of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and Web - ster , of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Grant	PERSON	, appear many times among the chosen repre - sentatives of American spirit .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	even insists upon the Constitution as one of his ten typically American books .

		Grant , in par - ticular , both for his memoirs and his despatches , is singled out by a number of the contributors , in which connection we may recall the high praise bestowed upon the • ' Memoirs '' by no less a critic than
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		We come aeross an occasional '' freak '' judgment , as in the case of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	's mention of Miss
Helen Kellar	PERSON	's '' The Story of my Life , '' and of Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's word for such writers as Mr.
Kiley	PERSON	and Mr.
Ade	PERSON	.

		And Professor
Mnn	PERSON	- sterberg indulges in a little fun at our expense when he says that '' A book like Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	's ' Science and Health ' might be written any - where : but that it should be bought by the hundred thousand is possible only through the mental disposition of Americans . '' '

		As an ex - ample of the books that embody the defects of our national virtues , this amazing performance may also be called a characteristic production of the American spirit .

		In conclusion , we wish to supplement our series of special quotations by two excerpts of a more general character , one from an Amer - ican , and the other from an English observer .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	pertinently says of the Amer - ican spirit : `` First , it has Youth .

		We are a jmn ^ natwn , and poMfM the joQDg virtues and the j-oangfaoUs ; the hope , the dariog , the generosity , the extravagaaee , the impa - tience , the irreverenee of yoath .

		Bat , next , we are an old peopU -- Faiitans ,
Hngoenots	LOCATION	; and this means fatal - ism , subtlety , a strange sadness , a pondering the prob - lem of evil , a power of asceticism , and of exaltation . ''

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's general comment is as follows : '' Perhaps the theory is trae that American idealism can be traced in part to Puritanism , and that what we mar call a defecated Puritanism becomes almost inev - itably a cult of the ideal .

		Tocqueville will have it , and perhaps he is right , that a great democracy is in its very nature prone to ideal ways of thinking and feeling , with results at once reassuring and open to the gravest risks .

		But the qnick recognition of facts , and the shrewdness , the stability , which this engenders is a cheek upon the dangers which are perhaps inherent in a democracy . ''

		D'ANNUNZIO .

		POET AND PLAYWBIGHT .

		In
America	LOCATION	, and also in
Europe	LOCATION	outside of
Italy	LOCATION	, d'AnnuDzio ' B fame prior to the publication of Fran ^ eesea da Birnini .

		has been as a novelist .

		It is now seven or eight years since the Same det
Deux Monde	PERSON	* published `` The Triumph of Death , '' and
M. de Vogne	PERSON	hailed him as the leader of an Italian Benaisganee .

		From that time , his novels have bean famous throughout # arop > e and
America	LOCATION	; whereas his poetry has been scarcely known except in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		To Italians , however , at least to his disciples and their friends , d'Annnnzio , even in his novels , is essentially a poet .

		It is not easy for an American , bred in the habits , notions , and prejadiees which we call Anglo-Saxon education , to be just to d'Annunuo , even as a poet ; for we are almost sure to approach his poetry through his novels , and these revolt all oar natural sentiments .

		We are separated from him by the gulf of race .

		Even his virtues , in great part , are beyond our sympathies ; for we , on our side , do not belong to the gentil sangue Latin , nor do we understand d'Annansio 's most sincere , most praise - worthy trait , -- the conscience of the artist , a con - science as imperious , as self-sufficient , as disdainful I as that of the Puritans . '

		To d'AnnuDzio himself , his aim is spiritual ; yet to say in English that d'AnnnDzio labors for the spiritual life is to impose a strange burden upon those already heavily laden words .

		His understanding of the spirit is di # Perent from ours ; Americans are prone to separate the spiritual from the intellectaal , d'Annnnzio is inclined to confound the two .

		He aims to enfranchise the intellect , to rescue it from the bonds of an ignorant social order , to enlarge the horizon of men by poetry .

		For him , intellectual exploitation of the senses is spiritual , it is man 's 8 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, highest life ; and the expression of that intellectual enjoyment is poetry .

		He is a great artist ; he has propriety , order , gradation , harmony , in word and thought ; instinctively he shudders at formlessness .

		He is not inspired ; he is the product of modern cul - ture , not a natural force expressing itself under the ordinary impulses of life .

		He has lived more on other men 's thoughts than on his own ; a careful perusal of his books shows the periods in which different mas - ters were in the ascendant .

		He has not the power of assimilation , that predatory habit of happy genius bestowed upon a Raphael or a Keats ; on the con - trary , his very lack of capacity to force the ideas and methods of other men to deny their creators , as it were , and serve him , marks the limit of his genius .

		Nevertheless he has a clever knack of cribbing .

		At sixteen d'Annunzio had become famous ; critics jostled each other in their hurry to be the first to do him honor .

		He went from success to success ; and from
1881	DATE	his poems have been hailed , one after the other , as the work of a rival to
Carducci	PERSON	.

		A lyric poet is , and must be , exaggeratedly per - sonal in his relations to us ; we like him , or we do not , for causes that lie deep in ourselves .

		We like him , perhaps , because he has unlocked , by a mere random sequence of words , some old neglected memory , or stirred a common human sentiment and left us less lonely , or because he has pulled aside the curtain of familiarity from something of beauty .

		With
d'Annunzio	PERSON	, it is not so .

		From the first , we feel in our bones that he can not be our poet .

		We are oppressed by the hard lustre of his Latin genius , that shines so glaringly , and disregards the gray tints which we love , and all the pleasant sombreness of life .

		But no doubt we fall short in our duty as readers ; his art fails in its effect upon us because ' we are not sensitive to it , our drowsy susceptibilities sleep through his knocking .

		We feel that he is a stranger to the haunts of our affections ; he utters many melodious phrases , but not our pass-word ; he is challenged by our rude dumb instincts , which know that he has no part in the patriotism of our souls .

		Whether he is our poet or not , his is a very in - teresting personality .

		Behind his sensuous descrip - tions is not feeling , but intellect ; behind his intellect is not genius , but a Roman will , which joins with his ambition in high resolve to achieve a new life for
Italy	LOCATION	, and wills to use poetry as its instrument .

		Nevertheless , will and intellect , applied to lyrical talents , will not , without the addition of experience , turn a poet into a playwright ; and in d'Annunzio 's plays we miss experience of the stage .

		He should have been apprenticed to a scene-shifter , cursed by the stage-manager , bullied by the second lady , and thus have acquired the lore of stage-craft .

		No genius can supply the lack of long familiarity with the stage .

		Of such knowledge the novelist , who desires to become a playwright , and more than all others the psychological novelist , stands in especial need : in the drama , living actors are the medium of expression ; in story-telling , printer 's ink , -- and the difference is immense .

		Among the defects of d'Annunzio 's novels are intense subjectiveness , narrowness of human inter - est , and an indefatigable prolixity .

		The same defects hurt his plays ; but the exigencies of the stage have helped him ; they limit , if they can not abolish , the author 's soliloquies , and they discourage prolixity .

		His earlier plays .

		La Gioconda and
Citth Morta	PERSON	, mark the period of his apprentice - ship .

		The plot of
La Gioconda	LOCATION	is briefly this : A sculptor moulds a beautiful statue ; during the work the model acquires a power over the sculptor , so that without her he is incapable of achievement .

		Soon he finds himself in love with her and estranged from his wife , who is both good and beautiful .

		The mental strain of this situation makes him danger - ously ill .

		His wife , by her devoted nursing , saves his life ; and thinking that illness has broken his illegitimate bonds , confronts the model and attempts to send her away .

		In this scene the wife and the model are merely the sculptor 's emotions personified : one representing duty to art , a duty which only the chosen few can perform ; the other , that com - mon duty to a wife which lies within the reach of every husband .

		The wife tells a lie , saying that her husband had commanded the model to depart .

		In a rage of despair , the model springs forward to break the statue for which she had sat ; the wife throws out her arms and saves the falling marble from breaking , but her hands are horribly maimed and have to be amputated .

		The victory is with the model .

		In this play d'Annunzio has chosen the tragic and ethical theme that a man can not serve two masters ; but in his endeavor to portray an ethical situation he has only succeeded at the expense of human interest .

		The two women who struggle for the artist 's soul are but two conflicting moral prin - ciples , and nobody cares what becomes of the soul .

		La Citth Morta -LRB- `` The Dead City '' -RRB- is a play of greater ambition .

		D'Annunzio has attempted what he perhaps would call a younger sister to the
Attic	LOCATION	dramas ; he has taken what he believes to be a Greek theme , and in order to strengthen his situ - ation he has laid the scene near
Mycense	LOCATION	.

		The characters are a poet , his blind wife and a brother and sister engaged in excavating the tombs of Agamemnon and
Cassandra	PERSON	.

		Both husband and brother fall , in love with the sister ; there is no action ; the brother , overcome by horror at his own love , and not untouched with jealousy , drowns his sister .

		The horror of the plot is dulled by prolixity , and by the lack of human interest in the characters -LRB- dreams of a morbid scholar -RRB- , who spend their im - mense leisure in talking of the Antigone , of
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- sandra , of the plains of Argos and the gulf of
Corinth	LOCATION	, not for the menial purpose of carrying forward the plot , but to awake a chill sense of the past , and to recall the cold presence of the long dead .

		Tragedy requires some unreality ; it requires iso - lation from ` daily life , whose unheroic little needs comfort humanity and spoil tragedy ; but the

		THE DIAL .

		,9 strained qaalitj of d'Annanzio does not transport as into the heroic anreality of Attic tragedy , it only carries us into a breezeless atmosphere of morbid fwychologr .

		The play is a mere ftndy of abnormal psychic conditions , too abnormal for general interest .

		too subjective for the stage , from which both it and La Gioconda would be promptly banished were it not for the self-sacrifice of the great actress who has devoted her ten talents to their service .

		The plot of ''
Francesca	PERSON	da
Rimini	LOCATION	'' is briefly this : For political reasons
Francesca	PERSON	's family , the
Polentani	LOCATION	.

		lords of
Ravenna	LOCATION	, desire to marry her to
Oianciotto	PERSON	, the oldest son of
Malatesta	PERSON	of
Rimini	LOCATION	; bnt they fear her ref asal , as
Gianeiotto	ORGANIZATION	is both lame * nd ill-favored ; therefore they trick her into the belief that Paolo the beaatiful , his younger brother , is to be her hagband .

		Francesca is betrothed , goes to
Rimini	LOCATION	and there is undeceived ; but that first belief , that Paolo was to be hers and she his .

		avenges itself , and the two love each other from that mo - ment .

		The youngest brother ,
Malatestino	PERSON	, who attempts to pay his addresses to his beautiful sister - in-law and is repulsed , betrays the lovers to Gian - eiotto .

		Dramatic interest centres in four figures .

		Francesca and the three brothers .

		Gianeiotto is a Renaissance despot ^ who limps across the stage in vigorous fashion .

		He is well done , but he suffers in English eyes in that , while his fierceness and lameness and ambition recall
Richard III.	PERSON	, he has not the interest of inhumanity , he is not turned devil by physical defects ; he is but a rude soldier , roughly seeking to despoil his neighbor .

		The best-drawn character is that of
Malatestino	LOCATION	, who in a few rude sentences reveals the traditional Renaissance ferocity .

		Paolo is inferior , he is the palest of all d'Annunzio 's likeneg '' eg of himself , too little individual , too much the attendant character to
Francesca	LOCATION	; he is a poseur , weak with the ordi - nary weaknesses of a jeune premier , and his very ineffectiveness puts him beyond the reach of tragedy .

		He lores
Francesca	PERSON	, but his love does not bear marks of fatality , or if so , of a fatality that to day sweeps him to
Francesca	LOCATION	, and to-morrow will sweep him to
Giovanna	PERSON	, and the next to
Lucia	LOCATION	, and so onward still .

		The interest in an adulterer must lie in the clash between duty to love and doty to honor , when '' honor rooted in dishonor stands '' ; but Paolo is nnvexed by any sentiment of disloyalty to his brother .

		Francesca is a more interesting figure , but she is not essentially different from d'Annunzio 's other heroines .

		At home in
Ravenna	LOCATION	she has fed on tales of old romance told by an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	slave , and lived in day-dreams colored by a melancholy foreboding .

		She falls in love with Paolo at first sight ; and as her tricky marriage to Gianeiotto leaves her in doubt as to whom her allegiance is due , she is sub - ject to an ethical bewilderment of which
Paolo	ORGANIZATION	is unconscious .

		In her speeches there are passages of real poetry ; and sometimes , when pathos colors the lines , they nestle in the memory with true lyric confidence .

		Bat everywhere , over every scene , over every person , hangs prolixity like a pall .

		Just as interest rises , just as pity stirs , comes a cold shower of words , that strew the ground like leaves in
Vallom	LOCATION	- broga .

		smothering interegt .

		choking pity , till nothing but that resolution which is said to be the character - istic of our dominant race enables us to be patient to the end .

		The first act , which only serves to let
Francesca	PERSON	and Paolo see each other , and to inform the spectators that she believes he is to be her hus - band , begins with a gay and distinctly long scene between the waiting-women and the jongleur ; it goes on with an unnecessary episode about Fran - cesca 's brother , introduced to produce historical effect , and continues with a long discourse between
Francesca	PERSON	and her sister , and only ends when
Francesca	PERSON	sees Paolo at the gate ; fortunately , they say nothing , and the curtain drops .

		In the other acta are a long apostrophe to Greek fire , a minute examination of a peddlar 's pack , made with the leis - ure of a lady when society is out of town , and the story of a hawk ; all scenes which are adapted for a novel , but deadly for a play .

		Yet , with all its faults , if a tyrannical stage-manager were to take the play with earte blanche to eat , and should do his obvious duty , this play woald remain andoobt - edly the best tragedy ever produced in
Italy	LOCATION	, and would rank high on the English stage .

		D'Annunzio has made an immense effort to se - cure fidelity to fact ; he has thrown himself with his wonted zeal into arras , headdress , mangonel , cross - bow , hawking , and haberdashery ; he has pressed into service jongleur , peddlar , and astrologer , and no doubt he has made a good picture of life in
Rimini	LOCATION	near the year
1300	DATE	.

		The scenes are brilliant , and might have been drawn by
Boccaccio	PERSON	; they fumiah a very beautiful and finished frame for the tragedy .

		D'Annunzio himself recognizes the danger of too many accessories , and in order to overcome that danger and to give to his drama a touch of poetic ambience , of that detachment from the world which tragedy requires , he adopts ingenuous devices .

		He naes ref > etition , which , like a succession of echoes , confounds the memory and the imagination and serves as a fair makeshift for the presence of mys - tery .

		He also introduces snatches from
Dante	LOCATION	which recall the solemnity of the eternal punishment that lies before the lovers .

		And everywhere be is the aitist .

		Every scene , every speech , every word , is put in nice relation to the whole ; no volunteer phrases come straggling in , -- they are drilled , equipped , and marched into place , in accordance with a carefully matured plan .

		It is interesting to gee how d'Annunzio has been both hurt and helped by the greatest of Italian poets .

		Dante has rendered d'Annunzio 's historical accuracy , at least for the reader in his closet , hope - lessly wrong .

		Paolo and Franceses , the lovers whom we know , are not historical ; they are not
Riminesi	LOCATION	.

		but
Dantesque	LOCATION	.

		They did not live in the flesh , but in the greatest lines of the Divine Com - edy .

		They are apparitions , beautified and idealized 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, by the genius of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, endowed with such life and experience as he gave them , and no more .

		They live forever on the infernal blast , and there is a hopeless incongruity in surrounding them with antique furniture and mediaeval millinery .

		But d'AnnuDzio has also received a blessing ; he has * '' touched
Dante	PERSON	's dead , '' and he has acquired a modesty that seemed beyond his power ; for a mo - ment he has seen a glimmer , as it were , of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's belief that the bond of sex is but a rude symbol of a completer union where the individual shall no longer be isolated by his own imprisoning senses .

		And yet we can not but resent as impiety that a man should be so rash as to overstep by a hair 's breadth the prohibition in the line , Qael giorno pia non vi leggemmo avanti , -LRB- That day we read no more therein . -RRB-

		The end of the play is weak .

		Paolo attempts to escape down a trap-door , and is caught by some mediaeval equivalent for coat-tails , leaving head and shoulders standing out ; from this ignominious and somewhat ludicrous position he must be rescued , in order that he and
Francesca	PERSON	may die in each other 's arms .

		Gianciotto pulls him up by the hair , and then runs him through .

		In spite of all , this play is far and away d'An - nunzio 's best achievement ; it is more interesting , more a # fecting , mure virile than his other dramas or his novels ; it is more human , and has a sensu - ous richness and an orderly advance that mark a great gain indramatic art .

		This improvement comes in part from the poet 's growth in knowledge and experience ; but we must also look further , for neither in novel nor in drama has there been promise of such a sudden leap forward , and surely we can detect the advice of trained experience and the promptings of a delicacy and tact which can only belong to the great actress ,
Eleanora Duse	PERSON	dalle belle mani ; so that we may ascribe the play to what
Charles Lamb	PERSON	calls the noble practise of collaboration .

		* The story is told of an old lady who derived great comfort and help from a borrowed vol - ume of
Martineau	PERSON	's sermons until one day she learned , to her horror , that they were by a Unitarian , when she speedily returned the book to its owner , remarking that the effect of its reading was like that of a pleasant poison .

		Probably no collection of sermons has im - parted more of spiritual uplift to a wide circle of readers than the two volumes of ''
Endeav	PERSON	- ours after a Christian Life . ''

		Their entire freedom from doctrinal discussion , and their moving appeal to our common religious nature and aspirations , render them fit reading for all .

		Their poetic beauty of diction makes each chap - ter a '' lyric utterance , '' which was the author 's ideal of what a sermon should be .

		Like Chan - ning and like
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, with whom he is naturally associated as one of the three lead - ers of liberal religious thought in the nineteenth century ,
Martineau	PERSON	was a vehement protestant against everything that savors of arbitrary authority in religion .

		With them , too , he pro- tested against certain tendencies in the Uni - tarian church that seemed to him narrow and injurious .

		So catholic was he in matters of religion that he disliked the idea of any less inclusive ecclesiastical organization than that of the church universal ; and though he called himself & Unitarian , he did not favor the name as a denominational label .

		These points of similarity between the three champions of
Uni	ORGANIZATION	- tarianism serve well to indicate wherein reside the real strength and usefulness of that denomi - nation , its true mission being to liberalize the church as a whole , and to promote Christian unity , rather than to gain converts to its own specific form of faith .

		We have long had on our bookshelves ample biographies of Channing and
Parker	PERSON	.

		To them is now added a full and painstaking life of
Martineau	PERSON	, who , it is curious to recall , was born five years before
Parker	PERSON	and only twenty-five after
Channing	PERSON	.

		Both Dr.
Drammood	PERSON	and Professor
Upton	PERSON	had long been associated with
Martineau	PERSON	as officers of Man - chester College , and no men better fitted for the preparation of his biography could have been found .

		The '' Life and Letters '' occupy the first volume and half of the second ; the * ' Survey of his Philosophical Work '' is crowded into the remaining half-volume .

		In a letter to the Eev .


W. R. Alger	PERSON	, Mar - tineau speaks of '' a certain loneliness of spirit '' that had been his from childhood .

		It is this loneliness of spirit , or , better expressed , this loftiness of spirituality , that renders him an anpromising subject for popular biography .

		His life is traced in his thought and in his writings ; the accidental shifting of the bodily tenement from
Norwich	LOCATION	to
Bristol	LOCATION	, from
Bristol	LOCATION	to
York	LOCATION	, to
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		Liverpool ,
London	LOCATION	, signi - fies but little .


Harriet Martineaus	PERSON	autobiog - raphy long ago made us familiar with the more important features of the family history .

		That heroic struggle on the children 's part to clear an honored father 's name from the reproach of insolvency , was vividly depicted by her .

		The present biographer , strangely enough , passes over this period with merely a brief mention of straitened circumstances .

		The noble and self - sacrificing conduct of young Mr.
Martineau	PERSON	in resigning his
Dublin	LOCATION	pastorate , because he could not conscientiously accept the regium donum , is described in detail .

		A fall accoant also is given of the so-called Liverpool Con - troversy , in which
Martineau	PERSON	, now pastor of the
Paradise Street Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, united with the two other liberal dissenting ministers of the city in defending their common faith against a venomous assault from thirteen Anglican clergymen .

		The fortunes of
Manchester Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege -LRB- afterward
Manchester New College	ORGANIZATION	, and then again known under its original name -RRB- are rather closely followed in this biography of him who most contributed to its success as a theological school for dissenters .

		From Man - chester to
York	LOCATION	, thence back to
Manchester	LOCATION	, thence to
London	LOCATION	, and finally to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, the • college wandered in quest of a permanent abid - ing place .

		Associated with it as a student at
York	LOCATION	, as a lecturer at
Manchester	LOCATION	, and as pro- fessor and afterward principal in
London	LOCATION	,
Martineau	PERSON	has linked his name inseparably with its history .

		It was in his work as pro- fessor of mental and moral philosophy that he first drew the attention of the learned world to his depth and power of thought .

		Though public recognition of his extraordinary abilities came late in life , it came at last in fuU measure .

		America honored herself by being the first to bestow on him an honorary degree .

		In
1872	DATE
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	made him a doctor of laws ;
Leyden	PERSON	followed three years later with a doctorate of systematic theology ;
Edinburgh	LOCATION	added
D.D.	LOCATION	to his name in
1884	DATE	;
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	came lagging along in
1888	DATE	with a D.C.L. diploma ; and
Dublin	LOCATION	brought up the rear in
1892	DATE	by append - ing Litt.D , to the list .

		It has often been said , and with good reason , that had
Martineau	PERSON	stood within the pale of the English church he would have been made
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even English churchmen , as well as dissenters , have called him the foremost philosophical and religious thinker of his time .

		But with British con - servatism and British prejudice to contend against , the wonder is not so much that he was late in attaining such recognition as he finally enjoyed , as that he attained it at all .

		The extent of his influence and the perma - nent value of his work are undoubtedly out of all proportion to the honors he reaped while alive .

		Most gratifying was the tribute of `` reverence and affection '' paid to him on his eighty-third birthday in an address signed by a host of men of renown in learn - ing and in public life , both in
Europe	LOCATION	and in
America	LOCATION	.

		The signatures , though somewhat hastily gathered , numbered six hundred and fifty .

		The noble and touching reply to this address deserves quotation here in full , but unwillingness to trespass too greatly on edi - torial courtesy forbids , and to present the re - sponse in an abridged form were almost a sin .

		We can not , however , close this inadequate notice of a permanently valuable work without offering the reader a taste of
Martineau	PERSON	's ex - quisitely finished literary style .

		His letters lend themselves most readily to purposes of illustration .

		Dignified modesty and courtly grace distinguished them in a marked degree .

		To the Rev.
Paul Revere Frothingham	PERSON	he wrote , in
March , 1893	DATE	, a letter highly char - acteristic of his attitude in denominational matters . ''

		This
summer	DATE	will probably draw joa for a time into the great vortex of the
Chicago	LOCATION	meeting of the waters , -- the vast sweep of which , I most confess , rather terrifies than exalts mj imagination .

		I can place as little trnst in saeh ' Parliaments of all Reli - gions ' as in an
Ecamenical Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		All theological assemblies that I have ever attended , or distantly ob - served , have created more differentiation than anion .

		It is the unspoken religion that lies beneath all words , in 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, which we are one ; and it passes the wit of man to define without separating .

		Whatever temporal benefits may accrue from a concentrated exhibition of the industry and arts of all nations , I can not be sanguine in my ex - pectation of its spiritual result . ''

		A quiet humor , of which he not infrequently showed himself master , lights up the following , written from
Berlin	LOCATION	, where he spent a semester of study in 1848-49 .

		Frequenters of German university lecture-rooms will give it an appre - ciative reading . ''

		I have heard Neander lecture , though I have not met him in private ... His lectures are interesting from their matter , and -LSB- from -RSB- the neatness approaching to elegance of expression , somewhat diffused , however , and delivered in a manner so peculiar as to defy con - ception .

		A little shy-looking man , with a quantity of black hair , and eyes so small and overshadowed by dark brows as to be invisible , slinks into a great lecture - room ; steps up to his platform ; but instead of taking his professor 's chair , takes his station at the corner of his tall desk , leaning his arm upon the angle , and his head upon his arm ; with his face thus banging over the floor , and pulling a pen to pieces with his fingers , he be - gins to rock his desk backwards and forwards on its hind edge with every promise of a bouleversement , and talks smoothly , as he rocks , for his three-quarters of an hour , without a scrap of paper ; quoting authorities , chapter and verse , and even citing and translating longtsh pas - sages from ecclesiastical writers ; and finishing every clause by spitting , in a quiet dropping way upon the floor , as if to express the punctuation .

		When the clock strikes , the demolition of the pen is just complete , and he slinks out of the room without apparently having once been conscious that anybody was present . ''

		Professor
Upton	PERSON	's survey of
Martineau	PERSON	's philosophical work is , from its brevity , neces - sarily somewhat cursory , and may well be sup - plemented by Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's careful , though less comprehensive , study .

		Four portraits of Mar - tineau accompany the text , the latest showing him in his ninety-fourth year ; but the fine face still wears much of the wintry grace of unenfeebled age .

		A New History of German Literature .

John G. Robert	PERSON	- son 's '' History of German Literature '' was received with more than ordinary interest , for , excepting
Francke	PERSON	's '' German Literature as Determined by Social Forces , '' no English book of similar scope has appeared .

		ful examination .

		In all that belongs to th & technique of book-making , there is no oppor - tunity for adverse criticism .

		A taseful binding , clear type , and good paper make the book at - tractive ; while a table of contents , marginal catch-words , and an excellent index , the latter distinguishing by heavy type between detailed treatment and incidental mention , supply all the aid needed for convenient and ready reference .

		Turning now to the subject-matter itself , the question of proportion first suggests itself ; and , in this connection , a detailed statement of what Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	has given us is in order .

		An Introduction of ten or twelve pages deals in a general way with the relation of German to other literatures , and seeks to establish '' in how far divergences in the evolution of Ger - man letters are to be ascribed to national tem - perament , in how far to accidents of social or political history . ''

		The balance of the book , something over six hundred octavo pages , is then divided into five parts of varying length , each subdivided into separate chapters .

		The first part , dealing with the Old High German period , is quite brief , -- only thirty-three pages j the Middle High German and Early New High German periods are somewhat more fully treated , -- one hundred pages being given to the former , and to the latter ninety .

		The four - teen chapters of Part Four devote one hundred and seventy-five pages to the
Eighteenth Cen	ORGANIZATION	- tury ; while fullest of all is the treatment of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, in sixteen chapters , con - taining two hundred and thirteen pages .

		This arrangement is commendable .

		Most of the standard works in German end with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's death , or , like
Meyer	PERSON	's recent work , devote a stout volume to the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	alone .

		The general reader thus finds what is of the greatest contemporary interest untouched , or so exhaustively treated that , apart from any question of the perfect mastery of the foreign idiom needed to consult such works , he is de - terred from undertaking the task .

		Equally commendable is the brevity with which the Old High German period is treated .

		Monuments like the Hildehrandslied and the
Heljand	LOCATION	are given their due importance , but Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	properly appreciates , without under-estimating , this early literature .

		His con - clusion is worth quoting . ''

		It is in no sense a great period ; with the excep - tion of a few fragmentary verses ... Old High Ger - man literature has little or no poetic worth ... The interest which it possesses for us to-day is not literary but linguistic . ''

		It may seem unnecessary to emphasize this point .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 13 bat BO many historians of literatare have nn - duly exaggerated the importance of this period , as the survival of epoch-making centuries , that the student is often in danger of gettiog a wrong perspective .

		In the arrangement of his subject-matter Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is not always quite so happy , though that certainly is a very difficult thing .

		The separate chapters in each division of the book deal with different movements , or some - times with a single work or author ; and this arrangement is , of course , logical .

		But there seems to be a lack of sufficient emphasis on social and political tendencies , a failure to make clear the character of each trend or school and its relation to what came before and what fol - lowed it .

		It hardly seems that the student would get from the book as definite an idea of the various movements and the organic develop - ment of German literature as , for example , Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's '' Primer '' gives of the English .

		The author 's attitude is defined in the concluding sentence of his Introduction , summing up , as it does , the whole preceding discussion . ''

		Jast as the histori & n of French literature mast keep coDst & DtlT in view the social background , or as English literary history must take account of the nat - oral enterprise and independence of the Anglo-Saxon race , so German literatare must be regarded preemi - nently as the literature of subjectivity and individ - nalism . ''

		Now the general troth of this may be frankly admitted , yet it is equally true that various infiuences have effected not merely individuals but whole periods and all the writers of a given epoch , -- as , for example , the Storm and Stress movement .

		This movement is frequently re - ferred to as something definite and well under - stood ; but in his chapter on it Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	describes it only as '' another expression for youthful vigor , '' and characterizes it as the period of '' genius . ''

		which owed its tendency and peculiar stamp to the influence of the ideas and work of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		This is quite inadequate .

		Other allusions indicate the au - thor 's clear perception of the other features of this movement , but all of these should have been brought together into one clear presenta - tion of its nature and scope .

		It is perhaps along this same line that what seems the greatest fault of the work is to be found ; its perusal fails to give definite and clear impressions of the works described .

		There is too much of general statement and abstract criticism , too little direct analysis of the litera - ture in question and of the appeal it has made to the author : himself .

		Thus , for example , in the treatment of
Schiller	PERSON	's ``
Maria Stuart	PERSON	, '' the old point that the poet has not utilized the political situation is urged .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	certainly is familiar with the poet 's statement implying his purpose to write a tragedy of hu - man passion , and knows that he intentionally passed over the political elements , finding in his historical background simply a check upon his imagination .

		When thus interpreted , the stric - ture that
Mary	PERSON	's death ' * is an accident , not a necessity '' is not well founded , for the issue is distinctly the result of her own action in the drama .

		In similar fashion , tiie analysis of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Jphigenie avf Tavris misses the central thought that gives unity to the whole plot , -- Iphigenie 's belief that
Diana	PERSON	has protected her in order that she may return to
Greece	LOCATION	and atone the guilt of her race .

		Without due em - phasis npon this , the student gets no clear idea of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's plot , and thus wholly misses much of the significance of what onr author justly considers '' the most artistically perfect , the most spiritnal , of all the poet 's writings . ''

		One further illustration of this lack of clear presentation of vital issues .

		In speaking of
Lessing	ORGANIZATION	's great controversy with
Goeze	PERSON	, Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	simply says that '' the Fragments discussed religious questions in a rationalistic spirit '' with which
Lessing	PERSON	sympathized ; he then mentions only by title the writings called forth in the controversy .

		Now this is an insuf - ficient treatment of a struggle in which
Lessing	PERSON	finally vanquished the literalism of dogmatic Lutheran orthodoxy and reasserted Luther 's great principle of individual inquiry .

		The close relation of this straggle to y ^ aihan der
Weise	PERSON	is also not suggested ; and certainly that poem stands for something more than `` lofty humanity and wise tolerance . ''

		Professor

		From this latter point of view one additional feature of the work merits unqualified approval , -- namely , the references in the foot-notes to the works consulted and to the editions used ; also the extracts that are incorporated in the text .

		As far as possible ,

		The extracts from Old and Middle High German are also literally rendered into modern German in the notes , the author 's purpose being to furnish a glossary rather than a translation .

		That he did this is additional evidence of that sense for style that characterizes the whole work , and every good teacher will certainly agree with him that this method is better adapted to en - able the reader '' to appreciate the meaning and poetic value of the extracts '' than any English translation that could be offered .

		on Human IiiBEKTY . ''

		While the collection and publication of the early anti-slavery writings of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	must rejoice every lover of human lib - erty , it is a matter for sincere regret that the edition in which these contributions to the great cause of freedom are issued should be a limited one .

		For if ever the thinking people of the
United States	LOCATION	and , more particularly , those among them who direct the thought of their fellow-citizens , needed just such fundamental statements of right and wrong and the true glory of nations , it is in this very day when the evil of the world is masquerading once more in the guise of a '' higher morality . ''

		More than one reader who has strayed into the dim and littlekuown regions of our national history just before and during the war with
Mexico	LOCATION	has been struck with the extraordinary resem - blance between the protest and apology of con - * The Anti -
Slavebt Papers of James Russell Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		flicting political parties in that day to those in this .

		Many , too , seeing that the Mexican war has not resulted in unmixed evil , and that the conquests it made have not wholly reacted against the march of civilization , argue thence that the protestants of this day are also mere carping critics , stumbling blocks in the path of progress , as those were who fought against the admission of
Texas	LOCATION	and the taking over by conquest of lands from the weak republic to the south .

		It requires the unflinching courage and youthful enthusiasm of so true a man and so forceful a writer as
Lowell	LOCATION	to puncture such fallacies .

		One realizes that the wrong of those days has made easier the commission of wrong in these ; that the eternal heresy of doing evil that right may come was buttressed anew ; that the only too human notion that success is the test by which the worth of men 's deeds may be weighed was given an authority which gains in these days because it stands as a precedent .

		In
Lowell	PERSON	's own majestic phrase , one sees anew `` Truth forever on the scaffold , Wrong forever on the throne . ''

		It is pleasant to learn from the brief un - signed introduction to the present reprint of these anti-slavery papers that they came to be written through the influence of that gentle and God-fearing woman ,
Maria White	ORGANIZATION	, to whom
Lowell	PERSON	had just before been married .

		`` Through all the earlier papers runs the fiery zeal which we are accustomed to attribute to the young con - vert .

		The implication would seem to be a just one ; for the first of the articles was written soon after
Lowell	PERSON	's marriage to
Maria White	LOCATION	, to whom , in Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's words , he ' owed all that a man may owe to the woman he loves . '

		... We have his own evidence in a letter writ - ten many years later , that his Abolitionism began in
1840	DATE	, which was the year of his engagement to Miss White . ''

		Those of us to-day who argue from woman 's increased activity in national affairs an increase with it of that instinct by which women know right from wrong and good from evil , may take fresh courage from this example .

		The papers are printed from the original manuscripts , now in the possession of Mrs.
Sydney Howard Gay	PERSON	.

		The first five were orig - inally published during
1844	DATE	in the ''
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania Freeman '' ; the rest , fifty in number , appeared from
1846	DATE	to
1850	DATE	in the `` Na - tional Anti - Slavery Standard , '' of which periodical
Lowell	PERSON	was for two years '' titular associate editor . ''

		They are now issued in two octavo volumes , bound in dark gray cartridge paper boards , with printed labels .

		The typo - graphy is simple and dignified , yet uncommonly
1903	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 15 attractive ; and paper and presswork are of the best .

		There will be a rather general disagree - ment , we fancy , with the anonymous editor 's conclusion that these writings ' • can hardly heighten
Lowell	PERSON	's literary reputation . ''

		But however this may be , assuredly they can not fail to enhance his reputation as a lover of his kind .

		What this signifies
Lowell	PERSON	has himself set down in no conciliatory language in his estimate of
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, when he says : '' What has Freedom to thank
Daniel Webster	PERSON	for ?

		What has Peace ?

		What has Civilization ?

		What has that true ConserTatism , which consists in bringing the earth forward and upward to the idea of its benign Maker ?

		In one word , how is God the better served , how are heaven and earth more at one for his having bestowed upon this man that large ntteranee , that divine faculty of eloquent speech ?

		How was man made in the image of God , save that the capacity was given him of being an adequate representative on earth of some one of the attributes of the Great Father , and His loyal ambassador to man ? ''

		In the literary sense it is interesting to trace in these papers the germs of thought which went into
Lowell	PERSON	's great poems of freedom and de - mocracy , culminating in the '' Commemoration Ode . ''

		Upon these writings in prose it is known that
Lowell	PERSON	set comparatively small estimate ; yet it is certain that here he was sowing the seed of which the poems were only the harvest .

		Here , inspired by the love of woman broad - ened out into love of that mankind of which she has always been its fairest exemplar , were the beginnings of the close adhesion to prin - ciple before party which made his later in - ternational services to the English-speaking peoples possible .

		From this source , too , as the editor notes , came the harvest of the ''
Bigelow Papers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		and the humor and fun of those had its origins in the wit and sarcasm of these .

		It is curious proof of the growing conformity of the American nation that the language of
Lowell	LOCATION	here is the language of the most radical of the opponents of the imperialistic system that is growing upon us , -- and this in the face of the editor 's perfectly accurate comment that
Lowell	PERSON	`` was , in fact , surprisingly free from radicalism . ''

		At the very outset of his subject , in the first of the papers , bearing the non - committal title '' A Word in
Season	DATE	, '' there is a just estimate of the attitude of the conform - ing world toward the radical .

		Lowell writes : '' A good t * st for deciding the soundness of any moral stand which a man has taken is the amount of opposition it excites .

		Pure truth is poison to the mere natural man , as he is strangely called , -- that is , to man in the unnatural state to which ages of subservience to policy and compromise with wrong have reduced him .

		With this superinduced and adulterated nature , truth has no sympathy , and can not assimilate .

		Society as then constituted sees that either it or they must perish .

		If the reformers are madmen or fanatics , Society will be the last to call them by either of these names .

		They are its choicest weapons against sane reformers , and their edge would be blunted by using them too in - discriminately .

		A madman will prove himself to be such without any extraneous help ; but when the re - former has taken his position in the commanding citadel of some indestructible truth , then the old battering - rams must be brought out again , the old swords sharp - ened and furbished up , and the startled spirit of the world can find room in its dainty mouth for obloqay and denunciation . ''

		It is small wonder that the reformer of to - day can find inspiration in these words of a reformer of the past .

		The theme of the col - lection is something greatly broader and deeper than the mere abolition of chattel slavery in the southern
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The aim of the true Abolitionist , ''
Lowell	PERSON	writes in the first of his contributions , '' is not only to put an end to Negro slavery in
America	LOCATION	: he is equally the sworn foe of tyranny tbronghont the world . ''

		There is no delusion in
Lowell	LOCATION	's mind about this question of tyranny ; and the cant of Anglo-Saxonry , already rife in his early days , seems to him to cloak a tyranny rather worse , if anything , that the ordinary sort .

		He says : `` The Norman barons -LRB- a race of savages , strong ehiefly in their intense and selfish acquisitiveness , to whom our Southern brethren are fond of comparing themselves -RRB- looked upon their Saxon serfs as mere cat - tle , and indeed reduced them as nearly as might be to that degraded level by their cruelty .

		Yet these very serfs were part and parcel of that famous
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race , concerning whom we have seen so much claptrap in the newspapers for a few years past , espe - cially since the project of extending the area of free - dom has been discussed and glorified . ''

		Did space permit , it could be shown that the Declaration of Independence stood with
Lowell	PERSON	for a declaration of principles -- not an iridescent dream clad in glittering generalities . ''

		Destiny ' '' he regarded as a specious syn - onym for expediency , and he hated expediency .


Washington	LOCATION	's warning against Europeanizing influences was still to him a real warning .

		He had no delusions respecting the character of American republicanism or democracy , and he writes with scorn of '' a large class of persons who seem to consider that the tendency of all republics is toward anarchy . ''

		When the
Church	ORGANIZATION	allies herself with the conservatism that wishes to keep things as they are , rather than cooperate with those who seek to have the world as it ought to be .

		no respect for '' established institutions '' keeps him silent .

		The evils that must come when

		MORMONISM AND ITS FOUXDER .

		* Without doubt ,
Abu Sufian	PERSON	marvelled how the crude practices and absurd pretensions of Mohammed could impose upon such an intelli - gent age as that in which he lived .

		So must the success of every movement that builds upon the superstition and the credulity of men cause the more rational members of the race to won - der and grow impatient .

		But that such move - ments did succeed in the nineteenth century , and are still succeeding in the electric-lighted dawn of the twentieth , is not of itself ground for discouragement .

		The fact shows only that there are still great numbers in even the most enlightened nations who are themselves far from sharing in the general illumination of their land and age .

		The gauge of advancing civil - ization is not the entire suppression of such movements , but their gradual restriction .

		In the face of
Dowie	ORGANIZATION	's
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	and other less patent delusions of the past decade , the success of the prophecy of
Joseph Smith	PERSON	, Jr. , is not incomprehensible .

		There are other elements involved besides the inherent gulli - bility and ignorance of the masses .

		Mr.
Linn	PERSON	is unfortunate in opening his valuable book upon the Mormons with a chapter of very doubtful validity on the persistence of super - stition .

		The Focndbr of Mobmonism .

		A Psychological Study of
Joseph Smith	PERSON	, Jr. .

		By
I. Woodbridge Riley	PERSON	.

		With an Introductory Preface by
Qeorge Trumbull Ladd	ORGANIZATION	.

		New ITork :
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the relative success of the propaganda should be based on the number of missionaries and the population of the countries visited .

		It is sufficient for explanation of the success of Mormonism to admit that there are in both Anglo-Saxon countries great numbers suscep - tible to the appeals of the grossest superstition * and of the most irrational cupidity .

		It is certainly difficult for any American to - treat the history of Mormonism without pas - sion , and Mr.
Linn	PERSON	can not lay claim to having done so .

		If Mormonism were merely a systena of beliefs , even though grossly superstitious , it ought to be possible for an enlightened citizen to depict it impartially .

		But involving , as it confessedly does , opposition to our government and violation of our standards of social moral - ity , it seems almost necessary to depatriate oneself in order to treat the subject dispassion - ately .

		So , while Mr.
Linn	PERSON	must be convicted of manifesting prejudice against the institution he describes , it is hard to blame him for it , es - pecially since it appears that he gives a full hearing to both sides and bases his account in large measure upon esoteric Mormon sources .

		Mormonism is a system of religious and of socialistic beliefs and practices .

		It must be studied not only from the standpoint of com - parative religion , but also from that of soci - ology , and , as Mr.
Kiley	PERSON	thinks , from the standpoint of psychology as well .

		Mr.
Linn	PERSON	has undertaken to give such an outward chron - icle and account of the origin and growth of the institution .

		His sources are chiefly the Mormon journals , the diaries and biographies of their leaders , their religious books , and the accounts of various inside authorities , supple - mented by the accounts of certain seceders and of
United States	LOCATION	documents .

		His reference to his sources is constant and entirely adequate .

		No vital statement regarding belief or deed lacks confirmatory citations , mostly from Mor - mon sources .

		Mr.
Linn	PERSON	has not gone so far in this respect as Mr.
H. H. Bancroft	PERSON	, who permitted Mormon leaders to dictate bis account in the main , giving qualifications almost wholly in foot-notes .

		And of course Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	, who was writing a history of
Utah	LOCATION	, does not devote so much space to the beginnings of the sect as does Mr.
Linn	PERSON	.

		His '' Story of the Mormons '' ought to be a definitive history of the sect down to the time of the migration to
Utah	LOCATION	, at least for non-Mormon readers .

		There is not much in it that is new , but it takes a middle path between those unfortunate accounts that have appealed to the prurient public taste for '' un -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 veiling '' the grosser mysteries of polygamy , and the official Mormon histories with their intolerable pretense of sanctimony and injured innocence .

		The author is strongly convinced of the foundation of the Book of Mormon upon Spaulding 's '' The Manuscript Found , '' and of the share of
Sidney Rigdon	PERSON	in purveying this manuscript to
Smith	PERSON	.

		He furnishes some evi - dence confirmatory of the position of
Howe	PERSON	on this subject , but nothing conclusive .

		Perhaps the most effective portions of Mr.
Linn	PERSON	's work are those in which he shows the dishonesty and inconsistency of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's career and pretensions by quotations from - the pro- phet 's own utterances .

		Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	's account of the beginnings of Mormonism , for instance , does not betray the fact that the original Mor - mon Bible declares explicitly against polygamy , and that the '' revelation '' favoring this insti - tution was an afterthought to support
Smith	PERSON	's own conduct and that of some of his compan - ions .

		Thus also Mr.
Linn	PERSON	points out the em - barrassing position in which the Mormon church and society are placed by the '' revelations '' direct from God , proclaiming the uprightness and trustworthiness of various members of the church who afterwards fell away and exposed the evil and corruptions of the body they had left .

		Mr.
Linn	PERSON	is too much concerned with the attempt to explain the '' miracle '' of Mormon success on the basis of human gullibility and superstition .

		He fails to give sufficient weight to the socialistic and communistic fascinations of the Mormon plans .

		Neither does he take fairly into consideration the immense advan - tage the Mormons gained by keeping on the advancing border of settlement and civiliza - tion .

		By so doing they appealed to the rest - less , the dissatisfied , and the adventurous , while at the same time they profitted by the generosity of the government in the bestowal of the public domain .

		And finally , Mr.
Linn	PERSON	forgets that seventy years are but a moment in the history of institutions and societies and re - ligions .

		He does , however , not * that Mor - monism can not stand still and persist ; that it does not draw adherents from its immediate neighbors ; and that the restriction of the public domain is likely to reduce greatly -- has , indeed , already reduced -- the additions from foreign countries .

		These are considerations which may warrant the expectation of a different develop - ment for Mormonism by the time it completes its first century .

		Although one may question , in the case of another author , the value of a list of five hun - dred titles , paraded as `` authorities consulted , '' the absence of a well-digested brief bibliog - raphy is a serious defect in Mr.
Linn	PERSON	's book .

		Mr.
Riley	PERSON	's psychological study of '' The Founder of Mormonism '' transfers the prob - lem from the field of comparative sociology and religion to that of pathology .

		The point of view makes it easier to be dispassionate , although to the devout Mormon the very point of view itself must seem hostile .

		Mr.
Riley	PERSON	shows , and without difficulty , that
Joseph Smith	PERSON	, Jr. , was pronouncedly neurotic .

		His ancestrygives a forecast of what bis life developed .

		In youth he suffered from epileptic attacks , the type being diagnosed with much acuteness by Mr.
Riley	PERSON	as '' transitional . ''

		With maturity , the epileptic seizures disappeared ; but ego-mania and sen - sualism manifested themselves until , in the latter part of his life , '' psychic coordination had disappeared , and heredity had passed down those abnormal tendencies that mark the de - generate . ''

		Only in a supplement does the author take up the question of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's mes - meric or hypnotic power and practice .

		How - ever , the evidence of his having exercised this sort of control over individuals and audiences is conclusive .

		It is indeed difficult for anyone to approach the subject of Mormonism without discussing the problem of the sources of the
Book of Mormon	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is very far from the scope of Mr.
Riley	PERSON	's inquiry , yet he goes aside from his main purpose to examine the subject fully in Chapters IV .

		and V. , -- `` The Sources '' and '' The Author 's Mentality . ''

		While it is shown that
Smith	PERSON	's environment was just such as was needed for the production of religious delu - sions , there is an entire failure to explain the issuance of the language of the Book of Mor - mon from such an illiterate mouth as that of
Joseph Smith	PERSON	, Jr. .

		As to direct evidence intro - ducing
Rigdon	PERSON	as a connecting link between
Spaulding	PERSON	's `` Manuscript Found '' and
Smith	PERSON	's translation of the Golden Plates , Mr.
Riley	PERSON	is quite right in calling it '' a drawn battle '' be - tween the Mormons and the anti-Mormons .

		But his conclusion against such a connection is based upon three propositions , all of which are weak or more than weak . ''

		There is no sim - ilarity between the
Honolulu	LOCATION	MS. of Spauld - ing 's Indian migration story and the Mormon Bible . ''

		This no one claims , since the Hono - lulu MS. is plainly not the '' Manuscript Found , '' which , it is claimed , served as the basis for the Mormon Bible . ''

		The style of 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the Book of Mormon is just what might be expected of
Smith	PERSON	, and tallies with his other synchronous writings . ''

		There is not sufficient evidence that
Smith	PERSON	produced independently any of the writings attributed to him , but on the contrary it is probable that
Rigdon	PERSON	wrote or edited most of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's `` revelations '' and other writings .

		`` The style of the Book of Mormon is not that of
Rigdon	PERSON	, and
Rigdon	PERSON	would not have lent himself to a fraud . ''

		The style is in any case an assumed style , and
Rigdon	PERSON	was scholar enough to assume it , while
Smith	PERSON	was not .

		Moreover ,
Rigdon	PERSON	was
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's willing tool , held , perhaps , by hypnotic control .

		Mr.
Riley	PERSON	's work contains an excellent bib - liography , and is interesting both for its in - dependent spirit and for its attempt to apply psychology in a scientific manner to the inter - pretation of historical and anthropological problems .

		It is the philosophy of the free spirit that has given no host - ages to the conventional life , and that seeks to divest from their adventitious trappings the fundamental verities of existence .

		If we can do this , and look the world squarely in the face , and realize that the subjective factor must play its part in the game , we shall find that it is a good world after all .

		In other words , he displays shrewdness in getting at the heart of life 's problems , irony in his treat - ment of them , and zeal in his warfare upon their adjuncts of insincerity or hypocrisy .

		Courage is not enough to make men glad For laughter when that laughter is itself The tribute of recriminating groans ; Nor are the shapes of obsolescent creeds Much longer to flit near enough to make Men glad for living in a world like this ; But wisdom , courage , knowledge , and the faith Which has the soul and is the soul of reason -- These are the world 's achievers .

		Mr.

Poe	ORGANIZATION	will indicate . ''

		The ' * Poems '' of Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	inelade the contents of two previous volumes , to - gether with a new collection entitled `` Italian Rhap - sody , and Other Poenos . ''

		This - ` Italian Rhapsody '' is the finest of the new pieces , and may be illustrated by the following group of stanzas : '' Name me a poet who has trod thy soil ; He is thy loTer .

		ever hastening back .

		With thee forgetting weariness aad toil .

		The nightly sorrow for the daily lack .

		```` iqa `` iied of thy sonl , aad aot aa'Aiab stua ' '' This last touch tells us what Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	thinks of the needless warfare that has blackened the history of the last few years .

		He has a very definite notion of the real nature of '' the white man ' 8J .

		bnrdeD , '' a `` the following lines attest : '' What is the White Haa'a baidea -- Tha hardsa of his aoac That aaee waa ' Peaee aad Jaitiee ; The Weak bende the

		The Death of Sir
Launcelot	PERSON	, and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Cond ^ Benoist Pallen	PERSON	, is a much more satis - factory volume than the one which we reviewed a year or so ago .

		There are passages of really fine inspiration and glowing beauty , yet in a broad senae the work is imitative -- of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and others .

		These are the opening lines of the opening poem : '' At Canterbary seven yean s monk Sir
Launcelot	PERSON	had abode .

		For
Arthur	PERSON	passed .

		And all the goodly fellowship of knights Broken and scattered through his mighty sin With Goinevere .

		be songht to porge his guilt By prayers and fasting and the biting scourge Withia the holy life , till chastened love .

		Freed from the clogging dross of earthly | Leap a shooting flame upward to Heaven . ''

		20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, The last of these lines illustrates Mr.
Fallen	PERSON	's chief fault .

		He either has an incurably defective ear , or is inexcusably careless .

		It would have been so easy to write '' Leap like a shooting flame upward to Heaven . ''

		We should set this down for a mere slip in proof - reading , were it not that similarly defective lines are of frequent occurrence .

		The opening poem is followed by a series of quatrains '' To
Omar Khay	PERSON	- yam , '' of which one example may be given . ''

		Knowledge may reach from shining star to star , Enthroned on three-winged
Satnrn	PERSON	sit afar , And still as distant he from Wisdom 's house As when it beat against this lower bar . ''

		The burden of this poem is the emptiness of skep - ticism to him who views life from the calm haven of the Catholic faith .

		The following fine sonnet pictures the shame that has come to us as a nation in our dealings with
Spain	LOCATION	and its possessions : '' We gave a solemn pledge , and called on Heaven To hear ; our arms , we swore , were Freedom 's own .

		Our valour sprung from her chaste bosom , given To Freedom consecrate , and her alone ; To Freedom 's cause for ever , and her levin We forged upon the footsteps of her throne ; Her sword unclasping from her zone , She placed within her hands , and blessed us shriven . ''

		O solemn mockery of her holy trust !

		Our troth forgot and slaked our noble zeal , Onr brittle honour shattered in the dust !

		A riotous people drunk with
Conquest	ORGANIZATION	's lust .

		In bacchanalian rout we onward reel , And ` gainst her turn her own ensanguined steel . ''

		The poets , at least , remain true when others fail us , and the future historian will turn to them , rather than to the time-serving political writers of the hour , for the just estimate of the present dark period in our national annals .

		Mr.
John McGovern	PERSON	is an old-time journalist of
Chicago	LOCATION	who has essayed various forms of literary composition , and is the author of at least one strik - ing piece of fiction .

		The '' Poems '' which he has just collected into a little book are evidently the product of occasional impulse rather than of set poetic purpose , and include the work of upwards of a score of years .

		Short pieces in blank verse make up the greater part of the collection .

		We select the very last thing in the volume , this descrip - of sunshine after storm : '' The storm recedes , the snn shines out , the clouds .

		Like fallen fortresses , their portals ope Before the flight of earthward-hurrying beams -- And lo I the couriers with their victory I The music of the herd comes o'er the mead In homely cow-bell tones , as rude to-day As in Pan 's time .

		The clover-synod kneels -- Each tiny bishop 's mitre lit with gems -- And silken rustles fill the aisles of corn , As though the wives of modern Pharisees Passed to their public prayer .

		Behind a gorge Of ether icebergs , Hope , at azure loom , In warp of san-rays with a woof of rain , Arches her rainbow web upon the black That curtains all the east , where crowds the storm . ''

		This is finely imagined , and does not suffer from what is the chief fault of Mr.
McGorem	PERSON	's writing -- the tendency to strain after effects and to indulge in over-ornamented language .

		It is rather for the excellence of their intentions than for any poetic merit they possess that we quote the following lines on ''
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	'' from Mr.
Dayton Ervin	PERSON	's '' The Hermitage and Random Verses . '' ''

		Decked with rare jewels , wealth at her command , Her stately bearing stands them all in awe .

		How proudly flash her cold gray eyes , with hand Upon the helm of state , the queen of law !

		The pride of self is written on her brow ; Those tell-tale life-marks on her handsome face Are where her broken promises made trace : This is
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	as she is now . ''

		In olden days a young fair maiden stood , The rich embodiment of strength and youth ; Her sunny face emitted rays of good For all , so strong her love for man and truth .

		At her no finger pointed with distrust , For young
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	was not for lust . ''

		Mr.
Ervin	PERSON	has not the gift of song , and there is hardly a trace of poetic art in his collection of verses .

		Those who are accustomed to survey our cur - rent activity in verse-making can not fail to be im - pressed by the amount of work that comes from the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		Not much of this work is distin - guished by fine craftmanship , or has the arresting quality of enduring song , but most of it is the prod - uct of sincere endeavor , and the amount of the out - put speaks well for literary conditions in the far West .

		One of the best books that have recently reached us from this section is Mr.
Christian Bink	PERSON	- ley 's volume of '' Sonnets and Songs for a
House	ORGANIZATION	of Days . ''

		Mr.
Binkley	PERSON	's songs are creditable , and his sonnets are more than creditable , as the follow - ing example will show : '' Why linger , Love , within the vale below Amid the dews and lamps ?

		The view is wide .

		Upon the lofty Peak , and I shall guide To regions of delight none else may know .

		Green is the valley , pleasant in its flow The river with the rushes at its side .

		The meadows with their violets blue and pied And shadows that forever come and go .

		But fairer are the heights that we shall tread , Brighter the sunset splendors that uprear Their minarets of gold , the stars outspread Lordly at night .

		Then tremble not , nor fear O Love , to come : its beauty will be fled And all the joy be pain save thou be near . ''

		Mr.
Binkley	PERSON	's pieces are arranged in a sequence suggestive of '' an outline of life and a progressive criticism upon it . ''

		He further says : `` I have let the poems fall into some sort of order in an ap - proximation to what seemed to me when they were written a just and central conception of a man 's relation to his surroundings , -- arranging as it were , a few details of the story of this wrestling match of ours in the dawn . ''

		Mr.
Bailey Millard	PERSON	is another Californian poet , and his '' Songs of the Press '' recount in light vein the humors of the reportorial calling .

		This plaint of the unappreciated underling concerning the '' star writer '' will find an echo in the heart of many a budding journalist :
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 ' '' They let him sign his soroU-work and it swelb him like a bladder .

		And be thinks that he 's a genius on the write ; Bat when it comes to merit he 's not three rounds up the ladder ; For he could n't smell a story if 't was near enough to bite .

		Oh , the star , oh , the star .

		Oh , the overrated star !

		And they give him my best copy to rewrite ! ''

		There are men in every station travelling on their repn - tation , Bnt at that game he can give ` era cards and spades ; He will fall down on a story without any hesitation .

		And still keep on a-shiniog , for his glory never fades .

		Ob , the star , oh .

		the star .

		Oh , the empty-beaded star !

		He has nothing bnt bis halo , and that never , never fades . ''

		Mr.
Millard	PERSON	is also a writer of serious verse , for these songs of the pressroom and the desk make ap only about a third of his volume .

		The remaining contents reveal him as a singer of parts , whether his inspiration be the life of the open air or that which comes from books .

		His tribute to ''
Mair	PERSON	of the Mountains '' shall pay tribute to this notice . ''

		A lean , wild-haired , wild-bearded craggy man , Wild as a Modoc and as unafraid , A man to go bis way with no man 's aid .

		Yet sweet and soft of heart as any maid .

		`` Sky-loving , stalwart as the sugar-pine .

		Clean , simple , fragrant as that noble tree , A mountain man , and free as they are free Who tread the heighu and know tranquillity . ''

		There is a ringing and virile quality about Mr.
Millard	PERSON	's best verse that will produce a reaction in the most sluggish of readers .

		The cast of his thought is not pale , but ruddy with the glow of spiritual health .

		The spirit of old
New England	LOCATION	, with its land - scape , its legend , and its life of spiritual stress , breathes from the volume in which Mrs.
Elizabeth Akers	PERSON	has collected the verse of many years .

		The author has now passed her seventieth birthday , and has for more than forty years been widely known by the lines called '' Rock Me to Sleep , '' of which the authorized version is here printed , with a note de - scribing its singular fortunes .

		With this excep - tion , the contents of ' '' The Sunset Song and Other Verses '' are matter which has been hitherto unpub - lished .

		Thus we have some three hundred pages of new song , tender and true as to sentiment , and rather unusual as to its mastery of many forms of verse .

		We take for our extract the piece entitled ^ ' Cruel and Sweet . '' '' '

		Cruel and sweet , his hands reach down to hell ' -- Thus sang the Celtic bard of Love 's strong spell , '' And his wild wailing words of passionate pain Were heard by lonely rocks and moaning main '' Long , long ago , -- yet still as true they be As when they saddened first the sighing sea . ''

		His vows are as the fickle winds that pass ; His oaths are brittle as the frosted grass . ''

		The gifts he brings are made of fairy gold Which turns to dead leaves ere the day is old .

		* ' Who wears his flowery fetters , oft most bear Pain , sore denial , poverty , and care ; '' Most give np pleasure , peace , and selfish ease , For wearying tasks and thankless ministries . ''

		Often he wrongs the fondest faith and tmst And brings the proudest forehead to the dnst . ''

		He dooms to exile , or to prison cell ; ' Cruel and sweet , his hands reach down to hell . '

		-- '' Yet , O sad singer , think awhile and tell --
Keach	PERSON	they not also up to heaven as well ? ''

		Another
New England	LOCATION	singer , beloved of a past generation , is Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	, who from her
Deer Island	ORGANIZATION	home in the
Merrimac	LOCATION	still puts forth her books from year to year .

		The latest of her books is called '' The Great Procession , '' and is a collection of songs of childhood , exquisite in fancy and delightful in expression .

		Some stanzas from '' The Land of Story Books '' shall place this verdict beyond a doubt . ''

		The moment she blows ont the light And all is dark and cool about .

		And through the window quickly peers A great star sparkling in and ont .

		By foaming brooks and mossy nooka , I find the land of Story Books . ''

		Harry and
Lucy	PERSON	go with me Rollo , and boys and girls a troop , Sindbad the Sailor follows ns When in
Aladdin	LOCATION	's Cave we stoop .

		And , sometimes then we , little men .

		See dear
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	. ''

		And sinking into downy elonds Strange seems the Pilgrim going by With Great Heart , strange seems Crusoe 's face .

		And strange the Land of Nod should lie With hushing brooks and pillowed nooks So near the land of Story Books . ''

		This is as charming as
Stevenson	PERSON	at his best , and stands in marked contrast to the artificial songs of childhood that fill so many of our modern books and magazines for the young . ''

		A Reed by the
River	LOCATION	, '' which is the title of
Miss Virginia Woodward Cloud	ORGANIZATION	's volume of poems , suggests plaintive or piercing melody , with a touch of inspiration from classical themes .

		The sugges - tions are not borne out by any particular piece among the contents , bnt are realized in the general tenor of the poet 's song , which is noteworthy for its musical deliverance and its haunting sense of nat - ural beauty .

		The irregular sonnet called '' Dusk '' is an example of Miss Cloud 's most melodious and felicitous diction . ''

		Beyond the burning rhapsody of noon .

		The wind 's einsive harp-note in the trees .

		Between the sunset and the primrose noon .

		There is a rapture all nnknown of these , -- The harmony of twilight .

		Nature 's note , Prolonged , pellucid , subtler far than song .

		Bearing the lifted soul till it doth float Upon the heart of night and find it strong ; Against this bar the tides of tumult fail And waves slip back into a silent deep ; The world , beneath a white and windless sail .

		Drifts outward to the vaster sea of sleep .

		And thought , starlike , doth rise above
Time	ORGANIZATION	's shoal To find thee still -- thou starlight of my sonl ! ''

		22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, We should like to quote , for the sake of contrast , and to illustrate a very different manner of the author , '' The Ballad of Sweet P , '' which tells how Miss
Penelope Penwick	PERSON	on the Christmas eve of
1776	DATE	, beguiled the British officers at
Trenton	LOCATION	into forgetfulness of their duties until fate came upon them from across the
Delaware	LOCATION	.

		It is a capital poem , spirited and dramatic , which should prove an effective addition to the repertoire of the reciter .

		We have not had a volume from Miss
Edith Thomas	PERSON	for some years , and it is a pleasure to re - new acquaintance with so sincere and thoughtful a singer . ''

		The Dancers and Other Legends and Lyrics '' is a collection of pieces that have much of the old charm , although the note seems at times a little worn .

		We care less for the group of legend - ary narratives with which the volume opens than for the nature-lyrics and reflective pieces that fol - low .

		The two quatrains of '' Mirage '' have par - ticularly attracted our attention . ''

		Treasure the shadow .

		Somewhere , firmly-based , Arise those turrets that in cloud-laod sliine ; Somewhere , to thirsty toilers of the waste ; Yon phantom well-spring is a living sign . ''

		Treasure the shadow .

		Somewhere , past thy sight , Past all men 's sight , waits the true heaven at last : Tell them whose fear would put thy hope to flight .

		There are no shadows save from substance cast . ''

		A typical illustration of the clear-cut expression which we expect from
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	is furnished by the poem called '' Caprice of the Muses . ''

		`` Of old the Muses sat on high .

		And heard and judged the songs of men ; On one they smiled , who loitered by .

		Of toiling ten , they slighted ten , '' ' They lightly serve who serve us best .

		Nor know they how the task was done ; We Muses love a soul at rest .

		But violence and toil we shun . '

		`` If men say true , the Muses now Have changed their ancient habitude .

		And would be served with knitted brow .

		And stress and toil each day renewed , '' So each one with the other vies , Of those who weave romance or song ; ' On us ,
O Mase	PERSON	, bestow the prize .

		For we have striven well and long ! ' ''

		And yet methinks I hear the best Come murmuring down from
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	: ' They lightly serve who serve us best .

		Nor know they how the task was done I ' '' The noble poem called '' Palingenesis '' portrays the growth of the soul of man , through all the stages of evolution , to the full self-consciousness of its divine origin . ''

		Wild is the life of the wave , and free is the life of the air .

		And sweet is the life of the measureless pastures , unbur - dened of care ; They have all been mine , I upgather them all in the being of man .

		Who knoweth , at last , that the God hath dwelt in him since all life began !

		My heritage draw I from these -- I love though I leave them behind ; But shall I not speak for the dumb , and lift up my sight for the blind ?

		I am kin to the least that inhabits the air , the waters , the clod .

		They wist not what bond is between us , who know not the Indwelling God !

		For under my hands alone the charactered Past hath he laid .

		One moment to scan ere it fall like a scroll into ashes and fade !

		Enough have I read to know and declare -- my ways he will keep .

		If onward I go , or again in a fold of his garrapnt I sleep ! ''

		This is suggestive of some of the later poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and has , if possible , a higher spiritual reach and a deeper message .

		It is many years since we have had a volume of verse bearing the name of Mrs.
Hamilton-King	PERSON	, but the author of '' The Disciples '' is in no danger of being forgotten .

		We can not say that '' The Hours of the Passion and Other Poems '' is as precious a possession as the volume that enshrines the soul of
Mazzini	PERSON	and the devotion of his followers , but we can say that it deseives a hi ^ h place among the poetry of refined religious emotion . ''

		The Garden of the Holy Souls '' is a typical example of Mrs.
King	PERSON	's work , and is fortunately not too long for quotation in full . ''

		In Thy garden , in Thy garden , though the rain Fall , and the winds beat there .

		And they stand unsheltered , piteous , in the storm .

		They who were once so fair . ''

		In Thy garden of the souls , where Thou art gardener , Thou Who wast once so mild , Now pruning down to naked stems and leafless The roses that ran wild . ''

		Oh , Thy roses once waved in the wind so sweetly .

		Though thick with thorns beset ; In the morning sunshine opening , and at evening With cool dews wet . ''

		In Thy garden , where Thou walkest as a warder .

		How poor , how small they stand ; Yet once their beauty , to the hearts that loved them .

		Lighted the living land . ''

		In Thy garden , where no smile of Thine is granted , Yet keep within Thy heart , A place in Paradise for these transplanted .

		Still with Thee where Thou art . ''

		In Thy garden , in Thy garden , where Thy roses Without a thorn are sweet .

		And each poor branch in endless wreaths uncloses To kiss Thy feet ! ''

		The note of tender and exalted mysticism which is struck by the best of these poems is not unlike that which inspires the religious verse of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, and no higher praise than this could well be given .

		Mrs.
Shorter	PERSON	's new ballads , particularly '' The Woman Who Went to Hell '' and ''
Earl Roderick	PERSON	's Bride , '' are striking compositions , and have much of the true flavor of the old-time form which they seek to imitate .

		The legends are particularly fitted for this treatment , and the impression is clean-cut and deep .

		It is useless to attempt to quote from them , but the thin volume yields two lyrics sufficiently brief for that purpose , and of the two we have chosen `` The Watcher in the Wood . ''


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 2S '' Deep in the wood 's rM ; `` s8 ^ s cool I lee the -LCB- airr djuicerg glide , In eloth of ^ old , in gown of green , Hy lord and

		'T is death , the spider , in his net , AVho lures the dancers as they glide .

		A word of praise must be given to the fine frontis - piece , illustrative of the titular ballad , with which the book is adorned .

		Lady
Lindsay	PERSON	's new volume , '' A Christmas Posy , '' ie chiefly made np of carols and songs in the conventional manner and with the asaal artifieal accessories of shepherds and flocks and angeb .

		A particularly charming feature of the volume is afforded by a selection of old French Noels -LRB- with a few German examples also -RRB- , given us in both text and translation .

		What seems to us the loveliest of Lady
Lindsay	PERSON	's lyrics is that called > ■ At Eventide '' -- too long to quote , and too much an organic unity to represent by an excerpt .

		A little more than a year ago we found it pleasant to read and to gay a good word for an anonymous little book of verse called ■ ■ Heartsease . ''

		A second ▼ olame is now at hand from the same author , who now reveals her identity as Miss Lilian Street .

		It is a volume of pretty sentimental trifles , of which '' An Evening Ride '' is a good example . '

		* The day 's late light on the downland Lingers , and gleams , and glows ; The cloud-drifts harrying seaward * Magical dreams discloee . ''

		The North wind full in our faces Cuts like the chill of pain -- Yet , say .

		shall the day 's best beauty Speak to you all in vain ? ''

		Hy heart to yoar heart would whisper Some hope , if that might be -- But I pray that you hold my silence The better sympathy . ''

		Evening seems to prove the best inspiration of this writer , for it inspires not only the charming lyric just quoted , but also this equally charming sonnet : '' Acroas the fields of lavender they stole , The sweetest bells that ever called to prayer .

		Or charmed the peevish ear , or filled the soni With short forgetfulness of narrow care .

		Tbey marked the hoar when purple shadows creep ; And homing birds fly low with nesting song ; When sunset cloads athwart the heavens sweep In folds of amber light , the
summer	DATE	long .

		Sweet bells , that I shall never hear again !

		They ring for me a memory too dear .

		Of sunset hoars that held for me no pain .

		Of love-voiced birds it then was joy to hear : Hence ` neath the amber skies afar .

		I sigh For fragrant fields and childhood 's melody . ''

		It has always seemed to us that Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	has been unfairly dealt with by the critics .

		They have never forgiven him for the crime of being made Laureate at a time when greater poets were still living in
England	LOCATION	.

		Yet the appointment was on the whole fairly creditable and peculiarly dis - tinguished by a sense of fitness .

		An avowed repub - lican or a pronounced socialist -- to mention the only two really great poets among his contempora - ries -- could not well have been made the official poet of the English monarchy , and among the many possible candidates remaining , Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's claim was as good as that of most of his fellows .

		He could not help it , poor man , if he was not the peer of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	; he had been con - scientiously engaged in producing the best literature of which he was capable during a period of nearly half a century , and had to his credit , besides several prose volumes of unquestionable charm , a large body of verse that was always respectable and some - times distinguished .

		Since his occupancy of the laureateship , he has now and then rashly rushed into print , offering the public what was journalism rather than poetry , but he has sometimes risen to the occasion presented , and struck an unexception - able note .

		`` Take , for example , the quatrain called '' Winter Violets , '' the lines laid upon the bier of the late Queen at
Osborne	LOCATION	, and see if they are not both graceful and appropriate . ''

		Here are tad flowers , with wintry weeping wet .

		Dews of the dark that drench the violet .

		Thus over her .

		whom death yet more eadeara .

		Nature and man together blend their tears . ''

		These verses are found at the close of Mr.
Atistin	PERSON	's latest volume , '' A Tale of True Love , and Other Poems , '' dedicated to the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, and introduced by a preface which recalls the author 's long and steadfast friendship for our people .

		We have taken no little pleasure in the contents of this volume , a pleasure due chiefly to the two Italian poems , ''
Florence	LOCATION	'' and `` In the Forum . ''

		We reproduce the final stanzas of the latter of these poems . ''

		Here , even in the noontide glare .

		The gods , recumbent , take their eaae ; Go look , and yon will find them there .

		Slumbering behind some fallen frieze . ''

		Bat most , when sunset glow hath paled .

		And come , as now .

		the twilight hoar .

		In Taqter vaeneaeM dimly veiled I feel their presence and their power . ''

		What though their temples strew the groimd .

		And to the ruin owls repair .

		Their home , their haunt , is all around ; They drive the elood , they ride the air .

		24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, '' And , when the planets wend their way Along the nerer-aging skies , ' Revere the gods , ' I hear them say ; ' The gods are old , the gods are wise . ' ''

		Build as man may .

		Time gnaws and peers Through marble fissures , granite rents ; Only Imagination rears Imperishable monuments . ''

		Let Goth and
Gaul	PERSON	pollute the shrine , Level the altar , fire the fane : There is no razing the divine ; The gods return , the gods remain . ''

		The narrative poem which gives a title to the volume tells of a disappointed lover who goes to the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		We quote one stanza . ''

		But with the morrow 's dawn there came the tidings How that a crafty , freedom-loathing race .

		Its schemes unmasked , had come from out its hidings , And flung defiance in its suzerain 's face , Then on his open territories burst .

		Proclaiming these annexed unto its rule accursed . ''

		This is not remarkable as poetry , but it presents a political truth which the Boer partisans have done their best to obscure .

		It may well give pause to those who have traduced a nation that has fought at once for the defense of her territory and for the fundamental liberties that all men of English blood must ever hold dear under penalty of being false to their birthright .

		Mr.
Richard Askham	PERSON	is a young Englishman who visited
America	LOCATION	a few years ago , making a considera - ble stay in
California	LOCATION	, and who now publishes a small volume of poems containing a number of reminis - cences of his stay in the
West	LOCATION	.

		The volume is called '' Moods and Outdoor Verses , '' and is introduced to us by Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	in a prefatory note .

		It is a book characterized by both thought and imagina - tion , and it is pleasant to think that the inspiration of Mr.
Askham	PERSON	's song is due in part to his sojourn upon this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The poem called '' Reality '' expresses a mood that is known in the experience of every reflective mind . ''

		Rare is that blossom of sweet memory The dreamer 's vision , out of days forgot Mystically remembered and reborn In eager , active fingered , arduous days .

		Yet never to be native there again .

		`` Dream who may dream 1 Rarer the ringing act Chiming with act in perfect parallel And building up invincible success , Rounded as lies a poem on the pages And perfect as a song .

		Dream who would dream I But here 's the marble of reality .

		And dreams may go . ''

		But when the deed !

		s done .

		What is the thing accomplished ?

		Is ' t a flower , A star , a passion , this accomplished thing ?

		Something to ring forever and for aye .

		To burn and throb and blossom in God 's hand Until the ages cease ?

		Or is it but Handfuls of barren ashes and vain dust ? ''

		Mr.
Askham	PERSON	is a poet from whom we shall gladly hear again .

		Mr.
Herman Montague Donner	PERSON	's ' • English Lyrics of a Finnish Harp '' include a number of transla - tions from Topelius and Runeberg -LRB- including the `` Sveaborg `` of Fanrik Staal -RRB- , as well as the author 's original verse .

		Mr.
Donner	PERSON	has vigor , and imag - ination , and fine idealism , but the technique of En - glish versification is beyond his powers .

		A sonnet called '' Amber '' may be given for our example of his work .

		`` Once flew a frail , ephemeral , bright thing Among the pines of
Finland	LOCATION	's ancient shore .

		` Mid trembling shadows did it glance and soar Till , near some trunk too near adventuring ,
Ensnai	LOCATION	^ d was its iridescent wing By oozing gum .

		Thus , stayed for evermore .

		The spread wings glowed ; and seons passed before A pick their amber shrine to light did bring .

		`` B'en so sometimes from out the poet 's dreams , ` Mid hinted truths and half-seen similes , Some thought elusive through the shadows gleams .

		Then , seizing on it , his clear rhapsodies The bard pours round it , and , o'erjoyed , redeems A fragment of the world 's lost solaces . ''

		It is a pretense easy of penetration that would have us think of Mr.
Laurence Hope	PERSON	's collection of ''
India	LOCATION	's Love Lyrics '' as translations , or even paraphrases , of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	originals .

		The title-page admits that Mr.
Hope	PERSON	has '' collected and arranged '' these poems ; it might as well have said outright that he is their author .

		They are Indian in theme , no doubt , and Indian in their warmth and color , as well as in their sentiment and imagery .

		Possibly a. few of them have as their actual basis some folk - song or lyrical legend of the Orient .

		We have selected ' ■
Mahomed Akram	PERSON	's Appeal to the Stars '' for our illustrative quotation . ''

		Oh , silver stars that shine on what I love .

		Touch the soft hair and sparkle in the eyes , -- Send , from your calm serenity above , bleep to whom , sleepless , here , despairing lies . ''

		Broken , forlorn , upon the Desert sand That sucks these tears , and utterly abased .

		Looking across the lonely , level land .

		With thoughts more desolate than any waste . ''

		Planets that shine on what I so adore , Kow thrown , the hour is late , in careless rest .

		Protect that sleep , which I may watch no more , .

		I , the cast out , dismissed and dispossessed .

		`` Far in the hillside camp , in slumber lies What my worn eyes worship but never see .

		Happier stars !

		your myriad silver eyes Feast on the quiet face denied to me .

		`` Loved with a love beyond all words or sense ^ Liost with a grief beyond the saltest tear .

		So lovely , so removed , remote , and hence So doubly and so desperately dear I '' Stars !

		from your skies so purple and so calm , That through the centuries your secrets keepv Send to this worn-out brain some Occult Balm , Send me , for many nights so sleepless , sleep . ''

		And ere the sunshine of the Desert jars My sense with sorrow , and another day , Through your soft Magic , oh , my Silver Stars I Turn sleep to Death in some mysterious way . ''

		This lovely poem is companioned by many others of equal loveliness , and the volume is indeed treasure - ^ ^ o \ e.

		THE DIAL Briefs on Xkw ^ Books .

		When a man of an experiencing 5 * ' '' ^ ' ^ ^ ' * nature -LRB- to use
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	's phrase -RRB- jields to the autobiographic inopnlse , his book is pretty sare to be interesting , and is often instractive .

		Citizen
Greorge Francis Train	PERSON	's ' * My Life in
Many States	LOCATION	and in Foreign Lands '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is not disapfwinting in these respects .

		His career is packed fall of incident and adventure of the most diverting description ; and thoogh the lesson it teaches is not always the one he may have thought to convey , the reader can not close the book without carrying away something to pay him for the time spent in its perusal .

		Despite the author 's eccentricities , which the courts have dodared to amount to insanity , he has a winsome pononality , as the children that flock around him abundantly testify ; and his book , with all its glori - fication of the writer , is pleasantly suggestive of his personality .

		Omitting the more important features of his history , features comparatively well known to the world , we may note one or two minor indica - tions of character that please us .

		An enthusiastic admiration for
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is one of them .

		As a boy in
Waltham	LOCATION	, he first saw and heard the
Concord	LOCATION	lecturer . ''

		I will come to lecture . ''

		wrote
Emerson	PERSON	, '' for
$ 5	MONEY	for myself , but ask you for four quarts of oats for my horse . ''

		The lecture was • • Nature . ''

		It was young Train who , in
1847	DATE	, sold
Emerson	PERSON	his ticket to
Europe	LOCATION	and escorted him to the vessel .

		There is a good deal of the philosopher about Mr. Train .

		Living now on
three dollars	MONEY	a week at the
Mills Hot	ORGANIZATION	`` l on Bleecker street , which he chooses to e '' ll the
Mills Palace	ORGANIZATION	, he says , ' • Here I am more contented than I was at
Newport	LOCATION	'' -- where the expenses of his villa amounted to
$ 2000	MONEY	a week .

		His propensity for getting into trouble with the powers that be is most amusing .

		Fifteen times , he tells us , he has been in jail , without a crime .

		A tendency to estimate men in terms of dollars and cents is not unnatural in this man of material achievement ; yet he is not easily humbugged by mere display of wealth .

		The secret of his varioos successes in the world of commerce is probably found in his alertness , his Yankee ingenuity , his un - tiring energj - .

		his abounding self-confidence , and his never-failing optimism .

		The book of this railroad - builder was written with railroad speed -- dictated in thirty-five hours .

		But its marks of haste are not many ; the worst is calling
Wales	LOCATION	an island .

		When a distinctively novel and fresh treatment of an important domain of human thought is brought forward , it is proper that the attention of students other than those specially appealed to by the subject in question should be directed toward the work that promises some newer insight , some unachieved vista of a fertile regfion .

		For such reason , the book of Mr.
Gastav Spiller	PERSON	, which bears the title • ' The Mind of Man '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- , deserves an index-finger of An oriyvud imptortanee and snggestiveness .

		Mr.
Spiller	PERSON	has , unfortunately , seen fit to burden his exposition with an intelligible yet unfamiliar terminology , that may scare away many a possible reader , though doubtr less it ought not to do so .

		The dominant motive that determines the unfoldment of the chapters , as well as the terminology , is the recognition of needs m the determinants of the human impulses , thought * , and actions ; in other words , it is the study of men - tal functions that gives the starting-point and the method to the psychologist 's search .

		The variations that are composed upon this central theme , and the diversity of problems to which its expansion leads , are broad enough to warrant the sub-title , ■ ■ A Text - book of Psychology . ''

		Mr.
Spiller	PERSON	is a master in the art of introspection ; and for whatever topic that mode of analysis is well adapted to bring to light the recondite relations of mental operations , the book may be counted upon to contribute some - thing worthy , original , and interesting .

		It is in this respect that the pages frequently remind one of the spiciness -LRB- though the flavor is different -RRB- of the work of Professor
James	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Spiller	PERSON	takes little at second-hand ; indeed , his manner of disposing of the opinions of former psychologists , were it not obviously sincere , would suggest disrespect .

		Tet the literature of the topic is clearly utilised and rather better recapitulated than in any other single work .

		Whether he is considering the evolution of habits and impulses , or the scope of memory , or the roh of language , or the elaboration of the imagina - tion , or the conditions imposed by the nervous sys - tem , or the fluctuations of function in disturbed or distorted mental states , or the world of dreams , or the significance of originality , or the province of esthetics , or the paramount importance of attention in the distinctive thought-activities of man , the author carries with him the reader 's interest by the vigor of his presentation , the suggestive pertinence of his illustrations , and the clearness of his purpose .

		As these characteristics are by no means sufficiently - distinctive of any group of writers -- psychologists included -- to be regarded as commonplace , the vol - ume may be emphatically recommended as one that is likely to bring many things to many men . '

		Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	's '' The Haunts ^ ^ ^ iuL ' '' * Ancient Peace '' -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- i '' the gentle prose narrative of a Sep - tember outing taken by the four p > eople of ' * The Garden That I Love . ''

		Lamia stipulates that their pilgrimage shall be only to shrines of old
England	LOCATION	; and here , as always , her word is law with the shadowy `` I '' who is thq narrator .

		The places they visit are so vaguely featured as to defy iden - tification ; for ' < just as a rose by any other name would smell as sweet , so a slowly mouldering ruin , a village ' the world forgetting , by the world forgot , ' a humble pious parsonage , a semi-feudal castle , do not lose their charm or their dignity because the material imagination calls them by a wrong appel - lation . ''

		The conversations of the four travellers 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, range from
Shelley	PERSON	to the
Papacy	LOCATION	, but are too ami - able , not to say artificial , to stir the reader 's feel - ing .

		But that on
Gladstone	PERSON	, by way of exception , i8 pointed enough to be somewhat irritating to the general reader .

		The poetry which caps several of the conversations -- and the cheerful reader smiles in spite of himself at the amount of lugging it takes to get some of it in -- is not different from Mr.
Aus	PERSON	- tin 's other verse . ''

		If Time Would Halt '' shows his pensive-pious strain at nearly or quite its best , while '' Willowweed and Meadowsweet '' has genuine lyric flow and delicacy .

		Altogether the story moves in a tenuous , sublunary atmosphere .

		The people are not real , and can not do or say real things .

		Their ex - cursion is said to be a drive , and there is one refer - ence to `` conveyances '' and `` animals . ''

		But for any of the particularities of driving that are re - corded , these literary pilgrims might have used their wings .

		Indeed , the reader would scarcely object if they had .

		The power of the book lies in the very atmosphere of unreality which it creates .

		The reader who accepts it at all must leave the '' ephem - eral fret , fume , and turmoil of to-day , '' and enter a region where reigns a hazily poetic peace , -- not , perhaps , the
England	LOCATION	which Mr.
Austin	PERSON	describes for him with a tender dimness , but at least a region which his own mind will create for him if he will once submit to the author 's unstrenuous leading .

		A privately-printed volume of '' Mis - cellanies , '' hy Mr.
Henry Strong	PERSON	, brings together the occasional ad - dresses , papers , and other literary diversions of a man who has thought deeply upon many sub - jects , and who , without being a professional writer , has for nearly half a century brought a well - equipped intellect to bear upon many of the most serious human concerns .

		Mr.
Strong	PERSON	has the pro- fessional training of the lawyer , although he has not practiced his profession for many years .

		Con - tact with large affairs and intercourse with many of the most distinguished men of his time have ripened his judgment and given weight to his ideas .

		The contents of this volume range all the way from his casual remarks upon the opening of the cable system of street railways in
Chicago	LOCATION	to his Supreme Court argument -LRB- 1867 -RRB- ''
Ex-Relatione Riggs	PERSON	vs.
Johnston	PERSON	County '' -- a leading case of a generation ago .

		Several of the papers were pre - pared for the
Chicago Literary Club	ORGANIZATION	, the
Chicago Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and the various legal associations which he has been invited to address .

		A number of them are personal tributes , among which are noteworthy the memorial addresses upon Justice
Miller	PERSON	of the
U. S. Supreme	ORGANIZATION	bench and Governor
J. Sterling Morton	PERSON	, both of whom were intimate friends of the writer from his earliest years .

		The papers that are occupied with ethical and religious themes are liberal in their outlook and broad - minded in their conclusions .

		The open letter on the Philippine question is perhaps the most valu - able single number of the collection , and ranges A v ^ ume 0 / literary mUcellaniei .

		the writer with the convinced exponents of that fine older type of Americanism which our recent imperialistic debauch has brought into temporary disrepute .

		There is no more interesting chapter ^ ^ oidmUtien , j ^ ^ j , history of colonization in the West than that which relates to the establishment , in the eighteenth century , of the Catholic Missions on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		In the year
1767	DATE	the Jesuits were expelled from
Mexico	LOCATION	and forced to abandon the missions they had established in
Lower California	LOCATION	.

		But their work was taken up by the Franciscans , and under Fray
Junipero Serra	PERSON	-LRB- one of the most heroic characters of his time -RRB- was extended until a chain of missions was estab - lished along the whole western coast of
California	LOCATION	.

		There were ten of these missions at the time of Father
Junipero	PERSON	's death ; and the number was sub - sequently doubled .

		The mission system left its impress upon the whole history of
California	LOCATION	, and established a characteristic style of architecture which has attracted much attention of recent years .

		The late
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	made a valuable con - tribution to the historical literature of our country when she wrote of these
Calif	LOCATION	ornia missions in a series of magazine articles in
1883	DATE	; and many readers will be pleased to see her papers upon Father
Juni	PERSON	- pero and his work , the Mission Indians in
South	LOCATION	- ern
California	LOCATION	, and other related topics , gathered up and republished in '' Glimpses of
California	LOCATION	and the Missions '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with illustrations by Mr.
Sandham	PERSON	.

		-- Those who love the traditions that centre upon the mission system of that locality will wish that they might have found more extended treatment in Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	's inim - itable style , in his book entitled '' In the Footprints of the Padres '' -LRB-
A. M. Robertson	PERSON	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		All that it has to say about the
Mission Padres	LOCATION	is confined to a single chapter ; while the remainder of the book is devoted to entertaining papers upon other interesting phases of life in
San Francisco	LOCATION	at the time when the town of the '' forty-niners `` grad - ually gave place to the modern city , -- the metrop - olis of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		With the pages of his narrative evi - ^ ** t ` ffl '' d `` & ^ ' ^ dencing a painstaking capacity for minute research , Mr.
Charles Knowles Bolton	PERSON	has collated from the published histories , biographies , diaries , correspondence , and other documents of the revolutionary period , an ex - haustive array of recitals , incidents , colloquies , and anecdotes , illustrative of the point of view of the rank and file of the continental army , which is pub - lished in a volume entitled '' The Private Soldier under
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		What steps had been taken toward the organization of that army before the conflict at
Lexington	LOCATION	, how the exciting news of that and other similar conflicts was spread throughout the scattered settlements of the colonies , how that army grew , notwithstanding many obsta - cles and difficulties , and the characteristic virtues

		THE DIAL .

		2T Ame H arw S m `` Dd foibles of the men who entered the serriee , are here clearly set forth , as exhibited in the first sources of information so copionsly cited by the indastrioas writer .

		The army and navy were enforced com - petitors ; for the paasion for privateering often inter - fered with enlistments into the land forces , i ^ fac - simile copy of one of
Paul Jones	PERSON	's enlistment `` broad - sides '' of
1777	DATE	.

		contrasted with copies of other '' broadsides '' inviting enlistments into the army ; and the illustrations showing the dress , accoutre - ments , arms , and equipment of the soldiers of the line , the requisitions made for supplies for them , the orders issued for their government , and the style of money paid them and their receipts there - for , unite to furnish a vivid picture of the conditions surrounding the men who fought for Independence .

		Much of the gossip of the revolutionary field , camp , and bivouac is here conveniently and agreeably summarized .

		The temerity it takes to write any - thing more about the slums is justi - fied , and on the whole amply justified , by Mrs.
Betu	PERSON	's `` The Leaven in a
Great City	LOCATION	'' -LCB-
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is none of Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's Dickens-like pietnresqueness in the book , nor of Miss Addams 's philosophic grasp ; but the testimony to the present condition of slum-dwellers in
New York	LOCATION	is both sympathetic and expert .

		The text of the writer 's arraignment is : '' Not poverty , but the burden imposed by political corruption , is the blight of home-life in the tenement-house sections of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		She makes it painfully clear how the help - less immigrant falls into the hands of the ward boss , who gives or refuses him work , determines his moral standards , and controls his vote .

		And she lays the blame at the door of the respectable citizen , espec - ially the church-member , who allows the ward boss to be .

		The book is not a tirade , however , bat a faithful and valid account of life in the tenements .

		It admirably supplements Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's books by laying stress on the work of the women 's and girls ' clubs , and of the college settlement on Rivington street .

		Not all of the '' leaven '' is catalogued .

		Very little is told of the work of the churches , except its past inadequacy ; and even Mulberry Park is not men - tioned .

		But it is much to have given a clearer understanding of the slams , and of some of the spots therein that have been leavened .

		Mr.
James Q. Howard	PERSON	's '' History ` Awtorv ° ^ ^ ^
Louisiana	LOCATION	Purchase '' -LRB-
Calla	LOCATION	- ghan -RRB- is made up of articles origin - ally sent to the newspapers by the Press and Pub - licity Department of the
St. Louis Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, which are now collected and issued in book form '' with the approval of the Exposition Company . ''

		The style of the book is bad , and the subject-matter is partly irrelevant and partly erroneous .

		The author 's evident purpose is to exalt
Livingston	PERSON	at the expense of
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Madison	PERSON	, and
Monroe	PERSON	.

		He does not grasp the combination of circumstances that caused the cession of
Louisiana	LOCATION	to the
United	ORGANIZATION	lU-advUed Ai States , but he writes with so much assurance coupled with disparaging references to other books that he is likely to impose upon the novice .

		His most strik - ing claim is that
William Beach Lawrence	PERSON	wrote in the interest of Monroe the '' History of
Louisiana	LOCATION	'' to which ^ ' the kindly Marbois , at the feeble age of eighty-three , lent the use of his name . ''

		This state - ment is unsupported by the slightest evidence , and is preposterous on its face .

		He also claims that the famous speeches of Napoleon relating to
Louisiana	LOCATION	, contained in
Marbois	LOCATION	, were transferred bodily and without credit from
Garden	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of Treaties , '' whereas the fact is that
Garden	ORGANIZATION	wrote long after
Marbois	PERSON	, and copied Marboisi nstead of
Marbois	ORGANIZATION	's copying him .

		The speeches do not occur in the earlier work of
Schoell	ORGANIZATION	, which Garden revised and enlarged .

		As reported by
Marbois	PERSON	, they were doubt - less largely imaginary , according to the fashion of historical writing at the time , but they nevertheless accurately represented
Napoleon	PERSON	's attitode toward the subject .

		The book closes with sketebes of the foremost nine heroes of peace and war , from Wash - ington to Grant , who , in Mr.
Howard	PERSON	's opinion , '' best teach patriotism and love of country by ex - ample . ''

		N0TB8 .

		The
Irwin Press	ORGANIZATION	is the style of a Dew pnblishing coQcem reeently established in
Pittsbnrg	LOCATION	.

		The first publication of the firm is the new edition of '' Mr.
John Decastro	PERSON	, '' reviewed in our last issue .

		The complete works of
John Lyly	PERSON	, now for the first time collected , are about to be issued from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		A life of
Joseph Parker	PERSON	, the late widely-known pas - tor of the
City Temple	ORGANIZATION	, LoDdon , has been prepared by his long-time friend and associate , Dr.
William Adam	PERSON	- son , and will be issued at an early date by the
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

Richard Burton	PERSON	's three volumes of verse , '' Dumb in
June	DATE	, '' '' Memorial Day , '' and '' Lyrics of Brother - hood '' ; and also in bis volume of essays , `` Literary Likings , '' of which they are priating a new edition .

		In his forthcoming volume of `` Biographical Sketches '' Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	has made a collection of some very interesting articles which have from time to time ap - peared ia the leading English joarnals .

		Most of the men of whom he writes are those with whom he has been closely associated in public life and friendship .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish the book this month .

		A revised edition of Shakespeare 's '' Macbeth , '' as presented in the Variorum Edition , will shortly be is - sued by
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the publishers of that edition .

		The new volume will be the first to appear under the editorship of Mr.
Horace Howard Fumess , Jr.	PERSON	, the son of Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, LL.D. , the distinguished Shakespearian scholar , whose monamental work the
Variorum Edition	ORGANIZATION	is .

Furness	PERSON	to relinquish the task of editorship of future volumes in the edition en - tirely to his son , who will take up the historical plays and probably present ``

		The
New Amsterdam Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	will shortly add to their '' Commonwealth Library '' a new edition , re - printed in unabridged form from the
Andover	LOCATION	edition of
1830	DATE	, of
Harmon	PERSON	's '' A Journal of Voyages and Travels in the Interior of
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		A medical book of considerable literary interest may be expected in Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	's '' Biographic Clinics , '' to be issued shortly by
Messrs. P. Blakiston 's Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a consideration and diag - nosis of the ill-health of five English men of letters of the last century -- De Quincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Hux	PERSON	- ley , and
Browning	PERSON	.

Daniel Webster	PERSON	Hitherto Un - collected '' has been postponed until after the holidays .

Daniel Webster	PERSON	in eighteen volumes .

		The death of Mrs.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood	PERSON	, the day after
Christmas	DATE	, at the age of fifty-five , removed from the ranksof American novelists one of the most skil - ful and charming of recent writers .

		Her special subject was the romance of American history as found in Park - man and other chroniclers of the old life of the North - west -- the life in which Indians , French , and English came into such interesting relations .

		In this field Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	was a pioneer , for '' The Romance of Dol - lard '' was published in
1889	DATE	, and soon followed by `` The Story of Tonty , '' `` The Lady of
Fort St. John	LOCATION	, '' and other pleasing reconstructions of a richly romantic period .

		Her most elaborate work , and her most suc - cessful from the publishers ' point of view was the ''
Lazarre	PERSON	'' of last year .

		On the whole , Mrs.
Cather	PERSON	- wood has made a fresh and substantial contribution to our Active literature , and her death is a serious loss to letters , as well as a cause of profound grief to the many friends to whom she was endeared by a singularly gra - cious and winning personality .

		What will no doubt prove to be one of the most im - portant historical enterprises undertaken in this country of recent years is announced by the
Arthur H. Clark Co.	PERSON	of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		This work will present -LRB- mainly in English translation -RRB- the most important printed works relating to the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, from
1493	DATE	to
1803	DATE	; including also a large number of heretofore unpub - lished MSS. , gathered from various foreign archives and libraries , which have thus far been most difficult of access .

		The material thus presented will comprise explorations by early navigators , descriptions of the islands and their peoples , their history , and records of the
Catholic Missions	ORGANIZATION	, as related in contemporaneous books and manuscripts ; showing the political , economic , commercial , and religious conditions of the islands from their earliest relations with European nations to the beginning of the nineteenth century .

		The series will be edited and annotated by Miss
Emma Helen Blair	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, of the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, assistant editor of '' The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents , '' and Mr.
James Alexander Robertson	PERSON	, Ph.B. , also formerly engaged upon that work .

Edward Gaylord Bourne	PERSON	,
Professor of History	ORGANIZATION	in
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, well known as an authority on early Span - ish discoveries and colonization in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The series will include a very careful and extensive bibliography of
Philippina	LOCATION	-- the most valuable that has yet appeared , and there will be an exhaustive analytical index to the complete work .

		The edition , comprising fifty-five volumes , is limited to one thousand sets .

		The first volume will appear this month .

		BRIEFER ilENTION 51 NOTES 52 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 53 The celebration , last
December	DATE	, of
Herr Bjbmson	PERSON	's seventieth birthday was marked by the publication of much interesting matter in the Scandinavian reviews , as well as by a `` Festskrift '' made up of contributions in prose and verse by a large number of the poet 's friends .

		The matter thus brought to light includes a considerable fund of anecdote and reminiscence , from which we have thought it worth while to make a few selections for trans - lation and reproduction in these pages .


Herr Edvard Grieg	PERSON	, the composer , relates the fol - lowing incident of the old days : • * It waa Christimui ere of
1868	DATE	at the Bjoraaon in
Christiania	LOCATION	.

		They lived then in the
Roaenkrantignde	LOCATION	.

		My wife and I were , as far as I can remember , the only guests .

		The children were verr boisteroos in their glee .

		In the middle of the floor an immense
Christmas	DATE	tree was enthroned and brightly lighted .

		All the serrant-folk eame in , and
Bjomson	PERSON	spoke , beantifnily and warmly , as be well knows how to do . '

		Now yoo shall play a hymn ,
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	, ' he said , and although I did not quite like the notion of doing organist 's work , I naturally eomplied without a murmur .

		It was one of
Grundtvig	ORGANIZATION	's hymns in 32 -- thirty-two Terses .

		I re - signed myself to my fate with stoicism .

		At the begin - ning I kept myself awake , but the endless repetitioMS had a soporific effect .

		Little by little I became as ataptd aa a mediom .

		When we had at last got throogh with all the verses ,
Bjornson	PERSON	said : ' Is n't that fine .

		Now I will read for you ! '

		And so we got all thirty - two verses onee more .

		I was completely overawed . ''

		The following bit of personal address is from
Herr Frits Thaulow	PERSON	, the well-known painter : '' You were once chosen as president of the student society .

		There were wild rumors about that your op - ponents would hiss you and bombard you with rotten apples .

		In the afternoon yon paced back and forth over the threshold , and I easily understood that yon were nerTous and fearful .

		I tried to put in a eom - forting word , bat yon could n't understand it in the least .

		Your trepidation was truly artistic .

		■ It is al - ways so deneedly hard to begin , ' you said , < I most be qnite sure of my beginning -- until the sweat begins to stream from the pores , after that a speech takes eare of itself . ' ''


Herr Thaulow	PERSON	also relates the following about a festive gathering of students : '' The manager came in and announced with a lend Toice that it was past twelve .

		Then you sprang up . '' '

		Bring champagne I Now I will speak of what comes after twelve o'clock !

		of all that lies bevond the 88 THE DIAL -LSB- Jan , 16 , respectable hour for retiring !

		For the hour when fancy awakens and fills us with longings for the world of won - derland ; then the painter sees only the dim outline in the moonlight , then the musician hears the silence , then the poet after his thoughtful day feels sprouting the first shoots of the next .

		After twelve freedom begins .

		The day 's tumult is stilled , and the voice within becomes audible . ' ''

		Thus you spoke , and ' after twelve ' became a watchword with us . ''

		Many a spark has been kindled in your soul by the quiet evening time .

		But later in life , when you be - come a chieftain in the battle , broad daylight also made its demands upon you .

		Like the sun you shone upon us and made the best that was in us to grow , but 1 shall always keep a deep artistic affection for what comes • after twelve . ' ''


Herr Werner Soderhjelm	PERSON	, who writes in Swedish of the poet 's relations to
Finland	LOCATION	, is speaking of certain evenings spent with him in
Paris	LOCATION	, where both Finns and Scandinavians gathered together to recreate a bit of home beneath the alien skies of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		He who has ever been present on one of these festival occasions , such as a Seventeenth of
May	DATE	festival in some beautiful spot near
Paris	LOCATION	, where
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Jonas Lie	PERSON	, inspired at once by the glorious memories of the day and the beauty of the natural surroundings , opened the warmest springs of their poetic hearts , and poured out streams of eloquence ; and when afterwards , as the shades of night fell , all went home with
Bjornson	PERSON	, and beneath his roof his daughter sang her father 's songs , while in hushed and reverent mood we all turned to - ward the skald , as he sat there plunged in serious thought -- he , who has been present on such an occa - sion , will keep the memory as one of the few that may never be matched again upon life 's journey . ''

		When the poet purchased his estate in the Gausdal , his coming was looked forward to with mingled feelings by the good country folk of the neighborhood .


Herr Kristofer Janson	PERSON	thus tells the story of his arrival : '' His coming was anticipated with a certain anxiety and apprehension , for was he not a ' horrid radical ' ?

		The dean in particular thought that he might be a men - ace to the safe spiritual slumber of the village .

		As the dean one day was driving through the village in his carriole , just where the road turns sharply by the bridge below
Aulestad	LOCATION	, he met another carriole which was rapidly driving that way and iu it a man who , without respect for the clerical vehicle , shouted with all the strength of his lungs : ' Half the road ! '

		The dean turned aside , saying with a sigh : ' Has
Bjornson	PERSON	come to the Gausdal at last ? ' ''

		It was indeed so , and he showed his colors at the start .

		The same dean and
Bjornson	PERSON	became the best of friends afterwards , and found much sport in inter - changing genial jests whenever they met . ''

		Our remaining anecdotes are taken from a reminiscent paper by
Herr Henrik Cavling	PERSON	, who writes chiefly of the eighties when the poet was living in
Paris	LOCATION	for a considerable portion of each year . ''

		It was one of
Bjomson	ORGANIZATION	's peculiarities to go ont as a rule without any money in his pocket .

		He neither owned a purse nor knew the French coins .

		His per - sonal expenditures were restricted to the books he bought , and now and then a theatre ticket .

		One day he came excitedly into the sitting - room , and asked : ' `` Who took my five franc piece ? '

		It was a five franc piece that he had got somewhere or other and had stuck in his pocket to buy a theatre ticket with .

		It turned out that the maid had found it and given it to
Fru Bjornson	LOCATION	.

		For it seemed quite unthinkable to her that the master should have any money to take ont with him . ''

		This complete indifference of
Bjornson	PERSON	to small mat - ters sometimes proved annoying .

		In this connection I may tell of a little trip he once took with
Jonas Lie	PERSON	. ''

		The two poets , who did not live far apart , had long counted with pleasure upon a trip to
Pere Lachaise	PERSON	, where they wished to visit
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	's grave .

		At last the day came , and with big soft hats on their heads , and engaged earnestly in conversation , they drove away through
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		When they came to
Pfere Lachaise	PERSON	, and wanted to enter the cemetery , the driver stopped them and asked for his pay .

		Then it appeared that neither had any money , which they smilingly explained , and asked him in bad French to wait and drive them home again .

		But the two gentlemen with the big soft hats had not inspired the driver with any marked degree of confidence .

		He made a scene , and attracted a great crowd of the boys , loafers , and well-dressed Frenchmen who always collect on critical occasions .

		The end of the affair was that the poets had to get into their cab again and drive all the long way back without having had a glimpse of the grave .

		When they reached Lie 's lodgings .

		Lie went in to get some money , while
Bjornson	PERSON	sat in the cab as a hostage .

		Nevertheless , both poets maintained that they had had a pleasant expedition .

		A Norwegian question , which had accidentally come up between them , had made them forget all about Alfred de Musset . ''


Herr Cavling	PERSON	once asked his friend upon what occasion in his life he had taken the greatest pleasure in knowing that he was a poet .

		This was his reply : '' It was when a delegation from the Right came to my house in
Christiania	LOCATION	and smashed all the windows .

		Because when they had thus attacked me and were starting for home again , they felt that they ought to sing something , and so they began to sing , ' Yes , we love this land of ours ' ; they could n't do anything else !

		They had to sing the song of the man whom they had attacked . ' ''

		The last of our anecdotes is also related in the poet 's own words . ''

		1 had a pair of old boots that I wanted to give to a beggar .

Karoline	PERSON	had not some use for them , since she usually gave such things to beggars .

		So I took the boots in my hand , and went downstairs to ask her , but on the way I got a little worked up because I did not quite dare to give them to the beggar myself .

		And the further I went down the steps , the more wrathful I got , until I stood over her .

		And then I was so angry that I had to bluster at her as if she had done me a grievous wrong .

		But she could not understand a word of what I said , and looked at me with such amazement , that I could not keep from bursting into laughter . ''

		THE DIAL 99 g : fee Bf ^ gooKs .

		Echoes fkom the south African Struggle .

		* The two books just issued from the hands of President
Paul Kruger	PERSON	and General
Chris	PERSON	- tiaan
Rudolf	PERSON	de Wet serve to accent the evils of the censorship enforced by
Great Britain	LOCATION	during the recent war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		For Americans they contain little that is new or unexpected , while they seem to have been in many respects a revelation to the British read - ing public .

		It is readily conceivable that the conditions would be directly reversed if , say , President
Aguinaldo	PERSON	and General Luna were to publish their version of the wap for conquest in
the Philippines	LOCATION	in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		In either event it may be said that !

		the people of the
United States	LOCATION	and of
Great Britain	LOCATION	respectively have been informed con - cerning the two wars in inverse ratio to their direct interest in them -- not the most reassur - ing element in free government , nor one to make either nation welcome militarism with any joy .

		Because the American newpapers have been able to print news from
South Africa	LOCATION	denied to the British press there is , therefore , little of novelty in the volumes under discussion , nor do they alter in any respect the opinion of their authors generally held by American news - paper readers of intelligence .

		Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	is seen to be of a type little known in the
United States	LOCATION	, though his combination of evangelical religion and personal valor would not have seemed so strange to those of our ancestors who took part in
King Philip	LOCATION	's war , for ex - ample .

		Indeed , the fighting with the Kaffirs in the years following the
Great Trek	ORGANIZATION	, in which the youthful
Kruger	PERSON	, though little more than a boy , took a man 's part , is often reminiscent of the dealings of the Puritans with the Wam - panoags and
Narragansetts	ORGANIZATION	.

		General de Wet is more modern in every respect , but still with that touch of fanaticism which Calvinism , like Islam , breeds in its devotees .

		Both of the men tell their stories in Dutch , and both have had their writings translated into English by an anonvmous hand .

		Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	's narrative is evidently one of selection , much of the mate - rial at his disposal being put aside to keep his • The Mkmoiks of Pacx Kbcger .

		narrative within compass .

		It is better ordered , and written in a better style , than General de W ^ et 's .

		On the other hand , the soldier 's story of incessant fighting , though written with a dis - reo ^ ard for English idiom which often impresses the reader as a foreign accent might a listener , is easier to follow and more immediately inter - esting , in spite of its not containing the ample material for thought which inheres in the other .

		Perhaps the most impressive feature of Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	's memoirs is his unfailing belief , from the first knowledge he obtained of the British nation , that
England	LOCATION	coveted the territory of the burghers and would stick at nothing to obtain it .

		In General de Wet 's story one is continually struck with the fewness of the men composing the burgher commands ; and with these men , little disciplined as they were , ran an unexpressed contempt for the British as equal foes , much more galling , of a surety , than open boasting could
Iw	ORGANIZATION	.

		Curious reflections arise , too , when one reads in both books the constantly recurring citations of the Scriptures and the unfailing belief that the fighting men of the two Republics were under the particular care of Jehovah -- thus for once surpassing the British in one of their most salient characteristics .

		Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	's book is a sad one , -- the reflec - tions of an old and disappointed , but not em - bittered , man .

		His arraignment of his enemy is not wholly candid , but is quite as honest and fair as any presentation made against his people and policy .

		His life has been that of a pioneer , with savage men and savage beasts to conquer from the beginning , and the result shows itself in self-centering and self - sufficiency , the words being used in no invidi - ous sense .

		His was a hard school , but it can - not be said to have hardened his nature , or divested him of human sympathy .

		On the con - trary , the tone of sorrow pervading the book shows how deeply he has felt .

		It is not from these memoirs , of course , that the reader can learn how greatly indebted Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	has been to the interferences of
Great Britain	LOCATION	for his prominence in the
South African Republic	LOCATION	, except in the information conveyed between the lines .

		One discovers that every time the element in the Republic which believed in pro- gression made substantial gains in public favor , some act of the British took place at a time suitable to throw popularity once more into the hands of the reactionary element of which Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	was the natural leader .

		The figures given in the elections which elevated him to the presidency of the nation , too well known 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, to require citation here , are abundant proof of this , and support the contention of the English Liberals that a more conciliatory policy would have resulted in the elimination of Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	and his fellow-pioneers from the politics of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		The charge against Sir
Alfred	PERSON	-LRB- now Lord -RRB-
Milner	PERSON	of deliberately suppressing the portions of the conference of
May 31 , 1899	DATE	, which made for peace , are repeated and rein - forced by documentary evidence , but this is al - ready an old story to Americans .

		So , too , is the presentation as a judicial farce of the trial of Doctor
Jamieson	PERSON	and his companions in the raid , though this could have been drawn more strongly .

		The statement that it was this raid which led to the armament of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	is plain and indubitable .

		A minor detail , that it was the refusal of the Americans among the Uitlanders to cooperate with Doctor
Jamieson	PERSON	under the British flag which brought about the failure of the daring scheme , has neither con - firmation nor denial .

		Throughout the book there is complete reluctance to state anything not personally within the knowledge of the writer , leading to a marked narrowing of the discussion .

		General de Wet , also , keeps within his own personal knowledge of events , and has nothing to say of any of the causes that brought about the war .

		He entered his country 's service as a simple member of his commando , was elected to his first military office while absent from his fellows , and won his way by deeds rather than words .

		His language has not the restraint of Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	's , and he frequently denounces those among his countrymen who failed in their patriotic duty .

		He is proud of the fighting qualities shown by those burghers who did fight , and he constantly bewails the lack of military discipline and knowledge in his forces .

		A more skilful writer could have made this story one of the most engrossing ever told , but the natural modesty of the man and his eager - ness to award credit to others divest it of much of its interest .

		Setting forth his admir - ation for General
Cronje	PERSON	and his unwilling - ness to criticize him , he is none the less plain in his statement that
Cronje	PERSON	could have made his escape had he not thought , along old-fash - ioned lines , that it was disgraceful to abandon his wagon train .

		After the gain in mobility due to the inhibition of wagons as part of the burghers ' military equipment , such victories and reprisals as de Wet 's own became fully possible for the first time .

		Mr.
Kruger	PERSON	's book leaves him unreconciled to the British conquest -- less than that could not have been expected .

		General de Wet dedicates his work to '' my fellow-subjects of the British Empire , '' and concludes it with a prayer to his countrymen to be loyal to their new ruler .

		Neither expends any thought on the future ; but both quote
Bismarck	PERSON	's apo - thegm that
Africa	LOCATION	is to be
England	LOCATION	's grave , and there is nothing to indicate that they do not believe it .

		Certainly the admiration both ex - press for
Gladstone	PERSON	does not indicate too much confidence in those who have rendered his policy nugatory .

		* Within
Thoreau	PERSON	's '' Familiar Letters '' readers have gained some acquaintance with his
New Bedford	ORGANIZATION	correspondent and friend of later years ,
Daniel Ricketson	PERSON	.

		Familiar also are the bust , now in the
Concord	LOCATION	library , and the medallion portrait of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Walton Ricketson	PERSON	.

		In their city home at
New Bedford	LOCATION	, surrounded with many rare volumes and relics of literary friendships , in - cluding
Thoreau	PERSON	's spy-glass and flute , Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	, the sculptor , and his sister have prepared this memorial of their father and his most illustrious friends .

		Letters , journal - extracts , and poems are here collated , which reveal with graphic yet dignified intimacy the life of Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	in its subjective aspects and its relations with his literary associates .

		Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	once wrote of himself : `` As for myself , if you will excuse an episode of egoism , I have achieved but little , nor have I desired fame .

		I have rather been the friend of good and noted men and women . ''

		To most readers the interest of this volume will centre about the friendship with
Thoreau	PERSON	; yet the personality of Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	gleams with a constant light which is far more than a reflection of influence .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	has contributed a brief sketch of the life of this
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	scholar and nature - lover , a life rounding out more than four-score years of earnest and genial activity .

		Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	's nature was essentially that of the lover , more than the writer , of books , though he published a '' History of

		His home was a refuge for all who were oppressed , and his legal training was always devoted to their ser - vice .

		His name will be most often associated with
Thoreau	PERSON	,
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	, Al - cott , and
George William Curtis	PERSON	.

		The de - scription of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, as he approached
Brook	PERSON	- lawn for his first visit , with his slight awkward figure , his large uncouth hat , his umbrella and travelling-bag , resembling `` either a peddler or some way-traveller , '' has already been pre - served in print ; but no words can so ade - quately express that impression as the pencil - sketch by Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	here given , with sufficient hint of the cartoonist to intensify but not degrade the humor .

		The interchange of letters and visits between
Ricketson	PERSON	and
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		-- a result of the former 's enjoyment of ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' -- filled the
last eight years of Thoreau	DATE	's life , from
1854	DATE	to
1862	DATE	. ''

		I recog - nize many of my own experiences in your ' Wal - den , ' '' wrote Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	, citing his simple tastes , his secluded '' Shanty , '' his studious love of nature and her poets , and his deep devotion to the anti-slavery cause .

		He prof - fered to Thoreau an alluring invitation to visit him and the ' * haunts that your very soul would leap to behold , '' -- the
Middleboro	LOCATION	ponds whose charm was later recorded by the
Concord	LOCATION	naturalist .

		Of the score or more of letters included in this portion of the volume , some are now first published , others are already included in the '' Familiar Letters , '' but all are interesting revelations of the mental vigor and courage , the high altitudes of thought and life , main - tained by
Thoreau	PERSON	during these last years , often invalided for active work , by his con - fession '' far , far from my best estate , '' yet contented and inspiring to the end .

		There are some terse notes of announcements , and occasional longer '' genuine epistles . ''

		One misses , however , those more expansive thoughts , the utterances of his deepest mind and soul , found in the letters to Mr.
Blake	PERSON	.

		Humor of typical baldness is interspersed with serious lore , while on every page one is im - pressed by the reserve and elusiveness of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's self-revelations .

		Among significant sentences are these : `` I am engaged to Con - cord and my own private pursuits by 10.000 ties , and it would be suicide to rend them . '' ''

		The man 's interest in a single bluebird is more than a complete , dry list of the fauna and flora of a town . ''

		Sequential from the correspondence with
Thoreau	PERSON	are Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	's letters to Miss SophiaTborean , during her brother 's illness and after his death .

		Later research has convinced us that
Henry Thoreau	PERSON	was not alone a man of wonderful individuality , but that he be - longed to a family of remarkable mental and moral fibre .

		These letters from his sister , as well as a few published earlier by Dr.
Jones	PERSON	, show intellectual vigor and a courageous ac - ceptance of all life 's burdens , finding within her deeper nature ever '' a singing soul . ''

		Her detailed iterations of her brother 's patience , cheer , and `` childlike trust , '' are full of rare tenderness and heroism .

		In one of his letters to her , Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	refers to his verses , im - provised during one of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's visits to
New Bedford	LOCATION	, when , in a mood of exhilaration , and incited by a spirited tune upon the piano , the poet-philosopher executed a strange rhythmic dance , slyly stepping upon
Alcott	PERSON	's toes in his gyrations before the astonished company .

		These stanzas were later included in Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	's volume , '' Autumn Sheaf . ''

		Their imagery and suggestion accord with one 's im - aginative picture of such a scene . ''

		Like the Indian dance of old .

		Far within the forest shade , Showing forth the spirit bold .

		That no f oeman e'er dismayed ; -- `` Like the dancing of the Hoars , Tripping on with merry feet , Triumphing o'er earthly powers .

		Yet with footsteps all must greet ; -- '' Like the Fanns , and Satyrs too , Nimbly leaping in the grove , Now unseen and then in view , As amid the trees they move . ''

		A few letters from
Alcott	LOCATION	,
Channing	LOCATION	, Dr.
Japp	PERSON	, Mr.
Salt	PERSON	, and other literary friends , offer material of reminiscent value , -- in the main , memories or estimates of
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Theo Brown	PERSON	, referring to a call made by Mr.
Blake	PERSON	and himself upon Thoreau shortly before thelat - ter 's death , said : '' His talk was up to the best I ever heard from him , -- the same depth of earnestness and the same infinite depth of fun going on at the same time . ''

		Especially note - worthy and rare are two letters from the poet
Channing	PERSON	, with his unique tributes to
Thoreau	PERSON	's '' brave and generous life '' and his '' superior scribbling faculty . ''

		In the journal-extracts and the poems by Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	, included in the last portion of 4i THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the volume , one may recognize that depth of thought , that remonstrance against tawdry standards of life , that studious love for nature and the English poets -- especially
Cowper	PERSON	,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, and Gray , -- which characterized this man of strong personality who yet re - joiced to be called '' friend of Thoreau . ''

		Alcott , in his journal here cited , has a sen - tence of fine discrimination regarding the con - trasting devotions of
Thoreau	PERSON	's two friends of later life : ''
Thoreau	PERSON	has visited R. be - fore , and won him as disciple , though not in the absolute way he has
Blake	PERSON	of
Worcester	LOCATION	, whose love for T. 's genius partakes of the ex - ceeding tenderness of woman , and is a pure Platonism , to the fineness , and delicacy of the devotee 's sensibilities .

		But R. is himself , and plays the manly part in the matter , defending himself against the master 's twistiness and tough ' thorough-craft ' with spirit and ability . ''

		The poems of Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	, here printed , need the author 's confession of '' an impatience of rules . ''

		They are often infelicitous in form , but ever animated by spontaneous nature-love and religious faith .

		One is reminded of Whit - tier 's bucolics and hymns in these less perfect stanzas , which include landscape-poems and peaceful domestic scenes .

		The volume is edited with the most delicate taste and sympathy .

		Its only marked defect is the lack of an index ; for here are many side - lights and direct facts which will be of service for later reference .

		Contact with such simple and strong natures as those of Mr.
Ricketson	PERSON	and his literary friends must ever be conducive to more easeful and earnest thought , and less nervous tension of daily life .

		territories and dependencies .

		This is , in brief , the view which modern international jurists take of the present relations between the
United States of America	LOCATION	and her recently acquired insular possessions .

		Such a relation - ship is entirely normal .

		`` A Nation , '' it has been said , '' is an organized community within a certain territory . ''

		Later writers name this conception a
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		But every Nation may possess territory , as well as other property , external to the boundaries within which it is itself organized .

		This right is implied in the term '' external sovereignty . ''

		As the author of the work before us states the theory : '' The lands and populations which constitute the body and personality of the
State	ORGANIZATION	are not the only lands and populations over which it may exercise power .

		It is a fact that the
State	ORGANIZATION	may and does exer - cise power over lands and populations which are not , and can not in the nature of things be , a part of the body and personality of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and that it may be in a permanent relationship to these lands and popula - tions of such a kind that it must exercise power over them permanently . ''

		To the
United States	ORGANIZATION	pertain the same rights and privileges , in this respect , as are exercised by her fellow nations .

		What atti - tude she should maintain toward distant de - pendencies is a question that is new to her officials as a practical problem ; but the career upon which she has entered with the close of the nineteenth century has made this question imperative .


Patrick Henry	PERSON	's '' one lamp '' must again become our resource .

		Other na - tions have had experience in administering government in extraneous territories .

		To illustrate historically our present situation in this respect by examples drawn from the an - nals of our fellows , as well as by our own past usages , is the aim of an elaborate treatise by Mr.
Alpheus H. Snow	PERSON	, entitled `` The Admin - istration of Dependencies . ''

		This writer has made an exhaustive study of the precedents found in French and English history , and has ably marshalled those which are of present value to us .

		The administration of her de - pendencies by
France	LOCATION	from
1600	DATE	to
1787	DATE	, and the English administration prior to the charter of
Virginia	LOCATION	, are treated in separate chapters , following which the usages of
England	LOCATION	prior to her breach with her American colonies are copiously illustrated .

		The American Revolu - tion originated in a controversy over the ques - tion of the normal relations between the
King of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	and his American dependen - cies , and this controversy is set forth in extenso .

		The trend of colonial opinion at that time fol -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 48 lowed the lines marked out before
1750	DATE	by the political thought of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It was a transitional period , and the progress of change in the British constitution led to diverse views as to the nature of the British state and the constitution of her trans-Atlantic colonies .

		How the administration party and the colonial statesmen parted company after
1750	DATE	, at which time the characteristics of the American con - stitution seemed to be clearly understood on both sides , is succinctly stated by Mr.
Snow	PERSON	.

		The phases of the quarrel , and the demands and deliverances of both parties , from
1761	DATE	down to the final breach in
1776	DATE	, are fully de - tailed , as are also the successive steps taken by
America	LOCATION	thereafter , both in continuing her controversy with the mother-country , after ceasing to be a dependency herself , and in proceeding toward the administration on her own part of the territories that became her def -RRB- endencies .

		Herein we are furnished a brief history of the Revolutionary War from a new point of view , -- namely , that of a contention over the relations between a dominant state and its dependencies , leading up to the assump - tion by the late dependencies of nationality for themselves , including incidentally the ex - ercise of their own government over their de - pendencies .

		After showing how the American system of such government grew to align itself with the European precedents , the author illustrates the styles of such government , fol - lowed , since the consummation of the American Revolution , by the European states , including
Great Britain	LOCATION	, as well as the course pursued by our own country , in all of which examples there is seen to be a practical similarity in principle .

		The chapter on American admin - istration from
1787	DATE	to
1900	DATE	includes citations from some of the decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	on questions that have arisen under the Federal constitution , -- enough in number to illustrate the position taken by that tribunal , -- and sufficient to show abundant precedents , both legislative and judicial , in our own experience , to guide to the solution of all the problems which have recently confronted the nation . ''

		Colonial '' and '' Imperial '' are among the terms extensively used , in recent years , in re - ferring to the relations newly assumed by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The first of these adjectives is wrongly applied to the dependencies of our re - public ; and the second is largely used in that connection in a mistaken sense .

		This nation has no '' colonies '' in the proper meaning of that word , and never has had any .

		Colonies are one class of dependencies ; but all depend - encies are not colonies .

		Mr.
Snow	PERSON	is careful to adhere scrupulously to his chosen subject , and to write of '' dependencies '' in the proper sense , -- though one lapsus is perceptible in the sub-title which he chooses for his volume , '' A study of the evolution of the
Federal Empire	ORGANIZATION	, with spe - cial reference to American colonial problems . ''

		His frank adoption of the phrase '' Federal Empire '' shows that the bogey of '' imperial - ism '' does not affright this author .

		Disre - garding the old political sense of that term as indicating the despotic rule of an emperor , he freely uses it in its geographical sense .

		The extent of territory possessed by a nation which holds outlying lands in addition to its home domain is often well named an '' Empire . ''

		Geographically , the
United States	LOCATION	may be aptly styled an '' Imperial Domain , '' and this without any necessary implication of the other sense , in which the term describes a form of government .

		Modern developments in popular government have often given to a republic , whose political system is either representative or democratic , the possession of territories so extended and scattered that no terms so well describe the result as those which imply an em - pire in the geographical sense . ''

		The British Empire '' is a familiar example of such a do - main , from whose home government political imperialism is absent .

		Even a pure democracy may , as a dominant state , lord it over depend - encies as an imperial domain , without debasing its democracy .

		As the modern view is well summed up by Mr. Snow : * ■ The old conception of an Empire as a Kingdom composed of Kingdoms , and of an Emperor as a Kiog who rules over other
Kings	LOCATION	, is passing away , and in its stead has come the conception of the Empire as a
State	ORGANIZATION	composed of distinct and often widely separated popa - lations or States , of which a
State	ORGANIZATION	is the Central Gov - ernment or Emperor . ''

		Vattel , in his time , had come so far as to see much new meaning in the term '' empire , '' and to attribute to every nation , in addition to its own domain , the right of '' The empire , or right of supreme command over persons , by virtue of which it orders and disposes , according to its will , of the whole intercourse and commerce of the country . ''

		But it was only a few years later that
Burke	PERSON	, when discussing the relations be - tween
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her American Col - onies , said : '' My idea of it is this : That an Empire is the aggregate of many States , under one common Head , whether this Head be a monarch , or a presiding republic . ''

		The idea that the
United States	LOCATION	should in 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, time become the `` presiding republic '' of such an Empire is by no means a new thought of the nineteenth century .

		Such a state as
Great Britain	LOCATION	was recognized to be in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, the early American statesmen often assumed to be the destiny of
America	LOCATION	.

		It was in this geographical sense that
Madison	PERSON	, Ham - ilton ,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Ellsworth	LOCATION	,
Dickinson	PERSON	, Mar - shall , and others , -- men whose partisan views were far from concurrent , -- agreed in using the expressive phrase `` American Empire . ''

		The precedents cited by Mr.
Snow	PERSON	show how amply and continuously the actual practice of
America	LOCATION	in holding and governing her depen - dencies has justified this prophetic expression of the faith of the Fathers .

		The conclusion reached by Mr.
Snow	PERSON	, as a result of these novel historical investigations , is that '' the people of the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	, by their written constitution , consented to by all the people of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, have divided the governmental power under an unwritten Con - stitution , so that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is the
Imperial State	ORGANIZATION	as respects the dependencies . ''

		Thus has been established a '' Federal Empire , '' composed of '' the people and lands of the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	and the people and lands of its dependencies . ''

		The final chapter of the work is an exposition of the '' Imperial Obligations '' which are , by the establishment of this
Federal Empire	ORGANIZATION	, '' imposed upon the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	and its people . ''

		This imperial state '' has arisen out of the need for social and economic peace and for equalization of economic conditions , exactly as Confederations and Federal States arose ; it is the only form of organism by which the federative principle can be extended beyond the limits of lands occupied by a homogeneous population capable of self-government . ''

		The excerpts here given from this searching study into our colonial and national history will perhaps give some idea of its ambitious purpose .

		It is not merely a valuable contribution to the popular knowledge of our own institutions , -- it is an epoch-making book , as a profound ex - position of the inmost characteristics of the unwritten constitution of the Republic .

		The work exhibits defects which are largely in matters of detail , and which detract some - what from its high character , but which are apparently due to the author 's excess of enthu - siasm for his thesis .

		There is an unnecessary refinement of analysis , which furnishes no strength to his exposition or his argument , in the attempt to array the Revolutionary states - men against each other as Anti- Imperialists and Federal - Imperialists ; a distinction which the author does not suggest to have been under - stood by themselves , and which even he does not make clear .

		The same undue zeal has pressed too far some of his deductions respect - ing the positions occupied by the antagonistic parties prior to the Revolution .

		He regards it as established '' as a fundamental principle of the Constitution of the British Empire for the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, '' that '' the
King	PERSON	was the representative of
Great Britain	LOCATION	as the Im - perial
State	ORGANIZATION	, and that
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	was also its representative , superior to the King '' ; and he insists that '' nothing was better settled than that there were no constitutional conditions or limitations upon the power of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	when exercised within the realm of
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		But the colonial statesmen disputed both of these claims as to the supremacy of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and supported their contention by English pre - cedents , legislative and judicial ; and the argu - ments of
James Wilson	PERSON	and
John Adams	PERSON	came near to demonstrating that once there had ex - isted limitations upon the power of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, the benefit of which the colonists had not sur - rendered , and back to which they went in de - raigning their political rights .

		Omission of these superfluous statements would not have made any less effective or valuable the author 's general conclusions , which his numerous quo - tations from historical sources abundantly sustain .

Grammont	LOCATION	and Wood , and numerous other contemporary writers , more or less reputable , the author has collected material sufi & ciently suitable and trust - worthy for his purpose .

		In cases of a conflict of authorities , he has , with impartial pen , set down both sides and left the reader to take his choice .

		Possibly the meaning of both '' liter - ary '' and '' rake '' has been somewhat stretched to include all the gay company to which we are introduced ; but we will not quarrel with the author for that .

		The curious theory is put forward that , just as diet influences character , so the literature of any given period may perhaps take its tone from the beverage common in that period ; in other words , brandy , wine , and beer are thought to impart each its peculiar flavor to the prod - ucts of the pen .

		In reading the poetic effu - sions of the inebriate
Rochester	LOCATION	, one may well believe him to have stimulated his fancy with something stronger than ' * postum cereal . ''

		A century later Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	certainly found co - pious draughts of tea conducive to a ready flow of ideas .

		It is .

		then , not too much to admit that the coarseness of the poetry and plays pro- duced by
Rochester	LOCATION	and his companions was entirely in keeping with their sensual indul - gence in alcoholic stimulants , and indeed with their pleasures and diversions of every sort .

		Not even at the church door were fun and frolic left behind .

		The king himself , although he liked to hear the anthems , furnished a shining example of unexemplary behavior during the rest of the service .

		Not only was he unable to preserve his gravity , but he took pains to let it be seen that he felt not the slightest in - terest in religion .

		He would play at ' • peep '' with Lady Castlemaine through the curtains dividing the royal box from the ladies ' pew .

		When tired of this amusement , he would take a little nap , as is recorded in the scrap of verse not quoted by our author , but perhaps worth recalling here .

		It runs somewhat as follows : '' Old South , a witty churchman reckoned , Was preaching once to Charles the Second , When lo !

		the king began to nod , Deaf to the zealous man of God , Who , leaning o'er his pulpit cried To Lauderdale , by
Charles	PERSON	's side : • My Lord , why , 't is a shameful thing ; You snore so loud you 'll wake the king ! ' ''

		His easy familiarity with those about him is well known .

		Even when obliged to assert his dignity , he did so with grace and gentleness .


William Penn	PERSON	, being admitted on one occa - sion to the royal presence , kept his hat on in accordance with the rules of his sect , but con - trary to those of the court .

		Charles , how - ever , uncovered . ''

		Friend
Charles	PERSON	, '' quoth the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, '' why dost thou not keep on thy hat ? '' ''

		'T is the custom of this place , '' was the good - humored reply , '' for only one person to remain covered . ''

		Among '' the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease '' was the
Duke of Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	.

		His readiness of wit was once shown at an early performance of one of
Dryden	PERSON	's plays , an unlucky line of which ran thus , -- '' My wound is great because it is so small . ''

		Scarcely was this out of the player 's mouth when Buckingham sprang to his feet and responded , in a voice clearly audible to the house , -- '' Then ` twould be greater were it none at all . ''

		This killed the play , but its author took his revenge in '' Absalom and Achitophel . ''

		The favorite public amusements of the period were bear-baiting , bull-baiting , cock - fighting , and prize fights .

		Both
Pepys	PERSON	, who was not over-squeamish , and
Evelyn	PERSON	, who was more refined , have left accounts of such brutal sports .

		Even ladies were among the spectators .

		`` After dinner with my wife to the Bear
Gar	PERSON	- den , '' writes
Pepys	PERSON	, '' where ... I saw some good sport of bulls tossing of the dogs . ''

		And
Evelyn	PERSON	records : '' I went with some friends to the
Bear Garden	ORGANIZATION	, where was cock-fighting , dog-fighting , bear and bull-baiting , it being a famous day for all these butcherly sports , or rather barbarous cruelty .

		The bulls did ex - ceedingly well .

		One of the bulls tossed a dog full into a lady 's lap , as she sat in one of the boxes at a considerable height from the arena . ''

		To illustrate the table manners of high society ,
Pepys	PERSON	gives us an account of a banquet at the
Guildhall	LOCATION	, whither it was the fashion for courtiers to go and dine with the lord mayor .

		On one such occasion , when the din - ner was said to have cost between seven hun - dred and eight hundred pounds , we read that '' under every salt there was a bill of fare , '' but that only the mayors and the lords of the 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	'' privy council had napkins or knives .

		Before the meal all the guests repaired to the buttery and drank wine , in preparation for the solid refreshment to follow .

		The dinner began at one o'clock .

		Pepys sat at the merchants ' table .

		Ten courses were served , and there was also '' plenty of wine of all sorts . ''

		The plates were wooden , and were not changed throughout the dinner ; nor , as it appears , were the drinking cups , which were of earthen - ware .

		To justify his choice of a title , the author devotes a chapter to the consideration of his rakes ' literary productions .

		One couplet , from the ready rhymster ,
Rochester	LOCATION	, will here suffice : '' Our sphere of action is life 's happiness , And he that thinks beyond , thinks like an ass . ''

		Such was his creed ; so he lived , and so he all but died .

		Bishop Burnet , however , was sent for by the dissipated nobleman as he lay on his death bed , and the churchman seems to have enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing the rake make a good repentance and die an edi - fying death -- worn out by his excesses at the age of thirty-two .

		As to his virtues , the negative one of freedom from cant and hum - bug is ascribed to him , as well as to his asso - ciates in literary rakedom . ''

		It Is true that there is little good and much evil to be learned from their writings , but what evil there is in them is avowedly evil .

		These writers did not expound upon the deep religious feeling of their athe - ism , or the immaculate purity of their illicit affections ; nor did they call irregular alliances marriages in the sight of God though not in the sight of man .

		What - ever they may have been , they were not as a rule humbugs .

		With all its faults , their school was free from the atrocious affectation of the ' Euphuists ' of the reiiin of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, or , for that matter , from the almost as objectionable affectations of the many ` ists and ` isms of the reign of a much later and im - measurably better queen . ''

		One service , at least , these literary rakes are held to have rendered to the cause of let - ters : they helped to establish the tradition that none are so noble as to be unsusceptible of further ennoblement by worthy performance in literature .

		From their time to ours have been handed down , from one noble or even royal personage to another , the torch of learn - ing and the honorable distinction of authorship .

		* We have received from the '' Sign of the Hop-Pole , '' in Kent ,
England	LOCATION	, a Christmas greeting in the form of a leaflet containing
Christopher Plantin	PERSON	's sonnet '' Le Bonheur de ce Monde , '' beautifully printed on Japanese vellum by the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	in the French typography of
Plantin	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		Dr.
C. C. Everett	PERSON	,
Bussey	PERSON	Professor of Theology in the divinity school of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, died in
October , 1900	DATE	.

		For thirty years he had delivered annually a course of lectures , at first entitled '' The Science of Re - ligion , '' but finally '' The Psychological Ele - ments of Religious Faith . ''

		During all this period their general substance remained the same , but they were changed in detail and em - bellished with new thoughts and illustrations each year .

		When his death brought the lec - tures to a close , there was a strong desire on the part of those who had heard them that they should be preserved in book form .

		It was found , however , that Dr.
Everett	PERSON	had left no manuscript , and apparently had never written the lectures out .

		Under these circum - stances , recourse was had to the notes of a number of those who had attended the course , and from these Professor
Edward Hale	PERSON	wrote out the lectures and prepared them for the press .

		One would not , as a rule , expect very much of a work prepared in the manner just ex - plained ; but Professor
Hale	PERSON	has managed ta overcome the difficulties of the situation ta such an extent that I believe no reader would ever suspect what had been done if he were not informed .

		The work , as it stands , is a little masterpiece in its way , clear and forcible , singularly free from hysteria or dogmatism , and almost wholly without those technical terms which make many psychological writing * unintelligible to the man in the street .

		In the course of the book we are given three defini - tions of religion .

		The first is : Religion i '' ' feeling , or essentially feeling .

		The primacy of feeling is insisted upon , as on p. 22 : `` All that the intellect can do , however , is not too much to meet the highest feelings .

		Feeling has the primacy .

		Intellect is for the sake of feeling .

		What we do is done to gratify feel - ing .

		In science and philosophy feeling is the beginning , the middle , and the end . ''

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 feeling , however , is not religions , and so we need the second definition -LRB- p. 88 -RRB- : Religion is the feeling tovcard the supernatural .

		This is intended to include all religions : bat it is unsatisfactory inasmuch as the supernatural may include positive or negative , good or bad , elements .

		The devil represents the negative supernatural , • ' The spirit that always denies . ''

		Hence we may reach a third definition , which is typical rather than inclusive : Religion is a feeling tovcard a Supernatural Presence tnani - festing itself in truth , goodness , and beauty .

		In this definition we may substitute '' spirit - ual ■ ' for ' ■ supernatural , '' as a footnote informs us was done by Dr.
Everett	PERSON	in his longer course of lectures .

		At the end of the last lecture we read : '' The ideal religion , the one perfect religion , woald be that in which the presence of the
Absolate Spirit	ORGANIZATION	shoald be fnllr recognized , and the ideas of the rea - son -- truth , goodness , and beaatj -- acknowledged as the content of this
Absolnte Spirit	ORGANIZATION	.

		The various re - ligions of the work suggest and approach the ideal religion each to a greater or less degree .

		The ideal religion is like the pure air of the upper heaven as compared with the atmosphere of the earth .

		The lower atmosphere is everywhere different ; it is vitiated bj mists and dust and smoke and all the various earthly elements ; yet we breathe it , and find in it , with all its impurity , life and strength and refreshment . ''

		Dr.
Everett	PERSON	held that the apparent decline in religious interest might be due in large measure to the fact that the higher types of religion did not appeal to so many as the older , lower , forms . ''

		There is more true religion in half an hour 's questioning , ' What wilt thou have me to do ? '

		than in a whole lifetime of asking , ` What wilt thou do for me ? ' ''

		-LRB- p. 129 . -RRB-

		Yet the latter thought is the one most prominent in the minds of many religions peo - ple of the baser sort , and the hope of personal reward and the fear of punishment are always prominent in low types of religion , whether they are labeled Christianity or otherwise .

		It is true , of course , that the highest religions have their basis in personal satisfaction or happiness : but this is spiritual , and oomes through a sense of unity with the all-pervasive spirit . ''

		Theology and the Social Consciousness , '' by
President King of Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	, is based on a course of lectures delivered at the
Harvard Summer School of Theology	ORGANIZATION	in
1901	DATE	.

		It recognizes the '' social consciousness '' as a sig - nificant phenomenon in the ethical life of our time , and seeks to determine its relation to theological doctrines .

		The book is divided into three sections , headed respectively -LRB- 1 -RRB- '' The Real Meaning of the Social Conscious - ness for Theology , '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- '' The Influence of the Social Consciousness upon the Conception of Religion , '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' The Influence of the So - cial Consciousness upon Theological Doctrine . ''

		The author insists equally njwn the essential like-mindedness of men and the sacredness of the person .

		We are to be compared , perhaps , to innumerable radii of a circle having their common source at one point , but each occupy - ing its own place and no other .

		The spiritual point of union of all human souls is what we call God .

		Hence the essential blessings of religion are capable of being shared by all , and emphasis is placed on that which is com - mon to the whole of mankind .

		The genius , who in one sense seems so apart , is he who recognizes great truths and laws , -- that is , common and pervading , not exceptional things or remote .

		Jesus was a great religious genius -LRB- whatever else he may have been -RRB- and hence it is found that his doctrines are of universal application .

		It is often held that the early Christians , being nearest in point of time to
Christ	LOCATION	, were necessarily best informed and best able to understand his teachings .

		President
King	PERSON	recognizes that in those days the teachings were new , or at least sufficiently so to fit with difficulty into the '' mental platforms '' of con - temporaries .

		It is a matter of history that many excellent and talented people were wholly unable to receive them .

		Since then , however , we have undergone a considerable intellectual evolution , and it is reasonable to suppose that the Christians of to-day are better fitted to receive the word -LRB- supposing it to be a true or universal word -RRB- than any before .

		At first sight , this conception seems in direct conflict with that of Dr.
Everett	PERSON	mentioned above , that the later forms of religion may have less universal acceptance .

		Yet we have just seen that when Christianity was new it was received by few , and a superficial observer might have urged that it was obviously not fit for the mass of humanity .

		If religious thought has made no progress since that day , if Christ really spoke the final word , it may then be fairly urged that we are coming nearer and nearer to a common and universal religion .

		But if , as Dr.
Everett	PERSON	assumed , religion is progressing just as science or art , the best must always be for the few , though what is to-day known to a minority will in time become common property .

		This is a condition of progress , spiritual , men - tal , or physical ; and we are reluctant to rec - 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, ognize any exceptions to it .

		If Christianity seems an exception , it is only because it is still a long way ahead of most of us ; and that it should in reality be adopted by all is the best perhaps we are able to conceive .

		So much for President
King	PERSON	's work .

		The above is not a very precise summary of his positions , and we had intended a little adverse criticism ; but it may be as useful to record the impressions the book gave as to attempt an exact summary of its contents .

		Dr.
Cone	PERSON	, in his '' Rich and Poor in the New Testament , '' examines the Scriptural say - ings relating to social subjects , and concludes that we find '' neither a social philosophy , nor the foundations , nor the outlines of a social system . ''

		Yet he ends with these words : '' We must leave it to the students of social science to point out in detail the means of solving the intricate problems that wealth and poverty force upon their attention .

		Our task has been accomplished if we have succeeded in showing how in a general way the ethical ideals presented in the New Testament may furnish guidance and inspiration in this great task .

		If we have not found any definite form of a system of society indicated in its pages , we have found , it is hoped , the basis of every true aud permanent social order because the foundation of all true living for the individual man .

		Let not men reject the spirit of its great teachings be - cause they stumble at the letter .

		Rather let them apply this spirit to the social problems of every age , and thus hasten the advent of the kingdom of brother - hood and peace . ''

		In interpreting the doctrines of Jesus , we think Dr.
Cone	PERSON	has not sufficiently recognized the probable modifications due to their being reported by others , who , as we have just said , could not in the nature of things receive them without bias .

		It seems to the present writer that we may read between the lines , as it were , a more logical and spiritual philosophy than the written word sets forth .

		Jesus was surely the Great Emancipator , who preached the spiritual freedom of man , who saw that it was possible in a spiritual sense to rise above physical failure and misery .

		He did this in his own life , and his gospel was especially to the poor , for they most seemed to need it .

		The spiritual dignity of the human soul , its independence because of its dependence upon the great source of spiritual power , -- here was an idea which made mere physical wealth or power seem trivial and insignificant .

		If the disciples looked for a physical millennium , it was only because they could not understand . ''

		The Law of Growth , '' by the late
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, and '' The Small End of Great Prob - lems , '' by Rev.
Brooke Herford	PERSON	, are two books of sermons of which we can give no adequate summary in a small space .

		That they were good sermons , the names of the preachers are sufficient to assure us ; but they doubtless were better to bear than they are to read .

		The cheerful positivism which sounds well enough in the pulpit is sometimes a little trying in cold print .

		Briefs on New Books .

		An encyclopaedia is a serious under - Me ^ hnai . ''

		* ak ' `` g ' involving great expense , years of preparation , and the col - laboration of great numbers of authoritative writers .

		A new encyclopaedia is more apt to be an old one patched up than a strictly new production , and this , of course , is a strictly justifiable proceeding when the old name is preserved , and no attempt is made to deceive the public .

		The need of an entirely new English encyclopaedia has been keenly felt of late years , and the need has at last been met by the `` New International '' of Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is true that even in this case , some use has been made of the old '' International '' text , but only where that text remains valid in the light of the most recent knowledge .

		To all intents and purposes , the work of which three volumes are now at hand is a new compilation of universal knowledge , and has been edited with skill and conscience by President
Gilman	PERSON	, Professor
Peck	PERSON	, and Mr.
Colby	PERSON	, aided by a large staff of competent specialist writers .

		It is an encyclopaedia of the
Brockhaus	PERSON	or Chambers type -- that is , a work made up of many brief articles rather than of a smaller num - ber of extensive treatises .

		The letter A , for ex - ample , aside from the geographical articles -LRB-
Africa	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, Austro-Hungary , and
America	LOCATION	-RRB- yields only two articles -LRB- Archaeology and Armies -RRB- that are more than ten pages in length .

		In fact , the article that exceeds a single page is rare in pro- portion to the number that consist of single brief paragraphs .

		The work is thus made exceptionally useful for ready reference , which should be , after all , the chief purpose of an encyclopaedia .

		Although a list of special writers is printed in the forefront of the work , it is distinctly explained that these contributions have been revised and amended by the oflBce staff , so that no article of any length is to be considered the work of a single writer .

		In the subdivision of matter , we find even such minor entries as are usually sought out in Readers ' Handbooks and other reference works of like char - acter .

		Geography , biography , and science , are subjects that have been given an unusual degree of attention , and in the matter of lucidity and general attractiveness of style the work has been well done .

		The illustrations are numerous , and the full-page plates are unusually attractive , although the raison

		d'Ure of their selection is not always obvious .

		We are glad , for example , to have the colored plate which gives ns six familiar varieties of the apple , bat we could imagine many other subjects equally deserving of such elaborate illustration .

		The maps are numerous , and like moat maps in American books are made inartistic by crude coloring and ugly lettering .

		The physical maps are much better done .

		The third volume of the work ends with
Canada	LOCATION	, and there are to be seventeen in all , including something like sixty thousand articles .

		The simple record of an honorable life , whose main incidents are replete with inspiration for American youth , is presented in Dr.
William Lawrence	PERSON	's biographi - cal sketch of the late Governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, the Honorable
Roger Wolcott	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The biographer is the Bishop of the Episcopalian Church in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, who honors himself in overlooking denominational boundaries , in his zeal to furnish an early biography of his great fellow citizen .

		With a facile pen , and in easy flowing style , he recounts the principal events in the career of the
Harvard	LOCATION	scholar , orator , patriot , public servant , and man of affairs , whom the
Bay State	ORGANIZATION	was delighted to honor in many capacities .

		It is but a brief sketch of a life which has been all too brief ; but its agreeable diction , and the nobility of the subject of the sketch , charm the reader at every page .

		The eminent public services of Gov - ernor
Wolcott	PERSON	are narrated without prolixity , but with due appreciation of their value to his country - men .

		Numerous extracts from his addresses and speeches make the book a portfolio of eloquence ; among these is his acknowledgment , in behalf of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, as her Governor , of the receipt from
England of Bradford	ORGANIZATION	's original manuscript of the `` History of Plimoth Plantation . ''

		In this little masterpiece of American oratory , the speaker thus exalts the Pilgrim Fathers : '' In the varied tapestry which pictures our national life , the richest spots are those where gleam the golden threads of conscience , courage , and faith , set in the web by that little band . ''

		This gem of speech is worthy to rank with Lincoln 's '' The mystic chords of mem - ory . ''

		It is a fair example of the general character of Mr.
Wolcott	PERSON	's public deliverances .

		An ■ up-to-date ^ ^ ' * ° ® '' ^ ° ** much to say that the ireatueon need of a work which should satis - Copyrighi law .

		f actorily gather into a single volume the large and confused mass of legal enactment and decision on the question of Copyright has never been so satisfactorily filled as by the book prepared by Mr.
E. J. MacGillivray	PERSON	, LL.B. , and bearing the fully descriptive title , '' A Treatise upon the
Law of Copyright	ORGANIZATION	in
theUnited Kingdom	LOCATION	and the Dominions of the Crown , and in the
United States of America	LOCATION	, Containing a Full Appendix of All Acts of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment ,

Council	ORGANIZATION	,
Treasury Minutes	ORGANIZATION	, and Acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	now in Force '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Unlike nearly all of its pre - decessors in this field of continually growing im - portance , the book is concerned with questions of Copyright alone , and does not confuse this topic with any reference to patent and trade-mark cases .

		On the historical side of the question , it hardly does more than refer the reader to the standard works of Messrs.
Copinger	PERSON	,
Scrutton	PERSON	, and Drone , with an especial commendation of Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	's `` The Law and History of Copyright in Books , '' one of the few law treatises that have positive and in - trinsic literary merit .

		Mr.
MacGillivray	PERSON	occupies himself with accounting for things as they are rather than as they were , or -LRB- a frequent chapter in such volumes -RRB- on things as they ought to be .

		He has not much to say about the common-law on the subject , -- wisely enough , since the abrogation of the common-law principle of ownership in publica - tions and works of art by statutory tinkering has left the author and artist with little but regret But he does give all needful information for the perfect understanding of the English and American law as it exists to-day , so far as that is comprehen - sible .

		The long-delayed promise of a consolidated act on Copyright in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is another oc - casion for apology , since the law there is left in a condition where precedent rather than precise statement governs , -- the book throughout being therefore an excellent example of case law .

		The condition of Copyright in the
United States	LOCATION	occu - pies the latter half of the book , containing sixty - eight pages as against more than two hundred on the subject in general and as particularized in the British dominions .

		In both parts the work is brought almost into the living present , the one no - ticeable omission on the American side being the question of copyright in news , an important topic in this country , especially since a recent decision has given such rights to a monopoly with the ut - most power for harm , whether so used or not .

		In spite of the fact that this is a formal book of law , Mr.
MacGillivray	PERSON	is at times entertaining , and his work is admirably digested , fully organized , pro- vided with all needful indexes and appendices , and certain to fill an important place hitherto vacant .

		It is always a grateful thing to see that justice is done to some person or cause maliciously aspersed in this curiously dealing world .

		The name of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	has always been one that has worked marvels ; the fame of the world 's chief poetess has been freely accorded her ; her successors in her art have made translations or paraphrases of her poems , and then have unhesitatingly acknowledged that they have undertaken a task that was impossible ; writers , statesmen , readers of all classes , have repeated her praises , admitted her claims , placed her in an unassailable pre-eminence .

		We may quote from Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	: '' The world has suffered no greater literary loss than the loss of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's poems .

		So perfect are the smallest fragments preserved that `` LotlLetleri from Lesboi . ''

		60 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, we muse in astonishment to think what the com - plete poems must have been .

		Of all the poets of the world ,
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	is the one whose every word has a peculiar and unmistakable perfume , a seal of absolute perfection and inimitable grace .

		In her art she was unerring . ''

		But , on the other hand , the character of Sappho has been subjected to a very different treatment .

		She has come down the ages enveloped in a cloud of story and allusion which allows but vague and difficult appreciation of what she really was .

		The Comic Dramatists have played havoc with her life and activity , their comments and veracious interpretations have passed current , and it needed the labors of
Welcker	PERSON	and
Blass	PERSON	and
Wharton	LOCATION	to bring about a rehabilitation of the poetess .

		In her '' Lost Letters from Lesbos '' -LRB-
Donnelley	PERSON	-RRB- , Mrs.
Lucy McDowell Milburn	PERSON	has carried on the alluring labor .

		The '' Lost Letters '' were found by one of those miracles which come only into the experiences of novelists and poets , and they are the letters which
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	wrote to that Egyptian lover who is supposed to have been one of the Egyptian Kings .

		The old Greek life , with its freshness , its charm , its poetry , reappears in these letters .

		Both the prose and the verse recall the Lander clearness and magic .

		The per - sonality of Sappho as revealed in these intimate outpourings diflfers by the whole diameter of being from the
Sappho of the Comic Dramatists	ORGANIZATION	.

		She is what the greatest poetess of all time surely ought to have been .

		Mrs.
Milburn	PERSON	has put into these letters her high idealism of thought and belief , and has made a picture which the lover of
Greece	LOCATION	will gladly admit into his memory .

		Its imaginative insight will help to make plain many things which history leaves obscure , and the book ought to find appreciative readers everywhere .

		A new series of biographical art -
Brii	PERSON	^ h ^ Ari . '' '

		^ Studies is begun with four volumes -LRB- imported by Messrs.
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons -RRB- under the general title '' The Makers of British Art . ''

		Mr.
James A. Manson	PERSON	, the editor of the series , writes of
Landseer	PERSON	, pointing out in his preface the surprising meagreness of material for an adequate and sympathetic biography , and the consequent necessity of making his art-work tell the whole story of his life .

		The volume on
Turner	ORGANIZATION	is written by Mr.
Robert Chignell	PERSON	, who aims to do better justice to the man , in distinction from the painter , than have previous biographers .

		No special originality is claimed for the life of
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	, by
Elsa D'Esterre Keeling	PERSON	, except its attempt to steer a middle course between the extremes of unreasoning laudation and careless dispraise , -- two attitudes so often adopted toward this painter .

		In the volume on Romney , Sir Her - bert
Maxwell	PERSON	attempts to collate the three previous biographies of
Cumberland	LOCATION	,
Hayley	PERSON	, and
John Rumney	PERSON	, and thus to arrive at a proper under - standing of the artist and his work ; a feature of the book is the excellent catalogue of
Romney	ORGANIZATION	's works , -- probably the fullest that has yet been compiled .

		Each biography is supplied with ap - pendices , a bibliography , and a complete index for the student 's use .

		Each has a photogravure por - trait , and about twenty plates .

		These are printed on good paper , and are distinct and thoroughly satisfactory , especially in the case of
Landseer	PERSON	's work , which lends itself particularly well to this sort of reproduction .

		Some sensible things sensibly stated Six , enMie ^ ^ ^ f ^ ^ ^ ^ j ^ j -RRB- , j ^ jj ^ ^ j j Savage 's '' Men and Women -LRB-
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The six chapters of the book are on '' Man and Woman , '' `` Love and Mar - riage , '' '' Parent and Child , '' '' Home and Society , '' '' The Ethics of Divorce , '' and '' The Growing Independence of Women . ''

		They speak to the reader in a simple , conversational tone , and ap - pear to have been put forth originally as pulpit discourses .

		While it is impossible that all readers should agree with everything these little homilies contain , the book is at least thought-provoking , and its utterances have the prime essential of thorough sincerity and reasoned conviction .

		One or two seed thoughts may be given here .

		The author be - lieves there is danger of too much organization for reform , for civic study , for literary and artistic cul - ture .

		A person joins a society , or club , or lecture class , and that is too often the end of it ; a passive , recipient attitude takes the place of energetic indi - vidual action .

		And the same is true in religioas matters .

		The divorce question is ably discussed , and attention is called to the curious fact that al - though the
United States	LOCATION	has the most liberal of divorce laws , its morals are of the highest , and no - where else does woman hold a position of such re - spect and dignity .

		Indeed , a certain freedom of divorce is necessary for the safeguarding of her in - terests and her independence .

		The immense harm wrought by the reckless application of scripture texts to modern conditions receives a fitting word . ''

		He that spareth bis rod hateth his son , '' still gives sanction to a mode of discipline regarded by the author as worse than brutal .

		He says , '' I do not believe that any father or mother on the face of this earth has the right to strike a child .

		I would call it brutal if it were not a libel on the brutes .

		It seems to me utterly inexcusable , always and every - where . ''

		A history of ' ^ ' ^ ^ literature of gardens , recently Engiuh pleasure grown SO prolific along descriptive gardens .

		^ ^ ^ sentimental lines , has received a unique and valuable addition in the handsome vol - ume on ' * English Pleasure Gardens '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an historical treatment of one phase of the subject by
Miss Rose Standish Nichols	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Britanno	PERSON	- Roman gardens , with which horticulture in En - gland began , though known to have existed , must be conjecturally reconstructed from relics or from Greek and Roman models .

		The early monastic gardens , likewise , must be described chiefly in terms
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 of '' what we may well believe . ''

		But there are facts aboat the mediwval pleasaunce , and even one or two gurvivals of it still to be found in
England	LOCATION	.

		With the Tudor period , gardens take on more of their modem aspect , and since then their development has been steady , if along diverse lines .

		The final chapter of Miss
Nichols	PERSON	's book deals with the gar - dens of to day , under the broad division into natur - alistic and formal , and discusses briefly the relative merits of the two styles .

		Miss
Nichols	PERSON	has fur - nished over three hundred photographs and draw - ings for her book , and there are eleven plans by Mr.
Allen N. Cox	PERSON	.

		The whole history goes to show that English horticulture is a craft , not an art , and that it still lacks fundamental and admitted prin - ciples .

		But apart from this thesis , and from the suggestive value which the book will have for the professional horticulturalist -LRB- who will especially priie the bibliography -RRB- , it is popularly written and will be of real interest to the general reader .

		A fair and succinct summary of the f -LRB- f emr nmiimtit gubstance of the recent shower of `` ^ F * '' *** '' - `` centennial '' publications on the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and kindred essays illustrative of the geographical expansion of our country , ap - pears in a small and compact volume entitled ' `` The Territorial Growth of the United Sutes , '' written by Mr.
William A. Mowry	PERSON	and published by Messrs. Silver .


Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From an evidently careful study of this phase of our national life , the author has compiled chapters in which , in con - densed form , the salient facts are stated concerning our several arquieitions of territory , by the treaty with
Great Britain	LOCATION	in
1783	DATE	; the
Louisiana	LOCATION	,
Florida	LOCATION	, and
Texas	LOCATION	cessions ; and also those in the cases of
Alaska	LOCATION	,
Hawaii	LOCATION	,
Porto Rico	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Philippine Archipelago	LOCATION	.

		Oregon is the only territory of large importance to which we have acquired a right by discovery and occuf -RRB- ation ; and the subject of these and our other claims to
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	is well summed up , being properly accorded great `` r space than any of our other landed acquisitions .

		A series of thirteen colored maps illustrates pictorially the situation at each of the successive steps of our national expan - sion , and makes clear the relative value and extent of each accession of territory .

		Thus we are fur - nished a hand-book , suitable for ready reference , which will be a great convenience to the many who , while interested in these historical and geo - graphical subjects , have not shelf room in their libraries for the more extensive treatises that the enterprise of poblisbers has lately multiplied .

		Around the life-story of the
Gracchi	LOCATION	,
Sulla	LOCATION	, Crassus .

		Cato ,
Pompey	LOCATION	.

		and CaB $ ar .

		Professor
Oman	LOCATION	, in his book on `` Seven Roman Statesmen '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , has certainly woven a very readable sketch of the period of Roman history to which these names belong .

		In his opinion , the reaction against the biographical element in history-writing has gone too far , and it is tame to look at Roman history again with
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	before us no less than
Mommsen	PERSON	and
Marquardt	PERSON	.

		In general , the view expNMed is that the Roman republic went down because of its inability to bear up the burdens entailed by its own expansion ; and its occasional reformers , whether democratic or aris - tocratic , failed of success from their ignorance of the deeper features of the problems before them .

		Without under-rating the insight and ability of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, Professor
Oman	LOCATION	strikes telling blows at the idealized Cse '' ar of the German school , as so many other recent writers have done .

		The empire of which CsBsar laid the foundations was a period of mere soulless material prosperity , -- a magnificent failure , whether considered as a despotism or a bureaucracy , lapsing gradually into moral and phys - ical impotence , and destined to sink into the Chinese type of stagnation but for the assaults from without and the new ideals of Christianity within .

		The trained historical student will perhaps prefer some - thing of a different type , but the average intelligent reader will find this volume both stimulating and profitable . ''

		How to Attract the Birds , and ^ ^ T ^ J ^ J ^ JUJ ^ Ij ^ Other Talks about Bird Neighbors '' * ^ is the title of a new book by '' Neltje Blancban '' -LRB- Mrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	-RRB- , similar in its charm - ingly intimate and suggestive style to her other books about birds , but shorter and more desultory , each chapter being complete in itself and connected loosely , if at all , with the other chapters of the work .

		The first essay , '' How to Invite Bird Neighbors , '' is perhaps the freshest and most inter - esting .

		It is full of novel suggestions to the land - owner who wants to persuade the birds to nest in his garden or orchard and under his eaves .

		The second chapter is devoted to some special means of keeping the ruby-throat with us through the
summer	DATE	.

		The others deal , in fresh and original fashion , with various habits of the birds ; and there is a chapter on ' • What Birds Do for Us '' calcu - lated to convince even the owners of cherry-trees .

		The book is beautifully illustrated with a great number of remarkable photographs that catch the birds in all sorts of interesting and unexpect `` d situations , and in themselves make us feel better acquainted with oar bird neighbors .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The book which Mr.
Percival Chubb	PERSON	has written on '' The Teaching of English in the Elementarr and the Secondary School '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- is so sound in its phi - losophy and so practical in its belpfnlness that we wish it might come into the hands of every instructor in the country who is engaged with this vastly important subject .

		It is based upon the fundamental principle of `` unity and continuity in the Eoglish course from its begioDing in the kindergarten up through the high school . ''

		We doubt if so good and useful a book upon the subject has before been written , and the author 's 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, treatment is charming in style besides being based upon the most intelligent principles of pedagogy .

		If the spirit of this book could once find a permanent lodgment in our schools , it would work a revolution in methods , and secure for English its proper place in the educational scheme .

		It is not often that the play-goer can take with him to the theatre , or read beforehand , such admirable translations of foreign dramas as are provided by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	for
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's '' Es Lebe das Leben '' -LRB- `` The Joy of Living , '' Scribner -RRB- , and by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	for
Signor d'Annunzio	PERSON	's '' Francesca da
Rimini	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The latter reproduction is , in truth , not so much a translation as a noble English poem , and should prove a cause of much gratitude in admirers of
Signora Duse	PERSON	who can not read Italian .

		The late Bishop of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	did no more important work in his chosen historical field than that which he contributed to the Rolls Series , in the form of pref - aces to the volumes which he edited .

		Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	has done us a distinct service by editing , in a single volume , these '' Historical Introductions to the Rolls Series , '' thus placing this valuable material within the reach of every student .

		The volume is published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Charles Sumner	PERSON	's '' Addresses on War , '' with an introduction by Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	, is a volume pub - lished by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for
the International Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		This publication is in the interest of the peace movement to which Mr.
Ginn	PERSON	is now devoting much of his energy and his means , and is offered at the cost of production .

		It includes the three great addresses : `` The True Grandeur of Nations , '' `` The War System of the
Commonwealth of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` The Duel between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Two reprints of old English plays have recently come to hand , one edited by Mr.
F. I. Carpenter	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, the other by Mr.
Arthur H. Quiun	PERSON	, of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Chi - cago book inaugurates the octavo series of the uni - versity 's Decennial Publications , and gives us , with much learned apparatus , the text of
Lewis Wager	PERSON	's '' The Life and Repentaunce of
Marie Magdalene	PERSON	, '' a morality play dating from about the middle of the six - teenth century .

		The
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	book is a reprint of the anonymous comedy , '' The Faire Maide of
Bristow	PERSON	, '' published in
1605	DATE	, and variously attributed to Day ,
Wilkins	PERSON	,
Armin	PERSON	, and
Barnes	PERSON	, although upon no good evidence in any one of the four cases .

		The present editor gives it up .

		This play was translated into Ger - man by
Tieck	PERSON	nearly a century ago .

		Both of these plays are now reprinted for the first time .

		A book called `` The American Idea '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is a compilation by Mr.
Joseph P. Gilder	PERSON	, of the typical American documents -- Declaration , Articles , Constitu - tion , speeches by
Washington	LOCATION	,
Webster	PERSON	, and
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		Speeches by the last three of our Presidents are included -- a very dubious choice -- and both Senator
Hoar	PERSON	and Secretary Hay are represented .

		The extract from
Lowell	LOCATION	's '' De - mocracy '' belongs here with better right than several of the other selections .

		The idea of this book is not exactly a new one , but similar collections heretofore have been planned for school purposes rather than for the use of the general reader .

		The editor contributes a sophomoric introduction that might better have been omitted .

		A man who will talk about '' Old Glory '' deserves no quarter .

		* ' Is it possible to get at a working hypothesis as to the cause of laughter , -- to be able to explain , that is , in terms however vague and general , the nature of the mainspring which excites a manifes - tation of human emotion , sometimes pleasant , sometimes con - temptuous , sometimes triumphant , sometimes fiendish ?

		No more thorough answer -- though perhaps no complete answer will ever be given -- to that question has yet been published than that of Professor
Jamea Sully	PERSON	... not the first writer , of course , to propound a ` theory of laughter , ' but he is perhaps the first , so far as we are concerned , to give us something near a satisfying proposi - tion . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 92 NOTES 93 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 95 LIST OF N-EW BOOKS 95 LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS .

		It was twenty years ago that the first at - tempts were made in this country to bring about a more intimate relation than had before existed between the work of the public library and the public school .

		Dr.
Poole	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	and Dr. Green of
Worcester	LOCATION	were the pioneer experimenters in this field , and they made a special effort to attract to the library classes of students from the higher grades of the schools , providing for them special collections of books , temporarily set apart for their inspec - tion , and entertaining them with informal talks about the proper use of libraries .

		From this modest beginning has sprung , as all who have followed the history of the library move - ment are aware , a development of complicated and helpful activities on the part of librarians , having for their general purpose the correla - tion of school and library work , and now occupying an important place in the modern conception of the librarian 's function .

		The public library of to-day has a children 's de - partment as a matter of course , and makes it a pleasant place for children to resort to , pro- viding for them both books and pictures , with the accompaniment of sympathetic and kindly counsel .

		The same library is alert to follow the school course of study , to set apart the books most useful in its pursuit , to prepare special bulletins and annotated lists for teach - ers and pupils , to offer opportunities for the assembling of classes , to encourage groups of teachers bent upon professional culture , and to facilitate in many other ways the extension of library privileges to those who are engaged in the work of the schools .

		During the earlier phase of this development the essential purpose seems to have been the attraction of teachers and students to the library .

		During recent years the work has taken on a new phase , having for its controll - ing idea the bringing of the library to the school .

		This is a logical outcome of what has been learned in most large cities from the establishment of branch libraries and the de - velopment of a special delivery service .

		The most successful public library system is the one which is not content with the mere opening 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, of its doors and the welcoming of those who enter , but undertakes the more active work of bringing its books into every neighborhood , and almost into every home .

		The special lesson of this experience for educational work is being taken to heart in many progressive communities , where the library is now being brought into the school instead of standing apart and waiting for the school to seek it out .

		The way of accomplishing this purpose is to grant exceptional privileges to students and school officers , to permit books to be taken in larger numbers and kept for longer periods than are allowed the general public .

		Under this system , for example , a teacher of some subject may be permitted to draw a collection of fifty books at a time , and keep them for a whole term , thus incalculably enriching the work done by his class , and giving to every student of the subject an opportunity to sup - plement his own single text-book with a suc - cession of others .

		A second plan , which is particularly commendable for large cities hav - ing many large schools , is that of setting apart one room in each school as a special delivery station , or even as a branch library , with its own well-selected supply of reference books and its own special attendant .

		We anticipate important results from the development of this idea , which would doubtless be put widely into practice if it were not for the expense involved and the question of service .

		This difficulty appears to be twofold : there is the question of expense , absolutely con - sidered , and there is the question as to who should bear it .

		In our large cities , the library board and the school board are usually distinct bodies of coordinate powers .

		There is thus a tendency for each of them to desire to shift upon the shoulders of the other the burden of any work done for their helpful correlation .

		The school trustees will object to providing space and heat and light for library purposes , and the library trustees will as naturally object to paying the wages of an attendant who would be to all intents and purposes a member of the school staff .

		This is a real difficulty , but it should not prove insuperable .

		As far as the question of absolute expense goes , the only thing to say is that it must be met by the public in some way if the thing is really worth doing educationally .

		As President Eliot re - minds us now and then , the public is only just beginning to realize its responsibilities in the matter of education , and our present expendi - ture , although it seems liberal in comparison with the expenditure of a generation ago , will in the not far distant future be seen to have been niggardly in comparison with what will then be regarded as both legitimate and necessary .

		It is of course true that the sort of educa - tional stimulus that we are now considering -- the stimulus that comes from the large use of books by both teachers and students -- may be gained by having the books permanently in the schools , and belonging to them , instead of tem - porarily , and belonging to the general public col - lection .

		While the time is never likely to come when the public library will not be a useful adjunct to the work of the schools , the time is already at hand when the school will be in large measure independent of outside sources of supply .

		The school library -- not viewed as a miscellaneous collection of books for reading , but as a carefully selected outfit of tools for teaching purposes - -- already exists in many places , and will soon be found in many more .

		This library does not seek to include as many titles as possible ; it seeks rather to include an adequate supply of the books that are most needed , the number of which need not be very great .

		It is a library in which all the mem - bers of a class may be using the same work at the same time , because a sufficient number of copies are at hand .

		It is a library plentifully supplied with such reprints as the '' Old South Leaflets '' and such inexpensive reproductions of standard literature as may be found in more than one popular paper-covered series .

		It is a library which has for its counterpart in the same school the scientific laboratory , with its multiplication of microscopes , and balances , and galvanometers .

		This last suggestion is the one that most needs to be used , because it provides the clear - est argument for what is going to be the next great step in school equipment .

		It is all very well to talk about the teacher as being the sum total of the school , but the most zealous and inspired of teachers can not do the work of modern education without the aid of a great many material accessories .

		In the matter of this material equipment , our schools do very well upon what may be called the showy side ; they are apt to have elaborate buildings , and amply - equipped gymnasiums , assembly-halls , and playgrounds .

		But the internal equipment often lags far behind , although it is the most important of all .

		The department of science has , indeed , for the most part made its fight and won its victory .

		A generation ago , it cost
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 76 something of a struggle to get a few hundred dollars expended for scientific apparatus and material , even for a school that might have cost a hundred thousand dollars or more .

		Now our good high schools have their scientific labora - tories as a matter of course , and the appropria - tion for their maintenance has become a matter of unquestioned routine .

		But today it costs the same effort to get a few hundred dollars ' worth of books that it formerly cost to get a meagre supply of apparatus and chemicals .

		The depart - ments of history and literature still have to beg for their laboratories as the scientific depart - ments had to beg for theirs thirty years ago .

		It is not yet recognized that the library of a school is the laboratory for all those studies which we call the humanities , and is entitled to the same liberal provision .

		It should be made a matter of principle that in every school of the higher grade as much money should be spent annually upon library material as upon material for the scientific laboratories , and until this principle is universally recognized and acted upon , the teaching of the most im - portant group of subjects in any school will be at a disadvantage .

		In the development of school equipment this is the next important step to be taken , and there is no good reason to doubt that the coming generation will find the parity practically accomplished .

		As long as the present disparity of equipment exists , the historical and literary interests of our public school system will have a right to complain of unfair treatment .

		Meanwhile , to recur to the subject with which the present discussion start - ed out , much may be done during this period of internal school development by an intelli - gent cooperation between the existing resources of the two coordinate systems of the public school and the public library .

		MODERN LIBRARY ENTERPRISES .

		The most important characteristics of the library work of the past two years are the inauguration and enlargement of plans which will tend to more effective cooperation in actual work and to make the treasures stored up in our larger libraries available to students throughout the country .

		The coopera - tion between libraries during the quarter of a cen - tury previous has been largely that of laying the foundation which has made larger plans possible , and it is interesting to note how step by step the way has been prepared for the more extensive en - terprises of the present .

		In the early days , the days of small things , the attention of the librarian was largely directed to consideration of practical questions of housing , arranging , shelving , and caring for books ; to de - veloping methods of classification , cataloguing , and accounting ; and to regulations and conveniences for readers .

		The first steps towards cooperation consisted of an interchange of views at the meet - ings of the library associations and elsewhere , of a comparison of experiments and experiences , and of placing freely at the service of all any improve - ments or advances in methods and appliances .

		This interchange of views was of great value both in promoting a more efficient organization of libra - ries , and in securing a degree of uniformity of methods and materials without which further coop - eration would have been difficult .

		The first organized cooperative work was in the direction of supplying the indexes , catalogues , and manuals which are the necessary pathfinders for the investigator and student , and the tools of the library worker .

		Most important among the earlier publications of this sort were
Poole	PERSON	's '' Index to Periodical Literature '' and the Report of the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	on American libraries ,
1876	DATE	; the first embodying the work of a large number of leading libraries , and the second con - taining contributions from leading librarians .

		The
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, organized in
1876	DATE	, has been of great service to library work .

		It includes in its membership representatives of libraries in all parts of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There have also been organized , mostly within a few years past , twenty-two state associations affiliated with the national organization .


The Association	ORGANIZATION	has accomplished much through its committee on cooperation and its
Publishing Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter has issued a valuable series of 8p > ecial bibliographies , the latest and most important being the annotated list of books on American history , the expense of which has been borne by Mr.
George	PERSON	lies .

		A valuable feature of the bibliographies of the Asso - ciation is the annotation , giving critical estimates of the books included .

		A cooperative list of chil - dren 's books is now in preparation under the auspices of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, which will represent in its selection a consensus of the opinion of chil - dren 's librarians throughont the country .

		Valuable series of catalogue cards of important serials are being published by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, the copy being furnished by some of the larger libraries .

		The gift of SIOO.OOO from Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, which was announced at the last meeting , renders possible much additional work of great value , including , probably , the publication of a list of portraits and of various reference books which have long been projected .

		By far the most important cooperative library work , and one which will , to a large extent , make all similar work unnecessary , is the printing and distribution of the catalogue cards of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reasons for undertaking this great enterprise , and the methods adopted for carrying it oat , are clearly stated by the Librarian 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in a • ' Handbook of Card Distribution , '' bearing date of

		Briefly they are as follows : The catalogues of most American libraries , in - deed of all of any importance , are in card form .

		These cards , so familiar to most library users , are of bristol board and approximately the size of the smaller postal cards formerly in use .

		With a very few exceptions all the libraries in
America	LOCATION	use cat - alogue cards of the same size , this uniformity being one of the invaluable results of the earnest labors of the library pioneers , some of whom are still among our active librarians and are building upon the foundations so wisely laid .

		Catalogue cards are either written or typewritten , or , in the case of a very few of the largest libraries , are printed .

		Each book has a separate card for the author , the subject , and for the title if noteworthy .

		Some books may have fifty separate subject cards , some only one ; the average is perhaps five .

		The preparation of such a catalogue requires the services of an educated expert , of extensive knowledge and good judgment , to determine and state accurately the subjects treat - ed , and of a copyist to do the work of writing .

		This work each American library has heretofore been doing for itself , at great expense .

		As already noted , something had been done in the way of cooperation in this direction , but no comprehensive plan could be adopted or carried out from the lack of a central bureau adequately equipped for the special purpose in hand .

		This central bureau the
Library of Con	ORGANIZATION	- gress proposes to establish .

		While the immediate purpose of printing the cards is for its own use , it offers to furnish the cards as printed to all Ameri - can libraries at the cost of production , which , it is needless to say , is an insignificant fraction of the cost of producing them separately in each library .

		The advantages offered by the Library of Con - gress for this work are very great .

		It has the largest collection of books in the Western Hem - isphere , and is growing more rapidly than any other library .

		Of every copyrighted book issued in this country it receives free two copies , -- usually before the date of publication and in advance of other libraries , thus permitting the prompt printing of the cards .

		It receives a large amount of ma - terial in exchange for its own publications , and is at all times buying largely both current and non - current works , thus acquiring a large portion of the material acquired by other libraries .

		It has a modern printing plant , and an expert cataloguing force , and is equipped to produce a catalogue which shall embody the best cataloguing methods , and shall be so comprehensive as to meet most of the needs of other libraries throughout the country .

		An ingenious and elaborate scheme of distribution has been devised which insures the prompt delivery to all subscribing libraries .

		Libraries are permitted to subscribe for all cards issued , for cards covering any particular classes or subjects , or for cards for individual books .

		In addition to those sold to sub - scribers , a limited number of sets of the printed catalogue cards are deposited with certain libraries situated in various convenient parts of the country .

		These deposits are for the purpose of enabling students to ascertain whether works desired for reference are in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	; to pro- mote bibliographical work and uniformity in cata - loguing ; and to enable the depository and other libraries in the vicinity readily to order the cards for their own catalogues .

		The deposits are required to be arranged alphabetically in suitable cases , and made easily accessible to the public .

		The distribution and use of this great catalogue will , in addition to its other advantages , do much to promote another important work of mutual help - fulness among librarians , -- that of inter-library loans .

		The idea of loaning books to other libraries , even to those at a considerable distance , is not a new one .

		The most important work of this kind has been that done in connection with the Library of the Surgeon General at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This valu - able collection of books , consisting of 135,000 vol - umes , has been practically at the service of the medical profession throughout the country for many years .

		In the course of an address at the meet - ing of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1901	DATE	the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	described this work as follows : `` The library of the Surgeon General 's office -- the most comprehensive in the world within its special field -- sends its books to members of the medical profession throughout the
United States	LOCATION	, relieving just so much the burden upon local libraries ; and it has issued a catalogue which is not merely in form and method efficient , but is so nearly an ex - hibit of the entire literature of the medical sciences that it renders unnecessary duplication of cataloguing and analytical work within the field which it covers .

		This catalogue has conferred a general benefit not equalled by any bibliographic work within any other department of literature .

		It is per - haps the most eminent bibliographic work yet accomplished by any government .

		The cost of its mere publication , which is the cost chargeable to the general benefit , has al - ready exceeded
$ 250,000	MONEY	. ''

		The
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	cited this as a valuable precedent for the same extension of the field of usefulness of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	and of the other
Government	ORGANIZATION	libraries .

		The Library of Con - gress has since adopted the plan of loaning books to other libraries , and is practically placing its val - uable collection at the service of the student and investigator in any part of the country .

		The con - ditions of these loans are stated by the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	in an address before the American His - torical Association in
December , 1901	DATE	.

		`` If the book is in the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, if itisa ` book which it is not the duty of the local library to supply ; if it is not at the moment needed in
Washington	LOCATION	, and if it is transportable : it may , very probably , upon application , be lent to the local library for its use ... To justify the issue beyond the limits of
Washington	LOCATION	of a rare book , or a book important for refer - ence use and not a duplicate , there must be a somewhat ex - traordinary need .

		It must be on the part , not of ordinary readers , not of a student whose purpose is merely self - improvement , but of an investigator whose use of the book will tend to advance the general knowledge . ''

		A similar plan of mutual-accommodation by loans has prevailed among large libraries to a moderate but gradually increasing extent for years , and the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 courresy has frequently been extended by some of the larger libraries to smaller ones whose collections were not sofBcient to enable them to reciprocate in any way .

		In his report for 1899-1900 the libra - rian of
Harvard UniTersity	ORGANIZATION	speaks as follows : '' The usual nnmber of applications from other libraries , eBpeesally college libraries , and from scholars in different paits of the coontry , hare been reeeiTed , asd the library has keaa aUe to send avaj 475 Tolnmes in response to these re - ^ MlMs .

		This nnmber is somevhat larger than in any preTions Tear , bnt no instanoe of loes or injary has occarred .

		and it is IImiiIiI that the convenienoe of ooUese officerB ^ and of other ■ ahalan in
Cambridg	LOCATION	`` has not beaa mterfered with by the tamporary withdrawal of theaa Tohnaes . ''

		The last annaal report of the
Boston	LOCATION	Public Li - brary notes the loan of 461 volumes to libraries out `` ide the city , and similar work is reported by other large libraries .

		While the nnmber of inter-library loans has greatly increased daring the past year , and is likely to increase as it becomes more widely known that such privileges may be had , still they will probably always form an inconsiderable item of the work of our libraries .

		The plan , however , affords a farther possibility of great saving to oar libraries .

		If , as was point `` d out several years ago by the librarian of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, a systematic plan could be adopted , preferably under the direction and leader - ship of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, by which the eon - tents of our great libraries , particularly the valu - able sets of periodicals and collections of books on special subjects , might be made more generally available , a great saving of expenditure in unnec - essary duplication might be effected .

		Most of oar larger libraries have collections of great value upon s -LCB- > ecial subjects , such for instance as the Avery architectural collection at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, or the Riant collection at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are unique and can not be duplicated .

		By the distribution of catalogaes and a generous system of inter-library loans these collections may be pat largely at the service of sta - dents in all parts of the country .

		The prospects for developing the sporadic and somewhat informal work already being done in inter-library loans into a comprehensive and effect - ive system , also under the leadership of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, seems very bright .

		I stat `` one of the plans of the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	in his own words , quoting again from his address before the American Historical Association : '' The Library is endeavoring to aeqnire .

		not merely the most complete collection io the
United States	LOCATION	of books abont books , bat also the fullest information as to what books exist in particnlar collections other than its own .

		It is aoenmnlating this in the catalogaes of other libraries in book form and also in card form .

		It is receiving a copy of every eatalogne card printed by the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, the
Boston	LOCATION	, the
New York	LOCATION	, the
John Crerar	PERSON	Library ; and it hopes to receive in print or in manuscript cards covering significant material
IB	ORGANIZATION	other collections important to research .

		It will form thoan into a great card cat & logne of Americaii collections ontaide of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It may thus add to its efficiency as a bnraan of information by advising the inqairer , not merely what literature exists on a given subject , but where the particalar book he needs may most conveniently be found . ''

		It is not an altogether improbable dream that the time will come when the student in any part of the country may have from any collection , how - ever remote , the free use at his own fireside of any book which he may need for an important and worthy parpoee .

VKESK	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		May I have a bit of space to enter a brief apologia for some of my own verse recently critieised in your cfAr - umns .

		I am duly appreciative of the kind things yonr critic said of my verses , bat there is one little point I would like to clear up , as much for the cause of verse - making in general as on my own account .

		I am indicted for an '' incurably defective ear '' or an '' inexcusable carelessness . ''

		To either imputation I plead '' not g ^ ty , '' so please the Court .

		The charge is gathered from the last line in these : '' Till chastened love .

		Freed frooi the eloegioK dross of eartUy p -- iiw .

		Leap a akoodaK flame upward to Heaven . ''

		My critic kindly avers that '' it would have been so eaaj to write : * Leap like a shooting flame npward to Heaven . ' ''

		It would have been easy , bnt I did n't ; and I am not now convinced of the value of the proposed amendment .

		The rhythm of a verse is not marred by the lack of a syllable , provided the interval of its absence is a nat - nral pause or rest .

		I need not refer my critic to
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's '' Science of English Verse , '' wherein the rhythmic pause or rest in verse is carefully and sat - isfactorily exponnded .

		After the word '' Leap '' in the line tub Ule , there is a natural rest or pause of the voice , which fills the rhythmical necessity of the first measnre or foot .

		I assume of coarse that verse is addressed primarily to the ear .

		I even presume to think that my line without the '' easy '' amendment of the syllable `` like , '' is stronger and more organic .

		Perhaps the many '' similarly defective lines , '' which my critic imputes to me , may be found to come nnder the same rhythmic law .

		My interest in seeking to justify my verse in this regard is not merely per - sonal , bnt looks towards the vindication of the art of verse-making in general .

		Verse is too often subjected to the Umitations of the older criticism , which rigor - ously demanded its full quota of expressed syllables from every line .

		At the request of the editors of the volume , I would say that there was no idea of car - icature or cartoon in the mind of Mr.

		A Time-Serving Statesman .

		* No life of Harley having ever been pub - lished , though Swift intended to write one , Mr.
Roscoe	PERSON	has rendered history a service by giving a concise and impartial account of the man and his political career .

		A consider - able portion of the
Harley Papers	ORGANIZATION	, consisting mainly of letters to and from
Lord Harley	LOCATION	, has lately been published by the
Historical Manuscripts Commission	ORGANIZATION	; and it is mainly from these papers , and from other manuscript sources , that the biographer has taken the ma - terial for his book .

		Born in
1661	DATE	, the son of Sir
Edward Harley	PERSON	of
Herefordshire	LOCATION	,
Robert Harley	PERSON	early devel - oped a talent for politics , and was elected to the first parliament of
William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	.

		He showed his interest , but not his skill , in finance by starting the ill-fated
National Land Bank	ORGANIZATION	in
1696	DATE	, and later was one of the incorpo - rators of the still more disastrously unlucky
South Sea Company	LOCATION	.

		His knowledge of par - liamentary law , a study but little pursued at that time , procured him the speakership of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	in three successive parlia - ments .

		In
1704	DATE	he was appointed secretary of state for the northern department , still retain - ing his speakership -- a practice now unheard of -- until the dissolution of parliament in the following year .

		Entering public life as a Whig and a dissenter , self-interest had gradu - ally transformed him into a Tory and a sup - porter of the established church , though he attempted the impossible in posing as cham - pion of both parties at the same time .

		Friction with his Whig chief ,
Godolphin	ORGANIZATION	, led to his re - tiring from the cabinet in
1708	DATE	.

		Two years later a turn in the tide of popular favor en - abled Queen
Anne	PERSON	to restore him to her coun - cils in the capacity of lord chamberlain , then chancellor of the exchequer , and , soon after , lord high treasurer .

		As her most trusted adviser he became virtually prime minister , though the term was then a new one .

		A fur - ther proof of royal favor was his accession to the peerage as
Baron Harley	PERSON	,
Earl of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and
Earl Mortimer	PERSON	.

		The double earldom our author passes without comment , but a prob - able explanation is not far to seek .

		only nine years before , and the fear legt some less remote descendant of the family should appear to claim the lapsed title would seem to have caused the bestowal of an additional earl - dom upon the new peer .

		The War of the Spanish Succession was dragging out its weary length , and
Harley	PERSON	sided actively with the peace party and against
Marlborough	LOCATION	and his faction .

		Meeting with opposition in the Lords , he persuaded the queen to dismiss
Marlborough	LOCATION	from her service and to create twelve new peers in favor of peace ; and thus the desired cessation of hos - tilities was attained , the treaty of
Utrecht	LOCATION	,
two years later	DATE	, crowning this stroke of state - craft .

		Forfeiting , we know not how , the good will of Lady
Masham	PERSON	, the queen 's favorite ,
Harley	PERSON	was dismissed from office in
1714	DATE	.

		Some of the reasons alleged strike one as amusingly feminine .

		It was charged against him that he neglected all business ; that he was seldom to be understood ; that when he did explain himself he could not be depended upon ; that he never came to the queen at the time appointed , and when he did come he often came drunk ; and finally , to crown all , that he behaved toward her with bad manners , inde - cency , and disrespect .

		The queen died a few days later , and though
Harley	PERSON	spoke several times after this in parliament he soon retired to pursue his favorite avocation as a collector of books and manuscripts , and to enjoy the society of men of letters .

		But ere a year had passed his retirement was rudely broken in upon by his arrest on the charge of high treason , and he exchanged his voluntary seclu - sion for a forced one of twelve months in the Tower .

		Here he seems to have called litera - ture to his aid and to have passed the time in comparative cheerfulness .

		He was suspected of having secretly negotiated for the restora - tion of the Stuarts , and was also charged with having exerted an improper influence over the late queen .

		But his impeachment came to nothing , as the two houses disagreed upon methods of procedure , and he was acquitted by the Lords , his prosecutors failing to appear .

		He died in
1724	DATE	.

		As to
Harley	PERSON	's character , he has been branded by some of his contemporaries as the blackest of knaves , and extolled by others as a paragon of virtue .

		Probably his worst fail - ings were irresolution and insincerity .

		In an age of corruption among public servants he was comparatively blameless ; but he was an opportunist in politics , and , striving to win

		THE DIAL 79 and retain the favor of two opposite factions , he met the fate to be expected by one who tries to ride two horses going in contrary di - rections .

		He is entitled to our gratitude for the fine collection of manuscripts which , gath - ered at great expense , and added to by his son , finally came into the possession of the British Museum and so became accessible to the public .

		As to his own contributions to literature ,
Macaulay	PERSON	calls his verse '' more execrable than the bellman 's '' ; but
Swift	PERSON	says of his state papers that '' no man had more proper thoughts , or put them in so strong and clear a light . ''

		His intercourse with and pat - ronage of Swift and De Foe greatly increase one 's interest in him .

		He was the first to press the journalist into the service of politics , and to make the press a powerful factor in the attainment of political ends .

		De Foe 's fertile brain was to
Harley	PERSON	an inexhaustible mine of ingenious expedients , and the facile pen of the author of ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' was at his patron 's service as long as such service prom - ised an adequate remuneration .

		The always impecunious hack was not bashful in his calls for money .

		His eulogy of his benefactor seems to have been dictated by that species of grati - tude which consists in a lively sense of benefits to come ; and when the fountain of such favors ran dry he took to himself no shame for turn - ing , until its waters again began to play , to a patron of the opposite party .

		It was in con - nection with the union of
Scotland	LOCATION	and En - gland that he rendered Harley the greatest service , travelling from place to place `` with tireless energy , and writing meantime for the press a series of articles to promote the union .

		In a letter to his chief he summarizes , with characteristic clearness and brevity , the objects of his northern mission . ''

		I beg leave , though it be beginning at the wrong end , to set down how I understand my present business , as follows : -- ' `` 1 .

		To inform myself of the measures taking , or parties forming , against the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and apply myself to prevent them . '' '

		2 .

		In conversation and by all reasonable methods to dispose people 's minds to the

		3 .

		By writing or discourse , to answer any objec - tions , libels , or reflections on the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the English , or the Court , relating to the Union . '' '

		4 .

		To remove the jealousies and uneasiness of people about secret designs here against the Kirk . ' ''

		The letter closes with the customary petition for pecuniary aid .

		As it is far pleasanter , as well as more charitable , to think well of a man than other - wise , let us close with a few sentences upon
Harley	PERSON	from Swift 's '' Inquiry into the Be - haviour of the Queen 's
Last Ministry	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The writer 's language is in general laudatory , although not entirely free from self-contradic - tion . ''

		He was utterly a stranger to fear ; and eonse - qnently had a presence of mind upon all emergeneies .

		His liberality and contempt of money were such that he almost ruined his estate while he was in employ - ment ; yet his avarice for the public was so great that it neither consisted with the present corruptions of the age nor the circumstances of the time ... He was affable and courteous , extremely easy and agreeable in conversation , and altogether disengaged ; regular in his life , with great appearance of piety ; nor ever guilty of any expressions that could possibly tend to what was indecent or profane .

		His imperfections were at leaat as obvious , aJthough not so nnmerous , as his virtues .

		He had an air of secrecy in his manner and counte - nance , by no means proper for a great Minister , be - cause it warns all men to prepare against it .

		He often gave no answer at all , and very seldom a direct one .

		... I remember he was likewise heavily charged with the common court vice , of promising very liberally and seldom performing ; of which , although I can not alto - gether acquit him , yet I am confident his intentions were generally better than his disappointed solicitors would believe . ''

		MoDERx Spiritualism .

		* The story of modern Spiritualism is not only one of the most interesting , but also a deeply significant portion of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century .

		It is a source of grati - fication that this movement has at length found so able and so appreciative an historian as Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	.

		The qualities required for survey - ing a movement of this kind are many and rare to find in one individual .

		There is needed a patience that will take endless trouble to ascer - tain the facts , to draw distinctions between the various men and the various movements that together form so composite an aggregate ; there is needed a critical grasp to distinguish that which is important from that which is merely subsidiary ; and perhaps more fundamental than either , the capacity to interpret from a modern scientific standpoint the true inward - ness of the phenomena that are recorded .

		Although modern Spiritualism is commonly supposed to have be ^ nn about

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, pared to find that the forms of manifestations which then brought the movement into promi - nence have many and complex historical ante - cedents .

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	has no difficulty in tracing the close relation between modern Spiritualism and certain peculiar phenomena which at all times have found a place in human culture .

		The mediaeval tales of possession and witchcraft suggest the existence at that time of unusual individuals who in peculiar and some - what morbid mental states were apt to exhibit manifestations suggesting a spirit origin .

		Still more pertinent is the fact that at all periods the occurrence of mysterious knocks and rappings is recorded , likewise in the presence of such nervously constituted persons ; these form a common factor in the transcendental procedures recounted in the history of the occult , are , in - deed , a direct legacy from the witchcraft of the middle ages .

		The German name for them -- Poltergeist -- has come to be accepted as the best generic term to describe the fact with - out implying a theory .

		Such poltergeist rap - pings have frequently been heard , and often by persons of deeply religious belief ; the readiness to receive communication from the spirit land has transformed such rappings into messages and then into miracles .

		The family of
John Wesley	PERSON	-LRB- in
1717	DATE	-RRB- furnishes an illustration closely similar to that which appeared in the Fox family in
1848	DATE	.

		Another and very significant root of modern Spiritualism finds its way back into ancient times , but culminates particularly in the ap - pearance of
Mesmer	PERSON	and the Mesmerists who followed in the train of his teaching and his success .

		They contributed a theoretical factor by suggesting the possibility of peculiar forces with which some individuals might be sur - rounded , and by means of which they could transcend the normal sense-powers of mankind , see things at a distance , foretell the future , prescribe for ills , and in other ways be re - leased from the limitations of sense .

		Almost all of the feats which in later days the spiritu - alistic mediums performed -- excepting the physical manifestations -- can be traced back to the complex series of movements that fol - lowed the appearance of Mesmer . ''

		For geDerations the two streams of superstition have pursued a parallel course without meeting .

		The learned had believed in their fluids , the vulgar in their Poltergeists ; but whilst the magnetic sorauambule had for the most part eschewed physical phenomena , the naughty children had found the seeing of visions and trance-speaking too tame to satisfy their ambitions . ''

		Still another source of the spiritualistic doc - trines comes from the religious side , and finds analogy in the beliefs of
Swedenborg	PERSON	and his followers ; and finally , scattered elements which were absorbed by the spiritualists are to be found in the somewhat extravagant doctrines regarding the constitution of the world , its properties and destiny , which unorthodox in - dividuals have at all times been ready to set forth .

		It thus appears that modern Spiritualism is by no means an isolated phenomenon .

		There were spiritualists before the
Rochester	LOCATION	knock - ings , and one of these in particular ,
Andrew Jackson Davis	PERSON	, was directly influential in bringing about a spiritualistic interpretation of the mysterious rappings . ''

		The raps and movements of tables did not , in the ultimate analysis , originate anything ; they served merely to confirm a pre-existing belief . ''

		But it was unquestionably through the displacement of the knees and toes of some naughty children , that modern Spiritualism , which is in essence American Spiritualism , finds its starting point .

		There is no need of detailing the checkered career of those who thus originated a charac - teristic contribution to American life .

		From the very outset , the mediums ' methods were frequently exposed , and the exposure as fre - quently had little effect upon popular belief ; while the very tardy confession of the Fox sisters was made under circumstances that de - prived it of some of its evidential value .

		Many others were ready at once to add to the simple phenomena exhibited at
Rochester	LOCATION	; and the growth of the spiritualistic equipment in the way of manifestations was decided and inter - esting .

		The physical manifestations developed from the rappings to the movement of heavy objects without contact , and the mysterious introduction of all sorts of trifles , apparently as the gift of the gods ; then later and espe - cially in
England	LOCATION	, to the moving of tables apparently by their own will , and by such movements to the spelling out of messages ; to spirit writing and speaking through an entranced medium ; to the various forms of slate writing , spirit photography , materializa - tion of the actual forms of the departed , the transcendence of the physical laws , as by levi - tation or elongation of the medium himself ; to the mysterious release of the medium from knots and cords , and an array of similar '' cabinet '' performances .

		This American movement found its way to
England	LOCATION	and added to the particular forms of Spiritualism which were there already current .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81
England	LOCATION	reacted to the epidemic in a different and very characteristic way ; it was a '' pale reflection '' of the American propagandum .

		One of the peculiar English contributions was that of the combination of phrenology with Mesmerism , which was in turn incorporated with spiritualistic manifestations .

		Then , again , while in
America	LOCATION	the public performances by paid mediums were the rule , it was rather the private mediums by whose influence the move - ment grew in
England	LOCATION	.

		It also expanded very much more slowly , and probably would never have attained any great notoriety with - out the direct stimulus of the American me - diums .

		From this period of widest popularity .

		Spiritualism has in recent decades declined , and indeed changed its form .

		It became easy to perceive , as the years went by , a change of emphasis from the physical manifestation to the spiritual messages , so that , during the decline , less and less attention was paid to these trick-like performances of mediums , and more and more was the evidence for the spir - itualistic belief based upon utterances spoken in trance , or written down automatically by the '' control '' of the medium .

		That at va - rious times , including the most recent , eminent persons have given their adherence , not only to the genuineness of some of the physical phenomena , but likewise to the theoretical explanations offered , is a matter of common knowledge .

		The interest in
Spiritualism	LOCATION	, while now decidly a small part , when measured by numerical representatives , of what it was a few decades ago , can not be said to have really dis - appeared .

		There have always been many who have felt the possibility of some residual phe - nomena not explicable by ordinary laws , which in a way give some ground for a belief in the supernatural and which possibly demand a spiritual explanation .

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	himself records the experiences with Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	as among those suggesting such an unaccounted residuum .

		Such , in brief , is the story which Mr. Pod - more tells with great accuracy of detail , with great clearness of exposition , in his two notable volumes .

		But the work is not merely a his - tory ; it is a criticism .

		And the critic 's func - tion is quite as important as the historian 's .

		The criticism is logical and patient ; Mr. Pod - more 's attitude is distinctly a judicial one .

		He is more than usually open to conviction on almost any point of the evidence .

		He is willing to examine , and examine closely , forms of evidence which others would dismiss because of their obvious suspiciousness .

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	is also willing to concede that almost any form of manifestation which distinctly suggests something outside of the known world of law is worthy of such investigation .

		This attitude is the result of his association with investiga - tions in telepathy made by the English Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	may be said to be a moderate believer in telepathy ; and this fact becomes apparent at various points .

		Many persons will regret that a his - tory of Spiritualism so entirely adequate in all respects should be marred by an attitude towards this problem which most persons would consider distinctly unscientific and in this connection almost irrelevant .

		It should not be understood that Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	at all intrudes the telepathic hypothesis ; on the contrary , his self-restraint in this respect is most commend - able .

		But he presents the possibility of tele - pathy in such a way as to leave at least for a portion of the phenomena that mode of expla - nation as a final resource .

		In speaking of certain manifestations Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	says : '' The presumption in favor of fraud as an explanation of the physical phe - nomena is so overwhelming that it is not appreciably increased by a demonstration of fraud in any particular case . ''

		With that logical sentiment one may cordially agree .

		Had he abided by it literally , Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	would have found therein a justification for refusing to examine and refute a large num - ber of alleged phenomena , which none the less he does examine , as though the proofs offered were really worthy of investigation .

		True , this is an error which in the present instance may have happy results , for it forestalls any criticism of inadequate investigation .

		On the other hand it fails to appeal to those of accur - ate habits of thought as a worthy method for so able a critic as Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	to pursue .

		Apart from these defects , if such they be , the most careful critic will find little to object to in either of the volumes .

		Together they form not only an authoritative record of modern Spiritualism , but an unusually able and im - portant contribution to the history of culture in the nineteenth century .

		What then is the verdict of scientific in - quiry in regard to the true inwardness of the phenomena which are associated with modern Spiritualism ?

		The physical manifestations must be put down to fraud , predominantly to intentional fraud .

		So far as anything was done by the mediums that was noteworthy , it 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, was nothing more than a performance in which the stage conjuror would excel .

		At times this explanation appears a little strained and seems to outrage one 's faith in humanity .

		It seems harsh to assign fraud without apparent motive ; but in reality the investigation reveals motives for such deception that are a distinct contribution to the psychology of the subject .

		Take the most favorable case discussed in Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	's book , -- the phenomena occuring in the presence of
William Stainton Moses	PERSON	, a man of apparently unimpeachable character , who for many was a pillar of the faith and whose mediumship is voluminously recorded in the pages of the Proceedings of the Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	finds it his duty , and fortunately has the courage , to record that the only conclusion is '' that it was he who tilted the table and produced the raps : that the scents , the seed pearls , and the Parian statuettes were brought into the room in his pockets ; and that the spirit-lights were , in fact , nothing more than bottles of phos - phorised oil . ''

		The mitigating sentence in the epitaph is the query whether these and other symptoms do not suggest the more charitable hypothesis that Mr.
Moses	PERSON	was at least abnor - mal if not of unsound mind .

		Apart from fraud , which in this connection certainly covers a multitude of ills , we must add the proven powers of creating miracles to be ascribed to faulty observation , still faultier memory , prejudice , and credulity .

		When we are told of a medium sitting with one Mrs.
Guppy	PERSON	'' near the fire making up her accounts , when suddenly looking up she found that her companion had disappeared , leaving a slight haze near the ceiling '' ; that the husband of Mrs.
Guppy	PERSON	on being informed of this mishap '' remarked that no doubts the spirits had taken her , and shortly afterwards went down to supper '' ; and that it was later discovered that the last word written on her accounts before the spiritual flight was '' onions , '' -- we enter an atmosphere of credulity that has no relation to the world in which sanity moves .

		From similar sources we read of a baby writing spirit - guided messages ; and in far more cultured circles we have records of the floating out of one window and the return through another of the medium 's body ; while more pitiable than either is the picture of a German professor -- whose only excuse would be the enfeeblement of old age -- sitting down with a professional slate-writing expert and hoping that by spirit aid and the fourth dimension of space the direction of the spiral of some snail shells would be reversed .

		To fraud and credulity we must add self - deception , which in its most pronounced form is to be found in connection with trance states and other types of automatic action .

		In this connection psychology has found a means of rationalising the associations to be formed with the term '' medium '' so far as the term is freed from the taint of the above sources of error .

		This is a small result , and one much more sanely to be arrived at in other ways , for so much tedious investigation .

		To these as the main sources of explanation -- and neglecting the superstition and extravagance of belief which acts both as cause and as effect in the spiritualistic propagandum -- may be added some minor and yet suggestive corolla - ries .

		In the end , the movement must be classified among the records of human error and vagary , with enough psychological worth mingled with it to rescue it from complete vacuity .

		Possibly this view is the outcome of one 's personal temperament ; for Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	's final words , after all this painstaking and pro- longed recounting of nauseous fraud , pitiable deception , and vulgar pretense , are a caution that after all there may be still some jewel in the rubbish-heap ; and that we should take a lesson from the persistent neglect of the valu - able phenomena of hypnotism -- which neglect , however , presents no true analogy to the present case -- and not * ' for the second time , throw away the baby with the water from the bath .

		THE DIAL 83 of the student of North American birds , ren - dering the identification of species inhabiting any quarter of the vast stretch of territory lying between the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and
Pacific	LOCATION	seas an easy and agreeable matter .

		Mra .


Bailey	PERSON	was admirably fitted for the work she has now accomplished .

		A sister of Dr.
C. Hart Merriam	PERSON	, director of the
United States Biological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, she has had the influence of scientific methods in all her inves - tigations in the realms of natural history .

		For considerable periods she has been a resi - dent or a traveller in the
Western States	LOCATION	, not seldom making one of the party engaged under Dr.
Merriam	PERSON	in studying the fauna in dif - ferent sections , and sharing in the labors , the pleasures , the freedom and restrictions of camp life .

		For years past she has filled a place among the authorities in her favorite science , her several text-books being approved as gen - uine contributions to American ornithology .

		This latest of her publications crowns her achievements in this direction , and is a noble monument to her ability and tireless industry .

		It is an immense territory which her hand - book covers , extending from the 100th to the 125th meridian and from the Canadian to the Mexican boundaries ; and we may not be sur - prised at the richness of its avi fauna .

		It includes nearly eight hundred bird forms , sur - passing the number found in the
Eastern States	LOCATION	by more than three hundred .

		Five families are embraced in its catalogue which have no representative in the
East	LOCATION	.

		It excites our envy to read the description of sixteen species of humming-birds dwelling within the area surveyed by Mrs.
Bailey	PERSON	, while the
East	LOCATION	has but one .

		We have likewise a single king - fisher ; and three frequent the
Western States	LOCATION	.

		Again , of the great sparrow family , numbering 550 members altogether , 128 reside west of the hundredth meridian , and only 53 east of it .

		Not by any means do all the Western birds differ materially from those in the
Eastern States	LOCATION	.

		Many are common to both regions , while others are marked by such slight degrees of dissimilarity as to be ranked merely as varieties .

		Our robin , for example , ranges to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , bat loses meantime some characteristics of its
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	form ; while , as Mrs.
Bailey	PERSON	relates , it experiences a decided change in its habits .

		With us it is the • • familiar bird of the door-yard , '' rejoicing us with its friendly companionship .

		In the West it is a shy , wild creature , choosing its home in retired places , rarely betraying its presence by an out - break of song , and scurrying in affright to the thicket at the approach of a human footstep .

		Mrs.
Bailey	PERSON	leads her readers to the identi - fication of species by ample and well-defined keys .

		She aids them also by choice illustra - tions , comprising thirty-three full-page plates by Mr.
Louis Agassiz Fuertes	PERSON	, and over six hundred cuts in the text .

		The bits of biogra - phy accompanying the summaries of technical characters , distribution , food , and nesting habits , compress with ingenious art the most desirable facts into the limited space allowed .

		These are not more noteworthy for the intelli - gence conveyed than for the felicitous language employed .

		Mrs.
Bailey	PERSON	is fortunate in having the cooperation of her husband in her scientific work .

		For twenty years Mr.
Vernon Bailey	PERSON	has been employed in the
United States	LOCATION	Sur - vey , becoming an adept in field research as in the use of the pen .

		A liberal part of the bio - graphical matter presented in the book under review bears his signature , and , like the work of the chief author , is in a distinctively original vein .

		Neither writer is secondary to the other .

		They are co-partners in a common -- or , rather , uncommon -- fund of knowledge and talent .

		Nearly a hundred introductory pages of the handbook are occupied with directions for the preservation of bird skins and eggs : with notes on bird protection , migration , and life zones , with local bird lists , and other valuable matter prepared by various competent ornith - ologists .

		Nothing is lacking to complete the interest and service of the volume .

Paris	LOCATION	insurrection , for example , may set it in its true relations , may add an element of interpretation which even a familiarity with all the details can not supply .

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, the Mercure de
France	LOCATION	.

		A Protestant aristo - crat of the republic of
Geneva	LOCATION	, he brought a clear though unsympathetic intelligence to the study of French political conditions .

		If we may altogether trust a letter written when he had cause to doubt the capacity of the French for self-government , he could not from the outset see the utility of the Revolution .

		He had been convinced , he affirmed , that begun '' among corrupt men , in a nation full of pre - sumption and frivolity , ardent but perverted , it would become the scourge of
Europe	LOCATION	after bemg that of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		In the
summer of 1789	DATE	he discovered that he had exchanged one sort of censorship for another , and that the warnings of district committees and Palais Royal groups might be even more ominous than those of the king 's officers .

		It is not surprising that , although a republican , he should in the stress of conflict have been gradually driven into the position of a '' rude '' champion of strong government .

		As he criti - cised the Revolution in the spirit of the older royalists like
Mounier	PERSON	and
Malouet	PERSON	, his jour - nalistic career ended abruptly in
1792	DATE	, and he crossed the frontier to aid the king 's cause at the headquarters of the allies .

		He did not take up journalism again until
1797	DATE	, when he was hunted out of
Switzerland	LOCATION	by the Directory .

		In
London	LOCATION	, during the short interval of life that re - mained , he created the Mercure Britannique .

		As a biography , the work of Mr.
Bernard Mallet	PERSON	is more successful in the description of the earlier periods of
Mallet du Pan	ORGANIZATION	's life and of bis last days than in its treatment of the years from
1793	DATE	to
1797	DATE	.

		During these years he acted as '' consulting physician '' to the allies .

		It was a dreary business .

		His advice was not palatable , although he spiced it with the strongest denunciations of the French Revolutionists and all their works .

		A political correspondence of this sort is difficult to treat in such a manner that its purposes may be clearly defined and its weight in the politics of the time truly estimated .

		One can hardly escape the feeling that Mr.
Mallet	PERSON	has occa - sionally approached his subject in the filial rather than in the historical spirit .

		There is too much similarity of tone and color in the figure and in the background .

		Possibly this effect arises from his substantial agreement with his ancestor 's point of view and conclu - sions .

		It is certainly not due to any lack of fairmindedness , for he acknowledges in several cases that Mallet du Pan was mistaken , or ill - advised , or unduly influenced by the spirit of the struggle .

		He says the Revolution ended by throwing him '' into a position of political antagonism to
France	LOCATION	, and its excesses betrayed him into expressing his opinions of the national character in harsh and unjust terms . ''

		But he explains this by remarking that '' some exag - geration and violence of tone ... are certain to be found in a series of secret memoranda presented to a Cabinet , and published , as his - torical criticism demands , in the exact form in which they were written . ''

		To what lengths
Mallet du Pan	ORGANIZATION	's prejudices carried him , his biographer is hardly able fully to appreciate ; for his own conception of the Thermidorian period and of the
Directory	ORGANIZATION	reveals an antagonism not less uncompromising .

		French politics were not at this time so uni - formly ignoble as he pictures .

		Furthermore , it is not altogether clear why '' exaggeration and violence of tone '' are to be expected in letters to '' Cabinets . ''

		The allies sought from their agents facts rather than effective denun - ciations .

		Unhappily Mallet du Pan listened too readily to rumors that fell in with his notions of the condition of
France	LOCATION	.

		His picture of
Robespierre	LOCATION	's daily life , -LRB- inserted in a description of the members of the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, -RRB- must have stirred the readers of his letters more than it instructed them .

		Among other things , it says : '' Today he is haggard , with hollow eyes and livid face , with restless and savage looks , and a countenance bearing the impress of crime and remorse .

		Tormented with terror , he is always escorted by three chosen sans-culottes , armed to the teeth , who accompany him in his carriage ; returning to his beggarly abode , he shuts himself and barricades himself within it , and opens the door only with the most extreme precautions .

		If he dines out , it is never without laying his two pistols on the table , one at each side of his plate ; no servant may stand behind his chair ; he partakes of no dish without one of the guests having eaten it before him ; he casts troubled and suspicious glances on all around him . ''

		In reading this biography one can not avoid the conclusion that Mallet du Pan was the dupe of his
august	DATE	correspondents , just as he had been of the allies in
July , 1792	DATE	, when he undertook to clarify their minds upon the proper policy to be pursued in an armed inter - vention in
France	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , he pathetically confessed in
1797	DATE	that he would prefer to write for the public than for all the kings of the earth .

		When he takes up his broken career as a journalist he recaptures the sym - pathy of the reader .

		He is no longer under the illusion that by the sheer force of reasoning he can unite all
Europe	LOCATION	in an unselfish defense

		THE DTAL 85 of the established order against the destructive Revolutionary propaganda , but he is resolved not to withdraw from the fight so long as he has the strength to wield the pen .

		Mallet dn Pan was more successful in expos - ing weakness , folly , and injustice , than in marking out and advocating a policy which could lead to the mastery of the situation .

		Truth lost none of its sombre as -RSB- > ects through his exposition .

		Men were readier to admire his perspicacity than to accept his leadership .

		Even his friends the ' ■ Monarchiens '' refused to make their opposition as persistent as did he .

		Of necessity , there must be a difference of opinion upon the value of his criticisms , although his newspaper and his letters will remain indispensable for the study of one phase of French opinion .

		It is not surprising that his picture of the Revolution was eulogized by
Taine	PERSON	.

		for , as
M. Monod	ORGANIZATION	remarked some years ago ,
Taine	PERSON	found among these papers whole pages which might have been taken from '' The Modern Regime . ''

		After all , the chief value of his criticisms is the fact that the daily spectacle of the Revolution should have pro- duced such an impression upon a mind like his .

		Among the subjects of particular interest touched in this biography are Mallet du Pan 's relations with
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	at
Ferney	LOCATION	, the incidents of his personal life at
Paris	LOCATION	, and the difficul - ties that met him in attempting to establish himself in
London	LOCATION	.

		There is a bibliography of his published writings and of the books written upon him .

		It would have been well to note for the sake of English readers , that the work of M. Sayons appeared in translation '' ''

		The Limpid Lakes of Death '' woald be a closer equivalent , bat a less happy one , for the original title of this work , which dates from about two years back .

		It is a very strong piece of wri - ting , saecessfol in the achievement of a clearly - defined um .

		That aim may not commend itself to all , because it is the portrayal of a somewhat morbid feminine type , and because in that portrayal it becomes necessary to bring us into close contact with the seamy side of life and to exhibit the baser possibilities of a woman 's nature .

		The author is a realist in that be shrinks from nothing that is really needful for his purpose , but he has also the artist 's instinct of reticence , and this saves him at more than one critical janetare .

		His plainness of speech may be found offensive , but it must be admitted even by those who object to it that the offense is not wanton , and is deliberate only in the sense that it is demanded by the exigencies of the author 's theme . '

		The heroine , who is also the sole figure of interest in the entire work , is drawn from her child - hood up .

		She is a woman of delicately sensual predisposition , who early learns to fear her own in - stincts and to straggle against them , yet who even - tually is weak enough to yield , and who in conse - quence falls into the lowest depths of degradation .

		For her final rescue the author invokes the motive of mysticism , and works for her a spiritaal regen - eration . ''

		How she sought the cool deeps wherein is deliverance , and how deliverance eime to her '' -- these are almost the first words of the book , and their promise sustains us through all the wretched - ness that follows .

		We may not accept the outcome as probable from the premises , but it is a solution that has oecarred more than once in human life , and it seems to embody a sincerely maintained point of view on the part of Dr. van E ^ en .

		When we contrast the depth and seriousness of this novel with the trivialities and superficialities upon which nearly every English and Aa w ka n novel in oar present list depends for interest , our racial pride is not exactly flattered .

		86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, duction8 of the day in oar own country .

		In both cases the lesson is clear enough ; while the novelists and the dramatists of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	countries -LRB- even the smaller ones -RRB- are trying to give their work the stamp of vital truth , our own writers in these fields are chiefly concerned with entertain - ment , and are content to be merely graceful , or clever , or ingenious .

		The literature which permits such qualities to become more than adjuncts in its task is the victim of a dry rot which threatens its very existence .

		Much of our most noteworthy recent work has been done in historical fiction , and yet the best of it seems insignificant when contrasted with the work of the great
Continental	ORGANIZATION	writers .

		There is
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	, for example , whose books are almost unknown to us , although they are unsurpassed in the breadth of vital knowledge with which they depict the period of the
Volkerwanderung	PERSON	and the early strife of the Roman Empire with the hordes of `` the Goth and the shameless Hun . ''

		We men - tion this great writer of historical romance because Miss
Mary J. Safford	PERSON	has just translated '' Bissula , '' one of his later works , which deals with the Roman invasion of the country about
Lake Constance	PERSON	, and ends with the discomfiture and final repulse of the imperial legions . ''

		A Captive of the Roman Eagles '' is the title given to this translation , which may be commended as a piece of respectable workmanship , although hardly inspired .

		The poet
Ausonins	PERSON	is one of the leading characters in this work , and his love for a fair daughter of the Alemanni , contrasted with the rival love of a young chieftain of her own people , provides the main element of romantic in - terest .

		But the book has other interests also , inter - ests that illuminate the life of the whole period , and make us feel that we are borne along by the cen - tral current of early European history .

		The eru - dition of the author is of the most solid type , but he knows how to subdue it to artistic service .

		The posthumous novel , '' No Other Way '' is pre - sumably the last work of fiction that we shall have from the late
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		It is a story of the
London	LOCATION	which the author knew so well , and of the eighteenth century , with the customs and institu - tions of which he was so intimately acquainted .

		The old theme of imprisonment for debt , a favorite with so many of the earlier novelists , provides the book with its chief interest , and illustrates anew the similarity between
Besant	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, in materials , motives , and methods .

		The plot of the story must be called strained , if not improbable .

		A gentle - woman in distress , and in danger of arrest by her creditors , resorts to
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	for a husband , be - cause the law will save her from the debtor 's prison if she be married .

		The only person found available for her is a desperate negro criminal , who is to be hanged in a day or two .

		Since there seems to be `` no other way '' out of her plight , she is married to this man , and then leaves him to his fate .

		Since we are concerned with a novel and not with real life , it ia a matter of course that the criminal should escape hanging , and return in a later chapter to plague the heroine .

		The situation thus created is quite exciting , but it must be admitted that the con - ception upon which the novel is based is rather repulsive , and would be intolerable were we not certain that in Sir
Walter	PERSON	's hands the plot would be managed in a way to spare our susceptibilities .

		Mr. ''
Anthony Hope	PERSON	'' is hardly to be congratu - lated on '' The Intrusions of Peggy . ''

		There is abundant cleverness in the book , and the sort of brill - iant sophisticated dialogue at which Mr.
Hawkins	PERSON	has few equals , but there is not the sustained novel - interest that we are justified in expecting from the author of '' The Prisoner of Zenda '' and '' Tristram of Blent . ''

		Peggy is a very satisfactory person in - deed , but although she gives the book its title , her place in the plot is subordinate .

		The two chief characters are a young widow who gets into finan - cial difiiculties and a man of middle age whom she eventually marries .

		Neither of these persons can be called sympathetic .

		The man is miserly , the most unpardonable of all heroic attributes , and the woman is so absolutely devoid of serious purpose that the reader does not greatly care when she be - comes stupidly involved in debt through a reckless speculation .

		There is a feeling that she deserves all that she gets , and perhaps more .

		Of course there is much delicate comedy in the treatment of the situation , and keen satire of English society and its characteristic types .

		But of human interest in any deep sense there is very little , and there is not even the substitute of purely romantic interest that we are willing to accept upon occasion .

		The author of '' The Column '' does not seem to have advanced upon that striking first book in the composition of '' Love with Honour . ''

		Mr.
Marriott	PERSON	has constructed a complicated and ingenious plot , which holds us fairly in suspense until near the close , and he has given us faithful studies of sev - eral rather unusual types of character , but he has missed the note of sentimental idealism which was the chief charm of the earlier novel .

		His charac - ters make disagreeable company , on the whole , and remind us a little of the sort of people who figure in the fictions of `` Benjamin Swift , '' from whose methods the author seems to have taken a lesson , to the detriment of his own peculiar talent .

		This is the sort of book of which one forgets the very sub - stance a few weeks after it has been put aside .

		By way of a brief introductory characterization of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' The Disentanglers , '' we may say that it revives the sensations with which we first read '' The New Arabian Nights , '' but with the deeper interest that might have attached to that romantic masterpiece had it embodied suggestions from the method of
Grant Allen	ORGANIZATION	and of the creator of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	.

		This is surely enough to commend it to the judicious , were anything needed beyond the name of the author .

		The disentanglers are two young men , belonging to good society but impecunious , who cast about for some means of `` raising the wind . ''

		The result is a partnership ,
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIi 87 and the formation of a bareaa for giring advice to people who have become entangled in sentimental or matrimonial complications .

		Counsel in these delicate matters is discreetly and confidentially provided by the bareaa , and active measures are taken for the disentanglement of the social knots offered for treatment .

		The main reliance is an ingenious system of counter-irritants whereby , for example , the wealthy bachelor who is bent upon marrying his cook , to the disgust of the expectant heirs , is gently diverted from his purpose by being exposed to the charms of a young woman who acts as the agent of the bureau .

		These agents , it should be added , are supposed to be sentimentally immune , so that they can withdraw unscathed from the scene of operations when their work is done .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's application of this idea results in a series of the most surprising stories imaginable -- stories which start out under prosaic conditions , and sud - denly plange into the wildest and most romantic sensationalism .

		The stories are brilliant both as to style and invention , besides abounding in sly allo - sions and satirical touches that will be caviare to the general , but a source of keen delight to those who have an extensive acquaintance with the writ - ings of the gentleman -LRB- or syndicate ? -RRB-

		known as Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		We may remark , incidentally , that the disentanglers of this story become entan - gled themselves -- happily and for good -- before the end is reached .

		Mr.
J. Storer Clouston	PERSON	is the author of a strange medley of semi-romantic and humorous incident which he calls '' The Adventures of M. d' Haricot . ''

		It tells of a Frenchman in
London	LOCATION	, living as an exile , although his banishment from home seems to be self-imposed , for a person of his character and temperament could not well be a dangerous con - spirator against the French government .

		The advertisements describe the book as a compound of '' rollicking fun , '' but we have read it from cover to cover without discovering anything of the sort .

		Monsieur d' Haricot becomes mildly amus - ing at times , especially in his relations with the gentler sex , but he never stirs the reader to genuine mirth .

		One gets the impression that the author had an excellent chance for effective work , and just missed it . ''

		A Doffed Coronet '' is a story in the form of autobiography .

		The writer pretends to be , and very likely is , the wife of an English diplomat attached to the Egyptian court in the days just after the Arabi rebellion .

		It is with the
Cairo	LOCATION	of twenty years ago , social , official , and political , that the first half of the book is concerned .

		It is clearly written from the inside , and by a woman who had unusual opportunities to observe matters of a kind that do not come to the knowledge of the general public .

		Midway in the book the scene shifts to
America	LOCATION	, for the diplomat loses his fortune through an ill-advised speculation , and both he and his wife are too proud to seek to hold their position in European society under these altered circum - stances .

		So these people , who have associated with the great ones of earth , and who have had a part in the making of history , exile themselves to the new world , and adapt themselves , not without difficulty , to the changed conditions of their exist - ence .

		A certain familiarity with American ways and speech indicates that this part of the book also has some basis of actual observation , yet some of the characterizations are so grotesque that they can not be based upon anything but imagination .

		The title-page informs us that this is * ' a true story , '' and much of it bears the visible stamp of truth .

		It certainly is not a novel in the ordinary sen ^ e , for no work of conscious invention would ever lead to such an anti-climax as is here pre - sented .

		It is a puzzling performance , but one well worth examination for its general cleverness , and for the brilliant picture of Egyptian life contained in the op > ening chapters .

		When '' The Prisoner of Zenda '' was set loose about ten years ago , its author little imagined the brood of imitations that would follow in its train .

		So familiar has the type since become that we may speak of a '' Zenda '' romance with perfect confi - dence in the intelligibility of the designation .

		Just now we have before us two new examples of this sort of invention , notable , however , for the same variant feature .

		In both cases , the hero gets the princess at last ; in the one case because the princess is determined to have him at any cost , and in the other because the prince is conveniently killed in an insurrection .

		Mr.
John R. Carling	PERSON	's '' The Shadow of the Czar '' opens mysteriously on the coast of
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, where hero and heroine meet under singularly romantic circumstances .

		Then the scene is transferred to the Polish principality which is the real centre of the action .

		The territory is one which the Czar -LRB-
Nicholas	PERSON	I. -RRB- seeks to annex .

		The hand of the princess is sought by a wicked duke , who , failing in his suit , plays into the hands of the
Bussian	PERSON	court , and nearly accomplishes the ex - tinction of the principality .

		But the hero , being an Englishman , is necessarily triumphant in the end , the wicked duke is slain , and even the Czar is out - witted .

		This is a particularly lively story , and ranks a trifle above the usual sensational level of its class . '

		• The Garden of Lies , '' by Mr.
Justus Miles Forman	PERSON	, is about a Balkan principality also endan - gered by Russian designs .

		The prince is married to an American wife , who shortly after becoming a princess has a severe illness from which she re - covers with a total lapse of memory for recent hap - penings .

		She is in
Paris	LOCATION	under a physician 's care , and her husband is in the
Balkans	LOCATION	combating Rus - sian intrigue .

		She is informed that she has a husband , and naturally wishes to make his acquaint - ance .

		Her condition of mind is such that it be - comes imperative to provide a husband of some sort , since the legal one is supposedly unable to come to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In this emergency , a rollicking Irish adventurer is persuaded to enact the role on -
88	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, til such time as the prince may be able to appear in person .

		Unfortunately for the plot , the
Irish	LOCATION	- man is a gentleman of parts , with a most persuasive gift for love-making .

		The natural result is that the two straightway became enamoured of one another .

		At this juncture the prince appears unexpectedly and is far from pleased with the state of affairs .

		Then there is an abduction of the princess by agents of the Russian party , a thrilling rescue by her Irish lover , and a mix-up all around .

		She learns the trick that has been played upon her , tries to be indignant and forget her new-found love , and miserably fails .

		The prince then goes back to quell an insurrection , gets killed in the scrimmage , while the Irishman -LRB- who has accom - panied him -RRB- miraculously escapes , and returns to his love , now widowed and free to follow the dic - tates of her heart .

		It is a good deal of a story altogether , and may be recommended for enter - tainment .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's `` Cecilia '' is a story of modern
Rome	LOCATION	, and in that aspect has points of interest .

		The author knows
Rome	LOCATION	and its society better than he knows anything else , and his Roman scenes and fig - ures are always carefully studied .

		But here commen - dation of the new novel must cease , for it tells no story worth the telling , while for its romantic interest reliance is had upon the sort of supernaturalism for which Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has a weakness , and which he would evidently have us take seriously .

		It is curi - ous how the telepathic delusion takes possession of some minds that are well equipped and rational up - on most subjects .

		Even when the many unneces - sary pages are skipped , this novel seems incapable of arousing more than a languid interest .

		`` The Taskmasters , '' by Mr.
George Kibbe Tur	PERSON	- ner , is the first volume of the '' First Novel Series '' that has been projected by a leading firm of pub - lishers .

		We may say at once that the series will be in no danger of failure if it can be maintained up - on the level of this novel .

		The theme is found in the political and business life of a
New England	LOCATION	fac - tory town , and , although well worn in its main out - lines , this theme is here set forth with a degree of judgment and literary skill that has not often been equalled .

		It is a book of honest and manly ideals presented without exaggeration or the appeal of false sentiment .

		On the political side , it exhibits the corrupting influence of a great employer of labor upon the community which he dominates by his wealth , and exposes the hypocrisies of the protective system .

		But at the same time it presents the case of the employer with fairness , and does not gloss over the faults of the employed .

		In the unending struggle for the amelioration of social conditions , the author sees no profit in radical measures , and is too clear-sighted to denounce the selfishness of capital - ism as the sole cause of the present unsatisfactory relations .

		His outlook is expressed in a fine passage which comes near the close of the book , and which we wish to reproduce . ''

		A new sound has come into the land these last few years -- the voice of the little h priori thinker , with his tinsel , ready-made universe , formed in a night from the discarded timber of a hundred familiar systems of the workingphilosophers of a century ; the cry of the bearded apostle of the future , a strange new hybrid of a prophet and a walking delegate ; an inventor of another new Utopia , wailing in the market place because mankind refu - ses all at once to step aboard his new flying machine , and be whisked away across the yawning precipi - ces of the unknown to regions of ineffable bliss .

		All these things have their places in the great econ - omy of nature , no doubt , -- a bare-headed socialist calling beneath the electric light across the half deserted street ; a religious sentimentalist harangu - ing his weekly parcel of old maids in the resounding vestry of a church ; a pismire shouting from his blade of grass for a fixed star to change its course .

		Meanwhile society moves on in its great orbit .

		Compromise succeeds compromise , one little gain another -- new conditions , new privileges , new generations , better , more intelligent than the old ; new inventions , changing the whole face of contin - ents ; society working out its vast experiments -- in the great cities , in these hundred towns and villages of ours -- the tremendous laboratories of the experi - ence of mankind , forming slowly , painfully , but magnificently , the new order of things under our very eyes . ''

		It is welcome to find a book , dealing with the social problem in this spirit , that is perme - ated by as sound a social philosophy .

		Considered simply as a story , the book is well-planned and deeply interesting .

		Its studies of the baser types that figure in local politics are convincingly realized ; the figures of hero and heroine are truthfully drawn , and the grim climax of the plot , with the tragic death of the magnate in the very hour of his politi - cal triumph , is managed with a degree of skill that promises much for the future of this young writer .

		He tells his story directly , with nervous animation , and without resort to the weakly sentiment in which most young writers upon these themes take refuge .

		The book is a strong and wholesome performance , and deserves to be widely read .

		Another novel that plunges us into the political life of recent years is Mr.
Mark Lee Luther	PERSON	's '' The Henchman . ''

		Here the scene is a
New York	LOCATION	town and , as in the novel just reviewed , the ambi - tion of a local leader to become Governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is the central motive of the narrative .

		He is a politician of a coarse type , ' who pulls wires , makes demagogic speeches , and enters into corrupt bargains for the achievement of his purpose , and by these methods he climbs the ladder round by round until his ambition is achieved .

		But during this rake 's progress of his political career a curious thing is going on .

		There are certain latent possi - bilities of the finer sort in his nature , and these gradually come to the surface , while the responsi - bilities of power exert upon him a sobering and even uplifting influence .

		He reaches a point at which the step from the governorship to the presi - dency seems to be within his reach , but it is a step
1903	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 89 that may only be taken at the price of absolate 8ab - servieney to the leader of the party machine .

		And the process of anconscioas apvrard growth has so stiffened the moral fibre of the governor that in the critical hoar he ref ages sabmission , and deliberately throws away his opportanity .

		We are thos left at the end with a feeling of admiration for the man whose eonrse ap to this time has seemed despicable and witboat redeeming virtoes .

		We would not say that the ease of this man offers a typical example of the career of the saceessfal American politician , bat we believe that the sort of growth it describes does some - times go on , and that it represents a possible eneoar - aging aspect of the conditions that obtain in oar political cesspwol .

		As a pictare of recent
New York	LOCATION	politics , the book is closely studied from the life , and on more than one occasion we read the name of some real person for that of the fictitioas char - acter of the author 's devising .

		The story of a boy whose childhood is beset by all sorts of difficulties , and who by sheer force of intellect and character rises superior to his sor - ronndings , and makes for himself both name and position , is what Mr.
George A. Powles	PERSON	gives as in ''
Oliver Langton	PERSON	. ''

		Stories of this type are mainly interesting in proportion to their sincerity and their sympathetic knowledge of the life depicted .

		These qualities go far , in the present instance , to make ap for amatearishness and the lack of tech - nical equipment .

		The scene of the story is rural
Upper Canada	LOCATION	, and the time is the period of the creation and first years of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have here an intimate picture of provincial life , in which nothing is spared us of the ftettiness and prejudice in religious and social matters , or of the ignorant materialism of the time and place .

		With all thia photographic detail the author has combined s vein of worthy idealism , although his treatment suffers somewhat from the prominence of the didactic element Historical romance has rather neglected the later stages of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, with the exception of the surrender at
Yorktown	LOCATION	.

		The campaign in the
Carolinas	LOCATION	and through
Virginia	LOCATION	is , no doubt , less interesting because less significant than the operations about the three chief cities or in the valley of the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		In writing - ` The Master of Appleby , '' Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	has chosen for his theme this less familiar phase of the
Revo	ORGANIZATION	- lution , the scene being laid in and around
Meck	PERSON	- lenburg -LRB- of the mythical Declaration -RRB- for the most part .

		Otherwise , the romance is constructed of conventional material , and is not much differentiated from others of its class , unless it be by the sur - prising number and variety of the hero 's adventures and escapes .

		It is a novel of more than the com - mon length , and of fairly sustained interest .

		Stories of the Civil War we have had a-plenty of late years , and most of them could be easily spared , but we should be sorry to spare as good a story as '' The Whirlwind , '' by Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	.

		The hero is a country boy who grows ap under condi - tions of abject poverty , and who has to straggle to gain even the beginnings of an education .

		But he has purpose , and character , and will , and makes himself first a country lawyer , then a soldier and officer in the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	army , then a representative and a senator , and finally a popular presidential candidate , who would probably have won the elec - tion had he not been struck down by the hand of the assassin .

		The author has had both
Lincoln	LOCATION	and
Garfield	PERSON	in mind in drawing this composite portrait of soldier and statesman , although , of course , he departs widely from the actual history of either man .

		The war chapters take us from
Missouri	LOCATION	to
Greorgia	LOCATION	, and we are with
Mulligan	ORGANIZATION	at
Lexington	LOCATION	and
Sherman	ORGANIZATION	at
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		The curious brogue which is placed upon the lips of the former of these officers must appear very surprising to those who knew him for the highly-educated and polished gentleman that he was ; tbis slip on the author 's part evidently comes from the hasty infer - ence that because
Mulligan	PERSON	was an Irishman his speech must have been that which is traditional upon the comic stage .

		We can not quite reconcile ourselves to the moral weakness of the hero in his relations with women ; this seems entirely out of keeping with his character as otherwise set before us , and is not artistically justified .

		But the book is a good one , on the whole , and illustrates anew the fact that the novelists of our younger genera - tion not only know the Civil War as history , bat feel it in its '' whirlwind '' character , and also , we might add , in its character as a refining fire .

Lippitt Marvin	PERSON	's '' The American Merchant Marine '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Both follow , at a short in - terval , a work closely akin to them , Mr.
W. W. Bates	PERSON	's scholarly volume on `` American Navigation , '' the three attesting the revival of interest in oar national merchant shipping due to international expansion of commerce and heightened by the pur - chase of foreign vessels by American capital and the attempt to pass the Subsidy bill for which Sen - ator
Hanna	PERSON	is sponsor in the Federal legislature .

		Of the two books before us , the first is the work of one who has given years of attention to the general subject of our ships and ship companies , and has already produced several books dealing with the subject .

		This work is the more popular in treatment of the two , written with a freer hand and with less minuteness of detail , and illustrated with many ex - cellent drawings by Mr.
Ray Brown	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Marvin	PERSON	has been somewhat more technical and maeh more explicit , his work being the more copious , although 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, the books are of practically similar dimensions .

		Mr.
Marvin	PERSON	is more concerned , also , with the earlier his - tory of our merchant shipping , following the tale through the colonial days , and coming to substantial agreement with Mr.
Edgar Stanton Maclay	PERSON	in regard to the importance of the services rendered the Amer - ican cause by privateers during our two wars with
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Both books are of so nearly the same subject-matter , no single topic of importance escap - ing either , that a description of one will serve as a description of both , with the slight differences already noted .

		But neither , strangely enough , deals adequately with the hideous treatment accorded American common sailors to-day on sea-going vessels under the American flag , a factor of no slight importance in the general decay attending all American shipping except on the great lakes , where trades unionism has been successful in ame - liorating many abuses still common on the salt seas .

		No chapter in either book is more interesting than that discussing the commerce of the great lakes , and the inland rivers also provide interesting reading .

		Both books can be cheerfully recommended .

Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- a careful and sym - pathetic , though somewhat plodding and occasion - ally rambling , piece of work .

		The abundance of quotation and allusion comes dangerously near being over-abundance and thus obscuring , rather than illustrating , the author 's points .

		The first - named of this immortal trio he regards as unri - valled for '' purity of passion '' ; the second excels in '' mastery of range '' and '' spiritual depth of imagination , '' as distinguished from its playful buoyancy ; while the third he styles '' the
Meis	PERSON	- sonier of literary art and the fair mistress of its subtlest intricacies , '' and especially extols her '' easy flow and tempered finesse . ''

		His placing of
Jane Austen	PERSON	last , '' as a dessert after the more solid courses which have preceded , '' is not so surprising when one hears his reasons .

		She was , he says , '' content with picturing the life she saw ; we search for the philosophy which will explain it ... We have reserved
Miss Austen	PERSON	, then , that in studying her works , with the more modern ' notes ' of her successors still ringing in our ears , we may more clearly understand the great differences between that time and this , and find therein their partial explanation . ''

		A few minor matters in the book provoke critical comment .

		Reference is made to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's loneliness and unworldliness as chiefly responsible for the lack of wit in her novels .

		Humor rather than wit would seem to be the right word here .

		Why , one queries , does the author speak , as he does more than once , of male and female gender when he means sex ?

		Referring to a certain degenerate class of fiction , he instances '' d'Abruzzio '' as typical of the school , presumably meaning d'Annunzio .

		When some fifteen or twenty years The reign of ^ ^ jugji ^
McCarthy	PERSON	's `` His - tory of Our Own limes appeared , the public welcomed it warmly as a distinct acquisi - tion in general popular history , while even from a technical point of view it was considered a really valuable contribution to the knowledge of the day .

		Indeed from the first , the popularity of the book was assured .

		The wit of the author , his ability in characterization , his simple directness in statement , were elements in a style of writing which was at - tractive and quite his own .

		The very partisanship with which the book was written gave it an added interest as marking the personal attitude of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	and his political faction .

		At various times since the publication of this earlier work , ad - ditional volumes from Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's workshop have appeared , none of them up to the grade of '' The History of Our Own Times . ''

		The latest of these , `` The Reign of Queen Anne '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is as conspicuously deficient in marks of genuine merit as most of its predecessors .

		And yet , having ven - tured upon a period rich in interest , and lacking in modern comment , it is indeed a pity that Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's discrimination in selection could not be followed by real ability in execution .

		Either the author underrates the qualifications of a writer of history , or he labors under the delusion that striking characterizations and witty descriptions dropper se from his pen .

		The story of the period is told with a dull directness , clear enough in statement , but never entertaining , and utterly devoid of that power of characterization which Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	certainly pos - sesses .

		As a study , the work is even more conspic - uously a failure .

		No statement is possible of the sources investigated , for none are cited , but in so far as the text is evidence , these are limited to the observations and writings of Swift ,
Burnet	LOCATION	, and
Defoe	PERSON	.

		There is no indication that the author even knows of the existence of the new sources of infor - mation upon the relations of Harley with Queen
Anne	PERSON	,
Marlborough	LOCATION	,
Defoe	PERSON	, and others , published at intervals within the last few years by the
British Historical Manuscripts Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		A history of the reign of Queen Anne which does not make large use of this new material is in fact an absurdity .

		This fault might be forgiven in Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	, who is after all no historian , if he had furnished us with a readable narrative , or even with a bright bit of special pleading .

		Lacking these , the present work is much below his own standard , and in it Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	is first of all unjust to himself . ''

		That a state may be well consti - tuted , ethical principles should form the base and groundwork of its Constitution . ''

		This quotation seems to express the purpose of a somewhat extended thesis by Mr.
Frederick Wood	PERSON	, entitled '' Government and the State '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author devotes three hun - dred pages to an a priori discussion of '' elemen - tary principles and their practical application , '' The Philosophy of Govemvient .

		The author agrees with the leading political econo - mists that the sanction for the existence of the

''

		The book will be welcomed by the general reader , who will enjoy connoting it with the obserrations of Blantschli and Willoaghby , whose works it will supplement but not displace .

		It will entertain students , but it would be more serviceable to them if the propositions of the text , which are stated concisely and without citations of authority , were accompanied by references to some of th `` leading text - writers who have previously supported the same views .

		It is in rare cases only that the thesis names other authorities .

		This may be due to the fact that Mr.
Wood	PERSON	, who was a law - yer of
New York City	LOCATION	, died while the book was in preas .

		One may regret that an editor was not engaged , to annotate the author 's manuscript and supply the references which students would have found so usefoL It is extremely difficult to take a '''' * '' TJato ** '' ** comprehensive view of
Italy	LOCATION	and the Italians , because of the great dif - ferences of life , habits , character , and -LRB- to some extent -RRB- language , in the various portions of the Italian Peninsula .

		There are .

		in the first place , a Northern , a Southern , and a
Central Italy	LOCATION	, to be taken into separate consideration .

		There are dif - ferent styles and manners in architecture , painting , and sculpture , each centring upon a separate lo - cality .

		These local differences -- more marked in
Italy	LOCATION	than in any other European country -- are andonbtedly
United Italy	LOCATION	's inheritance from Di -
Tided Italy	LOCATION	, and they will be gradually modified as time goes on and as the Italians become accus - tomed to their new political conditions .

		But at the present time , to produce a picture of
Italy	LOCATION	and Italians that would be alike comprehensive and intelligible would be no easy matter .

		We would have said that such a picture was impossible , were it not that
Signor Lnigi Villari	PERSON	, in his ■ ■ Italian Life in Town and Country '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , succeeds in presenting it .

		The author 's observations have been widely extended and are remarkably acute .

		He knows his
Italy	LOCATION	well .

		He neglects nothing that may serve to illustrate any important phase of Italian character ; nor does he regard any phase of life unimportant that might be of interest to those who want to know the country and people whereof he writes .

		He treats of the political , / kuMrya/JTajte .

		religious , military , and agricultural life of the Ital - ians , and of the government and the civil service ; he exhibits the social and home-life of the people of various classes , -- aristocrats , people of wealth , artisans , and peasants , -- and introduces his readers to the popular sports of the different localities , without any slighting of literature , mosie , or art .

		Altogether the book is a valuable addition to the series of '' Our European Neighbors '' to which it belongs .

		It is a pleasure to find a book like Mr.
Untersteiner	PERSON	's '' Short History of Music '' -LRB-
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- adding to the merits of conciseness and clearness the virtue of not being dolL The author has shaken the necessary dry leaves of fact from the tree of knowledge , but for the most part has seen to it that they fell upon a good green carpet of interesting comment .

		The book gives a conaeentiTe story of music unblurred by trivialitiea of iMOg - raphy .

		The name of each musician is made to shine by the light of his contribution to music , rather than by the number of his wives and chil - dren .

		The critical comments show not only intelli - gence , but imaginative insight .

		For example : '' If in
Palestrina	LOCATION	we find represented the divine ele - ment which humbles itself to humanity , in
Bach	LOCATION	there dominates a human element which , liberating itself from terrestrial fetters and cares , rises to heaven , confides there its sorrows , its griefs , and its anguish , finding comfort and peace after the struggle . ''

		And again : ''
Haydn	PERSON	's motiTes seem to come of neeeesity from the instruments , and we are interested in the manner of treatment by the composer .

		Mozart , on the other hand , makes themes speak his language ; his motives are more expressive , and foreshadow Beethoven . ''

		Nor does the author forget , in hia ngard for unity , how broad and deep his thene is .

		He treats music not as an invention , but as a development .

		The influ - ence of race , religion , and history on music is touched upon -- lightly , to be snre , bat with precision .

		As a book of reference the little volume would have been improved by an index , but the arrange - ment is so clear as to mitigate this fault M -LRB- we annoying to the general reader are occasional fanlts of style , which it would seem the translator might have done more than he has to correct .

		In `` The Lost Art of Reading '' artK ^ ; . ' '' '

		-LRB- P '' ' '' * '' '' -RRB- Mr.
Gerald Stanley Lee	PERSON	brings together a number of his magazine essays , all bearing upon the general proposition that the spirit of to-day is '' The Man for the Book ; not the Book , nor indeed any Thing else , for the Man . ''

		Whether or not we are all so oppressed by the weight of contemporary publica - tion as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	, or so confident of the ability of our collegiate engines to grind out machine-made men to their order , there is still enough truth in his contention , and far and away enough charm in his method of address to win and hold attention .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	does not make a programme for the re - discovery of the art of reading , further than to explain what obstacles are in the way , and to insist that reading will continue to be a lost art until living ceases to be a lost art and , losing our fear of egotism , we resolve once more to be natural .

		He is , in short , a very Emersonian individualist , but he has a way of saying the Emersonian thing over in an entirely original way , -- which is of course the Emersonian way of saying it .

		Remembering Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's other book , `` The Shadow Christ , '' we would suggest that '' The Lost Art of Reading '' is too long to be always Mr.
Lee	PERSON	at his best .

		But that is not to say that once begun it does not insist on being read through to the end , particularly if one happens to belong to any of the three classes which Mr.
Lee	PERSON	finds particularly hostile to the spirit of true reading -- the college professor , the modern - ized librarian , and the professional critic .

		A woman -RCB- g political gossip in letters .

		To anyone with a passion for the minutiae of English diplomatic his - tory , the '' Letters of Princess Lieven '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- written from
London	LOCATION	to her brother at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	during the years 1812-34 , and now collected by Mr.
Lionel G. Robinson	PERSON	in a stout octavo of 400 closely printed pages , will not seem tiresome .

		The editor thinks that at no time have personal feelings and private interests played so important a part in political history as during the period in question .

		Hence the considerable influence that the Princess
Lieven	PERSON	, wife of the Rus - sian embassador , was able to exert upon English politics , foreign and domestic .

		Her salon was as great a centre of political activity as was
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	, or the salon of Lady
Hertford	LOCATION	, or that of
Lady Jersey	LOCATION	.

		For the best effect her letters should probably be read in the original French .

		Their alternations of exaltation and depression would thus appear less akin to the hysterical , their adula - tion of her emperor less extravagantly fulsome .

		Next to poetry what can suffer more from transla - tion than the airy trifles of intimate correspond - ence ?

		This is no reflection upon the present trans - lator , who has done his difficult part admirably , so far as one can judge without comparing the two texts .

		The princess had no taste for books , but was keenly alive to people and events , and she wrote with much of that sprightliness and fluency that properly belong to the letter-writing sex .

Sidney Colvin	PERSON	has written , and
Graham Balfour	PERSON	, and now
Stevenson	PERSON	's two step - children , Mrs.
Isobel Strong	PERSON	and Mr.
Lloyd Os	PERSON	- bourne , have collaborated in a volume of '' Memories of
Vailima	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mrs. Strong reproduces the familiar talk of the little circle from jottings made in
1892	DATE	and
1893	DATE	, and writes charmingly of her Samoan proteg6 , and of the Samoan songs that were made about ''
Tusitala	LOCATION	'' and his family by the men who loved him .

		Mr.
Osbourne	PERSON	's chapter upon
Stevenson	PERSON	's home-life at
Vailima	LOCATION	describes the building of the house and the patriarchal regulation of its curious manage .

		Besides these four essays , the volume contains a hitherto unpublished poem written by
Stevenson	PERSON	in
1872	DATE	.

		Although the book tells us nothing that will be absolutely new to those who have read the
Vailima	LOCATION	letters and the biog - raphy , its odds and ends of reminiscence have the charm that belongs to all Stevensoniana .

		With its many illustrations made from photographs by the authors , this volume will be prized by all lovers of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's unique personality .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		It includes selectious , in approved English translations , from a score of authors , all the way from Homer to Luoian .

Stanley McCormick Uopi Expedition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another recent publi - cation of the Museum is a monograph on the '' Flora of the Island of
St. Croix	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.

University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author does not claim to have made a positive identification , but , after discussing the problem raised by the familiar entry in

1903	DATE	comes to us from the

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's distinction as a man of letters , a student of politics , and a man of affairs has enabled him to pi-ofit to the full by the opportunities afforded through his long friendship with
Bismarck	PERSON	.

		For many years he knew the Iron Chancellor and visited him and enjoyed his confidences .

		The Bismarck literature which has been published in
Germany	LOCATION	has necessarily been subjected to much revision and editorship for political reasons .

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	understood the policy , motives , and views of
Bismarck	LOCATION	as explained by himself , and his book affords a significant and intimate interpretation of the great statesman of a wholly personal character .

		There is history that is held in respect , but neglected , and history that is read .

		Whitman 's '' Personal Reminiscences of Prince Bismarck '' represents the intimate history which holds the attention and is eagerly read .

		BRIEFER MENTION 125 NOTES 126 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 126 LEGISLATIOX FOE THE SCHOOLS OF CHICA GO .

		Once in two years the Legislatare of
Illinois	LOCATION	holds its stated session , and as often as this biennial event recnrs , a resolute endeavor is made by the friends of public education to secure a new school law in place of the anti- quated legislation that has held a place in the statute-book for many years .

		The existing law is hopelessly inadequate because it reflects only the educational demands of a full generation ago , and because it makes no special provision for the needs of a g ^ at city system like that of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Upon two past occasions we have chronicled the attempt to introduce system and efficiency by legislative enactment into the schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and in both cases the final entry of the record has been one of failure .

		The comprehensive measures proposed by Mayor
Harrison	PERSON	's
Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	and by the Civic Federation of
Chicago	LOCATION	were both defeated by the customary appeals to pre - judice and selflsh interest , and two successive Legislatures have shown themselves incapable of rising to a great occasion and responding to an educational demand that expresses the best modem thought upon this supremely important subject .

		At the present time , a third attempt is being made to secure for
the State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, and especially for the City of
Chicago	LOCATION	, a suitable statutory basis for the system of the public schools .

		The
Civic Federation	ORGANIZATION	has presented to the Legislature a revised form of its meas - ure of two years ago , and the
Chicago Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	has offered a measure of its own , less comprehensive , but not essentially different u far as the two measures cover the same ground .

		In one respect , the situation is ma - terially changed from what it was when the earlier attempts of this sort were made .

		During the past two or three years , the school author - ities of
Chicago	LOCATION	have , of their own initiative , put into operation many of the ideas for which educational reformers have been working of late , and the result has been a strengthening and quickening of the whole city system .

		This result , which would have been remarkable in any case , seems still more remarkable when we note that it has been accomplished in the face of revenue conditions of the most depress - ing sort .

		In spite of the utterly inadequate income of the last two years , the schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	have been in a healthier condition than ever before in their recent history , which fact oflFers a gratifying tribute to the wisdom of their management A high standard of requirement in teaching ability has been en - forced , political and personal influence in appointments has been minimized , many for - tunate economies have been practiced together with those which , though unfortunate , could not be avoided , and the educational force has been given permanency of tenure subject to 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, good behavior .

		This is only an outline of what has been accomplished ; the whole story would require many pages for its setting forth , and will constitute , when it comes to be told in detail , one of the most interesting chapters in the history of our city educational systems .

		The essential aim of the measures now pend - ing in the
Illinois Legislature	LOCATION	is to give the force of law to the reforms that have already thus approved themselves in practice .

		One might suppose that such a demand would only have to be made to be granted , but the forces of prejudice and selfish interest are , as usual , arrayed against it , and the outcome is more likely than not to be failure once more .

		An ag - gressive prejudice always has an undue effect upon legislative opinion , and one active oppo - nent of a proposed law has more influence upon its fortunes than a score of passive advocates .

		The present opposition seems to depend upon two main lines of argument .

		One of these is the utterly meaningless plea that the pro- posed measures violate the principle of home rule by transferring control of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools to the government of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is meaningless because , as every well-informed person knows , all authority in educational mat - ters rests with the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and the only school law that
Chicago	LOCATION	can have must be a law of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		The fact that so disingenuous an argument as this can be used at all shows to what straits the partisans of the old order are reduced .

		The other ground of opposition is found in the purpose of the proposed legislation to invest the executive head of the school sys - tem with enlarged powers and responsibilities .

		This objection may possibly amount to some - thing , although the measures now under dis - cussion do no more than confirm a practice that has been found to work admirably for some time past .

		No doubt there can be such a thing as too great a concentration of power in the hands of a superintendent , and any plan hav - ing this end in view must be judged , not in the light of its workings at any given time , but in the light of its extreme possibilities under other conditions .

		A law which would produce excellent results when administered by a wise and tactful officer might conceivably produce very bad results when administered by an un - balanced and capricious executive .

		But the methods and the language employed to voice this view in the present instance are not of a nature to inspire confidence in the objectors , and a careful examination of the measures un - der debate seems to show that sufficient safe - guards against unjust and arbitrary action are provided .

		If not , these safeguards may easily be strengthened without impairing the essen - tial character of the proposed legislation .

		With possibly a few slight modifications , we believe that the passage of either of the meas - ures now so hotly debated would be for the best interests of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools .

		And yet the advance which the enactment of such legisla - tion would mark would by no means justify the friends of educational progress in resting on their oars and considering their work accom - plished .

		A thoroughly satisfactory school law must go beyond what is now being attempted , and make the profession of teaching one which shall be comparable with the other professions in attractiveness .

		The aims of the legislation now under debate are essentially three in num - ber : expert control by responsible officers hav - ing a definite legal status , the merit system in appointment and promotion , and permanency of tenure after the necessary time of probation .

		So far , so good , but there are three other things that should also be secured .

		The teacher 's tenure of office must be safeguarded not merely by doing away with the form of annual reelections , but by an emphatic statu - tory declaration that nothing but professional inefficiency or personal immorality shall consti - tute a valid cause for dismissal .

		Until this prin - ciple is given the force of law , school authorities in one place or another will be found making marriage , or non-residence , or some other mat - ter utterly irrelevant to educational efficiency , a sufficient ground for dismissal , and just as long as these petty interferences with personal freedom are possible the best men and women will shun the profession and its whole standard will be lowered .

		The second thing to be se - cured by an adequate school law is a minimum scale of salaries , and a provision for guaran - teeing their payment irrespective of fluctuations in the revenue .

		In this matter ,
the State of New York	ORGANIZATION	has done worthy pioneer work , and its statute upon this subject might well be taken as a model for other commonwealths .

		The third requirement of an ideal school law must be a provision for pensions after a quarter - century or more of service .

		Such provision for the old age of the public teacher is to be regarded not as a charity but as a right -- as a part of his just compensation for a life of de - votion to the public good .

		We could wish , indeed , that the three purposes above specified might have been made a part of the legislation now proposed , but the fact that they are not
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		Ill included hardly affords a sufficient reason for rejecting the measures , in the main so admir - able , that are now before the
Legislature of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		We trust that this body will prove wiser than its predecessors , and earn for itself the gratitude of all friends of educational pro- gress , by giving us a law that in some degree shall reflect the opinion of to-day upon the question of public education .

		FOE 'S PLACE AS A CRITIC .

		In the world 's literature there are only two absolutely great critics -- Aristotle and
Lessing	PERSON	.

		The '' Poetics '' of the one and the '' LaocoOa '' and '' Dramaturgerie '' of the other are the fountains at which all secondary critics must fill their pitchers .

		Aristotle is limited in certain directions by a lack of material to work upon ; and , similarly ,
Lessing	PERSON	is circumscribed by dealing too exclusively with Latin and French authors .

		But they have the genius of divination , and their work is final .

		Amongst the ancients ,
Longinas	PERSON	was an inspired appreciator .

		He felt so fully the greatness and charm of literature that he communicates a like thrill and fervor to his readers .

		He is exalting and stimulating to the last degree .

		But except a few oracular utterances about style , and some dry re - marks on grammatical forms , he gives us no infor - mation as to the underlying principles of art .

		English literature can boast of a long succession of critics only inferior to the great Greek and Ger - man -- giant planets to that double sun .


Dryden	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, -- these and others have left us a body of criticism more varied and weighty than any other modern nation , save
Germany	LOCATION	, possesses .

		Does
Poe	PERSON	de - serve to rank with these men ?

		Poe unquestionably performed one of the most diflBcnlt feats of criticism .

		With almost unerring instinct , he separated the wheat from the chaff of his contemporary literature .

		Hawthorne ,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, and others , received from him some of their earliest and most valuable ap - preciation .

		If he erred , it was on the side of enthusiasm .

		His position was analogous to that of an expert in precious stones , who can pick out by instinct the real and perfect gems from a mass of flawed stones or paste imitations .

		But such an expert is not necessarily a practised mineralogist or chemist , acquainted with the composition of minerals and capable of reproducing them in the laboratory .

		And the literature which
Poe	PERSON	practised upon is certainly not of the first importance .

		His few casual utterances about really great books are wrong .

		His attempts to postulate principles of poetry are ludicrously wrong .

		It is unpleasant to have to act as Devil 's
Advo	ORGANIZATION	- cate toward a writer whom one loves and reveres , -- but the truth is best .

		Poe 's psendo-poetic principles have had a great influence , and one decidedly de - trimental to the development of the best and great - est in literature .

		It is worth while , therefore , to examine some of them .

		One of his most elaborate , and , in a way , bril - liant , articles is that on '' The Rationale of Verse . ''

		It is logically argued , and if its premise were sound it would be a valuable little treatise on versification .

		Bat it is vitiated by the assumption that English verse is founded on quantity .

		Poe 's master ,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , knew better , and when he was casting around for a method of formalizing verse he bit upon the metre of ''
Christabel	PERSON	. ''

		This is simply accentuation systematized .

		-- the four beats or points of em - phasis in each line answering the purpose of a suc - cession of quantitative feet .

		It would be a hard thing to say that there is no quantity in English poetry , -- but it certainly does not perform the office that
Poe	PERSON	imagined it did .

		I doubt whether any great En - glish poet ever thought of quantity when writing his lines , or , save in exceptional cases , scanned them after they were written .

		It is only by the most forced construction and conventional application of the rules of prosody that the ordinary iambic line -- the most natural to our language -- can be made to scan -- '' Lad ; I you are -LCB- the crS | Slist she | alive . ''

		There is a typical line of blank verse , and unless I am greatly mistaken it is composed of four spondees , with an anapest , -- truly a curious iambic measure .

		But even when you have got an approxi - mation to your iambic line -LRB- it is trochaic really -RRB- '' Not in I lone splSn \ dor hung - | aloft | the
n %	PERCENT	ht , '' you can alter every quantity and the line will run just as well , -- e. g. -LRB- my amendment of course not being intended to make sense -RRB- .

		See there | dim bean | ty gleam | ing on -LCB- the sky .

		Poe was a great lyric metrist , but the beauty of his verse is largely due to his marvellous caprices and daring feats of accentuation .

		Scanned by a master of Latin prosody , his verse would look queer indeed .

		In justice to
Poe	PERSON	, I would say that if the quanti - tative system is untenable the theory of accented and unaccented syllables disposed in feet after the classic fashion is equally so .

		There are lines , mainly monosyllabic , where every syllable is accented , which would give ten feet to a line of heroic verse .

		And there are other lines where polysyllables are crowded so closely together that there are only four , three , or may be two accents in the verse .

		This last statement may be doubted , so I will give an example , and it is easier to make than to find one : Euripides , the Eleusinian .

		Here the is certainly not accented and the other two words have the normal accent on the antepenulti - mate and no others that I can detect .

		The ac - cents are fixed in the metre of ''
Christabel	PERSON	, '' but in no other English metre known to me .

		Poe 's most famous critical dictum is the one which asserts that in the nature of things there can 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, be no long poem , -- that a work of poetic art , to prodace the proper effect , mast be capable of being read at a single sitting .

		There is a delightful un - certainty about this .

		What is a long poem ?

		and how many minutes or hours may a sitting last ?

		There is nothing in the world to prevent one from reading '' Paradise Lost '' at a sitting , if one wants to ; and the '' Iliad '' is a baby among epics com - pared with the ''
Shah Namah	PERSON	. ''

		But
Poe	PERSON	evidently intended to set up as his standard of the short poem , the ballad or lyric .

		There would be a slight measure of truth in his assertion , if the whole effect of a work of literary art were confined to the first instantaneous , momentary shock , -- if we were then to forget the piece and never read it again .

		But a poem worth reading at all is worth reading many times , and our minds are not so feeble that we can - not carry the impression on from time to time .

		In reading a long poem , our pleasure is , in great part , cumulative ; we can look before and after , and de - tect those leit-motifs -- to borrow a phrase from a sister art -- which consolidate the work together .

		No one questions the unity of impression produced by a long novel -- ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' for instance , -- though nobody may read it at a single sitting : why , then , should we doubt that a poem or a play may be as much or more concentrate .

		Bat the mere statement of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's theory is an exhibition of its absurdity .

		It rules out of art all the great poetic creators , -- Homer , .

		^ schylus ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, -- and leaves the field to the lyrists and ballad-mon - gers .

		The common-sense of mankind would reject such a preposterous conclusion , were it backed by an authority ten times as potent as
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's .

		And the greatest authority of all ,
Aristotle	LOCATION	, specifically de - manded '' a certain magnitude '' as a condition of greatness in a work of literature .

		The lilt of the thrush and the blossoming of the rose have their place in nature , -- but so have the mighty foldings of the mountains , and the wheelings , cycle upon cycle , of planets and suns .

		If
Poe	PERSON	had merely as - serted that the ordinary average human intellect is only capable of assimilating brief impressions of greatness or beauty , he would have been right enough .

		Bat that is the fault of the ordinary average intellect ; and it has nothing to do with the comparative greatness or value of works of art .

		Again and again
Poe	PERSON	asserted that beauty was the sole province and object of poetry .

		It is true that he sometimes qualified his axiom by admitting that a certain strangeness was a necessary ingre - dient of beauty .

		But he could not or did not rec - ognize that the deities who preside over poetry are twin , -- one female .

		Beauty , -- the other , male .

		Power ,
Greatness	ORGANIZATION	, Sublimity .

		It is carious that his own work is lacking in just the quality he deemed all-important -- beauty .

		Even in diction , his phrase has seldom the perfect grace and haunt - ing charm and massy weight which are almost habitual with
Keats	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, and of which
Wordsworth	PERSON	and Arnold and
Emerson	PERSON	have such frequent use .

		The lines '' To
Helen	PERSON	, '' '' The Haunted Palace , '' some phrases from '' Isra - fel , '' and this , from '' To One in Paradise , '' -- '' No more , no more , no more Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree .

		Or the stricken eagle soar , '' -- are almost all that occur to me of weight and magnificence in his expression .

		He got his effects by wholes rather than details , and by music rather than phrase .

		When it comes to the matter of
Poe	PERSON	's work , -- his conception and design , whether in prose or verse , -- beauty is conspicuous by its total absence .

		What beauty , in any sane use of the word , can there be in the horrors and glooms , the Rembrandt-like chiaro-oscuro , of the confined charnel-houses , or vast illimitable spaces which
Poe	PERSON	's imagination created and peopled ?

		But there is immense sublimity .

		Poe is the most sublime poet since
Milton	PERSON	.

		Sublimity stirs even in his most grotesque and fanciful sketch , -- like
Milton	PERSON	's lion '' pawing to get free his hinder parts . ''

		It rears full-fronted in the concluding pages of '' The Narrative of
A. Gordon Pym	PERSON	, '' -- in the sentences which describe the enormous balk and battle - lanterns of the ever-living ship in '' The
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		Found in a Bottle . ''

		It is predominant in the mighty sweep , the ordered disorder , of ' < The De - scent into the Maelstrom . ''

		It thrills us in the many-colored chambers of '' The Masque of the Red Death . ''

		It overwhelms us with horror in '' The Murders of the Rue Morgue . ''

		It is solemn and awe-inspiring in ''
Berenice	PERSON	, '' '' Legeia , '' and '' The Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	, '' -- in '' Ulalame '' and `` The Raven . ''

		Metaphysic , which Poe de - rided , -- the great problems of life , death , and the universe , wherein sublimity most resides , -- haunted his mind continuously .

		He reaches his climax of almost too profound thought in the colloquy of ''
Monas	PERSON	and Una , '' '' The Power of Words , '' and '' Eureka . ''

		No poet has so continu - ously tried to outreach the possibilities of human experience ; none has so assiduously avoided the ordinary facts of human life .

		His sublimity ac - counts for his fate with the American public .

		A true democracy , it abhors greatness and ridicules sublimity .

		Yet
Poe	PERSON	fascinates it with antipathic attraction .

		It follows him very much as
Sancho Panza	PERSON	flounders after
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		In spite of its sublimity ,
Poe	PERSON	's theatre of tragic abstractions is of coarse inferior to the flesh-and - blood theatre of the gfreat creators .

		They include him , -- they are as high as he , and they have many times his breadth and weight .

		But he is very great even in his one-sidedness -- his silhou - ettedness .

		One-sidedness may indeed make an artist more intense and effective .

		Bat it is a crime in a critic .

		Despite bis fine instinct for what was good ,
Poe	PERSON	had not the breadth of view or the knowledge necessary for a great critic .

		It is better that a critic should err in judgment in a concrete case than that he should lay down princi - ples which are provably wrong .

		THE DIAL 118 C ^ t ich -RRB- goohs .

		IiiTBRART Essays of a Naturalist .

		* Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	has given us no more delightful revelation of himself than in the volume of eighteen essays which he names , from the opening chapter , '' Literary Values . ''

		Many of the essays , perhaps all , have seen the light in magazines ; but their appearance in book form is none the less welcome .

		It has been said of a certain living author that he has the best style in literature to-day because one can read page after page of his writing without being conscious of reading at all ; it is pure expression , offering no resistance .

		These words of praise , as quoted by Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	himself , apply to his own literary style .

		It is the best possible style , because it is the man .

		In one of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's letters , written in later life , he says he has ceased to care much for books , except books about books .

		Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- roughs , as the years go by , finds in himself a contrary inclination .

		Books about real life in - terest him far more than works that are the result merely of the friction of the mind upon other literature .

		And who will not agree with him ?

		Nevertheless he writes as engagingly about '' Mere Literature '' as about the robin and the squirrel and the honey-bee ; and the more we read the more the wonder grows that a man who has accomplished so much in nature-study has found time to read so widely and to digest so thoroughly what he has read .

		The reviewer is tempted , in the enthusiasm of the moment , to make his notice of this volume consist wholly of ample quotations ; but that would be an injury to those having the reading of the book still in prospect .

		So he refrains from skimming the cream , lest the process should empty the milk-pan .

		A few matters only , out of so much that is suggestive , may be touched upon , either for the sake of hearty commendation or of mild dissent .

		Literary criticism the author classes with creative literature .

		Its value as a guide to the reader he regards as subordinate to the intel - lectual and emotional pleasure and stimulus it affords . ''

		Reduce criticism to a science , '' he says , '' or eliminate the element of impression - ism , and the result is no longer literature .

		The reason may be convinced , but the emotions are untouched . '

		The `` personal equation '' he • LiTKBABT Values , and
Other Papers	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John Bur	PERSON	- ronghs .

		Boeton :
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		looks upon as the vital element in work of this sort .

		Hence , he adds , '' the secret of the greater interest we take in signed criticism over unsigned . ''

		In another chapter , however , one notes with approval the warning given by the sharp-eyed , truth-loving nature-student against '' that literary cast of mind that prefers a picturesque statement to the exact fact . ''

		We find the personal element in Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's con - fident assertion that the swallow passes the winter in the mud , '' conglobulated into a ball '' ; but the untruth of such writing spoils it even as literature .

		In the chapter on '' Style and the Man , '' Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	finds much of the secret of a good style in the elimination of friction ; which recalls Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's '' economy of at - tention , '' both friction and attention having reference , of course , to the reading , not to the writing .

		Let the author speak for himself : * ' How little friction the mind encounters in
Addison	LOCATION	, in Lamb , or in the best of our own prose writers ; and how much in
Meredith	LOCATION	, and the later writings of
Henry James !	ORGANIZATION

		Is not friction to be got rid of as far as possible in all departments of life ?

		One does not want his shoes to pinch , nor his coat to bind , neither does he want to waste any strength on involved sentences or on cryptic language .

		Did you ever try to row a boat in water in which lay a sodden fleece of newly fallen snow ?

		I find the reading of certain books like that .

		Some of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's poems impede my mind in that way . ''

		On another page he says the obscurities and affectations of certain recent English poets and novelists are sure to drag them down , and that
Browning	PERSON	, '' with his sudden leaps and stops , and all that Italian rubbish , is fearfully handicapped . ''

		Yet it must be added that other passages in the book seem to mark Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	a lover of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Quoting Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's advice to cultivate a variety of styles in writing , the author protests that such a course would produce a Jack-of-all-styles and master of none , and maintains that one specific style should be practiced .

		Now , however true that a conscious aiming at variety too often produces an unpleasing patchwork , yet the master can and does vary his style with his theme .

		The Dickens of '' The Pickwick Pa - pers '' is not exactly the
Dickens	PERSON	of '' A Child 's History of
England	LOCATION	, '' nor the latter the
Dickens	PERSON	of `` American Notes . ''

		How many journalists , too , write acceptably in different styles for different papers .

		Probably the author 's real objection is to the mixing of styles in the same article or book ; for he himself well says in summing up the whole matter : `` Id treating of nature or outdoor themes , let the 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, style have limpidness , sweetness , freshness ; in criticism let it have dignity , lucidity , penetration ; in history let it have mass , sweep , comprehension ; in all things let it have vitality , sincerity , genuineness . ''

		Among the chapters on subjects not strictly literary , those on
Gilbert White	PERSON	and Thoreau deserve especial mention -- if one may make distinctions where all is excellent .

		It is inter - esting to contrast with this breezy little sketch by a naturalist on ''
Thoreau	PERSON	's Wildness '' the highly wrought essay on Thoreau by the book - man
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		To the latter
Thoreau	PERSON	was .

		one of the '' pistillate plants kindled to fruitage by the Emersonian pollen , '' and the whole paper is full of pretty conceits and bookish allusions , containing much more of
Lowell	PERSON	and his library than of
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		But not thus are we teased and tantalized by Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	; he goes straight to the mark .

		Again in the last two chapters , '' The Spell of the Past '' and '' The Secret of Happiness , '' he breaks away from literature and leaves the reader undecided whether the author is more delightful when discoursing on life and the world of the senses , or when treating of books and the world of the imagination .

		Whatever his subject , the naturalist peeps forth in word or metaphor here and there ; and this self-betrayal is as pleasing in its pic - turesque results as it is inevitable .

		For in - stance , writing of Whitman , he says that '' he elaborates the least and gives us in profusion the buds and germs of poetry . ''

		Sainte-Beuve is styled '' not a profound or original mind , but a wonderfully flexible , tolerant , sympathetic , engaging one ; a climbing plant , one might say , that needed some support to display itself to the best advantage . ''

		Poetry is '' a breeze touched with a wild perfume from field and wood . ''

		In regard to a man 's literary likings , '' something as subtle and vital and hard to analyze as the flavor of a fruit , and analogous to it , makes him prefer this poet to that . ''

		Of the styles of two diflferent writers , '' in the one case the sentences are artificial ; in the other they bud and sprout out of the man himself as naturally as the plants and trees out of the soil . ''

		Shakespeare '' has been the host of more literary parasites probably than any other name in history . ''

		The stylist , we read , '' cultivates words as a florist cultivates flow - ers . ''

		So one might go on with instances of the botanical and horticultural flavor that per - vades the book , but nowhere to excess .

		One expression , however , this time drawn from mathematics , is less pleasing .

		It is '' personal equation , '' and it occurs repeatedly .

		An equa - tion is the expression of equality between two terms , and why the bias of a man 's mind should be called an equation is a puzzle .

		The usage is as common as it is indefensible , but Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's employment of the term is the more striking because his genius is so far mathematical that we find him , in this very book , capable of the following : '' We may com - plete a circle from a small segment of it .

		If we have two sides of a triangle , we may add the third .

		To find the value of an unknown quantity , we must have a complete equation and as many equations as we have unknown quantities . ''

		It is a small matter , but one re - grets to see a writer whose language charms by its vitality and apt significance , adopt a conventional term that is worse than mean - ingless .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Scottish
Gow	PERSON	^ rie Mystery .

		* In attempting to unravel theGowrie Mystery and the
Treason of Logan of Restalrig	ORGANIZATION	, Mr ,
Lang	PERSON	is clearly conscious that he is undertak - ing tasks which would try the talents of Sher - lock
Holmes	PERSON	and Mr.
Allen Pinkerton	PERSON	, for he makes appreciative allusions to these distin - guished detectives .

		It is a long and fascinat - ing chase on which the reader is asked to accompany the author ; more than once our steed balks at critical stumps as well as at shadowy conjectures .

		It is the student of myth and legend and the potential novelist , rather than the historical philosopher , whom we are following .

		But who is not charmed by a mys - tery ?

		And who will not gladly spend an even - ing pursuing one to its source , especially if it is a dark and desperate Scotch mystery ?

		On the 5th of
August , 1600	DATE	,
John	PERSON	,
Earl of Gowrie	PERSON	, and his brother ,
Alexander Ruthven	PERSON	, were slain in the house of the former ,
Gowrie House	ORGANIZATION	in
Perth	LOCATION	, by certain nobles in the suite of
King James VI	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		The king and his party claimed that this was done to defend the king from a murder attempted by
Ruthven	PERSON	.

		The kinsmen of the
Ruthvens	PERSON	, and the
Kirk	PERSON	in general , maintained that it was murder by the king 's command , either as the result of a brawl or of deliberate plan .

		THE DIAL 115 fact that the testimony at the official hearing was almost all corroborative of the king 's ac - count ; on the other hand is the fact that it was given under torture , and that '' his Maj - esty 's word was not to be relied on . ''

		After the introduction of much new and important evidence and very acute sifting of the old , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	arrives at the conclusion that the king 's account is in the main true , but that
Gowrie	PERSON	and
Ruthven	PERSON	intended only to capture , not to murder , their victim .

		He is not led to this conclusion by '' any sentiment for that un - sentimental Prince , ' gentle King .

		Jamie , ' for he was not the man to tell the truth ' if he could think of anything better , ' '' but by the balancing of probabilities .

		It is interesting to note that this conclusion is essentially the same as that of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	in his ' ■ Tales of a Grandfather . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's arguments are in brief as fol - lows : The king had no reason for wishing to put the brothers out of the way , the only mo - tive suggested , jealousy of Queen
Anne and Gowrie	PERSON	, being without plausible evidence .

		And even if he had reasons , he would not have re - sorted to so uncertain and crude a method of accomplishing his end .

		Moreover , the king 's story of the affair , though hard to believe , is consistent with the accounts of all the other witnesses , and was maintained by him unaltered through much hostile cross-questioning on the part of ministers of the Kirk .

		Finally , the the - ory of a conspiracy against the king is supported by the -LRB- recently discovered -RRB- letters of
Logan	LOCATION	of Restalrig .

		On the other hand ,
Gowrie	PERSON	may have laid the execution of his father to
James	PERSON	, and he may have had other grievances ; again , he may have been influenced by
Francis Bothwell	PERSON	and others to wish to hold and control the king for political reasons , -- an experiment that had been made more than once before with
James	PERSON	and his mother ,
Mary Stuart	PERSON	.

		The reasons that are urged against the probability of
Gowrie	PERSON	's undertaking to murder the king do not hold against an attempt of this latter sort .

		Finally , the case for the Ruthvens is greatly weakened by the contemporary Vindication of the
Ruth	PERSON	- vens , a document recently discovered by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		This Vindication , presumably the best that could be made while the sources of infor - mation were still fresh and open , is shown to be * ' conspicuously mendacious . '' ''

		The value of the Apology is to show how very poor a case was the best that the vindicator of the
Ruthvens	PERSON	was able to produce . '

		One piece of evidence , to which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	attaches some value , he has not examined with the same critical eyes that have looked through the mazes of the contemporary testimony .

		This is the coat-of-arms devised by the
Earl of Gowrie	ORGANIZATION	while a student at
Padua	LOCATION	, which is honored by reproduction in colors as front - ispiece to the volume under consideration .

		The supposed signifieanoe of this coat-of-arms lies in the addition to the family design of a mailed knight pointing at a crown and utter - ing the motto ''
Tibi Soli	PERSON	. ''

		This is interpreted as conclusive evidence of designs upon the government on the part of
Gowrie	PERSON	; the knight , representing
Gowrie	PERSON	, being supposed to say '' For thee alone '' to himself and with appli - cation to the crown .

		But aside from the post factx > rumors that
Gowrie	PERSON	had such ambitions , is not the first and most natural interpretation of that motto , as the hand , or sword , points at the crown , '' I serve thee alone , '' that is , the
King	PERSON	, whom the crown represents ?

		At least , this interpretation is not so improbable that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is warranted in exclaiming , '' What other sense can the emblem bear ? ''

		that is , what other sense than , '' The crown is for thee alone . ''

		In fact , would not this sense be better expressed by ''
Mihi Soli	PERSON	'' ?

		In
1608	DATE	one Sprot , a notary , was arrested on the charge of treasonable foreknowledge of the
Gowrie	PERSON	plot and confessed the same under torture , admitting that he had possessed letters from
Logan	LOCATION	of Restalrig to
Gowrie	PERSON	and others confirming the theory of the plot against the king and involving
Logan	LOCATION	in the plot .

		These letters were found on
Sprot	ORGANIZATION	's person when he was arrested .

		Later in his trial he declared that the letters were forgeries .

		Still later he declared that there had , however , been one genuine letter from
Logan	LOCATION	, from which he quoted .

		None of the letters were introduced for examination in the trial , but on
Sprot	ORGANIZATION	's confession of guilt he was executed .

		Logan bad taken the precaution to die two years earlier ; but government , following a pretty custom of the olden time , had his body ex - humed and condemned and his children for - feited of their estates .

		At this posthnmons trial the letters were put in evidence ,
Sprot	LOCATION	's declaration that they were forgeries being suppressed . ''

		Sprot , under examination , lied often , lied variously , and , perhaps , lied to the last '' : hence without the letters
Logan	LOCATION	could scarcely have been found guilty .

		With the assistance of various experts Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has examined these letters , still preserved in the
General Register House	ORGANIZATION	at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, 116 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, and concludes that they are all forgeries as to the writing , but that one of them , the most important and detailed of all , the one addressed to
Gowrie	PERSON	, bears internal evidence of being genuine .

		The others , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	concludes very plausibly , were constructed upon this as a basis .

		But it must be conceded that the evidence aside from that of the perjurer Sprot against
Logan	LOCATION	as author of an original letter , is very slender .

		In substance , it is , that the character revealed in the letter fits in with what we know of
Logan	LOCATION	, while it is quite too real a revelation of character to have been invented by the scribbler Sprot .

		Yet , aside from this letter , there is no direct evidence whatever connecting
Logan	LOCATION	with the
Gowrie	PERSON	plot .

		He does not seem to have been under suspicion at the time .

		Only the fact of his selling all his property soon after the
Gowrie	PERSON	affair , and later leaving the country , seems to show that he had a bad conscience and felt himself to be in danger .

		Slender as this evidence is , and frankly as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	admits its inconclusiveness , we are inclined to agree with him that the probability is strongly for
Logan	LOCATION	's authorship of an original letter to
Gowrie	PERSON	, which Sprot may have copied .

		It is curious that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	should hold -LRB- p. 238 -RRB- to the possibility of the letter being in
Logan	LOCATION	's hand . ''

		It may be a Sprot after
Logan	LOCATION	. ''

		The facsimiles of
Logan	LOCATION	's hand - writing , of Sprot 's , and of the forged letter , show clearly enough that the forged letter is not in
Logan	LOCATION	's hand .

		It has peculiarities , no - tably the abbreviation for '' and , '' which are not found at all in the genuine
Logan	LOCATION	writing , and , indeed , but scantly , and not quite identi - cal in shape , in the genuine Sprot writing .

		The forged letter may be in
Sprot	LOCATION	's hand ; it is certainly not in
Logan	LOCATION	's .

		The case stands thus : If we accept the es - sential authenticity of the
Logan	LOCATION	letter -LRB- `` No .

		IV . '' -RRB-

		, then the
Gowrie	PERSON	plot against King
James	PERSON	-LRB- not to kill , but to capture him -RRB- is proved beyond any doubt ; but if we reject the
Logan	LOCATION	letter as a baseless forgery , still the remaining evidence is strongly for the plot on the part of the Gowries against the king .

		Here , as in the author 's ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	and the Casket Letters , '' we have to do with by - products of his '' History of
Scotland	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet there is a charm in being admitted to the art - ist 's workshop and taken into his confidence , -- in discussing with him , as it were , the pros and CO/18 of his final decisions .

		Perhaps this famil - iarity renders the historian 's utterances some - what less authoritative for us ; but it certainly increases our respect for his honesty and sm - cerity .

		Garrulity is to be expected under the circumstances , and of much repetition we are forewarned by the author .

		A few Gallicisms may be charged off against the many debts we owe Mr.
Lang	PERSON	. ''

		To give upon '' -LRB- of a door -RRB- is a favorite phrase of his ; but '' to have nothing to make with , '' -LRB- i. e. have nothing to do with -RRB- , is carrying us too far out upon the Channel .

		Photogravure portraits of
King James	LOCATION	and Queen
Anne	PERSON	, together with the colored plate of the

		FrrxY Years of the
American Stage	ORGANIZATION	.

		* An autobiography of the oldest living me - tropolitan actor , relating in modest and ex - pressive language numerous incidents and events that have had no small part in the for - mation of our American drama , is an invaluable acquisition to theatrical literature .

		Mr.
James H. Stoddart	PERSON	has been identified with the American stage for upwards of fifty years , appearing first in
New York	LOCATION	,
September 7 , 1854	DATE	, at
Wallack	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre .

		During the long period there has been scarcely an actor or actress of note with whom he has not been associated , and of whom he has not some an - ecdote to relate with droll humor , in his care - fully written '' Recollections of the American Stage . ''

		It is interesting to note that , at a time of life when the average man , in a simple spirit of submission , looks upon life 's work as ended , Mr.
Stoddart	PERSON	's indomitable energy -- frequently a characteristic of Scotch ancestry -- still keeps awake his interest in the '' tinselled life '' of the stage , and his charming personal - ity aids him in extracting a caltn philosophical pleasure from the very shams and follies against which in his early days he had so stoutly battled .

		To understand fully the ca - reer of any person who has exerted a marked influence upon his times , it is necessary to understand the circumstances and conditions which have made his career and influence pos - sible .

		His parents were theatrical people , and at five years of age he made his first ap - pearance on the stage as
Martin Haywood	PERSON	in
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	's drama of '' The Rent Day , ' '' and for years afterwards he wandered with his parents through the small English towns , en - countering the ups and downs of life -- `` being far oftener down than up . ''

		He recalls many peculiar incidents of those early days in En - gland and
Scotland	LOCATION	, during which time it was his good fortune to play with
Macready	PERSON	,
Helen Faucit	PERSON	,
Charlotte Cnshman	LOCATION	.


Kean	PERSON	,
Charles Mathews	PERSON	, and other celebrities .

		In
August , 1864	DATE	, he reached
America	LOCATION	, and the following month joined the company of
James W. Wallack	PERSON	at the munificent salary of
fifteen dollars	MONEY	a week .

		Quite naturally , he in time became associated with all the favorites of '' the old school '' of actors .

		He looks upon
Edwin Booth	PERSON	as the most gentle , unassuming , unostentatious man he ever met .

		Comparing the early days with the new order of things , Mr.
Stoddart	PERSON	says : '' The attention given to production is now so infi - nitely more careful and thorough than in the old dars as to admit of no comparison .

		The same old stock scenery , formerly used year after year , would be looked upon as a very poor apology for the manner in which plays are now put upon the stage .

		The same advance - ment applies to incidental music , and in fact to all the details connected with the conduct of the theatre .

		To those , however , entering the theatrical profession with the idea of making it their life work , I say that I think the old system immeasurably better than that of the present time .

		As in all occupations it is well to be grounded in the rudimental portions of the work , so no less does this rule apply to the theatrical profession .

		There was no royal road to position in the old days , but most people bad to commence at the bottom of the ladder and ascend it gradually , the goal being its top .

		And if one never climbed very high , yet the very strife & nd endeavor of itself gave to him that repose , that ease of deportment , which I think quite essential in the actor .

		Such discipline was formerly deemed neces - sary , and if , after submitting to it , one was not found particularly brilliant , one was at least experienced , which means much . ''

		Mr.
Stoddart	PERSON	reviews at length the many parts he has played in successful metropolitan pro- ductions , -- parts that have gained for him a most enviable position in the theatrical world , both as a man and as an artist .

		The volume is happily illustrated with many old portraits and reproductions of rare old play-bills .

		In a prefatory note by Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, the venerable critic sums up the ac - tor 's career in the following words : `` Greatness in dramatic art , meaning the summit of excellence in interpretative expression , is simplicity , and of simplicity Mr.
Stoddart	PERSON	possesses the absolute command , tonehiog equally the springs of homor and pathos , winning affection as well as admiraUon and thus fulfilling the best purpose of all art , which is to bless human life with the gracious memory that makes it calm and the noble incentive that makes it beautifuL ''

		In con - sidering Mr.
C. J. Holmes	PERSON	's elaborate critical study of `` Constable and his Influence on LandscapePainting , `` no more will be attempted than the giving of such impressions as stand oat most sharply distinct from among the many received from the work .

		A book about an artist and his work must be addressed to those who read about art rather than to those who produce it , -- that is , to those whose interest in art is chiefly intellectual , and who do not concern themselves primarily with how the thing is done .

		It seems neces - sary , then , first to place the individual and the art in question so that they may be viewed in their true perspective ; for it is the first re - quirement of the mind that what is offered for its consideration should be presented in the scale and proportion that belong to it as the part of a scheme or growth , rather than as something detached and specific , and deriving only from itself .

		Individual gift and environment have no doubt a larger share in determining what a landscape painter does , than is the case with other painters ; yet even here , and with a gen - ius so profoundly original as the one in ques - tion , to consider the individual as though he were entirely responsible for himself would be to give but a poor account of him .

		So , before showing what
John Constable	PERSON	's art owes to
John Constable	PERSON	, Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	shows what it owes to those who , before him , had tried in this way to give out their consciousness of earth and sky .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, vigorous flowering in the less genial English air , must he regarded as a singularly valuable contribution to the literature of art .

		He points out the essentially subsidiary and decorative purpose with which
Raphael	PERSON	,
Da Vinci	PERSON	,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest of their great company , painted trees and fields and skies .

		Considering the art organically , and as a development , while yet allowing for temperament , environment , and all else in the individual that has varied the type , he follows it through
Rubens	PERSON	's fluent and masterly conventions , through the silvery distances of
Claude	PERSON	, through
Poussin	LOCATION	,
Cuyp	ORGANIZATION	,
Holbein	PERSON	, and
Ruysdael	PERSON	, down to the time when , no longer a tradition more or less well seasoned with some salt of personal sentiment , no more a servant to some artistic purpose other than its own , it at last found in Nature itself a com - plete reason .

		As the writer 's purpose concerns the artist rather than the man , but little is told us re - garding Constable 's personal history .

		Enough is given , however , to impart a certain pleasant warmth to our interest in his art , which is placed against a lightly-sketched background of common human affections , of hopes and fears , joys and griefs , like unto our own .

		Looking at these beautiful photogravure repro - ductions of his paintings -LRB- there are seventy - seven of them -RRB- , we should no doubt get very near to the heart of this artist ; for there is a peculiar fulness of self-revelation in a great painter 's work , which is one measure of his greatness .

		With no other record of him than these pictures , we could read his story very well , in many of its essential phases .

		It would seem that this artist did not find himself very early , not developing even a definiteness of purpose until he was twenty-six years old , while it was at least fifteen years more before he had acquired anything that could properly be called a style .

		He was never , in fact , an accomplished brushman , and worked out all of his larger and more seriously designed can - vases through laborious processes that included many artistic devices besides that of the direct brush-stroke .

		He himself , in one of his letters , attributes his lack of popularity to the fact that he had '' no handling , '' meaning that his brush-work was not fluent , and that he achieved his effects by the employment of other than direct brush handiwork .

		It is not possible here to follow the evolution of Constable 's art from its beginning to its splendid maturity .

		It varied so greatly , both in manner and in excellence , not only in differ - ent periods but in the same period , that the writer himself does not attempt to review Con - stable 's work as a direct chain of sequences , though he makes perfectly clear its essential characteristics when considered as a whole .

		These may be briefly indicated .

		Constable was the first real Nature painter , -- the first , that is , who ever painted earth and sky with the single purpose of reproducing the actual sensation of their forms , their color , and their light .

		Others , like
Raphael	PERSON	and
Da Vinci	PERSON	, had painted these things as though not seeing them , making symbols and counters of them , mere servants to their artistic schemes .

		Titian , though he shows that he had looked at the mystery of twilight with his soul in his eyes , did not try to report the appearance of it , but used what he saw only as he could make it serve his other purpose .

		Even Rubens , with his splendidly facile way of putting down what he saw , and
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, and the lesser Dutchmen with all their natural disposition to paint '' things as they are , '' never seemed to think that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	deserved to be considered purely for herself , and with a mind and eye frankly open to her own color and light .

		It seems strange that an Englishman should be the first to find in the less seductive environment of his bleaker clime the full inspiration for a great landscape art , -- for great it was , with all its narrowness of scope , its lack of subtlety in color , its indirection of labored craftsmanship ; strange past divining , that Southern skies and tints had not persuaded to their single service some of the great ones who looked upon them .

		Yet so it was ; and cold mist-swept skies , and valleys and fields that smile not over-brightly , won to themselves the full devotion that fairer and more inviting prospects had bidden for in vain .

		So
England	LOCATION	established for all time the first pure landscape tradition , -- for
Turner	PERSON	, his great contemporary , was rather a painter of dreams , and clothed earthly things with such richness of unearthly fancy that his pictures were '' golden visions , '' as Constable called them , rather than transcripts of Nature .

		And here we come to one of the two great lim - itations in Constable 's art .

		Neither in purpose nor effect was it largely creative .

		His desire seemed too much to paint the trees and the fields and the skies that he looked at '' as they are . ''

		He loved them surpassingly ; and this very greatness of his love betrayed his art a little , causing his pictures , except in a very few instances , to lack that fine concentration of effect that landscape art only achieves when
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 the actual appearances of its subject are mod - ified in the direction of an intellectual purpose .

		This purpose must derive from something sug - gest `` d by the scene itself , or the picture will be too imaginative , too fancy free , and will not waken our own nature consciousness ; but the purpose must be there , and must be felt , before a work can have that higher interest that attaches to a `` human document . ''

		We must find , also , that his work lacked that ex - pertness in the `` handling '' of his medium that is found in the work of all the great masters of painting , and except in some of his sketches , makes them appear too indirectly done ; while his drawing is often open to exception .

		It is greatly to belittle the discoverer , though , -- whether it be a new world or some new field of painting that he has found , -- to measure his accomplishment on the scale of its immediate importance .

		Had this been done , we should have had neither a World 's
Colum	PERSON	- bian Exposition nor this beautiful book .

		It is not to be questioned -- nor does Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	question it -- that later painters have produced landscapes which , viewed either as the embodi - ment of human thought and feeling , or as nat - ural effect , are much better works of art than any done by
John Constable	PERSON	.

		Yet we must remember that it was his mind that first enter - tained this '' new thought '' of Nature as being meet , just in herself , for art 's whole service ; and his hand that first found good painter 's terms for this new thought .

		In emphasizing this fact , however , the author of the book does not permit us to lose sight of such incomplete - ness in the art as has been suggested .

		His treatment of the subject is never that of the blind hero-worshipper , but keeps everywhere that critical balance that makes art - writing com - mend itself to sober minds .

		Yet if , in looking at some of these beautiful reproductions , we are borne momentlv from our own critical moorings , and hunger for some words that will fit our frame of mind , we find them here , -- choice , discrim - inating , but having a flavor about them as though the critic also had felt like letting him - self go .

		A very delightful feature of the book , and very illuminating of its subject too , is the con - siderable number of excerpts from Constable 's letters and lectures before the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		These show intellectual qualities of a high or - der , combining wit and humor with evidence of the keenest appreciation of his art and of earnest well-considered purpose in it .

		In a lett `` r to his friend
Leslie	PERSON	, he states this pur - pose thus : '' My art flatters nobody by imi - tation , it courts nobody by smoothness , it tickles nobody by petiteness , it is without either fol-de-rol or fiddle-de-dee . ''

		Again he writes : '' Every thing seems full of blossom of some kind , and every step I take ... that sublime expression of the Scriptures , ' I am the resurrection and the life , ' seems as if uttered near me . ''

		And again : `` The land > scape painter must walk the fields with an humble mind ; no arrogant man was ever per - mitted to see Nature in all her beauty . ''

		In these three extracts is a full confession of faith , a whole artistic creed .

		As Constable was slow in maturing his own art , so has the world been slow in acknowl - edging his claims .

		He had not , like
Turner	PERSON	, a great writer to recommend him to his time ; and it is only of late that his high merits have been widely allowed , or that the words in which Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	sums them up would find general assent .

		This is his verdict : '' The most sin - cere , consistent , intelligent , and sympathetic worshipper of natural beauty as revealed in English pastoral scenery , who has ever lived . ''

		It may be that Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	presses the notion of Constable 's direct influence a little too far .

		He does it cautiously and tentatively , it is true ; but to suggest , even as a possibility , that
Corot	LOCATION	, for instance , could have assimilated to his ideally different sentiment and practice any - thing from the three pictures of Constable that were shown in
Paris	LOCATION	in
1824	DATE	, is to make more of the Englishman 's influence than seems con - sistent with a full appreciation of the other '' rti8t .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, of it has already appeared elsewhere , and has become part of the make-up of the American mind .

		Mr.
Riis	PERSON	does not propose to work alone .

		His cry is not , '' See what a fine thing I am doing ! ''

		but '' See what is being done , and can be done , and come and take a hand ! ''

		It is the democratic ideal , that everyone can help , from President Koosevelt , whose portrait appears opposite the title-page , to the ignorant immi - grant who arrived yesterday .

		And for that mat - ter , `` our poor human nature is at least as robust on Avenue A as up on
Fifth Avenue	LOCATION	, if it has half a chance , and often enough with no chance at all '' -LRB- p. 220 -RRB- .

		The human species is ex - tremely variable , and the most progressive peo - ples exhibit most variation .

		Hence it happens that all men are not born equal ; do not come into the world with the same endowments .

		Is this fact to be a stumbling-block to democracy ?

		Not at all ; it is the one thing which makes a genuine democracy possible .

		Because each one preserves his own individuality , stands for something more or less unique , it is possible to have a national architecture , as it were , in which no part is useless , no part independent of the rest .

		Each may attain a certain supe - riority ; each may willingly acknowledge many kinds of inferiority ; none may cease to strive upward .

		Mr.
Riis	PERSON	does not claim to be a sociologist , but the logical outcome of his work is to enable every individual to take his proper place in the world 's work , -- indeed , in the world 's play also .

		This , at all events , is the '' inalienable right '' of each member of a de - mocracy , and the no less inalienable need of that democracy itself .

		Two or three things are plain to every reader of `` The Battle with the Slum . ''

		One is , that the people of the slums do not have anything like a fair chance ; another , that they are capable of much improvement , given better conditions ; a third , that it does not do to wait on philanthropy for justice .

		These things are generally known , in a vague way ; but Mr.
Riis	PERSON	makes them living realities .

		It is a favorite opinion of some people that the unfortunate and downtrodden are such because they are not ca - pable of anything else .

		There is necessarily a certain element of truth in this ; but from the time that the Israelites came out of
Egypt	LOCATION	, history has afforded instances enough of the regeneration or new birth of peoples who had been supposed incapable of anything noble .

		This country is the '' promised land '' of hordes of workers from over-sea , and we may believe with Mr.
Riis	PERSON	that there are possibilities here of welding this miscellaneous and at first sight unpromising material into the structure of a great nation .

		This is not to be done , however , without strenuous effort , and the '' battle '' has been real enough .

		Mr.
Riis	PERSON	thus speaks of the results , contrasting past with present : '' Human life then counted for less than the land - lord 's profits ; to-day it is weighed in the scale against them .

		Property still has a powerful pull . '

		Vested rights ' rise up and confront you , and no matter how loudly you may protest that no man has a right to kill his neighbor , they are still there .

		No one will contra - dict you , but they wo n't yield -- till you make them .

		In a hundred ways you are made to feel that vested rights are sacred , if human life is not .

		But the glory is that you can make them yield .

		You could n't then . ''

		It may be that Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's style is rambling , and his sentences are occasionally obscure ; it may be that he is not always quite fair to things he does not understand ; but his book is a live book , full of human interest , and is the record of great things done .

		It will help to make things move , and that is what it was written for .

		Mr.
Cooley	PERSON	's '' Human Nature and the So - cial Order '' is in many ways a remarkable book .

		The present writer , as he read it , found much to admire ; and yet the impression produced by the whole was unfavorable .

		Having said this , he feels that he owes some explanation , al - most an apology .

		The argument throughout is closely reiasoned , and it is hard to say exactly why it does not appear satisfactory .

		At the very beginning , the author boldly announces : '' A separate individual is an abstraction unknown to experience , s > nd so likewise is society when regarded as something apart from individuals .

		The real thing is Human Life , which may be considered either in an individual aspect or a social , that is to say , general , aspect ; but is always , as a matter of fact , both indi - vidual and general '' -LRB- p. 1 -RRB- .

		Again : '' The main thing here is to bring out the vital unity of every phase of personal life , from the simplest in - terchange of a friendly word to the polity of nations or of hierarchies .

		The common idea of the matter is crudely mechanical -- that there are persons as there are bricks , and societies as there are walls .

		A person , or some trait of personality or of intercourse , is held to be the element of society , and the latter is formed by the aggregation of these elements .

		Now there is no such thing as an element of society in the sense that a brick is the element of a wall ; this is a mechanical con - ception quite inapplicable to vital phenomena .

		I should say that living wholes have aspects but not elements '' -LRB- p. 134 -RRB- .

		As regards the self , it is by no means to be identified with the material body ; it is rather a body of feeling , or ideas , which may be much
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 more closely identified with so-called external objects than with the parts of the individaal 's anatomy .

		Says Mr.
Cooley	PERSON	: '' There is do view of the self , that will bear examin - atioD , which makes it alto ^ ther distinct , in onr minds , from other persons .

		If it includes the whole mind , then of course , it includes all the persons we think of , all the society which lives in our thoughts .

		If we con - fine it to a certain part of our thought with which we connect a distinctive emotion or sentiment called self - feeling , as I prefer to do , it still includes the persons with whom we feel most identified .

		Self and other do not exist as mutually exclusive social facts , and phraseol - ogy which implies that they do , like the antithesis egoism versus altruism , is open to the objection of Tagueness , if not of falsity '' -LRB- pp. 91-92 -RRB- .

		Each individnal constructs a self-platform , the planks of which must fit together more or less harmoniously : and the sense of wrong is felt when anything is added which is inhar - monious .

		Thus , if a man regards himself as honest , be dislikes to do a dishonest thing , be - cause it breaks into and injures the self-idea .

		This self - platform , necessarily based largely on impressions received from others , is always re - lated to the society in which we move , and no one can think of himself except in relation to others .

		Even when the individual is isolated , physically and socially , he tends to create a mental society of ideal beings with whom he seems to hold intercourse .

		The present writer would be the last to deny the intimate connection between the individu - als of any society of living beings ; indeed , when one regards the complex social organ - ization of such animals as the Zoophytes , it be - comes difficult to say exactly what are the limits of personality in a physical sense .

		Or again , is a tree a single individual or a multitude of individuals ?

		-- the answer is not so simple as it looks .

		Yet , nevertheless , he is quite pos - itive that he is a distinct entity , much more distinct than a brick in a wall .

		When Mr.
Cooley	PERSON	says that such a proposition will not bear examination , he means simply that no ob - jective proof can be found for it ; which , of course , is in the nature of the case .

		He may fairly urge , however , that my subjective con - sciousness recognizes only myself , and thus includes therein the universe , so far as it is known to me .

		If the universe is myself , there - fore I am the universe , and not a distinct and separate thing at all .

		--
Q. E. D.	PERSON	To this it must be replied that a point exists in space , and by virtue of space , and yet is a thing of itself .

		If only one point existed , it would be identical with all space ; but we can not con - ceive of space that is not extended , that is , many-pointed .

		So I affirm my totally distinct being , because I feel absolutely certain that there are other such beings , other points in the spiritual universe .

		Thus out of the fact of '' other '' comes the fact of '' self , '' not as an '' aspect '' but as a veritable '' element . ''

		To fully discuss Mr.
Cooley	PERSON	's book is impossible in a short review .

		It is full of interesting ideas , but we could wish that it were less wordy and more illuminated by concrete examples .

		Mr.
W. J. Ghent	PERSON	, in `` Our Benevolent Feudalism , '' presents us with a picture of modern society which recalls the occasions when one has seen one 's reflection in a door - knob .

		The reflection was grotesque in the extreme , but unmistakably represented one 's physiognomy .

		Mr.
Ghent	PERSON	writes in a lucid and interesting manner , and arrives , in gen - eral , at these conclusions : < ■ What , then , in this republic of the
United States	LOCATION	, may Socialist , Individualist , and Conservative see alike , if only they will look with unclouded vision ?

		In brie * , an irresistible movement -- now almost at its culmi - nation -- - toward great combinations in specific trade * ; next toward eaaleMeaee of kindred industries , and thus toward the eompleta integration of capital .

		Consequent upon these changes , the group of captains and lieu - tenants of industry attains a daily increasing power , social , industrial and political , and becomes the ranking order in a vast series of gradations .

		The state becomes stronger in its relation to the propertyless citizen , weaker in its relation to the man of capital .

		A growing subordination of classes , and a tremendous increase in the numbers of the lower orders , follow .

		... In a word , they who desire to live -- whether farmers , worit - men , middlemen , teachers , or ministers -- must make their peace with those who have the disposition of the livings .

		The result is a renascent Feudalism , which , though it differs in many forms from that of the time of
Edward I.	PERSON	, is yet based upon the same status of lord , agent and underling .

		It is a Feudalism somewhat graced by a sense of ethics and somewhat restrained by a fear of democracy . ''

		I sometimes have said that I am a socialist , and yet believe in the divine right of kings .

		I do not believe that a perfectly organized democratic society will be without leaders ; on the contrary , it will assiduously search out those who excel in any particular , and make full use of their talents .

		As a matter of fact , the com - monwealth of science is to-day organized on a perfectly international and democratic basis ; everyone who cares may have his say , and leadership exists at the same time , without com - pulsion .

		Authority is recognized too much rather than too little .

		I do not think , there - fore , that we have any reason for identifying mastership with tyranny ; the one is natural and desirable , the other an abomination .

		122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, At the same time , of course Mr.
Ghent	PERSON	is right in pointing out the vast amount of un - natural mastership or tyranny which exists in modern society .

		As a means of stirring peo - ple up to appreciate the real dangers of the situation , the book will do excellent service .

		The situation , as it seems to me , is this : In - dustry is rapidly becoming organized on a cooperative basis , so far as production is con - cerned , and the time is at hand when the people must choose whether to be slaves or free .

		If the people are not fit to participate in an in - dustrial democracy , they can not , though all the capitalists should be drowned in the sea .

		Whenever and in such degree as they are fit , the country and the fulness thereof is theirs .

		It may justly be urged that as a matter of fact the people have not the chance to become fit .

		It is conceivable , of course , that they might be hindered in this to such a degree that no genuinely democratic government would ever become possible ; but this I can not believe .

		At the same time , it is impossible to exaggerate the need for help in this matter , help which must largely take the form of education , of one sort or another .

		It is just for this reason that such men as Mr.
Eiis	PERSON	are so invaluable .

		The problem is in a way a psychological one .

		The existing unfitness is mental rather than phy - sical .

		As I see it , one of the greatest difficulties in the way is the intense desire of the people to get something for nothing : to receive the unearned increment .

		It would seem as if they looked forward to the time , predicted by some facetious fellow , when all would live on the in - terest of accumulated capital !

		A comprehensive survey of the phe - nomena involved in all that leads up to laughter and all that issues from it has not as yet been at - tempted in English ; Mr.
Sully	PERSON	's volume on the sub - ject -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is accordingly timely , and , like all his writings , attractive .

		The scope of the topic is indeed a broad one , beginning with the place of laughter in the physiological economy and ending with a disquisition upon its philosophic justification and mStier ; while the intermediate considerations include a careful discussion of the genesis of laugh - ter , its appearance in the eras of childhood , its simulation or approximations in the animal life , its characterization among the less developed races of mankind , the differentiations of its object matter , and its various social , sssthetic , and intellectual ramifications . ''

		In looking for the germs of laugh - ter we found ourselves in the wide and misty plains of biological speculation .

		In tracing its develop - ment we took a dip into the pleasant vales of child - psychology and anthropology , and then tried to climb the winding paths of social evolution .

		Hav - ing reached in this way the heights of modern civilization , we made a special investigation into the social organization of laughter , essentially indi - vidual and independent of the social standard , to which is given the name of humor .

		Throughout this voyage of discovery we have kept in view the question of the function of the laughing spirit in the life of the individual and of the community . ''

		The prospective reader may be assured that Mr.
Sally	PERSON	's guidance through this varied region is most capable and suggestive .

		It brings home a profound sense of the unity and of the inter-relations of those expressions of the eternally human in which the true '' humanities '' have a common and mutually illuminating interest .

		It is no small tribute to the attainments of a philosophical writer in these days to have become the expounder of two such opposite tendencies as Pessimism and the Philosophy of Laughter , and to have imparted to both an unusual interest of exposition as well as philosophic grasp and literary expertness .

Browne	PERSON	's sehtdarship , but a more unreadable book was never written than this companion volume to Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	's ``
Ireland	LOCATION	'' and Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's `` America . ''

		- y ^ ^ .

		.

		-LRB-
Qxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- represents the painstaking and careful work of an able historical scholar , fortunate in the possession of much new material on an interesdng period of history .

		When this is understood , there remains bat little to say of the work itself ; for it is wholly impossible , in a brief notice , to cite the various episodes and events upon which the author easts new light or alters previous historical impressions .

		No general authoritative history of the Peninsular War has been produced since
Napier	PERSON	's famous work .

		In the sixty years that have elapsed siaee that work appeared , many valuable memoirs have been written , and many sources of information have been opened , or discovered , which were not within
Napier	PERSON	's reach .

		Mr.
Oman	PERSON	has made himself the master of these sources , and has analyzed and used them with a scholar 's care .

		His work , therefore , is authoritative and modern , and as such most sup - plant
Napier	PERSON	's where facts are in question .

		If this new and trustworthy material were attractively arranged and presented , the '' History of the Pen - insular War '' would take higher rank than it can possibly do under the circamstanees .

		for Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's careless writing forbids it a place among really great works of history .

		It would be unjust to the author to decry his book by means of a com - parison with the more readable qualities of
Napier	ORGANIZATION	, for Mr.
Oman	PERSON	has admitted his limitations as a narrator , and has distinctly acknowledged his in - ability to comp > ete with the earlier writer .

		It may also be offered as an excuse for dryness , that the necessarily minute technical details of military history are incapable of illuminating treatment .

		Yet , though recognizing this , every reader most feel a keen sense of disappointment that in nar - rating events not necessarily technical , or that in characterizing important personages of his study , Mr.
Oman	PERSON	has used a seemingly careless familiarity of language , wholly unsuited either to his theme , or , very evidently , to his own abilities as a writer .

		Worst of all , it is apparently % forced earelesaoess , -- one is almost tempted to call it a striring after e # fect by intended crudity of statement , -- and , aa such , is the more impardonable .

		Still , this offense against good taste is much more marked in the opening chapters than in later ones , and the book as a whole steadily improves in style throughout its six hundred pages .

		It is at least a very welcome , and a wholly trustworthy , piece of modem histor - ical investigation .


South Africa	LOCATION	is a land of extremes .

		Ever since the Portuguese landings and explorations of the fifteenth century , this country has had a fascination for ad * venturers .

		Portuguese , Dutch , and English hare successively searched for its hidden riches .

		Deserts , famines , and savage native tribes conld not turn them back .

		Over veldt , river , and mountain , they pushed their way into the interior .

		Mr.
Gardner F. Williams	PERSON	, in `` The Diamond Mines of
South Africa	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , tells how the greatest dia - mond mine of the world was discovered , developed , and made the sourtse of uncounted wealth .

		A child picked up a shining pebble for a plaything from the gravel on the edge of a river ; and that pebble , proving to be a diamond , led to the discovery of the great diamond fields of
Sooth Africa	LOCATION	.

		This volume discusses the original voyages to that land , the hardships which the pioneers endured , the progress made in its settlement , and the growth of other settlements almost down to the present time .

		The mimatf a-tk
Africa	LOCATION	.

		124 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, An enthuHtutic Bostonian ^ t book on
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The bulk of the work covers the years from
1871	DATE	down to the present -- the period of diamond mining .

		We get a vivid picture of the growth of methods of mining , from the original shaking of sieves on the surface to the underground shaft - mining of to-day .

		Such a marvellous revolution in thirty years certainly bespeaks the genius and the enterprise of the Englishmen and Americans en - gaged in the work .

		The reader 's conception of the author 's narrative is clarified and defined by 493 illustrations in the text , 28 photogravures , and 12 maps .

		An appendix , on the siege of
Kimberley	LOCATION	, gives one a good idea of that period of anxiety and distress .

		Many readers will be particularly inter - ested in the author 's estimate of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	and his plans for the development of
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Other characters prominent in
South African	LOCATION	min - ing operations also receive adequate recognition .

		This volume properly balongs to that class of liter - ature which carefully and minutely sets forth the great industrial enterprises of this vigorous age .

		It also shows that the author made use of the best information , popular and scientific , to elucidate his fascinating theme .

		One could hardly be more thor - oughly saturated with one 's theme , more ardently and enthusiastically aglow , than is the author of '' Boston Days '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	here deals es - pecially with the
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- and vicinity -RRB- of the mid - nineteenth century , '' a most remarkable period , '' she says , '' and one which is almost without parallel since the golden days of Pericles . ''

		It would be surprising not to find some extravagant assertions in a writer so carried away with her enthusiasms .

		Alcott she regards as '' far and away the greatest man of his time , '' and
Hawthorne	PERSON	as '' unquestion - ably the greatest romancist in the English tongue . ''

		Of psychic research she unhesitatingly declares that it '' may be said to have scientifically demonstrated the actual nature of life after the change we call death . ''

		While there is much to be said in praise of the spirit of the book as a whole , one can not but note its tendency to diffuseness , frequent re - petition , and errors of fact .

		The
Emerson	PERSON	gene - alogry is bungled , both
William	PERSON	and
Joseph	PERSON	being made the husbands of
Pboebe Bliss	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lowell 's mar - riage to
Maria White	ORGANIZATION	is placed in
1866	DATE	-- thirteen years after her death .

		Some puzzling phrases oc - cur .

		Good health is called '' a very rational factor in life . '' ''

		An occnltation of correspondence '' is said to have existed among the literary lights of
Emerson	LOCATION	's time .

		`` This data , '' `` nominus umbra , '' `` Echermann , '' `` Brahman '' -LRB- for
Braham	PERSON	-RRB- , and other irregularities , give unpleasing variety to
Miss Whiting	LOCATION	's pages . ''

		Inflorescence '' is worked to death .

		If the reader can overlook these and sim - ilar defects , he will find much to enjoy in
Miss Whiting	LOCATION	's entertaining pages .

		Many letters from Mrs.
Whipple	PERSON	's valuable collection are published for the first time , and the volume is rich in por - traits and facsimiles .

		That little pile of ragged mountains Id r ^ 7r known as
Switzerland	LOCATION	has produced some of the great characters of his - tory .

		The beginning of the sixteenth century found this collection of Swiss cantons in the throes of re - ligious and political reform .

		The leader of both of these movements was
Ulrich Zwingli	PERSON	.

		What Luther was to the religious upheaval in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Zwingli	PERSON	was to religion and patriotism in
Switzer	PERSON	- land .

		Mr.
Simpson	PERSON	's `` Life of Ulrich Zwingli '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a re-statement of the chief facts and events in that champion 's career .

		The story is based upon the abundant and very com - plete literature of
Zwingli	ORGANIZATION	's time and pen .

		The au - thor is an ardent admirer of his hero , and sets forth with full meed of praise his contribution to that mighty movement which arose in
Switzerland	LOCATION	against
Rome	LOCATION	, and the attempts of foreign govern - ments to allure to their own ranks the choicest blood of the country .

		The author compares Luther and
Zwingli	PERSON	, greatly to the disparagement of the former .

		Doubtless
Zwingli	PERSON	's hard common-sense and great wisdom in dealing with people made him such a natural and wise leader .

		He was an open-minded , cautious , yet rapid enough driver of his people , to do
Switzerland	LOCATION	and religious reform inestimable good .

		Mr.
Simpson	PERSON	has made this story attractive , instruc - tive , and valuable to everyone interested in the tragical past of those heroic mountaineers .

		Depth of thought , charm of style , P > y flipi '' - ' apt illustration , clearness of demon - on vital themes . '

		, ' stration , with now and then an out - cropping of his vein of quiet humor , combine to make the late Dr.
C. C. Everett	PERSON	's '' Immortality and Other Essays '' -LRB-
American Unitarian Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion -RRB- a most readable and instructive volume .

		The power to treat the abstrusest themes of religion and philosophy in a manner at once so scholarly , so clear and simple , and so convincing , is found in no other writer .

		The central thought of the opening essay is that immortality is as incapable of demon - stration to the mortal as is the full life of manhood and womanhood to the infant in its cradle .

		The second chapter , on '' The Known and the
Unknow	PERSON	- able in Religion , '' and the third , on '' Mysticism , '' discuss Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's assertion that the essence of religion is mystery , and seek to show that , while the sense of mystery is central and su - preme in religious thought and life , nevertheless God is in the known as well as in the unknown .

		The fourth paper is a memorial address on
Joseph Priestley	PERSON	.

		The next is on '' The
Faith of Science	ORGANIZATION	and the Science of Faith . ''

		The ancient Hindu theory made the earth rest on an elephant , and the elephant on a tortoise ; just as the old lady thought it rested on a rock , that rock on another , and so on , -- a succession of rocks all the way down .


John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, with equal simplicity , affirms that scientific induction rests upon induction ; in other words , that there is induction all the way down .

		Dr.
Everett	PERSON	shows the futility of all such
1903	DATE	.

		THE DIAL .

		125 grasping after demonstrable and tangible supports .

		Fandamentally , faith is as necessary to science as to religion . '

		• The Philosophy of the Sublime '' is maeh in the key of that delightfol little book , '' Poetry , Comedy , and Duty , '' from the same pen .

		The Toinme closes with ''
Spencer	PERSON	's Reconciliation of Science and Religion '' and ' • The Gain of His - tory , '' for further knowledge of which the reader must go to the book itself .

		Its contents are none the worse for having already appeared in different periodicals .

		The methods of romantic fiction ap - ' ■ hillr ^ ML ^ plied to autobiography have pro- duced a readable book in
Madame Adam	ORGANIZATION	's '' Romance of my Childhood and Youth '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which is thoroughly French from cover to cover .

		Love , of the violently demonstra - tive and hysterical sort , and ever-recurring political discussions that wander out into the wide nowhere and tumble over the edge , form the characteristic staple of the book .

		That the heroine , petted and quarreled over and fought for by grandparents , parents , and aunts , was not utterly spoiled in the rearing , fills the reader with wonder .

		Mme.
Adam	PERSON	-LRB- otherwise known as
Juliette Lamber	PERSON	-- her father was
Jean Louis Lambert	PERSON	-RRB- brings the interesting records of her precocious and somewhat turbulent early life up to the time of her first and unhappy marriage with
M. Lamessine	PERSON	, when she appears to have been about fifteen years old .

		A half - promise is held out of a second volume devoted to her literary career .

		The translation , which is an - onymous , is marred by some infelicities , and even by an occasional grammatical error .

		Although there is no historical foun - dation for the tale of Romeo and `` ^ * > K `` ry .

		Juliet , yet
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	willed it that the scene thereof should be laid in '' fair
Verona	LOCATION	. ''

		The Capnlet and
Montagu	PERSON	houses , and a fend ex - isting between them , are mentioned by
Dante	ORGANIZATION	; and the
Veronese	PERSON	point out the house of Romeo , and have erected a tomb to be exhibited to visitors as that in which the '' star cross 'd lovers '' were buried .

		In
Verona	LOCATION	,
Dante Alighieri	ORGANIZATION	found a haven in his day of adversity and exile , and the acknowledg - ment of the hospitality he received is world - renowned .

		It was in the streets of
Verona	LOCATION	that he was pointed out by women of the lower classes as the one '' who went to Hell and returned when he listed , and brought news up above of those who were there below . ''

		It was the city of the Scaligers who had a ladder for their coat-of-arms .

		It is a city with a history and with an art peculiarly its own , and with many architectural and archsologi - cal features , -- notably the amphitheatre once ca - pable of seating 20,000 persons .

		Altogether it is a desirable city to visit , and desirable to read about .

		Mrs.
Althea Weil	PERSON	tells the interesting '' Story of
Verona	LOCATION	'' in the `` Mediaeval Towns Series '' of exquisite handbooks -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- , and her story is illustrated by Miss
Nelly Erichsen	PERSON	and
Vtnma	LOCATION	, iU Miss
Helen M. James	PERSON	, and hence we have what we might call ''
Verona	LOCATION	as Seen by Three English - women . ''

		The book does not disappoint as , how - ever much we may expect of it under either title .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Lovers of ''
John Inglesaot	PERSON	'' will be pleased to know of the stately three - volume reprint of that famons novel just pat forth by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This edition has everything to commend it in the way of dignified manofacture and handsome typography , but is without illustrations , save for the frontispiece portrait of Mr.
Shorthouse	PERSON	.

		The covers of light green silk give the book a charming setting , and make it delightful to both touch and sight .

		The work of two modem French masters ,
Corot	LOCATION	and Millet , is given an admirable presentation in the special winter number of '' The Studio '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The text , edited by Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	, consists of two ex - cellent essays by French writers of authority , and some brief notes by Mr.
Frederick Keppel	PERSON	on the etchings of Millet .

		In the way of illustration , there are nearly one hundred and fifty plates , many in photogravure and colors , forming a collection that would reflect credit on a work costing several times as much as this .

		Among recent modem language texts we have from the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Al - though little more than an annotated list of names , it is a work of marked interest , and makes a dignified volume of over two hundred and fifty pages .

		Un - fortunately , the record is incomplete for certain pr '' - Revolutionary years , as there is no official source - material for the period before
1820	DATE	, and the files of current newspapers have been the sole reliance of the editor .

		This intensely interesting story of the mysterious inner doings of the mysterious realm which we know so little about deals very comprehensively and very primarily with the interesting subject .

		Mr.

		In the light of certain recent happenings , one might paraphrase the old saying of
Fletcher of Saltoun	ORGANIZATION	.

		and remark : '' I care not who make '' the tariff laws of a country , if I may make the treasury rulings . ''

		Two practices of our cus - toms service have been exploited in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' during the past month that are interesting in themselves , and more strikingly so when placed in contrast with each other .

		In general terms , it may be said that these two interpretations of the law illnstrate how tenderly , on the one hand , treasury official - dom deals with a commercial interest of any sort , and how roughly , on the other , it handles an interest that is mainly related to the intellec - tual life of the nation .

		Herrings and books are the respective sub - jects of the two practices that have just been brought to light .

		We have a duty on herrings , as a matter of course , for the protection of the
New England	LOCATION	fisherman , and for the purpose of preventing American manhood from being cheapened by an opportunity to consume cheap food .

		The
New England	LOCATION	fisherman can catch his herrings and bring them to market without any danger of competition from the Canadian product .

		But the canny
Gloucester	LOCATION	skipper knows a trick worth two of that .

		Instead of going to the trouble of catching his own her - rings , he sends his smacks to the Newfound - land shore , buys by the barrel his herrings from the Newfoundlanders who have caught them , and enters his cargo at
Gloucester	LOCATION	duty free as a product of American industry .

		The cat recently escaped from the bag when an at - tempt was made to bring a cargo of this sort into the port of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Since the herrings had obviously been caught by pauper Canadian labor , they were required to pay duty .

		An ap - peal to the treasury resulted in a stem rebuke to the over-zealous collector , who was directed to conform to '' the custom of the port of Glou - cester , '' and admit such herrings without duty as the product of American fisheries .

		Now for the quite different matter of the 140 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
March 1	DATE	'' books .

		An English publisher wrote last No - vember to Mr.
Brett	PERSON	, the president of the
Mac - millan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, describing an important work that was in preparation , and offering to sell the American firm an edition of five hundred copies at a certain price .

		The offer was accepted , and the books , with their accompanying invoice , reached
New York	LOCATION	a few weeks ago .

		Knowing something of the suspicion with which our cus - toms officials regard all importers -- especially of books , scientific instruments , and works of art , -- Mr.
Brett	PERSON	increased the invoiced valua - tion of the shipment by fifteen per cent before attempting to pay the twenty-five per cent tax which our enlightened government imposes upon all knowledge that happens to be printed in the English language .

		This seems to have been an unwise step , for it caused suspicion to darken into conviction of fraudulent intent , with the result that duties and penalties were imposed amounting in all to a sum nearly equal to the actual price of the books .

		In other words , this bit of customs jugglery ended in forcing the importer to pay a duty of ninety per cent upon a purchase which the law plainly declares shall be taxed at the rate of twenty-five per cent .

		Thus is the wisdom of protection justified of her children .

		The official pretext for this extrordinary performance is found in the claim that books must be taxed upon their market value , and that this value is fixed by the selling price in the country of publication .

		If an invoice is made out for less than two-thirds or there - abouts of the retail price so much the worse for the importer .

		He will be taxed at the higher rate anyway , and made to pay a pen - alty besides .

		It is possible that the law war - rants such an interpretation , although it is strange that its meaning should have been just discovered .

		Our present tariff law is such a tissue of indefensible provisions that an irra - tional feature more or less does not greatly matter .

		But this interpretation , if sustained , will make it practically impossible for editions of new English books to be sold to American houses .

		Such editions , as everyone knows who has any acquaintance with trade conditions , are offered at one-half or less of the retail price in the country of origin .

		This is the '' market value '' in such a case , just as the higher price is the market value in the case of the single copy sold to an individual purchaser or the dozen copies .

		taken by a bookseller .

		We presume from Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's figures that the work which is the subject of his complaint was offered him for about forty per cent of the list price in place of the sixty per cent or more which would be asked for small quantities sold to the English trade .

		This would afford a reasonable profit on the cost of production of the extra edition , because in such a case the first cost , which must determine the selling price in
England	LOCATION	, need not be taken into the reckoning .

		It is upon some such terms aa these that the publishers of either country have always been accustomed to place in the other special editions of their new publications .

		If the recent ruling be upheld , this practice must cease because the duties exacted will prove prohibitive .

		What the public fails to realize unless its attention is particularly directed to the matter , is the fact that the price of a book in the country of its publication must be enough to cover the cost of the first copy printed as well as the cost of the subsequent copies , and also enough to cover those advertising and other expenses without which the book will seek in vain for purchasers .

		Now in the case of an American edition of an English book , the task of creating a market falls upon the American publisher , which is a sufficient reason why he should not buy the books -LRB- or be taxed upon them -RRB- at the price prevailing in the English market .

		If he is required to do this , he simply can not publish the book at all .

		Concerning the share of the publisher in promoting the sale of a book , Mr.
Brett	PERSON	very justly says : '' If one of our very popular authors were asked as to why his book found such a multitude of readers , he would , I fear , in most cases answer that the public appreciated the value of the book , admired its many merits , and demanded it .

		If a similar question were put to one who knows from experience the publishing and bookselling trades , he would tell you , and rightly , that the publisher was entitled to at least a share of the credit for the large sale which the book attained . ''

		Furthermore , no one who understands the sub - ject will deny the conclusive character of the following statement from the same source : '' In importing a new book I am importing something which has not yet a value at all in the ordinary sense of the word , but something to which a value may be given . ''

		It is difficult to discuss a question like this with anything like patience , because the very idea of a duty on books is abhorrent to the cultivated intelligence , and the practice of im - posing such a duty in this country is utterly indefensible .

		It is not pleasant for a patriotic American to feel that in this matter his country
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		141 deliberately places itself upon a low plane of civilization , and occupies the position of reject - ing enlightenment and placing obstacles in the path of intellectual progress .

		When the Con - stitution gave to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the power of laying taxes for '' the general welfare , '' its framers would have been much amazed had they been told that this power would in time become so perverted as to include the taxation of knowl - edge .

		The argument for revenue is too trivial to be considered seriously , for our total annual importation of books is valued only at about a million and
a half of dollars	DATE	, of which probably one-third is duty free .

		As for the argument for protection , it is based upon a fallacy so transpar - ent that we do not see how it can impose upon a person of ordinary intelligence .

		One book does not compete with another in any real sense ; the man who wants a particular book will not purchase another book instead because the price is lower .

		He will either buy the book he wants or go without it , and in either case he will think profane thoughts of a government which sub - jects him to the petty irritation of such a duty .

		Of all the many interests so unrighteously shel - tered by our tariff laws none is so absolutely unreal as that which , in the name of protection , has thus far been successful in enforcing its demand for a tax upon American education and scholarship .

		The sheer folly and stupidity of the thing is so obvious that it does not seem possible that such a practice should long out - live the century that gave it birth .

		THE RE-COMING OF
ANTHONY TROLLOPE	PERSON	.

		A group of worshippers who have been faithful in their devotions at an all-bat-deserted literary shrine are looking up in pleased surprise to find the neglected altar grown gay with votive lights , and men hastening to perform their genuflections where formerly they passed by unheeding .

		St.
Anthony	PERSON	seems in a fair way to be given his place on the beadroll beside
St. William	LOCATION	,
St. Charles	LOCATION	, and
St. George	LOCATION	.

		To drop the metaphor .

		--
Anthony TroUope	PERSON	, who but a few years ago was thoaght of by the general reader , in the words of Professor Trent , merely as '' the man who wrote long novels to order in a mechanical fashion , '' and whom the critics were wont to name only to qaote the un - fortunate two-hundred-and-fifty-words-per-quarter - of-an-hour statement , is fast coming to his own again . ''

		Once again his name creates a stir of interest , '' says Mr.
Edward Fuller	PERSON	, writing on '' Real Forces in Literature '' in the
February	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' '' and his singularly vivid and vital characters ... are no longer caviare to all but the chosen few '' ; so that
Bareetshire	PERSON	may soon be almost as familiar to the novel-reading public as the year 's successor to
Ruritania	LOCATION	or Drumtochty .

		A curious chapter in the history of Victorian fic - tion is the neglect which suddenly overwhelmed th '' most popular English novelist of the period imme - diately succeeding that dominated by the two masters .

		How large was the number of
Anthony TroUope	PERSON	's readers the statistics in his autobiography prove , and those of us whose memory goes back to the old ''
Franklin	PERSON	Square Library '' of the pre-copy - right days will recollect .

		Yet almost immediately after his death , in
1881	DATE	, he was forgotten so com - i plet `` ly that hardly one in a hundred of the most i inveterate novel-readers of the present generation ' but would be puzzled by a reference to Mrs. , Proudie or the
Duke of Omnium	ORGANIZATION	.

		Popularity , it is true , is an inadequate test of an author 's claim to 1 permanency .

		There are a few books that are sell - ing their hundreds of thousands ^ to-day , which yet -- to put it mildly -- are not likely to find a place on j the shelves with the classics ; but
Trollope	LOCATION	lived I before the art of book advertising had reached itS ' ; present pitch of perfection , and his popularity wa '' - \ one legitimately earned among discriminating readers .

		His sudden decline from favor may be partially accounted for by the fact that , as it were , I he outlived himself .

		Achieving success with '' Th '' ; Warden '' in
1855	DATE	, he published novels at an amas - I ingly rapid rate for almost thirty years .

		At the last , he fell into the error against which he warned ^ other novelists , and wrote , as he has put it , not be - ' cause he had a story to tell , but because he had to tell a story .

		But since ''
Anne	PERSON	of Geierstein '' and `` Count Robert of
Paris	LOCATION	'' have not caused us to forget '' Ivanhoe '' and '' Waverley , '' and since '' Lovel the Widower '' has not dimmed the glory of `` Vanity Fair , '' the writer who gave us `` The
Small House	ORGANIZATION	at AUington , '' '' Barchester Towers , ' * '' and ''
Phineas Finn	PERSON	'' may well be forgiven '' The Duke 's Children , '' `` Mr.
Scarborough	PERSON	's Family , '' and other late productions of a pen which did not cease from activity when the brain of its wielder had lost its freshness .

		For even when the dozen or more novels that most readers who were not Trollope devotees would characterize as '' respect - ably dull '' are omitted from the list , there remain among
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's works not far from a score of novels , outclassed , it is true , by the masterpieces of the grants who were his contemporaries , but by them alone .

		We have from him nothing in which we feel the force of inspiration , -- indeed , how often do we feel that in fiction , except when the
Bernstein	PERSON	, speaks to
Harry Warrington	PERSON	, beneath the
Kneller	PERSON	portrait of
Beatrix	LOCATION	, or when the little govemesv avows her passion to her master and lover ?

		But even though we admit that
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	never reached the heights found by two or three other English novelists , the writer who described the death of Mr.
Harding	PERSON	and gave us the scene in the episcopal palace between the curate and the diocesan tyrant ' 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	.

		in petticoats , deserved a better fate than the ob - livion from which he is only now being rescued .

		The quality which has invariably been recog - nized , by even the least favorable of his critics , and which makes him quite unapproachable on his own ground , is his absolute naturalness .

		In all his books there is no single touch of exaggeration .

		Not one of his characters talks in a fashion too fine or too • melodramatic for real life ; not the divine
Jane	PERSON	^ herself was freer from any taint of the '' big bow - ■ wow style . ''

		To quote
Hawthorne	PERSON	's formerly fa - miliar praise , his books are '' as real as if some : giant bad hewn a great lump out of the earth and .

		put it under a glass case , with all its inhabitants going about their business , and not suspecting that they were being watched . ''

		The complications which form the plots are precisely such as occur to us ■ daily ^ -- or rather , such as might have occurred to U8 if we had happened to be members of the upper ' midde-class in the
England	LOCATION	of the sixties .

		The ef - forts of a clergyman to secure promotion ; the in - trigues of the mother of a slender-pursed young man to gain her son a wealthy bride , or to prevent ` him from losing his heart to a dowerless maiden ; ` the troubles of a vicar who has imprudently got into debt , -- these are the every-day matters which ` Trollope treats of , so that we feel , more than with - any other author , that the distance between that world which lies between the covers of a book and the one which lies outside of them is very slight .

		And yet it is an injustice to recognize in him , as many have done , merely the merit of accurate por - traiture .

		There is a delicacy in some of his best work which proves him an artist , not a photo - grapher .

		In '' The Warden , '' the character of Mr.
Harding	PERSON	, the gentle and lovable old clergyman whose sense of honor will not permit him to retain his living a ` fter the suggestion has been made that the stipend attached to it is unjustly large , is drawn with a marvellously fine touch .

		Mr.
Harding	PERSON	has ■ been compared to
Colonel Newcome	LOCATION	; it is high praise , but the two are kin .

		In the other volumes ■ of the Barsetshire series , in which the story of Mr.
Harding	PERSON	and his clerical neighbors is continued , we have the terrible and wonderful Mrs.
Proudie	PERSON	.

		In his life of
Thackeray	PERSON	, TroUope says that Sir
Pitt Crawley	PERSON	has always been to him a stretch of au - dacity which he was unable to understand .

		The picture of the henpecked bishop and his vulgarly ` formidable helpmeet comes near to equalling
Thackeray	PERSON	's daring sketch of his old reprobate of ■ a baronet .

		There are not many better scenes any - where in fiction than the glorious one in which the ■ hitherto unconquered Mrs.
Proudie	PERSON	meets defeat at the hands of the poverty-stricken curate ,
Crawley	PERSON	.

		Trollope noted
Thackeray	PERSON	's evident enjoyment in writing `` Barry Lyndon '' ; the discomfiture of Mrs.
Proudie	PERSON	must have been as enjoyable in the writing ■ as in the reading .

		One of
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's strongest claims to be ranked among the great novelists of his day has perhaps never been sufficiently considered .

		It is not the least of his merits that his women are as true to life as are his men .

		Most of us will be ready to agree with Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	when he admits that the male novel - ist is apt to find himself upon uncertain ground when dealing with his heroines .

		Is it the unpardonable sin to say that the pencil of even the greatest mas - ter of Victorian fiction lacked sureness of touch in drawing women ?

		Putting Becky apart as hors con - cours , what have we in
Amelia	LOCATION	,
Helen	PERSON	,
Theo	LOCATION	.

		Lam - bert ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	, perhaps even Laura toward the last , but the descendants of that other
Amelia	LOCATION	, Fielding 's Mrs. Booth , who was the admiration of the later novelist , and whose portrait shows appreciation of one most admirable trait of femininity , but no very wide or deep knowledge of the sex ?

		A conviction of their capacity for immeasurable devotion , and of their utter unreasonableness and inconsistency , would perhaps sum up
Thackeray	PERSON	's articles of faith regarding women .

		Nor was
Thackeray	PERSON	himself by any means sure that his portraits were faithful ; for the frequent allusions to feminine hypocrisy and powers of dissimulation indicate an uneasy conscious - ness that he was on terra incognita when bis heroines were in question .

		With
Trollope	PERSON	there is nothing of the kind .

		He was at no time impressed witb the need of taking his women with painful serious - ness , and we have no laborious studies of the subtle in femininity such as later writers have given us .

		His heroines are without exception concerned with the simple everyday theme of '' she would and she would not '' and its variations , merging at times into the equally simple but less agreeable '' she would but he would not . ''

		And in dealing with these affairs of the heart , '' the apostle of the com - monplace , '' as some contemptuous critic once dubbed
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	, was preeminently successful .

		He has given us more and better pictures of the English girl in love than all his fellows together .

		What differentiates his galaxy of heroines from the amiable inanities plentiful enough in the pages of his contemporaries is the fact that they have brains as well as heart .

		Although
Trollope	PERSON	wrote in the days when
Girton	PERSON	and Newnham were not ,
Lily Dale	PERSON	,
Lucy Robarts	PERSON	,
Mary Thorne	PERSON	, and all the rest of the numerous group , are perfectly sensible as well as lovable . ''

		On pouvait les marier toutes , '' as
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	said of his ingenues , for a different rea - son .


Lily Dale	PERSON	deserves to rank as the chief of bis girl heroines , and in the telling of her love-story
Trollope	PERSON	did some of his best work .

		She appears in two books ; the second , '' The Last Chronicles of Barset , '' being perhaps
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece .

		She was a favorite with his readers , though not with him .

		He tells us that he considered her somewhat of a prig ; but then we know that
Thackeray	PERSON	entertained a similar opinion concerning
Colonel Esmond	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her story is simple enough .

		Her lover jilts her that he may make a more advantageous marriage .

		The deserted maiden is usually an ex - cuse for the sentimental in literature ; but
Trollope	LOCATION	steers clear of everything of the sort , and there is not much in realistic fiction which shows so strong

		The under-bred young woman of the

Trollope	ORGANIZATION	chose to make somewhat complex .

		Ladv Laura rejects the love offered her , choosing , though not wholly selfishly , wealth and position instead ; and makes shipwreck of her life in consequence .

		The skill with which
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	has shown the strength of the woman 's passion for the man she would fain persuade herself she regards as a friend ; her misery at realizing that his facile love has gone from her , and that he is entirely content with the position allotted him ; the utter abandonment of her grief when he finally passes out of her life , -- the combi - nation of power and delicacy in his management of this theme , osnally left to writers distinctly not rir ^ inibus pverisjue , is something unique in the fiction of the period when novelists had not yet shaken off the timidity inherited from an age so awkwardly squeamish as to necessitate Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's being `` turned out of the ' Cornhill ' for indecency . ''

		The present generation of readers has much to be grateful for in the restoration of
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	.

		Forty novels , none of them poor and many admirable , are a treasure-trove indeed .

		* That theme of perennial interest , the per - Bonality of a great man , furnishes Mr.
Sidney Whitman	PERSON	with material for a very attractive book in his `` Personal Reminiscences of Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	. ''

		Although these glimpses of the
Iron Chancellor	ORGANIZATION	offer little that is new , one gladly welcomes so able a presentation , with amplification and detail , of the old .

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's acquaintance with
Bismarck	PERSON	began a short time before the latter 's retirement from office , and we are told that he visited the great statesman no fewer than ten times between
1891	DATE	and
1898	DATE	, being in fact the only English - man now living who enjoyed anything like an intimate acquaintance with him .

		He seems to have come completely under the spell of
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck 's magnetic personality , and he writes in terms of enthusiastic admiration of the man , warmly defending him against all assault and disparagement .

		Again and again his indigna - tion speaks out at the shabby treatment ac - corded the unifier of
Germany	LOCATION	by an ungrate - ful sovereign and that sovereign 's retainers .

		It is this spirit of championship that gives the book a note of fervor and helps to raise it above the grade of hack work to which such memora - biUa too often belong .

		Incidentally the writer dwells on the imperfect state of unification which he sees in the still youthful Empire , as contrasted with the more settled order of things in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The socialist peril he holds to be especially threatening there , because of this imperfect solidarity and stability .

		No one can contemplate
Bismarck	PERSON	's closing years without admiring the greatness of soul , the imperturbable calm , with which , on the whole , he accepted his retirement to private life and refused to be embittered by what most have seemed to him ingratitude and malignity .

		His conversation , as reported to us , is never sour , no offensive personalities are indulged in , no trace of repining or resentment mars the dignity of his utterance .

		Some excerpts from his friendly chat with Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	will best serve to illustrate the character of the book .

		Speaking of the routine of court life , he related the following : '' It was ocea ^ onaUy one of my fanctions to present • Pkesokai , RExnnBCKNCxs of

		In good old colony times , When we lived under a king , Three roguish chaps Fell into mishaps Because they could not sing , ' etc. '' Presently follows another rollicking bit of English verse , which the
Countess Rantzau	PERSON	joined her father in repeating with great gusto .

		The daughter added that her father remem - bered many more rhymes which he learned from his English and American fellow students at
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		The author indulges in a page or more of curiously strenuous protest against the charge that his country ,
England	LOCATION	, is lapsing into the cold-water habit , and he complacently closes the argument for the defense by recording that
Bismarck	PERSON	smiled approvingly at the patriotic fervor with which he attested his country 's bibulous propensities ; all of which would do very well for bierkneipe oratory , but looks strange in sober print .

		An item of some interest concerning the lately deceased
Chevalier de Blowitz	ORGANIZATION	is worth quoting here . ''

		I had long harbored an idea that the real hero of the
Berlin Congress	LOCATION	was neither Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	nor Lord Beaconsfleld , but the
Chevalier de Blowitz	ORGANIZATION	.

		For whereas
Bismarck	PERSON	had only played the uninteresting part of an ' honest broker ' and Lord
Beaconsfleld	PERSON	had been obliged to rest satisfied with a compromise with
Russia	LOCATION	, the gifted correspondent of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	achieved next to the impossible ; he surpassed himself .

		He beat his own record by sending the
Berlin	LOCATION	Treaty to the Times before the original draft was even signed .

		What Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	told me at
Varzin	ORGANIZATION	confirmed me in my surmise as to the prominent part played by this prince of journalists at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		For this exploit the enterprising journalist received from the Prussian government the second class of the Order of the Crown , an unprecedented distinction .

		The recent exchange of
Germany	LOCATION	's position in
Zanzibar	LOCATION	for the island of Heligoland met with
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's strong disapproval .

		He re - garded the island as not worth the heavy ex - pense necessary to put it into a defensible condition .

		Its possession by
England	LOCATION	had pre - vented its use as a coaling station by any con - tinental power , which explains why in
1870	DATE	the operations of the French navy were so in - effective , the fleet being obliged to return re - peatedly to a French port to coal .

		On the subject of
South Africa	LOCATION	, when asked whether he had ever said that quarter of the globe might yet be the scene of a life-and-death struggle for the British Empire ,
Bismarck	PERSON	replied that he did not remember having said so , but he might have thought it .

		That was nearly twelve years ago .

		Toward Gladstone he expressed not the slightest personal dislike , but confined himself to the humorous intima - tion that his English contemporary was wont to quibble with words and had ended by be - coming their victim .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's feeling for
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	is thought to have been less free from acrimony .

		Bismarck felt great admira - tion for
Carlyle	PERSON	, who reciprocated the sen - timent , extolling the German statesman as a '' monster of industry . ''

		Of
Max Miiller	PERSON	his great countryman had a poor opinion , holding him to be an overrated man .

		The learned scholar 's dabbling in politics condemned him in the other 's eyes .

		The account of
Bismarck	LOCATION	's eightieth-birthday celebration gives a good idea of his popularity .

		Besides the throngs that paid him homage in person , nearly half a million letters and more than ten thousand telegrams came pouring in upon him .

		Both the
Reichstag	LOCATION	, however , and the
Berlin	LOCATION	Town Council voted not to send him a congratulatory message .

		Whence they took their note it is not hard to surmise ; but
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck turned the tables very cleverly by the neat wording of his answer to the Emperor 's telegram expressing indignation at the
Reich	PERSON	- stag 's conduct .

		He assured the
Kaiser	PERSON	that the action of his opponents had proved a source of

		THE DIAL 146 special gratification to him by calling forth his Majesty 's gracious words of sympathy .

		The academic honors conferred upon the nation 's hero on this occasion , as well as before and after , must amuse the non - German reader .

		He was made first a doctor of philosophy by the
University of Halle	ORGANIZATION	; then a doctor of laws by
Gottingen	LOCATION	, and later by
Erlangen	LOCATION	; next a doc - tor of political science by
Tiibingen	LOCATION	;
Giessen	LOCATION	surpassed her academic sisters by conferring on him the doctorate of theology ; and finally
Jena	PERSON	did herself proud by making him a doctor beyond all possibility of a doubt , -- a doctor of medicine .

		The reader will close Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's book , after some hours in the company of a truly gentle and refined as well as masterful and courageous nature , much inclined to hold him worthy of all the honors he received .

		A new emphasis has been placed upon those warmly human qualities for which the Iron Chancellor , despite his nickname , must always be an object of interest and , to many of his countrymen , of affection .

		The book is unquestionably a valu - able addition to the already extensive and still increasing mass of
Bismarckiana	LOCATION	.

		A German edition appears simultaneously with the En - glish , and some features of the author 's English style would almost suggest that he had written the work originally in German and then given as a translation .

		However that may be , his early education in
Germany	LOCATION	will explain the occasional Teutonisms , -- as , for instance , '' to hold a speech . ''

		and '' is '' for '' has been '' to denote a past state continued into the present .

		It would be too harsh to call the writer a linguistic orphan , without a mother tongue , because he has grown up speaking several languages ; but all who are thus reared tend to use language as an implement rather than as an organ .

		A little less rhetorical confectionery here and there in the volume , and the omission of the solemn Amen at its close , would have done the book no harm in the eyes of plain people like the present reviewer .

Mnnson Aldrieh Havens	PERSON	, is the first in a aeries of monographs on '' Famous Presses , '' pro- jected by Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	fiuddy of the
Kirgate Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an interesting essay , of a purely descriptive sort , illustrated with reproductions of
Strawberry Hill	ORGANIZATION	title - pages and excellent portraits of
Walpole	LOCATION	and his prin - ter ,
Thomas Kirgate	PERSON	.

		The volume is printed on hand - made paper , in an edidon limited to three hundred `` opies .

		Since the '' English Men of Letters '' series took a new lease of life
last summer	DATE	, the vol - umes have followed one another in rapid sao - cession .

		In addition to the three that we re - yiewed some time ago , no less than four othera now call for attention .

		We will begin with a few words about the '' Tennyson '' volume , which has been prepared by Sir
Alfred Lyall	PERSON	.

		It was no easy matter to write appropriately of the great Victorian poet .

		Originality of treat - ment could hardly be hoped for , considering the amount of critical attention that has been lavished upon Tennyson by other writers , and considering also the fact that several other books of about the same size and scope as the present one are already in existence .

		But Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's series was bound to include a ''
Tenny	PERSON	- son '' just as it is bound some time to include the '' Shakespeare '' thus far omitted , and a reading of Sir
Alfred	PERSON	's volume shows that the author has performed his task gracefully and with delicate sympathy .

		In particular , he gives due attention to
Tennyson	PERSON	's philosophy , as well as to the dramatic section of his work , so often imperfectly appreciated , and to the poems of his last years , so often underrated .

		The anthor is slightly hypercritical at times , as when he speaks of the verse , '' Unirenal Oeeaa softly washine all her warleas
Uea	ORGANIZATION	, '' and calls it '' logically perplexing '' to suggest that '' the sea would become calm when the land should be at peace . ''

		English poetry would be much the poorer were all its pathetic fallacies ruled oat of court .

		Misquotations also occur , as '' Home they brought their warrior dead , '' and '' Many a night I saw the Pleiades , '' in which latter instance the metre is rained by the extra syllable .

		Sir
Alfred	PERSON	's difficulty was found in the fact that his work had been done by other writers so many times before ; the difficulty of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, in preparing the ''
Ruskin	PERSON	'' volume for this series , was found in the fact that he himself had written and published else - where the greater part of what such a work as the present must include .

		146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, .

		if a better man could have been discovered for the task , and are quite willing to overlook Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's inevitable repetitions of himself .

		He is peculiarly fitted to write about
Ruskin	PERSON	because , on the one hand , his sympathy is un - failing , and , on the other , he can bring to the many subjects which
Ruskin	PERSON	discussed a degree of sound knowledge which enables him to state clearly the many logical defects of the series of books that extends from '' Modern Painters '' to '' Praeterita . ''

		The following sentence is typical of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's treatment : `` Original and heterodox as his science was , we come from time to time on intuitions of scientific truth , which strike us like those we meet in the poetry of Shakespeare or of Goethe . ''

		What is said from the standpoint of personal ac - quaintance with
Ruskin	PERSON	is singularly charming and felicitous .

		We quote two passages .

		`` I have talked with
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, with
Victor Hugo and Mazzini	PERSON	, with
Garibaldi	PERSON	and with
Gambetta	PERSON	, with
John Bright	PERSON	and with
Robert Browning	PERSON	, but no one of these ever impressed me more vividly with a sense of intense personality , with the inexplicable light of genius which seemed to well up spontaneously from heart and brain .

		It remains a psychological puzzle how one who could write with passion and scorn such as
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	never reached , who in print was so often Athanasius contra mundum , who opened every written assertion with ' I know , ' was in private life one of the gentlest , gayest , humblest of men . ''

		Our second quotation is this beautiful account of the
evening	TIME	of
Ruskin	PERSON	's life : '' So , eleven years later , but a year or so before his death , I found him in his quiet Brantwood home , -- to look at just like
Lear	PERSON	in the last scene , but perfectly reposeful , gentle , and happy , taking the air of the fells with delight , joining in games or reading with the family at intervals , but for the most part sitting in his library and softly turning over the pages of a poem , a tale of
Walter Scott	PERSON	or Dickeus , or some illustrated volume of views , himself in a bower of roses and gay flowers ; silently and for long intervals together gazing with a far-off look of yearning , but no longer of eagerness , at the blue hills of the
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	Old Man , across the rip - pling lake , as if -- half child again , half wayworn pil - grim -- he saw there the
Delectable Mountains	LOCATION	where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest . ''

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, as we all know , has the amiable weakness of preaching Comtism and the relig - ion of humanity both in and out of season , and the reader of this volume must be pre - pared to learn that
Ruskin	PERSON	was an unconscious Comtist all the while ; on the whole , we are rather inclined to thank the author for not hav - ing labored this point as much as was to be expected .

		The choice of Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	for the volume devoted to
Samuel Richardson	PERSON	is quite unexceptionable .

		No one knows the literature and the life of the eighteenth century better than he , no one is more scrupulously accurate in statement , more skilful in the marshalling of facts , or more pleasing as a writer of biog - raphy mingled with criticism .

		In the present case , he has made a dull subject fairly inter - esting , for the life of
Richardson	PERSON	is certainly material of a rather unpromising sort .

		The critical study of his writings is another matter , and the study of their place in the historical de - velopment of the modern novel ; but the limits of the series do not allow much philosophizing , and the author has had to keep himself under close restraint .

		We quote the brief passage in which he compares the three novels . ''

		That '
Clarissa	PERSON	' is
Richardson	PERSON	's masterpiece , there can be no doubt .

		For '
Pamela	PERSON	' is but an incondite production , which really ends in the second of its four volumes , while in '
Grandison	PERSON	, ' though the manner is perfected , and the method matured , the movement of the story for the most part advances no more than a rocking-horse .

		But in '
Clarissa	PERSON	' the simplicity of the central idea , the nnhasting yet unresting evolution of the tragedy , and , above all , the extraordinary ability exhibited in the portraiture of the two leading person - ages , raise it immeasurably above either its forerunner or its successor . ''

		For many years ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	has remained the only American included in the series of biographies now under consideration .

		The editor and publishers have now , however , let down the bars , and arranged for the admission of a number of volumes upon American au - thors , entrusting their preparation to American hands .

		The first of these new American vol - umes is devoted to
Whittier	LOCATION	, and is written by
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	.

		The author has the advantage of having known
Whittier	LOCATION	well for many years , of having him - self lived in the locality with which the poet is chiefly identified , and of having been a fellow - worker with him in the abolitionist movement and in other philanthropic causes .

		He makes extensive use of Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	's biography , and supplements the facts thus credited by means of lengthy extracts from '' Snowbound '' and other poems of a distinctly autobiographical character .

		Extracts from
Whittier	LOCATION	's writings in prose and verse make up a large part of the volume .

		Our chief criticism of the work must be that the poet is rather obscured by the reformer ; we do not get from it anything like an adequate discussion of
Whittier	LOCATION	's poetry .

		To a certain extent this criticism also holds of the account of
Longfellow	LOCATION	which
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	has just published in the series of
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 '' American Men of Letters , '' and illustrates the disadvantage of knowing one 's subject too welL In both cases , personal matters seem to have so crowded upon the author 's interest as to restrict the space that might fairly have been claimed for the consideration of literary achievement .

		But the books of the American are larger than those of the English series , so that there is less cause for complaint on the score of inadequacy .

		Here , as in the previous instance , the author has relied largely upon the standard biography of the poet , but he has also had other sources of information , hitherto not much exploited .

		These are specified as the correspondence of the first Mrs.
Longfellow	PERSON	, certain manuscript volumes known as the ''
Harvard College Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' and a collection of the poet 's own early writings not included in the standard editions .

		There is also , as a matter of course , the contribution of personal acquaintance , although the author 's association with
Longfellow	PERSON	was less intimate than with
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		A few sentences from the conclud - ing paragraph of this book are worth quoting . ''

		It will perhaps be found , as time goes on , that the greatest service rendered by
Longfellow	LOCATION	-- beyond all personal awakening or stimulns exerted on his readers -- was that of being the first conspicnous representa - tive , in an eminently practical and hard-working com - munity , of the literary life .

		One of a circle of enperior men , he was the only one who stood for that life purely and snpremely , and thus indicated its national impor - tance ... Considered merely as an antidote to mate - rialism , such a life was of incalculable value .

		Looking at him , the reign of the purely materialistic , however much aided by organizing genius , was plainly self - limited ; the modest career of
Longfellow	LOCATION	outshone it in the world 's arena .

		Should that reign henceforth grow never so potent , the best offset to its most arrogant claims will be found , for years to come , in the memory of his name . ''

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's life of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, contrib - uted many years ago to the series of • ' Amer - ican Men of Letters , '' bears the distinction of being the best of the dozen or more volumes published before the present resuscitation of the enterprise .

		Its only fault was a slight defect of sympathy , and this was more than counter - balanced by its painstaking thoroughness and its admirable critical insight .

		Against Profes - sor
Woodberry	PERSON	's ''
Hawthorne	PERSON	, '' now published , no charge of defective sympathy is fairly to be laid , while the positive excellences are as con - spicuous as in the earlier work .

		There is pos - sibly a little too much of strictly bibliographical detail , such as the tracing of the many short stories through their successive forms of publi - cation , but this is not a serious matter .

		The author 's style is always grave , well-poised , and pregnant with thought .

		We must quote a part of what he says about
Hawthorne	PERSON	's two books of Greek legend . ''

		A multitude of children have loved these books , for whom their very names are a part of the golden haze of memory ; and , in view of the association of Haw - thorne 's genius and temperament with quite other themes and the darker element in grown lives , this band of children makes a kind of halo round his figure .

		Whether the thing done should have been so done , whether Greek should have been turned into
Gothie	PERSON	, is a foolish matter .

		To please a child is warrant enough for any work ; and here romantic fancy plays arouud the beantifnl forms and noble suggestion of old heroic and divine life , and marries them to the hillside and fireside of
New England	LOCATION	childhood with the naturalnea * of a fairy enchantment ; these tales are truly tranft - planted into the minds of the little ones with whose youngest tendrils of imagination they are intertwined .

		... If to wake and feed the imagination and charm it , and fill the budding mind with the true springtime of the soul 's life in beautiful images , noble thoughts , and brooding moods that have in them the infinite sug - gestion , be success for a writer who would minister to - the childish heart , few books can be thought to equal these ; and the secret of it lies in the wandering sena '' which
Hawthorne	PERSON	had of the mystical in childhood , of that element of purity in being which is felt also in hi '' reverence for womanhood , and which whether in child or woman , was typical of the purity of the soul itself -- in a word , the spiritual sense of life . ''

		Such a passage as this illustrates , better than any descriptive comment , the gifts of sympathy and of literary art that the author has brought to this study of the greatest of American writers of imaginative prose .

		* Those garden-lovers who lived happy days in the pages of Miss Jekyll 's '' Wood and Garden '' and '' Home and Garden , '' and who found her '' Lilies for English Gardens '' so satisfying in its kind , will turn eagerly to her book on '' Roses for English Gardens '' with equal anticipation of pleasure and profit .

		But the book is disappointing ; a rose-lover says that all books on roses are disappointing , for they can not approach the charm of the rose itself .

		The old garden roses , such as the Scotch roses , brier roses , the
Madame Plantier	ORGANIZATION	, an old favorite , the damask rose , the
Ayrshire Toses	LOCATION	, with the oldest rose of all ,
Rosa Alba	PERSON	, form beautiful pictures .

		But when another flower is added , as in the lovely picture of White Lilies and Damask Roses , or of Roses and
Larkspur	LOCATION	, the artistic effect is wonderfully increased .

		The most interesting plates are those showing the roses trained upon old barns , • tree stumps , and waste and barren spots , turn - ing them into things of beauty .

		Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	has a genius for that sort of thing , and her chapter upon '' Roses for Converting Ugliness into Beauty '' is an agreeable and valuable one .

		Mr.
Mawley	PERSON	's share of the book can well be conveyed by giving his chapter head - ings : '' Planting Roses , '' '' Pruning Roses , '' * ' Propagating Roses , '' '' Enemies of the Rose , '' * ' Exhibiting Roses , '' '' Roses under Glass , '' * ' Some Lists of the Best Roses for Various Uses . ''

		Prosaic titles these are , and of neces - sity treated with simplicity and plainness of speech , but treated with dignity , and , to the Tose-grower , with interest .

		The list of Garden Soses for various places and times is , of course , of little value to the American rose-grower .

		The dates are absolutely useless , and in many cases the roses named will not live at all in our
Northern States	LOCATION	.

		Of course this also holds true of
Miss Jekyll	LOCATION	's lists ; and for the Amer - ican rose-grower her book is no way as useful as Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	's standard work on `` The Kose . ''

		Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's pleasant and profitable advice as to rose pergolas , rose arches , rose pillars , rose screens , etc. , is of course most grateful to read and useful to heed .

		So also is her chapter on Rose-Gardens -- vexed question !

		She is impatient , as are many , of the usual rose - garden , -- a sort of target of concentric rings or other regular form , set upon turf , with little connected design with the remainder of the garden ; yet she gives little definite instruc - tion , save to have ever a background of ever - green trees of some kind for the roses to run upon , as cypress , yew , and holly .

		As neither of these three thrives with us , or indeed will hardly grow at all in many localities , this chapter also is of little value to Americans .

		Many of the roses of these English gardens will not grow here ; but we in turn have roses which are not even named in this book , -- among them all the hearty sturdy roses of the
Michigan	LOCATION	sisterhood , the
Baltimore Belle	LOCATION	, Queen of the Prairie , Gem of the Prairie , and the single pink
Michigan	LOCATION	itself , roses that have all the vigor , stanchness , and freshness of the new world , of the prairie .

		While the platitudes of gardening have filled many of our recent garden-books and received ill-merited praise , it is regrettable that so deserving a work as '' In a Tuscan Garden '' should have received so little atten - tion .

		The book is a charming one , -- well written , one of the best of the year upon what - ever subject ; full of interest , and of informa - tion on many topics besides gardening and flowers .

		It gives absolutely the best and most practical advice I have ever seen printed with regard to the relations between Italian land - lords and their tenants , especially English tenants ; and this from an experience of twenty years .

		The book would hence be invaluable to anyone intending an Italian residence in a rented villa .

		The snags and snares of domestic service , of housekeeping , of household arrange - ments , are set forth in so concise and direct a fashion , with such good advice added , that we are well equipped for action , and are in - structed while we are amused .

		One chapter , on '' Tuscan Courts of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, '' is so informed with experience , so founded upon accuracy , so tempered with good sense , as to be of value far beyond the words of any ordinary legal adviser .

		But the book is not all useful infor - mation .

		In the chapter upon the treatment of animals in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the view taken of it by the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, we welcome as friends the author 's own pets ,
Jack	PERSON	the Persian cat ,
Rosina	PERSON	the parrot , and the glorious macaws ,
Madame Blue	ORGANIZATION	and her husband
Alfredo	PERSON	, who , after ten years of affectionate ornithological matrimony of which he was the masculine part , actually laid an egg .

		This chapter is of the highest grade of humor , and of sincere pathos , too .

		As the print is very close and page margins narrow , the 415 pages of the book afford us many words upon an infinite variety of sub - jects .

		The finding , planting , and development of the garden is as satisfying from the point of sentiment as is the practical detailed advice upon gardens , upon the Mezzaria system of employment , the regard and study of climate , etc. ; but the garden-part does not predominate , and it seems to be rather the book of a flower - lover , an out-of-door decorator and colorist , rather than of a practical gardener .

		The book has eight illustrations , of which three are of the garden , and are frankly commonplace ; one is amusingly ugly .

		* At the present writing , there is a Inll in the agitation of the Trnst problem , although it still continues to occupy an important place in the public mind , and probably will continue to do so until remedial legislation takes place , or it is denMNisbated that such legislation is unwise or impoasiUe .

		While nothing new has been recently added in the way of legislative oontroL , much gain has been made in public sentiment through the realization that former legislation which sought in effect the destruction of the Trust and the prevention of combination was not only inadequate but futile and ill-advised .

		There is a better understanding of the Trust by legislators and by the public , which brings a sober second-thought that there are benefits in combination which may be turned to public service by proper legislative control .

		More - over , the economic principles involved in the question are coming to the front , and it is be - coming clearly understood that it is not merely the arbitrary ruling of a few men that must be considered , but the vital existence of the pres - ent economic system .

		While the question is better understood , the difficulties of the prob - lem have increased and have changed agitation into thoughtfulness and radicals to conserva - tives .

		The voluminous writings on this subject that have appeared in the form of books , magazine articles , and newspaper comment , have been a source of publicity and enlightenment .

		While it is nearly all recent , this literature is already mostly obsolete , because much of it was writ - ten without a full diagnosis of the case , and because of the constant shifting of the question as it has developed .

		last year by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- edited by Mr.
A. P. C. Griffin	PERSON	-RRB- contained something over 450 titles , nearly all of works that ap - peared within the last fifteen years .

		Much of this matter is superficial or fragmentary , but as a whole it fairly represents the subject .

		Since this bibliography was published , the contribu - tions to the discussion have continued to in - crease .

		There is to be noted a decided improve - ment in their tone and quality , which is a hopeful sign that we shall some day know more defi - nitely what may be and what may not be done , and arrive at a proper solution of the problem .

		Pending legislation is suggestive of a marked advance in rational thought on the subject , brought about in part by the report of the In - dustrial
Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the investigation now being conducted by the commission on the Anthracite Coal-strike .

		It seems to be generally conceded that com - bination can not be prevented ; that the Trust appears most frequently in the form of a great corporation ; that it has its advantages as well as its evils , and that legislation should seek to suppress its evils and enlarge and distribute its benefits .

		In order to do this , legislation should prevent the secret rebate on railroads , modify the tariff wherein it favors Trusts -LRB- wherever this can be done without crushing the inde - pendent producer -RRB- , remove the `` clubs '' with which the combine seeks to destroy the in - dependent operator , remodel the corporation laws which were made for pygmies and not for giants , and insist on publicity of all corpora - tions for the protection of investors , producers , and operators .

		The two volumes referred to in this review are both valuable contributions to the literature of the Trust , but of widely different nature .

		So far as publicity and enlightenment go , they add much to the fund of information , although the opinions expressed by the authors are not always conclusive .

		The book of Mr.
Bolen	PERSON	, '' Plain Facts as to Trusts and the Tariff , '' is valuable as presenting in small compass all of the salient points relating to the Trust , and to the Tariff adso so far as this relates to the for - mer .

		As its title suggests , the work abounds in facts rather than in philosophy , although the author does not hesitate to express his opinion dogmatically and with force when occasion presents .

		After a rather brief review of the '' Origin and Purpose '' of the Trust , the au - thor gives a fair presentation of its `` Possibility for Good and Evil . ''

		Subsequently he discusses Monopoly in several chapters of different titles .

		`` The Railroad Problem '' receives a fair share of attention .

		After presenting the usual arguments for and against it , the author points out conclusively the need of its reform .

		It is a thoroughly useful and interesting book , largely because it places fact above philosophy , and of - fers no panacea for ills inherent in the system .

		Entirely different in style and purpose is '' The Trust : Its Book , '' written -- appro - priately -- by a '' syndicate '' for the purpose of showing the necessity and advantage of the Trust .

		Usually such books are not as satis - factory as those written by a single author , although in this instance each writer under - stands his subject well and presents it ener - getically from his own standpoint .

		The book emphasizes the importance of the Trust as an es - sential part of our industrial system , and shows its advantage as a productive agent .

		It shows , too , how the
Trust	ORGANIZATION	reaches its roots deep down into our economic life .

		The chapters by Mr.
Charles Flint	PERSON	, on '' Combinations and Critics , '' `` The Gospel of Industrial Steadiness , '' `` The Trust , an Alliance of Work , Brains , and Money , '' and '' What Combination has done for Labor and Capital , '' are remarkable in defining the nature of the service rendered by the Trust .

		Other chapters in the book sup - port this central idea , and picture the Trust as an essential product of our individualistic system of politics and economics .

		After reading both these books , one can not fail to believe that it is not capital that people fear , for that is essential ; not centralization , for that is inevitable ; not monopoly , for that may be turned to serve the public ; but it is the evils of the Trust monopoly , the dangers of selfish greed , the exploitation of humanity for gain , political corruption through corporate cupidity , and the suppression of independent endeavor , that represent the real evils of the Trust as they exist to-day .

		The one hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, which occurs next
May	DATE	, will be sig - nalized by the appearance of the initial volumes in a complete and definitive '' Centenary '' edition of his works , from the press of
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's authorized publishers .

		The most inter - esting feature of the edition will be the inclusion of one or two volumes of hitherto unpublished material .

		Recent Books on Music * ''
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	is never large or heroic ; he never wears the buskin .

		He has neither the depth of passion nor the intellectual grasp needed to make music in the grand style .

		Probably of all his peculiarities the most sig - nificant is the shortness of his phrases and his manner of repeating them almost literally , displaced a little in pitch , but not otherwise altered .

		Almost all his music can be cut up into segments two or four measures long , each segment complete in itself , an entire musical thought . ''

		The foregoing paragraph , relative to the musifr of
Edvard Grieg	ORGANIZATION	, gives one a clear idea of the analytical ability shown by Mr.
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	in the studious work entitled '' From
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	to
Brahms	PERSON	. ''

		In a prefatory note , the author seeks to show that all music ^ no matter what its complexity on the technical side , is in essence an expression of personal feeling ; and as the qualities of a man 's person - ality show themselves not only in his works , but in his acts , his words , his face , and his carriage even , it has seemed natural and fruit - ful , in these studies , to seek acquaintance with the musicians through acquaintance with the men .

		Therefore his essays on the art and ser - vices of
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	,
Dvorak	LOCATION	, Saint-Saens ,
Franck	PERSON	,
Tschaikowsky	LOCATION	, and
Brahms	PERSON	are a unique study of music through the personalities of the ar - tists treated . ''

		If we would understand the in - dividual composers , we must have a sense of the scheme into which they fall , the great universal evolution of which they are but incidents . ''

		Ar - ranging them in the order of their influence on art , which depends upon their power both to assimilate previous resources and to add new ones , he passes '' from Grieg to
Brahms	PERSON	. ''

		^ To give an idea of the principles worked out in this general plan of analysis , the author sketches in an introductory essay the musical environment , as determined by basic principle * and developed in history , in relation to which alone the individual discussed can be under - stood .

Grieg	PERSON	has the quick and ardent temperament of

		THE DIAL 151
Stevenson	PERSON	; shows us that
Saint-Saens	PERSON	's ver - satility and energy are the salient traits of his typically Gallic nature ; that passing from Saint ^ Saens to
Cesar Franck	PERSON	is like closing a volnme of
Taine	PERSON	and taking up
Maeterlinck	LOCATION	; shows that the nationality of
Tschaikowsky	ORGANIZATION	's masic proves a priori that , however tinged it may be with personal melancholy , it is not ulti - mately pessimistical or destructive in efiEect -- that he was not simply a neurasthenic
Jeremiah	PERSON	with a faculty for orchestration : and that
Brahms	PERSON	has Homeric simplicity and excels all his contemporaries in soundness and univer - sality , -- when Mr.
Mason	PERSON	makes these things clear to us , we realize at once that he is master of his subject .

		A closing essay on the meaning of music seeks to suggest that still larger en - vironment of human feeling and activity on which music , like everything else , depends for its vitality .

		The illustrations consist of por - traits of the composers mentioned .

		Mr.
Philip H. Goepp	PERSON	's second volume on `` Symphonies and their Meaning '' completes the whole survey of classic symphonies .

		The first volume aimed to unravel the mystery of symphonies , -- `` to see what tonal meaning really mean ^ .

		and , quite as clearly , what it does not mean . ''

		The present work seeks to test the bidden truths in other classic symphonies that varied in their plan and quality , and finally to survey the entire field of the great tonal works of art . ''

		There ia real truth in the STmbolism of the moral strife of individnal , of debate and dispute , drawing truth from the dregs , rising to final enlightenment .

		Every phase of life is here idealized .

		Again , the symbol has real trnth .

		Beauty , strength , each have their figures .

		The moral , not the external , life of man fiinds in music its full play and mirror .

		The true essence of life is in its emotions , and they play in tones as do fish in the waters .

		The highest problems are ethical , emotional , of experience ; science is but a lesser helpmeet .

		In music their utterance is so real that they seem to be them - selves in the life of the tonal stream .

		Given the type of pleading , of defiance , of plaint , of prayerful trust , of triumphant joy , -- given all these , together with the full play of dispute and strife , and you have all the re - soarces , unconscious and therefore the more genuine and convincing , for the utterance of man 's most vital thought .

		So you have in the
Fifth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	actually as stirring a refrain of the same high truth as in the book of Job . ''

		These two volumes by Mr.
Goepp	PERSON	are to be numbered among the classic works on music .

		Mozart ,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	LOCATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Brahms	PERSON	, and others , are here treated more lengthily than in any previous work .

		The au - thor has , with good discrimination and evidence of wide experience , chosen from the works of composers characteristic selections illustrative of the explanations given .

		Xone of the treatises on this particular branch of musical aesthetics DOW extant add much to the understanding of the subject , and the reason is that the writers have hitherto begun at the wrong end , whereas the present writer , by a judicious selection of art forms and rare analytical ability , has given us a comprehensive book of special value to all who look upon music as worthy of deep and serious thought . ''

		Every bit of music has a home where it begins and where it ends , every melodic figure has its own nook and niche , and every idea of whatever symbolic guise has its own tonal vine and fig-tree . ''

		Whether de - scribing the bounds of tonal art in the '' Pas - toral '' of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, or that literal story of an artist 's woes ,
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	's '' Fantastic Symphony , '' or
Kichard Strauss	PERSON	'
Ein Seldenleben	PERSON	, the au - thor holds his subject well in hand .

		He has produced a concise yet comprehensive history of a subject deeply interesting to musicians , if not to the general public .

		The average young American woman who dreams of cultivating her voice by taking a few lessons a week for a term or two at a mnsio - school might well heed the account given by
Bontempi	PERSON	of the training given to pupils at the papal chapel about the middle of the seven - teenth century .

		One hour a day was devoted to the singing of difficult passages , a second to the practice of the thrill , a third to pure intona - tion , -- all in the presence of the teacher , and with the help of a mirror , to avoid grimaces and observe the motion of the tongue and mouth > Besides these , several hours were devoted to the study of expression , several more to practice on the piano , composition , and the theory of music ; and frequent opportunity was given to sing in church , while the
Monte Mario	ORGANIZATION	was visited in order that the pupils might hear the echo of their voices and thereby study their own faults .

		In a monograph entitled '' How to Sing ''
Madame Lilli Lehmann	PERSON	indicates the difficulties which result from the hurried cultivation of the voice .

		She points out that in former times eight years were devoted to the study of singing , -- at the
Prague	LOCATION	Conser - vatory , for instance , -- before a pupil became proficient .

		To-day artists are turned out in '' factories , '' that is , in so-called conservatories , or by teachers who give lessons ten or twelve hours a day . ''

		In two years they receive a cer - tificate of competence , or at least the diploma of the ' factory . '

		The latter I consider a crime that the state should prohibit . ''

		She adds that 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, not until artists reach the point where they can take council with each other about their mis - takes and deficiencies , and discuss the means for overcomiug them , will bad singing and in - artistic effort be checked and the art of singing come into its '' rights '' again .

		The author has been on the stage since her eighteenth year , -- that is , for thirty-four years , -- appearing as a star in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		For many years she has been devoting herself to the important questions relating to singing ; and in the work before us she has given us the result of her researches . ''

		It has been my endeavor to set down as clearly as possible all that I have learned through zealous , conscientious study by myself and with others , and thereby to offer to my colleagues something that will bring order into the chaos of their methods of singing ; something based on science as well as on sensations in singing ; something that will bring expressions often misunderstood into clear relation with the exact func - tions of the vocal organs . ''

		The various chapters in her work are devoted to such subjects as the singer 's physiological studies , nasal singing , position of the tongue , the sensation of the resonance of the head cavi - ties , development and equalization , the tremolo , and practical exercises .

		Numerous plates are interspersed throughout the work , and are so drawn as to be of sufficient aid to vocal aspirants as to make her treatise a suitable text for the use of conservatories and teachers .

		`` Reminiscences -- Musical and Otherwise , '' by Miss
Fanny Reed	ORGANIZATION	, is devoted chiefly to recol - lections of celebrities with whom the author has been intimately acquainted , including Liszt ,
Paul Deschanel	PERSON	,
Madeline Lemaire	PERSON	,
Coquelin	LOCATION	,
Massenet	ORGANIZATION	, and
Paderewski	ORGANIZATION	.

		As she says , her '' stream of chance '' seems to have flowed in an unusual course , and , carrying her beyond the prosaic existence of many
New England	LOCATION	girls , brought her into the delightful salons of the Old World , whose presiding spirits are beacon - lights in music , literature , and art .

		When we consider
Miss Reed	ORGANIZATION	's ability , we can not help adding that these sketches are a trifle too lau - datory .

		True , she has sketched her subjects as she has known them ; but we miss that intersprinkling of criticism which serves to illu - minate any record of events and give it pro- portion .

		Is it not frequently the case that in books such as this , when handled by able critics , it is too often laid down as a general prin - ciple that the legitimate use of comparisons stops at illustration and characterization ?

		It is as a racy , gossipy book for the general reader that
Miss Reed	ORGANIZATION	's work will be appreciated .

		The reproductions of autographed photographs make attractive illustrations . ''

		The nineteenth century was the period of achieve - ment ; there is every reason to believe that the twentieth century will be the period of still nobler ac - chievement ... During the era we are entering no unworthy teacher will be permitted to trifle with the unfolding musical instincts of childhood .

		The study of music will take an honored place in the curriculum of every school , academy , college , and university , as an essential factor in culture . ''

		Such is the prefatory note to a series of prac - tical essays on music , entitled '' For Every Music Lover , '' by Mrs.
Aubertine Woodward Moore	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Auber	PERSON	Forestier '' -RRB- .

		The author is a scholarly pianist , and a practitioner as well as a theorist .

		She is well known as a pioneer in the field of illustrated talks on music , and these essays , which have not previously appeared in print , are composed , to a large extent , of ma - terials used by the author in her public and private lectures on the history and theory of music .

		An idea of the scope of her work may be gleaned from the title chapters : '' The Origin and Function of Music , '' '' Blunders in Music Study , '' `` The Musical Education that Educates , '' '' How to Interpret Music , '' '' How to Listen to Music , '' `` The Poetry and Lead - ership of Chopin , '' `` Violins and Violinists -- Fact and Fable , '' `` Queens of Song , '' `` The Opera and its Reformers , '' `` Famous Orato - rios , '' and '' Symphony and Symphonic Poem . ''

		The knowledge of technique and mature judg - ment displayed in the volume promises to bring to it the success enjoyed by the author 's pre - vious work published
two years ago	DATE	, which tended to show how music may gain its rightful place as a beneficent influence in daily life .

		Needless to say , Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	is eminently fitted to treat her subject with authority .

		In a prefatory note to '' The Story of Ora - torio '' Miss
Annie W. Patterson	PERSON	points out that if the average '' musical man '' is asked what an oratorio is , he will reply : '' Oh , the Messiah is an oratorio .

		It is a great work , you know -- for chorus , band , and big singers -- and we hear it at least once a year -- generally about Christ - mas time '' ; and the definition ends .

		Of all musical forms , the oratorio has the distinction of being the noblest and most ennobling .

		Miss
Patterson	PERSON	has endeavored to write a connected narrative touching upon all the phases in the history of this particular form of musical art , -- from its first dawn in the music of religious devotion to its climax in the masterpieces of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	and
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, -- yet free from dry statistics , unnecessary detail , and parenthetical

		THE DIAL 153 information .

		The namber of works classed un - der the heading of oratorio is very mislead - intr --
Schomann	PERSON	's profane oratorio , `` Paradise and the Peri , '' ' is pointed out as an unique ex - ample ; therefore , only those works the texts of which were drawn from biblical narrative or episode are included in the present treatise .

		The `` Messiah , '' `` Creation , '' and `` Redemp - tion '' are not included in the same category as such famous masses as the '' Lobgesang '' of Mendelssohn and the '' Deutsches Requiem '' of
Brahms	PERSON	.

		Miss
Patterson	PERSON	's style of narration , while not brilliant , is clear and forcible .

		Her most conspicuous fault is , perhaps , a too favor - able estimate of mediocrity .

		The last two chap - ters in the book are addressed especially to professional musical students .

		^ ^ ^ jjjg faculty of provoking dissent , his views on practically all political topics being held with an uncompromising vigor and consistency .

		As an open advocate of the once forgotten tenets enanciated by
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, he is one of the foremost promulgators in .

		the public life of
America	LOCATION	to-day of dostrines and tendencies holding with the practical politicians of the Old World rather than with the theorists and idealists of the New .

		He is therefore held to stand with the con - servative side of our national life , though his teach - ings are in most respects radical in the extreme when contrasted with the principles on which our government was founded .

		But he is always provo - cative of thought , and in nothing he has written more than in ' • A Fighting Frigate , and Other Essays and Addresses '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , containing in a single volume the work already given to the public in the form of magazine articles or public speeches on formal occasions , written or delivered within the last five years .

		Necessarily the subjects are all congenial ones , and contain a practical exposition of Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's political and ethical philosophy .

		In the address from which the book borrows its name , given at the celebration of the return of the old '' Constitution '' to the
navy	ORGANIZATION	yard at
Charlestown	LOCATION	in
1897	DATE	, may be read this characteristic statement , for example : '' The Tirtaes tenned ' a ^ Tage ' I take to be the early and primary ones of courage , indiffeienee to danger , and loyalty to the tribes or clans which , in the prowmi of time , became nationa and eonntrieo ... The gentler rirtaes , as well as the lefinementa and graces of cirilization , rest npon these simpler qoalities ; and the highest achieTements of the race in the arts of peace hare come from the strong , bold nations of the earth .

		Art ,
Uteratare	LOCATION	, philosophy , invention , in
Graeee	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, in
Venice	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	, all reached their aeaith when those countries were at the height of their military and political power , and sank as that power decayed . ''

		Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	does not mention the fact , but it would be doubtful whether such ■ ' strong , bold nations '' as the Tartars and Turks , the Spaniards , or even the earlier Scythians and Gaols , can be set in sneeeM - ful contrast with the ideals of civilization emM | riBg from
Palestine	LOCATION	and
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	when neither of those countries could by any trick of speech be exalted into '' strong , bold nations '' in Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's sense of the words .

		Nor does he seem to be in accord with the teachings of evolution in regard to the higher value of intellect and morality as distin - guished from his approved ' • savage virtues '' ; and he certainly does not make the point that decadence follows upon the attainment of '' military and polit - ical power '' of necessity , while national righteous - ness has been a conservator of national energy , and has enabled the effort wasted in war to manifest itself in peace .

		One wonders , also , how he can reconcile the Anglo-Saxon supremacy which he holds in such high estimation with the lower position taken by nations that have turned themselves into armed camps .

		The rest of the book is given up to extolling the great Federalists of the earlier days of the republic ,
John Marshall	PERSON	,
Oliver Ellsworth	PERSON	, and

		There is scholarship and vigor in these essays and addresses , but there is little Christianity , so far as ideals are concerned .

		PcrUt Paradite .

		There is but one
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is neither a seaport nor a centre of commerce .

		Its location has always been far enough inland to allow it to develop its own resources and characteristics unimpeded by the forces that inevitably encroach on the individuality of seaport cities .

		No one can understand or prop - erly estimate such a unique metropolis who has not lived with it through several seasons .

		Mr.
Henry Haynie	PERSON	's two volimnes on ''
Paris	LOCATION	, Past and Present '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- are the result of long and intimate ao - quaintanee with
Paris	LOCATION	and the Parisian .

		Twenty years of sojourning within her fortifications gave him more than he could find in books and libraries .

		With evident enthusiasm for his task , and a desire to pack as much information as possible between the lids of these volumes , he has gone into the his - tory of the city from the time the Romans en - camped on the '' De de la Cite '' down to the pres - ent .

		Naturally , there had to be severe condensation in every part ; and this fact makes the reading of Uiose chapters that deal with the city 's history very fragmentary and unsatisfactory .

		But this deficiency 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, is relieved as soon as the author sets about describing the great institutions of to-day .

		Each of these is traced in its historical connections , and in its pres - ent position in political , religious , or educational
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is apparent from the start that we are to have a roseate picture painted by an adorer of the French capital .

		While recognizing that there are in it things to be censured , the author 's admirable method of sketching and coloring very greatly min - imizes that fact .

		He describes with ample detail , and in plain and lucid language , public buildings , parks , monuments , educational institutions , the govern - ment , and even the sewer system .

		His admiration for the city , and his inability to render a harsh judg - ment , may be seen in the following statement : '' In all things and in everything ,
Paris	LOCATION	is most beautiful , most lovely , most adorable , most intelligent .

		... In all that relates to intellectual , industrial , and social life , the preeminence of
Paris	LOCATION	is incontestible , and uncontested '' -LRB- vol .

		II. , p. 236 -RRB- .

		The author 's pains - taking description of the most notable institutions of the city is beautifully supplemented by twenty-four photogravures and thirty-two half-tones in the text .

		One or two good maps would add to the interest and value of the book .

		`` The Blood of the Nation , '' by Z ' ^ ^ .

		` j ^ dZ ' .

		President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, is a small book published by the Amer - ican
Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Small it is , but weighty , for its contents form one of the most impressive ser - mons ever preached against militarism .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	writes of the wickedness of warfare from the standpoint of the Christian moralist , it is true , but his argument does not waste itself in the usual abstractions , for it is reinforced by the message of science , for which the author is an accredited spokesman . ''

		The blood of a nation determines its history '' and '' The history of a nation determines its blood . ''

		These are the two main propositions of the book , but it is to the second of them , because the less obvious of the two , that attention is chiefly directed .

		The lesson is drawn from the history of the military peoples in both ancient and modern times that a nation becomes irredeemably weak - ened that sends forth its best to die on the battle - field .

		The next generation is made up of the descendants of the weaklings who have not been fit to fight .

		This is a simple enough lesson , and demonstrably true , but the world stubbornly re - fuses to recognize it , and most countries continue in their insane exaltation of the military spirit and the tinsel glory that comes from warfare .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	quotes from the poets to excellent effect , although we can not account for his calling Oscar Wilde 's '' Ave Imperatrix '' '' the last flicker of dy - ing genius in his wretched life , '' or for his saying that `` in the late war some poet , addressing the spirit of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, appealed to her , -- ' of all thy thousands grant us three To make a new Ther - mopylw . ' ''

		The poet was
Byron	PERSON	-LRB- who is misquoted -RRB- , and the '' late war '' was that of the early nineteenth Japanese curios and cobwebs .

		century .

		-- Another little book by Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	, pub - lished by
Messrs. Elder & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	, is called '' The Philosophy of Despair . ''

		Taking
FitzGerald	PERSON	's Omar for his text , the author proceeds to '' indicate some part of the answer of Science to the Philosophy of Despair . ''

		But he is no optimist of the shallow sort , and does not blink the very real problem , or seek to glaze it over by comforting platitudes .

		He takes what we believe to be the only possible stand against philosophical pessimism when he deals with it as a matter of temperament rather than of logic , and insists that healthful activity is in itself happi - ness , and not a process whereby happiness is to be attained in some future time . ''

		Such an expression as ' worth living ' kas in fact no real meaning .

		To act and to love are the twin functions of the human body and soul .

		To live effectively implies the belief that life is worth living , and no one who leads a worthy life has ever for a moment doubted this . ''

		This last sentence may possibly make too sweeping a claim , but we have much sympathy for the gen - eral tenor of Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	's thought , and believe that his little book is of the most helpful kind -- espe - cially to young men and women who are passing through the early stages of the inevitable disillu - sionment that comes somewhere between childhood and maturity .

		The curious and filmy character of Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's new book called '' Kotto '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ac - cords well with its more descriptive sub - title , '' Japanese Curios and Cobwebs , '' and with the ap - propriate and artistic illustrations by
Genjiro Eto	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first nine tales , '' only curios , '' are selections from several old Japanese books , '' to illustrate some strange beliefs , '' the chief of which seems to be transmigration of souls .

		A very interesting chap - ter is the one entitled '' A Woman 's Diary , '' which might be called the Japanese version of '' The Con - fessions of a Wife . ''

		Several of the `` Cobwebs '' are very dry and dusty ; indeed , the book as a whole is hardly up to the author 's standard , -- or possibly we miss the freshness and novelty of our first im - pressions of this charming writer .

		One of the most interesting portions of the book is that devoted to '' Fireflies . ''

		It is wrought out from a Japanese work by Prof.
S. Watase	PERSON	, formerly of the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	and Wood 's HoU , and now of the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	at
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		The Japanese original discusses the subject from a scientific as well as a popular point of view ; but Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	confines himself to the latter , with numerous illus - trations from Japanese folk-lore and poetic litera - ture .

		In olden days , poverty-stricken students in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	used to be compelled to learn their lessons by the fitful flame of fifty fireflies im - prisoned in a small bamboo cage .

		Even now , `` many persons in
Japan	LOCATION	earn their living during the sum - mer months by catching and selling fireflies ; indeed , the extent of this business entitles it to be regarded as a special industry . ''

		The Chief Executive of the nation ■ Omrgrma ^ has declared that the preservation of '' '' ' *** ^ '' '' ' our forests and the conservation of our water-supplies constitute the most serious inter - nal problems confronting our country .

		Readers of Professor
Fernow	PERSON	's ' • Economics of Forestry , '' a recent volume in the '' Library of Economics and Politics '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , will appreciate the seriousness of the problems which is hastening upon us with the destruction of our most valuable forests by the axe and fire , and consequent permanent deforestation of considerable areas .

		The large consumption , the wasteful methods , and the general lack of effort on the part of the lumbering interests to conserve the supply or to provide for the replacement of the for - ests , not only threaten us with a wood-famine , but they have already brought to light , even in
Wiscon	LOCATION	- sin , the possibilities of a desert arising where in the memory of man the forest once throve .

		The book is replete with facts that show , on the other hand , the possibilities of scientific treatment of the problem in the conservation and maintenance of existing sup - plies , the economic utilization of the product , and the reforestation with valuable timber of areas now abandoned to the chances of nature .

		The book ought to be .

		in the hands of every legislator in the land , and public-spirited men who wish to inform themselves authoritatively on the gravity of the problem and the needs and possibilities of pertinent legislation will find here the trustworthy informa - tion needed , as well as inspiration for formulating a public policy .

		The author styles it a reference - book for students of political economy , and profes - sional and lay students of forestry .

		It is all this , and more .

		It is a most cogent argument for an efficient grappling with the situation by scientific methods that shall save for the nation the remnant of its magnificent endowment of forests .

		The work has been begun ; the time is opportune for its ad - vancement by state and national legislation , and by corporate or individual utilization of the facilities now offered by the
Bureau of Forestry	ORGANIZATION	at Wash - ington for scientific direction in the managment of woodlands .

		The Rev.

		Without wife or chil - dren , he paid to the school a devotion that brooked no rival claims ; and the success and honor that came to him in his chosen career were his sufficient reward .

		The details of his original methods in the classroom , where he is described by one of his pu - pils as an '' enchanter , '' and the delineation of those characteristics that give him such a hold on boys in their play as well as in their work , furnish ' most in - teresting reading . ''

		Boys ought hardly ever to be punished against their will , '' was his golden rule of discipline ; and his practice was to get the offender to name his own punishment .

		Yet he was a strict and remarkably successful disciplinarian .

		The old method of language-teaching by grammar he un - ceremoniously threw out of the window .

		He was in favor of `` cribs , '' in the interest of more rapid progress and also of honesty and fairness . ''


Bohn	PERSON	is too much for us , '' he declared ; and yet when he failed to persuade his colleagues to countenance translations , he achieved a wonderful degree of suc - cess in banishing and keeping out the intrusive
Bohn	PERSON	.

		To his love of and proficiency in athletics he owed much of his singular influence over boys .

		He also wrote their school songs for them , in a rollicking vein that is irresistible .

		Many of these songs , and other poems from his pen , as well as some of his educational essays , are given in an appendix .

		*** ' 7 ° ^ ^ ° '' ^
Carolina	LOCATION	, the Presi - dent of the
Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	of that
State	ORGANIZATION	has concluded a noble work -LRB-
McCrady	ORGANIZATION	's ``
South Carolina	LOCATION	in the Revolution , ''
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This fourth volume covers the period 1780-1783 .

		The same painstaking research that has produced the former volumes is evident here also .

		It is a very exact presentation of the military history of the period .

		When this has been said , the limitations of the work are indicated .

		The civil history of
the State	ORGANIZATION	is almost ignored .

		The movement of public opinion as to the merits of the Revolutionary War , either in the
State	ORGANIZATION	at large or as indicated in gov - erning circles , is left to one side , -- and this in a
State	ORGANIZATION	where the conflict of opinion was of eritieal importance .

		The persistent attempt throughout the volume to disparage General
Greene	PERSON	, both as a sol - dier and as a man , is also a blemish on its pag ^ .

		There is no doubt that
General Sumter	ORGANIZATION	and other State leaders have not hitherto been given due credit ; but it is not necessary to accumulate ob - loquy upon
Gteneral Greene	PERSON	's head to accomplish that end .

		OnUide of these features , the work is critical and inclusive , and may stand as a master - piece of research for other State historians .

		Afield with The number of sportsmen who seek trophies in the fields and woods with the camera is rapidly increasing .

		One of the most successful of them has given to the public a full account of his methods , and evidences of his good luck -- or .

		rather , his skill ; for with the camera , even more than with the gun , patience , coolness , good judgment , and above all persistency , are necessary in every successful stalk .

		Mr.
A. Radclyffe Dugmore	PERSON	, in his '' Nature and the 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	'' Camera '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , has confided to his readers the details of his procedure in photographing live birds and their nests ; animals , wild and tame ; reptiles , insects , fish and other aquatic forms ; and flowers , trees , and fungi .

		The suggestions as to the outfit necessary for each subject are explicit , and the methods of overcoming difficulties which one meets in the field , in approaching the wary wild folk with the camera , are illustrated from the author 's sxperience .

		The book is richly illustrated with very artistic and instructive pictures selected from the author 's collection of over three thousand negatives .

		How much better this sounds than three thousand bird-skins !

		The book is eminently prac - tical , and the hints and helps for the amateur , with which it abounds , together with the inspiration which the results presented by the author afford , should do much to advance this fascinating sport among nature-lovers .

		The work can not fail to promote interest in the wild life of our fields and forests , and in time , let us hope , may lead to some cessation of the senseless and wanton killing of our native birds and beasts .

		There is in it also much promise for the development and enrichment of our decora - tive arts , as not a few of Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	's pictures bear witness .

		A guide to tho ^ iss
Julia Ellen Rogers	PERSON	, author of ttudyofour `` Among Green Trees '' -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	: common tree , .

		^ ^ Mumford -RRB- , does not think that a popular book about trees should describe all those that grow , say in
North-Eastern America	LOCATION	, and then expect the bewildered beginner to be able to tell them apart ; and because she knows of no '' all-around tree-book '' she has written the present one .

		It is in four parts , only one of which , called '' Outdoor Studies with Trees , '' bears directly upon the matter of identification .

		This deals with such facts as one may learn , if he is interested and ob - servant , from the trees themselves , without any reference to books .

		Part II .

		discusses '' The Life of Trees , '' that is , the physiological side of the study ; Part III. , the practical matter of tree cul - ture ; and finally Part IV .

		describes '' The Kinds of Trees , '' limited to the common species that grow in the
United States	LOCATION	, north of
Virginia	LOCATION	and east of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are about twenty-five full-page illustrations , picturing complete and beautiful speci - mens of our native trees .

		Countless detailed draw - ings and photographs supplementary to these very beautiful larger ones , furnish accurate data about bark , buds , leaves , flowers , fruit , seeds , etc. .


Ama	ORGANIZATION	- teurs interested in forestry will find Miss
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's book an excellent guide .

		Mr.
Charles Gordon	PERSON	's elaborately illustrated work on `` The Old Bai - ley and
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Pott -RRB- furnishes rather grim and ghastly entertainment .

		Stow ,
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Holinshed	LOCATION	,
Howell	PERSON	, the letter-books of the
Corpo	PERSON	- ration of the City of
London	LOCATION	, and many obscurer sources of information , have been ransacked with fruitful results , while old prints have been gener - A calendar ojcrvme .

		ously drawn upon to contribute whatever elements of a blood-curdling , hair-raising nature may be lacking in the text .

		But we must not convey a false impression .

		The book , though devoted largely to the careers of noted criminals and the penal horrors visited upon them , contains much curious informa - tion of a less forbidding nature ; and many of the illustrations are of historical interest and wholly free from repulsive features .

		Appropriate mention , too , is made of the labors of
John Howard	PERSON	,
Elizabeth Frye	PERSON	, and other prison-reformers .

		It would have been well if the author had made clear at the outset what is meant by `` the Old
Bailey	PERSON	. ''

		After stating that it takes its name from the hallium , or old wall running between
Ludgate	ORGANIZATION	and
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	, he passes on to the history of
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	prison .

		Old
Bailey	PERSON	is the name given both to the street occu - pying the site of the ancient wall , and also to the criminal court fronting on that street and adjoining the prison .

		But the old prison is now no more , its demolition having begun on the
15th of last August	DATE	.

		It would be an interesting thing to `` ulr fr ` Tperr , ' ^ ' '' '' ^ ~ ' ^ ° ° ^ '' '' '' '' ^ ' '' '' * '' ' ^ ' ^ ^ ^ place
John Brown	PERSON	will have in Amer - ican history a hundred years from now .

		Perhaps an equally curious thing to know would be
John Brown	PERSON	's place now , had not certain forces North and South conspired to make a martyr of him in
1859	DATE	.

		Opinions will doubtless continue for some time to differ as to
Brown	PERSON	's merits and his place in history .

		The savage attack made upon him by Professor
Burgess	PERSON	in his recently published book on '' The Civil War and the Constitution '' will justify those who think very differently in writing sympathetic ac - counts of his life .

		Such a work is Mr.
John Newton	PERSON	's '' Captain
John Brown	PERSON	of
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- , a book of three hundred pages , which gives the im - pressions of an ardent admirer , but does not furnish any new material .

		It simply tells again of the con - ditions which made
John Brown	PERSON	possible , of the ideas which dominated him , and of the attempts he made to translate these ideas into accomplished facts .

Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's Notebooks '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- , edited by his daughter the Hon. Mrs.
Wodehouse	PERSON	, offer us an interesting and intimate revelation of
Arnold	LOCATION	's intel - lectual habits .

		For nearly forty years , he kept diaries for his official engagements , and in these diaries he entered , from day to day , passages in his reading that particularly impressed him .

		The passages are brief , and include texts in
Greek	LOCATION	,
Latin	LOCATION	, French , German , Italian , and English .

		Many of them are of a religious character , and nearly all bear in some way on the con - duct of life .

		Mrs.
Wodehouse	PERSON	has reprinted this matter verbatim for every fifth year of the note books .

		The result is so interesting that we could wish they had been reprinted entire .

		The sources are sometimes in - dicated , but in a majority of the cases we are left in the dark concerning the origin of the quoted passage .

		In order to do this adequately he gives first a most suggestive survey of the beginnings of English poetry ; and then , after an elaborate treatment of the sonnet writers from
Surrey	LOCATION	to
Shakspere	LOCATION	, he takes up in detail the study of the man ,
William Shakspere	PERSON	, the social life which surrounded him , and his mental and spirit - ual evolution as shown by the growth of his art .

		From the existing evidence , and the '' relation of man to his fellow man '' in the various plays , Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	constructs a probable sequence and grouping of the great master 's work which bears largely upon its face the story of the man 's own life struggle and mighty conquest of himself .

		Much of the best prose work Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	left is contained in these two volumes .

		NOTES 214 THE AUTHOR OF '' JOHN INGLES ANT . ''

		The name of the late Mr.
Shorthouse	PERSON	ap - pears upon the title-pages of half a dozen books , but nine persons out of ten to whom his name means anything at all know him only as the author of `` John Inglesant . '' '

		The very titles of the later and slighter books have faded from the memory , but the solitary masterpiece given to the world by an absolutely unknown writer twenty-two years ago remains in the re - collection of those who have read it , not as a name only , but as a collection of pictures and vivid impressions of the sort that become a permanent possession .

		There are many among those readers , no doubt , who have forgotten - the author 's name , there may be those who have forgotten the name of his titular hero ; but even these can hardly have forgotten the account of the papal conclave and the plague at
Naples	LOCATION	, the Molinist philosophy of quietism , the sym - pathetic study of the English Cavalier , and the intimate revelation of life in seventeenth cen - tury
Italy	LOCATION	.

		We may have read many other works of fiction since , and the outline of ''
John	PERSON	■ Inglesant '' may have grown dim in the retro - spect , but its brilliancy and its spiritual con - tent remain with us , and we never grow doubt - ful of its right to be held a part of English lit - erature .

		``
Joseph Henry Shorthouse	PERSON	, manufacturer of sulphuric acid , etc. ,
Birmingham	LOCATION	. ''

		This , with a list of titles , and a statement that his - favorite recreation is found in '' books , '' ig the information provided by '' Who 's Who . '

		* ^ Neither the name nor the place nor the ooca - pation is particularly suggestive of literature .

		So we might read in some similar handbook of
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	that he was a gauger at the
Boston	LOCATION	custom house , surveyor of the port of Salem , and
United States	LOCATION	consul atr Liverpool .

		These things do not seem to agree with '' The Scarlet Letter '' any more than
Birmingham	LOCATION	and sulphuric acid seem to agree with ``
John Inglesant	PERSON	. ''

		The moral appears to be that the free spirit of man will find self - expression under no matter how adverse an en - vironment .

		We have brought
Hawthorne	PERSON	into this discussion with deliberate intention , for
Shorthouse	PERSON	recognized him as the supreme master in the species of composition to which ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	'' belongs -- '' the philosoph - ical romance . ''

		His tribute is paid in the fol - lowing words : '' There will at once occur to the reader 's mind numerous works of fiction of the highest talent , where philosophical ideas have been introduced with surpassing effect .

		By
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	this art was carried to such perfection that it is only with difficulty that we perceive how absolutely every character ^ 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, nay , every word and line , is subordinated to the philosophical idea of the book . ''

		When `` John Inglesant '' came to a second edition , the author took occasion to prepare a prefatory statement of his aim in writing it .

		Philosophy in the guise of fiction was what of deliberate purpose he offered his readers , and this called for a method of treatment quite dif - ferent from that employed by novelists of the ordinary sort . ''

		In books where fiction is only used to introduce philosophy , I believe that it is not to be expected that human life is to be described simply as such .

		The characters are , so to speak , sublimated : they are only intro - duced for a set purpose , and having fulfilled this purpose , -- were it only to speak a dozen ■ words -- they vanish from the stage .

		Nor is this so unlike real life as may at first appear .

		Human life , as revealed to most of us , does not group itself in stage effect , does not arrange itself in elaborate plot ; and brilliant dialogue declares the glory of the author more fre - quently than it increases reality of effect .

		If fiction , therefore , is allowed to select and to condense from life , surely philosophy may do so too . ''

		Concerning this declaration of guiding principle we are constrained to say that the au - thor did not altogether live up to it , for ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	'' is far from being the abstract pro- duction that he would have us believe .

		It has no small degree of warmth , and color , and dramatic effectiveness , and just because it is possessed of these qualities it is a better book than it would have been had Mr.
Shortbouse	PERSON	held fast to the logic of his doctrinaire phi - losophy of fiction .

		`` John Inglesant '' is a historical novel in the sense that it introduces the figures of men who have played real parts in history , and that its scene is set in a definite historical period .

		But it is very unlike the novel that is ordinarily styled historical , because it penetrates so much farther beneath the surface of life .

		The fault of the common historical novel is , as Mr.
Short	PERSON	- house suggests , that the romance outweighs the history ; and it is a further fault that what his - tory is vouchsafed us concerns only the trap - pings and the suits of the period , leaving its spirit nnrevealed . ''

		All that is wanted , '' he tells us , '' to constitute a historical romance of the highest interest is the recovery of the de - tailed incidents of everyday life , and the awaken - ing of the individual need and striving , long since quiet in the grave . ''

		This is the sort of historical romance that we find in '' John In - glesant , '' a story of the spiritual life essentially , a story that we instinctively classify , because we find it in some way comparable , with such diverse masterpieces as ''
IPromessi Sposi	PERSON	, '' and ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	, '' and '' La Chartreuse de Parme , '' and '' The Cloister and the Hearth . ''

		To name a more recent analogue , we might mention Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's '' The Valley of De - cision . ''

		We do not read these books , nor do we read ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	, '' primarily for the story that is told ; we read them rather because they interpret for us the modes of thought and the spiritual currents of other times and places .

		They are studies in the history of culture rather than pleasant imaginings about private in - dividuals .

		It is such books as these that redeem fiction from the reproach of catering to the mere enter - tainment of the reader , and that justify it as the typical form of modern literary art .

		Fiction has much to answer for , no doubt , in the way of sensationalism , and pettiness , and morbid imagination , and false idealism .

		But a book like ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	'' shows that the writing of novels may be also one of the noblest forms of artistic and ethical endeavor .

		And the high mission of the serious novelist has not often found as fine an exemplification as in this very book , or as beautiful a statement as in this reply of the author to the sneer implied in the words : '' It is only a romance . '' ''

		True .

		It is only human life in the ' highways and hedges , ' and in ' the streets and lanes of the city , ' with the ceaseless throbbing of its quivering heart ; it is only daily life from the workshop , from the court , from the market , and from the stage ; it is only kindliness and neighborhood and child-life , and the fresh wind of heaven , and the waste of sea and forest , and the sunbreak upon the starless peaks , and contempt of wrong and pain and death , and the passionate yearn - ing for the face of God , and woman 's tears , and woman 's self-sacrifice and devotion , and woman 's love .

		Yes , it is only a romance .

		It is only the ivory gates falling back at the fairy touch .

		It is only the leaden sky breaking for a moment above the bowed and weary head , revealing the fathomless Infinite through the gloom .

		It is only a romance . ''

		Those who have come under the spell of this masterpiece of philosophical and historical fic - tion will doubtless wish to know the other work of Mr.
Shorthouse	PERSON	.

		There are five volumes of these minor writings .

		`` The Little Schoolmaster Mark , '' ''
Sir Percival	PERSON	, '' '' Countess Eve , '' '' A Teacher of the Violin , and Other Tales , '' and '' Blanche , Lady Falaise . ''

		The note of spir -
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		189 itnality is dominant in them all , and tends to become so refined as to escape from ordinary human limitations .

		This is particularly true in the case of '' Sir
Percival	PERSON	, '' which teaches how , even under the conditions of modern life , the quest of the Grail may still be pursued .

		But these books are trifles in comparison with ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	. ''

		Of that masterpiece we are glad to note the stately three-volume edition which has just been published , and which gives a worthy setting to its contents .

		It remains to be said that Mr.
Shorthonse	PERSON	was born in
1834	DATE	, and was thus in his sixty-ninth year at the time of his death .

		OUTLINE OF LINCOLN LITERATURE .

		The recent appear & uce of
Nicolay	PERSON	's `` Short Life of Abraham Lincoln . ''

		-- the more purely biog - raphical portion of ^ icolay and Hay 's great work , ``
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, a History . ''

		-- fitly completes , to date , the tale of immense Lineolniana already in print , and suggests an inquiry into the rise and progress of this remarkable literature .

		For its very beginnings we need to go back only a little more than forty years .

		In an oration delivered before the Society of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, in
October , 1899	DATE	, by Major
Lambert	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and subsequently printed , the following interesting bit of Lincoln chronology is established : ' ■ In a book published in
New York	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	.

		entitled ■ Presidential Candidates , ' contain - ing sketches of prominent candidates for the Pres - idency in
1860	DATE	, sketches are given of twenty-one distinguished men ; in another , entitled * Oar Living Representative Men , ' published in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	.

		thirty-four memoirs are given ; in neither of these books is
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	named , except in - cidentally in one of the sketches of
Douglas	LOCATION	, where allusion is made to the defeat of the former . ''

		Of these fifty-five formerly distinguished names , by far the larger number lie impacted in dictionaries which record a brief digest of their respective pub - lic careers ; while the obscure individual so casually mentioned in connection with the great men of his day , and who before long was to do things un - dreamed of , comes to figure , some forty years later , as the subject of one of the fullest personal biblio - g ^ phies known .

		The earliest collection of
Lineolniana	ORGANIZATION	is probably that of Mr.
William V. Spencer	PERSON	, who published at
Boston	LOCATION	, in
1865	DATE	.

		a quarto volume of some 350 pages of sermons , eulogies , letters , and publications on Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's death .

		Following this , the next year , came the work of the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	scholar and bibliographer ,
John Russell Bartlett	PERSON	, with his '' Lit - erature of the Rebellion : a Catalogue of Books and Pamphlets Relating to the Civil War in the
U. &	ORGANIZATION	, and on Subjects Growing out of that Event , To - gether with Works on
American Slavery	ORGANIZATION	, and Essays and Reviews from Magazines on the same Subject . ''

		In this collection there are 81 title-entries relating to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, comprising a few of his own speeches , mes - sages , and debates ; a meagre record of his public life and policy ; those of the early biographies which had come to the compiler 's notice ; a group of pro- ceedings of cities , towns , and public bodies , on the occasion of his death ; and lately , in a separate liat , a catalogue of 300 commemorative eulogies , ser - mons , orations , and poems .

		The next in point of time is the '' Memorial Lincoln Bibliography '' issued by
Andrew Boyd	PERSON	, at
Albany	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, in
1870	DATE	.

		This work is in two diatinet parts .

		The second part is merely a cata - logue of a collection owned by the publisher , consist - ing of prints , medals , handbills , commemorative miscellany of all sorts , such as decorative badges for special occasions , and the like , -- matter of no especial literary interest The first part is the real
Bxbliographia	LOCATION	,
Lineolniana	LOCATION	, being a somewhat an - notated bibliography of the literature of the collec - tion , -- eulogies , orations , etc. .

		set forth with fitting introduction by the compiler , Mr.
Charles Henry Hart	PERSON	.

		In
Joseph Sabin	PERSON	's monumental '' Dictionary of Books Relating to
America	LOCATION	, '' Volume X. , which contains several pa ^ es of references to works about Lincoln , the title ''
Bibliographia Lineolniana	PERSON	, '' with notes and introduction by
C. H. Hart	PERSON	, has the follow - ing naive comment appended thereto : '' Includes most of the titles contained in
Andrew Boyd	PERSON	's work on the same subject . ''

		The latter has the simple entry , ' > A Memorial Lincoln Bibliography by
Andrew Boyd	PERSON	, '' with nothing to indicate Mr.
Hart	PERSON	's collaboration ; and when the latter 's reprint of his catalogue was published , the mere juxta - position of titles in the
Sabin	PERSON	catalogue did not dis - close their real relationship .

		This early work of Mr.
Hart	PERSON	's , prepared with such care and fulness in gathering material which might otherwise never have been recovered , has contributed to the increased value of the next most comprehensive publication of its kind , '' Lincoln Literature , a Bibliographical Account of Books and Pamphlets Relating to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, Compiled by
Daniel Fish	PERSON	, Member and Secretary Public Li - brary
Board	ORGANIZATION	,
Minneapolis	LOCATION	,
Minn.	LOCATION	; Published by the
Board	ORGANIZATION	,
1900	DATE	. ''

		This is an unbound book of 135 pages , royal octavo , in an attractive paper cover , and contains over 800 full titles , occasionally annotated , of books and pamphlets which have ever appeared as distinct issues .

		An interesting variety of foreign titles appear : In French , 14 ; nearly twice as many in German : a few each of Italian and Spanish ; one Welsh , one Japanese , one Russian , and a translation of a popular life into modern Greek .

		Limiting the effort to separate publications excludes , of course , some of the most valuable material , as many of the best tributes to Lincoln lie embedded in an author 's ' * Complete Works '' ; magazine articles also indexed in ''
Poole	PERSON	'' are not referred to .

		But these excln - 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, sions do not rob this work of its chief distinction , which lies in the volume and variety of writings about a man unknown to fame six years before his death , and who was never known in public life aside from one great question .

		What manner of man was this to evoke a literature so copious , so universal , and finally so unanimous ?

		For one of the obvious char - acteristics of the collection is the meagre record left upon its pages of the violently hostile criticism be - longing to the early sixties .

		Volumes of it can be found , it is true , in the files of the war-time news - papers .

		But of the bitterly arrogant opinion upon the conduct of the war , with which the atmosphere was charged even at the capital city itself , few traces remain .

		Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	has preserved for as the flavor of much of the usual speech of the day in her book of reminiscences .

		Writing of the com - mon estimate of Lincoln in the autumn of
' 61	DATE	, she says : '' Fev people praised or trnsted him .

		Why did he not do this , or that , or the other ?

		He a President , indeed I Look at this war , dra ^ rging on so slowly !

		Look at our many de - feats and rare victories !

		Such was the talk that one con - stantly heard regarding him .

		The most charitable held that he meant well . ''

		But to return to the obscurity of
1859	DATE	, -- consid - erably less an obscurity in
Illinois	LOCATION	, however , than in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	publishing centres .

		The leading events of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life from '58 to '60 can be picked out and strung on a very small inch of string .

		These were , the defeat for the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
1858	DATE	; the sugges - tion for the Presidency by an
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	editor in
1859	DATE	; the three years of speech-making from 1 858 to
1860	DATE	.

		Upon the untried occasion of the
Cooper Institute	ORGANIZATION	speech , the dean of American letters ,
William Cul	PERSON	-
len Bryant	PERSON	, well within the limits of a conservative truthfulness , introduced the speaker as '' an eminent citizen of the West , hitherto known to yon only by reputation . ''

		With
1860	DATE	, however , and the accepted fact of Lin - coln 's candidacy for the office of President , a num - ber of impromptu biographies scrambled into print .

		Most of these were campaign documents , written chiefly by newspaper men of experience , and not without merit in their brief fidelity to fact .

		For
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's public career had offered so little , aside from his one term of service in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and his speech-making on a single theme , that the original material was easily mastered , his simple record pre - senting none of the stumbling-blocks in the path of one whose task it is to write of a long and sometimes wavering political career .

		These early biographies were usually duodecimos in the ordinary newspaper print of that day .

		They bore upon their paper covers varying and utterly dissimilar likenesses of the candidate , in the form of dingy woodcuts .

		The engraver 's effort to impose upon his subject all the air of distinction which the seasoned statesman is expected to carry is quite ap - parent .

		Of these early volumes , five appeared anonym - ously in
1860	DATE	; a number probably belonging to the flame year have no imprint date ; and of the re - mainder , four are accredited respectively to
J. H. Barrett	PERSON	,
D. W. Bartlett	PERSON	,
William D. Howells	PERSON	, and
John Locke Scripps	PERSON	.

		Of these authors ,
Bartlett	PERSON	was
Washington	LOCATION	correspondent of the

		POE AND ARISTOTLE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's admirable and acute discussion of ''
Poe	PERSON	's Place as a Critic , '' published in The Dial of
February 16	DATE	, the writer dwells at considerable length on one of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's critical dicta , namely , that there can be no long poem in the nature of things .

		`` The nature of things '' is a loose phrase ; he meant , probably , the natural powers of attention and memory .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	objects that
Poe	PERSON	has left us in doubt as to what meas - ure of length he would fix in strictly defining a poem .

		Poe was apt to be whimsical and vague in criticism , but sometimes he hit the nail on the head .

		I think he had already anticipated the impatience of modern readers of poetry , as well as of poets themselves .

		Perhaps he was also thinking of the time when poetry was recited ; which would naturally imply a time-limit .

		If he had said no long poems are now written and no one has time or mind to attend to them , he would have come near the truth .

		The longest poem has now the shortest life .

		And if read , it is for the purpose of finding and enjoy - ing its gems , its striking passages .

		These , if really great , are soon disengaged and re-set as specimens , and are gathered at last into anthologies .

		Poe therefore laid down a rule in accordance with popular taste , possibly to cover his own work , and to justify his never attempt - ing a poem of any length .

		It used to be urged upon poets who attained some fame in verse , that for the completion of their reputation , or for the honor of their country , their work should be crowned with one supreme effort , -- if possible , an epic on a great theme .

		And poets themselves seem to have been impelled by the same desire for Aristotle 's '' cer - tain magnitude '' in their works .

		Yet I can not quite agree with Mr.
Moore	PERSON	in his application of Aristotle 's '' magnitude '' as referring to the length of a poem .

		Is not Mr.
Moore	PERSON	here speaking of long poems in dis - tinction from short ones ?

		Unless I mistake , he is .

		But in the place where Aristotle employs the expression '' certain magnitude , '' chapter seven of the Poetics , he is not discussing length or quantity of poems .

		He is speak - ing only of tragedy ; and he means by magnitude simply a consistent action , perfect and whole , -- or , as we might express it , a large , beautiful , and orderly arrange - ment and treatment of the theme , and only long enough to be easily remembered .

		Aristotle expressly says that length with reference to dramatic representation does not fall under the consideration of art .

		In short , as I understand Aristotle he is not referring to poetry ia general but to the construction of tragedies . '

		Yet there can be no doubt that in the classic period of Greek literature long poems were held in higher es - timation than short ones .

		Lyrical and occasional verse had also its place of honor , --
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	,
Sappho	PERSON	, and many others , being as popular poets as Homer .

		In Aristotle 's comment on magnitude it must be remembered that he refers solely to tragedies .

		As these were sometimes in the form of trilogies , he had to take into account mag - nitude , or length , and explain its propriety , -- not as mere length but as duration of time in the action ; yet to this he denies any part in artistic theory .

		1 would like to add to the list of great and authori - tative critics cited by Mr.
Moore	PERSON	,
Goethe	PERSON	, who has left a larger though scattered body of purely literary criti - cism than either Aristotle or
Lessing	PERSON	.

		And he is at one with
Poe	PERSON	, in both theory and practice , in regard to long poems , if we leave out , as we ought , his dramatic works .

		For by a long poem I apprehend we mean such as `` The Faerie Queene , '' '' Paradise Lost '' and '' Paradise Re - gained , '' `` Roman de la Rose , '' `` The Divine Comedy , '' and the works of Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	.

		It is to be noticed in all long poems , that when closely analysed they consist largely of episodes , -- as if the authors realized that the reader 's attention and memory could not be relied on to carry him through without a break .

		All long poems with which I am acquainted may be resolved into short ones , and were so resolved in the more ancient times when recited ; and thus I think
Poe	PERSON	was right in his phi - losophy in saying that in the nature of things -- that is , iu the constitution of the poet and of the hearer or reader , and for the perfect effects of poetry , including the shock of delighted surprise and the fixing in the memory , -- there can be no long poems .

		Of course ,
Poe	PERSON	never intended to include dramatic composition in his dictum .

		There is where length -- or , in
Aristotle	LOCATION	's word , '' magnitude , '' -- has its appropriate place and rights ; unless , as iu
Lessing	PERSON	's story , the '' characters die of the Fifth Act . ''

		Allow me to conclude with a line from a poet who was also a master critic ,
Horace	PERSON	; and to translate it into the vernacular : '' Verum operi longe fas est obrepere somnum . ''

		Democracy and
Political Paktiks	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Democratic institutions have had attention , to the neglect of the political forces from which they have derived their life .

		Men have so busied themselves in spreading the machinery • of democratic government over the world that they have not stopped to inquire whether de - mocracy and its machinery are one .

		Indeed , to many the test of democracy itself is the effi - ciency of the machinery of democratic govern - cnent .

		It was quite time to consider whether permanent political parties , having power as their end , with general contracts to solve all political problems as they arise , are essential to democratic government .

		Mr.
M. Ostrogorski	PERSON	, a Russian who has long resided in
Paris	LOCATION	, in two large volumes entitled '' Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties , '' sets forth with ffreat clearness the results of a most ex - haastive investigation of this question .

		Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, in a preface to the book , notes that no one has produced a treatise '' cootaining a gystematic examination and description of the structure of parties as organizations goremed bj settled rules and working h \ established methods .

		Even in the
United States	LOCATION	, where party organization ■ early attained a completeness and effective power un - approached in any other country , I could not find , when in
1883	DATE	I began to study and was seeking to portray the institutions of that country , any account of the very re - markable and well-compacted scheme of organization which had been at work there for forty or fifty years ; and noted that among even the best-educated men there were few who had mastered its details . ''

		Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	, in his preface , states it to be his purpose to '' investigate the working of democratic government , '' and adds , '' But it is not on political forms , it is on political forces that I dwell . ''

		He holds that '' The best way to study political forces is to study pol - itical methods ; ... to really understand the character of social action , its modes of procedure must be studied in the light of the character of those who apply them , and of the social and political conditions in which their wills are formed and manifested .

		It is only in this sense that the investigation of political methods will have , in addition to a philosophical value , a genuine practical valoe .

		It is a study of the methods of democratic gov - ernment conceived in this spirit , a study of social and political psychology , based on observation , that I have tried to undertake , and it is that which is the aim of this book . ''

Oboaxization of Political Pabttks	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated from the French by
Frederick Clarke	PERSON	.

		With a preface by
James Bryce	PERSON	.

		In ` two
Toliunee	ORGANIZATION	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author has indeed succeeded in his pur - pose of '' putting together a whole , which , under the form of a scientific investigation , alike historical and critical , of the rigime of organized parties , is in reality an investi - gation of the working of government in democracy , and of the vital problems which it puts before existing so - ciety and which involve the whole future of our polit - ical civilization . ''

		In pursuit of this great purpose , Mr.
Ostro	PERSON	- gorski has made a most painstaking and thorough study , extending over many years , of party organization and party action in both En - gland and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		These countries were chosen , because in them liberty has at - tained its highest development ; and because there political parties exhibit the greatest regu - larity of action .

		Though in
England	LOCATION	the organ - ization of parties founded on a popular basis was more recent than in the
United States	LOCATION	, the author found there an excellent starting-point for his investigations .

		The book opens with a striking and compre - hensive view of ' `` The Old Unity '' ; of apolitical society , organized on the basis of aristocracy ; of the absolute domination of an aristocratic class .

		This is followed by an equally strong and clear description of the break-up of the old society ; of the advent of democracy , shattering in its course '' a social fabric which was too narrow to contain the national life '' ; of the exaltation of the individual ; of the assertion by the many of the right of self-government .

		Then comes an account of the attempts at re - action against the rising tide of individualism ; of the effort of the Church to restore the old unity ; of the Oxford movement , which , starting nnder the banner of authority and tradition , '' succeeded in proving that liberty is , after all , the safest principle of conduct in modem so - ciety '' ; of the `` Young England '' movement '' to combat the destruction of the old political creed which knit classes and individuals to - gether '' ; of the war waged by
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	against `` the new social system bred of
Ben	PERSON	- thamism and industrialism , '' due tohis contempt for and hatred of democracy ; of the Christian Socialist movement to oppose the principle of free competition by means of industrial associa - tions .

		The author next describes '' The Triumph of the New Order , '' the realization of individual - ism in the sphere of politics .

		With the passing of the domination of an aristocratic class and the substitution of numbers as the supreme power in the state , a new danger appeared .

		The newly emancipated individual ran the 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, risk of being crushed by numbers .

		It was not enough for him to share sovereignty with his fellows .

		If he would participate in the govern - ment , he had to find some extra-legal means of cooperation with others seeking similar ends .

		If he would realize his objects in society and the state , be must come to an understanding with his fellow citizens .

		Liberty emancipated the individual .

		The preservation of liberty itself called for the union of individual efforts .

		Hence arose political par - ties .

		Here lies the field which Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	has explored with a thoroughness all his own .

		No such examination of the extra-legal cooper - ation which has supplied motive power to demo - cratic government has before been attempted .

		The book is a veritable storehouse of facts .

		Many of its chapters are purely descriptive .

		Take , for example , the chapter entitled '' The National Convention . ''

		This masterly descrip - tion of the vast and tumultuous assemblages , in which quadrennially , the party champions are chosen , is complete even to the smallest ac - cessories .

		One who has never even heard of these modern Olympics can see , as he reads , the colossal travesties of popular institutions from whence issue the names of those to whom our choice of a chief magistrate is limited .

		With - out fear or favor , the author clearly states the results of the most searching personal investi - gations , extending over some fifteen years , into the organization and action of political parties in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Holding his conclu - sions well in reserve until he has fully set forth the facts , he has given the descriptive parts of his work the force of a judicial finding .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	is not wholly pleased with Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	's picture of party organization in
England	LOCATION	.

		While frankly conceding the au - thor 's description to be on the whole both ac - curate and fair , that taken one by one the facts stated are almost always correctly stated , he thinks that the author exaggerates the power and poison of the Caucus and does not suffi - ciently allow for the healthy influences that tend to correct the dangers its growth may in - volve .

		However , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	proceeds to break the force of his `` word of caution . ''

		He says : `` I am myself an optimist , almost a professional optimist , as indeed politics would be intolerable were not a man grimly resolved to see between the clouds all the blue sky he can . ''

		He adds : '' Party organization is a totally different thing in
England	LOCATION	from what it is in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is in the hands of a different class of men . ''

		The word of caution uttered by Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	touching Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	's picture of English partyism will be repeated here with reference to the vast canvas whereon he has painted American partyism with all its deformities .

		Already an American critic has said : '' He does not mean to exaggerate , and nearly every statement , taken by itself , is substantially cor - rect .

		Yet , admitting the several parts of the argument , one finds himself objecting to the whole . ''

		It is not enough that one who admits that every line is correctly drawn shall object to the picture as a whole .

		He must point out some omission or want of proportion , if his objection is to have weight .

		Has Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	omitted anything essential from his picture of partyism in the
United States	LOCATION	?

		Do its lines betray any material lack of proportion ?

		Is it overcharged with gloom ?

		Gloomy it unquestionably is , as Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	remarks .

		Yet one will search in vain for any important omission from the au - thor 's description of our party machinery and of our party methods .

		He has faithfully ex - amined and correctly described their every de - tail of construction , their every mode of action ; and he has summarized with substantial accu - racy the results .

		His most obvious error lies in his underestimate of the benefits that have resulted from the introduction of the
Austra	LOCATION	- lian ballot .

		Had he been in
America	LOCATION	in
1888	DATE	, as well as in
1896	DATE	, Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	would have realized more fully than he does the value of this reform .

		Its value becomes even more clear with every passing year .

		There is a factor , indefinite but real , for which Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	has not sufficiently al - lowed .

		This is public opinion .

		Over all our political activities broods a public opinion which nearly always restrains and sometimes directs .

		The wholesome fear of it usually entertained among politicians accounts for the fact , noted by Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	, that from the nominees of our national conventions the people have chosen a line of Presidents who , '' if they have not all been great men , -- far from it , -- were all hon - orable men . ''

		The influence of public opinion can not be measured .

		Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	notes some of its affirmative triumphs in the passage of the civil service , the Australian ballot , and recent monetary laws .

		It is not strange that a foreign student should fail fully to realize its value as a restraining force and as a ground of hope .

		The marvel is that he has so completely mastered and so justly appraised what may be really known of our political methods .

		The scientific investigator may be excused from
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 195 t appraising what may not be examined .

		Each reader , according to his vision , will , with Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, see what blue sky he can between the clouds of party politics .

		Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	passes from party organiza - tion and the evils of permanent political parties , to a survey of our struggles for emancipation since the Civil War , and to a discussion of remedies .

		As the years pass , voluntary asso - ciations , alliances , committees , federations , and leagues appear ; '' scratchers , '' `` mugwumps , '' and '' independents '' multiply .

		The sporadic committee organized to crush this boss , or to smash that machine , at length gives place to the compact league of independent voters having a definite common purpose .

		Men , emancipated from a party bondage which held them while special interests despoiled a continent of vast public resources , gradually unite in a wide co - operation to rescue their government from party spoilsmen .

		Thus far the movement against the evils of party domination has been largely confined to the sphere of municipal government .

		Here the need was more obvious , but not more real , than in the state and nation . ''

		Yet the indepeodent morements which have taken place in the sphere of the national parties have not re - mained unfruitful .

		If nonpartisanship has made snch strides in the municipal field , this is owing to their dis - solvent action ; mugwumpism , too weak to produce rav - ages in the national parlies , penetrated into the mu - nicipal sphere following the lines of least resistance .

		... However , the national political life itself did not whollv escape the new notions about the independence of the elector 's couscience ... ; these notions per - vaded the political atmosphere , exercising a subtle and deleterious influence on the traditional sentiments of party loyalty . ''

		More important than its immediate results , the movement which thus far has found its main expression in the sphere of municipal reform has introduced new methods of public action , methods which may stamp or even de - termine the future of democracy .

		But the best political methods require the motive power supplied by an aggressive public spirit .

		Too few are yet imbued with this spirit . ''

		There is a sincere desire to see the machines and bosses disappear , but people would like this result to be obtained , if possible , in an automatic way , so to speak , which would make up for personal exertion .

		There is , therefore , a tendency to look to the legislator to arrange the legal machinery in such a fashion as to defeat the enemies of good government . ''

		The constituted authorities have become , under party domination , more and more un - equal to their oflBcial duties .

		The leaders of opinion rarely seek or occupy public station .

		The initiative has passed even from
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It acts on impulses coming from without It legislates , as to many matters , by direction of special interests : it registers , as to matters of peculiar public interest , the legislation of vol - untary organizations of private citizens .

		How great has been the change from other days , is indicated by a single illustration .

		The demoral - ization of the finances due to the Civil War , having been allowed by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to continue for a generation , a national conference of private citizens finally initiated a remedial measure .

		Think of an
Indianapolis Conference	ORGANIZATION	to pre - pare financial legislation when
Alexander Ham	PERSON	- ilton or
Salmon P. Chase	PERSON	was secretary of the treasury I Modern society , when it came into posses - sion of liberty , placed its chief reliance on parliaments .

		It sought to escape tyranny by hedging its executives about with legal re - straints .

		Disappointed by a bitter experience , due at least in large part to the usurpations of party , it has turned for relief to a powerful ex - ecutive supported by the negative authority of the courts .

		Dictators , from the Speaker of the
House	ORGANIZATION	down to mayors of cities , find themselves possessed of the chief powers of government .

		Private initiative having detected and pun - ished official malfeasance , cleansed the streets , secured public works , and framed legislation , found itself unable steadily and effectively to check the spoliation of the people by powerful groups of citizens acting impersonally as quasi - public corporations .

		`` To obtain more durable and more regular effects than could be achieved by these spasmodic efforts , attempts were made to straighten the relaxed govern - mental spring by main fotce ; inadequacy of action being mistaken for inadequacy of powers , the latter were concentrated in the hands of a few pereoos . ''

		This leads Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	, in his conclusion , to propose a remedy for existing evils .

		He re - gards permanent political parties , having power as their end , a mortal danger to democracy .

		`` The great parties , viewed as a whole , have been throughout their career nothing but agglomerates arti - ficially brought together and kept together ... Al - ways endeavoring to throw a veil over divergences of views and to eliminate principles , it substituted for the process of analysis and synthesis of opinions , which onght to take place in the electorate to create a legis - lative assembly animated by one mind and one will , a purely artificial analysis and synthesis , obtained by the saving grace of the party label .

		As soon as the mani - fold interests jumbled together under this label got ad - mitted into the
House	ORGANIZATION	, they naturally reverted to their own particular aspirations . ''

		The sole concern of the party being to manage the elections and win the spoils of victory , it 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, did nothing to repress these centrifugal tend - encies .

		The result was , in large measure , the paralysis of representative government .

		That individual rights have survived is due to the simplicity and limited scope of government in the
United States	LOCATION	and the constitutional guar - antees of liberty which everywhere prevail , -- in a word , to the remarkable success of written constitutions imposing limitations on govern - ment .

		The author would substitute for permanent political parties , with power as their end , tem - porary combinations of citizens formed specially for particular political issues . ''

		Party , as a general contractor for the numerous and varied problems present and to come , awaiting solution , would give place to special organizations , limited to particular objects .

		It would cease to be a medley of groups and individuals united by a fictitious agreement , and would constitute au association , the homogeneity of which would be ensured by its single aim .

		Party holding its members , once they have joined it , in a vice - like grasp , would give place to combinations forming and re-fotming spontaneously , according to the chang - ing problems of life and the play of opinion brought about thereby .

		Citizens who part company on one ques - tion would join forces on another . ''

		Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	believes that the substitution of temporary for permanent political parties will emancipate the individual ; that he will never wholly surrender himself to party , will always realize his liberty as a free man ; and that , freed from the nightmare of party '' regularity , '' he will exercise his personal judgment .

		Unlike parties of agglomerate creeds , each single-issue association will devote itself wholly to the task of making converts . ''

		Political society will be transformed into a vast school , and democratic government will become really a government of discussion . ''

		These suggestions are neither so novel nor 80 impracticable as may at first appear .

		The old order , with its social unity , is no longer pos - sible .

		In an era of liberty , the harmony of the elements of society can be restored only by an agreement of wills .

		The new social synthesis required by an emancipated society lies in the free union of wills in varied and successive com - binations .

		It can not be effected once for all and about everything .

		Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	points out that the existing system is rapidly breaking up .

		Some of the old parties live on the credit of their past , which is well nigh exhausted . ''

		Compact and stable majorities are only a historical remi - niscence . ''

		Already the new method appears in the form of '' committees '' and '' leagues '' for definite purposes .

		The struggle between the two modes of political action is on .

		The cry of political evolution is , `` Down with ` party ' ; up with ` league . ' ''

		Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	holds no brief for absolution .

		It is not of democracy , but of party , that he de - clares : Its life is '' only one long school of ser - vile submission .

		All the lessons the citizen receives in it are lessons in cowardice . ''

		He loves democracy so well that he would save it from deadly peiil . ''

		Men must be taught to use their judgment , and to act independently .

		It is on the accomplishment of this work of liberation that the whole future of democracy depends .

		Hitherto the victorious struggle which democ - racy has carried on in the world has been mainly , and necessarily , a struggle for material liberty ; moral lib - erty , which consists in thinking and acting as free reason dictates , has yet to be achieved by it .

		It has carried the habeas corpus by force , but the decisive battle of democ - racy will be fought on the habeas animum .

		... It is the political and social forms anterior to democracy that are dead ... Democracy has brought with it liberty , and it has renewed the life of societies . ''

		The author is under no illusions as to what it means to overcome the formalism that op - presses democratic government .

		To him , vic - tory does not mean the complete realization by means of a single effort of the end proposed . ''

		The victories which bring about the political or so - cial transformations consist of changes in the trend of society towards the oue or the other of the opposing principles .

		However far they may go , these changes never entail the absolute triumph of principles , ... but they turn or move society in the direction leading to that ideal point to which it can draw nearer by means of fresh efforts , without ever reaching it .

		To gain a few points on the indefinite series of degrees , -- that is the task which confronts each generation , and which should satisfy its ambition and its ardor , and also its pride when the task is performed . ''

		The contribution of Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	to the literature of democracy is a great and valuable one .

		Into this book he has compressed the re - sults of many years of exhaustive study .

		Its pages exhibit ripe scholarship , unusual capacity for thinking clearly , and a just sense of propor - tion .

		Taken as a whole , it will please neither the cheerful optimist who ignores the facts , nor the friend of privilege who hates liberty .

		It will be welcomed everywhere by the real friends of democracy .

		De Tocqueville wrote a brilliant treatise on democracy , illustrated by observations on American institutions .

		Professor Von Hoist produced an exhaustive history of American constitutions .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	contributed a careful survey of the
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, par - ticularly of its government and politics as a whole .

		Mr.

		* For three generations the name of
Bowditch	LOCATION	has been identified with original research in two important branches of science -- mathe - matics and medicine .

		It has also an honor - able position in public life and in the records of good citizenship .

		The eminent physician who , with rare success , has edited the two vol - umes containing the biography and correspond - ence of his distinguished father , has rendered a valuable service not only to students of sci - ence but to students of American history as well .

		As he prefaces the work with the state - ment that here is '' the personal experience of an active Abolitionist , '' so he has recalled the vital incidents of that movement for which his father paid willing sacrifice ; at the same time he has interwoven abundant revelations of his father 's devotion to the progress of medicine .

		The public and personal incidents are tactfully blended .

		The childhood days in the Salem home , next to the
Old Witch House	ORGANIZATION	, are told with charm .

		The reader finds in this picture of
Nathaniel Bowditch	PERSON	, the wise , inspiring father of the subject of this sketch , a new fa - miliarity of relation with one who is most often recalled as the translator of La Place 's '' Me - canique Celeste . ''

		With a mind keen for re - search , young
Henry Bowditch	PERSON	decided , with some reluctance , to adopt medicine as his pro- fession ; and , college days ended , he went abroad to stay two years at foreign schools and hospitals .

		His fathers fame as a mathema - tician was his passport to many a noted salon besides that of Madame La Place , while his en - thusiasm for his work increased rapidly under the best of Parisian doctors , notably Dr.

Burns	PERSON	and ''

		Still more tender and reserved is the story of his love for the English girl , comrade of his pension experience , whose face smiles at the reader with the gracious beauty and `` sweet records '' of seventy years .

		Almost before Dr.
Bowditch	PERSON	could establish his professional life in
Boston	LOCATION	, came the open - ing discords , soon to become open rupture and war , between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this life - history , the familiar incidents of the
Garrison	PERSON	mob , the escape of the Crafts , and the rendi - tion of
Simms	PERSON	, are retold with the vividness of personal experience .

		The extracts covering these events are taken from the letters of Dr.
Bowditch	PERSON	, and from his journal-compilation entitled `` Thirty Years ' War of Anti-Slavery . ''

		In token of friendship for him and common zeal in the cause he served .

		Whittier wrote the stirring poem called ''
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' to be read by Dr.
Bowditch	PERSON	at a meeting in
Ipswich	LOCATION	; while
Lowell	LOCATION	, for a similar occasion , wrote the lines associated with the death of
Charles Torrey	PERSON	, '' Woe Worth the Hour . ''

		For the imported 8nn-dial , with quaint history , placed in front of the
Bowditch	LOCATION	home - stead at
Weston	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	, in further attesta - tion of his friendship , wrote the beautiful stanza of aspiration , -- '' With wamiDg hand I mark
Time	ORGANIZATION	's rapid flight .

		From life 's glad moming to its solemn night ; Yet , throagh the dear Gad 's love I also show There 's light above me bj the shade below . ''

		When the exciting events of the fifties had been succeeded by the actual conflict , the pa - triotic heart and practical mind of Dr. Bow - ditch gave their noble services to his country .

		Even when his first-born lay dead on a South - ern battle-field , the father stifled his grief and worked with renewed vigor to gain better am - bulances and hospital-service .

		In the midst of political crises .

		Dr.
Bowditch	PERSON	had continued his medical studies , as well as practice , urging new modes of treatment for diseases of chest and lungs .

		In this phase of medicine he was pioneer in the modern methods that have reached further efiSciency through the skill of his son .

		His fame in his profession brought him appointments of honor in this country , notably as a member of the
National Board of Health	ORGANIZATION	; and when he paid visits to
Europe	LOCATION	, in later life , he was greeted with dual acclaim , on his own as well as his father 's record , by 198 THE DIAL -LSB-

Annie Russell Marble	ORGANIZATION	.

		Remote Regions and Peoples of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		* For the past twenty years ,
Mexico	LOCATION	has been a much '' written-up '' country .

		There have been books upon books about
Mexico	LOCATION	, until it seemed that every phase of the subject had been exhaustively treated , and that
Mexico	LOCATION	was no longer terra incognita .

		But it occurred to the mind of Dr.
Carl Lumholtz	PERSON	, a few years ago , that there was still an unknown
Mexico	LOCATION	, -- a region that had escaped the attention of the rail - road and mining prospectors and of pleasure - seeking travellers ; a region beyond the ken of the Mexican scientists , and even of the Mexican Government ; a region that might hold a secret of great importance regarding the native races of
America	LOCATION	.

		A year or more spent among can - nibalistic blacks in
Australia	LOCATION	had deepened his interest in the study of savage and barbaric races , and he had decided to make that study his life-work .

		This scientifically unexplored region was therefore more attractive to him than any other , and he began forthwith to devise ways and means for a journey of discovery thither .

		By dint of much effort , he succeeded in engaging the interests of the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and many public-spirited men and women of the
United States	LOCATION	, and a fund was subscribed to enable him to pursue his scientific researches .

		In
1890	DATE	he made a pre - liminary visit to the Zuni ,

		There is in
Mexico	LOCATION	no
Bureau of Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, such as we have in this country ; but the broad-minded and progressive states - man who is the President of the Mexican Re - public hailed with enthusiasm the proposition of Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	, and furthered the ends of the enterprise to the fullest extent in his power .

		Thus accredited and equipped .

		Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	set out upon his explorations in the western ranges of the
Sierra Madre	ORGANIZATION	in
Northwestern Mexico	LOCATION	, at the head of an organized party of thirty men , including geographers , geologists , mineralogists , zoologists , botanists , archaeolog - ists , photographers , guides , cooks , muleteers , and requiring the services of nearly a hundred animals .

		But the corps of scientific assistants was gradually reduced , and finally altogether disbanded .

		The enterprising explorer was left alone to continue his researches .

		An early result was that he was able to return to the
United States	LOCATION	, in
August , 1893	DATE	, with an exten - sive collection of Tarahumare and Tepehuane ethnological specimens to be exhibited at the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Meanwhile , his fullest expectations had been realized by his finding among the Tarahumare Indians actual cave-dwellers .

		With deepened interest , he set out , in
March , 1894	DATE	, upon a more extensive expedition , which lasted three years .

		On this trip he was without scientific compan - ions , and '' roughed it '' for the most part with the Indians .

		During these years the privileged few who had access to the published proceed - ings and bulletins of the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and kindred organizations , might have informed themselves of some very important ethnological and archaeological discoveries that were being made in
Northwestern Mexico	LOCATION	; and readers of '' Scribner 's Magazine '' could not have failed to become interested in some arti - cles from the pen of Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	, regarding the cave-dwelling of the Tarahumares .

		Eigh - teen months were spent among these Indians , and ten months among the Coras and Huichols ; and much knowledge was gained of the North and
South Tepehuanes	LOCATION	, the Tepeeanos , the
Nahuas	PERSON	-LRB- whom we usually call the Aztecs -RRB- , and the
Tarascoa	LOCATION	.

		A supplementary expedition was made , with Dr.
Ales Hrdlicka	PERSON	, in
1898	DATE	, extend - ing over three or four months , and including another visit to the Tarahumares and Huichols .

		In his intercourse with the various tribes .

		Dr.

		THE DIAL 199 witness their most sacred religious ceremonies , to take photographs of the various ethnological types which presented themselves for his in - Testigation , to make collections of articles nsed in their ceremonials and even of skulls from their burial-places .

		He not only filled his note-books with data regarding the geology , the flora and fauna of the country , and with ethnological observations of the most valuable character , but he acquired a general knowl - edge of the languages in use among these tribes , and made extensive collections of an - thropological measurements , samples of hair , osseous remains , aboriginal melodies , folk-lore , myths , and traditions .

		The story of these expeditions by Dr.
Lam	PERSON	- holtz , and of his life among the Indians , we DOW have in two sumptuous octavo volumes , containing more than 1000 pages , illustrated with 530 half-tone reproductions of photo - graphs taken by the author , besides sixteen plates in color and three excellent maps , -- altogether the most valuable contribution that has been made of recent years to the literature of scientific exploration and discovery in the
Western World	LOCATION	.

		The author 's pleasant liter - ary style , his keen sense of humor , and bis kindly philosophy , take these volumes out of the category of purely scientific works and make them of deep interest to the general reader , who will find scarcely a dull page in either volume .

		The story is one of adventures of an unusual sort , all simply told and without any striving after effects .

		More than once the author and his scientific treasures had a narrow escape from total destruction , as was the case at a ranch in the state of
Michoacan	LOCATION	, where he accepted the proffer of a bed-room .

		His Indian servant lit a candle , and , perceiving a jar in a box near the bed , tried to use it as a candle - stick .

		Fortunately , his efforts to stick the taper in the mouth of the jar were unsuccessful , for the host presently stepped forward , remarking quietly , '' It is better to put the candle some - where else , because this is dynamite . ''

		The summing up by Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	, of his experiences after he had reached quasi - civilization , is calculated to make ethnologists of us all .

		Only those who have enjoyed the delights of being in close touch with nature can understand and appreciate the fascination which that region , not yet reached by man 's aggres - sive spirit , had for him .

		He suffered much in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Malaria has a peculiar power of making one feel the misery of life ; but the pleasant memories of his stay in
Northwestern Mexico	LOCATION	far outranked the disagreeable .

		He never felt lonely among the Indians .

		So much was constantly happening in that little world of theirs , that he could not help feeling inter - ested and stimulated in observing and studying them .

		Sharing their joys and sorrows , enter - ing into their thoughts , and learning to under - stand their lore and their traditions , he felt him - self carried back thousands of years into the early stages of human history .

		Primitive people taught him a new philosophy of life , for their ignorance is nearer the truth than our preju - dice ; and though they have much to learn from us , we also have many things to learn from them besides those things which are coldly set down in scientific reports .

		* An exceedingly interesting chapter of liter - ary history is that which recounts the gradual progress of the revolt against the spirit and doc - trine of classicism , as they had been elaborated and refined in
France	LOCATION	in the grand siecie , and had triumphantly invaded the other literatures of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The part that the works of Shakes - peare played in this reaction is well known .

		It has several times been made the subject of special studies .

		It is a portion of this field that Professor Lonnsbury cultivates in the second Tolnme of his series co ^ ' Shakespearean Wars . ''

		In this volume he has set himself the task of telling the story of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's relations to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, `` of the influence originally ex - erted upon him by the English dramatist , of the war he waged against the latter 's growing reputation on the continent , of the hostility evoked in turn towards himself in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		It is the latter story that has professedly en - gaged the author 's particular attention , and the chapters devoted to it contain perhaps the freshest material of the volume .

		But these chapters make up rather less than a quarter of the four hundred and fifty pages of the whole .

		The others turn pretty closely about
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's dealings with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and this story has Ions : since been made familiar to us .

		After the special studies of which it had been the object , there was not much of real importance to be gleaned from a new search of the field .

France	LOCATION	; of his later efforts to undo the mis - chief he fancied he had wrought ; of his nu - merous borrowings from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and his reticence with regard to them ; of his unscru - pulous tactics in controversy and his shameless mendacity , -- of all this we were already abun - dantly informed .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	has gone into this story with greater detail than his predecessors , but without modifying essen - tially our view of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward works so teeming with interest and power and human reality that they compelled his curious wonder and surprise , yet cast in a mould alike so repugnant aesthetically to his sense of beauty and irreconcilable with his reasoned theories of art , and mirroring a world of feeling and action so innocent of the jurisdiction of the convenances of life in a salon , that he was sin - cerely repelled , shocked , and disgusted .

		In - deed , our general view of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's attitude is rather obscured by the fulness of the nar - rative and the emphasis laid upon its separate episodes .

		The stress laid upon the bitterness of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's later criticisms of Shakespeare easily creates the impression that his view of the qualities of his dramatic works had shifted with time and the dangerous literary toleration that he observed about him .

		The correcting statement of the concluding chapter , that '' there was never any real change in
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's opinion about Shakespeare , '' is therefore distinctly called for .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	is careful to tell us , in his preface , that he proposes to confine himself strictly to the story of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's relations with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	; and he distinctly disclaims all in - tention of setting these in their historical per - spective as apart of the history of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's invasion of
France	LOCATION	.

		That , in spite of this dis - claimer , he feels the disadvantage of thus isola - ting his actors from their background , is shown by his filling it in at several points , seeing rightly that it was necessary to the understanding of their feelings and utterances .

		It is to be regret - ted that he did not also bring them into connec - tion with the larger background of the general movement of ideas of the time .

		One might easily carry away the impression that the revolt against classicism was wholly a result of the spreading knowledge of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		One does not feel quite sure that this is not Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's view , so completely does he ignore that part of the anti-classical current that was wholly independent of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The influence of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works in break - ing down the tradition of classicism was enor - mous , doubtless ; but it was not alone , nor would it have been of itself sufficient .

		To give it such exclusive emphasis magnifies unduly the doctrinal and formal element among literary influences , and leaves out of account the close dependence of literature upon life .

		No amount of familiarity with the works of Shakespeare in the original tongue could have given the public of the age of Louis XIV .

		any misgivings as to the authority of the classical rules .

		Those rules , and the conception of dramatic art which they embody , were too closely connected with the ideas upon which the whole life and society of the time rested , and no amount of argument and no sympathetic interpretation of foreign literatures could have availed to shake the au - thority of those rules so long as life conformed unhesitatingly to those ideas .

		The romantic drama of
Spain	LOCATION	was by no means unknown to the founders of the French classical tradition , but this knowledge did not modify in any degree the rigorous development of the classical form - ula .

		Could the works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	have circulated in
France	LOCATION	in the
latter half of the seventeenth century	DATE	, it is impossible to believe that representatives of French culture could have read them except by a powerful and con - stant effort of the will .

		That these works were greeted with eager curiosity by a considerable public in the middle of the eighteenth century , is not more prophetic of changes that were to overtake the received poetic creed in
France	LOCATION	than significant of changes that had already taken place in French society and ideas .

		The famous quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns was a very empty affair so long as both parties were at one as to the sufficiency of the ideals that shaped life and conduct throughout the recognized `` monde '' under the great Louis .

		It was not till the insufiiciency of these ideals began to be felt , with an accompanying sense of irritation and restlessness at the narrowness of the horizons to which , with all their distinction and elegance , they had condemned men 's out - look over the world , that the forms of classical art were seriously questioned .

		And if , after all , the eighteenth century came but to a very im - perfect comprehension of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's art , it was primarily because it still came to the pic - ture of life he gave with the inherited habits and preconceptions of the elegant courtly ideal .

		Indeed , it may be suggested that if Voltaire seemed at the moment of leaving
England	LOCATION	more
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 open to the appeal of Shakespeare than ever afterward , it was because the outlines of his courtly ideal were at that moment a little dimmed , and the immediate impressions of life uppermost with him were those received from English society .

		It is to be regretted , then , that Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	did not give us a glimpse of those new elements of a wider and different outlook on life that the eighteenth century was accumulating .

		If this dependence of literary form and theory upon the larger background of national culture and the general theory and practice of living is not taken account of as one would wish it were , it is yet here and there more or less fully implied , and once at least plainly asserted .

		`` No literature of any sort , '' the author says , '' can succeed permanently which does not strike its roots deep down into the national character and life . ''

		The application he makes of this view to French literature shows perhaps why it seems to have been so o-enerally disregarded in his treatment of his subject .

		For he denies to the drama of French classicism that deep foundation in the national character and life that alone may support en - during fame .

		One must conclude , then , that the works of
Racine	LOCATION	and
Corneille	PERSON	have lost their power to charm French audiences , or that Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	knows that they certainly will lose it .

		The question of the future may very well be appealed to that court of last re - sort that alone can pronounce the final judg - ment .

		But as to the present , does Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	mean to say that the success of the French classical drama has already come to an end ?

		With what grief and horror such an opinion would fill M. Brunetiere I And on - what shall we base our judgment of the present success of authors of more than two centuries ago ?

		What proofs could we give of the vitality of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works for the great English - speaking world that could not be matched with equal evidences of the continued favor of the classical masterpieces for the French public ?

		This is one of the difficulties that arise from Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's view that the French classical drama is not a national product , and that the differences that separate the drama of the age of Louis XIV .

		from that of the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	are not those which separate the two nations , but only such as separate a special class , an elite aristocracy , from the whole people .

		`` The P-iiglish theatre was the theatre of the nation ; the French was the theatre of a class .

		The energy , the liberty , the disregard of useless conventions which
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	had found in the drama of the land to which he had come , were not really due , as he fancied , to the different character of the people , any more than was what was in his eyes its rudeness , its license , its dis - regard of decorum .

		Similarly , the elegance , the deli - cacy , the beauty of the drama of which he boasted , did not owe their existence to the character of the people he had left behind , any more than did the monotony , the lifelessness , the dull dialogue of which he constantly complained .

		These are not and can not be distinctive features of the stages of different nations in which social life is essentially the same ; they are the marks which distinguish the drama of an aristocracy from that of a whole people .

		Results essentially alike would have followed in each country , had the conditions been alike . ''

		Yes , -- no doubt like results would have fol - lowed like conditions .

		But just in the like - ness or unlikeness of conditions lies the whole matter .

		Has unlikeness of conditions no sig - nificance as to likeness of national character ?

		Could conditions so immensely different as those of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	at the time of their literary blossoming have come about with essential identity of character in the two peo - ples ?

		Or , if such different conditions could be imposed upon two peoples of like characters , would they not of necessity speedily diverge ?

		Without stopping to examine within what limits , if at all , the assertion is true that the French classical drama is that of an aristocracy , while that of
England	LOCATION	is the drama of a whole people , one can not help wondering upon what it depended , if national character was in no wise concerned , that the theatres played such a vastly different part in the two countries .

		It is , no doubt .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's en - thusiastic devotion to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	that has kept him from putting himself at the standpoint of French classicism and doing it fuU justice , as it has led him to emphasize so specially the role of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works as a literary influence .

		It is this same devotion that has prompted him to ascribe to Voltaire a feeling that he pretty certainly never had . ''

		It is hard to escape from the impression that in
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's inmost soul there lurked , in spite of his colossal self-conceit , a vague consciousness of inferiority , whenever he came to measure himself with the great dramatist .

		He was overpowered by something , he knew not what . ''

		Surely .

		French observers of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	have had no difficulty in escaping from this impression .

		But we shall not blame this devotion , since to it we owe also the fullest and most minute presentation that the relations of Voltaire to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	have yet found , or are likely to find ; and we need not find fault if it is fuller than we think it need have been .

		The author 's plan is simple .

		Starting with the
White Horse Tavern	ORGANIZATION	, at the head of Broad Street , he works gradually down to the neigh - borhood known as '' the Ferry , '' where the re - motest houses stood in
1665	DATE	.

		He describes the topography of the town , street by street , com - paring it constantly with the same streets of to-day .

		He gives a sketch of the history of each building and its owners or dwellers , of ne - cessity looking backwards and forwards from his chosen date .

		Among the more interesting chapters are those dealing with the
West India Company	ORGANIZATION	and its Colonial Officers ,
Dominie Bogardus	PERSON	,
Cornells Melyn	PERSON	the patroon of
Staten Island	LOCATION	,
Jacob Steendam	PERSON	the poet , the '' Great Tavern '' afterwards the
Stadt Huys	PERSON	or Town
Hall	PERSON	, and
Govert Loockermans	PERSON	and his family .

		The author goes somewhat out of his way to give the history of Captain
Kidd	PERSON	, who does not be - long to this period , and to discuss the identity of
William Paterson	PERSON	, a Scotchman who settled in
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	for a time , and who may possibly have been the founder of the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	.

Valen	PERSON	- tine ; but he fortifies himself by proofs , gen - erally beyond dispute , -- as in his claim for
Jan Vinje	PERSON	-LRB- Jean Vigne -RRB- , rather than
Sarah Rapalje	PERSON	, as being the first child of European parentage born in
New Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		The author 's rhetorical style is not especially to be commended , and he has a fashion of somewhat lengthy sentimental allusions to old-world scenes and events that is somewhat confusing .

		Nevertheless , the book is full of the material of history and romance , and worthy of careful study .

		Mr.
Rufus Rockwell Wilson	PERSON	's ''
New York	LOCATION	, Old and New '' is larger in plan and less min - ute in detail than the work of Mr.
Innes	PERSON	.

		It is , moreover , intended primarily as a gift-book , and is therefore more popular in style .

		It is bound in two attractive volumes , with numer - ous illustrations but no maps , and a fairly good index .

		To those who have read the author 's previous works it is unnecessary to say that these volumes are entertaining , and to many they will certainly be instructive as well .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	does not name the authorities for his facts , except in a few scattered instan - ces ; but inasmuch as he does not put forward any new discoveries , we may reasonably infer that he bases his work upon Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	, Val - entine , and other well-known writers .

		Indeed , he says in his preface that `` the preparation of this work necessarily involved a study of every noteworthy authority . ''

		In other words , he is the conservative chronicler , rather than an original investigator like Mr.
Innes	PERSON	.

		He has succeeded very well in his endeavors to make an interesting sketch of
New York	LOCATION	's history `` for the busy reader of slender purse , '' and to give it careful and impartial treatment .

		The first volume contains a consecutive his - tory of the city , outlining briefly the main events from
Hudson	LOCATION	's time down to the forma - tion of '' Greater
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		The survey is necessarily rapid , but the author finds space for descriptive chapters touching the social and topographical conditions in each period .

		He has placed emphasis throughout on what he calls the personal element ; that is , he has the story-teller 's touch , and has seized upon the picturesque at some sacrifice of dry details , dates , etc. .

		The second volume is concerned with
New York	LOCATION	of the present day , and takes the reader on numerous strolls through the city , locating places that have historic or other interest .

		Here there is necessarily some repe -

		The district cov - ered includes not only the old city , as in ''
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	and its People , '' but also the north - ern end of the island , including
Harlem	LOCATION	and the `` Neutral ground . ''

		There is also a chapter entitled * ' Little Sisters of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, '' treat - ing of the neighboring islands -- Governor 's ,
Bedloe	ORGANIZATION	's ,
Ward 's	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		Many interesting an - ecdotes bearing on the old Dutch burghers , governors , and lords of the manor , on the town under English rule , and on the Revolutionary period , are here given , as well as much pleasant gossip about the players , writers , and other residents of the town in the early and middle part of the last century .

		Some items are fa - miliar enough , but many are altogether new .

		The most serious fault of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's work , in our estimation , is the frequent use of quota - tions without specifying their authors , and the entire absence of notes .

		The author also stands convicted of the use of the split infinitive , an - noying to so many readers .

		However , these faults do not prevent the work from being a more complete supplementary guide-book to
New York	LOCATION	than any of its predecessors , as well as very interesting reading besides .

		Several articles on the political and social aspects of modern
Germany	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Wolf von Schierbrand	PERSON	, have appeared in recent years in oar prominent periodi - cals .

		Their aathor has now collected them and ex - tended the series to a ^ ood-sized volnme , which is published under the title , • •
Germany	LOCATION	: the Welding of a World Power '' -LRB-

		Page
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
von Schierbrand	PERSON	is a naturalized American eitixen , and for a number of years represented the
Aaaoeiated Press	ORGANIZATION	in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		He ha `` therefore had exceptional advantages for the preparation of his book ; he has not , however , risen above the style or the view-point of the ordinary newspaper corre - spondent .

		His book is interesting , at times gossipy , occasionally suggestive , but never profound or dis - criminating .

		Thus , the chapters on the Emperor present him simply as known by common report in the better classes of
Berlin	LOCATION	society .

		It is not a picture that adds to onr knowledge of the man or to our appreciation of his motives .

		Occasionally the illostrations of contradictory elements in the imperial policy -- the phrase * ' imperial antics '' is , by the way , to be deprecated -- are striking .

		Thns ,
William II	PERSON	.

		championed the reduction of classics and the introduction of broader technical training in the schools ; at the same time he urged the l , tx
Arous	LOCATION	, which subjected
University	ORGANIZATION	tutors to the rig ^ d supervision of the
Minister of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and thus threatened the boasted Lehrfreiheit of German academic instruction .

		Some examination of the reasons for this and similar contradictory positions would be instructive and valuable .

		The point of view throughout is that of modem
Berlin	LOCATION	, and the author 's attitude is unsympathetic The description of social life is startling in the f rankneaa with iriiieh it deals with certun phases of contemporaiy soeiely , but it would be deplorable were we to believe that the German nation is really so corrupt and so given over to luxury as it would seem .

		The jonmalist 's desire to be '' readable '' is too apparent No doubt the modern
Berlin	LOCATION	professor is a man of the world , but the picture drawn by Mr.
von Sehier	PERSON	-RRB- ''`` iid is as litUe typical of German academic teaehen , as a dMs , as was the caricature of
Fliegende Blatter	PERSON	, whieh he mistook for a type .

		life in general is really more genuine and less ^ schneidtg '' than it afipean on the mutmee , or as presented in this hook .

		Ontain du ^ iten , eepedallj those on the Agrarian and the Socialist movements , are worth commenda - tion ; that on Literature and Art , on the contrary , is singularly weak and unsatisfactory .

		On the whole the book is entertaining , but it can by no means be accepted as an authoritative discussion of the problems with which it deals .

		TtiMiisili ilili for its clearness and bnedth of insight is the art-criti - cism given us by Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	in his little volume of '' Views and Beviews : EaBays in Art Appreciation '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- .

		The book eon -
Mts	ORGANIZATION	ot abort enays and notes , most of them written S dosen yean age ; and , as the author states in the preface , scarcely changed and in no way modem - ixed .

		He has written with a fine contempt not only for public opinion , but also for all other critics , witli the two exceptions of
Eugene Fromentin	PERSON	and
R. A. M. Stevenson	PERSON	-LRB- a cousin of
Robert Louis	LOCATION	-RRB- , in praise of whom he devotes his last essay , under the title : '' A Critic of Art . ''

		What Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's own art-criti - cism aims at , is best told in his own language : ^ At least I may claim to have read few books into my pictures , to have done my best to keep my painting more or less unlettered , to have proffered my con - clusions , such as they are , fairly well purged of senti - ment .

		So did not Haxlitt , nor
Ruskin	PERSON	; and , if it must be that I faU with these , I doubt not -LRB- such is the vanity of man -RRB- that I shall take a sour pleaaara in reflecting that , be things as they may , my faOme is not on all-fours with theirs . ''

		He beg ^ ins with early romanticism , of which movement he has a great deal to say .

		and always from the point of view of the wor - shipper of a cult .

		In tracing the development of the painter 's art , he brings into close comparison the products of the sculptors , musicians , poets , novelists , and even actors , of the same time ; treating them all as parts of the great romantic movement , each in - fluencing the others .

		He sometimes becomes involved 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, in the great mass of his material ; but his first essay is headed '' A Note on Romanticism , '' and so we can not find fault if he has occasionally sacrificed logic for a delightful little side-excursion . ''

		Profiles Romantiques , '' which forms the second part of the book , is a series of short and trenchant sketches of nearly all the great romantic artists .

		Each one is Bummed up with a keenness that displays a knowl - edge of technique extraordinary in a layman .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's enthusiasms are given to
Corot	LOCATION	,
Delacroix	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and
Monticelli	PERSON	, -- in general , everything French ; for , in speaking of Meissonier , he says : '' The truth is , he is French of the French : French in his care for microscopic detail , French in his pa - tient ingenuity and his conscientious disdain for what seems to him bad work , French in the neat - ness of his ambitions , French in the dry impersonal quality of his color , the deftness of his handiwork , the logical effect of his line , the trim assurance of his effects . ''

		Only five Dutchmen are mentioned in the book ; but the Fnglish are treated at length , and Constable is given the place of highest favor , -- Constable , the disciple of
Claude	PERSON	.

		In addition to its other excellencies , Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's book succeeds in presenting a larger view of the scope of art and of the art-critic .

		He is not satisfied with himself till he has subjected each picture to the brightest search - light of analysis ; and he is not satisfied with a pic - ture that can not stand all his tests .

		One of his simplest tenets is that '' Imitation for its own sake is the basest of aims , and the pursuit of it can have but the meanest of results . ''

		A definOive ^ ^ ^ ** '' '' ^ y * ^ ^ ' ^ months ago that `` Kti < m de luxe an American firm began the publi - o/FitzOeraid .

		cation of a '' Variorum and Defini - tive '' edition of
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	's writings , con - taining in seven large volumes the various versions and revisions of all the published works .

		Now we have before us the first instalment of a ' * definitive edition de luxe '' of the same author , also in seven volumes , bearing in this case the imprint of
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's authorized publishers , the Messrs. Mac - millan , and edited by his literary executor , Mr.
W. Aldis Wright	PERSON	.

		The nearly simultaneous appear - ance of two such publishing enterprises would nat - urally bring them into rather direct comparison ; bat as it happens a just comparison is not possible in this instance , the editorial plans of the two edi - tions being wholly dissimilar .

		Each supplements the other , and the
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	enthusiast will not be content unless both repose upon his shelves .

		If confined to one or the other , our own choice would rest with the English edition , on several accounts .

		We are of those who prefer their English authors in English dress , for one thing .

		For another , we are content with
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's work in the form which he finally gave it , without regard to the in - termediate revisions and changes -- interesting as these often are .

		But the main reason for our pref - erence lies in the fact that the English edition con - tains the Letters , which being still in copyright were unavailable for the American undertaking .

		FitzGerald 's other prose works are of small account in comparison with the Letters ; even the Omar para - phrase has not so good a chance with posterity as those incomparable documents in which the Wood - bridge philosopher revealed to a few intimate friends the depths of his rarely beautiful personality .

		The collection here given us by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	includes all the known correspondence , comprising the original series published in
1889	DATE	, the additional letters contained in the '' Eversley '' edition of
1894	DATE	, the '' Letters to Fanny Kemble '' of
1895	DATE	, and the '' More Letters '' of
1901	DATE	.

		All these are now ar - ranged , as they should be for the best enjoyment of the reader , in chronological order , instead of the previous arbitrary groups , and occupy four of the seven volumes comprising the present edition .

		The remaining volumes contain the sum of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's published literary work and translations -- the `` little escapades in print , '' as he himself used to call them .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's introduction to the collected edition of
1889	DATE	and his elucidative passages and notes in the Letters are reprinted here , but otherwise the editorial matter is almost entirely
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's own .

		The external setting of the edition is irreproachable in nearly all details , the cfe Itixe character being main - tained without loss of simplicity or dignity .

		Possibly the binding might be considered a trifle too ornate to accord with the sober genius of '' old Fitz '' ; but it is no less striking and effective on that account .

		Each volume contains a frontispiece portrait in photogravure .

		Unless the letters to James Sped - ding should miraculously come to light , this must remain the final edition of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's complete writings .

		It was Lecky who said that the tri - ttnd ' '' `` bii ^ ` t ^ ih ^ ^ P ^ ^ o * sanitary science form per - haps the brightest page in the history of our century , and Lord Derby who held that sanitary instruction is even more important than sanitary legislation .

		Those who wish to read of the successes of this branch of applied biology , and those who seek instruction in the art of sanitary living in matters of personal and public hygiene , will find Professor
William T. Sedgwick	PERSON	's ''
Prin	PERSON	- ciples of
Sanitary Science	ORGANIZATION	and Public Health '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a most complete and satisfactory treatise .

		The writer for many years has been the biologist of the
Massachusetts State Board of Health	ORGANIZATION	, and has rendered public service in matters of water supplies , sewage disposal , and other phases of public hygiene under municipal or state control , unsurpassed for the scientific thoroughness with which the work has been done .

		This book is written with special reference to the causation and preven - tion of infectious diseases , and presents in simple and logical form the fundamental scientific prin - ciples on which the great practical arts of modern sanitation securely rest .

		It is the outcome of a course of lectures delivered to engineers , chemists , biol - ogists , and architects , at the
Massachusetts Insti	ORGANIZATION	-
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 205 tnte of Technology ; and its illastrationg are drawn largely from the antbor 's experience in dealing with problems of sanitation .

		It treats the subject broadly , dealing with the basic principles underlying the phi - losophy of cleanness , rather than their immediate application , and while it is thoronghly scientific it is by no means too technical for the intelligent reader .

		It treats of the nature of infections and contagions diseases , and the means of their dissemination and control , of toxins and antitoxins , and of asepsis and antisepsis , with simplicity and clearness .

		Not only will physicians and municipal engineers find the work of great value , but its presence in every in - stitution and school and home would do much to lessen the risk of disease and death , and serve in no small measure to correct some popular and all too-prevalent fallacies concerning the nature and cause of diseases , and the necessity of preventative measures for the protection of the individual and the community .

		An admirable treatise on `` Title Pages , '' by Mr.
Theodore L. De	PERSON	-
Vinne	PERSON	, is published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book , which belongs to a series on the practice of typography , by one who is a master of the art , is like a spring of cool water in a dry land , or a good blast of common-sense in the weary waste of sentimental disquisitions about printing which has been so abundant of late from amateurs and pretenders .

		Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	divides his treatise into three parU -- Historical , Practical , and Critical , which makes a very nice set of distinctions ; and it has , furthermore , no less than twenty-three pages of index for four hundred of reading-matter .

		The text of a treatise on title-pages of course deals with type and other allied subjects ; and Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	writes of them all in a style that is clear and sane , -- qualities evidently due to that perspective and sense of proportion which come from long study and familiarity with a subject , and a conviction of its importance and interest .

		At the end is a title - page in ten different styles , showing the varieties of treatment possible .

		The illustrations are numerous , and fully carry out the clear expository character of the text .

		The treatise will be found indispensable to all in any way connected with the making of books , while its interest will not be confined to these , but will extend to all who have any taste or fancy in typography .

		If dealing with any one but a very ^ ^ ^ ^ J ^ ^ ^ ^ famous personage .

		Miss
Agnes Grace Weld	PERSON	's slender volume of reminis - cences -- '' Glimpses of
Tennyson	PERSON	and Some of his Relations and Friends '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- -- would hardly be entitled to hearty commendation .

		But the theme , rather than the treatment , invests these four short chapters with undeniable interest .

		Miss `` Weld 's mother was Mrs.
Tennyson	PERSON	's sister , and the niece by marriage enjoyed an intimacy with the poet that could hardly have been greater had she been a blood relation .

		Though showing us less of Tennyson the man than of Tennyson the poet , the writer touches on some of his less familiar qualities .

		His artistic taste and skill are attested by the cover of the book , which bears a spray of ivy as carved by him from nature .

		The design was employed in the decorative terra-eotta moulding around the windows of a model cottage on his es - tate .

		To his young niece the poet gave a solemn charge to let the world know '' how great a sacri - fice '' he had made in accepting , at Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's pressing entreaty , the offered peerage .

		The devout side of his nature receives fresh illustration in these pages .

		The freedom of the human will and the starry heavens he considered the two greatest of marvels .

		Pointing to a recently felled horse-chestnut tree that still put forth its blossoms , he likened it '' to some men who appear blooming outwardly whilst they are already dead within . ''

		His going down on his knees to kindle a fire for a newly arrived guest , and his haste to answer the letter of a frenzied German who threatened to kill himself unless he secured the poet 's autograph before a certain date , illustrate the simple human kindness of the man .

		Reminiscences of
Charles	PERSON	and
Horatio Tennyson	PERSON	, Mrs.
Cameron	PERSON	,
Edward Bowen	PERSON	and his brother , ``
W. G. Ward	PERSON	, and other of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's relatives and friends , give added value to the little book , which is rendered still further attractive by some interesting portraits and an ap - pendix containing selections from the late
Bertram Tennyson	PERSON	's privately printed prose and verse .

		Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	, a
FhUadel	ORGANIZATION	- phia ophthalmologist , has written a little book on • ' Biographic Clinics '' -LRB- Blakiston -RRB- , that should prove a veritable eye - oi > ener , in more senses than one .

		A pathological study of the lives of DeQaincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	, leads the author to the con - clusion that their recorded physical ailments were largely due to eye-strain , resulting from astigmatism and easily curable at any time by spectacles of the right kind .

		It was not opium , he feels assured , that so nearly wrecked DeQaincey 's life , but defective vision .

		Study thus brought on other disorders , and opium probably saved his life , instead of almost kill - ing him as the '' Confessions '' would lead one to in - fer .

		Stress is laid on the theory of reflexes .

		The eye , an all-important and most delicate organ , shifts , if it can , the penalty of its abuse on to other and less delicate organs .

		Until recently the real cause of countless cases of headache , dyspepsia , insomnia , biliousness , etc , remained unsuspected .

		Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	is duly honored as the one who ,
thirty years ago	DATE	, first recognized the pathologic significance of astigmatism .

		A more than pathologic significance , according to
Liebreich	PERSON	, the
Berlin	LOCATION	ocalist , attaches to it in the case of the artist
Turner	PERSON	, the peculiar char - acter of whose pictures is thought to be due to the painter 's astigmatism ; so that if these pictures were viewed through proper astigmatic lenses , their Turn - erism would vanish .

		The lay reader queries whether Dr.
Gould	PERSON	does not push his theory pretty far ; but 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, at any rate his book is suggestive and helpful .

		A very beneficent , practical application of his ideas would be , as he points out , the printing of all books , were it feasible , in white ink on black paper , and also the doing away with gaudy gilt picture-frames .

		Eye - strain would thus be materially lessened .

		An account of Rev.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	, whose Unitatianism occasional writings on matters of in
Amerxca	LOCATION	.

		church and religion in
America	LOCATION	have given indication of his capacity to grapple with these themes on a larger scale , has at last completed his history of '' Unitarianism in
America	LOCATION	, '' which he had originally intended to bring out three years ago , at the time of the seventy-fifth anniversary celebration of the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	, by which body the book is now published ; but the task of preparing the work was too great to admit of its earlier appearance .

		Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	was neither born a Unitarian , nor was Unitarianism thrust upon him .

		He achieved it by struggle and search .

		Conse - quently he is well fitted to act as guide to other inquirers .

		He wisely chooses to dwell rather on what Unitarianism concretely is and what are its fruits , than on the theological controversies that marked its birth and early history .

		Hence he de - votes large portions of his book to such matters as Sunday-school work , missions , reforms , philanthro - pies , education .

		Unitarian men and women , and Unitarianism in literature .

		Our early and middle nineteenth-century literature presents such a pre - ponderance of Unitarian writers that they would seem to be more readily designated by noting ex - ceptions than by giving a list .

		Other departments of worthy activity are almost equally rich in men and women of that liberal faith that so naturally prompts to good works and broad philanthropy .

		The book is a most serviceable manual of reference , and as a record of Unitarian achievement in Amer - ica it supplies a want never before so satisfactorily filled .

		The last century has witnessed as - Mdaga ^ tounding strides in the science of phi - lology ; and perhaps in no branch of it has such progress been made as in the investi - gation of the old languages of
Southwestern Asia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Arthur John Booth	PERSON	, in `` The Discovery and Decipherment of the Trilingual Cuneiform Inscrip - tions '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , retells the story of
Rawlinson	ORGANIZATION	's great feat in 1835-1846 .

		He prefaces this , how - ever , by two long chapters giving an account of the principal explorers of the
Babylonian Valley	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	, beginning with
1472	DATE	A.D. .

		Here we find several incidents of value that have not been noticed by modern writers .

		Mr.
Booth	PERSON	aims to give the reader a definite idea of the contribution made by each traveller to the final and culminating task of reading the ancient languages of
Persia	LOCATION	.

		To most scholars , especially to the archseologists , these first two chapters will be of most value .

		The remainder of the book is a rehearsal of matter already well known to scholars and amply spread before the pub - A myxiical interpretation oj Omar .

		lie in several popular works .

		The older literature has been utilized , and the author 's method of treat - ment indicates that be is not handling the inscrip - tions as an expert .

		The publishers ' catalogue of forty pages bound up with the book is in question - able taste .

		, Mr.
C. H. A. Bjerregaard	PERSON	, the li - brarian of the New York Public Li - brary , and a well-known authority on mystical and oriental subjects , has provided the material for the large volume entitled '' Sufi Inter - pretations of the Quatrains of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	and FitzGerald '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Necessarily , the labor and erudition which have gone into the mak - ing of this work are to be appreciated only by those who possess in some degree the mystical tempera - ment .

		The language in which
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's pellucid stanzas are clothed have for such readers an inter - pretation far beyond the ordinary meaning of lan - guage , either prosaic or poetic .

		The universe and its most abstruse problems , the intricacies of all philos - ophy and morality , and the curious learning of re - condite thinkers through many ages , are woven into the Rub ^ iy ^ t as Mr.
Bjerregaard	PERSON	reads them ; and he discloses all these things to those who care for and can understand them .

		The translator 's aim has been the production of a version '' which should be as helpful to the student as an ordinary prose crib and more easily remembered . ''

		The translation is faithful and not unpleasing , and the lines are numbered accord - ing to those of

		Mr.

		This is a most agreeable part of
Burr	PERSON	's life to those who regret the later clouds that injured his reputation .

		Mr.

Greeley	PERSON	since he died ; in fact , since
Parton	PERSON	's book appeared , just before the civil war , no one has under - taken a comprehensive life of

		Greeley 's own autobiography , which he called `` Recollections of a Busy Life , '' has been the only later work of note to which readers could go , and that book has not been in general circulation for a great many years .

		I In our days , fame is more quickly attained than in times past .

		It is safe to say that the future historian of our age will not have to record the sad fact which must be recorded of the many past ages , that its greatest men have lived in obscurity , and that to their names none but posthumous fame has been attached .

		Not that genius is sure of immediate recognition now , but that it is much more likely to secure it than in times past .

		Given to-day a man of intellectual power , endowed with good vitality , and having a fair amount of self-assertion , he need not remain neglected unless he choose .

		If he have anything to say which is worth the world 's attention , he can secure it , as a rule , without waiting too long for it .

		Of course a man of genius may die young as well now as ever before , and receive the recognition due him when too late , but with a moderately long life he can count upon securing an audience to some extent commensurable with his ambition , during that lifetime .

		The judgments of no age concerning itself are to be taken as wholly conclusive .

		It may well be that posterity will place different esti - mates from ours upon the work of many of the men of our age , but the general truth remains that these judgments of ours , taken as a whole , more closely approximate to those which will receive the sanction of posterity than the judg - ments of past ages concerning themselves have approached the final estimate of mankind .

		This statement is obviously insusceptible of proof , but it is possible to point out strong rea - sons for believing it to be substantially true .

		There are two chief reasons why genius in times past has often received only the tardy recogni - tion of posterity .

		It has either failed to present itself fairly to the attention of its age , or , if this has been secured , its embodiment , thus pre - sented to the world for judgment , has been so far in advance of the age in which it has appeared that it has not been understood , and has found meaning only to the advanced intelligence of some later period .

		The first of these causes may be said to have been very largely done away with , so largely as no longer to prevail in any marked degree in depriving a person of the re - cognition due to his achievements .

		The second cause of course remains as before , but we shall find upon examination that it is of much less consequence than the first , for the cases are few in which thought , once brought well before the attention of an age , has not been able to secure an audience , if a small one , among the most advanced thinkers of the age , while there are countless instances in which thought has been prevented from exercising its due influence by lacking the means of bringing itself into gen - eral notice , and the prevalence of error has thereby been made possible , although the truth may have been fully known to a few .

		Briefly , then , our age has witnessed so mar - 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, vellous an increase in the facilities for inter - course and the interchange of ideas that it would be a difficult matter for any expression of unusual ability to remain long unnoticed , and that any such expression , once brought to the attention of a large public , could hardly be so far in advance of that public as not to find some few capable of estimating it at its real value , and assigning it the place fitting it in the structure of human achievement .

		The most universally accepted opinions of an age are really the opinions of a few of the clearest thinkers of that age , supported blindly by the great mass of people , who always have been and always will be incapable of forming valid judgments for themselves on any of the more abstract subjects of thought with which an age is called upon to deal .

		Now the conditions of our present age are such that not only is the expression of new thought practically sure of whatever audience the age can furnish it with , but also that the few or many who are found capable of appreciating it are enabled to give their judgment more immediate effect in direct - ing the general judgment of the age than would be possible were the means of intercourse less numerous than they are .

		In consequence of all this our age has witnessed many unwonted spectacles , among them that of a man of sci - entific genius who , less than half a century ago , propounded a theory that seemed the height of speculative extravagance to all but the few of clear vision whose attention was called to it , a theory that was opposed to all the preexisting opinions on the subject with which it dealt , and had to encounter , perhaps , a greater amount of conservative resistance than was ever before en - countered by any theory , yet which , in spite of all obstacles , has in this less than half a cen - tury acquired for itself a place in biology an - alogous to that occupied by the law of gravi - tation in physics , and has revolutionized the sciences of organic life .

		Similarly , in the do - main of art , we have seen a composer of genius boldly reject the accepted canons of musical composition , denounce as trivial that which was generally looked upon as being truest and highest , and , striking out for himself in a new and little explored path , create a music as widely at variance with existing fashion as might well be , claiming for music and conquer - ing in her name a wider province than that over which she had previously held sway , and all this in the face of the most determined op - position , an opposition which made unscrupu - lous use of all the weapons that came to hand .

		and was ^ unsparing of ridicule , that most potent appeal of the vulgar to the vulgar ; this also we have seen , and we can record with satisfac - tion that the man to whose untiring activity it was all due lived to see realized the proudest dream of his life , and died with no mere cer - tainty of posthumous fame , such as might have been his sole portion in an earlier age , but having seen the triumph of his work , having received during life the crown of recognized success .

		In view of these considerations it may be maintained that the oft-repeated assertion that the men and work of an age can only be judged fairly by a succeeding one has become divested of whatever truth it may once have had , and , in support of this , there may be instanced the many cases in which new thoughts and crea - tions have received what we have no reason to believe to be other than a permanent valuation in the very age which has given them birth .

		The sad history of genius in past ages seems to have produced a sort of conviction that , of necessity , it must ever be so with great men and great ideas ; a conviction which does not pause to inquire into the conditions which have hitherto made this history what we know it to have been , or to ask if they obtain now as they have in the past .

		That the judgments of our age in many matters of theory are of no merely provisional nature , but such as we may con - fidently accept as in no danger of being re - versed , is sufficiently clear , for they appeal directly to the reasoning faculties , and the reason once satisfied , the matter is ended , for , in the words of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, '' so long indeed as the truth does not appear , error will have full play , as owls and bats fly about in the night ; but we may sooner expect that owls and bats will frighten back to its bed the orient sun , than that truth , once recognized and clearly enunciated , will be pushed aside in order that the old error may resume its place .

		For in this is the very strength of truth , that her victory is indeed gained hardly and at much cost , but , once gained , is never to be taken from her . ''

		The permanence of our aesthetic judgments is more open to dispute , for in these matters the canons of criticism have not the immu - table character possessed by those employed in abstract reasoning , and yet it may be asserted with some confidence that even in matters of this kind we are not without being justified in the assumption that , with due exercise of the greater care made imperative by the more com - plex conditions dealt with , we may arrive at
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		231 eonclasions which shall have an objective va - lidity .

		The idea is gradually taking hold of men 's minds that aesthetic judgments are more than opinions : that there is a right and a wrong in art , and that this may be clearly pointed out ; that we may have an intellectaal recognition of the value of a poem or a picture which shall be something apart from and quite different from our personal likings , which may indeed be wholly opposed to them .

		If this as - sumption be not unwarranted we may proceed to the study of the artistic no less that of the scientific manifestations of the present , with some confidence that we may , with due care , form estimates which shall be of more than subjec - tive value .

		Had Shakespeare lived in the nine - teenth century instead of in the sixteenth , we may rest assured that he would have found an appreciative audience , and one whose verdict would only have become confirmed by the cen - turies following .

		It is , of course , this Tery confirmation which sets the seal upon such a verdict , but for those who returned it , it would have needed no such confirmation .

		It may , of course , be urged that we are all children of our age , and that this alone makes it impossible for us to judge objectively of pro- ductions which appeal not only to our intellect but to our feelings .

		This plea has a certain force , but it is the very recognition of the fact that we are the children of our age , and the clear perception of the characteristics of that age , which will be our best safeguard , for it will afford us a criterion by which we may dis - tinguish the objective in our personal estimate from the subjective .

		Most people place a Talue upon works of art according as they are interested by them .

		This valuation is purely subjective and worthless .

		Above these there is a lesser number of those who , imbued with the spirit of their age .

		judge works of art favorably or unfavorably according as they give expression to that spirit .

		This judgment has in the place of the subjectivity of the indi - vidual the larger subjectivity of the age , and has a high relative value , but may be reversed by another generation .

		Highest of all we find the few who , while carried along in the current of the thoughts and aims of their age , keep their heads above the level of the stream , and realize its relations to the past and the future .

		These are of their age , but they see beyond it : they have a sense of the unity of past , present , and future ; their judgment is more or less objective , and has a correspond - ingly high absolute value .

		* A few unpublished letters and an army offi - cer 's manuscript account of a South African campaign , eked out with material from contem - porary memoirs and magazines , and all gener - ously embellished with reproductions of por - traits and curious prints , have furnished forth a volume of considerable interest in Mr.
George Paston	PERSON	's '' Side-Lights on the Georgian Period . ''

		The first chapter , `` A Burney Friendship , '' treats of the friendly relations and correspond - ence between the Burneys and
Mary Ann Port	PERSON	, who afterward became Mrs.
Waddington	PERSON	.

		The latter 's granddaughter , Mrs.
Herbert	PERSON	of Llan - over , has placed the letters at the author 's dis - posal , and from these , as well as from
Madame D' Arblay	ORGANIZATION	's published `` Diary and Letters , '' Mr.
Paston	PERSON	has given us a pleasing , although rather stiff and old-maidish , portrait of the talented au - thor of `` Evelina . ' ''

		One of

		Colonel Manners , is introduced for our amusement .

		The simple-hearted Colonel com - plained that whenever he was about to speak on any topic in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Pitt	PERSON	invariably anticipated him and went through the whole subject so thoroughly as to leave others nothing to say .

		He declared he had never voted but once against his conscience , and that was for the '' bacheldors ' tax , '' which he held to be unconstitutional ; for , he asks , '' how can a man help being a bacheldor if no - body will have him ?

		And , besides , it 's not any fault to be taxed for , because we did not make ourselves bacheldors , for no one was born mar - ried , so we were made bacheldors by God . ''

		And ao we dismiss him with the punning couplet , -- `` Gentle Manners , with affections mild , In wit a man , simplicity a child . ''

		Mrs.
Carew	PERSON	, daughter of Dr.
Burney	PERSON	's early friend and patron ,
Fulke Greville	PERSON	, and one of the famous beauties of her time , is praised for her youthful charm even as a middle-aged ma - tron with grown-up children .

April 1	DATE	^ her father .

		Here is one of his written at the age of eighty-three to Mrs.
Waddington	PERSON	: `` My Dearest Madam , -- The Median and Persian laws by which I at present exist are the following : I never quit my bower till twelve o'clock , when , in toler - able weather , I take an old lady 's drive about
Hyde Park	LOCATION	, and in
summer	DATE	walk in
Kensington Gardens	LOCATION	till near two -- then devote the third hour to calling on dear friends who interested themselves about my health during my confinement by personal inquiries at my door without being let in -- and since the few warm days that succeeded our Nova Zembla frigidity , set me up , and en - abled me to go into my parlour , or chambre d'audience , I gave notice to the elect ladies ou my list that I should be visible from three to five o'clock , after which I dine , read , or hear reading , and write or dictate letters , but never more will be out after sunset .

		But I have a trick of waking at sunrise , and if not in acute pain , read or write in bed till ten or eleven o'clock .

		Such is the monotonous life of your very old and affectionate servant ,
Chakles Burney	PERSON	. ''

		The good doctor , writing of
Catalini	ORGANIZATION	's singing , dwells only on its merits , leaving its defects for others to censure . ''

		Praise is harder than finding fault , '' he says , and wisely chooses the more difficult part .

		He deprecates the giving of so enormous pay -LRB- two hundred pounds for each performance -RRB- to the prima donna , and foresees the evils of the star system .

		The gentle doctor of music was said to be the only man to whom Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	had ever uttered the words , '' I beg your pardon , sir . ''

		In the second chapter , on `` The Illustrated Magazine , '' attention is called to the curious fact that the recent rise of the pictorial monthly is but a repetition of what took place a hun - dred years earlier .

		Between
1765	DATE	and
1800	DATE	a group of illustrated magazines sprang into being which compare not unfavorably with their modern successors in
England	LOCATION	, albeit eclipsed by American publications of a similar kind .

		But even their names are now unfa - miliar .

		How many readers have ever heard of The Town and Country Magazine , The Westminster , The Oxford , The Sentimental , The Maccaroni , The Matrimonial , The Lady 's , The Fashionable , or The Magazine a la Mode ?

		Dull enough , to be sure , their reading matter would now seem to us ; but their copper-plate engravings are a relief to the eye wearied by an excess of process prints .

		Akin in interest to the foregoing , but dis - cussed in a later chapter , is the literary review .

		Mention is made chiefly of The Monthly Re - view -LRB- 1749-1845 -RRB- and its shorter-lived rival , The Critical Review -LRB- 1766-1791 -RRB- .

		To the Monthly 's fine-print list of less important pub - lications the reviewer , with almost invariable lack of prophetic wisdom , relegated the books that afterward achieved fame .

		The editor .

		Dr.
Griffiths	PERSON	, meets with scant respect from Mr.
Pas	PERSON	- ton , who refers slightingly to his title with the ex - planation that '' he had some American diplo - oma . ''

		As a matter of fact , it was the Univer - sity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	that , unsolicited , conferred upon him the degree of LL.D. , of which we may conclude that he was not wholly unworthy , as ^ honorary degrees go ; for the author admits that he was reputed a firm friend , a lover of domes - tic life , a steady advocate of literature , an ex - cellent companion , and a veritable encyclopaedia of literary anecdote and reminiscence .

		As one of the pioneers in a useful department of literature , he certainly deserves honor and praise , whatever the shortcomings of his mag - azine .

		And he seems not to have miscon - ceived the function of a critical review .

		No present-day
London	LOCATION	editor could state the case more tersely than did the Monthly in the fol - lowing reply to an aggrieved author : '' The design of our work is mistaken by such as - suppose it to be the business of the reviewers to set every wrong-headed author right .

		They think it in gen - eral sufficient that they point out the principal defects - in the performance of such mistaken writers , who would do well , instead of persisting in their errors , and growing impatient under well-meant reproof , to sub - mit with patience , and profit by just correction . ''

		The ideal woman of the Georgian period seems to have been very nearly what the men demanded that she should be , -- `` fine by de - fect and amiably weak . ''

		The latter half of the eighteenth century abounded in manuals of advice to young women , written by old womea of both sexes .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	especially admired a little treatise by
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	's sister , in - culcating the principle that '' the love of praise in a female breast should never transcend th & domestic sphere ; perhaps the most perfect fem - inine mind aims at nothing higher than an ex - emption from blame . ''

		Let those who pine for woman 's complete emancipation review the progresss achieved in one short century , and take courage .

		From the now forgotten autobiography of Mrs.
Eliza	PERSON	-LRB-
Dawson	PERSON	-RRB-
Fletcher	PERSON	, whom the au - thor styles an
English Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	, one gets a fresh glimpse of eighteenth-century people and manners .

		Here is Miss
Edgeworth	PERSON	's portrait , sketched with no flattering hand : ''
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	's personal appearance is not at - tractive , but her vivacity , good humour , and cleverness in conversation quite equalled my expectations .

		I should say she was more sprightly than refined ; she excelled in the raoiness of Irish humour , but the great defect of her manner was an excess of compliment , or what in
Ireland	LOCATION	is called ' blarney ' ; and in one who
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 2SS had moved in the best circles it surprised me a little .

		She repelled all approach to intimacy on my part by the excess of her complimentary reception when we were first introduced to each other .

		I never felt con - ^ denee in the reality of what she said afterwards . ''

		The author takes occasion unnecessarily to signify his disapproval of pro-Boer sentiments and his low estimate of the Boer character .

		He drags in a chapter entitled '' The South Afri - can War , '' with extracts from a manuscript by Sir
John Malcolm	PERSON	, an officer in the
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	campaign of
1795	DATE	.

		He informs us that '' his - tory repeats itself -- more especially in
South Africa	LOCATION	. '' '

		The only repetition apparent lies in the British passion for dominion and in
John Ball	LOCATION	's disregard of the other man 's territorial rights .

		The narrative , toward the close , runs a little thin and watery , the final pages giving a sus - picion of space-writing .

		So hard-pressed is the author for matter at last that bis concluding chapter , `` An American in
England	LOCATION	, '' is made up of extracts from so well-known a book as the life and letters of
George Ticknor	PERSON	, from which he culls many of the anecdotes long ago used by
Whipple	PERSON	and other reviewers of the work .

		In this case , therefore , it can hardly be .

		The Social Unrest .

		* One 's first thought on finishing a perusal of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's volume on `` The Social Unrest '' is : Why was not such a book written some time ago ?

		A second and more deliberate opin - ion is , that this is the most satisfactory book in the field of social study for many a day , and that its production is a supreme accomplish - ment .

		Such a book , with its careful investi - gation , its temperate view of every side of a dispute , its large sympathy , its recognition of the evolutionary order of things , makes such widely blazoned works as those of
Kidd	PERSON	seem very empty of the solid matter of which the real world is composed , and brings into notice , by very force of contrast , the unsubstantiality of much of the so-called social science of the day .

John Oiaham Brooks	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Tha Ifamrillaa Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		on the heels of the greatest industrial upheaval in history , is very timely .

		The purpose of the book may be expressed in the words with which the third chapter opens .

		It is '' to analyze the nature of our own social anre `` t ; to mark some of its more undeniable tendencies ; to aak if it is growing , or , if not growing , is it taking on any threatening peculiarity to justify alarm ?

		Can it be maintained that ours is an unrest different in any essen - tial from the ferment which for centuries has stirred the heart and the imagination of humanity ?

		In the current literature on social and industrial questions nothing , even by economists of repute , is more com - i monly asserted . ''

		> Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	partly refutes and partly endorses this assertion in the suggestion that '' if the people of any past century had possessed our machinery for telling and spreading their fears , their gossip , their corruptions , their tragedies , they would appear to us like a people of whom we had never heard .

		This new facility for the utterance of our com - plaints becomes also a cause of the eviL To insist loudly and incessantly that things are ill , is to help make them so , although there is some hope that the sheer din of the caviller may tend at last to beget insensibility and iodifferenoe , as exoesuTe advertis - ing may sometimes defeat itself by its dreary unirer - sality . ''

		As an explanation of the increasing unrest , stress is laid on the altered circumstances in this country where the chances for common - place and average ability are becoming less and less , as those for special ability become greater and greater .

		`` Three acres and a cow '' translated into the vocabulary of the working man no longer means comfort as it did a gen - eration or so ago .

		The standard of living , in - terpreted by '' a living wage , '' has been as im - perious a tyrant as the worst type of indus - trial master . ''

		Workingmen , and more especially their wives , who hare once gained the income of modest comfort , have something to lose , upon which great price is set , and therefore organize , strike , and struggle , often in most regrettable ways , to maintain that standard .

		... It is the sense of insecurity , lest these symbols of getting on in the world may at any time be lost , that is at present , as it is long likely to remain , one of the deepest and most justifiable sources of discontent .

		Nothing is so habitu - ally ignored , in attempts to understand industrial strug - gles , as the force and preralenee of this sentiment . ''

		Other causes are found in the spread of popu - lar education with the consequent democratic ideas , and in the decay of authority in religion .

		One rebel said to the writer : '' The successful classes have used religion and heaven to keep the peace and to put off a lot of troublesome duties . ''

		But it is in the presentation and valuation of the determining causes of the present social un - 234 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
April 1	DATE	, rest that the interest of this treatise lies .

		These are found in the practical working conceptions of the contract of labor and of the ownership of the agencies used by labor respectively en - tertained by the masters and the men .

		On the one side is the growing perception that the contract of labor is not unilateral in its obliga - tions but equilateral , and that the product of the combined effort of master and laborer , put back into the hands of the former in the shape of machinery , is a trust for society rather than a Trust for promotors : on the other is the re - luctance of 80 many potent agents in produc - tion to concede that '' the old order changeth , '' and to recognize that restrictions on appren - tices merely parallel protective tariffs and pri - vate restrictions on output , and that unions are the reflex action of combinations .

		In the chapter entitled '' Man and Society versus Machinery '' the fight against the ma - chines is shown to be the inevitable result of social awakening and progress , and not in reality a fight against the machines but one for participation in their control .

		Either this con - trol must be shared or else they become a veritable car of Juggernaut before which the people perish .

		The chapter on '' The Master Passion of Democracy , '' under the sub-titles of `` illusions '' and `` realities , '' admirably pre - sents the limitations and the possibilities of the hoped-for equality .

		The former portion easily disposes of the Utopian theories , from
Kousseau	LOCATION	to
Bellamy	LOCATION	, which ignore the realities of human nature . ''

		The origin of many of the most startling inequal - ities is biological .

		To get born with certain qualities is to have many chances to one against the man who came into life without them .

		We all see that the sources of superiority are in the gifts that can not be made equal .

		The mysteries of temperment , buoyancy , vivid imagination , prudence , charms of personality , tact , inflexible purpose , steadiness of self-control , and even physical gifts , like good digestion and ability to sleep , are qualities that lead men beyond the average of their fellows .

		To put the least check upon these distinctions -LRB- or inequalities -RRB- would bring a common and a grievous loss . ''

		On the other hand : '' Let us state again what is deepest in this un - abating purpose of the demos .

		It is not for absolute or external equalities .

		It is not for any equality that will submit to nice measurement .

		It is for far more equality than exists .

		It is for as much equality as each is capable of seizing and using to his own and others ' good . ''

		Three consecutive chapters on `` Socialism in the Making , '' '' From Revolution to Reform , '' and '' Socialism at Work '' lead us on from the educational value of socialism as further - ing self-help to the admirable results already achieved in
Belgium	LOCATION	by '' municipal trading . ''

		The writer has , prior to these chapters , called attention to the growing demand in this country for municipal ownership of public works and all public services , as a sign of the times which capital would do well to heed .

		If the choice is to continue to be between such one-interest management as has characterized the anthra - cite coal fields and public ownership , it is easy to believe that the working man 's vote will bring in the latter .

		One of the most valuable features of the book is the frequent citation of capitalist opinion on the side of the thesis for equality and trusteeship which the writer maintains .

		Recognition that the trade union has come to stay and that it is far better for the masters to cooperate than to fight it is frequent .

		A growing sense of cor - porate and personal responsibility is one of the marked features of today , and Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	gives it due credit .

		In this recognition , ex - tending to the union as the complemental force in social organization , he sees the escape from that ending most to be deprecated -- the `` so - cialism of the school . ''

		That he takes no idyllic view of the union the following indict - ment evidences : '' The sin and the weakness of the trade union has been , in its attitude toward the non-union man ; in its sullen aversion to new inventions ; in its too willing as - sent to check the output of work ; in its tendency to discourage the best endeavor among the better and stronger workers ; in its too free use of the sympathe - tic strike ; in a far too reckless use of the boycott . ''

		And yet he says with as full conviction : '' We have only to humiliate what is best in the aspirations of the trade union , and then every worst feature of socialism is fastened upon us .

		There is no danger in socialism that for a moment compares with that part of its working propaganda dear to the ex - tremists -- the class struggle .

		To make men believe in the fatalities of this social warfare is the deadliest work in which any human being can engage .

		To make men disbelieve it , by organizing agencies through which the luminous proof appears that men can do their work together with good will rather than hatred in their hearts , is as noble a service as falls to us in this world . ''

		This last sentence is the keynote to the pur - pose of the man and of the book .

		The latter must be read throughout to appreciate its moderation , its charity , its broad inclusiveness , its close touch with both classes in the great industrial operation , its sensible suggestion of practical and immediate attempts to help to shape the social evolution .

		J THE DIAL 235 The Diversions of a Biograpueb .

		* To the two volumes of '' Studies of a Biogra - pher '' issued in
1898	DATE	-LRB- reviewed in The Dial Vol .

		XXVI. , pp. 46-8 -RRB- , Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	has added a second series of two volumes .

		We hope that many more will follow .

		No one who is familiar with the first series , or with any of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's other works , -- including of course his contributions to '' The Dictionary of National Biography , '' -- needs to be told of the charm of these pages .

		The studies are not , in most cases , biographies in the ordinary sense ; the first word of the title should receive the main stress .

		They embody the keen ana - lytical criticism of life and character of one who has long been engaged in the proper study of mankind , and who evidently desires to be writ down in the company of Abou Ben Ad - hem .

		Mr.
St	PERSON	`` phen is not blind to the foibles of the writers whom he discusses ; and on oc - casion he can wield a pen sufficiently sarcastic .

		Yet he never lets us forget his kindly spirit ; nor does he ever indulge in sarcasm for the pure pleasure of it .

		He is never iconoclastic ; nor does he let enthusiasm run away with him -- unless it be '' In Praise of Walking , '' and there we are in full sympathy with him , exult - ing in '' the delightful sensation of indepen - dence and detachment , '' proud to belong to the noble company of those who get nearest to na - ture in a walking tour .

		In his criticism he has followed the via media .

		When his opinions dif - fer from those of others he expresses them with becoming -- even at times extreme , but never assumed -- modesty , and never dogmatically .

		As in the first volumes of these studies , the range of subjects is wide .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has not , however , drawn upon the eighteenth cen - tury , the period which he has so fully illumin - ated in one of the greatest of his works ; he rarely discusses the poets as such .

		Though he talks of
Donne	PERSON	, and
Southey	PERSON	, and
Milton	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, it is not so much of their poetry as of their views of life , of their politics , of their characters , that he chooses to speak to us .

		The ethical question involved in the publica - tion of the
Browning	PERSON	love-letters interests him , as does the problem of the literary relations of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	in the times of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and of
Kousseau	LOCATION	.

		In the matter of the
Browning	PERSON	letters , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	is not disposed to be severe on the younger Mr.
Browning	PERSON	for allowing their pub - * Stuoik8 of a Biooraphkb .

		lication .

		Indeed , he adduces some very good arguments to demonstrate the beneficent re - sults of making public this revelation of the communion of two great souls . ''

		The best books to read , as somebody has remarked upon such an occasion , are the books that ought never to have been written . ''

		The danger , he thinks , is that the publication of these letters is likely to set a precedent which will be abused ; '' that the habit of turning out the most private recept - acles will be encouraged without reason by the success of this particular performance . ''

		The validity of this objection , however , is a point of casuistry which he confesses himself unequal to settling .

		The elusive
Donne	PERSON	, whose life forms so cu - rious a psychological problem , naturally in - terests Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	.

		How far the excessively frank poetry of his early years , '' calculated to make
Archbishop Abbot	ORGANIZATION	's hair stand on end , '' represents genuine autobiography ; how much of '' Biathanatos '' he himself really believed ; how ''
Donne	PERSON	, the wit , the poet , and the courtier , was sublimated into the saint , and a burning and shining light of the Church , '' -- these are some of the problems with which he wrestles .

		The morbid constitution of
Donne	LOCATION	, he thinks , has a real affinity with latter-day pessimism . ''

		People sometimes talk as if pessimism were a new inrention .

		It is merely a new way of saying the old things .

		The good old hearty belief in the devil had certainly one advantage : it enabled a gloomy person to cover his misanthropical sentiments by an edifying mask .

		The conviction that man 's nature is corrapt , and that the great majority will be damned , enabled yoa to discharge your melancholy and yet ostensibly to believe that everything was for the best .

		Now that the deril has gone ont of fashion , the pessimist can not find even a verbal excuse for his mismanagements of
< Nature	ORGANIZATION	, ' and has to appear in his true character . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	may not be a thorough-going op - timist ; but it is pretty clear that he does not belong to the opposite school .

		Another interesting study is concerned with
Huxley	LOCATION	.

		Nominally a review of Mr.
Leonard Huxley	PERSON	's biography , this essay is an apprecia - tion of the great warrior for the truth , with an exposition of some points in his creed .

		That Huxley was a thoroughly religious man , there can be no longer any doubt ; indeed , it mast have surprised some readers of the biography that they could ever have believed otherwise .

		But bis creed was not milk for babes .

		His '' hatred of shams meant the refusal of a brave man to shut his eyes , and scorn of men who deliberately provide convenient bandages for the purpose . ''

		Brought face to face with the 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, facts of human folly and human suffering , he refused to seek refuge in dreams or in an amiable and comfortable optimism .

		He had no faith in hasty panaceas .

		The cosmic process has been going on for ages .

		The ethical progress of society depends on combating this process ; and '' the microcosm will have a long fight against the macrocosm . ''

		But in his home-life Huxley had felt the power of a sen - timent which '' explained to him the meaning of ' sanctity ' and ' responsibility , ' '' and which without doubt formed '' the source of the happiness and continued vigour which threw brightness over his career . '' ''

		New Lights on Milton '' is , in the main , an estimate of
Professor Raleigh	ORGANIZATION	's book , which Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	ranks high .

		Concerning
Milton	PERSON	himself , while doing him full justice , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has no illusions .

		Milton was as little as possible of a philosophic reasoner .

		He might have found a better way of escaping from the tyranny of Laud than '' the accept - ance of the harshest Puritanic dogmatism . ''

		He was an idealist who was too often blind to the facts of experience .

		He generalizes from a single case -- his own , -- and is right only when his case happens to be typical .

		And there can be no adequate excuse for the scur - rility in which Milton indulged , and which '' scandalized even his contemporaries . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	thinks the fierce indignation displayed in some of
Milton	LOCATION	's prose works might have been turned to better advantage .

		He discusses at some length , and with luminous effect , the difficulties encountered by
Milton	PERSON	in expound - ing his theodicy in `` Paradise Lost , '' and con - cludes that `` we are forced to justify admiration at the cost of condoning palpable absurdities .

		It becomes evident that we must rather seek to justify ourselves by showing what a surpas - sing power was manifested in spite of innumer - able trammels imposed by the task and by the conditions of thought which made his concep - tion of it inevitable . ''

		The most interesting paper , however , is the one entitled '' Shakespeare as a Man . ''

		In this Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	goes into the old question of how much we know respecting the author himself of the great plays , -- a question con - cerning which all possible shades of opinion have found expression , if not a skilled cham - pion .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	holds with
Herr Brandes	PERSON	, that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's spiritual history may be fairly induced from the plays and the poems , rather than with Mr.
Lee	PERSON	, who inclines to mimimize the value of such inferences .

		It is interesting to compare this paper with the little monograph on ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	, the Man '' which Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	published in
1900	DATE	.

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	concerned himself in part rather with certain facts regarding the exter - nals of the poet 's life ; but to some extent the two papers overlap .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	insists upon the essential soundness of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's morality .

		Shakespeare was a royalist , but not blind to the human side of the king ; in political and social sentiment a conservative -- a hater of mobs and riots , but strongly sensible of the injustice in society ; sound but tolerant and liberal in his moral philosophy ; a conformist in religion , but more liberal than orthodox Ang - licans .

		With most of these propositions , we fancy Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	agrees .

		He is certain that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was not a Puritan ; yet the poet had '' a profound sense of the mystery of the world and of the pettiness of the little lives that are rounded by a sleep . ''

		He believes
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to have been capable of
Romeo	ORGANIZATION	's passion , though the sonnets are not neces - sarily descriptive of any real passion ; and likewise capable of the feelings and beliefs of the pessimist .

		Yet Shakespeare had no defi - nite ethical system to inculcate .

		He was con - tent to take the world as it is .

		Keenly alive to every enjoyment , he kept his head ; resisted temptation ; and never forgot that although the struggle fascinates , '' when the energies decay the position which it has won loses its charm . ''

		In short , the poet was a marvellous blending of the passionate idealist with the man of the world , whose thorough delight in a seat in the chimney-corner in old age was not the least significant token of his wisdom .

		The other essays are hardly less interesting than those upon which we have touched .

		Criti - cism of this sort must be of the greatest use - fulness to the student of literature -- and of life -

		THE DIAL 237 and superficial order .

		The work before us , however , is of a different character .

		The au - thor has not written to satisfy a passing curi - osity : his attitude is that of an investigator , an explorer who has found an untravelled land .

		And the work he presents to us is such as only the scholar produces : it is a scientific state - ment of conditions and facts .

		In Professor
Frederiksen	PERSON	's book , the life of the Finnish people is studied and presented almost wholly from the point of view of the economist .

		The opening chapter , on the settle - ment and early history of the Duchy , while in - teresting , is too brief and general to satisfy the student of history .

		The political scientist will object to the closing chapter on similar grounds .

		But he who cares for the results of economic research will find much in this volume that is useful and suggestive .

		The work is largely statistical : the author 's purpose being to dis - cover and present the facts , he is somewhat re - luctant about drawing conclusions .

		For such a study .

		Professor
Frederiksen	PERSON	is peculiarly well prepared .

		For a time he was
Professor of Finance and Economics	ORGANIZATION	at
the University of Copenhagen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Several years ' resi - dence in the
United States	LOCATION	gave him an oppor - tunity to study industrial forces in the process of rapid development , and to learn a lesson in economic progress for which no other nation affords material .

		It should also be added that none but a Scandinavian can write intelligently on the subject chosen .


Finland	LOCATION	, both in its geology and in its civilization , is a continuation of the
Scandinavian Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		One-seventh of the population is Swedish ; and the Turanian Finns have , after many centuries of Swedish rule and civilizing influence , become largely Scandinavian in their manner of living and thinking .

		One who knows the rural problems of the
Northern Kingdoms	ORGANIZATION	understands some - thing of the conditions prevailing across the border .

		It should be added , further , that prac - tically all the available information as to the social and economic state of this part of the ■ Czar 's dominions is found in Swedish publica - tions .

		The work before us is that of a critic who both understands and sympathizes with the people of whom he writes .

		The problems discussed may be grouped into three classes : agrarian , industrial , and finan - cial .

		As the Finnish population is largely rural , agrarian conditions are discussed at con - siderable length .

		To the student of culture , such subjects as rural classes and land legis - lation are of great interest .

		Here mediaeval survivals and the creations of modem , even re - cent , times may be seen side by side .

		The peasant classes , while not so prosperous as the English or American farmers , are in every way superior to those of
Southern Europe	LOCATION	.

		There is much poverty among them , especially in the more remote districts , but nowhere as much as in the interior of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The soil is none too fertile : much of the surface is swampy , or otherwise untillable ; the climate is harsh ; on the whole , the lot of the peasant is a hard one .

		The author sees considerable progress along the lines of agricultural methods ; but here again the old and the new are found side by side : im - plements of the most primitive sort and modern machinery are often used on the same estate .


Finland	LOCATION	is not rich in minerals ; consequently mining and allied industries are not of great importance .

		But the conditions for the devel - opment of certain other industrial pursuits are excellent .

		Manufacturing is making progress , especially such as stands close to agriculture and forestry .

		Most important are the cream - eries , the saw-mills , and the pulp factories .

		The textile industries stand next to these .

		Particularly interesting is the chapter on commerce and navigation .

		The recent progress of the country furnishes incontestable proof that
Finland	LOCATION	is undergoing rapid commercial development .

		The whole foreign trade , which in
1836	DATE	amounted to only
eighteen millions of marks	MONEY	, had risen to a total of four hundred and sixty-eight millions in
1900	DATE	.

		The commercial marine is of some importance , but shows little progress .

		Imports are somewhat in excess of exports .

		On the whole , the author seems satisfied that the people of
Finland	LOCATION	are rapidly learning to put to the best use all the resources that nature has bestowed on their land .

		Education is general ; agriculture and the industrial arts show a con - siderable advancement : trade is increasing , and the financial situation of the country is excellent .

		As to the Russianization of the people , which many have feared , the author says : '' It has been well said , that the Finns , who for more than seven hundred years have not been made Swedish , during centuries when progress was much slower , and when the liberal character of the Swedish government did not provoke any great resistance , have no need to fear being Russianized . ''

		He does believe , however , that a close union with
Russia	LOCATION	in matters of commerce and finance would prove disastrous in many respects .

		Professor
Frederiksen	PERSON	's work appeared simul - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-

		A
Romance Ascribed	ORGANIZATION	to
Milton	LOCATION	.

		* In
1648	DATE	there was printed in
London	LOCATION	a prose romance of anonymous authorship written in
Latin	LOCATION	, and entitled '' Novae Solymse Libri Sex . ''

		It fell unnoticed from the press , and unnoticed has it remained for two hundred and fifty years , until now in the fulness of time , under the pious and enthusiastic if somewhat effusive care of an English clergyman , the Reverend
Walter Begley	PERSON	, it is again brought before the world , -- butonly in an English translation , and loaded down with polemical and opinionative editorial annotation .

		The story is a simple one , and , stripped of its didactic inter-chapters , could be reprinted in a hundred pages .

		Two young Englishmen , Politian and
Eugenius	PERSON	, brothers and students at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, run away from home and go upon their travels .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	they fall in with a talented and cultivated young Jew ,
Joseph	PERSON	, also upon his travels , but who has met with misad - venture .

		Him they befriend , and in his com - pany visit his native place , the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	, now recovered and occupied by the race of converted Jews , During their long sojourn here , there is opportunity for interminable talk .

		The modern reader will sometimes be interested ; more often , I fear , however wide his interests , he will be bored .

		If he is de - voted to seventeenth-century theology , he may pull through .

		The talk is partly the relation of past adventures , -- in part the antecedents or `` argument '' of the story , dealing , inter alia , with Sicilian banditti ; with the episode of
Philander-Philippina	LOCATION	, daughter of a Sicilian nobleman , who out of love for
Joseph	PERSON	dis - guises herself as a man and follows him to the

		But the book as a whole can not be called a great work .

		It is not so good as
Sidney	PERSON	's ``

		It is of sterner stuff than Lyly 's '' Euphues , '' -- but that has the advantage of time and language and historical curiosity .

		It has pleased the editor and translator to attribute the work to
Milton	LOCATION	.

		It may be so .

		I have not yet seen any reason for believing that attribution impossible .

		But the positive arguments for
Milton	ORGANIZATION	's authorship are to me singularly unconvincing .

		The gist of them seems to be given in the editor 's wondering ex - clamation , '' Who else in the period was capable of producing such a work ? ''

		I do not know .

		I should want to search through my Fuller , my
Aubrey	LOCATION	, and my Cooper 's '' Athenae Can - tabrigienses , '' before indulging in much guess - ing .

Wotton	PERSON	-LRB- bat he died long before 1 -LRB- 548 , and there would be other antecedent improbabili - ties -RRB- , perhaps
Phineas Fletcher	PERSON	; hardly
James Shirley	PERSON	: perhaps one of the
Cambridge Pla	ORGANIZATION	- tonists , like More ; perhaps , as has been sug - gested , some learned
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	of the age ; or , just possibly , some converted Hebrew living in
England	LOCATION	.

		But more likely it was none of these -LRB- there are strong objections to each -RRB- , but some unnamed buried genius of unknown class and conditions .

		As in the case of the numerous Elizabethan plays of anonymous authorship , the probability is that the work was by no well-known hand , but is merely a gem from the dark unfathomed caves of ocean .

		From in - ternal evidence -LRB- in no point absolutely de - cisive -RRB- , he was probably a schoolmaster , or at least an '' educator , '' a
Cambridge	LOCATION	man , an ac - complished Latinist , a political idealist , but also something of a political conservative -LRB- cf. I. , 300 , -- I am not sure that this is Miltonic -RRB- , a Puritan only in the moral sense , -- hardly so politically , -- and something of a metaphysician and theologian .

		The book as a whole shows none of
Milton	LOCATION	's architectonic power or of his skill as a literary craftsman .

		The editor thinks that it has the air of a belated college exercise , or that it dates from the
Horton	PERSON	years .

		To tell the truth , one does not expect so much didacticism from the
Milton	LOCATION	of this period , -- certainly not so much in connection with a creative and narrative theme like this .

		The Antocriticon , or Preface -LRB- II. , 244 ;
cf. I.	PERSON	, 298 ff . -RRB-

Milton	PERSON	, nor does the passage on horse - manship -LRB- II. , 1 -RRB- , nor that on suicide -LRB- II. , 17 -- cf. Par .

		Lost , X , 998 ff . -RRB-

		, nor various others .

		The question of the authorship of this work , or rather the question of its Miltonic author - ship is one of so much importance for literary history that one can not but hope that some competent philologer or some budding
Bentley	PERSON	will take it in hand and sift the evidence ac - cording to strict rule and method .

		As it is left here , it decidedly needs sifting .

		And now I shall have to say a word about this edition and its editor .

		His task has been a pions task , and one of large labor .

		With all its defects , he has conferred a service for which he deserves the gratitude of all students of seventeenth-century literature .

		He shows wide reading in remote and unknown authors .

		His translation is fluent and readable .

		But his book is badly planned ; his philological argu - ment is unmethodical , rambling , shifty , and perplexing , although hone `` t and frank ; while his annotations , like those of the late Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	, to whom this editor bears some re - semblance , are often irrelevant , cheap , thin , and intrusive .

		So that he has encumbered his text far more than he has elucidated it .

		I suspect him of being a Baconion -LRB- cf. II. , IQn , 21 , 342 -RRB- , -- and we all know how the minds of those who believe that
Bacon	PERSON	wrote
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are likely to work .

		Moreover , this publication is not com - plete as it stands .

		How well could we have spared , for the sake of a reprint of the original Latin text along with the translation , all of the editor 's creeping and intrusive notes and ex - cursuses !

		Again , in parts the translation is abridged without due notice to the reader -LRB- jR. g. II. , 14 ff. , 60 , etc. -RRB- .

		I find myself disagreeing with Mr.
Begley	PERSON	' '' argnments and methods in so many points that it is quite impossible to go into the matter in this space .

		Those who wish to test one or two of them are invited soberly and critically to inspect what they will find , for example , at voL L , pp. 58 bot .

		After a considerable delay , owing both to the length of the work and the difficulty of translation , the English version of Zola 's `` V ^ rit ^ '' has at last made its appearance .

		`` Truth , '' it will be remem - bered , is the third of the four gospels according to Zola . ''

		Fruitf ulness '' and `` Labor '' were its pre - decessors in the series ; '' Justice '' was to have been its successor .

		The present work was barely com - pleted when the author made his abrupt and tragic exit from the stage of life , and the final work which was to have constituted the keystone of the arch was left unshaped .

		We are told that it would have dealt with the ideal of justice in a large way , with '' social justice , equity as between class and class , man and man . ''

		Lacking that consummation of a noble undertaking , we must be contented to accept '' \ 6ni6 '' as the apotheosis of both truth and justice , for the work is consecrated to both these ideals in about equal measure .

		Its main theme is the

		The church is the subject of attack , not the army , and for this reason the abom - inable crime which affords the basis of the story is committed by an ecclesiastic instead of by an army officer .

Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	tragedy .

		Being a Jew , the victim draws upon him - self all the fury of the anti-Semitic agitation ; be - ing a schoolmaster , his condemnation is symbolical of the suppression of truth by all the forces of super - stition and obscurantism .

		In his dealings with the church , the author does not mince matters .

		He makes it the implacable enemy of enlightenment and human civilization ; he amplifies theVoltairean watchword Scrasez Vinfdme !

		warning , le clSricalisme , voilh I ` ennemi .

		This mode of attack will give much offense to moderate souls , and is only to be justified as a legitimate polemic arising from the exigencies of a particular situation , and designed to further a specific artistic purpose .

		The book is very long and very repeti - tious , yet its earnestness and its noble idealism save it from becoming wearisome , and carry us through its six hundred pages without much deadening of our interest .

		In the deeply-felt preface with which Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	introduces his translation , the author is spoken of as ''
Rousseau	PERSON	's foremost descendant , '' and his three gospels are said to occupy a place in the thought of to-day comparable to that occu - pied a hundred years ago by the three great works of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		This comparison is not altogether strained , for education and the constitution of so - ciety are the essential themes of both writers alike , and both bring to bear upon them an immense emo - tional force .


Rousseau	PERSON	believed with all his soul that the regeneration of society must be brought about by a rationalization of the educational pro- cess , and this is the programme which is preached with prophetic fervor by Zola 's '' Y6rii6 . ''

		One passage may be selected from the many of similar import to serve as an illustration . ''

		The village was so small that
Marc	PERSON	's doings could not at - tract much attention , and thus he was able to pursue his methods without any great interference .

		As a first step , he again got rid of all religious emblems , all pictures , copy books , and books in which the supernatural was shown tri - umphant , and in which war , massacre , and rapine appeared as ideals of power and beauty .

		He considered that it was a crime to poison a lad 's brain with a belief in miracles , and to set brute force , assassination , and theft in the front rank as manly and patriotic duties .

		Such teaching could only pro- duce imbecile enertia , sudden criminal frenzy , iniquity , and wretchedness .

		Marc 's dream , on the contrary , was to set pic - tures of work and peace before his pupils , to show sovereign reason ruling the world , justice establishing brotherliness among men , the ancient violence of warlike ages being con - demned , and giving place to agreement among all nations , in order that they might arrive at the greatest possible happi - ness .

		And having rid his class of the poisonous ferments of the past .

		Marc particularly instructed his pupils in civic mor - ality , striving to make each a citizen well informed about his country , and able to serve and love it , without setting it apart from the rest of mankind .

		Marc held that
France	LOCATION	ought no longer to dream of conquering the world by arms , but rather by the irresistible force of ideas , and by setting an example of so much freedom , truth , and equity that she would deliver all other countries and enjoy the glory of founding with them the great confederation of free and brotherly nations . ''

		We have thought more than once , while under the spell of Zola 's superb conception of what a school can accomplish for its community , of
Herr BjOrnson	PERSON	's treatment of the same theme in his great novel , '' Flags are Flying in Town and Harbor , '' a work which will be remembered along with `` V ^ rit ^ , '' among the forceful educational writings of our time long after the books have lost most of their interest as works of fiction .

		Just now , indeed , '' V ^ rit ^ '' will find its chief interest for readers in its enforcement of the lessons that
France	LOCATION	has learned , and other nations as well , from the case of
Alfred Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Zola has ex -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 pressed a fundamental trntb in his saying that ' * one single act of injastiee may sa #
Bce	ORGANIZATION	for a whole nation to be stricken with dementia and slowly die . ''

		Thonghtful Americans should find in this book a mnch-needed lesson for oar own country .

		Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	says in his preface : '' The world has known greater deeds of injustice than the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	ease , but never has it known -- and may it nerer agMn know -- such a widespread exhibition of mendacity , both so unscrupulous and so persevering , att `` nded too by the most amazing credulity on the part of nine-tenths of the French nation . ''

		We are compelled to say in all soberness that a very fair ptarallel to this case is offered by our own treatment of the Philippine iniquities .

		There is the same empty declamation about the honor of the army , the same unscrupulous official mendacity , and the same de - termination to suppress the truth and pwrrert the ends of justice .

		Unfortunately , we have thus far found no champion of truth and justice to compel us to face the facts of the situation , and to force the moral revulsion in which is our only hope of national salvation .

		The nation that can condone the murder of a Father Augustine -- to mention but a single instance -- or remain unaroused by such a crime , is debarred from any condemnation of the treatment of
Alfred Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	by our sister republic , or from any participation in the sympa - thies to which '' Y ^ rit ^ '' gives sach profound and forceful expression .

		Those readers who dislike sociological and relig - ious discussion in their fiction will find no cause to somplain of - ` Lady Rose 's Daughter . ''

		the latest novel by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		It is a story with - out a touch of formal didacticism , and its charm is of a nature to disarm even such an irreconcilable as Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		It is just a novel , and nothing more , a novel committed to no propaganda , and aiming at artistic effect alone .

		Its charm is not easy of analysis , for there is nothing partic - ularly striking in the types of character pre - sented , or in the invention of the plot .

		Such men and women figure in hundreds of current novels ; such relations as exist between them are the stock possession of writers of fiction .

		But the art is of a nature to compel our almost unqualified admira - tion , and we doubt if any other woman now living is capable of so subtle and sympathetic a series of studies in personality , of so unerring an artastae sense in every minute detail , or of such graceful , balanced , and , when the occasion requires it , im - passioned prose narrative .

		Certainly , this com - bination of qualities is most extraordinary , and .

		in the present instance , must be regarded as the fine flower of long years of a conscientious endeavor to attain perfection of workmanship .

		We feel safe in saying that no earlier book of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's pre - sents us with so masterly an example of portraiture as is given us in her latest heroine , or pages of such grave beauty as those in which are set the Italian and Swiss scenes that come near the close of the novel .

		If in any respect she is relatively unsne - eessful .

		it is in the delineation of her men .

		A. wickedly disposed critic might describe the hero a '' a ' > blameless prig . ''

		and one could not defend him against the charge with complete success .

		Nor are - the other men who figure in the story as vitally realized as we might wish , for even Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	can not escape the natural limitations of her sex .

		The central situation about which the novel is con - structed has clearly been suggested by the eigh - teenth century model of Mme. Du Deffand and MUe .

		I ` Espinasse .

		It is the direct transfer of his - tory to fiction to represent Lady
Henry	PERSON	, old and blind , as employing Miss Le Breton for a reader and companion , to picture the brilliant salon sustained by the help of the younger woman , to describe the ensuing jealousy and inevitable mptore , and to set forth the residting aligaaMnt of the opposing force * .

		Bat Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	hM
Ampad	ORGANIZATION	the historical sugges - tion to her own modern purpoaes , and we Bhould b '' simply thankful that the actual past has afforded her so happy an inspiration and example . ''

		The Circle , '' by Mrs.
Katherine Cecil Thurston	PERSON	^ is a novel upon the following text : * ' In youth we dream that life is a straight line ; later we know it to be a circle in which the present presses on the future , the future on the past . ''

		The heroine is a girl of grenins , the daughter of a Russian Jew who has found a refuge in
England	LOCATION	and who dreams away his life in a musty cnrio shop in
London	LOCATION	.

		The capabilities of the girl are discovered by a woman of keen perceptions for the unusual in character and intellect , who persuades her to desert her humble home , and fit herself for a brilliant career .

		Several years pass , and when we next meet the heroine , she has become an emotional actress of Euroftean fame .

		In the height of ber success , she meets a man of strong character who wins her love , not knowing her real name or her public position .

		By an accident , he has become acquainted with the history of the actress , including her desertion of her childhood home , and , not dreaming that the woman he loves is the very person in question , tells her the whole story as an illostration of the worthleaaaeaB cl womankind .

		This makes explanation -LRB- JHHwilt , aad she continues to conceal her identity , although she had just been on the point of revealing it .

		It als '' arouses her dormant conscience , and sends her back to the shop to make what atonement she may , and to comfort the last days of her aged father .

		The lover , filled with remorse when he discovers what he has done , seeks her out , and urges his claims with an ardor which eventually wins her for good .

		The leading situations are strained , and the difficulties to be overcome are mostly artificial , but the story is well-planned and straightforward , and makea an impression of originality and force .

		Mrs.
Ella Higginson	PERSON	is favorably known to oar public as the author of some short stories and a volume of rather remarkable verse .

		She represents the far
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	-- the Paget Sound country -- in our imaginative literature , and may almost be said to have annexed this region to the literary map .

		Her 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, new novel , ``
Mariella	LOCATION	; of Out-West , '' is her most ambitious undertaking thus far , and is a strong work of well-sustained interest .

		The heroine is a high-strung passionate girl , with an intense love for nature , whose social environment is of the most un - promising sort .

		We follow her career from child - hood to that fruition of a maiden 's dreams that comes with realized love and the sweeping away of the obstacles in its path .

		For a long time her con - science stands in the way , for she deems herself pledged to the faithful but unlettered rustic whose doglike devotion has been offered her from her early school-days .

		This knot is finally cut by an act of sublime renunciation on his part , when he ` learns that she has given her heart to another , and he persuades her to believe that his own affections have grown cold .

		In the delineation of
Mariella	PERSON	's par - ents and of most of the other characters with whom her sensitive nature is brought into close association , we are provided with the sharpest of contrasts , and ■ no touch of meanness and vulgarity is spared .

		The - only thing that redeems this picture of sordid life is the genuine humor with which it is realized .

		In < this combination of a humorous insight into common life with the intense fundamental seriousness of the work we are irresistibly reminded of the power dis - played in `` The Mill on the Floss . ''

		This sugges - tion may be taken for what it is worth ; it is not meant to imply anything more than that Mrs.
Hig	PERSON	- ginson 's book is distinctly out of the common .

		Another far Western story , the work of Mrs.
■ Fremont Older	PERSON	, is based upon
Kearney	PERSON	's `` sand - ilot '' agitation of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	of the seven - • ties .

		Since that pestiferous demagogue could by no .

		possibility be made the hero of a romantic tale , the author has substituted for him a figure of her own - devising , one
Paul Stryne	PERSON	of mysterious antece - ■ dents , who makes himself , by force of eloquence and sincerity , a leader of the laboring masses in
■ California	LOCATION	, and comes near to effecting a political revolution .

		His relations with a woman , the daugh - ter of a local magnate , prove his downfall when suc - cess is just within his grasp , for they drag him into a duel which has the most disastrous results for his political fortunes .

		This story is called '' The iSocialist and the Prince . ''

		Stryne is the socialist , and the Prince is his rival in the capricious affec - tions of the fair
Theodosia	LOCATION	.

		He seems to be a genuine Italian aristocrat , and yet he says '' buona nuota , '' which is a suspicious circumstance .

		He certainly knows how to make love in truly Southern fashion , although his rival is not to be despised as a practitioner of the same art .

		The story is almost pure melodrama , but has a good deal of spirited action , and is not without historical value in its de - piction of the
California	LOCATION	of the past generation .


Louisiana	LOCATION	is the principal scene of `` Veronica , '' a study of temperament by a new writer .

		Miss
Martha W. Austin	PERSON	.

		It is a love story as far as it is a story at all , but little happens that is worth mentioning .

		Veronica is a young woman who has a great deal - of love to bestow upon somebody .

		At first she gives it to a friend of her youth , who proves utterly unworthy , then she fancies that she has transferred it to a casual acquaintance into whose society she is thrown during a Northern visit , but soon discovers that she has been mistaken .

		Finally , she lavishes it upon a youth whom accident has brought near her
Lousiana	LOCATION	home , but he is a consumptive , and dies just when the affections of the heroine seem to have found a lasting abiding place .

		So the story ends by saying : '' And once more
Veronica	PERSON	began her life . ''

		We hope that she did not make such a mess of the rest of it .

		There is a certain delicacy in style and characterization that saves the book from being as futile as it is inconclusive ; but it is ob - viously the work of an amateur , and would hardly be worth considering did it not hold out some promise of future performance .

		There are some curious slips indicative of ignorance or careless proof-reading , or both .

		There is no '' Siegurd '' in the Wagnerian music-drama , the hero of `` Romola '' is not '' Melemma , '' Goethe never wrote of a '' Land wo die Citronen blumen , '' and a man is certainly not an '' anthropod . ''

		We are very curious to know by what mental process this last word was shaped .

		Why a man should say '' most of us anthropods '' is a dark mystery that we do not pretend to clear up .

		The ambitious purpose of the late
Frank Norris	PERSON	to write '' the epic of the wheat '' in a series of three novels must now remain unfulfilled .

		The plan of this trilogy , it will be remembered , was to embrace the production of the world 's chief food staple , its marketing in the great central city of
America	LOCATION	, and its consumption in some far-off region of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The first of these pictures we had , in '' The Octopus , '' and reviewed at the time of its appearance ; the second we now have , in '' The Pit '' ; the third we shall never have , although we know that it was to be called `` The
Wolf	PERSON	, '' and may well believe that it offered to the novelist a finer opportunity than either of the other two . ''

		The Pit '' is called '' a story of
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' but one must not hastily infer that the suggestion of the title is scriptural , for by it nothing more sinister or infernal is meant than the wheat - market , with its speculative fever and frenzied conflict .

		As far as the story has private interest , both central situation and moral are familar enough .


Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	's novels , and those of many other writers , have preached effectively upon the same text .

		But the author has arrived at something more than private interest , for he has sought to dramatize the clash of commercial arms and the shock of speculative battle , giving to the impersonal forces brought into play the principal share of our at - tention .

		We can not say that the attempt has been altogether successful .

		In this respect '' The Pit '' seems less successful than '' The Octopus '' was , and it was only a very qualified praise that we were able to bestow upon that earlier work .

		Both books are strained , turgid , and unconvincing .

		The posthu - mous book , moreover , shows signs of hurried writ - , ing , and has evidently lacked the revision that the author would have given it had he lived .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJ ^ 243 Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	b another novelist who seeks bis themes in the strenaoos basiness life of today .

		His ''
Roger Drake	PERSON	, Captain of Industry '' is a capital story of its kind ; the material is well ander control , and the plot is skilfully managed .

		It does not attempt to do so big a thing as is attempted in '' The Pit , '' and it seems to as .

		in consequence of this restraint , the better novel of the two .

		But we are deeply suspicious of all these attempts to base works of fiction upon the money-making motive .

		Balzac did it successfully , because he was a genius of the first rank , but our recent American efforts in this direction seem to be little more than a sort of journalism , and none of them possess the elements of permanent interest We have had several good novels of the recon - struction period of late years , among which Mr.
Page	PERSON	's ■ • Red Rock ' '' is probably the best .

		By the side of that masterpeice we must now place '' Ga - briel ToUiver , '' the most extended work of fiction that has been attempted by Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	.

		The strength of this work is in its delin - eation of the types of character , black and white , that were to be found in rural
Alabama	LOCATION	in the sixties .

		Here Mr.
Harris	PERSON	has for his only serious rival the late
Colonel Johnston	PERSON	, and the two men have in `` ommon the same eye for individual idiosyncrasies and the same sense of genial humor .

		The plot of ''
Gabriel Tolliver	PERSON	'' is of the simplest kind .

		There is the love story of Gabriel and
Nan	PERSON	, the arrest of Gabriel on a false charge supported by an unfortu - nate array of circumstantial evidence , his rescue by an ingenious device , and the eventual union with his sweetheart .

		There are numerous minor complica - tions , involving the other personalities concerned , and the total effect of the story is to give as an intimate picture of life in the country town where the action takes place .

		The problem of reconstruction is rep - resented by a carpet-bagger whose death we hardly regret , and the measures taken by the Knights of the
White Camellia	LOCATION	to persuade his deluded negro followers that they had better leave politics alone .

		The charm of this book is very evident , but it is the charm of a series of episodes and character sketches rather than of a narrative of continuous interest . ''

		The Pride of Tellfair , '' by Mr.
Elmore Elliott Peake	PERSON	.

		is a novel which depicts the life of a country town in
Illinois	LOCATION	with sympathy and fidelity .

		It is a story of strictly private interest , with a consider - able variety of characters , the minor types being drawn with almost as much care as those with whom the reader is chiefly concerned .

		So skilful and con - scientious a piece of work is not often met with in the harried production of to-day , and the result is surprisingly interesting , when we consider the un - promising nature of the material offered .

		Were there exhibited a little more of humorous detach - ment , we should be tempted to class the author with Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, or at least to say that he was following close upon the footstepm of the older novelist . '

		• For a
Maiden Brave	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Channcy C. Hotchkiss	PERSON	, is a romance of the American Revolu - tion , the scene being
Long Island	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, the time
1778	DATE	.

		Although the story has this histor - ical background , its interest is essentially private , for it is chiefly concerned with a plot to dispoaaen the hero of an estate willed him by his uncle .

		The life of the hero is sought by the plotters , and , when they fancy they have disposed of him , the uncle be - comes their object of attack .

		It is needless to say that all these villainies are thwarted , and that a surprising series of adventures is contrived for both hero and heroine before they are -RSB- > ermitted to reach a peaceful haven .

		The novel is neither better nor worse than fifty others of similar character that we have read during the past few years .

		In taking up ''
Calvert	PERSON	of Strathore '' we turn from the American to the French Revolution , and the two upheavals are brought into close relation - ship by the American characters who chiefly figure in the story .

		Jefferson and
Morris	PERSON	play important parts , for the scene opens with the
early days of 1789	DATE	, when
Jefferson	PERSON	is still at his poet as Minister of the Confederation , and just before the formal inauguration of the new
United States	LOCATION	government .

		A young friend of the minister , after being gradu - ated from
Princeton	LOCATION	, comes to
Paris	LOCATION	to serve him as a confidential secretary , and the romance is thus supplied with a hero .

		This youth , whose name is the title of the book , has an engaging personality , and falls in love with an aristocratic French maiden who at first rebuffs him , and finally saccumbs .

		The story carries us on through the days of the States General and
Legislative Assembly	ORGANIZATION	down to the death of the Swiss guards , and presents the history of this period in epitome .

		The history is no doubt excel - lent , but there is too much of it , and the private romantic interest for which alone such a story as this exists is fairly swamped .

		We leave the hero and the heroine just as they are starting to make a new home in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The book with which we close the present review is a story of contemporary history , being concerned with oar relations to the
Pacific	LOCATION	islands which the nation claims by the questionable rights of purchase and conquest It is called '' Loyal Traitors , '' and is the work of Mr.
Raymond L. Bridgman	PERSON	.

		It ia an appeal , in the form of fiction , to our national conscience , and is intended to open blind or averted eyes to the hypocritical and otherwise un-American policy which we are now pursuing toward the hap - less inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago .

		Such appeals are mach needed , and will continue to be made by men who are jealous for the fair fame of our coantry , for the question at issue is too moment - ous to be lost sight of , or to lapse into the limbo of indifference .

		Like the question of slavery , which in its fundamental aspects it so much resembles , it will never be settled until it is settled in accordance with the principles upon which our true national great - ness is founded .

		As long as we continue te govern an alien people without their consent , and to with - hold from them the basic guaranties of individual liberty which were won for us by our own ancestors at 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	^ so great a cost , there will be voices raised in protest against so indefensible a course , and against the evil counsellors who have committed us to it for the time being .

		Mr.
Bridgman	PERSON	's voice has the ringing quality that comes from absolute conviction of the justice of his cause , and his work is an effective tract in the propaganda of anti-imperialism .

		Unfortunately , it is not a work of imaginative art , and is conse - quently not of a nature to repeat the moral success of `` Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabip . ''

		Moreover , the author has taken a course calculated to alienate from his cause many wavering sympathies .

		His hero is an American who not only speaks and writes in behalf of the Filipinos , but who actually joins them in arms against his own country .

		This may be severely logical , but it implies a misdirection of zeal .

		He furthermore weakens his case by dragging in the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	, which offers no parallel at all to our war in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		It is quite possible to justify the course of
England	LOCATION	in
Africa	LOCATION	without in any way palliating the conduct of the
United States	LOCATION	government toward the unfortunate people whom we have subjugated .

		Consequently , in spite of our sympathy with Mr.
Bridgman	PERSON	's purpose , and our belief in the justice of the cause for which he pleads , we can not help regarding this book as an ill - considered production , and one that can not alto - gether be counted upon to further the righting of our great national wrong .

		A new phase of the modern exploit - fhTJiid ` w !?!

		^ '' '' '' ^ '' * * ^ ® experiences of the pio - neers upon our western frontier , is presented in `` The Story of the Trapper '' -LRB-
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton -RRB- , by Miss
A. C. Laut	PERSON	.

		This author is already favorably known by her dashing romantic novel , `` The Lords of the North . ''

		In that narrative , the warp of a fictitious plot was skilfully interwoven with the woof of the history of the struggles and the contests , often armed , between rival fur-companies , for supremacy in the fur-bearing regions of western
North America	LOCATION	; and the weaving was so skilful as to embarrass the reader who should endeavor to distinguish fact from fancy .

		For that reason , doubtless , many readers have been unwilling to credit that romance with any basis of historic truth .

		In `` The Story of the Trapper '' many of the start - ling incidents of the novel appear among the cold facts of the fur-hunter 's life .

		We are here furnished a brief sketch of the rival efforts of fur companies to control the rich trade of the far West , and their alternative triumphs and defeats , accompanied by graphic descriptions of the toils , hardships , and suf - ferings of individual trappers and classes or bands of trappers .

		The wildest forms of strenuous life for civilized men , or for men who have once been civilized , are here portrayed .

		The devices adopted , the dangers encountered , the difficulties met and surmounted , the lonely , mystical , and sometimes mysterious life , the rich prizes often secured , and the prices paid therefor in illness , in anguish , and occa - sionally in loss of life itself ; all these which furnish the burden of many a romantic novel , are here coolly set down as the simple facts of daily life , and in number sufficient to furnish the basis for count - less romances .

		Apparently , the author has turned over to the public the abundant riches of a well - filled portfolio of border sketches .

		The white - trapper followed hard upon the footsteps of th & aboriginal Indian , preceding the pioneer explorer often by many years .

		The picture of the trapper 's toils and troubles is therefore a distinctive picture , and one whose outlines , if not preserved now , would soon have been lost forever .

		It seems scarcely credible that a woman should be able to fill in such a picture from her own personal sketches ; yet Miss Laut claims to have been so far a part of the wild existence she portrays , as to be able to speak of her own knowledge as to much that she narrates , and to have had the opportunity on the very ground to dis - cover the truth as to much which she learned from tradition .

		Whosoever would know of the acute - perils of the bear hunt and of encounter with a pack of hungry wolves , of the mode of life of the beaver , the musk-rat , and other aquatic animals , , of the thieving propensities of wolverine , coyote , and wild-cat , and of all the minutiae which go to fill up the daily round of the frontier trapper and help him swell the proceeds of his athletic and engrossing vocation , will find the account here given , , though often disconnected , always deeply inter - esting .

		The Reaction in

France	LOCATION	after lished in

		jj ^ ; ^ Currents in Nineteenth Cen - tury Literature , '' by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		It now appears as a volume of the English translation of thi '' great work -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The reaction concerned is , of course , from the radicalism and subversive temper of the Revolution , and is typified by such men as Chateaubriand and
Joseph de Maistre	ORGANIZATION	.

		After the introductory historical chapters on the Revolution , the Concordat , and the principle of authority , the author states his main thesis in these terms : '' By sounding here and sounding ; there , and every-vrheTO coming upon the same fundamental thought , we have dis - covered what was the ruling idea of the new period .

		It may be called by many names .

		It is the great principle of ex - ternality , as opposed to that of inward , personal feeling and private investigation ; it is the great principle of theocracy , of the sovereignty of Qod , as opposed to the sovereignty of the people ; it is the principle of authority and power , as opposed to the principle of liberty , of human rights , and of human in - terdependence .

		And when we examine the life of the day in all its various developments , we everywhere find the same watchword and the same white flag .

		The fundamental idea sets its mark upon everything . ''

		This volume , then , is a study of the rise of the prin - ciple of authority from the ruins of the Revolution ,
1903	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 245 of its growing ascendency and temporary suprenn - acy , of its disintegration and final downfall .

		This is clearly one of the most distinctly defined acts in the drama of modern intellectaal development .

		Hav - ing cleared his ground by a historical survey , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	devotes the central section of his book to special studies of
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	,
de Maistre	ORGANIZATION	,
Bonald	LOCATION	,
Madame de Kriidener	ORGANIZATION	, and the earlier phases of Lamartine and Hugo .

		Then follows a chapter on '' Love in the Literature of the Period , '' with illus - trations from
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	,
Madame de KiUdener	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lamartine	PERSON	, and the work closes with three chapters on the dissolution of the principle of au - thority in both the theoretical and the practical spheres , and the collapse of the reaction under the influence of such men as
Lamennais	LOCATION	,
Courier	PERSON	, B ^ ranger , and the later Hugo .

		The spirit of ro - manticism was stirring in the French intellect , and the principle that had held sway for a generation had lost its power to repress the natural reason and imagination .

		This volume is one of the most deeply interesting of the entire series to which it belongs , and displays to the best advantage that large out - look upon life and thought which is characteristic of the author , and which has earned for him his distinguished place among European critics .

		Quincy , Ma4 , .

		, ^ free-handed and gossippy recital of andUt/amotu the local history , family traditions , group o/patrioit .

		anecdotes , and memorabilia of a well - known
Massachusetts	LOCATION	town -LRB- Quincy -RRB- makes up the content of a creditable volume at the hands of Mr.
Daniel Munro Wilson	PERSON	, entitled '' Where American Independence Began '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This title is ill-advised and misleading ; its place would have been better filled by the sub-title , '' Quincy : Its
Famous Group of Patriots	ORGANIZATION	, their Deeds , Homes , and Descendants . ''

		The author suggests , and appears to insist , that American independence was born in
Braintree	LOCATION	-LRB- from which town Quincy was afterward set off -RRB- , with the birth of
John Adams	PERSON	, in
1737	DATE	.

		But this boast does not come with the authority of
John Adams	PERSON	himself , and probably never would have had his countenance ; for he himself declared , as Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	does not omit to recite , that '' the child Independence was born '' in
1761	DATE	, with the argument of
James Otis	PERSON	in opposition to the
Writs of Assistance	ORGANIZATION	.

		But in spite of this extravagant claim , the book is , happily , most readable and enter - taining .

		The genealogies of the great families which have been reared and have flourished in this favored town receive extended and deserved attention .

		The lives and careers of the Adamses and Quincys and
Hancocks	PERSON	are traced for generations , and the por - traits of successive members of these remarkable families adorn the pages of the narrative , inter - spersed with views of buildings , monuments , and ecenery .

		Biographical sketches of the three great diplomats of as many generations of one family --
John	PERSON	,
John Quincy	PERSON	, and
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	-- add substantial value to the story ; and there is a Quincy genealogy , exhibiting the six successive
Josiah Quincys	PERSON	, and embellished with the portraits of demure damsels in several generations , each named ''
Dorothy	PERSON	Q. '' The singular fact is noted in these pages , that while in most great families the descent is from sire to son , in this exceptional family the descent has been from ` Siah to ` Slab .

		Time has not operated to excuse the sons of this
Massachu	PERSON	- setts town from public service , and tha narrative illustrates the prominence and the conspicuous work of the Adamses and
Hoars	ORGANIZATION	and Quincys who are our contemporaries .

		The friendly and sympathetic spirit which brightens every page shows that the preservation and publication of these Ana has been a labor of love with the author .

		Mont Peiie and Although several books on the same the tragedy of absorbing topic have preceded Pro- Martiniqve .

		fessor
Angelo Heilprin	PERSON	's `` Mont Pel ^ e and the Tragedy of Mariinque '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , none of them has had the benefit of the same study and preparation that have gone to the mak - ing of this large and handsome work .

		The author reached the unhappy island on the 25th of
May last	DATE	, -- two weeks and a half after the catastrophe , -- and found , instead of the beautiful tropical island of the books , '' a withered piece of the earth that seemed to be just emerging from chaos . ''

		He remained , with a brief intermission , until Septem - ber was well begun , engaged in investigation and exploration , the numerous photographs he took forming the illustrations for the present volume .

		The mystery of this dire tragedy lies largely in the wave of destruction that swept down from the vol - cano upon the people of
St. Pierre	LOCATION	on the
8th of May	DATE	, leaving but two survivors out of the thou - sands who were in its course .

		In this wave , which was seen from points of vantage and scientific ob - servatories as '' a great black cloud '' issuing from the mountain and rolling down its slopes into the sea , there were '' light detonations '' observed , bat no flame until its passage over the city had set the buildings afire .

		It was of force sufficient to wrest the strongest edifices of
St. Pierre	ORGANIZATION	from their foundations , and leave them , iron - work and all , mere crumbled ruins ; yet long clay pipes were found hanging where they had been exposed for sale without damage .

		It burned the bodies of some of those it overwhelmed , stripped others of their clothing , and still left a bird 's plumage intact and paper packages of food uncharred .

		One of the survivors was
Augnste Ciparis	PERSON	, who was at the time in the city jail . ''

		He was waiting for the usual breakfast on the 8th , '' Professor
Heilprin	PERSON	records , '' when it suddenly grew dark , and immediately afterwards hot air , laden with ash , entered his room through the door-grating .

		It came gently but fiercely .

		His flesh was instantly burned , and he jumped about in agony , vainly calling for help .

		The heat that scorched him was intense , but lasted for an instant only , and during that time be almost ceased to breathe .

		There was no accompanying smoke , no noise of any kind , and no odor to sug - 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, gest a burning gas .

		The hot air and ash were the working demons that tore his flesh .

		Ciparis was clad at that time in hat , shirt , and trousers , but his clothing did not take fire ; yet beneath his shirt his back was terribly burned . ''

		The book is interesting throughout , and written in a vivid and picturesque style that retains a not unpleasant exotic flavor through the occasional use of foreign idiom .

Scotland	LOCATION	, gives us , in '' The Great Marquess '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , a full and painstaking account of the life and times , not of
Montrose	LOCATION	, as one might expect from the main title , but of his contemporary and rival ,
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	, whom the author ably champions as having superior claims to this designation .

		With Scott 's '' Legend of
Montrose	LOCATION	'' in the other scale-pan , this learned but not equally fascinating work will hardly tip the balance in favor of
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	as a popular hero , though the book is one that was well worth writing , no life of the man , outside of histories and bio - graphical dictionaries , having before appeared .

		No attempt is made to settle the disputed derivation of the clan name ,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	; but the commonly re - ceived date of
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	's birth ,
1598	DATE	, is by fairly con - clusive evidence shown to be wrong , and that event placed nine years later .

		If it be true , however , that the boy accompanied his father in
1615	DATE	, when the last desperate uprising of the Clandonalds was put down , the earlier date would seem more prob - able .

		But this matter is not mentioned .

		The really Socratic calm and cheerfulness with which
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	faced his execution at the end , makes the reader very willing to style him a great , if not the Great , Marquess .

		The book has seven portraits , abundant footnotes , an appendix , and an eight-page index .

		The romance ^ ^ ^ Southeastern province of
France	LOCATION	and beauty is full of the romance of the Middle of
Provence	LOCATION	.

		^ g ^ g Frowning old castles and rugged rocky hillsides tell tales of surpassing in - terest to the historian .

		Mr.
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	has familiarized himself with many of the thrilling events of the past and with the quaint and homely customs of to-day in this province of sunshine , and has put them in an attractive form under the title `` Christmas Kalends of
Provence	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , though this title covers but one of the three parts of the book .

		The cutting of the yule-log and its conveyance to the home , the long festive days and evenings of Christmas week , and the simplicity of the stories told on these occasions , give us a peep into the beautiful neighborhood and home-life of those simple folk .

		`` A Feast-Day on the Rhone '' and '' The Com ^ die Fran ^ aise at Orange '' are the other two parts of the work .

		The first gives us a glimpse of a biennial pilgrimage to the F ^ librige and the Cigaliers , and the queer experiences which charmed the pilgrims at every turn on the way ; and in the second part we catch a view of the Roman theatre of fifteen centuries ago at Orange , Tht title of '' The Lark once more .

		and follow at a distance its checkered and trag - ical career .

		As it is to-day , it is the most perfect Roman theatre in existence , outranking the much better known edifice at
Pompeii	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	puts color into his pictures , and fixes on our minds scenes of rare beauty and romance .

		Few periodicals as short-lived as '' The Lark '' will be remembered BO long and so pleasantly . ''

		The Lark '' was issued for the fun of it ; it typified the play-principles in literature .

		And because it represented the over-flowing exuberance of youth '' talking right on , '' we listened , caught by a new note , familiar enough in theory but too little practiced among us staid Anglo-Saxons , who culti - vate no art but literature and take that very ser - iously indeed .

		This note of `` The Lark '' dominates Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	's recently published volume of essays , '' The Romance of the Commonplace '' -LRB-
Elder & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Some of the essays , indeed , were first published in that periodical ; others were written for '' The Queen , '' a
London	LOCATION	magazine ; but all are alike in their convincingly optimistic attitude to - ward every-day life , and all are interesting be - cause that attitude seems so genuine .

		Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	evidently understands '' The Use of Fools , '' and knows by experience the joy of '' The Deserted Island , '' which is a new sort of Spanish castle .

		For him , correspondence is a delightful game , and '' Dining Out '' a real diversion .

		He does not wish to trifle with life , but he sees no harm in en - joying it , sportsmanlike , as he goes along .

		Only , one must take an active part in the game , not be a mere spectator . ''

		We are here not be entertained , but to entertain ourselves , '' Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	tells us .

		His enthusiasm is contagious , and his suggestions about glorifying the commonplace are very refresh - ing , if scarcely vital enough to be inspiring .

		`` Telepathic '' or `` Can Telepathy Explain ? ''

		is the `` epiruttaiistio '' query raised by Mr.
Minot J. Savage	PERSON	occult theories .

		j ^ ^ gmall volume recently issued by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The problem dis - cussed is whether the alleged facts of the occult type are better explained by the '' telepathic '' or by the '' spiritualistic '' theory .

		Mr.
Savage	PERSON	de - cides in favor of the latter .

		The volume , brief as it is , is a sad piece of reading .

		It furnishes need - lessly plain evidence that the temperament and training of the author , and his appreciation of the evidential value of fact , are all so inadequate and distorted as to result in a presentation that would be ridiculous were it not deplorable .

		Such writings do no end of harm , because they get referred to and respected by persons who are looking about for well - known names to bolster personal prejudices .

		They do no good ; for they merely confuse the questions they are intended to illuminate .

		As soon as the requirements that are necessary for one to record a valuable opinion upon such subjects are more gen - erally understood , the appearance of such books as this will become happily rare .

		1903 -RSB- THE DIAJ ^ 247 Notes , A new novel br Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	, en - titled '' For the Sake of his Company : A Tale of the Misty Citv , '' will be published at once by Mr.
A. M. Robertson	PERSON	of

		The passing out of copyright of ''
Elsie Venner	PERSON	'' is signalized by the appearance of a new and cheaper edition of that famous noveL In its present form it is one of the ''

		HThe recent death of
Gaston Pans	ORGANIZATION	lends a melan - choly interest to the little volume on '' Medivsval French Literature , '' just published as a '' Temple Primer '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Considering its source , we need hardly emphasize the fact that this brief treatment of a great subject is absolutely masterly from the point of view of the scholar , and itself the best of good litera - ture from the point of view of those who are concerned with such matters as style and manner of presentation .

		BRIEFER MENTION 278 NOTES 279 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 279 TffE TWO LOST YEARS .

		There has been mach confusion of aim and playing at cross-purposes in the educational discussions of recent years , yet a few fairly definite principles may be found to emerge from all this expression of varied and fre - quently ill-considered opinion .

		Upon no other point , perhaps , has there been such general agreement as upon the assertion that in our American scheme of public education there is a sum of wasted or misdirected energy which amounts to the work of about two years .

		In other words , the time which we take in trans - forming the raw material of childhood into the finished product , if it may be so styled , which is turned out from the colleges and the pro- fessional schools is about two years longer than it ou '' ht to be under conditions of economical management .

		In most of the European sys - tems , results substantially equivalent to our own are produced in much less time , and the grad - uate is ready to enter upon the work of his life at an appreciably earlier age .

		Now two years of waste in educational work is a serious mat - ter , and the question of avoiding so great a loss is one of the most important that confronts our educational workers .

		We may well defer the settlement of minor problems until we have united upon some method of attacking this major problem of the two lost years .

		tVe have no doubt whatever that the greater part of this loss falls within the period of ele - mentary education .

		That period ends with us at the average age of fourteen or fifteen , and it should end
two years earlier	DATE	.

		Most of our systems allow eight years for this preliminary school work -LRB- not including the kindergarten in the reckoning -RRB- , when seven years would be ample , and six within the bounds of possibility under conditions of intelligent instruction and favoring home influences .

		That neither of these conditions exists to any general extent is a fact widely acknowledged and deplored .

		The quality of our elementary teaching leaves much to be desired , and is fairly put to shame when compared with the similar grade of teaching in
France	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	.

		An additional element of waste is found in the unscientific programmes of our elementary schools , with their frequent 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, experimental intrusion of doubtful matter , and their lack of suitable coordination .

		That the home does not work in sympathy with the school is also a fact too evident to require proof .

		The average parent of the public school child `` faows a shocking lack of responsibility in this ` matter .

		The whole burden is left for the : school to bear , when it ought to be largely shared by the home .

		The influence of the parent is often directly antagonistic to educa - tional advancement , for it makes a vice of in - dulgence , and encourages the child in all sorts of outside interests at the direct expense of his educational weal .

		These facts are so generally admitted by ed - ucators that it would be unnecessary to bring them forward for restatement were it not for a surprising recent development in educational opinion .

		Until very recently , it has been taken for granted that the remedy for all this waste was to be found in strengthening the work of the early years , in organizing instruction upon a more scientific basis , and in developing the sense of responsibility in the parent .

		The waste and the remedy have been equally evident , and it has seemed that the only thing to do was to do away with the one by applying the other .

		But , whether impatient of a reform that must inevitably require many years for its accom - plishment , or actuated by a desire to win the unthinking applause of the multitude , certain persons high in authority have of late been seeking to persuade us that we had better save the lost years at the upper end of the educa - tional scale , and give up the hope of a really pedagogical treatment of the difficulty .

		A col - lege course of two years , leading to the custom - ary bachelor 's degree , is what has been actually recommended for our consideration by the presi - dent of one of our great universities .

		By this surgical short cut we are to deal with a disease which calls for patient scientific treatment , while we are leaving the old malignant forces fitill at work in the organism .

		We are certainly not opposed to measures of rational economy undertaken with respect to any part of the scholastic programme .

		The up - per reaches of the educational scheme may have their defects as well as the lower ones .

		As far as this is found to be true , suitable remedies should be sought and applied .

		We are in sym - pathy with those higher institutions that en - courage the exceptional student to perform in three years the work that busies the average student for four .

		We are even in sympathy with the present marked tendency to permit the last year of collegiate work to stand also for the first year of professional training .

		But we are distinctly opposed to any plan for making the college degree less difficult of attainment than it now is , or for shortening the traditional period of the American college course .

		The bachelor 's degree means little enough under ex - isting conditions , except for the few determined students who by their own zeal for learning make it mean what it should , and even were there no way of saving time and energy before the college is reached , it would still be an un - worthy concession to the spirit of commercial - ism to award that degree any more readily than it is now awarded .

		It is not so serious a matter as all that to give our young men what is curi - ously called their `` start in life '' a year or two earlier than it is given them under existing con - ditions .

		Aside from this wholly inadequate reason for cheapening our higher education , the advocates of a college course of three or two years seem to find their main reliance in the argument that college entrance requirements are now more dif - ficult than they were a generation ago , and that consequently the sophomore of to-day is as much of a scholar as his father was when a senior ; that the end of two years of college life now marks about the same average of attainment as was then marked by the ceremony of gradua - tion .

		We are not altogether sure of this , but admitting it for the moment , we would remark parenthetically that by going back half a dozen generations we may discover a strenuous condition of college scholarship that puts our best present achievements to shame .

		Cotton Mather , graduated from
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	at fifteen , offers an example of what education could then accomplish ; we can not match that record in our own times , not even by the college career of
John Fiske	PERSON	.

		We may not care for the type of learning which those old Puritan students achieved , but we can not deny the solidity of their parts .

		If it be indeed true that the graduate of the last generation was no better educated than is the sophomore of to-day , it means nothing more than that we have recovered , by a pain - ful process of gradual advancement , some - thing of the educational seriousness of an age long past .

		And now that we have in a cer - tain measure overcome the laxity which reigned in the methods and the demands of our fathers , are we suddenly to give up all that has been
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		263 thus won for the sake of lengthening by a year or two the gainful period of life ?

		Is the active life , under the conditions of this fever - ish modern world , so much more important than the contemplative life that we should make such a sacrifice ?

		It seems to us that to state these questions squarely is to answer them in the negative , and that it should rather be our watchword to strengthen and enrich as fully as we may the years which are al - ready consecrated to education , but not to abate by a single jot the demands which we are now enabled to make of the college grad - uate .

		We are glad to note that the sugges - tions recently made with a view to curtailment -LRB- or rather decapitation -RRB- of the college course have met with a general chorus of disapproval and that the wisely conservative opinion seems still to prevail among our most influential edu - cators .

		There is one rather marked recent tendency in the treatment of collegiate education which we believe to be praiseworthy .

		The ten - dency to connect more closely the work of the colleges with that of the secondary schools ; even transferring to the latter the first year or two of the training hitherto reserved for the former , is a movement which is commended by important practical considerations , and which does not impair the present achieved ideal of scholarship .

		We are glad to note the increasing development of academic insti - tutions which cover the first two years of col - lege , and the extension in the same direction of the work of our larger high-schools .

		The essential thing about college work is its char - acter and spirit ; the place where it is done is of minor importance .

		There is no doubt a certain sentimental value in the traditional plan of a continuous four years ' course in the same college ; the resulting ties and associations are not to be despised .

		But the plan which makes it possible for students to get half way through college without leaving home means the possibility of the higher education for thousands who other - wise would not get it at all , and this is a con - sideration which must be held to outweigh the other .

		In the homely phrase , half a loaf is better than no bread , and many of those who by such means get the first half will contrive to get the other half as well .

		The institution , whether public or private , which is engaged in performing this service deserves the most cor - dial encouragement , and we look forward to the time when every large city in the
United States	LOCATION	will accept among its recognized duties that of providing at public cost an education roughly equivalent to that of the German Gymnasiun ^ With such an enlargement of the functions of our public secondary schools , and with the establishment where most needed of private foundations , similar in scope , our colleges will everywhere be given a new im - pulse , and their membership will be recruited in ever increasing numbers .

		They will by no means abandon their own provisions for the first years of college work , but the present disparity in the numbers of their lower and upper classes will disappear , and possibly be - come reversed in the favor of the latter .

		We believe that this will be the next great step taken in the development of the work of higher education in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		THE ORIGIN OF `` BLIZZARD . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In the ''
Virginia	LOCATION	Literary Museum '' for
1829	DATE	, will be found the following : '' Blizzard . '

		A violent blow -- ' perhaps from
Blilz	LOCATION	, -LSB- Germl lightning .

		Kentucky '' -LRB- i. 418 -RRB- .

		In 1834
Davy Crockett	PERSON	wrote : `` I started down the edge of the river low grounds , giving out the pursuit of my elks , and had n't g ^ ne hardly any distance at all , before I saw two more bucks , very large fellows too .

		I took a blizzard at one of them , and up he tumbled .

		The other ran off a few jumps and stop 'd ; and stood there till I loaded again , and fired at him '' -LRB- `` Narrative , '' p. 152 -RRB- .

		In
1835	DATE	Crockett again used the word -LRB- in his '' Tour , '' p. 16 -RRB- , but in a sense which was misunder - stood by
Bartlet	PERSON	and which has proved a puzzle to lex - icographers .

		An examination of the entire passage -LRB- too long to give here -RRB- and a comparison with the ex - tract just quoted , show that in
1835	DATE	the word was em - ployed figuratively as meaning a sort of extinguisher , a '' squelcher . ''

		No instance of blizzard has been re - corded between
1835	DATE	and
1880	DATE	, but the word is said to have appeared in its now familiar sense in a
Dakota	LOCATION	newspaper in
1867	DATE	.

		Professor Cleveland Abbe calls my attention to the first use of the word in the `` Monthly Weather Review '' for
December , 1876	DATE	, as follows : `` The very severe storms known in local parlance as ' blizzards ' were reported on the 8th as prevailing in
Iowa	LOCATION	and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, where temperatures of -15 ° and -20 ° prevailed , with violent northwest winds and much drifting snow '' -LRB- p. 424 -RRB- .

		It may be added that in the sixties and seventies of the
last century	DATE	what we now call blizzards were on the plains termed northers -- a word which apparently originated in
Texas	LOCATION	, where , -LRB- as applied to a north wind -RRB- it is found as early as
1838	DATE	.

		Can any of your readers furnish me with examples of blizzard , in any sense , previous to 1880 ?

		A QUEKN OF Letter-Writers .

		* Mrs.
Basil Montagu	PERSON	once Ikid to Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	, ``
Jane	PERSON	, everybody is born with a vo - cation , and yours is to write little notes . ''

		A fresh instalment of these piquant little letters -- hardly inferior in general interest , and not at all inferior in style , to those already selected and published as the cream of her correspond - ence , -- will be warmly welcomed by all Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's admirers .

		No one can read these volumes without being tempted to paraphrase a late eminent states - man and declare that
Froude	PERSON	never put pen to paper without subtracting from the sum of human knowledge .

		A long and illuminating introduction by Sir
James Crichton-Browne	PERSON	gives a psychological analysis of that extraor - dinary editor 's method of unerring inaccuracy in treating the
Carlyles	ORGANIZATION	' domestic relations .

		Froude is shown to have been the victim of pre - conceived ideas .

		Having made one false as - sertion , he felt himself bound to support it by another equally false , and so on to greater and greater perversions of the truth .

		Carlyle had used the word remorse in speaking of his feel - ing for his deceased wife .

		Mordant sorrow -- and , by the way , both
Chapman	PERSON	and
Dryden	PERSON	use the term in this sense -- was what the bereaved husband meant ; but
Froude	PERSON	chose to interpret the word as bitter self-reproach .

		Jlinc illcB lacrimm .

		The Carlyles ' early life at Craigenputtock has been depicted by
Froude	PERSON	as one of the lone - liest and dreariest imaginable ; but the young wife 's letters written then and there falsify this view almost as effectively as if penned for the purpose .

		By
Froude	PERSON	's own confession , he knew practically nothing of her life there .

		He says , mistakenly , that few of her letters of the period were preserved , and that consequently '' we are left pretty much to guess her condition ; and of guesses , the fewer that are ventured the better . ''

		Yet he has hazarded a good many guesses , and how bad they were was shown by the publi - cation of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's '' Early Letters '' in
1889	DATE	.

		The editor of this third collection of her letters points out these and many other instances of '' Froudacity , '' some of them so • New Lktters and Memorials of
Jane Welsh Cakltlb	PERSON	.

		Annotated by
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	, and edited by
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	, with an introduction by Sir
James Crichton-Browne	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , F.R.S. .

		In two volumes .

		Illnstrated .

		New York :
John Lane	PERSON	.

		wantonly mischievous , if not malicious , as to stagger belief .

		For instance , introducing the letters of
July , 1843	DATE	,
Froude	PERSON	published the following to support his charge of selfishness against Carlyle : '' The house in Cheyne Row requiring paint and other readjustments ,
Carlyle	PERSON	had gone on a visit to
Wales	LOCATION	, leaving his Wife to endure the confusion and super - intend the workmen , alone with her maid . ''

		And all the time he had in his keeping letters proving the falsity of such assertions .

		Both Mr. and Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	had been invited to visit the Redwoods , in
Wales	LOCATION	, but for reasons of her own Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	declined .

		Carlyle urged her to accompany him on this
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	tour .

		Failing in this , he next proposed to take a furnished cottage near
Nottingham	LOCATION	, in which they should spend the month of
August	DATE	together .

		To the letter proposing this Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	replies : '' Never mind me .

		Dearest ; try to get the most good of the Country that can be got for your - self ; I do not care a farthing for Country air ; and am busier here than I could be anywhere else .

		Besides I should like to go to
Liverpool	LOCATION	when my Uncle returns home . ''

		These words were suppressed by
Froude	PERSON	in publishing the letter of which they form a part .

		The truth of the matter is , Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	had set her heart on decorating her house a little that
summer	DATE	, and therefore managed to get her husband out of the way for this very purpose .

		So one might go on citing instances of both the suppressio veri and the suggestio falsi ; omission , mis - quoting , and wrong dating being the expedients commonly adopted .

		But let us turn to something pleasanter and more profitable .

		Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's vein is already familiar to the reading public , and she is as bright and entertaining here as in the earlier - published correspondence .

		The first of the letters now offered is dated nine years earlier than the first letter of '' Letters and Memo - rials , '' the last only a few months before the writer 's death , and all , with some half-dozen exceptions , now see the light for the first time .

		The greater number are to her husband .

		Kins - folk and a few intimate friends claim the rest .

		One letter of the Craigenputtock period is es - pecially significant in view of
Froude	PERSON	's picture of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's dreary existence at that time .

		Visiting her mother at
Templand	ORGANIZATION	in
1828	DATE	, the young wife writes back : ''
Kindest	PERSON	and dearest of Husbands -- Are you think - ing you are never to see my sweet face any more ?

		... What progress you will have been making with
Burns	PERSON	in my absence !

		I wish I were back to see it ; and to

		THE DIAL 265 give TOO a kiss for everj minute I have been absent .

		Bat Tou will not miss me so terriblj as I did too .

		Dearest , I do lore voa !

		Is it not a proof of this that I am wearjing to be back to Craigenputtoek even as U tlandt , and while ererrone here is trring to make mj stay agreeable to me !

		... God bless jou , darling .

		You will send the horses for me on
Sunday	DATE	, und nidiU widtr dawm !

		Ever , ever your true wife . ''

		In the sammer of
1837	DATE	she went on a tour of pleasure with Mr. and Mrs.
Sterling	PERSON	.

		This is what she writes to her husband about nature : '' Every day I felt more emphatically that Xature was an intolerable bore .

		Do not misconstrue me , -- genuioe , unsophisticated Xatnre , I grant you , is all very amiable and hannleas ; but beautiful
Xatore	LOCATION	, which man has exploited , as a Reviewer does a work of ge - nius , making it a peg to bang his own conceits upon , to enact his Triumpk der Ewqtjmdaamkxii in , -- beanttfnl Nature , which yon Xock .

		oak npon from pea-gieen arbonre , which you dawdle about in on the backs of donkeys , and where you are haunted with an everlast - ing smell of roast meat -- all that I do declare to be the greatest of bores , and I would rather spend my days amidst acknowledged brick houses and pared streets , than in such a fools ' paradise . ''

		Two pen portraits , or rather caricatures , of
James Martineau	PERSON	are amusing .

		In the second the editor allows only the initials to appear , but the place and date -LRB-
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	, 1846 -RRB- help to make the reference unmistakable .

		** He is anything but happy , I am sure : a more eonoentrated expression of melancholy I never saw in a hnman face .

		I fancy him to be the victim of consci - eoee , which is the next thing to being the victim of green tea !

		His heart and intellect both protest against this bondage ; and so he is a man divided against him - self .

		I should like to convert him -- mot . '

		If he could be reduced into a wholesome state of spontaneous black - guardism for six months , be would ■ come out very strong . '

		But he feels that there is no credit in being -LRB- spiritually -RRB- joUy in his present immaculate condition , and so he is as sad as any sinner of us all . '' ''

		I went to hear J -- M -- yesterday morning , as a compromise betwixt going to the Family Cbarch and cansiBg a Family disturbance by staying at home .

		The sennon was ' no go . '

		The poor man had got something to say which be did not believe , and could not conceal the difficulty he found io eonformmg .

		Flo irets of rhetoric world without end , to cover over the barrenness of the soil !

		I felt quite mae tor him ; he looked such a pictnre of conscientioaa aapuah while be was overlaying his Christ with similes and metaphors , that people might not see what a wooden puppet he had made of him to himself , -- in great need of getting flung overboard after the
Virgin Mary	PERSON	, ' Madame sa Mfere . ' ''

		Even daring the melancholy and tryins period of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's morbid despondency -LRB-
1846	DATE	-- 57 -RRB- her letters maintain their wonted sprightly flow of amusing chit-chat .

		Once and again , perhaps , we catch a glimpse of the dark undercurrent , as when she says in a letter to her brother-in-law , Dr.
John Carlyle	PERSON	: '' My cold is away again ; but , oh , dear !

		my ' interior ' is always very miserable ; and nothing that I do or for - bear seems to make the least difference .

		The worst is the dreadfol pressure on my faculties .

		There are kinds of illneases that one can work under , but this sort of thing that I go on with makes everything next to im - possible for me . ''

		In a few days , however , her pen is running on again as usual , with an amusing reference to a letter addressed to '' Mrs.
T. Carlyle	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	'' Her little phrases of endearment to her husband are always beautiful and touching .

		Such a pair of married lovers , thinks the reader , one knows not the like of ; and the little harshnesses of daily intercourse fall back into their true in - significance in the light of these letters .

		Be - fore company , and even in private , the dour Scotch nature is confessedly given to express - ing its conjugal affection in negatives .

		What but love and sjrmpathy could have dictated such a passage as the following , which opens a letter written by the wife to her husband after thirty - four years of married life ? ''

		I do hate .

		Dear , to tell all about myself every Day !

		as if I were ' the crops , ' or something of that sort .

		When ■ I ` se no better , I ` se ashamed to say it ' ; and when I am better I ` se equally ashamed to be cackling aboat my welloeaMs ; and so I shall be glad when yon can see with yoor own eyes how I am instead of my telling yoa in words . ''

		The letter closes with a '' God be with you !

		Ever yours . ''

		Finally , in a letter written only a year before her death , excusing herself for letting a day pass without sending the usual token of affection to her absent husband , she says : '' Again yon have had no Letter , Dear !

		But , in compensation , all the ink-spots are out of yonr writing - table !

		Had it been going strai ^ t to any Literary Museum , I should n't have meddled with the mi , which Hero-worshippers might have regarded with a certain adoration ; but for your oicn use I thought yoo would like it better clean !

		It has never been cleaned , that poor table , sbwe I aaed to do all the Housework myself !

		And it is a wonder of heaven that I should be up to such work again , after all ; and I can not better express my thankfulness than in working while I may !

		So I fastened on the table after breakfast this morn - ing , and rubbed at it the wk < ^ time till the eaniage came at two !

		Of course Jegaie eonld haTe waxed aad torpentined the table better than I ; but no one but me , I flatter myself , could have shown the patience and in - genuity neeeasary for extracting all that ink ! ''

		A tboasand pities it is that Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's entire correspondence -- forming , as annotated by a husband 's loving hand , a most charming and impressive work of literature -- could not have been entrusted at the outset to the sym - pathy and discretion of the present editor , who has done his work so wisely and so well .

		We should then have been spared all those incred - ible twistings of the truth that make one gasp 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, with astonishment as they are revealed in read - ing the present collection .

		Even in the mat - ter of verbal inaccuracies the chosen literary executor achieved the unbelievable .

		Professor
Norton	PERSON	found one hundred and thirty-six cor - rections necessary in the first five pages of the '' Reminiscences . ''

		Surely such a positive ge - nius for wanton error the literary world has never seen , before or since .

		A service has been rendered to the cause of truth and a pious trib - ute paid to the memory of two suffering souls by the publication of these letters , unsubjected to the racking , amputating , disembowelling process adopted in the '' Letters and Memo - rials . ''

		The two volumes are of excellent work - manship , the clear type and finely-executed portraits being a delight to the eye .

		Percy Favor
Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Italian Renaissance in
England	LOCATION	.

		* There are two ways of dealing with a large subject , the method of scholarship and the method of literature .

		Of the first , an excel - lent example is
Warton	PERSON	's '' History of English Poetry , '' a book which was so well made more than a hundred years ago that it still holds its own , in spite of the great advances in English scholarship and criticism since Thomas War - ton 's time .

		Of the large subject treated with learning , with judgment , and with style , no book in English surpasses
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History of the English People . ''

		The first impression that is left on reading Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's account of '' The Italian Ren - aissance in
England	LOCATION	, '' -- an impression that is but deepened by a more careful examination of the book , -- is , that the subject is entirely too large for a thesis .

		Any graduate student is bound to come to grief with a subject that comprehends two centuries of time and two great literatures .

		To cope with so vast a theme there is required , first of all , a full man , one who has read widely at first hand .

		And then to sufficiency of equipment there should be added critical acumen and a sense of the relative value of things .

		It is the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out , to discuss the Italian Renaissance in
England	LOCATION	, crowding the whole of the great drama within the space of three pages .

		So the Italianization of Shakes - peare gets here but three pages more .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition to immaturity , Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	labors under the further disadvantage of not being to the manner born in either of the lit - eratures he is writing about .

		The external point of view is curiously marked .

		The discussion of English poetry is timid , dry , and wholly inadequate ; while there is absolutely nothing in the treatment of English politics which would suggest that the Tudors had some - thing to do with the development of the mod - ern state .

		Machiavelli and
Elizabeth	PERSON	to the contrary , the English Constitution is as con - spicuously absent from Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's book as the Elizabethan drama .

		On the other hand , the chapter on the Italian merchant in
England	LOCATION	is written con amore .

		The plentiful dearth of humor in these pages , if it is not foreign , suggests at least the
Baker	PERSON	's perplexity : '' I said it in
Hebrew	LOCATION	, -- I said it in Dutch , -- I said it in Qerman and Qreek ; But I wholly forgot -LRB- and it vexes me much -RRB- That English is what you speak t '' No man of English strain , and no Italian , could possibly have walked through these two cen - turies of grandly humorous literature without even once cracking a smile .

		There is one bit of unconscious humor , where the fear of bri - gands and the inconveniences of travel are na - ively urged to explain the fact that the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan travellers in
Italy	LOCATION	made no account of the landscape .

		The English traveller affords a good illustration of the author 's heavy manner of treating an attractive theme .

		Almost every Englishman of note during the reigns of
Eliza	PERSON	- beth and
James	PERSON	made the tour to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		They were statesmen , diplomatists , poets , artists , scholars , men of fashion and of leisure .

		The literature of the time is full of their experiences and of the ideas they brought home on all sorts of subjects .

		But the great body of this literature -LRB- which often bubbles over with fun -RRB- is a closed book to Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	, who confines his attention to two or three early guide books .

		He quotes Dallington 's '' Method for Travel , '' but does not mention
Fynes Moryson	PERSON	, nor
Lithgow	PERSON	, nor
Coryate	ORGANIZATION	.

		He knows
Sidney	PERSON	as a traveller , but not Crashaw ,

Henry Wotton	PERSON	, and literally scores of fa - mous Elizabethans .

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	has fallen into a good many errors of fact and of opinion .

		Names of per - sons are frequently inaccurate .

		Lord Buckhurst is spoken of -LRB- p. 275 -RRB- and indexed -LRB- p. 412 -RRB- by his title , one of his titles , only ; his name ,
Thomas Sackville	PERSON	, nowhere appears . ''

		Even a woman miniaturist ,
Alice Carmellian	PERSON	'' -LRB- p. 196 -RRB- is not recognized as
Ellis Carmyan	PERSON	, mentioned on page 77 , as a masque decorator .

		The ''
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary of National Biography '' records this person 's name as
Alice	LOCATION	, or
Ellis	PERSON	,
Carmylyon	PERSON	, and gives five variant spellings , --
Alice Car	PERSON	- millian ,
Alys Carmyllion	PERSON	,
Alis Carmylion	PERSON	,
Ellis Carmyan	PERSON	, and Elysys the painter .

		As to
Alice Carmylyon	PERSON	's being a miniaturist , the '' Dic - tionary '' says : '' It does not appear what foundation
John Gough Nichols	PERSON	has for his remark that ' she appears to have been a painter in miniature . ' ''

		Upon the point of sex , the same authority decides that there is '' no con - clusive evidence either way . ''

		A variation in kind from the confusion of a person with himself , or herself , is Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's making two different persons masquerade as one .

		On page 352
Unico Aretino	ORGANIZATION	is supposed to be
Pietro Aretino	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is confounding the fairly respectable , if rather conceited , Unico with the eminently unrespectable Pietro .

		Ber -
nardo Accolti	PERSON	, of
Arezzo	LOCATION	, was called the ''
Unico Aretino	PERSON	, '' from his '' unique '' faculty for ex - temporizing verse .

		Pietro
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	's name was
Pietro Bacci	PERSON	.

		These two persons did live at the same time , and in the same city .

		But
Francesco Patrizi	PERSON	, Bishop of
Gaeta	PERSON	-LRB- died 1494 -RRB- comes to life again -LRB- p. 293 -RRB- as
Francesco Patrizi	PERSON	-LRB- 1529-1597 -RRB- , and no bishop .

		Fran - oeaco
Patrizi	LOCATION	, Bishop of
Gaeta	LOCATION	, wrote '' De Regno et Hegis Institutione '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	,
1567	DATE	-RRB- , a book which was translated by
Richard Rob	PERSON	- inson , in
1576	DATE	, as `` A Moral Methode of Civile Policie , '' etc. .

		The other
Francesco Patrizi	PERSON	wrote , `` Delia Ilistoria diece dialoghi ... 7je ' quali si ragiona di tutte le cose ajjpartinenti air historioy et alio scriverla , et alU osservarla '' -LRB-
Venetia	LOCATION	, 1560 -RRB- .

		Thomas Blundeville trans - lated this book , in
1574	DATE	, under the title , '' The true order and Methode of wryting and read - ing Hystories according to the Precepts of Francisco Patricio , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	men - tions the first work on pages 293 and 301 : the other work is the one referred to on pages 309 and 313 .

		But on page 417 all the references are assigned to one person ,
F. Patrizi	PERSON	.

		Again , it fills the judicious reader with mis - givings to meet with many familiar titles which have been here transformed , and deformed .

		The Latin title just cited reads -LRB- p. 293 -RRB- '' Be Regno et Regio Institutione . ''


George Pettie	PERSON	's alliterative title '' A
Petite Pallace	PERSON	of
Pettie	PERSON	his Pleasure , '' becomes unintelligible -LRB- p. 364 -RRB- in ''
Pettie	PERSON	's Palace of
Pettie	PERSON	his Pleasure . ''

		A well-known book Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	knows as
J. R. Green	PERSON	's '' Short History of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 292 -RRB- .

		The most extraordinary made-up title occurs on page 362 , where Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	, writing on Italian fiction , produces a little fiction of his own .

		He says : ^ ^ Perimides and
Philomela	LOCATION	, for instance , was so closely imitated from
Boccaccio	PERSON	that it -LSB- ? -RSB-

		amounted almost to a translation '' ; and as authority for this state - ment , the '' Publications of the Modern Lan - guage Association '' -LRB-
1898	DATE	, p. 250 -RRB- is alleged .

		Turning to the '' Publications '' for
1895	DATE	, -LRB- '' Elizabethan Translations from the Italian '' -RRB- , on page 275 there is entered
Robert Greene	PERSON	's '' Perimides the Blacke-Smith '' ; and a few pages farther on -LRB- p. 278 -RRB- , `` Philomela , the Lady Fitzwaters Nightingale . ''

		On page 250 , in the preface to this article , which is on prose ro - mances from the Italian ,
Greene	PERSON	's imitation of Boccaccio is mentioned , and these romances are instanced as examples .

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	has run the two titles into one , and then given a reference that is wrong as to source , year , and paging .

		Can Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	have read the novels of
Robert Greene	PERSON	?

		It would seem to imply an almost hopeless inaccuracy of mind as to titles , to have to note of Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	that the work which has helped him most in writing his book , the `` Publication * of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' he calls everywhere -LRB- he cites it four times only -RRB- the '' Proceedings '' of that society .

		The '' Pro- ceedings '' is the report of the annual meeting of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, published every year ia No. 4 of the '' Publications . ''

		No one of Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's four references will be found in any of the * ' Proceedings . ''

		It is not the case , as stated on page 81 .

		that
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	della Casa 's '' Galatheo '' was trans - lated into French and Spanish before its ap - pearance in English , in
1596	DATE	.


Robert Peter	PERSON	- son 's translation of `` Galatheo '' was printed in

		The British Museum prossesses a copy of this imprint ; and an exemplar , imper - 268 THE DIAL -LSB-

Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first French trans - lation , that of Jean du Peyrat -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	, 1662 -RRB- did precede
Peterson	PERSON	's ; but the first Spanish translation , a very rare book , is dated nine years later .

		It is , '' Tratado llamado Galatheo ... Traduzido de lengua
Toscana en Castel	ORGANIZATION	- lano por el Doctor Domingo de Bezerra '' -LRB- ^ Venecia , 1685 -RRB- .

		A familiar

		There is a hasty reading here of
J. A. Gotch	PERSON	-LRB- '' Early Renaissance Architecture in
England	LOCATION	, '' p. 7 -RRB- .


Gotch	PERSON	attributes this characterization of the English correctly to

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's habit of inaccuracy passes over into matters of opinion .

		He says -LRB- p. 364 -RRB- that
John Drout	PERSON	's '' The Pityfull Historic of two louing Italians Gualfrido and
Barnardo	PERSON	le vayne '' was '' falsely stated to be a translation to mislead the reader . ''

		The '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, '' under
Drout	PERSON	's name , says : ''
Collier	PERSON	doubts whether
Drout	PERSON	really translated the story from the Italian , and sug - gests that
Drout	PERSON	describes it as a translation 80 that he might take advantage of the popu - larity of Italian novels . ''

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	gives no authority for his statement .

		If he has based it upon
Collier	PERSON	, it has but a shaky found - ation , for surely a doubt and a suggestion of
John Payne Collier	PERSON	do not make a matter of fact .

		The point is important because it illus - trates the curious facility of conjectures to get taken for facts by the next writer on the sub - ject .

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	himself is rather given to con - jectures , as when -LRB- p. 74 -RRB- he says that Saviolo on quarrels , or `` perhaps some similar sentence ... first suggested the dramatic possibilities of Romeo and Jidiet '' -- ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' of all tragedies , with its venerable antiquity and distinguished pedigree , in
Latin	LOCATION	, and even in
Greek	LOCATION	, Italian , French , Spanish , and En - glish .

		Or when -LRB- p. 168 -RRB- , repeating
R. L. Douglas	PERSON	-LRB- Introduction to '' Certain Tragical Discourses of Bandello , ''
Tudor Translations	ORGANIZATION	,
1898	DATE	, p. xlvii -RRB- , he says that Ascham , in cen - suring English translations of Italian books , '' had probably in mind
Fenton	PERSON	's translation of
Bandello	LOCATION	, dedicated to Lady
Mary Sidney	PERSON	. ''

		As a matter of fact ,
Fenton	PERSON	translated thir - teen novels only , and all of those from the French of
Belleforest	LOCATION	.

		If
Roger Ascham	PERSON	had any one book in mind , it was much more likely to have been Painter 's '' Palace of Pleasure . ''

		This is evident from the interpolation at the end of the first part of '' The Scholemaster , '' which , from internal evidence , must have been written about
1568	DATE	, the year after the ap - pearance of Painter 's
Second Tome	ORGANIZATION	.

		At that time .

		Painter had published ninety-four nov - els , largely from the Italian .

		Volume I. , sixty novels , is practically a Boccaccio book ; Volume II. , thirty-four novels , a Bandello book .

		The index leaves much to be desired .

		Very few titles get into it at all , and a large majority of persons are indexed without their Christian names or initials .

		This leads to the confusion of persons , even by the author himself .

		Names in the foot-notes now and then stray into the index , but most of them are omitted .

		Many of the foot-notes are inaccurate .

		The refer - ences at the bottom of page 92 are cited as from ''
Castiglione	PERSON	'' ; they refer in fact to
Thomas Hoby	PERSON	's translation of
Castiglione	PERSON	, `` The Book of the Courtier '' -LRB- probably the `` Tudor Translations '' reprint ,
1900	DATE	-RRB- .

		Mrs.
T. R. Green	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 258 and 259 -RRB- should read Mrs.
J. R. Green	PERSON	.


Richard Mulcaster	PERSON	's '' The First Part of the Elementarie '' is cited -LRB- p. 164 -RRB- simply '' Elementary , '' without author 's name , without date , without the original spelling .

		So vague a reference is useless .

		Many of the mistakes in this book arise , doubtless , from the author 's youth and haste .

		They might have been avoided by sounder know - ledge and closer attention to details .

		A very serious fault has been noticed by the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum . ''

		The English reviewer points out , that in the making of his book Mr.
Ein	PERSON	- stein has been indebted , more than his own statement of the case would seem to indicate , to an earlier work , ''
Elizabethan Translations	ORGANIZATION	from the Italian . ''

		The facts referred to by '' The Athenaeum '' are these : There ap - peared in the '' Publications of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' 1895-1899 , four arti - cles on `` Elizabethan Translations from the Italian . ''

		Of the 187 Printed Sources of in - formation set forth in Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's biblio - graphy , 106 , or more than half , are to be found in the '' Elizabethan Translations from the Italian . ''

		There can be no doubt about Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's having found them there , for he uses material from the ''
Elizabethan Transla	ORGANIZATION	-

		THE DIAIi 269 tions from the Italian '' in his text and foot - notes more than 100 times .

		No fewer than 64 works for the first time collected and annotated in ' • Elizabethan Translations from the Italian '' are qnoted in Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's footnotes without reference to the source of authority .

		Further , some 72 of these works are mentioned in Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's text , most of them without any foot - notes .

		On page 336 of the '' Elizabethan Transla - tions '' a quotation from
Roger Aseham	PERSON	is im - mediately followed by one from Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	; on page 108 of the '' Italian Renaissance in
England	LOCATION	'' the same juxtaposition of authori - ties occurs , but the references cite the original ■ works .

		On pages 61 and 62 of the '' Elizabethan Translations '' ' there is a discussion of the in - fluence of the Mantuan on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Spenser	PERSON	; the same subject is treated on pages 347 and 348 of the ' • Italian Renaissance in
England	LOCATION	, '' with the same references , but cited as from the original , except that a quotation from
Drake	PERSON	's '' Shakspeare and his Times , '' is transferred to the more recent '' Life of Shakspere '' by Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		The ident - ity of authorities in this instance represents such an unusual concatenation of persons as
Mantuanus	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Alexander Barclay	PERSON	, ^ neas
Sylvius Piccolomini	PERSON	, and
F. Kluge	PERSON	.

		Surely Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	has failed to meet the moral obligations here involved by acknowl - edging his indebtedness to the '' Elizabethan Translations from the Italian ' '' twice only throughout his book , and by the cursory sen - tence in his preface which probably led to '' The Athenaeum 's '' criticism .

		Nor is it the author of '' Elizabethan Trans - lations from the Italian '' alone who may justly object to Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's too free borrowing .

		For the
Italianization of Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	closely follows an article by Professor
R. E. Xeil Dodge	PERSON	on '' Spenser 's Imitations from
Ariosto	PERSON	. ''

		He calls the paper '' Imitations from
Ariosto	PERSON	, '' and cites it `` Proceedings -LSB- sic -RSB-
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	,
1897	DATE	. ''

		Pro- fessor Dodges name is nowhere mentioned .

		The references in the foot-notes to page 342 , unacknowledged there , and with one of the Spenser citations incorrect , may be found on pagesl82 and 183 of Professor
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's article in the '' Publications of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		So , also , the striking phrase * ' reflective and picturesque , '' describing the total effect of > • The Faerie Queene '' -LRB- Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	, p. 343 -RRB- , is Professor Dodge 's -LRB- `` Pub - lications , ''
1897	DATE	, pp. 183-4 -RRB- .

		While it is the scholar 's happy privilege to use freely the published results of the labors of others , this privilege carries with it the equally happy duty of acknowledging its exercise .

		To neglect the duty is to abuse the privilege .

		Reckst Texts ix LiITKrature .

		* We have had many school manuals of Am - erican literature , but none more readable than the '' Introduction to the Study of American Literature '' which has been prepared by Pro- fessor
William Cranston Lawton	PERSON	.

		It is not easy to make a book of this sort readable , and many authors do not attempt the task .

		Those who do are apt to place their main reliance upon attention to a few great names and move - ments , ignoring the minor matters that can make a page so forbidding .

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	has not shirked the obligation to give his treat - ment some degree of completeness -LRB- although the scale is small -RRB- , and many of his pages are crowded with names and titles .

		But even where they come together most thickly he contrives to introduce a fresh phrase or a telling epithet that has a wonderful way of lighting up the text .

		He is naively personal at times , as when after his account of
Poe	PERSON	, he speaks of it as '' the present rather hostile study , '' and calls Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	'' as sympathetic a biographer and expositor as any healthy human nature with temperate blood is ever likely to prove . ''

		A still more personal note is found in these words upon
Lydia Maria	PERSON	Child : `` As for the exact liter '' py rank of this heroic woman , the critical scales must be passed to younger and cooler hands .

		In the homes of a ' few original
Garrisonians	PERSON	' her earlv books were still cherished .

		We learned to read , that we might not be dependent on our busy el - ders for daily absorption in her ' Flowers for Children . '

		Our own of & pring seem to detect a moral and Edge - worthian flavor in the cherished volume , and prefer ' Little Women . '

		270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, The ■ Letters from
New York	LOCATION	' widened the vista of a village street to our boyish eyes . ''

		We doubt very much if such confessions as these belong in a school history of literature , but we are sure that they will be grateful to readers who are not school children .

		And it is certainly not for a juvenile audience that Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	has penned words such as these : '' Mr
Aldrich	PERSON	recalls a previous incarnation on the banks of old
Nile	ORGANIZATION	; and , indeed , so far as pure and seri - ous art , with a dash of dreamy idealism still , may drift from the austerer tradition of Puritanism , he has de - parted ... His best short stories have a large vein of mis - chief and mystification .

		His lunger novels perhaps lack somewhat the justification of broad view or large ethical purpose , but all the too little that he writes is enjoyed . ''

		These sentences are altogether typical of Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	's manner , and explain why he has made a book so interesting to mature minds , al - beit one not likely to appeal to school children .

		We defy the average child to make any thing out of such a delightful paragraph as that on a later page devoted to ''
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	. ''

		We certainly can not quarrel with Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	for giving us a book so much better than any mere school book has a right to be , but there are one or two minor points of criticism that must not be omitted .

		No one , from the ac - count of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's `` Christus , '' could get any exact notion of the plan and structure of that work .

		And it is certainly not true that , as a result of the Civil War , '' There is to be but one Anglo-Saxon nation on this conti - nent . ''

		These , and a few other instances of careless statement , are the trifling defects of a work which is packed with ideas and allusions , which has an unfailing freshness of touch , and which deserves to extend its influences far be - yond the bounds of the school room .

		A more leisurely treatment of our literary annals , designed for the general reader rather than for the uses of schools , is the work of Professor
Lorenzo Sears	PERSON	, and is entitled `` Amer - ican Literature in its Colonial and National Pe - riods . ''

		The author is in sympathy with his subject , and writes from a wide first-hand acquaintance with the literature which he discusses .

		He introduces many illustrative quotations , and they prove to be surprisingly unhackneyed , although quite as typical of their authors as the excerpts commonly met with in works of this description .

		The book is dis - tinctly the author 's own , and not the compila - tion of earlier compilations which a text-book of our literature is so apt to be .

		It is , moreover , distinguished by sobriety of judgment , and its originality is not gained by paradoxical opinions or startling departures from the views generally accepted .

		Mr.
Sears	PERSON	does not make himself the champion of any particular man or set of men at the expense of others , nor does he seek to attract attention by any eccentricities of manner .

		He is the master of a flowing and graceful style which always pleases , and which leaves a pleasant memory behind .

		As far as we may say that his book has a method , it is that of dividing his subject into neat com - partments , each of his nearly two score chap - ters being given either to a single author or to a clearly-defined group , such as '' Ply - mouth Diarists , '' `` The Knickerbocker | Group , '' '' Southern Orators , '' and `` American Humor . ''

		This method inevitably results in omissions that sometimes seem serious , or to the slurring over of names that one would like to see ac - corded a more conspicuous treatment .

		The most notable illustration of this defect is found in the failure to give adequate attention to the `` transcendental '' movement in
New England	LOCATION	.

		We have separate chapters on
Emerson	PERSON	and
Thoreau	PERSON	, but '' The Dial '' is not so much a '' named , and mere mention of her name is the only notice taken of
Margaret Fuller	ORGANIZATION	.

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	should have something to say on this subject .

		A convenient reading list is appended to the work .

		The '' Student 's History of English Liter - ature '' which has been written by Professor
W. E. Simonds	PERSON	is a book after the conven - tional pattern , prepared with close reference to the needs of schools , and crammed with in - formation .

		As far as it has distinguishing characteristics , they may be summarized by saying that more than the usual attention is given to English history , to the biographies of authors , and to matters of philological inter - est. .

		The illustrations are singularly interest - ing , being mostly facsimiles of the printed or manuscript page and old wood-cuts and drawings .

		The bibliographical matter is un - usually copious , and the book is well provided with questions , exercises , and other matters helpful from a pedagogical point of view .

		Ex - tracts are introduced in considerable numbers , but they are so brief that they do not crowd unfairly the historical and critical text .

		Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	is careful in his judgments of authors to present the approved views of criticism rather than any fancies of his own .

		This makes him a safe guide , and he is also an em - inently readable one .

		The volume ends with a literary map of
England	LOCATION	and an elaborate in - dex which calls for a word of special praise .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 Mr.
Henry S. Pancoast	PERSON	, whose histories of English and American literature , with the ac - companying volumes of standard selections , have met with such wide and well-deserved favor , has added to the series a book of '' Standard English Prose , '' the selections rang - ing from
Bacon	LOCATION	to
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The selections are reasonably long , and in nearly all cases are complete compositions .

		This method necessi - tates the omission altogether of some writers for whom we should naturally look , but the thirty-five who are represented provide a goodly variety of styles , and illustrate all of the highly important phases in the development of our prose literature .

		Fifteen of the number are writers of the last century , and those belong - ing strictly to our own time are
Newman	PERSON	,
Froude	PERSON	,
Kuskin	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Pater	PERSON	, and
Stevenson	PERSON	-- a judicious selection , on the whole .

		The longest selection in the volume is Macaulay 's ''
Milton	PERSON	. ''

		In an appendix we are given brief examples of a few of the earlier prose writers , from
Wyclif	LOCATION	to
Sidney	PERSON	, and then comes a body of notes filling a hundred pages .

		`` A Study of Prose Fiction , '' by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, is not entirely a book for school uses , although it had its origin in a course of college lectures , and includes practical exercises for students of literature .

		No one could be better qualified than Mr.
Perry	PERSON	for the production of a treatise of this sort , for his connection with the art of story-writing is of a three-fold char - acter , practical , pedagogical , and editorial .

		He puts the case , over-modestly , in these terms : '' It happened that the author wrote fiction , after a fashion , before attempting to lecture upon it , and he is now conscious that the academic point of view has in turn been modified by the impressions gained during his editorship of ` The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	. '

		Whether the professional examination of many thousands of man - nscript stories is calculated to exhalt one 's standards of the art of fiction may possibly be questioned .

		But this editorial experience , supplementing the other methods of approach to the subject , may be thought to contrib - ute something of practical value to the present study of the novelist 's work . ''

		The book is based upon the thesis '' that as the traveller who has studied architecture most carefully will get the most pleasure out of a cathedral , so the thorough student of literary art will receive most enjoyment from the master - pieces which that art has produced . ''

		A corol - lary of this proposition is that literature -LRB- in - cluding fiction -RRB- has its laws and the criticism thereof its canons ; that the business of the critic is to be acquainted with the former and to apply the latter to whatever case he may have at hand .

		He '' takes for granted that there is a body of doctrine concerning fiction , as there is concerning paintings or architec - ture or music and that the artistic principles involved are no more incapable of formulation than are the laws of the art of poetry , as expressed in treatises upon Poetics from Aris - totle 's day to our own . ''

		Or , as the matter is neatly expressed in a later paragraph , '' that
Aristotle	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	, in short , wrote with one eye on Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	. ''

		So Mr.
Perry	PERSON	proceeds to discuss the principles of the art of fiction under such heads as fiction and the drama , fiction and science , the characters , the plot , realism , and romanticism .

		And at every stage of the discussion , he enforces his theoretical points by the most felicitous of illustrations .

		If we were to choose among Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's thirteen chapters those which strike the deepest root , we could not be far astray in singling out the twin discussions of realism and romanticism .

		Here we find an analysis which leaves nothing nnsaid that is essential , and which shows us , by implication , how futile is the greater part of the controversial literature that has been devoted to this dual theme , how foolish it is for a man to attach to himself or his work either label .

		And the writer now and then takes a firm grasp upon the ethics of literary art , as in the following passage : '' There are thousands of good people who are shocked -- as perhaps they ought to be -- by a story that de - scribes in plain terms the yielding of a young man to sexual temptations , but who are not shocked in the least by a story that glorifies brute force , sings the praise of war , and teaches that for the individual or the nation it is might that makes right . ''

		With this fine sentiment we take a reluctant leave of this book , which is deserving of very high praise , both for the sanity of its teaching and for the unfailing charm of its manner .

		The Stort of
Helen Keller	PERSON	.

		* Sixty-five years ago Dr.
S. G. Howe	PERSON	of Bos - ton gave forth the then somewhat startling an - nouncement that he was educating a child de - prived of sight and hearing .

		The results of his instruction of
Laura Bridgman	PERSON	were widely heralded over the civilized world .

		When in

Helen Keller	PERSON	.

		With her letters , and a supplementary account of her edncation by
John Albert Macy	PERSON	.

		lUostrated .

		New York :
Donbleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		272 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, of seven years of age , the difficulties of the task were far better understood .

		The possibili - ties of an education in spite of the curtailment of the ordinary avenues of knowledge ob - viously depend upon the individual gifts of the subject .

		Everyone knows that
Helen Keller	PERSON	was a remarkable child and has grown to be a remarkable young woman .

		The story of her life is now published in adequate form , and serves to intensify , as well as to rationalize , the note of admiration which everywhere greets an account of her achievements .

		The volume consists of an autobiography , of a well-selected selection of her letters written from her seventh to her twenty-first year , and of an account of her instruction , prepared largely by
Miss Sullivan	PERSON	, with additional com - ments by the editor of the volume , Mr.
J. A. Macy	PERSON	.

		All three collaborators have done their work well ; and especial attention should be directed to the value of Miss
Sullivan	PERSON	's letters written at the time of her taking charge of
Helen Keller	PERSON	, and now for the first time given to the public .

		These letters indicate an appre - ciation of the psychological and educational problems involved in bringing up a bright but sightless and silent child , which one would have expected from the result , but which it is most assuring to read in print as a contemporaneous record .

		In a letter written only a few months after she found her way to the mind of her charge ,
Miss Sullivan	PERSON	writes : '' No one can see her without being impressed .

		She is no ordi - nary child , and peoples ' interest in her education will be no ordinary interest .

		Therefore let us be exceedingly careful what we say and write about her . ''

		Miss
Sullivan	PERSON	was fortunately free from adherence to any pet theory or method , but was able to adapt sound principles of edu - cation to the special conditions that were set before her .

		The result is that
Miss Keller	PERSON	to - day participates freely in most of the intellect - ual life of her age .

		The book in the main is
Helen Keller	PERSON	's book , and the interest in her is a genuine interest in her personality ; for , as Miss
Sullivan	PERSON	well says ,
Laura Bridgman	PERSON	remained to the end of her days a curiosity , but
Helen Keller	PERSON	has been almost from the outset a distinct personality .

		One of the ways to suggest the interest of the narrative will be the presentation of a few ex - tracts , which show the young woman as she is today , -- a student at
Radcliffe	LOCATION	, with all the interests of a student and the enthusiasm of youth .

		Like many students , she often grows rebellious at methods that do not suit her tem - perament ; but , unlike many students , she has a greater fertility in expressing her impatience .

		In a theme recently submitted in the course in literature , she writes as follows : `` Ah !

		the pranks that the nixies of Dreamland play on us while we sleep !

		Methinks they are ` jesters at the court of heaven . '

		They frequently take the shape of daily themes to mock me .

		They strut about on the stage of sleep like the foolish virgins , only they carry well - trimmed notebooks in their hands instead of empty lamps .

		At other times they examine and cross ex - amine me in all the studies I have ever had , invariably asking me questions as easy to answer as this : ' What was the name of the first mouse that worried
Hippo	PERSON	- potamus , satrap of
Cambridge	LOCATION	under Astyagas , grand - father of Cyrus the Great ? '

		I awake terror-stricken , with the words ringing in my ears -- ' An answer or your life ! ' ''

		Examinations come in for a considerable share of her disdain . ''

		The days before these ordeals take place are spent in the cramming of your mind with mystic formulse and indigestible dates , unpalatable diets , until you wish that books and science and you were buried in the depths of the sea ... ' Give a brief account of
Huss	PERSON	and his work . '

		Huss ?

		Who was he and what did he do ?

		The name looks familiar .

		You ransack your budget of historic facts much as you hunt for a bit of silk in a rag-bag .

		You are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the top -- you saw it there the other day when you were looking up the beginnings of the Reformation .

		But where is it now ?

		You fish out all manner of odds and ends of knowledge -- revolutions , schisms , massacres , systems of government ; but
Huss	PERSON	-- where is he ?

		You are amazed at all the things you know which are not on the examination paper .

		In desperation you seize the bud - get and dump everything out , and there in the corner is your man , serenely brooding on his own private thought , unconscious of the catastrophe which he has brought upon you .

		Just then the proctor informs you that the time is up . ''


Helen Keller	PERSON	's talk is as good as her writing .

		She is quick at repartee , anxious to give and take , and has an unusual sense of humour .

		When Dr.
Furness	PERSON	warned her not to credit too implicitly all that her Harvard professors might tell her about the life of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of whom we know only that he was baptized , married , and died , her answer was ready : '' Well , he seems to have done all the essential things . ''

		Her letters , often conversational in tone , reflect the temper of her character .

		She is ever fond of a dig at the rigid requirements of study that do not bear upon the human side of life . ''

		I am sure the daisies and buttercups have as little use for the science of Geometry as I , in spite of the fact that they so beautifully illus - trate its principles . '' ''

		I detest grammar as much as you do ; but I suppose I must go through it if I am to write , just as we had to get ducked in the lake hundreds of times before we could swim ! ''

		Her philosophy is
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 278 naturally of a piece with her passion for the humanities ; it is often quaintly practical . ''

		I hope , '' she writes '' that L. is n't too practical , for if she is , I ' m afraid she will miss a great deal of pleasure . ''

		When the question of her taking a regular course at college was at issue , she writes to a friend : '' I found it hard , very hard , to give up the idea of going to college ; it had been in my mind ever since I was a little girl ; but there is no use doing a foolish thing , because one has wanted to do it a long time , is there ? ''

		She writes to the instructor in literature at
Radcli #	ORGANIZATION	fe : `` When I came to your class last
October	DATE	, I was trying with all my might to be like everybody else , to forget as entirely as possible my limitations and pecu - liar environment .

		Now , however , I see the folly of attempting to hitch one 's wagon to a star with harness that does not belong to it . ''

		A young woman of twenty-two who writes and talks like this ; who is equally enthusiastic over a walk in the woods or a sail on the water as over the treasures of Homer or Shakes - peare ; who can become absorbed over a game of checkers or solitaire ; who is as much con - vulsed by the nonsense of
Lear	PERSON	or the clever topsyturvydom of ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' as the most ardent devotee of those ministers to the gaiety of life ; whose knowledge of the history of the race is extensive and accurate , as her appreciation of literature is sincere and com - prehensive ; who converses in two or three lan - guages and reads as many more ; who counts among her friends the most gifted and the most eminent contributors to the intellectual life of the day ; -- surely such a life can hardly be spoken of as an uninteresting or impover - ished one for any person of modest years .

		We can not forget that these achievements and the privileges that they have brought , are those of one who knows no color and hears no sound , whose avenues of communion with the world are at the best indirect and awkward , and for whom many of the most intimate facilities for keeping aglow the torch of learning are ever beyond reach .

		Yet the most sincere testimony to the inherent value of her narrative is that in reading it one is often more engrossed by the sentiment and the vigor of what is said than by the peculiar condition of the writer .

		The story of how all this was accomplished is one of pronounced interest to the educator and to the psychologist ; its interest is not a technical one , however , and is sure to find a wide circle of readers .

		It seemed important to call attention in these columns to the literary attractiveness of this remarkable human docu - ment , and to arouse an interest in the develop - ment of
Helen Keller	PERSON	's mind by indicating , however inadequately , the personality of the young junior at
Radcliffe	LOCATION	.

		-LSB-
April 16	DATE	, secondary character of much of the work done in American colleges .

		These are points of minor im - portance , however .

		This history of secondary edu - cation is the most creditable and considerable book on American education yet published . ''

		The
Making of Citizens	ORGANIZATION	, a Study in
Compara	LOCATION	- tive Education , '' is the somewhat misleading title of a recent volume in the '' Contemporary Science Series '' by Prof.
R. E. Hughes	PERSON	.

		This work aims to do for the English-speaking public what
M. Levasseur	PERSON	has done for
France	LOCATION	in the way of pre - senting in a systematic form the most important facts concerning schools .

		Prof.
Hughes	PERSON	confines himself to the schools of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Ger	PERSON	- many , and the
United States	LOCATION	, and treats of the primary school system , the secondary school sys - tem , the education of girls and of defective child - ren .

		Not satisfied with important statistics and the framework of the school code , Prof.
Hughes	PERSON	points out the relation which these facts bear to the ' vital problems facing each nation .

		This method adds greatly to the interest of the book .

		The au - thor is free from bias , and sees the main educa - tional problems in proper perspective .

		His knowl - edge of the details of some of the school systems , particularly the American , is limited and leads to a namber of questionable statements , such as the following : '' American children seem to be losing the faculty of play '' p. 173 ; '' The primary schools of
America	LOCATION	do not meet the needs ... of the great body of German and Scandinavian immigrants '' p. 193 ; `` In
America	LOCATION	, ... the real vocation of a public secondary school to act as an intermediate step to a university has been largely abandoned to private secondary schools '' p. 203 - Prof.
John E. Adamson	PERSON	, in his '' Theory of Ed - ucation in
Plato	LOCATION	's ' Republic , ' '' has produced a closely-considered logical analysis of the pedagog - ical sections of the '' Republic . ''

		This analysis , however , forms only the introductory portion of the various chapters , which treat of such topics as the substance of literature , the form of literature , melody and rhythm , and gymnastic culture .

		Prof.
Adamson	PERSON	's chief aim is to show us the signifi - cance of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's standpoint in a modern philosophy of education .

		Our education to-day is too complex in its machinery , too many-sided in its interests ; under the leadership of individualists like
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Locke	PERSON	, we have lost sight of the simple social aims of education ; hence '' Back to Plato ! ''

		should be our cry : -- this in brief is our author 's thesis .

		In thus endeavoring to apply
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's theories to the needs of the twentieth century , he has essayed a difficult undertaking , but in a large measure he has succeeded .

		The book lacks neither maturity , logical precision , nor suggestiveness .

		It is well adapted to serve as a basis for discussion in that well-nigh obsolete subject , -- the philosophy of ed - ucation .

		Prof.
Adamson	PERSON	does not attempt to trace Plato 's indebtedness , or compare his suggestions with the practice of the Athenians ; he ignores Aristotle and all succeeding classical writers on ed - ucation .

		This method of treating
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's educa - tional ideas , as largely the result of his own creative genius , is likely to lead unwary readers to a highly - exaggerated notion of the originality of the great Athenian .

		The theory of interest recently set forth by Dr.
John Dewey	PERSON	is the central theme in Prof. De Garmo 's '' Interest and Education : The Doc - trine of Interest and its Concrete Application . ''

		According to this view , pleasurable excitement in connection with study does not of itself constitute true interest .

		Pleasurable excitement can only be termed interest when it is the result of a persistent effort to attain ends in the interest of self-expression .

		The first four chapters of Prof. De
Garmo	PERSON	's book cover the theoretical considerations ; the remaining eleven deal with the application of the new stand - point to such educational questions as elective stud - ies , motor training , and methods .

		Perhaps the most useful chapters for teachers are those on the art of exposition and the art of questioning .

		The book is well written , and several of the chapters contain clever bits of characterization .

		An unconventional treatment of a shop-worn subject is found in Prof.
Frank Cramer	PERSON	's '' Talks to Students on the Art of Study . ''

		An outline of psychological theory drawn largely from Prof.
James	PERSON	provides the framework of the book , but does not determine its character .

		Its aim is not '' to fill the place of a manual of logic , psychology , or pedagogy , '' but to '' furnish effective suggestion to the student who is passing through the critical period of his intellectual life . ''

		The author is as good as his word .

		From a wide and varied ex - perience , he has gathered a number of apt and tell - ing illustrations which he states with unusual force and earnestness .

		The difficulties in the formation of correct intellectual habits are made sufficiently concrete to strike home to the average student of the late high school or early college period .

		Like many writers with a similar practical aim in view , Prof.
Cramer	PERSON	exaggerates the role of the individual 's volitions ; this very exaggeration , however , tends to increase the pedagogical efficiency of the work .

		It is a stirring appeal for correct habits in thinking .

		The second part of Miss
Mary E. Wilson	PERSON	's translation of
M. Gabriel Compayr	PERSON	^ 's '' L' E volution Intellectuelle et Moral de I ` Eafant '' has been pub - lished as the fifty-third volume of the `` International Education Series . ''

		This portion of the translation is entitled '' Development of the Child in Later In - fancy . ''

		The topics here treated are the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- imitation and curiosity , -LRB- 2 -RRB- judgment and rea - son , -LRB- 3 -RRB- learning to speak , -LRB- 4 -RRB- walking and play , -LRB- 5 -RRB- development of the moral sense , -LRB- 6 -RRB- weak and strong points of character , -LRB- 7 -RRB- morbid tendencies , and -LRB- 8 -RRB- sense of selfhood .

		Many of the chapters are as essential to the student of ethics and sociology as to the genetic psychologist .

		The clearness and charm of the author 's style and his use of literary as well as scientific sources for the study of children will tend to secure for him a wider circle of read -

		THE DIAJ ^ 275 en than similar books have g ^ ained .

		His present book is withoat doubt the most complete treatment of the child daring infancy accessible to the Amer - ean reader .

		The most valaable feature of Dr.
Charles McMarry	PERSON	's '' Special Method in the Reading of Com - plete English Classics in the Grades of the Com - mon School '' is a earef ally-prepared bibliography of children 's classics .

		For the period beginning with the fourth grade and ending at the first year of the high school .

		Dr.
McMurry	PERSON	has arranged three par - allel lists of books .

		In the first colamn he places Tolames suitable for class-room use .

		In the second column are the supplementary reference books valu - able for children bat not sufficiently finished in their literary form to justify their inclusion in the first col - amn .

		The third colamn contains books for teachers , chiefly history , biography , literature , and pedagogy ; this list needs further classification These three lists have been submitted to a number of superin - tendents , and revised in the light of their criticism .

		Critical and descriptive notes are freqaent , and an exhaustive enumeration of the various inexpensive editions , with the names of their publishers , is in - cluded .

		While the average teacher may take an exception to some title here and there as too ad - vanced for the grade 8i > eeified , in general Dr.
McMarry	PERSON	has provided a highly satisfactory guide for children 's reading both at home and at school .

		Pedagogical chapters full of excellent suggestions and valuable quotations occupy the bulk of the vol - ume .

		It is unfortunate that so useful a book shoold be marred by an occasional touch of sentimentality .

		Simultaneously with the volume just mentioned is published a new edition of ■ ' The Method of Re - citation , '' by Professors
Charles A.	PERSON	and
Frank M. McMurry	PERSON	.

		In mechanical setting , the new edition is a great improvement on the old .

		Marginal notes in small tyi > e add greatly to the usefulness of the work as a text-book .

		The majority of the chapters remain substantially identical in the two editions , but a few of the later ones have been entirely remod - eled .

		The chapter on • ' Socratic Method '' in the old edition is here omitted , and a new section on model lessons is included .

		The changes have aU been made in the interests of greater clearness and compactness , bat in no way do they alter the general character of
Hkxbt Davidson Sheumk	ORGANIZATION	.

		BKIKF8 ox Nk ^ t Books .

		In quantity increasing annually , the piteajnma * literature of the Civil War period C `` r `` War .

		grows upon the American reading public .

		The latest contributions to the stock of this class of books are in one respect the most valaable .

		Distance of time has given a broader view of the pe - culiar relations between the two parties to the inter - necine strife , and asperity and distrust have on both sides given way to a more amiable and appreciative feeling respecting those who were once enemies .

		As
Bulwer	PERSON	's soldier phrased it , '' We always think more highly of a man after having fought with him . ''

		Two recent volumes of Civil War reminiscences , one presenting the Federal and the other the Con - federate side , illustrate this kindlier view that the retrospect of the present day furnishes of a contest that once manifested only bitterness .

		Mr.
Daniel Wait Howe	PERSON	, who was once an
Indiana	LOCATION	soldier and officer , presents under the title of ' • Civil War Times '' -LRB- Bo wen-Merrill -RRB- , an entertaining and in - structive recital , which combines his own personal experiences in camp , on the march , and on the field , with a running commentary covering the leading and prominent events of the entire war period .

		Though this combination results in a sort of melange , criti - cism of the oddity of this form of literary compto - sition is disarmed by the fidelity and accuracy which distinguish the historical portions of the book , and the agreeable ingenuousness of the per - sonal recollections .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is a fearless censor of the incompetency and bungling and jealousj whicn too often marked the conduct of prominent Federal officers ; but he is also the bold champion of the fame and honor of such generals as
George H. Thomas	PERSON	, who won his admiration , and in snch cases he gives good reasons , found in his own ex - perience and observation , for the praise he bestows .

		His accounts of the operations of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Cumberland	LOCATION	, during the battles of
Stone River	LOCATION	,
Chickamauga	LOCATION	.

		and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, and the East Ten - nessee and
Atlanta	LOCATION	campaigns , are so full and cir - cumspect as to merit the name of fair military history .

		The author 's personal reminiscences , includ - ing the extracts from his diaries of the time , serve to present a living picture of camp life and field ex - periences in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army in the South .

		-- A cor - responding picture of the like experiences of the Confederate officers and soldiers in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	army -LRB-
Virginia	LOCATION	-RRB- , aa seen by the yoang and viva - cious wife of a Soathern officer , is presented ander the title of - A
Virginia	LOCATION	Girl in the Civil War '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		The recollections of this lady -- who is given , in their recital , the name of Mrs.
Daniel Grey	PERSON	-- are collected and edited for her by Mrs.
Myrta Lockett Avary	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Her story of the vicissitudes of her army life , her joarneys with or in the wake of the command in which her hus - band was serving , her life in camp or barracks , her services in hospital , her anxieties in the time of bat - tle and the dangers from foes and the elements which she encoantered , her passing of the blockade and her hardships as a prisoner , all are portrayed with a vividness of recollection that brings the reader of today into some appreciation of the stren - uous character of the army life of that time .

		Throughout the narrative , the zeal of devotion to the '' bonnie blue flag '' and the cause it represented is tempered by a recognition of the manly and no - ble qualities exhibited in many of the officers and soldiers of the Federal army whom the sparkling Southern lady encountered .

		It is out of such sketches of personal experience , prepared by the participants 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, themselves , when kept free from all harshness and bitterness of feeling , and animated by appreciation of the real worth of the citizen-soldiers of the American armies on both sides , that the true and faithful history of the Civil War is yet to be , in large part , drawn .

		A ^ mmaryos ^ ^ ^ ry acceptable resume , of the English consiiia - history of
England	LOCATION	in its constitu - iwnai history .

		tional aspects , and one that promises to prove of great usefulness to students , is the work of Mrs.
Lucy Dale	PERSON	, a student of
Somerville College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		It bears the title of '' The Principles of English Constitutional History '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- ; but a title more explanatory of the scope and objects of the work would have been '' A Summary of English Constitutional History . ''

		It is a rapid but discriminating statement , in review , of the progress and development of constitutionalism in
England	LOCATION	, from the Roman period to the early part of the nineteenth century .

		The salient facts of each recurring epoch , as gleaned from the standard his - tories , are set forth in the form of the author 's con - clusions , and with a brevity that seems dogmatic .

		Such would appear to be the author 's chosen method , as she has abstained from citing authorities to sup - port the averments of her text .

		We infer that her aim is to furnish a treatise for students , to follow their reading in the general popular histories , and to serve them as a guide to the closer study of the fundamentals of government , as disclosed in the works of the constitutional historians .

		We are of opinion that the work will well serve to fill this place in the curriculum of students of these sub - jects .

		What were the inner meanings of the changes which were experienced during the centuries by that anomalous system called the English Consti - tution are here pointed out , briefly and succinctly , but always clearly .

		For instance , the devotion of the English people to both the institutions of the kingship and the parliament is kept before the student as a principle continuously asserting itself ; and the Restoration of the Stuarts is shown to exhibit a new assertion of that principle , rather than an undue fondness for a particular family of monarchs .

		This summary history of 440 pages is followed by a condensed '' Analysis of Con - tents , '' in fifteen pages , which is in itself a brief con - spectus of the entire body of the work , showing almost at a glance , and in the most convenient form , the successive constitutional aspects which have been more copiously illustrated in the twelve chapters of the work .

		If we mistake not , Mrs.
Dale	PERSON	's treatise will prove quite acceptable to his - torical study classes connected with clubs , as well as to those in the higher schools .


Sheridan	PERSON	's plays , ^ r.
W. Fraser Rae	PERSON	, already known printed as he as a careful student of
Richard	PERSON	wrote them .


Brinsley Sheridan	PERSON	's life and times , as evinced in his biography of the playwright , has now given us ''
Sheridan	PERSON	's Plays , Now Printed as he Wrote Them , and his Mother 's Unpublished Comedy , ' A Journey to Bath ' '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
David Nutt	PERSON	-RRB- .

		An Introduction by
Sheridan	PERSON	's great - grandson , the Marquess of
Dufferin	ORGANIZATION	and
Ava	PERSON	, adds interest to the work , which is increased by Mr.
Rae	PERSON	's profuse '' Prefatory Notes . ''

		From these last it may be learned that ''
Sheridan	PERSON	's grandfather '' -LRB- evidently a misprint for '' father , '' the grandfather having died in
1738	DATE	-RRB- '' gave much time and care to arranging the manuscripts of ' The Rivals , ' ' The Duenna , ' ' The School for Scandal , ' and ' The Critic , ' and he had them bound in handsome vol - umes . ''

		It is from these that the present edition is prepared ; and it appears that not only are all the editions now in print taken from the acting versions , as distinguished from the author 's , but the edition published by
Murray	PERSON	in
1821	DATE	, and usually regarded as definitive , was edited by
Wilkie	PERSON	on the good old simple plan of striking out the things he did not like and saying nothing about them . ''

		The Rivals , '' however , is not taken from the author 's first manu - script , which is thought to have perished with the burning of
Covent Garden Theatre	ORGANIZATION	.

		What is stated in several modern authorities to be a rumor , -- that '' The Rivals '' was ill-received on its first produc - tion , owing largely to the poor presentation made by Mr.
Lee	PERSON	of the part of Sir
Lucius O'Trigger	PERSON	, -- is finally confirmed by Mr.
Rae	PERSON	, who makes copious citations from the contemporary daily press in proof , and makes it all the more to be regretted that the original manuscript has not survived to tell the world what changes were made in the eleven days that elapsed between the first and second presen - tations , the success of the piece being thereby achieved .

		But
Sheridan	PERSON	himself prepared a copy of '' The Rivals '' for publication , which is followed here ; and this differs in several respects from the acting version with which modern play-goers are fa - miliar .

		Lord
Dufferin	ORGANIZATION	's Introduction is interesting rather than important , and contains some sentences setting forth that nobleman 's conceptions of his an - cestor 's principal characters .

		The critic will thank Mr.
Rae	PERSON	for his inclusion of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's mother 's fragmentary composition , '' A Journey to Bath , '' since the son made use of it , though the use is slight at best , and is not shown in '' The Rivals , '' as some - times alleged , but in '' The School for Scandal . ''

		In the latter part of the sixteenth century there lived , in a small tene - ment in Dean 's Yard ,
Westminster	LOCATION	,
William Camden	PERSON	, an old man who had been Head - master of
Westminster School	ORGANIZATION	, and was then
Clar	PERSON	- encieux King-at-Arms under Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	.

		He was also an antiquary and annalist .

		To his fond - ness for `` diverting '' himself among the tombs and ancient monuments we owe the first attempt at a guide-book of the
Abbey	LOCATION	, -- a list , in
Latin	LOCATION	, of the chief monuments , with their inscriptions .

		It was published in
1600	DATE	.

		Since then , writing books about
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	has been an occupation especially attractive to those who have lived within the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	's precincts ; and we have some deeply in - The Abbey Slue-book .

		The '' Annals '' and the ' • Deanerj Gaide '' were written by
Miss E. T. Brad	PERSON	- ley , who is the danghter of Dean
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's gneeewor .

		The last-named book was first published in
1885	DATE	, and its Talne to the risitor to tiie great
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	is attested by the fact that it has passed throagh twelve editions .

		Its writer -LRB- who has since become Mrs.

Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's • • Memorials '' or her own `` Annals , '' yet more comprehensive than the ''
Deanery Guide	ORGANIZATION	, '' has provided such a book in `` The RoU-CaU of Westminster Abbey '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is an attempt to furnish some bistorieal knowledge of the dead who are buried or commemorated in the
Abbey	LOCATION	; and while such an idea may not seem to promise Tery favorable results , Mrs.
Murray Smith	PERSON	has saeeeeded in making a very readable book , -- full of interest to one who is fond of antiquarian lore .

		It is .

		in fact , a guide-book relieved of its systematie dnlnesB .

		Elaborate ground-plans at the end of the book add to its value as a guide , and the half-tone fnll-ptage illustrations , twenty-five in number , being from photographs recently taken , gfive more accur - ate ideas of the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	interior than those with which we are more familiar .

		The colors of the binding correspond with the blue-and-gold hangings with which the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	was draped at the Coron '' - tion of
Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		The way of the translator of Aris - totle is sufficiently hard to make it a matter of special congratulation when a competent scholar turns his attention to this field .

		Professor TV .


A. Hammond	PERSON	, who holds the chair of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy at Cor - nell , has the training both of the philosopher and of the classical scholar , and the translation of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's Psychology which represents the first fruits of his labors is likely to remain a standard for some time to come -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It includes the '' De Anima '' and the ** Parva Naturalia . ''

		Of the latter there has hitherto been no satisfactory translation ; and while
Wallace	PERSON	's translation of the '' De Anima '' is in many respects excellent , the success of this new attempt jastifies it , apart from the desirability of having all of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's psychological writings in a single vol - ame .

		A valuable introduction sums up
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's psychological doctrines with a clearness and suc - cinctness which leaves little to be desired .

		The final section , on
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's conception of the crea - tive reason , is particularly successful in dispelling the haie which has gathered about that disputed question .

		Professor
Hammond	PERSON	is notably objective in his whole treatment , and avoids the tendency , Tery noticeable in
Wallace	LOCATION	among others , to read Aristotle too much in the light of modern , and especially Hegelian , philosophy .

		The translation itself is easy and straightforward , and almost al - ways clear where the text will allow of clearness .

		Expositions of the more difficult passages are given jr `` w in foot-notes .

		These are found just where they are needed ; and in general the author evidently has th '' notion that notes are intended for the reader 's enlightenment , rather than as a display of erudition .

		They are unusually free from useless lumber .

		While Aristotle can not b `` recommended for light reading , the book ought to meet with a welcome beyond th '' ranks of the specialist .

		The Psychology is less well known than it should be , especially in these days when everyone is supposed to have some interest in the subject which it treats .

		The modem quality of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's mind appears not least in his Psy - chology ; and one who approaches it simply out of cariosity , or for its historical value , is likely to find that he still has something to learn from a compar - ison with modern psychological results of this ear - liest attempt to svstematiz.e the facts of the mental life .

		On the twenty-third of Jan - nary ,

		The commemorative address , delivered by his successor in the bishopric , Dr.
Lawrence	PERSON	, is now published under the title ^ ''
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, a Study '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The sub - ject is , of coarse , too vast for the limits of a short oration ; but the speaker makes happy choice of a few leading characteristics of the great preacher .

		Three of his contributions to the religious thoaght of the day are dwelt upon .

		First , he taught the essential unity of the ani verse , -- God , man , aad na - ture , inextricably intervoven into a living organism working out God 's purpose .

		Secondly , he had con - fidence in God as the God of truth , and apprehended no conflict between science and religion .

		Thirdly , he preached the naturalness and healthiness of tbe religious life , and the divine sonsbip of man .

		The author is -LSB- perhaps a little over-emphatic in making Dr.
Brooks	PERSON	the great incolcator and expounder of the divinity that is in humanity , forgetting that this was Channing 's constant theme .

		Appropriate em - phasis is placed upon
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	's entire free - dom from narrowness , and his consequent influence far beyond the limits of his sect .

		His printed works have obtained a wider circulation than one might Bapp > ose .

		written by his son .

		Prof.
W. D. Mackenzie	PERSON	, of

April 16	DATE	, for the welfare of
South Africa	LOCATION	and her people .

		At first in charge of a local station , he soon came to see what an important bearing the politics of the country had upon mission work , and did not hesi - tate to take a hand in public affairs .

		South African politics is nothing if not strenuous , and he plunged into it with characteristic earnestness .

		He was an ardent Imperialist , and believed the British govern - ment should drop its vacillating policy and assume control of affairs with a firm hand .

		Naturally the attention of the authorities was drawn to him , and in course of time he was appointed Deputy Com - missioner for
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Here was the oppor - tunity to put in practice his theories of political reform , and he made a brave attempt to do it .

		He at once , however , encountered fierce opposition .

		The success of his plans would mean the failure of those of the land-grabbers and schemers of all kinds .

		It was a battle-royal between honesty and right - eousness on the one band , and greed and selfishness on the other .

		The latter won , temporarily at least , and
Mackenzie	PERSON	went back to his mission work .

		Quatrains from

F. York Powell	ORGANIZATION	.

		These verses were first printed in '' The Pageant '' six years ago , and are now given a more permanent form because '' they have been im - pudently misprinted by a pirate in the
United States	LOCATION	, where the laws as yet permit such dishonest and un - civil dealings . ''

		The last of these booklets , entitled `` All 's Well , '' is a selection of `` optimistic thoughts from the writings of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, '' made by Mr.
Graham	PERSON	Hope . ''

		Macbeth '' was the second volume in the ''
Vari	PERSON	- orum '' Shakespeare of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, and was published thirty years ago .

		It is now issued by the Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	in a revised edition which has been mainly prepared by the son of the veteran editor , Mr.
H. H. Furness	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Concerning which apostolic succession , we may quote the words of the elder editor : `` Surely , the instances are not many where a literary task begun by a father is taken up and carried forward by a son ; still fewer are they where a father can retire within the shadow with such conviction , as is now mine , that the younger hands are the better hands , and that the work will be done more deftly in the future than in the past .

		The book is really ab - sorbing in its interest .

		The story is told with a swing and a sweep most exhilarating . ''

		THE DIAL 287 9 Two Significant Books Reflections OF A Lonely Man By `` A. CM . ''

		A DELIGHTFUL little book of fireside philosophy that is so attractively written , and in such close touch with everyday mat - ters , that it will appeal to men and women alike .

		Given a man of clear alert mind ; put him before an open fire in a com - fortable chair , and he is likely to offer some ideas and theories worth listening to .

		To dis - course amid such surroundings has been a favorite tendency of several philosophers .

		`` It is well to think one 's own thoughts occasionally , even though they be wrong , '' the Lonely Man says , and the average reader will find these reflections so hu - man , so pertinent , and in such close touch with every-day life , that he will add that it is equally worth while to write them out for the benefit of others .

		It is often difficult to fix the genre of a mas - ter of the human spirit who uses words as his tools of work .


Edmund Burke	PERSON	, comparing him - self with his friends of the
Literary Club	ORGANIZATION	, mod - estly disclaimed the title of '' man of letters . ''

		And in the main he was right .

		All his vast knowledge , and world-sweeping thought , and processional train of rich-apparelled words , were set to the service of politics , -- given up to expounding the art of governing mankind .

		The ethical writer is as sadly to seek in pure literature as the political one .

		Literature of itself is disinterested .

		It has no axe to grind .

		It proposes no material , or even spiritual , end .

		It is simply a report of the universe and man - kind as they are .

		or a vision of them as they are dreamed to be .

		It is a second creation , hardly less real than the first .

		Compared witl ^ the poet and philosopher , the ethical and di - dactic writer is as a sign-post which gives the direction , to the landscape about it .

		It may be a more important thing to rule or reform men than to reproduce them in art , -- to give birth , that is , not to beings , of brief date , but to images of immortality .

		But it is certainly a different thing ; and when the writer on conduct or affairs seeks to take his place in literature , he must be content to rank as second - rate .

		In the muster-rolls of Greek and Latin literature , what place has
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	or
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	?

		The great discs of Homer and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	and
Lucretius	PERSON	, occult their tiny lamps or dim them in a day of glory .

		In the end , a writer of books must be judged by the canons of literature .

		This is becoming true even of the great religious documents of the world -- its Bibles .

		How much more must it be the case with books which make no claim to be inspired I It is an honorable feature in human charac - ter that it craves to be led and guided toward the right .

		The didactic writer always has his work cut out for him , and is assured of -LCB- -RRB- ower and influence .

		But prophet succeeds prophet ; and , once past , oblivion yawns for most of them .

		For one thing , axioms , as
Keats	PERSON	said , are not axioms until they have been proved upon our 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, pulses .

		They have a way of turning out half - truths , or no truths at all , as circumstances alter .

		They are mutually contradictory .

		If all the maxims and proverbial sayings of the world were brought together , they would destroy each other like a roomful of
Kilkenny	LOCATION	cats .

		Human nature is too profound and mysterious to be bound up in a code of short sayings .

		The great philosophies and poems of the world exist on an entirely different plane .

		The first may be unprovable , and the second untrue : the first may merely illuminate the walls of our prison - house , and the second may deal with impossible creations , -- gods , and demons , and superhu - man men .

		But what matters that ?

		They are great imaginations , to which we must return again and again for exaltation and refreshment .

		Side by side with the world of reality exists this phantom world ; and the man who succeeds in extending it , or adding to its population , takes , humanly speaking , the highest place .

		Lit - erature teaches also -- but it teaches not by the cold , inert method of precept , but by the vivid and vital force of example .

		Achilles moulded all antiquity to his own image and Hamlet has cast his shadow on the whole of modern life .

		Critics are often accused of ingratitude in dealing with great men .

		If these bring us good gifts , it is said , let us humbly accept them , and not stop to investigate their value or cost .

		But always with criticism there are present the questions of precedence and perma - nence .

		Who is entitled to the crown ?

		and which wreath is of unfading amaranth ?

		In the case of
Emerson	LOCATION	, there is much to confuse American criticism .

		Respect for his lofty character , local loyalty , gratitude for guidance in a great National crisis , -- all these things make him loom large in our eyes .

		He did many things , but essentially he is a teacher -- a preacher .

		His works are the sublimed es - sence of a myriad of
New England	LOCATION	sermons .

		He was a maker of moral maxims ; a teacher of conduct .

		In some moods , he said , the verse of Shakespeare would sound like the tinkling of tin pans .

		He said also that his own effort was always to discard the wrappings of things and to get at their innermost secret .

		He pre - ferred to put his hand on the seed of the tree , rather than to enjoy its full growth and efflor - escence .

		In this , his instinct was the opposite of the true poet , who desires to multiply phe - nomena and to envisage the whole mass of life .

		His effort was always the effort of the maxim-maker to condense all experience into a phrase .

		There are two traditional incidents in the history of philosophy , which come to mind in thinking of
Emerson	LOCATION	: one , the meeting of the young Socrates with Parmenides ; the other , the interview between the equally youthful Confucius and the ancient master of mystery and mysticism Lao Tsze .

		In both cases the re - sult was apparently the same .

		The old men listened with an ironic smile to the clear , con - fident , everyday wisdom of the new teachers of conduct and morals .

		Something like this may well have happened at the first meeting of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Emerson is our village
Socrates	LOCATION	.

		He has a wise word for all men 's daily needs .

		He admonishes and helps .

		But compared with the cloudy , lightning-fulgent
Carlyle	PERSON	, he is trivial and shallow and prosaic .

		Emerson 's essays are full of allusions to philosophy .

		Plato and
Zoroaster	PERSON	and the
Rig Veda	LOCATION	do business at the old stand on almost every other page .

		Yet one doubts whether he was really capable of forming a metaphysical concept .

		He could never concentrate his thoughts long enough on one subject to do so .

		He scorns logic and cohesion .

		His sentences are a heap of glittering particles that run through one 's fingers .

		Hence his baffling quality .

		There is no founding anything on him .

		He is a veritable quicksand of an author .

		Nearly every great thinker has some central thought fixed firm against all shifting tides and winds .

		The central thought of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	is the theory of Ideas , -- the assertion of the apparition al character of the seemingly real world .

		The central thought of
Pascal	PERSON	is that of Human Intelligence confronting the Uni - verse and strangled by it like
Laoeoon	PERSON	in the inexorable coils of the snake .

		The central thought of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	is the absurdity of life .

		We know where to have these writers , -- but
Emerson	LOCATION	we never know .

		He chops and changes with every book he has been reading , or with every reader he desires to mould .

		Like Polonius , he is willing to agree that the cloud may be a camel , or a whale , or a weasel .

		And he is never thorough , in
Strafford	LOCATION	's sense of the word .

		He writes you about the scholar or the poet , -- and the strain rises like a stream of rich distilled perfume ; but then it occurs to him that the butcher , the baker , and the can - dlestick-maker are also vertebrate animals , and have a certain reason for being , and he gives you their Apotheosis .

		What he was after , all
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 296 bis life , was practicable idealism .

		But prac - ticable idealism is a contradiction in terms , and sacrifices both the ideal and the practical .

		It seems like flying in the face of
Providence	LOCATION	, to repine at onr luck in having a writer who is filled with a sense of the brightness of things , -- who believes only in the best in human na - ture .

		But there is a lack of reality in the op - timistic view .

		Emerson reminds one of the artist who was commissioned to paint a picture of the crossing of the Red Sea .

		When he ex - hibited his canvas it was merely one expanse of red paint . ''

		Why , '' said his patron , '' where are the Israelites and Egyptians ? '' ''

		Oh , '' answered the artist , '' the Israelites have crossed over , and the Egyptians are all drowned . ''

		In
Emerson	LOCATION	's books , human nature has passed on , or is hidden in a field of tenuous light .

		Three , at least , of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's English con - temporaries must dispute with him the primacy in spiritual and ethical thought .

		They are
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	,
Newman	PERSON	, and
Huskin	PERSON	.

		Carlyle is out of all measure the largest of the group .

		He was half artist , half moralist .

		If in his capacity of moralist his heart was full of angry dis - dain of the pernicious race of mortals ' * mostly fools , '' as an artist he could take delight in their weakness and waywardness .

		He had the artist 's love of deep shadows ; and the darkness of the gloomy masses of mankind was all the more welcome to him in that it served to set off the splendor of the few great heroic figures whom he wholly loved .

		Emerson was
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's pupil .

		He reproduced him , but he reproduced him as a photographic negative does -- revers - ing all the lights and shades .

		Like a good witch , he reads the spell backwards : and a lovely fairy appears where before was an hideous hob - goblin .

		He turns all
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's roughness to favor and to prettiness , and out of his welter - ing chaos made a really charming world where nice people can walk up and down .

		But when one of Homer 's heroes , hard pressed , calls for superhuman aid , the god comes to him in a cloud , -- and with the cloud withdraws the god .

		Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	, bottomed on faith and authority , is a sure refuge to many who tire of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's stormy frowns , and who find no strength in
Emerson	LOCATION	's smiling cheerfulness .

		Like Carlyle he is melancholy ; but his mel - ancholy is full of beauty , -- '' Elysian beauty , melancboly grace , Brought from a pensive tho ' a happy place . ''

		Even
Newman	PERSON	's style is midway between the two .

		If he has no sentences with the arrowy keenness of
Emerson	LOCATION	, and no passages with the sunset splendor of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	, he has pages and chapters of more perfect and even excellence than either , and when all were fighting over questions of ethics and morals , his message to mankind , -- that it should believe in a Church in which so many and such mighty minds have believed , -- has immense practical utility .


Ruskin	PERSON	is the least original of this group of latter-day prophets .

		But his pictured style out - glows any prose the others have wrought ; and the ardor with which be championed every spiritual cause , the earnestness with which he descended into every arena , the self-sacrifice which drove him into the back-alleys of the world , -- these make him the most missionary spirit of them all .

		There remains for me to say something of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		As in
Arnold	LOCATION	's case , the Muse can defend her son .

		In the last analysis , when we have driven off the thin vapors of his eclectic borrowings and withdrawn the fluid gold of his prose maxims , there is left a res - iduum of indestructible crystals of verse .

		They are the tiniest and most fragmentary crystals ever produced by a considerable poet ; but they flash with the white light of the diamond .

		Im - agination failed him , the plastic gift failed him , in pieces of any length ; but there are a score or two of phrases , lines , quatrains , fragments , which have a verbal felicity hardly equaled elsewhere in American poetry . ''

		Oh , tenderly the haughty day FiUs its blue urn with fire , '' -- That is style , new , nniqae , and as good as the best .

		Emerson , on the whole , seems to me an odd combination of the natures of St.
Francis	PERSON	and
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, -- which type appears somehow suited to our American ideals .

		His spirituality is a corrective to our materialism , and his canniness a compliment to it .

		But he can never be satisfactory to the imaginative or the logical mind .

		He has not the energy , or the richness , or the profundity , to appeal to those who have fed upon the great poets and philosophers .

		He was a purveyor of first-lessons in philosophy , and of proverbial rules of life for intellectual children .

		He may keep an audience of these to the end ; or they may seek other masters .

		But great men will pass him by with but a slight salute .

		296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, THE MORALITY PLAY IN THE BE VEL - OPMENT OF ENGLISH DRAMA .

		In very many senses , this time in which we are living is a period of looking backward .

		All through the
latter half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, interest hag been increasing in the things of long ago .

		Aa the people of the fifteenth century found Antiquity , 80 we moderns have been discovering the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		Our passion for the Gothic , our interest in handicraft , our love of folk-song , our admiration for Pre-Raphaelite art , all attest this revival .

		No won - der , then , that the presentation of the fifteenth century play '' Everyman '' has aroused , first in
London	LOCATION	, then in
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, the greatest enthusiasm . ''

		Everyman '' belongs to that class of pseudo dramas , called Moralities , that developed when the popular religious plays , known as Mysteries or Mir - acles , were approaching their decadence .

		Imported from French monasteries by the Normans who came into
England	LOCATION	with the Conquest , they soon took firm hold upon English life .

		At first they were a part of the liturgical ceremony of the church .

		On great feast days , and especially at Christmas and Easter , a simple dramatic representation was introduced into the service , priests and choristers taking the parts .

		Gradually these strictly liturgical Mysteries gave place to more elaborate productions , which were detached from the office , though still per - formed in the churches ; the vernacular was sub - stituted for Latin ; whole series of Mysteries were joined together into a single work .

		Then , needing of course more room for presentation , they were taken outside of the churches to the steps and grave - yards , and finally away from them altogether .

		During this process of secularization , the laity , serving first for chorus , -- as for instance , the rab - ble before the court of
Pontius Pilate	ORGANIZATION	, -- had come to take the principal roles , and at last to produce the entire play .

		While in
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's lifetime both clergy and laity were actors , it was not long after his death -LRB- 1400 -RRB- that the participation of the clergy was forbidden .

		Through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , the Miracles were performed chiefly by the Gilds of the towns at their out-of-door
Corpus Christi	ORGANIZATION	festivals .

		In the hands of the Gilds they developed into great cycles of plays , of which those of York , Townly ,
Chester	PERSON	, and
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	are the most famous .

		These cycles told the Scripture story from the Creation to the Day of Judgment , and re - quired usually three days for their presentation .

		To each Gild was entrusted permanently the perform - ance of one part of the series , -- for instance , to the shipbuilders the episode of
Noah	PERSON	and the Ark , to the goldsmiths the Adoration of the
Three Kings	ORGANIZATION	, to the smiths the Crucifixion ; and of course the societies vied with each other in the splendor of the production .

		Movable platforms called pageants , upon each of which one act in the drama was pre - sented , were dragged from point to point about the town and showed in their proper order to the spec - tators .

		Heaven ,
Earth	LOCATION	, and Hell were set forth on three different elevations of the stage , with naive simplicity , but , in the case of Hell especially , with awful realism .

		The grotesquely-clad imps and devils who ran in and out of Hell 's mouth , and teased the other actors and the spectators , repre - sented a comedy element ; and humorous episodes having to do with the lesser Scriptural characters , such as
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	's wife and the torturers of Jesus , further relieved the strain of the more intense parts of the drama .

		In some such form as this the miracles continued to be played till the early part of the seventeenth century .

		Alongside them for more than a century existed plays which , instead of telling simply the Biblical story in dramatic form , aimed to enforce a moral truth directly by means of personified ab - stractions of the virtues and vices .

		These dramas were called Moralities .

		Such dramatis personw as Envy , Charity , Good Deeds ,
Intemperance	ORGANIZATION	, woven into an imaginary tale or popular legend , made up the Morality .

		Though traces of personification of abstract ideas are found in some of the old Mir - acles , and two plays not now extant , written in the fourteenth century , were supposed to be of the na - ture of Moralities , there is no positive evidence of a Morality proper before the fifteenth century .

		Probably they grew out of the Miracles , and sup - plemented them .

		Certainly they followed the older drama closely in manner and method of presenta - tion , using the same pageants , the same three ele - vations of the stage , the same style of costuming , and the same comedy effects .

		Something in the English mind and disposition seems particularly favorable to Allegory ; hence the Moralities flourished with the greatest luxuriance on English soil .

		A large number of them are still extant , of which '' The
Castell	PERSON	of Perseverance , '' composed in Henry the Sixth 's time , is the earliest , and '' Everyman , '' thought to have been written by a Dutch priest in the
latter half of the fifteenth century	DATE	, is '' the flower and crown . ''

		Unlike the Miracle plays , the Moralities were in touch with the age that produced them .

		Thinkers found in them a splendid opportunity for direct treatment of moral , social , and political problems .

		It was in the Reformation age under the Tudors that the Mor - ality attained its greatest influence and popularity . ''

		Nature '' and '' The World and the Child '' are early Tudor plays . ''

		The Lusty Juventus , '' written in Edward the Sixth 's time , shows the influence of the Reformation , while '' The Interlude of Youth '' indicates the Catholic reaction under
Mary	PERSON	.

		Two non-religious Moralities , '' The Nature of the Four Elements '' and '' Wyt and Science , '' written in praise of learning , point to the emergence of the renaissance spirit .

		Although the Morality was in the main abstract in character , dealing with pure personifications , it was not without concrete and comic elements , which , as they developed , brought it to the very threshold
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 of comedy .

		The chief of these was the Vice , after - wards transformed into the Jester or Fool of ElizA - bethan plays .

		The Vice , originally an attendant of the Devil , gradaally became an independent char - acter upon whom the aathor exercised his originality and wit .

		It is the fan and mad pranks of the Vice that sagared the pill of the moral lesson to the au - dience and saved many of these allegories from hopeless dalness .

		The authors of Moralities gave a coloring of reality also by allnding to the actual world aroand the audience , placing the action in the streets and places they knew .

		Sometimes , too , in place of abstract appellations , sach as Idleness ,
Folly	ORGANIZATION	,
Enmity	LOCATION	, specific names were given to the characters , who thas became more human .

		In '' Like wil to Like quod the Devel to the
Colier	ORGANIZATION	, '' -- a Morality full of boisterous fun and of moral - izings upon the pernicious results of riotous living , -- the persons are called
Nichol Newfangle	ORGANIZATION	,
Ralph Roister	PERSON	.


Tom Tosspot	PERSON	, and
Hankin Hangman	PERSON	.

		If not individuals , at least social types were evolved .

		While the Morality through the sixteenth century was developing in the direction of concreteness and humor , another dramatic form destined to influence its future , was taking shape beside it .

		Since Plan - tagenet times , kings had employed troops of pro- fessional actors , or mimes , who composed for the en - tertainment of the court various sorts of mummeries and humorous dramatized anecdotes or farces .

		These one-act plays were called Interludes , from the fact that they were played in the intervals be - tween courses at public banquets .

		Now it remained for some genius to combine these airy nothings with the more highly-developed and serious moralities .

		To
John Heywood	PERSON	, one of the • ' singers '' in the household of
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	, belongs the credit of having accomplished this .

		It is to plays of the type of his , -- a cross between the early Interlude and the Morality proper .

		-- that the name Interlude is usually applied in the history of literature .

		His little skits .

		-- `` The Mery Play between the Par - doner and the Frere , '' ' • The Four P 's .

		or Mery Interlude between the
Palmer	PERSON	, the Pardoner , the Potycary .

		and the Pedlar , ' '' The Dialogue of Wit and Folly . ''

		and the rest , -- are full of freshness , of vigor , and of animation .

		They show an undeniable sense of humor , and , above aJl , power of drawing successfully individual characters taken from actu ^ life .

		They are more than mere entertainments , for with the liveliest wit they attack the abuses of the time .

		Though
Heywood	PERSON	can not be called the creator of English comedy , the type of play he developed exhibited many of its essential qualities .

		In the form of Interlude , the Morality survived into the seventeenth century , and became ' `` one of the threads which went to make up the wondrous web of the Elizabethan drama . ''

		It would seem an easy step from Interlude to Comedy proper ; yet another element must needs be added before this still form - less dramatic species could be converted into legit - imate drama .

		This was supplied by the study of Plantns and
Terence	PERSON	, and of the Italian dramatists whom the Renaissance , coming tardily into En - gland , had introduced to the scholars .

		Then at last the seed which had been planted in good ground burst into flower and brought forth the Shakes - pearian harvest

		THE ' • EVERLASTING PYRAMIDS . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		Moch has been written about the Pyramids of Gizeh ; abundance of description , statistics , and of the wonder and admiration excited by them .

		But during a recent visit , I came to a thought abaut them that had not been in my mind before .

		I think I shall never again use the eomparison , '' As everlasting as the Pyramids . ''

		The piles of debris on every side of the Great Pyramid , called '' of
Cheops	LOCATION	, '' suggested the question , '' Whence came those heaps ? ''

		There they rested against the huge slopes , forty or fifty feet higher than the general level on which we walked or rode around ; and that level is above the original foundation as discovered and settled by
Vyse	PERSON	and others .

		Evidently the answer to the question is , '' From the pyramid itself . ''

		It is made of a friable limestone , and is perpetually losing some substance .

		Numerous blocks lie around that have fallen because the stones under them have been so soft as to give way under pressure and weathering , and to allow the superincumbent one t `` roll down .

		I did not try climbing the pyramid ; but a field-glass detected easily many of these rotting stones .

		At the southeast comer I stepped up to a stone to measure it ; I saw that the one under it was so soft that I could easily with my cane have detached from it four or five pounds of the rock .

		I did not do it : a light touch showed what could be done .

		There aie at
Sakkara	LOCATION	and elsewhere piles of debris that once were pyramids .

		I do not advise any one to hurry to
Egypt	LOCATION	to see the pvramid before it goes to pieces ; there is enough to last many thousand years more : I do but record the feeling of ruin of the monument in aeeordanee with all else in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		I found it easy to step upon the back of the Sphinx ; bat as I walked toward the bead I came upon a transrene fissore three feet wide and equally deep , extending down the sides , I did not see how far .

		In the neck of the image I noticed that some strata are softer than others , and ate more rapidly cat away by the wind-hurled sands .

		The same aspect of progressive ruin struck me in the grand
Hall of Columns	ORGANIZATION	at
Karnak	LOCATION	.

		I learn that eleven columns of that vast eolonnade fell at once in
1899	DATE	.

		To me it looked as if those gigantic blocks ought to stand forever .

		He must be more of a physicist than I am who can explain their fall .

		The grand hall met all my ex - pectations of its magnitude and solemn , wondrous grandeur ; yet when I had gone through the great temple of Earnak and seen how much of it lay pros - trate in inextricable confusion amid piles of debris , so that no skill of fitting can reconstruct wall , pylon , obelisk , and column , the feeling of ruin , ruin , over - powered my recollection of the real grandeur and beauty of what I had seen ; greater than the brute magnitude of piled blocks in the pyramids , for here was a grander conception , more of intellect and taste ; beauty as well as size .

		* Headers of Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's anecdotal biog - raphies of
Edward A. Sothern	PERSON	,
John Hare	PERSON	, and the Kendals , will not be disappointed in their expectation of entertainment when they open his latest work .

		His association with
Bret Harte	PERSON	in play-writing , and the long and inti - mate friendship of the two , render him a fit person to pay this tribute to the deceased story - writer .

		For the part of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's life that was spent in
England	LOCATION	perhaps no better choice of a biographer could have been made ; but the preceding forty years of American life are less fuliy and satisfactorily treated .

		To this portion of
Harte	PERSON	's eventful career better justice could have been done by one of his old Cali - fornia friends , -- Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	, for in - stance , or Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	, or Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	.

		Indeed , the last-named writer has left on record some pleasing rem - iniscences of his departed friend , -- to whom he avowed himself indebted for all that he had become and all that he had accomplished , -- and from these reminiscences Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	quotes at some length .

		He gives these extracts as having been personally communicated to him for the purpose of his book ; but , except - ing a few lines , they are to be found , word for word , in Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's recently-published '' Exits and Entrances . ''

		We can readily be - lieve , however , that Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	had the first right to use this material , and that its publication by Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	was an after - thought .

		Like many another English writer before him , Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	betrays an imperfect knowledge of American history .

		He even goes out of his way to make a small contribution to the sum of human ignorance ; for after giving the place and date -LRB-
Albany	LOCATION	,
1839	DATE	-RRB- of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's birth , he is not content to let well enough alone , but adds that this city '' was founded by the Dutch in
1623	DATE	, and was thus the oldest European settlement in the
United States	LOCATION	, with the exception of
Jamestown	LOCATION	in
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' -- both of which assertions are er - roneous .

		By the side of this may be put a careless blunder iu American geography .

		Speaking of

		The offers he now received to take his stand - ing in
Western America	LOCATION	became too tempting to be refused . ''

		A few little-known but significant facts and anecdotes about
Bret Harte	PERSON	's life and writings are worthy of note here .

		The extent of his literary product has probably inclined most people to think of him as a rapid if not a care - less writer .

		He has often been accused of harping on the same string to the point of weariness , and of infusing no new life into his later works .

		A study of his biography shows him to have been as painstaking , as reluctant to go to press , and -LRB- if we are to credit Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	-RRB- as unhackneyed , at the end as in the beginning .

		He knew how to take infinite pains , and was his own severest critic .

		We are told that he never knew the humiliation of having a contribution rejected ; but the story that first made him known to the world had a narrow escape . ''

		The Luck of Roaring Camp '' came near being returned by himself as editor of the `` Overland Monthly '' to himself as a contributor to its columns .

		Publisher , printer , and proof-reader were united in their unfavor - able criticism of the morality and general tone of the sketch , the alarm first starting with the girl who read the proof and who was scandal - ized when she encountered a big , big D .

		But after consulting with friends , the author made the publication of the tale the condition of his retaining the editorship of the magazine .

		The rest is well known .

		Mr.
Fields	PERSON	asked him for similar contributions for the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' and the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	press was unanimous in his praise .

		Some of his most strikingly original and touching narratives , in both prose and verse , -- little tales that brought tears to the reader 's eyes , but were held to be impossible of actual oc - currence , -- received subsequent confirmation of a remarkable sort . ''

Tom Flynn	PERSON	's heroism in forcing his '' pardner '' to flee before him from a collaps - ing mine . ''

		Run for your life ,
Jake	PERSON	I Run for your wife 's sake !

		Do n't wait for me . ''

		Years afterward the newspapers reported an almost identical instance of self-sacrifice in the case of two men engaged in cleaning the in - side of an eight-foot upright boiler .

		Suddenly a workman outside turned on the steam , know - ing that the cock was closed and assuming that it was tight .

		But it leaked badly , scalding steam poured in upon the two men , and they rushed
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 to the ladder to make their escape through the manhole at the top .

		The one who reached it first took one step , then stopped , drew back , and shouted , '' You go first ,
Jim	PERSON	; you are married ! ''

		Like
Flynn	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, this humble hero paid for his generosity with his life .


Bret Harte	PERSON	's love for his friends was beauti - ful , and it was heartily returned .

		For
James Anthony Froude	PERSON	he cherished the warmest ad - miration and affection .

		Perhaps the fact that both were romancers , the one professedly , the other under the guise of historian , made them 80 peculiarly congenial .

		As we have lately taken occasion to present the historian in not exactly the most flattering light , perhaps it will be well to try to balance the account by quot - ing
Bret Harte	PERSON	's opinion of him .

		He writes to his wife : '' But
Froude	PERSON	-- dear old noble fellow -- is splendid .

		I love him more than I ever did in
America	LOCATION	.

		He is great , broad , manly -- Democratic in the best sense of the word , scorning all sycophancy and meanness , ac - cepting all that is around him , yet more proud of his lit - erary profession than of his kinship with these people whom he quietly controls .

		There are only a few liter - ary men like him here , but they are kings .

		I could not have had a better introduction to them than through
Froude	PERSON	, who knows them all , who is
Tennyson	PERSON	's best friend , and who is anxious to make my entree among them a success . ''

		The biographer takes pains to assure the reader again and again that
Bret Harte	PERSON	's genius was not so narrowly circumscribed as is com - monly believed , that he could and did write on other themes than those Californian .

		Yet the appended Bibliography , which fills nine page ?

		and seems to have been carefully prepared , makes a very small showing of any other than
California	LOCATION	stories and poems .

		As the inimi - table painter of these far-western scenes he will always be remembered , and that is glory enough .

		Of the consulate at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, which was pre - ceded by a briefer one at
Cref	ORGANIZATION	eld on the
Rhine	LOCATION	, we read much that is interesting .

		That the
Glasgow	LOCATION	consul 's office was the one place where the erratic consul was sure not to be found , passed into a proverb .

		The attractions of Lon - don and
Paris	LOCATION	were too strong for him , al - though there is no reason to believe that the routine work of his office suffered by his ab - sence .

		With the outgoing of the Arthur ad - ministration the genial incumbent was set free from '' the desk 's dead wood , '' and thereafter he passed most of his time in
London	LOCATION	.

		His letters and not `` s to English friends are always bright and amusing .

		To Colonel Arthur Col - lins , one of his theatre-loving friends , he dashes off the following : '' Yes .

		While Mr.

Bret Harte	PERSON	's life nor a critical study of him as a writer , it is perhaps as satisfactory a memorial as could be expected so soon -LRB- less than a year -RRB- after the novelist 's untimely death , and will be hailed with satis - faction wherever the '' Heathen Chinee '' has become a familiar character , and by all who enjoy the chatty and anecdotal in biography .

		No thinking man any longer contemplates the possibility of an offhand settlement of the Negro problem .

		With a Negro population ap - proaching ten millions , and with the masses of both the white and the black race permeated by the prejudices growing out of slavery and the Civil War and enhanced by the blunders and crimes of the early years of emancipa - tion , the best that can reasonably be hoped for now is a slow and steady progress in the right direction , -- that is , in the direction of the highest possible freedom of opportunity for both white and black , unhampered by unfair legislation or administration , or by the no less galling methods of social oppression in walks of life where the law does not and should not enter .

Tuakegee Institute Steam Print	ORGANIZATION	.

		800 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, are scarcely more familiar than that of the
Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		The message which Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	feels it his duty to bear to his race is , ' ■ ' ■ Make yourselves in - dustrially necessary , each man and woman of you , to the community in which you live .

		Let the pursuit of art , literature , and politics wait , for the present , and train the mind di - rectly to the guidance of the skilled hand .

		When you shall have learned to raise two or three bushels of corn or potatoes , two or three bales of cotton , on the ground where but one grows to-day , when you begin to pay heavy freights into the coffers of the railroads which now force you into '
Jim Crow	PERSON	' cars , when you figure as stockholders in the enterprises which now discriminate against you , then you will be rated simply as men and women , and neither hated nor pitied on the ground of color . ''

		Around this idea the work of the Tuskegee In - stitute has been built up , with careful attention to moral training , of course , hand in hand with the industrial .

		The idea has gained an im - mense popularity .

		It has seemed to justify it - self by its results , and Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	has be - come , as Professor Du Bois well says , a leader both of the black race and the white .

		No doubt the feature in Professor
W. E. B. Du Bois	PERSON	's `` The Souls of Black Folk '' which will draw the most immediate attention is the fact that the writer takes determined and em - phatic issue with Mr.
Booker	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	's policy , and that too in its most salient point , -- the insistence upon the industrial , and the ele - mentary , in negro education .

		Professor
Du Bois	PERSON	is perhaps the most scholarly man of his race in
America	LOCATION	today , -- a man of high schol - arship and culture in that broader republic of human attainment which knows no limitation of race , color , or clime .

		In his acquaintance with the art and literature of various lands and ages he finds the best solace for the peculiar troubles entailed upon him and his by race prejudice in this land and age . ''

		I sit with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and he winces not .

		Across the color line I move arm in arm with
Balzac	LOCATION	and
Dumas	PERSON	, where smiling men and welcom - ing women glide in gilded halls .

		From out the caves of evening that swing between the strong - limbed earth and the tracery of the stars , I summon Aristotle and
Aurelius	PERSON	and what soul I will , and they come all graciously , with no scorn nor condescension .

		So , wed with Truth , I dwell above the Veil . ''

		One can readily see that such a spirit would scent the danger of low , materialistic ideals in the Tuskegee pro- gramme , so rigidly industrial .

		And we are not sure that there is not reason for his fear .

		To rely too solely upon worldly thrift is the great temptation of the age .

		It may be true , as Mr.
Washington	PERSON	says , that the Negro who will pay
$ 10,000	MONEY	a year in freights will not have to ride in a `` Jim Crow '' car ; but there are a great many white people who would rather ride in a `` Jim Crow '' with a
Burghardt Du Bois	ORGANIZATION	or a
Booker T. Washington	ORGANIZATION	on the other end of the seat than in a Pullman with either Negroes or white men whose consideration at the hands of the railway officials should grow only out of the amount paid to the road in freights .

		It is certainly possible to go too far in adjuring the Negroes to put away their ambition to enter the higher fields of literature and learning , and to forego their legitimate desire to avail themselves at will of the rights and privileges conferred upon them by the Constitution .

		Suppose that our colored millions should become industrious and prosperous , and fairly up with the average in personal morals , too , but entirely apathetic as to political rights and duties , and devoid of ambition toward the highest mental and spirit - ual development , -- the present Negro problem would then be practically solved , but would it be an acceptable solution to anyone with a con - sistent belief in freedom and equality as the best basis for progress and permanence in hu - man government and society ?

		Let no one assume , however , that Professor Du Bois and
Principal Washington	LOCATION	are hope - lessly at variance .

		The divergence , at most , bears only upon present methods .

		Their ulti - mate aim is one , -- the uplifting of their people physically and materially , mentally , morally , and spiritually .

		All that the latter can do to improve the material condition of their common people the former will gladly welcome . ''

		So far as Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	preaches Thrift ,
Pa	ORGANIZATION	- tience , and Industrial Training for the masses , we must hold up his hands and strive with him , rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength of this
Joshua	PERSON	, called of God and of man to lead the headless host . ''

		And we are very seriously mistaken in Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	if he would knowingly put any obstacle in the path of any one of his race who has the am - bition to climb to a place on the higher seats of mental culture by the side of Professor
Du Bois	PERSON	, at any rate when that ambition is coupled with evidence of sufficient mental ability to give a reasonable hope of results commensurate with the effort .

		Many of the white race are be - ginning to doubt whether we have not gone too
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 801 far in pressing into the higher studies a class of youths who might readily make skilful and useful followers of some industrial pursuit , but have not the mental makeup for successful assimilation of the higher learning .

		We have not the statistics at hand by which to test Pro- fessor Du
Bois	PERSON	's claim that Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	's work is drying up the fountains of support for the higher education of colored youths in other than industrial lines , but we feel quite confi - dent that such a result would be contrary to his desire .

		We are not sure that Mr.
Wash	PERSON	- ington realizes the possible value of this higher learning to the very industrial training in which he is so deeply interested , -- in fact but very few , white or colored , have realized it .

		It is true , however , that agriculture and the me - chanical pursuits offer a fair field for the very highest type of trained intellect which the more distinctively cultural studies , Greek , logic , phil - osophy , etc. , can produce .

		As the college grad - uate multiplies in the land , more and more will he be driven from sheer overcrowding else - where to devote his powers to these more fun - damental means of livelihood , and the Negro will need his own trained leaders here as else - where .

		On the other hand we are not sure that Professor
Du Bois	PERSON	, on more careful con - aideration , would feel himself justified in add - ing to the passage quoted above , the words : * ' But so far as Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	apologizes for injustice .

		North or South , does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting , belittles the emasculating effects of caste distinctions , and opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds , -- so far as he , the South , or the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, does this , -- we must unceas - ingly and firmly oppose them . ''

		Frank and full confidence between these two leaders of their race will surely enable them each warmly to aid the other in his chosen field , to the great advan - tage of their common aim .

		We have placed among the material for this notice a work of a type far different from the writings of Professor Du Bois and
Principal Washington	LOCATION	, -- `` The Leopard 's Spots , '' by Mr.
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Though Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's book is thrown into the form of a novel , so far as it can be said to possess form at all , its aim is to justify to
Northern	ORGANIZATION	readers the attitude of political and social suppression assumed to - ward the Negro by the dominant white senti - ment of the South .

		As to the writers method , he has chosen to set forth as vividly as possible the faults and crimes current among the Ne - groes of the South , culminating in an unflinch - ing relation of a fatal assault by a brutal Negro upon an innocent white girl , and an equally un - sparing description of the punishment swiftly visited upon the ravisher , -- burning at the stake .

		Plainly the design is that the reader shall exclaim in bis indignation , ^ ' I too would have helped to do the same , under the same circumstances ! ''

		And crude as the book is in most respects , it must be admitted that this portion of it is quite skilfully adapted to the end in view .

		And Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	selected his time well , too , -- the time when our unfortunate ex - periment in
the Philippines	LOCATION	has so generally deadened the public conscience toward any ap - peal to that finer regard for the rights of man simply as man , which was such an inspiration to the masses of the North in the initial years of our experiment with Negro freedom ; when the eloquent
Curtis	PERSON	could sway audiences at his will with the thought that now at length oar government had been placed squarely upon its only consistent basis , the right of every citizen to a full participation in the government under which he is obliged to live .

		Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	thought that he saw great reason for hope in the fact that white and black fought bravely together in the battles of the Spanish - American war .

		Professor Du Bois shows far truer in - sight into the tendencies resulting from that conflict when he speaks of '' the silently grow - ing assumption of this age that the probation of races is past , and that the backward races of today are of proven inefficiency and not worth the saving . ''

		But to go back to Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	, it is only the unthinking man that can draw from his baleful picture the final conclu - sion which the writer desires .

		The Southern courts themselves , as Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	would hardly have the hardihood to deny , can be depended upon absolutely to inflict the extreme penalty of the law upon any Negro identified as the perpetrator of such crime as he describes ; and the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	legislatures can as surely be depended upon to strengthen its laws for the suppression of such crime if in any case they are not sufficiently strong already .

		Under such circumstances no moral man in his right mind should allow his prejudices to lead him into the support , directly or indirectly , of lynching .

		We commend to Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	the Intelligent reasoning of Professor Du Bois and Mr.
Wash	PERSON	- ington on this subject .

		He has much to learn from either one of them .

		He will find , for instance , that the faults of their race which he has passionately asserted are by them dispas - sionately admitted , -- on the whole , a rather 802 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
May	DATE	U more effective mode of presentation , if the end of presentation be the eradication of the faults in question .

		Of course everybody reads more or less of Mr.
Booker	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	, either from his books or from the frequent addresses occasioned by the prominence of his educational veork .

		Pro- fessor
Du Bois	ORGANIZATION	is known to a less extensive cir - cle .

		We believe that a wide reading of the latter 's new book will do much to promote a correct understanding of the problems of Negro education and citizenship .

		In style , it must be pronounced somewhat uneven , -- al - ways readily intelligible , rising now and then to a genuine eloquence , sometimes perhaps a little more flowery or figurative than the occa - sion demands , rather crude in certain instances in dealing with the great mysteries of human life ; but all in all quite above the style of many who would be slow to admit that anything good in a literary way could come out of the African
Nazareth	LOCATION	.

		As to the tone of the book , we be - lieve that the author would do well to imbibe a little more of the hopeful spirit of
Principal Washington	LOCATION	.

		He is distinctly right in the opinion that the cause of the Negro has for the present suffered a serious backset in many im - portant particulars ; but he does not accept the pessimistic conclusion that this lost ground is irrecoverable .

		This being so , perhaps he might find good working capital in a little more of the cheerful attitude .

		And yet one who stops to consider the essential bitterness of beating against closed doors which ought to be open will not condemn too severely the heart that can not always show cheer under such circum - stances .

		And it may be , too , that the most of us need this demonstration that the Negro is actually capable of intense mental suffering under unjust treatment .

		The recognition of human brotherhood is not a strong point with us at present .

		Composed at different times and for different immediate purposes , the various chapters of Pro- fessor Du
Bois	PERSON	's volume do not present a formal unity , and yet they all bear in one way or an - other upon the thought suggested by the col - lective title , '' The Souls of Black Folk . ''

		On the historical side we find a very valuable sketch of the aims and failures , as well as the actual achievements , of the
Freedmen 's Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Else - where the author 's own experience as a country school teacher is related in an extremely inter - esting manner .

		Another chapter , essentially historical fact , to all appearances , though min - gled with a certain amount of entirely consis - tent fiction , tells of the tragic end of a Negro youth who went away to college and educated himself beyond the possibility of contentment with bis old environment -LRB- just as thousands of white boys are always doing , to the best inter - ests of themselves and all concerned -RRB- , and failed , upon returning , to accommodate him - self adequately to the powers of prejudice around him .

		But it is not our intention to give a detailed exposition of the book 's contents .

		Enough has been indicated to show that all who are , or ought to be , interested in the gen - eral subject should read it : to go further might tempt some such person into the belief that he had the drift of it sufficiently to excuse him from this duty .


W. H. Johnson	PERSON	.

		A Great German Publisher .

		* The personality alone of the author and the subject of the volumes under review would arouse extended interest in their contents .


Georg Joachim Goeschen I.	PERSON	, the subject , was the foremost German publisher of the last quar - ter of the eighteenth century -LRB- the great period of German literature -RRB- , the publisher of the complete works of Klopstock and
Wieland	PERSON	, of the first edition of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's collected works , and of most of
Schiller	PERSON	's prose works as well as ''
Don Carlos	PERSON	. ''


George Joachim III.	PERSON	, Vis - count
Goschen	PERSON	, the author , was the foremost financier of
England	LOCATION	during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	, author of '' The Theory of Foreign Exchange , '' a member of
Gladstone	PERSON	's first cabinet , Chancellor of the Ex - chequer in
Salisbury	LOCATION	's cabinet , and the mana - ger of the most important government financial operation of the century , -- the conversion of the public debt .


Viscount Goschen	PERSON	lives hale and hearty , devoting his well-earned leisure to authorship .

		From Goeschen to
Goschen	PERSON	, from German publisher to British Chancellor in two genera - tions , is a transformation that might of itself fascinate the student of history and ethnology .

		The facts , supported by the portraits which in - troduce the present volumes , show how near akin after all are continental
Saxon	PERSON	and insu - lar
Saxon	PERSON	, how few the touches needed to trans - • The Life and Times of
Georg Joachim Goschen	PERSON	, Publisher and Printer of

Viscount Goschen	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .

1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 305 form the amiable , smooth-faced , frill-bosomed German of Volume I. into the grave and kindly mutton-chopped British gentleman who intrep - idly faces the task of Volume II. , -- the task of writing , we would say , not that of reading , for this latter is far from a task .

		Still another interesting personal feature of the biography is the revelation of the character of the author , afforded by his attitude toward his subject .

		It is a delicate task to write the life of one 's grandfather .

		It is so difficult to avoid the standpoint of family pride , to keep the biography from becoming a mere '' trib - ute . ''

		And if one succeeds in this , he incurs the risk of seeming heartless and of being ac - cused of want of filial respect .

		Here
Viscount Gosehen	PERSON	's naturally judicial temperament has been happily supported by favoring circum - stances .

		Not only the two generations of life , but also the space of the
North Sea	LOCATION	and the transferred national allegiance , have served to give the distance necessary for objectivity . ''

		I may frankly say that I scarcely knew him till I be - gan my preparations for this book .

		I have made the publisher 's intimate acquaintance as I progressed with my task , reading countless letters to him and from him , and learning how be was judged by his contemporaries , but in large measure allowing him to gain my affection by what he wrote , did and suffered himself .

		It will be my fault and not his , if he fails to win my reader 's re - gard . ''

		Thus a son , who from wont and usage has perhaps taken his father as so much a matter of course as to have no warm feelings toward him , comes in later life , sometimes , to appre - ciate and love him almost as though he had never been related to him .

		It is the life of Goeschen the publisher that we have .

		The reader is not unpleasantly aware of the fact that it is the life of the grand - father of
Viscount Goschen	PERSON	.

		The author 's pur - pose to adopt '' a contemporary attitude toward the men with whom my grandfather was asso - ciated '' was supported by the possession of the old publisher 's books and correspondence , although a considerable number of letters from the most important period of his life were lost or stolen in the transfer of his business to the Cotta firm .

		It is to be desired that the Goeschen correspondence might be printed entire , or at least so far as the correspondents were figures in German history and literature .

		The essential value of this
Goeschen	PERSON	biog - raphy is to be found in the picture of the busi - ness and family life of Goeschen , a typical , or rather , perhaps , an ideal-typical German citi - zen of the period from
1775	DATE	to
1828	DATE	: in the in - sight given into the conditions of the book - trade for this period ; in the side-lights upon the character of the heroes of German litera - ture ; and , finally , in its contribution to the pic - ture of
Germany	LOCATION	during the Napoleonic wars .

		Left homeless at the age of thirteen , by en - ergy and integrity and devotion to a purpose
Goeschen	PERSON	became at thirty-four the publisher of
Schiller	PERSON	's ''
Don Carlos	PERSON	'' and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's col - lected works , and at forty probably the most sought and most successful publisher in Ger - many .

		His young manhood vras passed in that literary dawn in
Germany	LOCATION	when it was '' bliss to be alive , and to be young was very Heaven . ''

		He was intimate with
Schiller	PERSON	,
Koemer	PERSON	, and
Wieland	PERSON	, and with many lesser lights .

		While he developed a fairly shrewd and practical head , he was soulful all his life .

		His soul was filled with sentiment , and not merely with sen - timentality .

		His heart was in his profession .

		He wanted to make the best book possible in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He was proud of the high literary connections of his press , and jealous of this pride no less than of his business honor .

		Sen - sitiveness and pride , with some quick temper and stubbornness , sometimes disturbed his friendly relations with great writers , while they thwarted some of his most cherished businesa plans .

		He was a good citizen in the best sense of the term , a kind neighbor , a responsible em - ployer , a real patriot .

		In religion and poli - tics he was a man of the middle path ; not be - cause he compromised with his conscience , but because he was well balanced .

		`` Truth , justice , bencTolence .

		Such was the ideal of life , such the view of Christian teaching , which the publisher , whose years had been spent amidst violent revolutions of belief and in the storm-swept days of the Atifklaentng , retained up to the last , and preached to his fellow-men .

		The dignity of Christianity came home to him with special force , and he believed in ' the dignity , the holiness , the ennobling influence , the price - less blessing , of true prayer . ' ''

		The Aufklaerung was no spectre to Goeschen .

		He interpreted it as '' The voice of the founder of our religion , the voice of all nature , the voice of our own hearts , -- voices which no one can understand who is not aufgeklaert -LSB- illumined -RSB- .

		And what do these voices tell us ?

		They call to us , < Trust to the guidance of the Heavenly Father ; all the rest is gubtilty and fraud . ' ''

		Thus it will be seen that
Goeschen	PERSON	was some - thing of a preacher .

		Not only in such publica - tions as
Zacharias Becker	PERSON	's '' Help-in-Need '' and the various `` Frauen-Journale , '' but in his own ''
Johanns	PERSON	Reise '' -LRB- for
Goeschen	PERSON	took to authorship in a modest way -RRB- , and in the
Grimma Wochenblatt	LOCATION	, did Goeschen labor S04 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, steadily for the improvement of the manners and morals of his countrymen . ''

		And will the question be asked , ' Did Goeschen ` Strive in his own life to act up to the creed he pieached -- the creed in which benevolence , the same courtesy toward the poor as to the rich , the constant remem - brance of the oneness of human nature , were so con - spicuous ? '

		The record of his dealings with his neighbors , his life as a citizen , an employer , and a friend of the poor , prove that he cau stand the test . '' ''

		On the whole , he was a man belonging to the type of an earlier and almost expiring generation of German publishers , full of a firm honorableness , holding fast to good old traditions , in contrast to a rising generation , who were anxious to impart an entirely new form and spirit to the book-trade . ''

		When
Goeschen	PERSON	came upon the business stage the contest over the '' division of the spoils '' between authors and publishers had but just begun .

		Klopstock had put forth his ''
Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik	PERSON	, '' one feature of ■ which was to be cooperative publishing .

		The idealistic Germans were quick to put the plan into operation in the twin institutions , Die Buchhandlung der Gelehrten and Die Ver - lagscasse .

		The first was to manage the issue of books , the second to finance the individual authors .

		In the second of these institutions < jroeschen was employed , after a long appren - ticeship to the publishing business in the
Leipzig	LOCATION	house of Crusius .

		It is needless to say that the '' Authors ' Publishing Company '' did not last long .

		But
Goeschen	PERSON	acquired through this connection an invaluable acquaintance among the ambitious young writers of Ger - many .

		However , the vital contest was not between authors and publishers , but between the legit - imate publishers and their clients , on the one hand , and the '' pirate publishers , '' on the other .

		The rights of the author in his output were taken very lightly everywhere , which , with the minutely sub-divided condition of
Germany	LOCATION	politically , made life indeed a strug - gle for existence , with very few chances in favor of even the fittest author .

		When a book was about to be born , its god-father , the pub - lisher , was obliged to write or travel from court to court and beg the protection of this Grace or that Serene Highness for this or that particular territory , with no prospect in the world of securing a copyright good for all Ger - many .

		In addition to the uncertainty of ob - taining a copyright was the probability that the censor would prune the book or exclude it en - tirely .

		The letters and memoirs of Cotta and Perthes and
Goeschen	PERSON	are full of their variou campaigns and devices against piracy .

		But
Goeschen	PERSON	seems in his day to have been the most devoted and vehement warrior in the cause .

		His advertisements and denunciations and manifestoes are as entertaining as they are numerous .

		Self-piracy , as it may be called , was a curious practice which was sometimes resorted to by Goeschen as well as by others .

		Along with the various editions on fine paper and with royal margins bearing the imprint of the publisher , he would issue an edition from the same types but on the cheapest paper and without imprint .

		This he would put upon the market through a dealer at some other point , and , having the precedence in time , would hope thus to forestall a really pirated edition .

		This proceeding did not always meet the approval of the author , though it was clearly in his in - terest , and it has also added to the difficulties of the bibliographer .

		Among the subscribers to the complete edition of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's works , in the list prefixed to the fourth volume , appeared the following : '' A Pirate Publisher in -- '' This person , who is outside the pale , and whom the following Dedication -LSB- i. e. : Goethe 's introductory poem -RSB- does not concern , is warned by the publisher that he has taken carefully considered measures against him . ''

		Goethe , who had severe ideals of the dignity of authorship , requested that this '' drive '' be omitted from future editions .

		Again Goeschen would call direct attention to the offender , as in the following , from the '' Litter atur-Zeitung '' : `` Notice .

		--
C. G. Schmieder	PERSON	in
Karlsruhe	LOCATION	has com - mitted the unparalleled villainy of pirating six of my new publications all at once .

		I hereby publicly accuse this man of an unheard-of robbery , and warn every one who has the misfortune to have dealings with this fel - low , to beware of the rascal . ''

		Other and more effective methods of getting ahead of the pirates were serial publication and the issue of frequent revisions which sought to displace previous ones .

		Novels , dramas , and histories issued serially aroused the public ap - petite so that it hungered for the earliest pos - sible continuations of the subjects , and these could be had only from the legitimate pub - lisher .

		This accounts for the large number of journalistic ventures in the classical period of German literature .

		They were prompted more by the interests of the publisher than by the demands of the public .

		The '' Thalia , '' the '' Deutscher Mercur , '' the ''
Litteratur	PERSON	- und Voelkerkunde , '' the '' Frauen-Journal , '' the '' Deutsches Museum , '' were some of the jour - nals published by Goeschen .

		Goeschen was not only a patron of literature
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 `` id a friend of authors , but he was an enthu - siastic and artistic printer .

		It was bis constant ambition to equal in
Germany	LOCATION	the work of
Bodoni	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	and Didot in
France	LOCATION	.

		When he had succeeded in having fine and attractive type desianed and cast for his own work he felt that be bad really accomplished something .

		He took more pride in his editions of
Griesbach	PERSON	's New Testament and
Wolf	PERSON	's Homer than in any other achievement of his life .

		Bat in every undertaking he had a genuine concern for his reputation as a printer , as well as for that of Ger - many .

		It is interesting to note that
Goeschen	PERSON	rejected the plans and proposals of
Koenig	PERSON	, the inventor of the power press ; but in this he was no more conservative and incredulous than many other publishers .

		Goeschen 's biography casts no entirely new lights upon the great authors with whom he ^ ealt .

		We are indeed brought more '' humanly near '' to them , but
Wieland	PERSON	remains the kind and conscientious and fussy favorite of the masses : Goethe 's self-sufficient care for '' Num - ber One '' is intensified a shade : and
Schiller	PERSON	is still the fiery friend , the impulsive idealist , the right-meaning democrat .

		With all three of his great clients
Goeschen	PERSON	's relations were sometimes strained , and it is here that
Viscount Goschen	PERSON	manifests his most charming dis - crimination .

		More than once he admits that his grandfather was hasty and indiscreet .

		Yet if he jwints out
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's ungenerous and sus - picious habit of demanding the last penny in advance before delivering his manuscripts , it is not for the purpose of belittling the poet , though he may love the man less .

		Despite the fact that
Schiller	PERSON	grieved the generous friend ■ of his obscure and struggling youth by seeking another publisher in
Cotta	LOCATION	, the grandson is no less devoted to the '' Singer of Liberty , '' and points out how Goeschen was at fault in the misunderstanding .

		Among the interesting facts here given are the figures of the slow sale of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's col - lected works , the edition of 1786-90 , in which appeared '' Tasso '' and '' Faust '' for the first time .

		The subscription to the set went limp - ing , and the sales of the individual volumes were counted by hundreds only .

		It was many years before the first edition of
3000	DATE	copies was sold out .

		On the other hand , authors appear as receiving large honorariums whose very names are scarcely known today , such as
Muell	PERSON	- ner and
Houwald	ORGANIZATION	.

		Goeschen paid the latter for ' • The Pirates ''
2000 Thaler	PERSON	, a sum equal to what he had paid
Goethe	PERSON	for the eight vol - umes of the collected works , including the first appearance of * ' Iphigenie '' in verse , `` Tasso , '' and • • Faust '' !

		Then as now .

		great obscurities often eclipsed the great luminaries .

		The last third of Volume II. , occupied with the years from
1806	DATE	until
Goeschen	ORGANIZATION	's death , adds its contribution to the picture of decline and distress under the invasions of Napoleon : the execution of the book-seller
Palm	LOCATION	, the per - secution of
Zacharias Becker	PERSON	, the treacherous assault upon
Luetzow 's Corps	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in which were
Georg Joachim Goeschen	PERSON	II .

		and young Theo - dor
Koerner	PERSON	-RRB- , the humiliation of the
Saxon	PERSON	princes , and the horrors of the battles in and about
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Throughout all Goeschen kept his integrity . ''

		Both as a publisher and a man he could look back on an honorable and useful life .

		No corrupting books had issued from his presses , no struggling author had CTer been exploited by him .

		No activities had more stroDglr appealed to him than such as were directed to the improvement of the masses or to the higher cul - ture of women .

		Never had he forgotten the eloquent appeal of the youthful
Schiller	PERSON	to his Gohlis friends , that ' all of them should so bear themselves , each in his own vocation , that the world should miss them when they died . ' ''

		It is probable that the tjrpography and the rich illustrations of these volumes would have given pleasure to
George Joachim Goeschen	PERSON	.

		Whether he would have approved the sacrifice of the `` o-umlaut '' in his name to the inability of the English to pronounce it , may fairly be questioned .


Viscount Goschen	PERSON	might properly do as he pleased with his own name , but it seems odd to find side by side the German contemporaries
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Goschen	PERSON	.

		Of typo - graphical errors we find less than half a dozen .

		The correction of
Lewes	LOCATION	, Vol .

		I. , p. 261 , re - garding the first publication of
Faust I.	LOCATION	, is due to a misunderstanding ;
Lewes	LOCATION	is speaking of the complete
Part I. of Faust	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of course he knew of the Fragment of
1790	DATE	.

		On the whole
Goschen	PERSON	's biography of Goe - schen is an important contribution to the his - tory of German literature , as well as to the history of general culture and of the book - trade .

		* That general histories have not often found favor with the historian is an undeniable , though probably not a surprising , fact .

		The very comprehensiveness of an undertaking which attempts to cover successive periods in a score or more of nationalities would seem to prohibit that exactness which proclaims scien - tific history .

		And yet the idea of producing a successful general history has always had an attraction for historians , partly no doubt be - cause of the obstacles to be overcome , but more largely because of the recognition that general histories may provide a necessary fund of gen - eral information for men who can not hope to know all things on all subjects and periods .

		One such historian was the late Lord
Acton	PERSON	, and the result of his faith in this phase of his - torical achievement is the production of the first volume of the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History . ''

		According to the editorial preface to this volume , the plan of the work , its division into volumes and chapters , and the selection of con - tributors for specific parts , were all conceived and mapped out by
Lord Acton	PERSON	, and his gen - eral plan has been followed practically , in pre - paring the material of the twelve volumes that are to constitute the work .

		The conception of a carefully compiled general history , to be un - dertaken by men trained in scholarly selection and condensation from the writings of special - ists , is not new .

		Such work has already been performed creditably in both
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		But Lord
Acton	PERSON	's scheme differed from this in that he proposed to have the va - rious topics in each chapter of each volume written by the specialist himself , to require of the specialist a clear presentation of the most recent investigation and knowledge in his particular field , and to assign to editorial su - pervision the duty of such combination and arrangement as would result in a history con - sisting not in '' a mere string of episodes , but displaying a continuous development . ''

		This plan the editors have sought to execute .

		Any judgment upon the skill with which they have accomplished their task must be based upon three primary grounds , namely , the ability shown in combining the general topics or pe - riods treated in the different volumes , the im - portance given to the more limited phases of • The
Cambridge Moderi	LOCATION	; Histobt .

		Planned by the late
Lord Acton	LOCATION	, LL.D. ; edited by
A. W. Ward	PERSON	, Litt.D. ,
Q. W. Prothero	PERSON	, Litt.D. , and
Stanley Leathes	ORGANIZATION	,
M.A.	LOCATION	Vol .

		I. , The Renaissance ,
New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		each volume topic , and the essential merit of separate articles from the point of view of spe - cialized knowledge .

		Naturally the first of these must wait for the appearance of several volumes at least , while the third requires an expert familiarity with many subjects , which no one person is likely to claim .

		In the second par - ticular only , is any fair judgment possible upon the merit of the work .

		Meanwhile it is to be noted that the use of this plan in a gen - eral history is not only distinctly novel , but is also both attractive and inspiring , and , if suc - cessfully executed , will result in establish - ing a higher standard for general historical writing .

		Examined for an estimate of successful com - bination and due proportion , the only fair basis at present , the first volume largely realizes Lord
Acton	PERSON	's hopes .

		This volume has been made to perform a double duty in that while it covers the period , or rather the subject , of the Renaissance movements , noting their incep - tion , characteristics , and influence , it also lays that foundation in purely institutional history necessary to the proper understanding of later - volumes .

		In selecting from among the numer - ous manifestations of activity pertaining to the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, politics , economics , and social life as of primary interest in a historical sur - vey , it has been necessary to leave somewhat in the background the development and in - fluence of art , of science , and of kindred topics .

		.

		A like discrimination exists in the space de - voted to the various states of
Europe	LOCATION	.


Italy	LOCATION	is given five chapters , where
Germany	LOCATION	, Hun - gary ,
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and En - gland have but one chapter each .

		In both these instances the choice of topics is wholly logical and in accord with the general principle of proportional importance adopted by the editors .

		In some cases a balance of forces is brought out by editorial divisions , as in the assignment of Chapter V. to ''
Florence	LOCATION	: Sa - vonarola '' by Mr.
E. Armstrong	PERSON	; while Chap - ter VI .

		is entitled ``
Florence	LOCATION	:
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
L. Arthur Burd	PERSON	.

		Thus spiritual and po - litical characteristics are emphasized and con - trasted in arrangement as well as in context .

		The two contributions just mentioned are among the most attractive in the volume .

		Other notable chapters are `` The Netherlands '' by Mr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	, '' Economic Change '' by Mr.
William Cunningham	PERSON	, '' Catholic
Europe	LOCATION	'' ^ by Dr.
William Barry	PERSON	, a conservative critical narrative written from the Catholic point of view , and '' The Eve of the Reformation '' by
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJ ^ 307 Mr.
Henry Charles Lea	PERSON	, the latter writer being the only American among the seventeen con - tributors to this first volume .

		It is , however , unfair to select chapters as noteworthy where all contributors have so evidently sought to fulfill first of all the one great purpose of the original plan , -- to present a consecutive his - tory , embodying specialist knowledge , but for - saking the specialist 's methods .

		Every man has honestly sought the point of contact , the junction point , with his neighbors , and in doing so has unquestionably sacrificed at times his own favorite field and methods .

		Evidence that the contributors have felt a genuine interest in the undertaking , as well as in the particular monograph to be presented , is one of the most striking characteristics of the volume .

		The form of presentation does not differ greatly from that customarily followed in mod - ern historical works .

		There is no index , this being reserved until the publication of the last volume , but its place is well supplied for the time being by comprehensive tables of con - tents for each chapter .

		At the end of the volume there is given for each general field or topic discussed , a bibliography , which , while not purporting to be complete in any sense , can not fail to prove of great practical use to the teacher of history who wishes to purchase the available books on some special subject , or to the student who desires to know where mate - rial is to be found .

		Thus the bibliography given for Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's chapter on '' The Nether - lands '' first presents lists of special bibliog - raphies and of completed inventories of origi - nal documents with their location .

		Then follow about three hundred titles classified thus : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Collections , -LRB- 2 -RRB- Chronicles treating of the
General History	ORGANIZATION	of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, ^ 3 -RRB- Provincial and Local Chronicles , -LRB- 4 -RRB- Gen - eral History , Geography , and Institutions , -LRB- 5 -RRB- Histories of Successive Periods , -LRB- 6 -RRB- Histories of the Several Provinces , -LRB- 7 -RRB- Trade and In - dustry , -LRB- 8 -RRB- Religion , -LRB- 9 -RRB- Manners , Letters , and Art : and this is still further supplemented by cross references to the bibliographies of other chapters .

		For teachers and students who have not a sufficiently specialized knowl - edge to discriminate in the choice of books from larger bibliographies , these lists will be of much real assistance .

		No attempt has been made to judge the merits of the present volume on other ground than that of usefulness and that of realizing the primary idea of Lord
Acton	PERSON	and the editors .

		There is one characteristic however , common to all the contributors to this volume , that dis - tinctly deserves notice .

		It is the attempt to present to the reader , movements and events from the contemporary point of view , and to give just such proportion of emphasis and im - portance to events as these events held for the men who witnessed them .

		The ability to do this is in itself so peculiarly the property of the thorough student , and is so elusive and uncontrollable when assumed by one who does not know absolutely , that its existence in this volume is sufficient evidence of scientific his - torical work .

		A true appreciation of the con - temporary historical importance of men and events is the first requisite of the scholar , and the ability to interpret this clearly for the benefit of others is one of the first tests of his - torical writing .

		In this respect at least , then , the ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	, '' as illus - trated in its first volume , is unquestionably more than a compilation or a work of general reference , and is in fact , as
Lord Acton	LOCATION	hoped it would prove to be , a contribution to histori - cal knowledge possessing real historical merit .

		-LSB-
May 1	DATE	, clever men discussing the question of wages , com - mon ownership of plants , land , -- anything to make the people think . ''

		The symposium began
August 25	DATE	, and continued into
November	DATE	, -- covering , in the words of the editor of the volume in which its proceedings are now reprinted , the Rev.
John P. Peters	PERSON	, more than fifty large newspaper pages .

		The topics discussed are such as Combinations of Em - ployers and Employed , Trusts and the Labor - unions from a legal aspect , Conciliation and Ar - bitration ,
Model Industries	ORGANIZATION	, Socialism and the Single Tax , and ^ the Unemployed ; and to their dis - cussion Mr.
Hearst	PERSON	brought the pens of such men as Prof.
J. B. Clark	PERSON	, Mr.
Jacob Riis	PERSON	, Mr.
Samuel M. Jones	PERSON	, the Rev.
Josiah Strong	PERSON	, Mr.
James B. Dill	PERSON	, Mr.
H. D. Lloyd	PERSON	, Mr.
John Mitchell	PERSON	, Bishop
Potter	PERSON	,
Cardinal Gibbons	PERSON	, President
Hadley	PERSON	, and many others .

		The symposium emphasized what was al - ready pretty well known , namely , '' that the oppo - sition is not to trusts as large corporations , but rather to monopolies ; that trade-unions are and have been , highly beneficial , although overstepping at times the bounds of the law ; that arbitration is a wise method of settling disputes , but that we are not ready for compulsory settlement of labor diffi - culties ; and , finally , that the single tax is not a panacea , but a promised step to better things .

		The book is a book of opinions , and useful in show - ing what certain men think , rather than in indi - cating the actual problem or the conditions of its solution .

		Closely allied to this volume is the one on '' In - dustrial Conciliation , '' containing the proceedings of the
Chicago	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	meetings of the
National Civic Federation	ORGANIZATION	, an organization too well known , with its long list of influential members , to need any description here .

		This book has the ad - vantage of having its pages filled with the first-hand statements of men who employ and are employed - Although much that was said at the
New York	LOCATION	meet - ing was general , and oftentimes trivial , yet the reader is impressed with the good-feeling and frank - ness of speech that prevailed .

		In strength of view and clearness of statement , the papers of the
Chicago	LOCATION	meeting are decidedly above those which , according to the table of contents , were given at the
New York	LOCATION	meeting .

		There seems to have been at the latter no particular plan in the relation of the addresses to each other , each speaker being allowed to talk on the general topic , or on what was suggested by the previous speaker .

		In the
Chicago	LOCATION	meeting , however , definite topics were discussed , and on the whole with better results for the reader .

		The outcome of the meetings , in the organization of an
Industrial Committee	ORGANIZATION	and its practical work , have somewhat overshadowed the importance of the papers read at the
Chicago	LOCATION	meeting .

		In Colonel
Wright	PERSON	's volume on '' Ethical Phases of the Labor Question '' we have a collection of addresses and previously published articles dealing with a few present-day questions , such as '' Religion in Relation to Sociology , '' and `` The Relation of Political Economy to the Labor Question . ''

		There is also an essay on the Factory system , which ap - peared in part in the articles on '' Factory System '' in
Johnson	PERSON	's Cyclopsedia and the Tenth Census of the
United States	LOCATION	; and with it a paper on prison - labor , which appeared in part in an official report upon the same subject .

		The author 's note presents the point of view that actuated the publishing of the book .

		He says : '' The four essays forming the contents of this little volume have no particular correlation , except in the fact that the subjects treated are brought under the principle of ethics .

		There is no pretension of discussing broadly the labor question or general economic principles .

		While each essay is separate in its treatment , nevertheless the collection constitutes a concrete illustration of the application of moral elements to some of the important sociological questions of the day . '' ''

		The Citizen in his Relations to the Industrial Situation , '' by the Rt. .

		Rev.
Bishop Potter	PERSON	, is a book made up of matter originally delivered as lectures at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	on the
William E. Dodge	ORGANIZATION	foun - dation .

		The author seems to have missed the newer phases of the subject , and particularly in the chap - ter on '' The Industrial Situation , '' to have taken a few scattered results as the actual problem .

		The book is marred by constant side-plays diverting from the main theme of the chapter , or by long and laborious approaches to the principal point , weak - ening the effect , particularly in the chapter on Corporations .

		It is rather curious to note that the post-office , which the author uses as an argument against socialism , is regarded by eminent authority as strongly favoring the extension of government functions .

		In fact , the argument of the book against that creed may be termed `` stock argument . ''

		The last chapter is by all odds the best , and the strong words on individualism are well deserving of wide circulation .

		In the last book of the group we have the essays and addresses of an eminent prelate of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the book of a sober-minded , thought - ful man , who is opposed to socialism , yet is hard pushed by the evils of the time .

		He sees dangers not so much in the economic or political difficulties as in the departure of the people from religion and in the pitfalls of a moral decline .

		To him , a state - controlled education is likely to weaken '' one of the most essential and vital social forces , the sense of responsibility in parents , '' -- a statement which may be regarded as at least a partial non sequitur .

		Our essayist has however , confused socialism with social - ism of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a Marxian system of socialism , the government and state as we know them , are not to exist .

		Ricardo is made to bear the burden of originating the doctrine , -- a popular error which the reading of the introduction to
Gonner	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
Ricardo	LOCATION	's works would largely dispel .

		The style of the essays is delightful and at times brilliant .

		A shea / of poetic dramas .

		Four volames of dramatic verse upon Biblical subjects have recently come to our table .

		The Knicker - bocker Press -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- publishes ''
David and Bathshua	PERSON	, '' a drama in five acts by Mr.
Charles Whitworth Wynne	PERSON	.

		The relation has been found attractive to dramatists from
Peele	LOCATION	to Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, and the heroine is our old friend , the wife of
Uriah	PERSON	, although the spelling of the name is a novelty .

		Mr.
Wynne	PERSON	's blank verse is not distinguished .

		Mr.
Thomas Ewing , Jr.	PERSON	, is the author of a tragedy entitled ''
Jonathan	PERSON	, '' and published by the
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the familiar story from the Book of
Samuel I.	PERSON	, and is elaborated in five acts of mingled verse and prose .

		The author , we are informed , is a patent lawyer .

		He writes rather better verse than Mr.
Wynne	PERSON	, but it is not far removed from prose .

		Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	's ''
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, comes nearer to being literature .

		It is a nativity play , and naivete is its note .

		There are two acts , and many lyrical passages lend variety to the verse .

		The play has been performed , and we should think it might prove effective in a simple way .

		Mr.
Henry Copley Greene	PERSON	's volume , published by the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	, gives us not one play but three .

		Their titles are '' Pontius Pilate , '' '' Saint
Ronan of Brittany	PERSON	, '' and '' Th ^ ophile . ''

		The first is a mystery in three acts ; the other two are miracle plays of a single act each .

		Mr.
Greene	PERSON	does little more than play with mediaevalism , but he gives us many touches of true poetry .

		Plays in verse have been multiplying of late , for besides the four just mentioned we have several others .

		Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	's comedy of * ' The Canterbury Pilgrims , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, gives us as char - acters the whole twenty-nine of the
Tabard Inn	ORGANIZATION	, besides a dozen or more others , including the
King	PERSON	, the Archbishop of
Canterbury	LOCATION	,
John of Gaunt	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wycliffe	PERSON	.

		There are four acts , and the play is in - tended for stage representation .

		Sentimental rela - tions between the Poet and the Prioress form the basis of the argument , but there is much variety of scene , and the author shows himself a loving stu - dent of Chaucer .

		The work has a most engaging mien , and we are much taken with the best parts of the author 's verse .

		Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	gives us a volume of serious poetic art in the form of three plays published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		`` Ralegh in
Guiana	LOCATION	'' is a two-part drama in the Elizabethan manner , which presents in fine blank verse an episode in the later career of the explorer , besides embodying after a fashion the author 's phi - losophy of history as far as it is concerned with the subject in hand . ''

		Rosamond '' is a single scene versifying
Percy	PERSON	's ballad . ''

		A
Christmas Masque	ORGANIZATION	, '' for which Mr.
Winthrop	PERSON	Ames provided the plot , is a club pageant based upon the period of the crusades .

		These experiments in the Elizabethan manner are more than interesting ; they are digni - fied productions that have a high degree of literary value .

		Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	's '' The Black Prince '' published by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, is a four-act play in verse that is respectable and at times impassioned .

		Mistress
Alice Ferrers	PERSON	acts a conspicuous and sin - gular part .

		A few short poems are gathered into the volume which contains this play .

		Mrs.
Margaret L. Woods	PERSON	has found in the early history and rela - tions of G `` orge I. of
England	LOCATION	an excellent subject for her five-act drama '' The Princess of
Hanover	LOCATION	, '' ^ issued by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is much prose mingled with the blank verse , besides some exceptionally beautiful lyrics , and the whole is done in a fair imitation of the Elizabethan manner .

		The last play on our list is ' ■
Maximilian	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	, published by Mr.
Richard	PERSON	6 .

		Badger .

		It is a well-planned production , and the five acts of verse contain many passages that ar - rest the attention , but the subject -- which is that of the ill-starred Mexican Empire -- is too modern to lend itself to a thoroughly poetic treatment .

		Mr.
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	has chosen this Bmtrton dewed Spring as an opportune time for giv - ai close range , , * ^ ' , * , .

		= mg to the public the second vol - ume in his series of reminiscences of the
Concord	LOCATION	philosophers , -- '' The Personality of Emerson . ''

		^ Similar in intention to `` The Personality of Thorean , '' it is published by Mr.
Charles E. Good	PERSON	- speed in a handsomely-printed limited edition , uniform with the earlier volume .

		The portrait is etched from that painted by
David Scott	PERSON	at
Edin	ORGANIZATION	- burgh in
1848	DATE	, and there are two facsimile letters .

		The book is a brief and somewhat desultory record of conversations , anecdotes , and impressions gath - ered during Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's long acquaintance with
Emerson	PERSON	, which dates back to
1852	DATE	.

		One pecu - liarity of the memoir is that , in spite of its intimacy , it gives no hint of faults or failings in its subject .


Henry James	PERSON	, Senior , and
Alcott	PERSON	, called Emerson '' the nnfallen man , '' and Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	accepts the judgment Other friends , to be sure ,
Ellery Channing	PERSON	among them , complained of finding him capriciously cold and distant at times ; but this , Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	thinks , was '' a part of his fate rather than an element in his disposition . ''

		It was quite insep - arable from his deeply poetic , spiritual way of life , and was more than offset by his wide sympathy for struggling causes and unfortunate individuals and his gentle tolerance for the eccentricities of genius exhibited by some of his transcendentalist friends .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	began to read
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	before he was sixteen .

		While still an undergraduate at
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	he knew the great man intimately , and his account of the little group of Emersonians at Har - vard and of
Emerson	LOCATION	's kindly response to their youthful enthusiasm is most interesting .

		Towards the end of his senior year Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	received an offer from
Emerson	LOCATION	to become the teacher of a small school in
Concord	LOCATION	.

		He boarded with
Ellery	ORGANIZATION	810 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Ohanning , met
Thoreau	LOCATION	, walked , and swam or skated on
Walden	LOCATION	, with
Alcott	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, took part in the famous `` conversations , '' -- in short , he had an unrivaled opportunity to see
Concord	LOCATION	, `` land of Hyperbole and Humor , '' as he calls it , at close range .

		Then and later -- for he continued to live in
Concord	LOCATION	-- he saw
Emerson	PERSON	in companionship with his great contemporaries , and he reproduces , as they fell from
Emerson	PERSON	's lips , his estimates of each .

		He tells of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's habits of thought and of life , and repeats his table-talk and forgotten bits of his lectures .

		He does all this very informally , with little effort to systematize his material or to summarize his conclusions , and with no attempt at all to startle with novel views or epigramatic state - ments .

		As he says in his final paragraph , he has simply written down a little first-hand information about
Emerson	PERSON	, leaving the facts '' to bear their own testimony to his character , '' and hoping , since no wholly adequate memoir of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	has yet been written , to add something of value to the composite '' colossal portraiture '' of a great and good man .

		A new study Notwithstanding the many years that o/ToUtoi ' i
Tolstoi	PERSON	has been in the eyes of the life and art .

		public , a fellow countryman ,
Dmitri Merejkowski	PERSON	, has given us the first complete study of the great Russian .

		In his book , which now ap - pears in an English translation with the title `` Tolstoi as Man and Artist '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , he has treated the subject from a new psychological point of view ; he has analyzed the various traits of the man , traced the growth of his character with detail and precision , and described the events and meth - ods of a long career .

		The author points out that in Russian society , and to some extent among critics , the opinion has taken root that about
1878	DATE	there took place in
Tolstoi	LOCATION	a moral and religious change , -- a change which radically transformed not only the whole of his own life , but also his intellectual and literary activity .

		In the first period he was looked upon only as a great writer ; in the second , he shook off the trammels of historical life and culture .

		Today some say he is a Christian cham - pion ; others , an atheist ; others a fanatic ; others still that he is a sage who has attained the highest moral illumination , and , like
Socrates	PERSON	,
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and Confucius , become the founder of a new religion .

		It is to the second period of his life that the present author has devoted particular attention .

		From our own reading of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	we believe that at heart he concedes that the principle of authority -LRB- whether it be the Catholic principle of Church authority , or the Protestant principle of Scriptural authority -RRB- is no longer competent to subjugate the sceptical temper of the age ; and he insists , not altogether unreason - ably , that if we are to continue regarding Christian - ity as a veritable divine institution , we must bestir ourselves to find an enduring basis for it in the ac - knowledged truths of human nature and human science .

		What the follower of Tolstoi demands of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is some assured , not any probable or tentative , knowledge of God ; that is to say , he de - mands a revelation of the divine name ample to conciliate not merely the spiritual but the rational , and even the sensuous , homage of mankind .

		And by attempting to aid his imagination by any spec - iousness of ratiocination , you simply encourage fur - ther intellectual doubt .

		Mr.
Merejkowski	PERSON	, in por - traying his subject 's life , has endeavored to show where intellectual power fails , and where lies the peculiar greatness of the man .

		His analysis is thrown into relief throughout by bringing it into comparison with the extraordinary contrast of the career and work of
Dostoievski	LOCATION	, whose birth , cir - cumstances , art , ideals , and character were nearly antithetic to those of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	.

		The author has per - formed his work conscientiously ; there has been no improper discrimination , such as selections from private correspondence , yet nothing is omitted which would tend to develop the real character of the man .

		In fact , the book is commendable be - cause of its lucidity and directness of argument , as well as for its comprehensiveness of scope .

		Thetioryof ^ '' '' ^ `` The Life and Career of Major Major
Andri John Andr	PERSON	^ , '' Mr.
Winthrop Sar	PERSON	- agam re-told .

		gent , too soon carried away from his labors in the fields of historical research , has pictured one of the most interesting episodes in the War of the Revolution .

		The record of
Andre	ORGANIZATION	's youth , with its many friendships and its one passion , has brought many to the conclusion that the coun - try 's cause would have been better served had Ar - nold 's neck been slipped into
Andre	PERSON	's noose .

		The story of the unfortunate victim of military necessity begins with love that resulted in disappointment .

		We are given glimpses of noted people with whom he was in friendly relation , whose characters are painted with clever strokes , the light and shade of each being well preserved : Miss
Anna Seward	PERSON	-LRB- `` Julia , '' as she called herself in her lively letters -RRB- ; the
Corinna of Lichfield	PERSON	, a few of whose stilted heroic lines have picked their way down to poster - ity in virtue of the events and characters with which they dealt ;
Richard Lovell Edgeworth	PERSON	, who carried off the object of Andre 's attachment , the fair
Honora Sneyd	PERSON	; the fascinating
Honora	PERSON	herself , who made everybody in love with her , and , as she could not love everybody , by her refusal sent poor `` cher Jean '' -LRB- Andr ^ -RRB- to the wars , to become a convicted spy and die a felon 's death -- a death which was commemorated by a stately monument in West - minster
Abbey	LOCATION	, and by the removal of the remains to that sepulchre of kings .

		The author touches upon the events of history with scrupulous fidelity .

		The incidents which led to the situation where
Arnold	PERSON	's treason brought him into relation with Andr ^ , -- the intrigues , the indiscretions , the blun - ders that ended so disastrously , -- are so recorded as to make the work at once '' a romance , a tragedy , and a passage of history . ''

		Mr.

		As a work of reference , his

		He takes life heartily , and delights to reproduce , in lively colors , the more significant bits of his varied experience in many lands .

Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, with whom he was inti - mate in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's den in that city is immortalized in '' The Wrecker . ''

		In fact , the story of their friendship is given in detail in that novel , in the chapter called '' Faces on the City Front . ''

		Some of
Stevenson	PERSON	's clever and amusing impromptu verses enliven Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's pages .

		Other interesting personal items relate to
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	,
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	,
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	, -- and
George Eliot	PERSON	; for , as a young Amer - ican visiting
London	LOCATION	, he enjoyed the rare privilege of being admitted to one of the
Sunday	DATE	afternoons at the Priory .

		Travel sketches , from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to
Hawaii	LOCATION	, help to swell this pleasant volume .

		In fact , rather too many of its pages are pen-pictures , delightful to the writer , no doubt , and recalling delicious memories of dear departed days , but less enthralling to the cold-blooded reader .

		The chief fault , indeed , of Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's style lies in his constant striving for the picturesque , at the expense of terseness and restraint .

		Shunning the common - place , he occasionally leaves common-sense also be - hind , and achieves the nonsensical , as when he speaks of '' the tart dews of dusk '' and ' * the im - possible Southern moon . ''

		His syntax is not im - peccable .

		He indulges in the dangling participle .

		A more heart-rending instance of a lonesome par - ticiple with no protecting noun or pronoun in sight .

		to which to attach itself , could hardly be imagined than the following , referring to Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's first meeting with
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	: ' - Having warned me of his approach , I was on the lookout . ''

		This , from a university professor of English literature , is a bit startling .

		Tmg -- ditvu - '' ^ ^ ' ■ ■ * three of the promised ten mrntat/Trntu Tolumes of `` The
Burton Holmes Lec	ORGANIZATION	- t ` arOtevtA .

		tures '' -LRB-
Litt	PERSON	-RSB-
e-Preston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have come to hand , and the impression made at the beginning of the publication of this fine series is strengthened by their examination .

		But the recommendation to accompany the work and conclude it with a complete and thoroagh index has not been taken , and the failure deprives the entire ten volumes of mneh of their potential efficiency as works of reference .

		The plan of the initial volumes is preserved throughout , each containing three lectures .

		Of the volumes un - der consideration , the eighth deals with St.
Peter	PERSON	- burg ,
Moscow	LOCATION	, and the Trans-Siberian Railway as far as Stryetensk ; the ninth with the voyage down the Amur and the arrival at
Vladivostok	LOCATION	, the city of Peking as known to strangers , and the secret or forbidden city ; and the tenth with
Seoul	LOCATION	, the capi - tal of
Corea	LOCATION	, the country-side in
Japan	LOCATION	, and the Japanese cities of
Tokyo	LOCATION	and Kyoto .

		Each lecture is preceded by a colored frontispiece of artistic worth , and the number of reproduced photographs is nothing less than astonishing , their quality and interest considered .

		It is but right to mention , in closing an account of this admirable series of books , that they show the latest developments in the vari - ous processes of book manufacture , and most ade - quately clothe the well-told narratives of engrossing journeys over the earth .

		Altie ^ The `` Journal of Arthur Stirling '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- is in some respects a re - markable performance , but vexatious withal .

		The newspaper death-notice copied in the preface , -- '' Stirling : By suicide in the
Hudson River	LOCATION	, poet and man of genius , in the twenty-second year of his age , '' -- gives a suspicion of clap-trap to the whole .

		Nevertheless the story has power .

		The berating which this '' poet and man of genius '' gives the publishers because they will not publish his poem - The Captive , '' which he has brought forth with such agony of soul , is hysterical and some - times ill-tempered .

		`` A publisher is not in the busi - ness for the furtherance of Art , or for the uplifting of humanity , or for the worship of God . ''

		That is his final quarrel with the world .

		He is too great a man .

		it seems , to compromise with life , or even with religion . ''

		The sublime duty of being damned is ever my reply to theological impertinences . ''

		Alto - gether this journal intime is youthful , egotistic , perfervid , one inclines to say impossible ; yet its intensity has the air of genuineness , and it is pro- foundly in earnest in its devotion to art .

		It is so good -- or it might easily have been so good -- that the clap-trap is unbearable , because unnecessary .

		The story might have been told truly , and a little more calmly , and it would have earned a place among the well-read tales of unappreciated genius .

		Cow ^ UfSmmf Mr.
Alexander Teixera de Mattos	PERSON	has reason to congratulate himself upon the successful issue of his mon - umental labor of translation .

		With the recent pub - lication of Volumes V. and VI .

		.

		the first adequate English version of Chateaubriand 's '' M ^ moires d'outre Tombe '' is completed -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Neither Chateaubriand 's -LCB- > ersonality nor his style changed appreciably in the thirty years during which he pre - pared his Memoirs , and there is consequently little to say of these volumes that has not already been said of the other four -LRB- see The Diai < for Jane 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, 16 ,
1902	DATE	-RRB- .

		The last few books are like the first few , -- less crowded than the middle portions with refer - ences to obscure contemporaries , full of picturesque description of long journeys taken in behalf of the exiled Bourbons , of literary and historical associa - tions connected with the cities visited , of dubious reflections upon the decline of monarchy in
Europe	LOCATION	, and ardent expressions of attachment to the old rSgime .

		It is to the old rSgime that Chateaubriand belongs , whether as statesman , writer , or philoso - pher ; and his vogue is past .

		But his charm is enduring .

		Vain , and a , poseur , he may be ; but he is admirable even in his affectations .

		It is typical of him that his cat ,
Micelto	PERSON	, was brought up in the folds of a papal robe .

		And his kings , even to poor
Charles X.	PERSON	, are re-crowned with a halo of romance before he is done with them .

		A great man , truly ; and his great book furnishes us with the clue to his fascinating personality .

		No one will ever attempt to write Chateaubriand 's biography ; Mr.
de Mattos	PERSON	has therefore done English literature a great service by his painstaking and thoroughly ex - cellent translation of the Memoirs .

		In his little volume on '' Greek and iuditcipUt .

		Roman Stoicism , and Some of Its Disciples '' -LRB-
H. B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
Charles H. Stanley Davis	PERSON	can hardly be said to have done full credit to his various degrees and the manifold learned societies to which he belongs .

		The book is not an adequate exposition of Stoicism as such , nor does it present a sufficient portrayal of the individual Stoics who are considered .

		The book is careless in its grammatical structure , and still worse in its rhetoric .

		Freemen for freedmen , SkXxA presentiments for presentments , may be passed as errors of the type-setter ; Laertius for Laelius can hardly be let off so easily .

		But what shall we say when the noted embassy of philosophers who came to
Rome	LOCATION	in the year 155 B. C. are made to associate with the poet
Lucretius	PERSON	, born some fifty years later ?

		Dr.
Davis	PERSON	seems somewhat at sea too , as to the make - up and purpose of this fa - mous embassy .

		The Latinist will groan over a ref - erence to the '' De Officia '' of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		On the whole , the book impresses one as indicating that its author has had quite too many irons in the fire for successful work .

America	LOCATION	, the
Rhode Island Society of Colonial Dames	ORGANIZATION	has undertaken the publication of the correspondence of the Colonial Governors of that colony from
1723	DATE	to
1775	DATE	-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The first volume is now published , covering the years between
1723	DATE	and
1746	DATE	.

		A second volume is to complete the work .

		The preface announces that the correspondence of the sixty - four years prior to
1729	DATE	has `` completely disappeared . ''

		The sources of Colonial history here disclosed have been inaccessible to students remote from the written archives of the state ; hence their appearance in print confers a public benefit .

		For - tunately , the manuscripts have not been edited , but retain their original wording and spelling .

		The annotation , by Mrs.
Gertrude Selwyn Kimball	PERSON	is laudably brief and apparently correct .

		A number of portraits of early Governors lends a pleasant aspect to the work .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
Philip Schuyler Allen	PERSON	and
James Taft	PERSON	Hat - field have edited , and
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	has published , a diary kept by the German poet
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	, and discovered by the late
Max Miiller	PERSON	among his father 's papers .

		The text as here given is described as a '' diplomatic '' reproduction of the manuscript , which we take to mean that personalities have been omitted , and perhaps other changes made .

		There are also printed a series of the poet 's letters , written be - tween
1816	DATE	and
1827	DATE	, and the entire matter is carefully annotated and indexed .

		There is also a portrait .

		The diary is only a fragment , covering about a year , but it is of considerable literary and historical interest , and its publication is creditable alike to editors and publishers .

		Professor
James Harvey Robinson	PERSON	is the author of '' An Introduction to the History of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, '' prepared for secondary schools , and published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It extends from the barbarian invasions and the breaking-up of the
Western Empire	ORGANIZATION	to the close of the nineteenth century .

		Its chief aims are thus stated : '' Institutions under which
Europe	LOCATION	has lived for cen - turies , above all the Church , have been discussed with a good deal more fulness than is usual in similar manuals .

		The life and work of a few men of indubitably first-rate importance have been treated with care proportionate to their significance for the world .

		Not only the po - litical , but also the economic , intellectual , and artistic achievements of the past form an integral part of the narrative . ''

		In spite of the omission of much of the tra - ditional matter , this programme requires a larger hook than usual , and there are upwards of seven hundred pages , including many pictures and an extensive series of maps . ''

		Representative Art of Our Time '' is the subject of the latest and most ambitions of the popular art publi - cations emanating from the office of '' The Studio '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The work is issued in eight monthly parts , three of which are now ready .

		Each part con - tains half a dozen plates , separately printed and mounted ou heavy paper , and by way of text an authoritative short essay on some phase of modern art activity .

		The il - lustrations , many of them made especially for this work , are representative of nearly every medium used in the modern graphic arts .

		In the case of etchings , lithographs , woodcuts , etc. , the print is made directly from the artist 's block .

		The collection thus brought together , while some - what uneven in quality , is of great interest , and contains a few really fine plates -- as for instance Mr.
Max Pietschmann	PERSON	's mezzotint , `` The Bather . ''

		With the final part the editor , Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	, will supply an in - troduction , giving among other matter an account of the various processes employed in the production of the il - lustrations .

		Published at the moderate price of a dollar a part , the work should make a strong appeal to every - one interested in current art .

		A Descriptive Guide to the Best Fiction , British and American '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- compiled by Mr.
Ernest A. Baker	PERSON	, is -LRB- l volume containing nearly five thousand references , classified according to countries and periods , briefly but helpfully annotated , and elaborately indexed .

		The usefulness of such a work needs no exposition , and Mr.
Baker	PERSON	deserves the hearty thanks of librarians , teachers , and general readers for having given them this inclusive and conscientious bibliography .

		Although of English origin , the work by no means neglects American fiction , and , while we might supply many missing titles of importance , we are on the whole sur - prised by the completeness and modernity of the Amer - ican list .

		There have been so many recent editions of Carlyle 's '' French Revolution '' that we have completely lost track of them .

		The three-volume edition , edited by Mr.
John Holland Rose	PERSON	and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is , however , so much more than a mere reprint that it deserves a word of special mention .

		It has an intro - duction , extensive annotations , and a series of illustra - tions , all of which greatly enhance its value , and make of it a critical edition that is of real use for the study of the subject .

		The illustrations are portraits , plans , and reproductions of old prints , many of them of the highest interest .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	is a competent scholar , and this edition may be confidently recommended to students of French history .

		afespere A NEW EDITION OF SHAKSPERE 'S WORKS WITH CRITICAL TEXT IN ELIZABETHAN ENGLISH AND BRIEF NOTES ILLUSTRATIVE OF ELIZABETHAN LIFE THOUGHT AND IDIOM By MARK HARVEY
LIDDELL Edition de Luxe	ORGANIZATION	limited to 250 sets .

		The most beau - tiful American book thus far .

		Mr.
Theodore L. DeVinne	PERSON	writes : `` I regard these books '' -LRB- the VARIORUM FITZ GERALD and ELIZABETHAN SHAKS - PERE -RRB- , `` and especially the Sbakspere , as my best workmanship in typography . ''

		1 .

		It is the most beautiful set of books ever issued from an American press .

		2 .

		A new type , modeled from that used by the Venetian printer ,
Franz Renner	PERSON	, in his Qnadragesiraale ,
1472	DATE	.

		It is considered superior to the
Jensen	PERSON	adopted by
William Morris	PERSON	, and reproduces the highest achieTement of fifteenth - century design .

		Mr.
DeVinne	PERSON	had it cut to show that beauty and legibility depend not so much on blackness or thickness of type-stems as on instant visibility of every line .

		3 .

		A style of composition in which the notes form a complementary frame to the page -- nsed by early printers for their finest annotated classics , but abandoned till now on account of its mechanical difficulties and expense .

		4 .

		The proportions of type to a page and the series of facing pages have been stndied and adapted from the best work of the great
Cologne	LOCATION	printer ,
Henry Qnentell	PERSON	.

		5 .

		The text is in 14 point , instantly legible and restfnl to the eye , while the notes are much larger than is nsual in Sbakspere editions .

		6 .

		The notes read continuously , and are on the same pag `` as the text .

		All citations are also given on the page .

		The reader gets
Shakspere	ORGANIZATION	's thought in the light of modem scholarship , without leaving his library chair .

		.

		■ x i ^ 7 .

		Each volume has a brief introduction containing the essential facts relative to the date of composition , sources , plot , characters , and literary features of the play .

		8 .

		Each scene has an introductory note outlining the action , and each act is followed by a summary of the play up to the following act .

		- ' ^ A '' 9 .

		An elaborate index , in itself a dictionary , enables the student to group together the various • ' * '' pecidiar features or to find meanings or idioms that interest him .

		TTie sixty colunms of wy ^ index in MACBETH are a storehouse of inestimable value .

		If one wishes , for instance , .

		^ J to known what words in this play have been amended by different editors , he merely turns to page 235 , where , under '' Emendations , '' is a list with full references .

		^ ^ There has never been any similar feature of a Sbakspere so ingeniously devised - ^ i ' and so thoroughly worked out .

		10 .

		In a word this is the perfect Sbakspere thus far -- remarkable in beauty and in ease of reading .

		The average man can not read the plays intelligently without it .

		With it , he needs nothing else : no dictionaries to consult , no grammars to refer to , not even cross-references to look up .

		BRIEFER MENTION 343 NOTES ai3 LIST OF N'EW BOOKS 344 Upon several occasions daring the past twelve years we have spwken of the work done by the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	under the scholarly and exacting leadership of Mr.
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	, and of the self-sacrificing devotion of the small group of pablic-spirited men and women whose generous contributions have made possible the continued existence of this organization for the higher musical education of the public .

		The American city which above most others is given up to tlie spirit of com - mercialism would be in evil case before the bar of judgment were it not for a few such agencies as this
Orchestra	LOCATION	, which advertise to the world that we are not altogether given up to the pur - suit of gain .

		Time was when
Chicago	LOCATION	had for exhibition to its visitors from abroad nothing more inspiring than its
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	and ito Stock Yards ; having seen these , oar visitors had seen what was most typical of the city , and were suffered to depart , not exactly in peace , but with the recollection of a startling and unique experience .

		We have changed all
this during the last ten years	DATE	.

		The new era began with the World 's Fair of
1893	DATE	, for we then made the discovery that there might be matter of greater interest to visitors than the slaughter of cattle and the antics of frenzied speculators in wheat and corn .

		Strangers were still politely curious about these things , but somehow they seemed to receive deeper impressions from the exhibit of modem paintings and the
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our grain elevators and oar operations in beef and pork became less inter - esting for the nonce than our strivings after beauty and truth .

		It was an interesting crisis in our civic life , and its lessons were taken to heart .

		The ten years that have passed since
Chicago	LOCATION	invited the world to an exhibit in which , for the first time in her history , the ideal was made more prominent than the material , have witnessed a constant broadening of our horizon , and a steadily increasing interest in those things that make for the higher life of mankind .

		The ma - terial basis remains -- it always must remain , -- but there is now a creditable ideal superstrno - 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, ture , and it shares in the pride with which we view the sum total of our achievements .

		The claims of education , and of art , and of litera - ture , are now freely allowed in quarters where they were but grudgingly admitted a few years ago , and along with this quickening of our civic consciousness in the direction of aspiration and aesthetic endeavors there has come into the grosser atmosphere of our political life a puri - fying influence that has already accomplished wonders of reform , and is full of promise for the future .

		Among the civilizing agencies that have been working this gradual but very real change none has stood higher than the
Chicago	LOCATION	Or - chestra , and it was a severe shock to the culti - vated public to be told , as we were about two months ago , that the continued existence of the organization was doubtful .

		For twelve years now
Chicago	LOCATION	has been accustomed to its regu - lar annual season of twenty or more concerts , each given twice , and it is not easy to contem - plate the possibility of getting along without their uplifting influence .

		The announcement made by the trustees of the organization was to the effect that the yearly deficit continued to be large , that the number of men willing to assume it was growing smaller all the time , and that unless the public should step in and take this burden from their shoulders , they would be compelled to give up the undertak - ing as hopeless .

		An appeal was made for an en - dowment of three-quarters of a
million dollars	MONEY	, which amount would suffice to purchase a lot and erect a building that should be the per - manent home of the Orchestra .

		With the owner - ship of such a piece of property , the Orchestra could safely count upon making both ends meet in the future , besides having greatly enlarged opportunities for the furtherance of its work .

		The situation , as developed by twelve years of experience , appears to be that the public may be counted upon to pay three-fourths of the cost of the concerts each year , but that the other fourth must come from an endowment or from some form of annual subsidy .

		This is really a remarkable showing , for it means an average attendance of nearly twenty-five hun - dred paying listeners , twice every week , at a series of concerts strictly educational and cul - tural in purpose , under the leadership of a man whose standards are of the highest , and who will not make the slightest concession to an unthinking popular demand .

		To give the pub - lic the music that it needs , instead of the music that it thinks it wants , has always been the guiding principle in the distinguished career of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	, and he has put this principle into practice more uncompromisingly than ever be - fore during these twelve years of his
Chicago	LOCATION	leadership .

		The
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	must not for a moment be classed with institutions or - ganized for the purpose of entertainment .

		If it were that , one might reasonably demand that it justify its existence by becoming self - supporting .

		But we must rank it with such institutions as universities and libraries and art museums , that no one expects to be self - supporting , and that would lose something of their dignity were they wholly dependent upon the returns for the services which they render .

		Thus viewed , the fact that the Orchestra calls for no larger endowment than will provide for one-fourth of its running expenses brings a highly significant tribute to the educational value of the work that it has accomplished .

		Two months ago , it was proclaimed that un - less the necessary sum were subscribed within a few weeks , the organization would be dis - banded , and the men who had so generously supported it would give up their thankless task .

		It was for the public to show its appreciation of their work by coming forward and relieving them of the burden .

		To this appeal the public has responded generously , and in the space of about two months considerably more than half of the needed sum has been pledged by several thousand subscribers .

		The expression of pop - ular interest thus given has proved so grati - fying that the trustees have been persuaded to modify their original resolution , to make con - tracts for another season of concerts under the old conditions , and to trust that a year of fur - ther effort will complete the required endow - ment , and place the Orchestra beyond the need of further help .

		They have announced as their ultimatum that unless the endowment is thus completed during the coming year they will make no further effort to continue the work of the organization .

		In that case , the thirteenth season will prove the last , and those who put their faith in omens will wag their heads saga - ciously at this new confirmation of a pet super - stition .

		We can not bring ourselves to believe that such will be the outcome of an enterprise in every way so praiseworthy .

		While the issue will remain in doubt as long as any considerable fraction of the required amount is unpledged , the situation may certainly be described as en - couraging .

		The success of the undertaking will mean much to the higher interests of
Chicago	LOCATION	.


1903	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 327 It will secure us in the possession of a body of masicians whose training has now reached so high a degree of excellence that it may safely challenge comparison with any similar body in the world .

		It will secure to us also the closing years -- and may they be many -- of a con - ductor whose single-minded devotion to his art has been beyond all praise , and has made him one of the greatest benefactors of our age .

		It will give dignity to both band and leader by transferring them from rented quarters , with all the obvious inconveniences thereon attend - ant , to a noble building consecrated in perpe - tuity to one of the noblest of the arts .

		And it will give to the
Orchestral Association	ORGANIZATION	oppor - tunities hitherto denied them for the extension of their work .

		This aspect of the case , perhaps the most important of all , has not been given its due prominence in the recent discussion of the subject .

		The
Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	will then be able to supply the public with all the concerts for which there shall be an effective demand .

		Elxceptionally attractive programmes may be repeated , additional series of concerts less se - verely classical may be provided for , and the old fashion of
summer	DATE	concerts , which we have missed for many years , may be restored under almost ideal conditions .

		We now look forward with measurable confidence to the realization of all these good things in the near future , for we need fear only the apathy which sometimes follows upon enthusiastic effort for a worthy end , and defeats the most promising plans in the hour of their seeming achievement .

		That this disaster may not overtake the foundation now so nearly laid must be the prayer of every lover of music and every friend of the higher cult - ure in this country .

		EMEBSOX AS A PUBLIC SPEAKER .

		To win fame by spoken as well as by written words has been the fortane of comparatively few men of letters .

		Distiogaiehed scholars may be Btimalating in the college class-room , bat on the popular lecture-platform their manners are often too academic , their terms too technical , to win en - thasiaem .

		An author of repate is always a gaest of honor , bat one is often disappointed in listening to his lectures or reading ; while popular lectures in published form seldom deserve to rank as litera - ture of a high gjade .

		Emerson had qualities of mind and temperament which charmed both listeners and readers .

		Be - versing the usaal sequence , he gained fame as a lecturer before he addressed the public as an author , i The gnccessful sale of his later volumes resulted , to a large extent , from his lectures in his own country and in
England	LOCATION	.

		Without any hint of disparage - ment of their literary quality , it must be granted that the noble benignity of
Emerson	LOCATION	's personality and voice largely increased the popularity of his published works .

		From earliest manhood he recognized that be was ■ ' a man with a message . ''

		While teaching , true selfhood was , by his confession , '' already writ - ing in my chamber my first thoughts on morals and the beautiful laws of compensation and of individual genios which to observe and illustrate have g ^ ven sweetness to many years of my life '' -LRB- ''
Emerson	PERSON	in
Concord	LOCATION	, '' p. 31 -RRB- .

		At first thoQght , especially in his day , the natural medium for voicing this message was the pulpit .

		From the first , however , he questioned his fitness for a typical
New England	LOCATION	ministry .

		He doubted if be would have been ordained had he been examined , when called to the pulpit of ' * the Mather dynasty . ''

		Even in his first sermon to his people , he warned them that he should `` insist on elbow-room in preach - ing . '' '

		This freedom of thought and conscience , culminating in open challenge to formal prayers and the symbolic eueharist , was never aggressive or sensational in expression .

		Emerson 's breadth and fearlessness of mind were no less characteristic than his humble sincerity and tolerance .

		These qualities , united with rare grace of manner , perva - ded his scattered pulpit utterances , from the ordina - tion sermon in
1829	DATE	to the last sermon , on Worship , at
Nantucket	LOCATION	in
1847	DATE	.

		Disappointed in the hope that his congregation would accept his radical views on modes of religion , he nevertheless advocated individual decision and harmony of relationship .

		When he gave the
Right Hand of Fellowship	ORGANIZATION	to the
Concord	LOCATION	pastor , Mr.
Goodwin	PERSON	, in
1830	DATE	, he used the words now found in the rare pamphlet containing his brief charge : '' Christianity aims to teach the perfection of human nature , and eminently , there - fore , does it teach the unity of the spirit Bnt it speaks first to its own disciples : be of one mind , else with what countenance should the church say to the world of men , ' love one another . ' ''

		When the dissolution of his pastorate had been completed , with absolute tenderness and regret to both pastor and people , he never questioned their position nor his own .

		He took anew the vow of ded - ication * ' to the love and service of tbe same eternal cause , -- the advancement , namely , of the kingdom of God in the hearts of men . ''

		The musical voice and gracions manner of this '' poet - preacher '' re - mained an heritage in the memory of his parish - ioners through life .

		His reading of hymns was often recalled , -- that ability , which he urged on all , to ' • read sense and poetry '' into ideals of life .

		From the liberal attitude of present-day thought , it is difficult to realize the tense feeling aroused by his quiet non-conformity .

		While his repugnance to for - malism led him to a position where few Christians could follow him , in his day or ours , yet doubt and gloom were aUens to his mind ; he was ever a 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, consecrated preacher of righteousness .

		To sincere preachers , of whatever denomination , he gave honor .

		Though he was the victim of attack by a few bigoted ministers and critics , his personal charm and toler - ance , both in the pulpit and outside , won him many enthusiastic friends who smiled in covert sympathy at Father
Taylor	PERSON	's response to hints of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's future in perdition , -- that '' emigration would surely tend that way . ''

		After leaving his church , when a few months of foreign travel had scattered the melancholy due to this experience and his wife 's death , his thoughts turned toward another possible mode of expression for the messages of moral and spiritual elevation which , he felt , demanded utterance .

		A new sense of freedom , of prospective contact with a wider au - dience , came upon him .

		In his journal he wrote : `` I have sometimes thought that to be a good min - ister it was necessary to leave the ministry . ''

		And again , in attestation of his sincerity of purpose : '' Henceforth I design not to utter any speech , poem , or book , that is not entirely and peculiarly my work .

		I will say , at public lectures , and the like , those things which I have meditated for their own sake , and not for the first time with a view to that occasion '' -LRB-
November 15 , 1834	DATE	; ''
Emerson	PERSON	in
Concord	LOCATION	, '' p. 54 -RRB- .

		In these simple words may be read the secret of
Emerson	LOCATION	's success alike in his addresses and writings .

		He was no temporizer , no self-advertising sensationalist .

		He had thoughts to share with his audience , ideals gathered from reading and medi - tation ; such had inspired him , and might become a '' divining-rod to their deeper natures . ''

		In a survey of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's addresses , one finds three distinct types , -- the oratorical , the scientific and biographical , and the literary and ethical .

		His earliest spoken discourses had marked oratorical features , yet difEered from the average occasional oration by depth of thought .

		Such were the '' His - torical Address at
Concord	LOCATION	'' in
1835	DATE	, '' The Amer - ican Scholar '' before the Phi Beta Kappa in
1837	DATE	, and the `` Lecture on the Times '' in
1841	DATE	.

		While this form of speech was less frequent in later years , yet there were a few famous orations on record , -- the '' Seventh of
March	DATE	'' oration at the
New York Tabernacle	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	, '' The Fortune of the Republic '' in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1863	DATE	, and the address at the
Burns Cen	ORGANIZATION	- tenary dinner , described by
Lowell	PERSON	with unwonted enthusiasm as he recalled the magnetism of the speaker , -- '' like an electric spark , thrilling as it went , and then exploding in a thunder of plaudits . ''

		After
Emerson	PERSON	had chosen the Lyceum as his im - mediate field , his first themes were semi-scientific , dealing with fundamentals , and yet seeking to inculcate spiritual ideas into technical subjects , as in the lecture on Water , at the
Boston Mechanics Institute	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1834 -RRB- , or the contemporaneous addresses before the
Society of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Popular lect - ures on scientific themes were remunerative at that time .

		He wrote
Carlyle	PERSON	of the large sums paid , --
$ 3000	MONEY	to Dr.
Spurzheim	PERSON	for a course of Phrenology , and a larger sum to Professor
Silliman	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	for fifteen lectures on Geology .

		Emerson soon realized two facts , -- first , that he was unfitted for treating scientific subjects ; and second , that such ventures , though temporarily enriching , were `` attended by a degree of uncertainty . ''

		With more zeal , he prepared his first course of biographical lectures on
Michael Angelo	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	, Luther ,
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, and
Burke	PERSON	.

		The first two appeared later in the '' North Amer - ican Review , '' but their author did not care to preserve them , as he did the later series of
1845	DATE	.

		After desultory addresses on educational and historic themes ,
Emerson	PERSON	arranged , in
November 1835	DATE	, for a course of lectures on English Literature , at
Masonic Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, before the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge	ORGANIZATION	.

		These themes , 80 well analyzed in the Appendix to Mr.
Cabot	PERSON	's Memoir , satisfied
Emerson	PERSON	that this form of lecture offered the best scope for bis poetic and ethical sug - gestions .

		The enthusiasm of his audience , increas - ing as the lectures continued , gave him greater confidence .

		While at times he chafed under the exactions of time , place , and the whims of a pro- miscuous audience , and craved respite from the fatigues of journeying , yet his attitude was quite unlike that of
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		The latter confessed his rebellion at the '' bayonets of Necessity '' which drove him into the lecture-room where his over - wrought nerves threatened `` a flood of tears and blubbering . ''

		Emerson , on the other hand , ac - knowledged to his friend '' a certain delight -LRB- base also ? -RRB-

		in speaking to a multitude . ''

		But he found joy in the friends , -- `` those sacred people '' who were largely gathered through this means .

		Whatever
Emerson	PERSON	's theme might be , in the earlier studies of great men or the later thoughts on life 's abstractions -- Culture , Character ,
Exper	PERSON	- ience , Self -
Reliance	ORGANIZATION	, -- he was uniformly popular and stimulating .

		His melodious voice and natural ease of manner gained for him his first hold upon his audience ; his intellectual and moral earnestness tended to cement the kindly relationship thus estab - lished .

		One who recalls the charm of his lectures has told me that his characteristic expression has been well caught by
David Scott	PERSON	in his famous painting , -- the benign , penetrating eye , with its hazy depths , and the easy poise of the body , with one hand extended and loosely closed .

		Ac - cording to Mr.
Alexander Ireland	PERSON	, the English auditors of
Emerson	LOCATION	, long expectant of his coming , were entranced by his winning personality .

		The first impression was of '' a manner so singularly quiet and unimpassioned that you began to fear the beauty and force of his thoughts were about to be marred by what might be described as monotony of expression .

		But very soon this apprehension dispelled .

		The mingled dignity , sweetness and strength of his features , the earnestness of his man - ner and voice , and the evident depth and sincerity of his convictions , gradually extorted your deepest attention , and made you feel that you were within the grip of no ordinary man , but of one ' sprung of earth 's first blood , ' with ' titles manifold . ' ''

		With
1903	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL .

		329 mannscript by his side ,
Emerson	PERSON	wag yet so conver - sant with his caref ally studied thenae and diction that he was able to speak into the eyes as well as the ears of his aadienee .

		A contemporary joamal said : ' * He has a horror of extempore speaking , ... and a farther horror of reporters , who seize and slanghter his fresh atterances . ''

		There was , however , more than grace of manner to gain for Emerson the epithet of
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		* ' the most steadily attractive lecturer in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The mental and moral strength of thoaght were illo - mined by a literary form which was all his own .

		The mingling of serenity and fearless force are readily noted in his best addresses .

		Aa an example , let ns ` ecall the poetic tenderness , changing to swift challenge , in the opening paragraphs of the
Divinity School Address	ORGANIZATION	: ' * In this refulgent
summer	DATE	, it has been a luxury to draw the breath of life .

		The grass grows , the buds burst , the meadow is spotted with fire and gold in the tint of flowers .

		The air is full of birds and sweet with the breath of the pine , the balm of
Gilead	ORGANIZATION	, and the new hay ... Whenever the pulpit is usurped by a formalist , then is the worshipper degraded and disconsolate .

		We shrink as soon as the prayers begin , which do not uplift , but smite and offend as . ''

		* Nearly twenty years ago the writer of these lines was one of a great crowd gathered in the hall of the
Nataral History Museum	ORGANIZATION	in Lon - don , to witness the unveiling of the statne of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Conspicuous among those who took part in the ceremony were Professor Huxley , the
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, and the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	-- now
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a worldly sense , the man who was once so reviled had completely triumphed ; but Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	touched a deeper chord when be declared that the statue was not placed there merely to perpetuate
Darwin	PERSON	's memory , -- that ran no risk of obli - vion ; neither was it to indicate the official sanction of the authorities , -- for science recog - nised no such sanction . ''

		No , '' he said , '' we beg you to cherish this memorial as a symbol by which , as generation after generation of students enter yonder door , they shall be re - minded of the ideal according to which they must shape their lives , if they would turn to best account the opportunities offered by the great institution under your charge . ''

		No words could be more fitting , and it is with exactly the same feeling that we finish the reading of the volumes now under review .

		We are not concerned now to praise
Darwin	PERSON	's intellect ; we are not concerned to defend his theory ; we think only with reverence and affection of the man who lived the life we would fain live ; who showed us , in the midst of a trivial world , what our kind is capable of .

		When such men are possible , it is worth while to be a human being !

		It is a Darwinian principle that when in a variable species some individuals are better fitted than others to live and propagate , these will increase and gradually supplant those less suited to the environment .

		Thus what was ex - ceptional , once having come into existence , mav become normal .

		330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, the best shall come to their own .

		If all that is noble in the human species is permitted to de - velop , and worth is the only cause of wealth , not only will the race be much bettered for the time being , but on good Darwinian principles , it will advance .

		Here is our opportunity : how are we using it ?

		These remarks are suggested by the ob - vious reflection that but for the possession of inherited wealth ,
Darwin	PERSON	would have been practically lost to the world .

		His continual ill-health would have made it difficult for him to have earned any sort of a living , and out of the question to do in addition any scientific work .

		For twenty years he studied evolution , before he was willing to publish ; and all this while he would have been considered to be wasting his time , according to the opinion of the day .

		His books were eventually a source of revenue , but for many years his conduct was exactly the reverse of that necessary for `` getting on . ''

		That one of the greatest men the world has ever produced was not utterly crushed and annihilated , is seen to be the re - sult of what may fairly be termed an accident .

		With the most favorable conditions , we can not expect to produce many like
Darwin	PERSON	; but it is to be feared that we are criminally blind and extravagantly wasteful .

		Some idea of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's continual ill-health may be gathered from frequent passages in the letters ; for example : '' My health is better than it was a few years ago , but I never pass a day without much discomfort and the sense of • xtreme fatigue '' -LRB- letter 286 ; 1878 -RRB- . ''

		My health is considerably improved , so that I am able to work nearly two hours a day '' -LRB- letter 363 ; 1866 -RRB- .

		One could not help marvelling at the thought of what
Darwin	PERSON	would have done if he had enjoyed robust health ; but then the question arose , how could a man have done more than he did ?

		Upon closer consideration , I believe that in a certain sense
Darwin	PERSON	's great power was partly the result of his ill-health , which so greatly re - duced his power of doing active work .

		Though he may nominally have worked only a few hours each day , at other times his mind was not idle , and he had ample time for reflection .

		From what we now know of the human mind , it is im - possible to doubt that even his moments of idle - ness and mere musing were often moments of illumination .

		I believe we destroy as much talent by submerging it in the details of active work , as by neglecting its existence .

		Darwin 's ideas upon education are of much interest to us .

		Of course a passage in a letter must not always be regarded as expressing a settled opinion , but the following sentences are at least significant : '' I am one of the root and branch men , and would leave classics to be learnt by those alone who have suf - ficient zeal and the high taste requisite for their appre - ciation .

		... I was at school at
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	under a great scholar , Dr.
Butler	PERSON	; I learnt absolutely nothing , except by amusing myself by reading and experimenting in chemistry .

		Dr.
Butler	PERSON	somehow found this out , and publicly sneered at me before the whole school for such gross waste of time '' -LRB- letter 774 ; 1867 -RRB- . ''

		I really think you can not go on better , for edu - cational purposes , than you are now doing -- observing , thinking and some reading beat , in ray opinion , all sys - tematic education '' -LRB- letter 646 , to
J. Scott	PERSON	,
1863	DATE	-RRB- .

		Closely connected with this topic are his views on English style , and the letter just quoted continues : '' Do not despair about your style .

		... I never stndy style ; all that I do is to try to get the subject as clear as I can in my own bead , and express it in the commonest language which occurs to me .

		But I generally have to think a good deal before the simplest arrangement and words occur to me . ''

		Again -LRB- letter 151 ; 1862 -RRB- : '' It is a golden rule always to use , if possible , a short old
Saxon	PERSON	word .

		Such a sentence as ' so purely dependent is the incipient plant on the specific morpho - logical tendency ' does not sound to my ears like good mother English -- it wants translating . ''

		It seems remarkable to us , who readily ac - cept the familiar idea of evolution , that when the '' Origin of Species '' appeared , so many talented and competent men should have been unable to see its value .

		Darwin came fully to realize the difficulty of changing the trend of a well-occupied mind ; in a letter to
Wallace	PERSON	-LRB- letter 442 -RRB- concerning a difference of opinion about protective resemblances he writes : '' But we shall never convince each other .

		I some - times marvel how truth progresses , so difficult is it for one man to convince another , unless bis mind is vacant .

		Nevertheless , I myself to a certain extent contradict my own remarks , for I believe far more in the impor - tance of protection than I did before reading your articles . ''

		Writing to
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	-LRB- letter 498 -RRB- he says : '' I do hope that you will re-urge your views about the reappearance of old characters , for , as far as I can judge , the most important views are often neglected unless they are urged and re-urged . ''

		No one was less '' cock sure '' than
Darwin	PERSON	, though he could nearly always give good rea - sons for his opinions , and would not give them up unless convinced by better ones .

		He writes to
Wallace	PERSON	in
1868	DATE	: '' I grieve to differ from you , and it actually terrifies me and makes me constantly distrust myself '' -LRB- letter 449 -RRB- .

		He
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		331 had learned by hard experience the difficulty of being accurate : he writes to
J. Scott	PERSON	-LRB- a gar - dener who was in a certain sense his pupil -RRB- : ''
Accaraey	PERSON	is the soul of
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is hard to become accurate ; he who modifies a hair 's breadth will never be accurate .

		It is a golden rule , which I try to follow , to put every fact which is opposed to one 's preconceived opinion in the strongest light .

		Absolute accuracy is the hardest merit to attain , and the highest merit .

		Any deviation is ruin '' -LRB- letter 647 -RRB- .

		The letters , like those in the earlier '' Life and Letters , '' reveal throughout the charming relations between
Darwin	PERSON	and his friends , and his unfailing courtesy to all .

		Often there is a playful sally thinly covering a deep and tender feeling , as in a letter to
Hooker	PERSON	-LRB- letter 612 -RRB- : ■ * Your letter is a mine of wealth , but first I most scold yen : I can not abide to hear you abuse yourself , even in joke , and call yourself a stupid dog .

		You , in fact , thus abuse me , because for long years I have looked up to you as the man whose opinion I have valued more on any scientific subject than any one else in the world .

		I continually marvel at what yon know , and at what you do . ''

		Again to
Hooker	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	-LRB- letter 764 -RRB- : '' I can not but think that you are too kind and civil to visitors , and too conscientious about your official work .

		But a man can not care his virtues , any more than his vices , after early youth ; so you must bear your bur - then .

		It is , however , a great misfortune for science that you hare so very little spare time for the Genera -LSB- Plantamm -RSB- . ''

		Writing to Huxley in
1868	DATE	-LRB- letter 208 -RRB- ke says : '' I never received a note from you in my life with - ont pleasure ; but whether this wiil be so after you have read pangenesis , I am very doubtful .

		Oh Lord , what a blowing up I may receive !

		I write now partly to say that you must not think of looking at my book till the
summer	DATE	, when I hope you will read pangenesis , for I care for your opinion on such a subject more than for that of any other man in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		You are so terribly sharp-sighted and so confoundedly honest ! ''

		Darwin 's family life was almost ideal ; he had the happiness of seeing most of his chil - dren grow up and occupy useful places in the world , two of them --
Francis	PERSON	and
George	PERSON	-- attaining eminence in science .

		It is not wonder - ful that talent should have appeared among the
Darwin	PERSON	children , for their mother was a Wedg - wood , and here was a combination of superior blood quite fulfilling Mr.
Galton	PERSON	's ideal .

		We are given an excellent portrait of Mis .

		Darwin , and the following passage from
Darwin	PERSON	's auto - biography is printed for the first time : '' You all know your mother , and what a good mother she has ever been to all of you .

		She has been my great - est blessing , and I can declare that in my whole life I have never heard her utter one word I would rather have been unsaid .

		She has never failed in kindest sympathy towards me , and has borne with the ntmost patience my frequent complaints of ill-health or dis - comfort .

		I do not believe she has ever missed an oppop - tnnity of doing a kind action to any one near her .

		I marvel at my good fortune that she , so infinitely my superior in every single moral quality , consented to be my wife .

		She has been my wise adviser and cheerful comforter throughout life , which without her would have been during a very long period a miserable one from ill-health .

		She has earned the love of every sonl near her '' -LRB- vol .

		1 , p. 30 -RRB- .

		His old age was cheered by the arrival of a grandchild , of whom he writes -LRB- letter 754 -RRB- : '' We all in this house humbly adore our grand - child , and think his little pimple of a nose quite beautiful . ''

		It must be another grandchild whose intelligence is compared with that of a monkey .

		It appears that the monkey '' was very fond of looking through her -LSB- Lady Hob - house 's -RSB- eyeglass at objects , and moved the glass nearer and further so as to vary the focus .

		This struck me , as
Frank	PERSON	's son , nearly two years old -LRB- and we think much of his intellect !! -RRB-

		is very fond of looking through my pocket lens , and I have quite in vain endeavoured to teach him not to put the glass close down on the object , but he always wUl do so .

		Therefore I conclude that a child under two years is inferior in intellect to a monkey '' -LRB- letter 417 -RRB- .

		Most of the letters deal with concrete things , but here and there we find a bit of philosoph - ical suggestion or speculation .

		The following written to
Hooker	PERSON	is interesting : '' I quite agree how humiliating the slow progress of man is , but every one has his own pet horror , and this slow progress or even personal annihilation sinks in my mind into insignificance compared with the idea or rather I presume certainty of the sun some day cooling and we aill freezing .

		To think of the progress of mil - lions of years , with every continent swarming with good and enlightened men , all ending in this , and with prob - ably no fresh start until this our planetary system has been again converted into red-hot gas .

		Sic transit gloria mundi , with a vengeance '' -LRB- letter 185 -RRB- .

		However , at the rate at which mammalia ap - pear to change , when this happens Homo sapiens will presumably have either died out or changed into an entirely different genos , not to say species !

		I suppose this is about as certain as the other event , and it is a little hard to feel that superior beings may arise who will think of us as we regard our long-past mam - malian ancestors , -- beings so different from ourselves that if we could see them we should only regard them with fear and hatred .

		Con - siderations such as these constitute a strong argument for human immortality in spiritual form , not because they afford the least particle of proof , but because they arouse in us a feeling that immortality is necessary .

		Darwin seems not quite to have felt this , for he writes : `` Many persons seem to make themselves quite easy 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, about immortality , and the existence of a per - sonal God , by intuition ; and I suppose that I must differ from such persons , for I do not feel any innate conviction on any such points '' -LRB- letter 571 ; 1874 -RRB- .

		However , '' if we con - sider the whole universe , the mind refuses to look at it as the outcome of chance -- that is , without design or purpose '' -LRB- letter 307 ; 1881 -RRB- .

		There are many more passages one is tempted to quote , but the above will suffice to show the absorbing interest of the book .

		Of course there is a great deal in the letters that is technical , and it is not to be supposed that non-scientific persons will read the whole of them .

		I think it is a little to be regretted that so much of the quarrel with Professor
Owen	PERSON	is allowed to appear ; one does not in the least doubt that
Owen	PERSON	behaved badly , but that is now long ago , and probably
Darwin	PERSON	himself would have been unwilling to bring again to light the fail - ings of the old anatomist .

		The editorial work has been admirably done ; the footnotes sup - plied by the editors include brief biographical notices of the principal persons mentioned in the letters .

		I notice only two trifling editorial mistakes ; in vol .

		1 , p. 331 ,
Campodea	LOCATION	is said to be a beetle , whereas it is a thysanuran ; in vol .

		2 , p. 67 , the name of the red-underwing moth is given incorrectly .

		The illustrations are quite numerous , all portraits ; the photogravures are extremely good , especially that representing
Darwin	PERSON	as a boy , with his sister
Catherine	PERSON	.

		There is a very complete index .

		French Engravehs of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In '' French Engravers and
Draughtsmen	PERSON	of the XVlIIth Century , '' Lady Dilke brings to an end the series in which she has presented the leading features of French Art in that rather barren period .

		The eighteenth century was not marked by great achievement in the graphic arts , except in
Japan	LOCATION	, where the inven - tion and development of chromo-xylography led to the production of the marvellously beau - tiful color prints , from engraved blocks , which are at once the delight and the despair of those who seek to rival the attainments in this direc - tion by the masters of the Ukiyo-ye school .

		transition .

		The art of its earlier years was a survival of the great movements of the pre - ceding century , a persistence of ideas whose initial force had been spent .

		Intellectual in - spiration declined ; technical skill remained to be exercised on more and more unworthy sub - jects , until it , too , gradually sank under the influences by which the artists of the day were surrounded .

		Toward the
end of the century	DATE	there was an awakening , but the movements then inaugurated did not culminate until the first decades of the succeeding century , to which , therefore , they may more properly be said to belong .

		In
France	LOCATION	it was in many ways an age of dilletanteism .

		The master works wrought by the great engravers ,
Edelinck	PERSON	,
Nanteuil	PERSON	, and
Gerard Audran	PERSON	, in the days of the '' Grand Monarque , '' and of their successors ,
Pierre Drevet	PERSON	and his even more highly gifted son
Pierre-Imbert Drevet	PERSON	, awakened such wide - spread interest in the art of engraving on cop - per that it became a fashionable fad .


Cochin	LOCATION	had for a pupil no less a personage than
Madame de Pompadour	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the long list of amateur engravers of the period we find such names as the Princess de
Conde	LOCATION	; the
Marquis	PERSON	d'Argenson ; the
Dukes of Chevreuse	ORGANIZATION	, of
Charost	LOCATION	, and of Chaulnes ; the
Chevalier de Valory	ORGANIZATION	; the
Marquis	PERSON	d'Harcourt ; the Count d'Eu ;
Bertinazzi	PERSON	dit
Carlin	PERSON	, the famous actor ; and even that of
Philippe Egalite	LOCATION	himself .

		Some of these left a considerable amount of work , but for the most part they shed more lustre on the art thi-ough their social prestige than by their skill with the burin .

		Other amateurs there were among people of wealth and fashion , whose work by its respectable quality places them in another and a higher class .

		Among these , the
Comte de Caylus	ORGANIZATION	and
Claude-Henri Watelet	PERSON	are the most noted .

		The title of the latter to distinction rests , however , quite as much upon his remarkable attachment to
Madame Le Comte	ORGANIZATION	, their life together at Le Moulin-Joli , and their famous journey to
Italy	LOCATION	in
1763	DATE	, as upon the three hundred plates that he engraved or etched .

		The tie that bound these people together was their common love for art ; Lady Dilke quotes from Mme.
Viges Lebrun	PERSON	's `` Memoirs '' the following reference to it : `` A friend , to whom he had been attached for thirty years , lived in his house .

		Time had sanctified , so to say , their tie to such a point that they were everywhere re - ceived in the best company , as well as the lady 's husband , who , drolly enough , never left her . ''


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 333 The place filled by the
Comte de Caylus	ORGANIZATION	waa aniqae .

		To his contemporaries he was always '' ce connoissear profond , '' and he exercised ex - traordinary influence over every branch of art , and especially over that of engraving , to which his devotion was unwearied .

		With
Pierre	PERSON	-
Jean Mariette	PERSON	, the famous print-seller , collec - tor , and publisher , he formed a close friendship , and together -- to quote Lady Dilke 's words -- they '' exercised an authority with which , as long as they lived , every dealer , draughtsman and engraver had to reckon ... Each found in the other qualities in which he himself was more or less lacking .

		The varied acquirements of de Caylus , his tendency to dogmatic system and theoretic speculation , were a stimulus to the intelligence of
Mariette	PERSON	, who , inheriting narrower traditions and special training , was inclined toward the exhibition of pure connois - seurship , backed , it is true , by an amazing store of exact learning .

		The influence which they combined to exercise on their contemporaries was of incalculable importance . ''

		That this influence was stimulating , there can be no doubt .

		At the same time , by its narrow - ing tendency it helped to make the sarrounJing conditions unfavorable to the awakening of true artistic impulse , and thus it became a potent factor in a period of decadence .

		The weakness of the position taken by
Mariette	PERSON	and de Caylus is pertinently stated by Lady Dilke . ''

		It led , '' she says , ' • to a doctrinaire assumption of the merit of all work -- no matter how poor in quality -- executed according to certain canons of taste ; and to the condemnation of all -- no matter how graceful and brilliant -- in which these canons were not respected . ''

		With the death of the younger
Drevet	PERSON	, in
1789	DATE	, what has been called the golden age of portrait-engraving in
France	LOCATION	came to an end .


Cochin	LOCATION	,
Daulle	LOCATION	, and other engravers of dis - tinction , remained ; but their work does not , on the whole , entitle them to be included among those of the front rank .

		And although in the latter part of the century there was a great in - crease in the number of engravers , a special class of whom worked upon illustrations for books , there were but few stars of the first mag - nitude .

		Of these ,
Jean George Wille	PERSON	was the most eminent , and attained such extraordinary vogue that the subsequent history of line - engraving in
Europe	LOCATION	is little more than an ac - count of what was accomplished by him and his pupils .

		Lady
Dilke	PERSON	has not adopted the historical method in the treatment of her subject , bat gives , instead , a series of connected essays upon the more important men .

		Her pages are filled with pleasant discourse and anecdotes , and a good deal of information in given , chiefly biographical .

		There is no attempt at a com - prehensive survey of the art of engraving and its relation to other branches of the art of the period .

		Such a survey would not only have added much to the value of the book , but would have made it more readable , and given it the co - herence which it now lacks .

		Of criticism there is very little .

		Such comment upon particular works as is given is rather in a vein of indis - criminate praise , with which it is not possible always to agree .

		It is difficult , for example , to share the author 's estimate of
Choffard	ORGANIZATION	's de - signs , or to accept the adjective '' miraculously pretty '' as applied to
Cochin	LOCATION	's ticket of ad - mission to the '' Bal Pare , porte et gradins a gauche . ''

		These , however , are but minor blem - ishes in a book which is a conscientious attempt to give in entertaining form a view of the engravers of the eighteenth century and of the conditions under which their work was per - formed .

		The illustrations consist of fifty full-page reproductions of engravings and drawings .

May 16	DATE	, preciation of the importance of this campaign against mal-administration , but shows that the '' business man '' was himself to blame for many of these perversions of city government , and still more for the narrow range of municipal activity .

		Municipal government is not '' busi - ness , '' -- it is a profession , and a most exacting one .

		A class of professional office-holders is inevitable , and even a necessity .

		We have , then , to determine whether it shall be the cor - rupt class that now holds in most of our large cities -- except during the spasms of reform , -- or a class of specially trained experts .

		Pro- fessor Ely demands the recognition of the university-trained expert as the natural agent of municipal government .

		Professor
Zueblin	PERSON	's book is a remarkable summary and judgment of the attainments and prospects of our American cities . ''

		Chapters in Municipal Sociology '' is the sub-title .

		Mu - nicipal Sociology being defined as the science that `` investigates the means of satisfying com - munal wants through public activity . ''

		Trans - portation , Public Works , Sanitation ,
Public Recreation	ORGANIZATION	, are topics that appear among the chapter-headings .

		One is surprised at the omis - sion of Police and Charities , but the author pre - fers to leave some topics for political science .

		It is not , however , that something has been omitted , but rather that so much has been covered , that most impresses the reviewer .

		Upon most of the topics , descriptive studies and statistics have been abundant of late .

		But what has been lacking is some balanced judg - ment of the relative value of the attainments of different cities .

		Each has been accustomed to seize upon some data that appear creditable to itself , and to ascribe all criticism purely to envy .

		To consider simply one subject -- Parks , -- the author goes back of the crude statistics of area and population to consider the distribu - tion of parks , the small park , the playground , street area , vacant-lot area , private parks , woods near the city , and various other matters bearing directly upon the heart of the question .

		And it is not simply the large city , but cities great and small , and of every section of the country --
Savannah	LOCATION	and
Los Angeles	LOCATION	and South Bend , as well as
Boston	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Zueblin	PERSON	speaks with the authority of a more detailed acquaintance with American civic conditions than is possessed by almost any other man .

		His judgment is sane , yet at times his criticism is so sharp as to make the book stimulating as well as instructive .

		Through both of these books runs the spirit of the newer civic movement , -- something that is like a revival of the ancient civic religions : the passion to make our cities such that we may glory in them as the fullest expressions of our highest life .

		`` The various memoirs of Professor Miiller 's life have by no means made the present intel - ligent and tasteful work a repetition , and we find here , in gratifying continuity , the whole story of this serene career , the only noticeable inaccuracy lying in the occasional confusion of proper names and foreign phrases .

Lowell	LOCATION	: rich in his endowment of winsome charm , '' loving his fellow creatures and loved by them , '' as he presents his own ideal to a young namesake .

		He may even be called the Last of the Romanticists , inheriting directly the in - nermost traditions of
Jena	LOCATION	and
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Deutsche Liebe '' -LRB- better known under the title of the American version , '' Memories '' -RRB- is the most personally typical of his writings , and was regarded by him with an especial af - fection .

		No little opposition to
Max Miiller	PERSON	came from stolid worshippers of fact who had never learned that truth is raised to potency only when touched by the imagination . ''

		I admire those who try to purify the Thames , '' he wrote , '' but I have no shoulders for that kind of work .

		My favourites of course are the German Mystics , particularly Master Eckart and Cardinal Cusanus '' ; his life-story strengthens our conviction that the values of life can not be realized save by those who are '' Refreshed from kegs not coopered in this our world . ''

		Miiller 's brilliant scholastic training in - volved two chief factors , poverty and pluck , both in unstinted measure .

		A rigorous clas - sical education in the Leipsic Gymnasium sweetened his whole life with the Attic charm .

		At
the University of Leipsic	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1841-1844 -RRB- his interest was drawn to Sanskrit by Professor

		THE DIAIi 335 manifest in these younger days , in which a chivalrous devotion to his widowed mother foreshadowed that high-minded loyalty to all natural ties which so dignified his entire life .

		When but nineteen years old he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy ; in
March , 1844	DATE	, he brought out a translation of the
Hitopadeca	LOCATION	, and betook himself to
Berlin	LOCATION	to carry out studies in
Sanskrit	LOCATION	and philosophy .

		In
Berlin	LOCATION	he reconciles the straitest private surroundings with social prestige in the best intellectual circles of the capital .

		From his ill-appointed garret he writes , '' I can not give up Sanskrit , though it holds out no prospect for me , '' nor did he , even when the waters rose most threateningly .

		Toward the end of No - vember , 1 ^ 44 , came an invitation from a
Baron Hagedorn	PERSON	of
Dessau	LOCATION	-LRB- a type of that convenient deus ex machina for which European society contrives to have room -RRB- , to stay at his house in
Paris	LOCATION	while working at
Sanskrit	LOCATION	.

		To
Paris	LOCATION	he accordingly goes , and , although his deus ex macfiina leaves him very much in the lurch , he in some unexplained way contrives to keep soul and body together while -LRB- through Bar - nonf 's influence -RRB- he attacks with supreme en - thusiasm his life-work , the preparation of a monumental edition of the Rig Veda with
Sayana	ORGANIZATION	's commentary , -- a task involving the mastery of the whole illustrative literature from appalling masses of corrupt Indian man - nscripts . ''

		If I had to wait ten years , '' he said -LRB- somewhat later -RRB- , ' * I would not translate a single line till the whole Vedic antiquity with its wealth of thought lay clearly before me . ''

		In addition to the enormous work in - volved , there loomed up the disheartening fact that no publisher could be induced to under - take the printing . ''

		Life is difficult , and why ? ''

		he discourses to his mother : `` because of that cursed money , which so many throw away , which makes thousands miserable , and very few happy . ''

		The day began to break , however , in
1846	DATE	, when Miiller went to
London	LOCATION	to spend three weeks ; -- it turned out a resi - dence in
England	LOCATION	of more than fifty-four years .

		In
April , 1847	DATE	,
Miiller	PERSON	wrote to his mother : '' All tnT time , moner , and work , indeed mr whole life perhaps , woald hare been sacrificed and lost , had not
Bonsen	PERSON	, who bad once been in the same position , with - out my saying anything to him , stood by me , and in this way made it possible for me to straggle on with joyful confidence and firm faith towards the goal I had set before me . ''

		It would be an attractive digression to pay a tribute to
Baron Bunsen	PERSON	-LRB- surely he must be the original of that lovable ambassador in Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's '' Eleanor '' ! -RRB-

		, described by his young protege as one who is '' always cheerful , and studies Egyptian and Chinese to drive politics out of his head '' ; '' the sort of diplomatist they all should be , a true man , simple and good , desiring and striving for what is right , and leaving the rest to providence .

		For this the wise
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	pronounces him to be no diplo - matist . ''

		Bunsen was at all times keenly on the lookont for handicapped talents , and smooth - ing the path before them with equal delicacy and generosity .

		It was he who persuaded the reluctant
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	of the
East India Compaay	LOCATION	, all strictly practical men , to under - take the editing and publishing of the
Rig Veda	LOCATION	; Miiller was promised
# 200	MONEY	a year on a contract which involved about eight years ' time , and thus his complete financial inde - pendence was assured .

		In
1848	DATE	he settled in
Oxford	LOCATION	, from which time his influence extended rapidly and steadily .

		His fineness of mind and charact `` r made a distinct impression upon the best English society , and he had the tact and good sense to adjust himself to whatever dif - ferences arose , aesthetic or social . ''

		When
Beethoven 's Septette	ORGANIZATION	was played as a finale , they mostly went away ; perfect barbarians !

		And yet they are good honest people , with whom it is easy to live when one understands them . ''

		His Oxford lectures in the little known field of comparative philology immediately at - tracted wide interest .

		He was made an hon - orary Master of Arts , member of
Christ Church College	ORGANIZATION	, and Deputy Professor of Modern Lan - guages , bringing a vivacity and breadth into his lectures which were without precedent .

		In
1859	DATE	he married
Georgina Grenfell	PERSON	, a niece of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	; her sterling qualities sup - plemented most effectively his admirable gifts , and this partnership founded one of the hap - piest of all English homes , a centre of far - reaching influence which drew to itself the choicest spirits from near and far .

		It is hardly necessary to detail the further progress of labors which were particularly successful in gaining the attention of the public for studies of which it had never suspected the existence .

		The
Rig Veda	LOCATION	was completed after more than twenty-five years ' work , and achieved the high ideal of its editor by dispersing the accretions with which milleniums of superstition had en - crusted it .

		The later years of life were devot `` d chiefly to the comparative study of religions , a work which was reflect `` d in the Parliament of Religions in
Chicago	LOCATION	-LRB- 1893 -RRB- -- regarded by
Max Miiller	PERSON	as the most significant event of 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, the nineteenth century , -- and which shows as its imposing monument the stately row of versions of the '' Sacred Books of the East . ''

		About a year before his death , which occurred on
October 28 , 1900	DATE	, he contemplated passing from the stage , in a spirit fully consistent with his true and simple life . ''

		What is more natural in life than death ?

		and hav - ing lived this long life , so full of light , having been led so kindly by a fatherly hand through all storms and struggles , why should I be afraid when I have to make the last step ?

		I have finished nearly all my work , and what is more , I see that it will be carried on by others , by stronger and younger men .

		I have never piped much in the market , I gladly left that to others , but I have laid a foundation that will last , and though people do n't see the blocks buried in a river , it is on those unseen blocks the bridges rest . ''

		Miiller 's position in
England	LOCATION	was somewhat invidious , for his residence there fell precisely at the time when the person of the Prince Con - sort had served to arouse a jealous and un - reasonable dread of all German influence .

		On this account there were repeated instances of the withholding of public recognition which had been freely bestowed upon the eminent scholar from all sources outside the British isles .

		Miiller 's sweet spirit was not perturbed , and he remained a discriminating student and admirer of British politics . ''

		Though
John Bull	PERSON	does make a fool of himself now and then , '' he wrote , '' the world would soon go to wrack and ruin without him . ''

		His statesmanlike grasp of world-politics exerted a powerful influence in the stormy days of
1870	DATE	and
1871	DATE	by rea - son of very intimate relations with
Gladstone	PERSON	, as well as through his communications with
Bismarck	PERSON	; in all these expressions he acted as the ardent friend of
Germany	LOCATION	, at a time when the whole weight of British sympathy was being forced toward the French side . ''

		The whole future of the world seems to me to de - pend on the friendship of the three Teutonic nations ,
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	'' ; this sentence shows the temper in which he worked incessantly , both in public and private , -- in much the same spirit as that with which Mr.
Motley	PERSON	labored to sway the inert English opinion toward the
National	ORGANIZATION	cause during our civil war .

		His last days were ennobled by his opposition to the abusive hostility of
Germany	LOCATION	toward
England	LOCATION	at the time of the Boer con - flict .

		The blind frenzy of
Germany	LOCATION	at this time was especially hard to combat : even the distinguished
Deutsche Rundschau	ORGANIZATION	, his long - standing intimate medium of communication with his fellow-Germans , dared not print his courteous and tactful presentation of the En - glish side .

		Gentleness and kindness radiated from him by natural laws .

		There was a childlike sim - plicity , joined to a delightfully magisterial air , a sweet and refined countenance , and a schol - arly manner , which gave a total impression of the irresistible attractiveness of culture .

		His priceless gift of humor never failed him , nor an indomitable playful fun , '' which flowed like a purling brook , intertwining itself with con - versation , '' as
Canon Farrar	ORGANIZATION	records .

		He was a poet , dowered with highest lyric sensibility and responsiveness from boyhood , or , to speak more correctly , for a generation before he was born .

		Oxford was captivated by his mastery of the piano , and
John Stainer	PERSON	dedicated to him his work on Harmony .

		Miiller 's address led Bunsen to believe that he ought to have chosen a diplomatic career .

		The best abused man in the British Empire on the part of certain nar - row religionists , his unobstrusive faith shone like a star throughout his active life , and made his declining hours serene .

		His was that rare balance of harmonious qualities which pro- duces a rounded humanity , -- ' < I framed his tongue to music , I armed his hand with skill , I moulded his face to beauty , And his heart the throne of will . ''

		The controversy between
Max Miiller	PERSON	and Professor
Whitney	PERSON	, like
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's quarrel with Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	, is a painful subject to those who revere the memory of both contestants .

		Miiller , in his aversion to pedantry , purposely neglected all unnecessary cumbersome appa - ratus of scholarship , -- '' he sweeps cleanest that makes the least dust . ''

		His temperament had its very noticeable limitations : a free hand drawing is doubtless a truer portrait than a photograph , but clarity of outline is indispens - able in the exact sciences .

		A sheltered life , with merely local and congenial duties , had sundry unfortunate tendencies -- among them a well-bred insularity , * an inability to grasp certain unheard-of Titanic manifestations , and various harmless smaller vanities , a love of approbation and a keen personal satisfaction in well-earned gains , -- which were a part of his unusually sensitive and responsive nature .

		Whitney , on the other hand , was of far more rugged Puritan conscience as regards the se - vere responsibility of the scholar to facts , and to him Miiller 's graceful fancies were a debase - * Cf. '' The best people in
America	LOCATION	are ashamed of their president -LRB-

		THE DIAL 337 ment of the currency of scholarship , bringing confusion upon the '' grand ideals of careful - ness and the love of truth , '' -- as
Calvin Thomas	PERSON	briefly defines Science .

		If the first American scholar occasionally tended in the direction of formalism , it is certain that Miiller persistently clutched at theories of most nebulous tenuity .

		It must , however , be taken into account that in many cases the latter cheerfully recognized the provisional nature of his apercns .

		His fail - ure to estimate the vigor of
Whitney	LOCATION	's mind is to be deplored , nor is there lacking a hu - morously tragic irony in his apprehension lest the mind of his colossal adversary might be wavering .

		Sufficient to say that these con - trasting temperaments came into direct col - lision , although one can not but believe that , in essence , the divergent natures were designed to supplement and honor each other .

		While our intellect concedes the victory to
Antonio	LOCATION	, car heart can not keep from leaning toward Tasso .

		Quite another matter is the degrading ac - cusation of scholastic dishonesty which has been made against
Max Miiller	PERSON	, a charge which in its essence recalls the sordid reproaches which hastened to an embittered end the life of a man who was not only a naval hero , but one of the most high-minded and distinguished of all American public servants .

		In the case of Miiller , as of Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	, the matter turns upon the question whether an eminent authority , who has independently wrought out a plan of campaign and has put it into success - ful and vigorous operation , may intrust details , even very important details , to other competent hands without abdicating his position as re - sponsible head .

		In
1852	DATE	Dr.
Aufrecht	PERSON	, a capable scholar , was employed by Miiller to relieve him of much preliminary work in the further preparation of the text of the Rig Veda edition , a kind of work which is as depressing as sewing carpets .

		It was
Baron Bunsen	PERSON	who counselled and fully endorsed the arrangement thus entered into , which was quite as much a favor to the assistant as to the principal .

		In the Preface to the fifth volume of the Rig Veda Miiller puts the whole case frankly and honor - ably ; every trait in his character demands that we should accept this statement : '' There is not one doubtful or di # BcuU passage in the whole of this work where I have not myself carefully weighed the evidence of the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		; not one where I have not myself verified the exact readings of the MSS. , even in those portions which were copied and collated for me by others , except where the originals were out of my reach .

		... I take this opportunity of stating , once for all , that there is no page , no line , no word , no letter , no accent , in the whole of the Commentary for which I am not personally responsible .

		Nothing was ordered for press that I had not myself carefully examined and revised , and though for certain portions of my edition , as I stated in the Preface to each volume , I was relieved of much preliminary labour , the decision in all critical passages , whether for good or evil , always rested with me . ''

		`` Life is an art , and more difficult than Sanskrit or anything else , '' wrote
Max Miiller	PERSON	, almost at the beginning of his successful ca - reer ; certainly no man ever ordered his days more loyally in this spirit .

		There is in this singularly happy and harmonious record some - thing more than the charm which attaches to '' the scholar , beloved of earth and heaven , '' -- it is the promise of a higher and better hu - manity .

		To any gifted nature , isolated by force of surroundings from the larger and se - rener air to which it rightfully aspires , this book will prove a destroyer of prison walla , and will bring its reader into most intimate converse with choice spirits , making him part of a social cosmos perhaps as perfect as any yet achieved .

		The length and fulness of detail in the work only make this companionship more real and potent , and we should therefore be unwilling to abridge these large volumes by a single page .

Xew Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	.

		* No new edition of the essays of
Michel de Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	, noble , courtier , soldier , civil mag - nate , and master of affajrs , can fail to arouse interest in cultivated minds ; for the name of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	is not a mere literary name for critics to juggle with , -- it is a power , perhaps a grow - ing power , in the active world we live in .

		Mr ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	's edition , the work of an editor whose father 's name was for many years associated with the study of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	, has an especial claim upon the expectation of the reviewer .

		That expectation is not disappointed ; the edi - tion is in many respects the best which has yet been published in English .

		The revision of Cot - ton 's classic version is effected with the greatest possible conservatism , and the notes , including occasional transcripts from
Florio	PERSON	, are always illuminating .

		338 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, five letters by Montaigne which are extant , con - stitute a valuable supplement to the text .

		But , after all due credit is allowed for the apparatus of the edition , the main interest of the reader must focus upon the text itself .

		The lay reader , if he owes his introduction to Montaigne to old
Florio	PERSON	, may be grieved to learn that his text '' is grossly inaccurate and illiterate '' ; or , if Cotton has been his master , may be troubled by the occasional disturbance -LRB- in the interest of accuracy -RRB- of rhythms which long ago took up their dwelling-place in his memory , and now refuse to be dislodged .

		On the whole , however , it is a satisfaction to have matters set straight ; and there is no very good excuse at this day for one 's being satisfied to have Montaigne in any sort of translation at the expense of the original .

		There is no deny - ing that the present version often -- more often , perhaps , than that of
Florio	PERSON	-- misses the grace and ease of the French text .

		Perfect verbal accuracy in translating must always entail cer - tain sacrifices ; for the whole process of re - clothing a thought which has been expressed finally must be in the nature of a compromise .

		In this case , the work of the editor -- who had also to be translator -- has been done with greater success than might have been expected ; with only occasional awkwardnesses of manner , and with perfect fidelity to the meaning of the original .

		In order to secure a pure text , it was necessary for the editor not only to restore many passages omitted by Cotton , but to trans - fer various interpolations to the foot-notes .

		The task was rendered more embarrassing by the large number of emendations made by Montaigne in successive editions published during his life .

		The brief Preface contains an excellent , though very compact , estimate of the character and genius of Montaigne . ''

		He was , without being aware of it , the leader of a new school in letters and morals .

		His book stood apart from all others which were at that date in the world .

		It diverted the ancient currents of thought into new chan - nels .

		It told its readers with unexampled frankness what its writer 's opinion was about men and things , and threw what must have been a strange kind of new light on many matters but darkly understood .

		... Of all egotists ,
Montaigne	LOCATION	, if not the greatest , was the most fascinating , because , perhaps , he was the least affected and most truthful .

		What he did and what he had professed to do was to dissect his mind , and show us , as best he could , how it was made , and what relation it bore to external objects .

		He investigated his mental structure as a boy pulls his watch to pieces , to examine the mechanism of the works ; and the result , accom - panied by illustrations abounding in originality and force , he delivered to his fellow-men in a book -- one almost more replete with quotations from other writers than any extant : in matter and thought purely personal more exuberantly full . ''

		Montaigne really belongs , in a sense , with the great diarists and letter-writers , rather than with the great essayists .

		He wrote , like
Pepys	PERSON	or
Evelyn	PERSON	or
Miss Burney	PERSON	, for his own delight ; and though he deliberately published his work , it was with no real expectation of lasting fame .

		`` It is , at any rate , '' says Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	, `` scarcely probable that he foresaw how his renown was to become world-wide ; how he was to occupy an almost unique position as a man of letters and a moralist ; how the Essays would be read , in all the principal languages of
Europe	LOCATION	, by millions of intelligent human beings who never heard of
Perigord	ORGANIZATION	or the League , and who are in doubt , if they are questioned , whether the author lived in the sixteenth or the eighteenth century .

		This is true fame .

		A man of genius belongs to no period and no country .

		He speaks the language of nature , which is always everywhere the same . ''

		Some Darker Phases or the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The recently-published letters of
Earl Percy	PERSON	contain some very interesting items regarding the American Revolution , stated from the view - point of a British commander .

		For example , the letter to Governor
Gage	PERSON	which describes the retreat from
Lexington	LOCATION	ends with this sentence about His Majesty 's troops : '' Nor were they a little exasperated at the cruelty and barbarity of the Rebels , who scalped and cut off the ears of some of the wounded men who fell into their hands . ''

		Mr.
Sydney George Fisher	PERSON	, in his account of '' The True American Revolution , '' does not portray the

		THE DIAL 339 with great wigs that had once been white , some in their own hair , with every imaginable kind of hat or for cap , trailing every variety of old masket and shotg ^ un ; without order or discipline , joking with their leaders , talking , excited , welcoming to their ranks stadents from New Haven and clerks from country stores , they hurried from the bleak hills of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	and the sunny valleys of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, until within four or five days they had collected sixteen thousand strong at the little village of
Cambridgfe	LOCATION	, where they remained , half - starved , shivering in the cold nights without blankets . ''

		In such words Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	undertakes the dis - illusionizing process , -- to give the American reader a true account of the Bevolntion , to re - move the halo from the heads of the men of that war , and to show the harsher side of the struggle .

		Professor
Sumner	PERSON	, a few years ago , discussed some of the features of American public life before the Revolution , in four chap - ters of his ' • Life of
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
George Washington Greene	PERSON	, much earlier , introduced some of the same sort of discussion into his essays on the initial war of the
United States	LOCATION	; and other writers have set forth in their plain ugliness facts tending to show that there can not be an overturning of social conditions and a violent severing of political connections without some grating and grinding .

		Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	charges the historians with a failure to tell the whole truth , and a failare with a definite purpose .

		His main points are that the Revolution was not '' a great sponta - neous , unanimous uprising , all righteousness , perfection , and infallibility , a marvel of snooeas at every step , and incapable of failure , '' as many writers make out : that , instead of being cruel , tyrannical , and aggressive in its attitude toward the revolted colonies , the British gov - ernment was extremely lenient and conciliatory in its methods , at least up to
1778	DATE	, -- this the - ory being the only one under which
Howe	PERSON	's conduct can be understood ; and that the Loy - alists , or Tories , deserve far more consideration than they have ordinarily received from Amer - ican historians .

		While he discusses these main points , the author brings out a large number of smaller considerations , all combining to show ■ that the '' true American Revolution '' has not been well understood , and that the period was a much more ugly and unlovely one than we have usually been taught to believe .

		The book will have value as a corrective , and as a safe - guard against the tendency to over-emphasize the heroic aspects of our Revolution -- a tend - ency stimulated just now by the interest in patriotic hereditary societies and the increas - ing output of historical novels of the Revolu - tionary days .

		Mr.
Van Tyne	PERSON	's story of '' The Loyalists in the American Revolution '' is a concise study of what the author calls '' a tragedy but rarely paralleled in the history of the world . ''

		The expulsion of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	from
Spain	LOCATION	or the Huguenots from
France	LOCATION	might be used as an - alogies to some extent .

		The position of the Loyalists at the begmning of the struggle , their sufferings at the hands of the patriots , and their final banishment , are described with much detail of statement .

		The general impres - sion gained by the reader is that this element of our population was much sinned against .

		At the same time it is clearly shown that there was a great deal of striking back , and the con - viction is deepened that while many good peo - ple , who would have added strength to the new republic , were made to snffer very severely and were driven into exile , there were also many mean people , who were guilty of all sorts of detestable acts , and who therefore richly de - served all the punishment the patriots oonld give them .

		Mr.
Van Tyne	PERSON	's volume is a convenient hand - book regarding this phase of the Revolution .

		It is enriched with abundant footnotes and references to original sources .

		It has thirty pages of supplementary matter containing in abstract the principal measures taken by the several States against the Loyalists .

WiUiam Ellery Channing	ORGANIZATION	.

		The phrase well portrays the mission and inflaenee of his life , and forms a fitting sab-title for the Rev.
John W. Chadwick	PERSON	's new biography -LRB- Hooghton -RRB- .

		Tbe preface to Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	's volume saggests a note of comparison , inevitably recurring to the reader 's mind , between the lives of Channing and
Theodore Parker	PERSON	and the author 's treatment of each , -- `` as different as carving a statue from painting a picture , so much warmth and color were there in
Parker	PERSON	's experience and personality , so little in the older and greater man 's . ''

		From the • ' Memoir '' of
1848	DATE	, the volumes of sermons , and other soarces , the biographer has eonstracted a book which is never brilliant or dramatic , but is well condensed and interesting .

		Wisely , he purposed to emphasise '' the social rather than the theological '' in tracing Channing 's inflaenee upon American religions life .

		The paragraphs where his purpose lapsed are less sure in grasp and poise than the revelations of his subject 's mental and moral calibre .

		The develop - 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, mentof character is outlined in progressive chapters , from the picture of the impulsive and meditative child of early
Newport	LOCATION	days , to the active , often ascetic , preacher and social reformer of
Boston	LOCATION	and its historic
Federal Street Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The strong , hroad nature of the man are cited alike in the in - cidents of theological -- or Unitarian -- controversy , in his messages on anti-slavsry , and in his vital efforts for educational and moral reform .

		The closing words of the volume are well-choaen , -- the reiteration that Channing found '' the realization of his hopes far less in the spread of those particular opinions which received his intellectual assent than in the softening of sectarian animosities , the diminu - tion of sectarian zeal , the kinder mutual regards of different bodies of believers , the enlarging sympathy of the world 's great religions , and the labors of those men who are doing what they can to lessen party spirit , to improve social conditions , and to uphold , in spite of proud contempt and rancorous opposition , the things that make for peace . ''

		In effective contrast with the intense mental activities of Channing is the revelation of his domestic hap - piness , his delight in children and friends , and his restful pleasurable hours in his ''
Oakland	LOCATION	'' garden .

		The directness and force of Mr.
Chad wick	PERSON	's style is occasionally marred by discursive paragraphs , and by the intrusion of favorite but labored quotations ; as , for example , on page 79 , where , following a citation from
Channing	PERSON	's emphasis of daily duties as media for religious service , he writes : '' If
Channing	PERSON	had been one of the quoters , as he was not , and he had had
Keble	ORGANIZATION	's ' Christian Year ' at hand , which was not published till 1827 , he would certainly have quoted here , -- ` The trivial round , the common task , ' '' etc. .

		A more descriptive method , and less of analysis and argument , would have added effectiveness to the chapters dealing with
Channing	PERSON	's personality , in private and public incidents alike . ''

		To feast upon the treasures of the past is one of the rewards of loneli - ness . ''

		Thus soliloquizes ''
A. C. M.	PERSON	, '' as he blows a cloud of smoke from his briar-wood pipe and enters upon `` The Reflections of a Lonely Man '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The range of contents of this attractive little volume is less wide than one might have expected from the writer 's declaration that he has had '' experience of nearly everything that a man can read about in books , and of some things that a man can not read about . ''

		Mild satire , touched with humor , is the prevailing note .

		But the satirist occasionally betrays a forgetfulness of the fact that criticism is a two-edged sword , to be wielded with caution .

		College education and col - lege professors receive from him the patronizing , half-contemptuous treatment that argues not exactly the broadest and highest education in the speaker himself .

		The study of foreign languages to perfect one 's knowledge of English is held up to ridicule , and incidentally the writer betrays an imperfect Soliloquies humorous and satirical .

		command of French .

		The best utterances in the book are those on government and politicians .

		`` If we should have any time , '' says the author , illus - trating the futility of much that is classed under the head of government , '' to devote to politicians and their laws , we might spend it in weeping at the spectacle of a legislature trying , by laws of its own enactment , to prevent itself from accepting bribes . ''

		The following definitions are good : '' An agnostic is a man who believes nothing that he can not abso - lutely prove ; a practical man is one who believes anything that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt ; a hopeful man is one who believes anything that he can not disprove ; and an idealist is one who believes what he knows is not true . ''

		Christian Sci - ence , it is shrewdly observed , '' exploits a theory whereby not only medicine , but all other material things -- except money -- are entirely eliminated from the treatment of disease ... The Christian Scientists are clever as well as cheerful people ... and they have entertained some incurables and cured some people who were not sick , quite as well as any one else could have done it . ''

		In discussing '' The Search for Satisfaction , '' the author thinks that a man may find what he seeks in woman 's love , though he holds out little hope of its being a last - ing content . ''

		It is well , '' he says in conclusion , '' to think one 's own thoughts occasionally , even though they be wrong '' ; and he modestly and wisely admits the probability of error in his own musings .

Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- .

		These glimpses are given in a series of let - ters written by
Paterson	PERSON	to his college friends , and by random letters written to him .

		Among these friends are
John Macpherson	PERSON	, who fell in the assault of
Quebec	LOCATION	;
Luther Martin	PERSON	, of Anti-Federalist fame ; and
Aaron Burr	PERSON	, who was graduated from Prince - ton in the class of
1772	DATE	.

		With these letters are included some verses , chiefly in the style of Pope , intended for the
Cliosophic Society of Princeton College	ORGANIZATION	, and a few scraps of old-time college songs .

		Abounding in classic allusion , passing readily upon occasion into Latin , quoting from Swift ,
Pope	LOCATION	, Mo - lifere , and
Horace	PERSON	, the compositions of this young law student , recently graduated from
Princeton	LOCATION	, illustrate the aristocracy of letters in that day .

		Al - though covering the years important in the political revolution of the Colonies , there is scarcely a refer - ence to politics , or any prophecy of the public ca - reer so soon to be opened to this verbose essayist .

Princeton	LOCATION	in Colonial times .

		THE DIAL .

		341 Instead of soch slangy matter as woald fill the pages of a modern college student , there are alio - sions to nymphs , enchanting Peggies , adored Pat - ties , and fair Duleineas .

		The searcher for local color , and the student of manners and castoms of that pre-Revolationary period , can not fail to be rewarded by a perusal of these effasions .

		The prac - tice of sending law students to
England	LOCATION	for final study is exemplified , and the worry of a tutor over the pranks of unruly students at
Christmas	LOCATION	time illustrated .

		Of these disturbers of early Prince - ^ n days , the worst seems to have been '' one of oQr suspended bo > s of the name of
Hart	PERSON	from Kentocky . ''

		Several of the letters show a custom , evidently quite prevalent at the time , of graduates writing commencement essays for their neophyte brethren .

		Paterson seems to have been quite gifted in this direction , and quite willing to accommodate his friends .

		Nearly a quarter of a century after taking his degree , he was importuned by a Senior whose need of literary assistance is evidenced by the letter in which he says : ' ■ I have made a trial of my own abilities with a view to my own im - provement and avoid being troublesome to others ; but I distrust my being any way adequate to a suitable preparation and would be scrappy . ''

		The annotating of the present volume is well done by Mr.
W. Jay Mills	PERSON	, previously known in connection with accounts of certain historic homes of
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		The opening words in the Introduc - tion to Mr.
Laurence Button	PERSON	's '' Lit - erary Landmarks of Oxford '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- are characteristic of the easy and pleasant style of the book throughout .

		They carry with them the impression of the author 's real pleasure in his under - taking and remind us of what Mr.
Howells	PERSON	says , that '' to please one 's self honestly and thoroughly is the only way to please others in matters of art . ''

		We can now comfort ourselves with the thought that although we can not , as did Hannah More in
1772	DATE	, '' gallant about '' Oxford with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	for a guide , we can at least participate very vividly in the memories of those old days by reading these pages of Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's .

		The information he gives is not that of the guide books , nor of the ' ■ intelligent local guide '' whose boast it was that be could '' do the ` alls , collidges , and principal hedifices in a noor and a naff '' ; but it is about the things which Mr. Button himself wanted to know and could find in no one place until he had searched many volumes and asked hundreds of questions of '' Dons , of Graduates and Undergraduates , Scouts and Hall porters , of A.ntiqnarie3 and Topographists . ''

		It is very entertaining to know that Dean Stanley in writing to Mrs.
Arnold	PERSON	of her distinguished husband familiarly called him ' - Matt '' ; and to be shown the staircase at
Pembroke	LOCATION	where
Johnson	PERSON	often came `` tumbling down , '' and to know that bis room is still practically unaltered , that two of his desks are preserved , and his tea-pot is in a cabinet in the Bafr - -LRB- htfordatd iUliltrarg sary .

		We are equally interested to learn that
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, with which Royalty and Aristocracy have been associated and where such men as Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	and
John Raskin	PERSON	and
Gladstone	PERSON	have been prominent , was famous also for the pranks of its students .

		That
Walter Pater	PERSON	• ' could almost have swung a kitten if it were a small kitten between his bed , his window and his door '' in his room at Brazenose is a bit of information worth having .

		And a description of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's room at
University College	ORGANIZATION	and a pen-sketch of his window seat are precious glimpses to the reader .

		Anecdotes seri - ous and humorous are scattered through the book , together with odd bits of personal gossip , all of which lend a charm to what might have been , in other hands than Mr.
Button	PERSON	's , a mere category of obscure facts .

		The illustrations in pen and ink , done by Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	, are a very attractive addition to the book .

		A new Lift '' J MadiwK .

		Mr.
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	's ' ■ Life of James Madison '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is evidently an outgrowth of the au - thor 's labors as editor of '' The Writings of
James Madison	PERSON	. ''

		It is a solid work , written with pains - taking care , fortified with references and footnotes , and altogether worthy of respect .

		As compared with the smaller life of the same man by
Sidney Howard Gay	PERSON	, it may be called more valuable as an original study , as it gives more fully the facts of history that form the setting of Madison 's life and of which he was himself a most important part .

		But while the student will rate this book higher , the ordinary reader will be likely to find it some - what dull .

		This is due in part to a lack of bright - ness in the author 's style , but it is also due to the character of the distinguished subject of the biog - raphy .

		Madison was a student , a statesman , a man of the highest worth , but be was not an in - teresting person ; he was to outward appearance cold , as he was insignificant in size .

		He did a magnificent work for our nation in helping to bring about the adoption of the Constitution ; perhaps it might not have come into being if it had not been for his wisdom , influence , and skill .

		Be was a lead - ing figure in the first
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, where the prece - dents were established that decided whether the new government should be a success or a failure ; and his influence there was of immeasurable value .

		Be was a successful Secretary of State under
Jeffer	PERSON	- son , being in hearty sympathy with the democratic revolution that had put that great apostle of theo - retical democracy into the seat of the more aristo - cratic
Washington	LOCATION	and
Adams	PERSON	, though he could not maintain the dignity of bis country against the attacks of all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But he failed as President because of the insurmountable difficulties of his position when both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	were de - termined to prey upon us as the only neutral power , and to prevent our taking advantage of that posi - tion ; he could hardly have been a successful Presi - dent in the quietest times , for he did not know how 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, A history of the
Papal Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	.

		to manage men , and his selections for his cabinet were perhaps the poorest that any President has ever made .

		He was a man of books and of the council , not a man of action ; and the Presi - dency should never have been put upon him .

		Though the author can not make Madison interest - ing to us , he leads us to a hearty respect and even admiration for him both in his public and in his private life .

		In his account of `` The Papal Mon - archy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Dr.
William Barry	PERSON	, Professor of Ecclesiastical History in
St. Mary 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oscott	LOCATION	, takes up the period succeeding the fall of
Rome	LOCATION	and coming down nearly to the modern period , -- to be exact , from 590 to
1303	DATE	, or from the time of Gregory the Great to
Boniface VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the introductory chapters the author develops the growth of the idea of the Pope as the head of
Christendom	LOCATION	, presiding over tem - poral as well as spiritual affairs , and then takes up the main occurrences of the long years in which Christian Rome was in conflict with Northern tribes .

		Presenting in detail the most noteworthy of these events , and indicating by clever summaries the cur - rent of the general movements at work , he carries the story of the Popes through the Mediaeval period .

		History records no more interesting events and episodes , no stories having more of the element of picturesqueness , than these of the followers of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity and the legions of the Roman army carry - ing on their work among the barbarians from one end of
Western Europe	LOCATION	to the other , -- of Popes compelling Emperors to bow to them , of Crusaders struggling heroically for possession of the Holy Sepulchre .

		It is `` a tragedy and a romance ; or , as the millions of the faithful believe , a prophecy and a fulfilment . ''

		The author 's point of view is not sectarian .

		He treats his sul -RRB- ject broadly , and , concerning himself merely with the facts of history , in clear and graphic style pictures to us
Rome	LOCATION	as '' the mother of civilization , the source to Western peoples of religion , law , and order , of learning , art , and civic institutions , '' giving to the multitudes which settled down within the boundaries of the West '' a brain , a conscience , and an imagination , which at length transformed them into the
Chris	PERSON	- tendom that
Augustine	PERSON	had foreseen . ''

		Two maps and fifty-eight illustrations -- the latter represent - ing old mosaics , coins , frescoes , and paintings , -- add much to the interest and usefulness of the work .

		The lighti of a/lerrioon .

		The title of Mrs.
Celia Parker	PERSON	Wool - ley 's new book , '' The Western Slope '' -LRB- William S. Lord -RRB- , must not be misunderstood .

		The author holds that we enter upon the western slope of life at thirty , -- rather earlier than most of us would be ready to admit ; and her book is not a glorification of old age .

		It is rather a view , from over the crest of the hill , of '' the way we have come . ''

		It glimpses the last forty years or so of progress in religion , so - cial effort , and literature .

		What Mrs.
WooUey	PERSON	has to say on these subjects is wisdom , and much of it is wit besides .

		She sees the '' eastern slope '' in a serene but not unbrilliant light , -- the light of afternoon sunshine ; and though her presentment id sometimes a little categorical , from crowding too much into a limited space , it has in it both spirit and truth .

		She finds that religion has become sweeter because deed has replaced dogma , and our social endeavors more sane because we realize that the needy ones of earth ask '' not alms , but a friend . ''

		Her faith falters a little at the literary outlook , because form has become so much to us ; she thinks '' the art of saying things has about reached its zenith , but great things to be said still await their spokesman . ''

		The strongest note of her philosophy is that which denies that the good of the whole can be distinct from that of the indi - vidual . ''

		The social mechanism is no mechanism at all ; it is a great , big , throbbing human heart , and every time you or I suffer a new loss , perform a mean or careless action , that great heart beats with one more throb of pain . ''

		The little book will awaken thoughtful interest among readers who have attained the easy slope of life which she defines .

		Horace Oreeiey '' The place to Study
Horace Greeley	PERSON	studied in his is in his newspaper , '' says Mr.
Will	PERSON	- newspaper .

		- ^ ^ ^
Alexander Linn	PERSON	, whose biog - raphy of the great journalist has just been added to the '' Historic Lives Series '' of Messrs. D. Ap - pleton
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Linn	PERSON	has adhered steadfastly to this belief , departing from it only when taking some of the material for the early part of
Greeley	ORGANIZATION	's career from his own '' Recollections of a Busy Life . ''

		The result is a well-written newspaper sketch of the founder of '' The Tribune , '' taking up each national event during
Greeley	PERSON	's editorship and showing his attitude toward it , offering quotations from '' The Tribune '' to give each statement due support , but lacking sympathy with the personality of the sub - ject .

		In inverse ratio to
Parton	PERSON	's life of
Greeley	LOCATION	, which has stood the test of time , one here finds
Greeley	PERSON	the politician first ,
Greeley	PERSON	the reformer next , and
Horace Greeley	PERSON	last of all .

		Neither writer has spared the foibles , the stubbornness , and the frequent tendency to be on the wrong side , which characterized the well-meaning
Greeley	PERSON	; but the recent biography is devoid of the con amove touch which
Parton	ORGANIZATION	possesses .

		Admirers of
Greeley	LOCATION	-- and there must be such , despite his political , social , and religious heresies , -- will regret that the present author , measuring the editor by the newspaper yard - stick , can find no motive for the reforms attempted by him in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	other than by advertising '' The Tribune '' and securing some notoriety for himself .

		To the same selfish impulse is largely attributed
Greeley	PERSON	's acceptance of the Liberal nomination in
1872	DATE	, with no credit for the warm-hearted , sym - pathetic nature , which saw true Reconstruction of the South only in kind treatment and the with - drawal of force .

		To establish his point , the author
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 343 cites the increased receipts of `` The Tribune '' counting-room after
Greeley	PERSON	's one term at Wash - ington .

		The volume will be used by those desiring a clear summary of
Greeley	LOCATION	's attitude toward cur - rent events , as well as of important occurrences in his early life ; but it is not likely to be read purely from interest in the story aa here told .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` Twenty Original Piano Compositions by
Franz Liszt	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
August Spanutb	PERSON	, and '' Fifty Songs by
Robert Franz	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
William Foster Aptborp	PERSON	, are the latest additions to the `` Musician 's Library '' published by
Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the opening volumes of this library appeared
last winter	DATE	, we took occasion to commend the enter - prise in the warmest terms , and we need only add upon the present occasion that the editors of the new vol - umes have done their work with marked intelligence , and with a clear recognition of the educational nature of this undertaking .

		The Liszt numbers are selected entirely from the original works , mostly dating from the composer 's early period .

		The Franz songs , on the other band , range through the whole term of the writer 's creative activity .

		Perhaps the most important feature of the `` Vir - ginia '' edition of
Poe	PERSON	was the new life of the poet prepared by the editor , Professor
James A. Harrison	PERSON	, together with the volume of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's letters , then first collected for such a purpose .

		The Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	, who publish the edition , have been well-advised to make a special separate edition of these two volumes of the '' Life and Letters of
Edgar	PERSON	.

		\ llan
Poe	PERSON	, '' thus securing a large constituency who , already possessed of a good text , are yet desirous of adding to their libraries the biographical part of the ''
Virginia	LOCATION	''
Poe	PERSON	, but hardly feel justified in purchasing the entire set of seventeen volumes .

		This library edition of the two volumes is extra-illustrated with portraits and facsimiles , and makes a most presentable appearance .

		During the past half-dozen years the newspaper car - toons of Mr.
John T. McCutcheon	PERSON	have proved a source of daily recurring delight to thousands of Chicagoans .

		That this pleasure may be shared beyond the local coo - fines ,
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have selected an even himdred of the best of Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's draw - ings and published them in a handsome quarto volume , fittingly prefaced by Mr.
George Ade	PERSON	.

		With the tra - ditional school of political cartoonists , who make of their medium a grim weapon of ridicule and abuse , Mr.
Mo	PERSON	-
Cntcheon	PERSON	has nothing to do .

		In his hands the cartoon is a genial contribution to the cause of gaiety and good humor .

		He prefers to deal with subjects of broad , every-day , human interest , giving to politics no more than its due proportionate place in the sum of affairs .

		A keen intelligence and a frolicsome humor are every - where evident in his work ; his fun is always wholesome , and his satire none the less effective because good - natured .

		A word of particular praise should be given the artist 's * • boy '' series ; since ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' and the '' Bad Boy '' of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	we have had no truer rep - resentation of typical boy life .

		This entertaining vol - ume will go far toward establishing Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's title to a foremost place among American cartoonists .

		With the issue for
June	DATE	two new departments will be added and commence - ment made of an extended illustrated series of papers upon
American Ceramics	ORGANIZATION	.

		A welcome volume in the '' Temple Classics '' series -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- is a reprint of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' The Bee '' and miscellaneous essays , edited by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	.

		Miss Bumey 's ''
Evelina	PERSON	, '' in two Tolmnes , has also been added to the same series . ''

		The Story of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Adeline Knapp	PERSON	, is a reading-book for schools published by
Messrs. Silver	ORGANIZATION	,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their `` World and Its People '' series .

		We can not commend the disingenuous chapter which describes the way in which the archi - pelago became an American possession , but the work is otherwise deserving of a certain measure of praise .

		The fashion of turning novels into plays has led in turn to the fashion of '' players ' editions '' of the nov - els converted , which means as a rule that these editions are illustrated by a few photographs of stage scenes and the portrait of some popular actor .

		Count Tolstoy 's `` Resurrection '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , in Mrs.
Maude	PERSON	's translation , is the latest work of fiction to be given this form of publicatiou , and the last that we should have expected 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, to see in sucb guise .

		Bat then , it is also the last that we should have expected would fall into the vandal hands of the playwright .

		The third yearly volume of '' LaChronique de
France	LOCATION	, '' covering the year
1902	DATE	, together with its supplementary '' Carnet Bibliographique , '' have just been received from the
Baron de Coubertin	PERSON	, who seems to be both editor and publisher of these useful little annuals .

		Mr.
Ripley Hitchcock	PERSON	, for many years literary ad - viser to one of the oldest
New York	LOCATION	publishing houses , and the author of several books and numerous maga - zine contributions , has become associated with the firm of
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Company	ORGANIZATION	in the capacity of vice-president .

		In connection with the
Emerson Centenary	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Grier Cooke	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	will publish a revised and enlarged edition of Mr.
John Albee	PERSON	's '' Remem - brances of
Emerson	LOCATION	, '' which Dr.
Edward W. Emerson	PERSON	has spoken of as '' one of the best of the works that have been published about my father . ''

		The first book issued by the new firm of publishers ,
Messrs. Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a tasteful reprint of the morality '' Everyman , '' which has been so impressively performed in several cities of this country during the season just past .

		The text is the version prepared by Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	in
1874	DATE	, from a collation of the earlier editions , and the illustrations are reproductions of quaint old wood-cuts .

		Professor
J. Brough	PERSON	of
the University of Wales	ORGANIZATION	has issued a small volume upon '' The Study of Mental Sci - ence '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- which consists of a series of popu - lar lectures upon the bearings and import of logic and psychology .

		The book is well suited to stimulate an interest in these factors of a liberal education , and especially among those who have to do with the train - ing of young minds .

		A literary rarity of unique interest is now on exhibi - tion in the office of
Martinus Nijhoff	PERSON	, of 114
Fifth Ave.	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		This is an early edition of the '' Ars Poet - ica '' of Horace which at one time belonged to no less a personage than the Italian poet ,
Torquato Tasso	PERSON	, whose autographs it bears .

		The authenticity of the volume and its ownership is duly attested on one of the fly-leaves by the Custodian of the
Biblioteca Vaticana	ORGANIZATION	.

		Before the
end of this month the	DATE
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue in this country Vols .

		I. and III .

Richard Garnett	PERSON	and Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	have been at work for many years .

		The work will be complete in four substantial volumes , the second and fourth of which will appear in
October	DATE	.

		The
London	LOCATION	publisher , Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	, will issue all four of the volumes to - gether in the Fall .

		To their previous editions of several of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's works ,
Messrs. H. B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of Bos - ton have added a reprint of '' Memories and Portraits . ''

		The typography and general make-up of this little vol - ume are unusually pleasing , but the special interest of the edition lies in a number of well-chosen illustra - tions , which include three portraits of
Stevenson	PERSON	in his younger days , pictures of his father and mother , and photographic views of places mentioned in the book .

		New editions of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's novels follow fast upon one another .

		The latest is known as the '' Fireside '' edition , and is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	in connection with
Messrs. Chapman & Hall	ORGANIZATION	of

		TOPICS IN LEADESG PERIODICALS 380 LIST OF NT : W BOOKS 380 NATURE AND BOOKS . ''

		What books shall I read on my gammer onting ? ''

		is a question often asked of one who is something of a naturalist and a reader of books ; and the question covertly implies that one must confine his recommendations to those books that treat more or less directly of Na - ture .

		Now if a
summer	DATE	outing means a sum - mer resort , where society must still supplant solitude , and where there are , therefore , many hours to be beguiled , and long times of waiting on the piazza for the sun to shine after rain and make the excursion possible , then the question of reading is a difficult one .

		The list of good Nature-books is large , and from the list one must choose those that best correspond to the disposition of his questioner , whether it lead him to ferns or flowers , to birds or beasts , or deeper to the hidden meaning of things visible but not half understood .

		If , however , a sum - mer outing means a life in the open fields and woods and waters , where a white tent nestles among the trees and the heart of the forest is telling you all its songs , where you know that just around the point the deer and her fawns are feeding , and the waves and ripples are calling to yon all day long their Indian names , tikoo - wuk , tikoorcuk , tikooiceesuk ^ tikoowuk !

		like a repeated invitation to come oat in yoar canoe and dance with them , -- then the answer is perfectly simple .

		There is but one book to read on such an outing , and that is the open book of Nature herself : for nothing that man has written can stand her competition for half an hour without becoming dull and dreary by comparison .

		This is not the rash expression of a moment , but the sober and rather sorrowful experience of twenty years in which I took my favorite books to the woods , season after season , and brought them back invariably wondering what was the matter with them .

		Ruskin is good reading , and should keep his charm out of doors if anybody can , for he touches Nature most masterfully at times ; bat presently , as you read , like a long-dreaded shower on an excursion comes one of his in - evitable and irrepressible scoldings .

		Yoa take it meekly enough , though you hoped to escape that kind of thing when you went off on your 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, vacation , chastening the spirit of the inner man to receive the discipline , while the outer man grins in his beard like a
Philistine	LOCATION	, knowing he deserves his scolding yet thinking gleefully how the archangels and seraphim will catch it about the heavenly music and architecture when their turn comes .

		In the midst of it all , down comes a red squirrel to add his little stone to those that are being pelted at you .

		He sets up a terrible scolding of his own , barking , snick - ering , reviling you for not seeing things as he sees them , which is just what your author is doing ; and , a thousand to one , you drop Rus - kin to watch the squirrel , who , in the woods at least , does the thing more artistically and with more complete abandon .

		When he has done with his scolding he takes you ofif to see some trinket that he has hidden under a mossy log , and in spite of yourself your half-primitive mind finds the little comedy more interesting than all the seven lamps of architecture .

		Emerson is also good reading , and has many noble words and some exquisite poems about Nature ; but
Emerson	LOCATION	goes through the fields hunting for a thought , and finding it at last in his own head .

		For Nature never puts a thought on the surface of things , and one hates in the summer-time to have to cudgel his brains or to dig in the earth for it like
Jeremiah	PERSON	.

		When he goes through the woods ,
Emerson	PERSON	is like a water-color artist with his eyes at squint trying to determine the precise tone of things ; and you , being a common mortal , prefer to keep your eyes wide open , like a boy at a show , and see everything that is going on .

		When he stops and meditates for hours , taking no account of time like a Hindoo philosopher , you must watch a frog on a log apparently do - ing the same thing ; and if you must think hard -- which is a woeful mistake on a sum - mer outing , for you miss all that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	is say - ing and doing , and a preoccupied man might as well camp on a roof-garden as on
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, -- then it is vastly better to think for yourself once in awhile than to letevenEmersonthinkforyou .

		When you try the poets , you are no better off .


Bryant	PERSON	, who aimed to be the poet of Na - ture , becomes mere jingle , with a suggestion of rag-time in it , beside the soft and perfect har - monies of earth and air and water .

		Shelley 's skylark comes down as if hit with a stone when a hermit thrush rings the first soft bells of his gloria in excelsis ; and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's too pointed morals seem strangely out of place , like a ser - mon at a concert , when you are face to face with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, who receives you absolutely with - out suspicion , as if you were one with the rest of her children who do no wrong , and who ut - ters no complaint or reproach , but is more si - lent than usual , even when you violate her con - fidence and kill her little children and drown the delicate fragrance of her twin-flowers with the smell of your villainous powder .

		This was my own first hard lesson in the matter of books out of doors .

		The second was sharper , and left fewer regrets .

		I left behind these great spirits of literature , and took with me a dozen of the modern Nature-writers for rainy days .

		One of these writers weighed and measured everything ; told you the exact num - ber of birds in a flock , and the precise diameter of the dewdrops on successive mornings ; and he only served to convince me how utterly dreary the common things of Nature may be if the illumination of a man 's own spirit be not shed upon them .

		Another , of many volumes and many mistakes , saw only the bare surface of things , the fur and feathers that clothed the Wood Folk , but nothing of the spirit that ani - mated them .

		As you followed him you shud - dered when he set fire to the silver fringes of a birch-tree and left a blackened and unsightly ruin where a thing of marvellous beauty had been .

		He set his dog on every peaceable wood - chuck , and sent his boy to kill all the chip - munks and sparrows in the neighborhood , at a time when they had their young to care for , to supply the appetite of a ravenous hawk he kept as a pet , -- all this , and much more of the same kind , written soberly for our edification , without a suspicion apparently that he is violat - ing all our best feelings , and that these things are as woefully out of place in the quiet woods as the party of men that you stumble upon , on a
Sunday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	, whose chief reason for be - ing out of doors seems to be the beer-keg that is set up in the place of honor in the midst of them .

		Such a spirit can never understand what it sees , however keen the eyes ; for only love , a sincere love without dissimulation , can interpret the shy life that , like a little child or the going forth of the morning , has no speech nor language that our dull ears can comprehend .

		Another writer , of a cheerful , beautiful spirit , some of whose books I had found delightful reading at home , took you with him on his pleasant rambles through the brush and over the southern mountains , talking cheerfully all the way of all sorts of things , opinions , ideas , theories , -- but that is just what you do n't want in the woods .

		Nature has no opinions or theories ; and she cares nothing for yours .


1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		859 Her life is perfect and complete , -- a joyous , faithful , optimistic thing , -- and you can share it as it is , leaving your society ideas , your doubts and pessimistic questionings , behind ; or she has nothing whatever to give you .

		So I found these pleasant books very much like a company of charming ladies that , after many importunities , I took vrith me on an early morning ramble , '' to see and hear and learn about the birds , '' they said .

		And they chattered so charmingly all together that Nature was quite forgotten , and the only external things we heard were a crow and a flock of blackbirds .

		That was the second unexpected lesson ; but the worst was yet to come ; and I must hang my head as I tell about it , like a dog that finds himself barking at his own shadow by mistake .

		One
summer	DATE	as I started for the woods with a little company of friends , contrary to my usual custom of going alone , one of my own books was published , and the first copy reached me scarcely an hour before my train left .

		I took it along gladly , thinking that now I had found at least one good book for rainy days .

		That was for my friends , of course .

		Knowing the contents , I could hardly be expected to read it much myself , and , remembering my own past experience , I said with the vineyard owner when he played his last card , -- surely they will reverence my book .

		For a month or more I tried every dodge and crafty subterfuge that was possible to a modest man , to get my friends to read the thing .

		It had some interesting observations about animals and birds in it , and the drawings were beautiful .

		I would leave it open carelessly on the camp table , with a strik - ing picture uppermost , whenever I went away salmon fishing or to watch the deer playing ; but invariably on my return it was lying just as I left it .

		When my friends asked me ques - tions about birds or animals they had seen in the woods , I would answer vaguely , and say that I thought there was a book in camp which would tell them all about it .

		And then I would hunt for it , where I knew it was not , and put it hopefully in their hands at last , thinking there was now no way of escape .

		But in a moment or two back they would come with the wretched book under an arm , as if they were going to read it , and ask to be taken out in my canoe , or over the blazed trail to the beaver pond : and in the charm of the thing itself we forgot all about the poor picture of it that we were so shamefully neglecting .

		I gave up Nature-books in the woods after that , and settled down to the four old com - panions , -- the
Faust	LOCATION	, the thumbed Shakes - peare , a copy of
Martineau	PERSON	's essays , and the
King James Bible	PERSON	, that are my usual travelling associates .

		But I must confess frankly that often weeks go by in the woods without seeing one of these old friends opened .

		The truth is , that to read any book in the presence of Nature is simply to neglect the greater inspiration that made the best books possible .

		It is like try - ing to read a volume of poems in the presence of a lovely woman , who is infinitely more in - teresting herself than any of the poems she has inspired .

		So I go back to my thesis , which was prob - ably also in
Emerson	LOCATION	's mind when he wrote : '' See thon bring not to field or stone The fancies foand in books ; Leave author 's eyes , and fetch yonr own , To brave the landscape 's looks , '' and say dogmatically that the only book to read out of doors is the book of Nature herself .

		Spite of all the books that have been written about her , we have hardly as yet learned her alphabet .

		She is like an immense library of clay tablets , with their unknown stories of life and death and human endeavor , and , like a child that loves stories , we are still puzzling out the letters that shall unlock the treasures .

		The first five minutes out of doors brings you to a story whose final chapter , if you ever read it , will be the result of a life 's long lesson , -- and what do you want more for all your idle hours than a life 's lesson to occupy them cheerfully ?

		The ferns that wave by the roadside where the shade is deepest ; the moss that clothes the old rocks of the wood ; the bird that sings you up in the
morning	TIME	, and that sang last in the un - peopled solitudes of
Patagonia	LOCATION	; the squirrel that runs away when you spread him food and comes back presently with a companion to share it , and so reveals a language whose first whisper you have never heard and whose method no naturalist has ever told you about , -- in all these things there are books to be read more interesting than you may have brought with you , or happily left behind on your shelves .

		The facts you see are but the letters given you to read the story that lies behind .

		There is romance here too , the subtle , romantic play of mind whenever you remember or go back to the old garret where your childhood 's rainy days were spent among trunks of old costumes , and claw-footed andirons with griffin beads , and a Revolutionary cocked hat and a brace of horse pistols , and pennyroyal and thoroughwort swinging in fragrant bundles from the dusty 360 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
June 1	DATE	, rafters .

		Here in the woods was where your childhood -- the childhood of your race -- was spent , some uncounted-odd thousands of years ago when your forebears were struggling up through animal individuality to attain their manhood ; and everything you find here has some suggestion and shadowy memory about it that can never be expressed , yet never wholly missed if the mind be open and receptive .

		The timid mother bird that shows first a diplomat 's cun - ning , and then more than a lion 's courage , in shielding her young from your eyes and hands ; the cautious track of a coon , the little brother to the bear , beside the brook where he washed his dinner to give it the taste of fish before eating it ; the cave , into which you must crawl by some inner compulsion ; the stone arrow - head and the wolf 's bones that you find there ; the great skull of a moose , with a ground - bird 's nest in the empty eye-orbit , while the woodmice raise their children within its lofty white dome , -- I can understand perfectly why my friends prefer to go with me , and find these things and let their minds play with them freely , than to read about Nature in books .

		And , as the woods are but the garret of our childhood , I understand too that only a child 's glad spirit will ever half comprehend the joy and inspir - ation to be found there .

		For that is perhaps the best thing that can be said about the woods and waters when you let your eyes see and your own heart speak : it makes you a child once more ; brings back something of the child 's faith , and his cheery , hopeful outlook on the world .

		And that is what every man seeks , or longs for unconsciously , in all his worry and work , and that hovers about him like a dream at dawn when he hies him away to the woods of happy memories : to forget his care and weariness and doubt , and be a child in his father 's house again , ^ jlliam J.

		* '' Of the three hundred cyclamen plants that we set out ourselves on the edge of the grove , not one has shown either blossom or even green leaf -- they are vanished forever .

		The hedge of yellow roses is all dead .

		And the anemones are all autumn bloomers --

		The gardener says there are no gar - den anemones that blossom in the

		I have done exactly as that English book said and not one thing is right . ''

		This is a paragraph from a veritable letter lately received from an American friend who has a new American garden which was to be wholly a
Spring	DATE	garden .

		And she would not permit the local nurseryman and florist to plant it and '' make it like everyone else 's '' ; nor would she ask advice of her neighbors for similar rea - sons .

		But carried into extravagance both of money and hopes by the charm of Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's delightful `` Wood and Garden '' and `` Home and Garden , '' and her rose and her lily books , she followed the Englishwoman 's rules and ex - periences , and even her suggestions and hopes , -- and this is the first `` flowery

		Bulbs , seeds , plants , shrubs , -- not one-tenth of those planted are living .

		She has learned in dismay that an English win - ter is not a New English winter ; that English soil is not American clay and dirt ; that many English plants will neither flourish nor live in American borders ; and that one can not go to English books for practical instruction and help in making American gardens .

		Like the good cook , we must have judgment , else the attract - ive volumes are almost valueless as teachers .

		But at last we have a book on gardens which will not teach us Americans to plant hedges of delicate roses , or banks of cyclamen .

		THE DIAL 361 when it will blossom , and what the blossom will be .

		We learn of annuals and perennials , and bedding out : we are given good sensible lists , with a few descriptions of rare plants , and of i gfarden shrubs : we are told what we can do with them all , what we must not do , and what we can not do : we learn the prices of plants and seeds , the cost of garden-making ; we learn of garden resources , and of makeshifts .

		But the book is not devoted wholly to the practical : it is full of garden-love , of the spirit of happy outdoor life .

		It is a good book , a wholesome book ; it influences you in the read - ing , just as working in the garden does in the doing , -- not walking in the garden merely , but turning over the soil , pulling the weeds , nursing up a drooping plant , getting close to the ground ; you feel bett `` r and truer , -- feel that life is good and is worth living , while there are gardens , and flowers blooming in these gardens , and women who are living and loving both flowers and gardens , and writing about them .

		The author tells of her
Grarden Diary	ORGANIZATION	-- a scrap-book of printed slips and an entry-book for written notes , -- a journal which should be kept bv everyone who owns a garden : for such records afford a wonderful bond of union and of friendly controversy with other garden - owners , as well as a never-ceasing delight to the diary-keeper .

		And in this case the
Garden Diary	ORGANIZATION	has a special signiflcanee , for it is like a promise of a second and even more detailed book on Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	's
Hardy Garden	LOCATION	.

		A good book for Englishmen to use , and Americans to read , has been added to Mr.
John Lanes	PERSON	excellent series of books on En - glish gardening .

		This is devoted to `` The Wild Garden . ''

		and like the others of the series is suggestive rather than definite for consulta - tion by American garden-owners .

		For not only garden-plants but English wild-flowers that grow readily and blossom happily in En - glish glades and meads and copses and spin - neys , refuse to live in our plain woods and pastures .

		And the author surprises us by his report of the behavior of some of our Ameri - can plants in English '' wild gardens '' ; we hardly recognize them .

		He describes the Trailing Arbutus -LRB- ^ Epigrfa repens -RRB- , or collo - quially our Mayflower , as a hardy shrub with flesh-colored flowers , that grows and spreads readily wherever planted .

		It is difficult to think of the Mayflower as a shrub , nor will I call its perfection of pinkne ^ s flesh-color : and I can not believe that it grows and spreads rapidly .

		I bethink me of the whims , the freak - ishness , the shyness , the impossibility , of the demure New England Mayflower that I have always known .

		I remember a certain pine - grove in old
Narragansett	LOCATION	, where , five years ago , many cartloads of forest earth , and hundreds of plants of the longed-for Mayflower , were placed with intelligent thought and loving care by flower-g ^ wers of experience .

		Soil and plants had been conveyed from a pine-grove only three miles distant .

		Both were placed under the same kind of pine-trees , and the same sized trees , and at like distances apart , affording thus the same light and the same shade .

		Both groves were at equal distance from the shore of the bay ; both had occasional stone boulders ; both had the same growth of underbrush .

		Three transplantings were made , to try differ - ent seasons and conditions .

		Did these cher - ished Mayflowers `` grow weU and spread rapidly '' ?

		Not one plant is now living !

		I searched diligently this
spring	DATE	, and found not even a single rusty leaf .

		The handsome book entitled `` The Flower Beautiful , '' is a natural product of our present interest in flowers ; it treats of their decorative use within doors , and is divided into three phases of the subject , -- Ist , their relation to one another : 2d , their relation to the recep - tacle ; 3d , the relation of the whole composi - tion to its environment .

		The text of this book , curiously enough , is much more satisfactory than the illustrations from photographic re - productions ; for we miss color , of course , in the latter , though it is very distinctly conveyed to us by the author 's glowing words , which have an extraordinary power of vivid presentation .

		I will not dwell on his instructions as to the re - lation of flowers to each other , for I find no in - clination among folk who arrange flowers at all to place sweet-peas with asters , from which horror he warns us .

		We have all learned to place each flower-family by itself in its vase .

		The question of this flower-holder is ever a wide - ly considered one .

		Mr. Weed gives us many beautiful examples of the fine Japanese jars and vases for flower-holding : and though he tells of glass vases , only one of his fifty-six illas - trations displays a glass receptacle , and that scarc-ely an artistic one -- a glass tumbler .

		Yet the beautiful and varied glass vases , such as Mrs.
Jekyll	PERSON	's '' Munstead Glasses . ''

		and even the simpler globular and flaring cylindrical forms , are deemed by many flower-lovers our choicest flower-holders .

		With transparent 862 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, vases we have the beauty of the flower-stems added to the blossoms .

		Nor does the author even speak of the splen - did bowls , jars , and ewer-forms of brass and copper of oriental and barbaric make , and the graceful metal jars for various domestic uses in more civilized but simple communities .

		The copper jars are so fine for all the tawny , dull - red and Spanish-pink tints of our native lilies , and our garden-strays -- for the azaleas and rhododendrons -LRB- not purple ones -RRB- of our woods and gardens , for our strangely-tinted peonies and dahlias and hollyhocks and gladioli and bleeding-heart ; and the brass bowls are so fine for iris and lupine , and both are invaluable for great bunches of flowering shrubs and fruit trees -- for dog-wood and choke-cherry and lilacs and snowballs , and for many of our coarser wild-flowers .

		However , this book is not of wild-flowers ; illustrations and text are of garden-blooms .

		One vase of yellow lilies , one of golden-rod , one of lady 's - slipper , and a single plant of tway - blade and trillium , seem a scant showing of wild-flowers for indoors to one who has a vase , bowl , or dish for each and every wild-flower , from pussy-willow , blood-root , hepatica , may - flower ,
Solomon	PERSON	's seal , columbine , through are - thusa , calopogon , ladies ' tresses , grass of Par - nassus , and the last gentians , butter-and-eggs , and golden-rod .

		Of course it takes many years to fill such a vase-closet ; Mrs.
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	had one with vases for every kind and color of poppies .

		In one or two points I differ from Mr. Weed .

		I find no need for warning flower - gatherers and vase-fillers not to '' prefer expen - sive hot-house exotics to the beautiful flowers that surround us out-doors . ''

		Such a preference no longer exists , or is even fashionable .

		On the contrary , I find our greenhouses given over to the forcing for the market of simple '' country '' flowers , such as wall-flowers , stock , spiraeas , deutzias , lilacs , sweet-peas , etc. .

		Nor can I share his preference for the
China	LOCATION	aster .

		He calls it a favorite flower , '' universally beloved , '' and deems it one of our most valued plants for in - door decoration .

		I do not find it popular nor beloved ; and see many reasons why it is not suitable for in-door decoration .

		The foliage is not refined ; the flowers are top-heavy ; the colors are often crude .

		The author names these tints of his Truffant asters : '' bright rose-pink , aster-purple , mauve , magenta , auricula-purple , deep maroon , '' -- not an alluring list .

		The Comet aster , of which there are half-a-dozen illustrations , is to me a specially unpleasing variety .

		The stems of asters are coarse but weak , and almost always must be cut short even when the growth is tall ; therefore the arrangement in vases is necessarily stiff .

		Even Mr.
Weed	PERSON	's photographs , fine as they are , prove this .

		And one-quarter of his illustrations are of asters , -- he is a faithful champion where he loves .

		There can be no variety in arrangement with asters .

		Compare the aster plates in this book with the charming photographs of sweet-peas , the artistic ones of the trollius , the double - buttercup of our old garden , or , still more varied in outline and charm , the beautiful pop - pies .

		These poppy photographs are perfection .

		A special teaching of the book -- the signi - ficance and value of flowers in the school-room , the ways to use them , and to awaken interest in them , -- is given with special force .

		And , indeed , the whole book is full both of power and charm for all '' out-doorlings '' in every page from cover to cover .

		THE DIAL 363
Earnest	LOCATION	observers among both old and young are rising up in every locality , and those in possession of a ready pen are relating the sig - nificant facts in their experience for the benefit of inquiring readers .

		From these sources the general fund of information is constantly en - larging , while the importance and attractive nature of the subject are coming to be more justly appreciated .

		A second contribution from Miss
Effie Big	PERSON	- nell , author of the popular '' Mr.
Chupes	PERSON	and
Miss Jenny	PERSON	, '' makes us acquainted with a con - siderable range of out-door life with which she has established relations of confiding friendli - ness by her gentle and judicious management . ''

		My Woodland Intimates , '' as she properly names them , comprise birds of many kinds , indiscriminate cotton-tails , and a family of be - witching squirrels .

		Miss
Bignell	PERSON	has availed herself of the favorable opportunities afforded a dweller in the country , for keeping her in - timates under daily notice .

		She acknowledges their claim upon her sympathy , as a superior yet kindred personality , and by simple observ - ances is mindful of their comfort .

		She spreads a table for them on a window-ledge in
winter	DATE	, and in a safe resort under the trees in
summer	DATE	.

		Cracked corn , seeds of the sunflower and maple , sweepings of the hay-loft , nuts , moistened bread , crumbled dog-biscuit , even cuttings of apple and banana , are provided to suit the varied tastes of her pretty pensioners .

		The wounded and disabled are tenderly cared for until able to resume their independent habits .

		In return for her faithful attentions , she receives touch - ing evidences of affection .

		She is welcomed and followed in her walks by bands of her feathered friends , who suffer a close approach with undoubted pleasure , and by expressive tones and gestures give token of real gratitude .

		A sharp controversy has lately occurred in the magazines over alleged exaggerations in describing the behavior of wild animals , espe - cially in their methods of parental discipline .

		Miss
Bignell	PERSON	notes an example of stern school - ing among them , which lends credence to various disputed stories bearing on this latter point .

		A pair of red squirrels were her intim - ates of long standing , the female showing par - ticular familiarity and daring .

		She was an habitue of
Balsam Bough Tavern	ORGANIZATION	, and brought her young infant to share in its bounties .

		Of their family life and discipline ,
Miss Bignell	PERSON	writes : '' I have never before witnessed such heroic bringing up , such Spartan training , as that bestowed on her off -
spring	DATE	by this little squirrel lady during one day the baby spent in the table cThote neighborhood .

		Early in the morning I saw her leading the tender , inexperienced little creature to perilous heights among the maples , -- eminences from which on every occasion he promptly fell to the ground with a thud suggestive of the destruction of his entire internal economy .

		Over and over I went to the little flattened-out creature , expecting to find him dead ; but he never failed to pick himself up as .

		soon as his scattered wits and suspended breath re - turned .

		Once or twice he approached me and took refuge in my lap , but at his mother 's angry call and chatter he left me and returned to her .

		We saw her vigorously trouncing and disciplining the poor baby throughout the entire day , and one of our number in - sists that on two or three occasions the Spartan mother slapped her child to give him confidence ! ''

		Miss
Bignell	PERSON	finally interfered and took the baby under her permanent protection .

		It throve , and grew into a family pet , half squirrel-like and half human .

		From the samples above quoted , the value of the au - thor 's studies of her furred and feathered in - timates is plainly apparent .

		None need be told that the '' True Bird Stories from My Note-Books , '' by Mrs.
Olive Thome Miller	PERSON	, are both engaging and authen - tic .

		Their prime purpose is the entertainment of children ; but the adultoneeopening the book will yield to the spell of a talented and engag - ing writer until the last page is finished .

		The stories are short and simple , each enveloping some curious incident in bird-life witnessed by the writer and attesting the infinite variety of disposition and accomplishment possible to the '' tribes of burning plumage and choral voice . ''

		One surprising narrative is connected with the vocal achievements of the robin .

		A bird taken early from the nest had never learned the song of its forefathers .

		Observing its efforts to shape some sort of a coherent melody , a member of the family with whom it dwelt taught it to whistle `` Yankee Doodle . ''

		The robin caught the tune perfectly , and it was thenceforth the sole song in its repertory .

		Another robin , that was confined near a parrot , learned to say '' Aunt Maria '' with the same distinctness as its clever tutor .

		It is claimed by some natur - alists that all singing birds may develop a faculty for speech .

		When the robin , the canary , the goldfinch , the magpie , and the crow have acquired the art , who shall say the capacity is wanting in any member of the group of Oscines ?

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	adds her testimony to the evidence that animals are not insensible to the necessity of a rigorous training of the young .

		One in - stance of this kind , relating to the whip-poor - will , is thus given by her : 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, '' One evening after the whip-poor-will had sung for some weeks , I was s \ irprised to hear a droll baby voice trying to imitate his notes .

		On listening , I found that the elder was teaching the youngster -- actually giving him a music lesson .

		First the perfect song rang out loud and clear , and the weak , quavering voice tried to copy it .

		Then the singer repeated the strain , and the infant tried again .

		So it went on
night after night	TIME	, till the little one could sing almost as well as his father . ''

		The appearance of a new edition of
Thomas Nuttall	PERSON	's manual of the '' Birds of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	'' is an event to be noted with pleasure .

		The earlier two-volumed form is now compressed into one , and in addition to the original wood-cuts the text is illuminated by a series of colored plates representing 110 species .

		The name of
Thomas Nuttall	PERSON	, '' The English-American , '' is held by later ornitho - logists in high respect .

		Botany was his first choice in the field of natural science ; but while collecting the plants native to this country , he found place in his heart for love of the birds , and time in his absorbing pursuits to give them keen and careful observation .

		The first vol - ume of his treatise on ornithology was pub - lished in
1832	DATE	, and the second in
1834	DATE	.

		It was the first '' handbook '' on American birds accessible to the student , and was prized as the work of an expert in scientific methods , and one with a fine feeling for the beauties of his theme .

		Wilson treated about 280 species , in his great work on the birds of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Audubon followed , with his magnificent illustrations of 506 species .


Nuttall	PERSON	describes a little more than 200 , but with much breadth of knowledge and nicety of detail .

		After con - sulting the many authorities who have come after him , we may still go back to his pages for useful bits of information not to be met with elsewhere .

		The picture facing the title-page of `` The Story of a Bird Lover , '' by Mr.
W. E. D. Scott	PERSON	, is a flash-light into the very heart of the au - thor .

		He is sitting in the centre of a spacious room , with scores of wild birds , eating , drink - ing , bathing , flying , singing , or resting quietly on their perches .

		One has alighted on the gen - tleman 's finger ; another on his head , apparently with felonious intent on his hair ; another , on his shoulder ; while others are in various atti - tudes close around him .

		He is at home among them , they are at home with him , and all are on the friendliest terms with each other .

		It is a captivating scene , and a truthful rendering of daily occurrences in the bird-lover 's experience .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	has been associated with
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, as curator of the
Department of Ornithology	ORGANIZATION	, for over thirty years .

		He was the founder of the Museum which does honor , in the extent and value of its collections , to him and to
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		He has travelled widely in search of material with which to stock the de - partment over which he presides .

		He has spent years in the wild regions of the states east and west , and has gleaned a store of fresh knowl - edge from the book which Nature opens to all earnest seekers .

		His natural fondness for the birds was developed into the serious pursuits of the scientist while a student at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	and
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	under the direction of such teachers as
Burt Wilder	PERSON	,
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	, and
Jeffries Wyman	PERSON	.

		The plain unvarnished tale of his adventures could not fail to have many pas - sages awakening sympathy and interest .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	is at present striving to solve certain problems in evolution by an intimate study of birds in captivity .

		He has some five hundred individuals housed in six rooms in his home , and , providing them with conditions in accord with their habits , allows them the utmost free - dom possible to the circumstances .

		It is an experiment of ambitious dimensions , and it is hoped that commensurate results will accrue from it .

		In his revelation of avian idiosyn - cracies , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	has not a more curious story to unfold than that of a pet crow , which some may pronounce a very wise bird , and others a very silly one . ''

		This bird was allowed large liberty , was very tame , and , with the traditional crow propensity for mischief , played many pranks , both edifying and provoking , and some of them almost inconceivable .

		He would pick a rose from the garden , bring it to the steps of the piazza , and then carefully remove each petal , laying them in a pile .

		After this was finished , one by one he would care - fully remove each leaf to the step below , making a new heap there .

		There were three steps to this piazza , and for hours he would move his rose-leaves from one step to another , up and down , seeming to find infinite satisfac - tion in the process .

		The whole was accompanied by much gabble , doubtless in crow language , which seemed to me to indicate at times great pleasure , and at other times rage and irritation , when the wind would disturb his pile of leaves and he had to restore order from chaos . ''

		Verily , a sable Sisyphus , with a self-imposed task , futile and mysterious !

		THE DIAL 865 Tramps axd Ca3ips Afield .

		* Nature not only speaks a various language , but in these later years she is speaking a great deal through the mouths of almost innumer - able interpreters .

		Life in those sinks of ha - manity , oar cities , turns for recreation to simpler methods of living and more natural sur - roundings , -- and turns , too , for re-creation as well .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has noted that , in
America	LOCATION	at least , city people are all country people , either by actual birth or by the remove of a degree or two ; and interest in the open terri - tory adjacent is inevitable .

		Of the sentiment of that cynical Frenchman whose solitary ob - jection to the city was that it is surrounded by country , there is little or nothing in these
United States	LOCATION	.

		Certainly it does not have itself put into books that bring with them a sense of expansiveness and a freer air , at once finer and more delicate .

		Growing luxury too plays its part , as well as the widespread imi - tation of English life : it is not too much to say that the twentieth-century ambition of the well-to-do among Americans is to live in both the city and country , free to go from one to the other as the desire seizes them .

		Of recent writers on the various moods of Nature , few have the outer eye and inward vision of Mr.
Charles Goodrich Whiting	PERSON	.

		In his hours of labor a member of that most mod - em and most urban of crafts , the newspaper profession , he has set up an efficacious antidote to its exacting requirements in long rambles through that blessed
New England	LOCATION	country - side where scenes as wild as ever greeted the eye of a Wampanoag or
Narragansett	ORGANIZATION	are within easy reach of the city dweller .

		With a tried companion , Mr.
Solomon Stebbins	PERSON	, to whom he dedicates his '' Walks in New En - gland '' as '' the best man of wood and field I ever knew , '' he has rambled over hill and dale , forest and meadow , marsh and rock , and gained from all their secret of delight .

		It is not in the gentle
spring	DATE	, nor radiant
summer	DATE	, nor crispy autumn alone that he has sought to dis - cern the inartificial world , but during rain and snow , bitter cold and sultry heat , until he has been able to see Nature whole and let his read - ers enjoy with him the profoundest of her secrets .

		Illa '' - trated .

		New York :
John Lane	PERSON	.

		The handsome volume is made up of little papers in prose , embellished by many repro - ductions of photographs .

		These not sufficing to convey all that he has to say , Mr.
Whiting	PERSON	tnrns to verse , seeking and finding his inspira - tion for it close to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's heart .

		Nor are the prose papers devoid of the essence of poetry .

		They contain innumerable excerpts from the poets , especially from the older American poets ; and it is here that the reader familiar with the writings of the younger singers of
Canada	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	wishes that Mr.
Whiting	PERSON	could have acquainted himself with their work as
weU	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the spirit of the entire book is based upon accurate observation animated by imagination , as may be seen in the following passage from the essay called '' A Sabbath in the Open '' : '' Now surely the spells of the frost are loosened , and those skunk cabbages that choose , and that have not har - ried too much , will presently be humming all over their spadixes with pollen-scattering flowers , -- for there is sound in this work of reproduction , though onr ears are not finely enough attuned to distingnish it .

		Our yet im - perfect senses miss a hundred shades and hues and tints of colour , which artists are ever striving to discover and fix on canvas ; they can not see light where multitudes of living things of so-called lower orders do see light and go about their businesses ; they can not catch the myriad overtones even of the musical instruments we make , no one of which , not even the subtle violin , ever registered the infinite delicacies and refinements of tone that vibrate to the spiritual sense ; they can not hear the corn grow , though they hear the water trickle and the frosts whisper ; and even the movements of the ants in the ground , the beetles in the bark , the larvse in the wood , are only heard by a few whose trained ears have reached a neater touch of hearing . ''

		Fine as these things are , there some even finer in the attitude of Mr.
Whiting	PERSON	toward that part of Nature which is often too little considered , -- humanity .

		In such a paper as '' A Far Easter in the Future , '' he ventures upon prediction , in part as follows : `` The time shall come when there will be no more despoilment of man by his brother man ; when wealth as now conceived will have become a meaningless term ; when all things shall be done for the good of all and nothing for the good of one , -- be that one king , em - peror , priest , president or great capitalist .

		The time shall come , -- and then war will have become a hideous legend of the past , and no more shall men destroy the lives and hopes and happiness of other peoples for a little trivial aggrandizement and the interest of a few ignorant and pitiable men misled by false ideas .

		This is the Easter of the future . ''

		Though the Rev.
James Bnckham	PERSON	is known as the author of a pleasant little book of verses , he is content to limit himself to prose in `` Where Town and Country Meet , '' a volume in which the inspiration is obtained from surroundings 866 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, strikingly like those of Mr.
Whiting	PERSON	's .

		Orig - inally contributed to weekly papers , both re - ligious and secular , these little articles are always those of a city man consciously in the country and eager to lay off the complexities of civilization for the simplicities of open air and out-of-doors .

		As in so many cases where there is an honest love for Nature in all moods , there is manifest in his writing a keenness of the senses , of sight and sound and scent , de - nied -- wisely , let us believe -- to city dwellers .

		The sense of smell being so little in use among men tamed and domesticated , it is a pleasure to come upon such a passage as this : '' To me , the most ethereal and delicious moment of this pursuit of
spring	DATE	is the time when , as we say ,
spring	DATE	is first ` in the air . '

		The expectation of the new budding year is never quite so thrilling , so trans - porting -- Thoreau calls it ' exciting ' -- as then .

		That first changing of the air , in late
February	DATE	and early
March	DATE	, from the winter quality to the
spring	DATE	quality , -- have you not remarked it with all your senses , and been mysteriously and irresistibly elated and exalted thereby , as if body and soul were suddenly set in perfect tune with the music of the spheres ?

		And that earliest whiff of the soil -- is there any perfume to compare with it in delicious suggestiveness ?

		How it recalls all the sweet youthfulness of life and nature !

		I know of nothing like the smell of the soil to bring back the zestful , care-free days of boyhood , and to thrill the soul with intimations and prophecies of its own and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's eternal youth . ''

		Equally devoted to the worship of Nature , but from a practical and more prosaic point of view , is Mr.
Harry Robert	PERSON	's '' The Tramp 's Handbook . ''

		Here one may learn how to put oneself in the way of the delights that Messrs.
Whiting	PERSON	and
Buckham	PERSON	expatiate upon so de - lightfully , -- what to take when on a tramp , how to tie knots , contrive packsaddles , set traps for live things , make and break camp , light fires , .

		cook food , dry clothing , and the like .

		It is a book written primarily for wandering life in
England	LOCATION	, and many a plainsman and mountaineer in
America	LOCATION	could add to its recommendations ; but it is in full accord with the natural instinct that sends the people of the English race a - wan - dering betimes , and it is small enough to be carried in the pocket .

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	, though he mentions the soldier and traveller as those to whom his work should appeal , takes for his motto the finely regardless old phrase , '' It shall be what o'clock I say it is , '' and specifies a more direct appeal to primitive instincts thus : `` When we come really to think and experiment for ourselves , we discover that the so-called comforts and luxuries of our civilization are but the counters -LRB- or coun - terfeit coins -RRB- for which we have been taught to sacrifice our true inheritance of dignity and leisure .

		But com - monly , before this discovery breaks in upon us , we have given hostages and signed contracts whereby our re - version is mortgaged to the hilt , and we have nothing left but to turn cynics and bark at every spectre of our might-have-been .

		Some of us are bold enough to fix a muzzle over the surly jaws of conscience , to repudiate our contracts , to sacrifice our hostages , and escape with the remains of our divine legacy into the backwoods of life .

		On the whole , I think it is such who will derive most value from this little book , the aim of which is merely to tell those who are fresh from the civilized world how they may most simply nourish and protect their bodies without sacrificing their spiritual lives at the altar of the devil of a commercial age . ''

		Most appropriate to the spirit of the book is the inclusion of a glossary of Romany words , and a bibliography of books which may be handily carried on such tramps as the author describes , all of them selected with discrimin - ation and intelligence .


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Books about Trees and Shrubs .

		* It is not likely that forestry will ever rival bird and animal study as a popular diversion .

		It utterly lacks both the human and the epic interest of the latter , -- and incidentally the controversial , so strong just now between the '' scientists '' and the '' nature students , '' to borrow the Rev. Mr.
Long	PERSON	's terminology for the two schools .

		Plant psychology rests on too slight a foundation , and merges too easily into pathetic fallacy , to seem remunerative to the average man ; and the pleasure of the quest is marred by the fact that the tree , once found , is permanently placed , while the bird flits tan - talizingly on to the next thicket .

		But we have lately made fairly sure of the bird .

		The thicket remains , -- a bewildering tangle of trees , shrubs and vines , more interesting because less fa - miliar than the small plants that blossom in its shadow .

		So the tree , hitherto the most neg - lected object in nature , is beginning to claim its share of attention .

		Forest preservation is coming to be ranked on a par with the work of the
Audubon Society	ORGANIZATION	, and landscape gardening is taking its place beside gardening proper as an art equally absorbing and worthy of culti - vation .

		THE DIAL 867 the popular books about them .

		Three of these , recently published , serve to suggest how wide is the field of research and from how many re - munerative points of view it may be overlooked .

		Miss
Harriet L. Keeler	PERSON	's work on '' Our North - ern Shrubs and How to Identify Them '' makes its claim to attention largely through its pict - ures , which supplement the clear and terse de - scriptions so perfectly that the reader can with a minimum of trouble identify any shrub he is likely to come upon , particularly if it is in flower .

		Mr.
H. E. Parkhurst	PERSON	covers a wider field in his account of the '' Trees , Shrubs , and Vines of the
Northeastern United States	LOCATION	. ''

		His aim is much like
Miss Keeler	PERSON	's , -- to acquaint the reader with the distinguishing character - istics and ornamental value of each species described .

		But his method of approach is entirely different , and the basis of his analyti - cal keys is generally the leaf instead of the flower .

		Miss
Maud Going	PERSON	, the author of the third book under consideration , is a nature essayist .

		Identification of species plays but a small part in her scheme of study .

		Her vol - ume called '' With the Trees '' contains a series of delightful rambling sketches , packed full of the tree lore of all the year , from the time '' `` When the
Sap	ORGANIZATION	Stirs '' to the fall of the leaf and the belated golden blossoming of the wych hazel .

		It seems almost superfluous to speak in de - tail of Miss
Keeler	PERSON	's book on '' Our Northern Shrubs , '' further than to say that its general plan is the same as that of her well-known and authoritative work on `` Native Trees . ''

		She writes for the amateur botanist and the nature-lover who wishes a more complete or a more popular description of our wayside bushes and the commoner of our imported shrubs than is given by the ordinary text-book ; and partic - ularly for those who are interested in the dec - oration of city parks and boulevards , country roadsides , school yards , or their own home grounds , and who therefore wish a better un - derstanding of the habits and character of our native shrubs .

		To this end the shrubs are grouped by families -LRB- and why not furnish a key , at least for the larger families , in addition to the guide to genera ? -RRB-

		.

		Each of the two hundred and thirty species that are included is analyzed scientifically and described popularly , generally with especial reference to its origin and history , its hardihood , and its decorative possibilities .

		There are over two hundred plates from photographs and a number from drawings .

		The photographs , all of shrubs in flower or fruit , are very beautiful , and so clear as to make identification perfectly simple , often even without reference to the descriptions .

		Mr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	's work on `` Trees , Shrubs , and Vines '' is necessarily more complicated , since it covers three times as much ground ; and being written in a less popular manner , it demands more effort on the part of the ama - teur reader .

		But such effort is well repaid .

		Considerably over half the book is occupied by analytical keys and botanical descriptions of trees , shrubs , and vines , native to the North - eastern
United States	LOCATION	, or foreign but culti - vated there .

		The descriptions are very simple ; in identifying specimens , no microscope work is required , and outline drawing of leaf forms and venation materially shorten the process .

		But the more characteristic portion of the book consists of several descriptive chapters , several more which deal specifically with the trees in the
New York Central Park	LOCATION	-- a complete list of whose trees , shrubs and vines is given , -- and one chapter devoted to the landscape features of a number of shrubs and vines .

		It is the amateur landscape gardener who will especially enjoy Mr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	's book .

		The author 's ovni bias toward that phase of the subject is clearly shown by his selection of
Central Park	LOCATION	as a basis for study .

		His enthusiasm is contagious ; one lays aside the book with a new and dis - criminating interest in landscape , and a wish to begin decorating something at once .

		Mr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	is already known to students of nature through his books about birds ; Miss Going for hers about wild flowers . ''

		With the Trees '' ought to be read once , and then kept conveniently at hand to be read again by snatches .

		It is full of good things ; but the somewhat hit-or-miss arrangement of them , and the lack of transition from point to point , make it impossible to get hold of everything at first reading .

		However , what the style lacks in coherence it makes up in charm of allusion .

		Miss Going is equally familiar with reports of the
Bureau of Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	and bulletins of the
Department of Forestry	ORGANIZATION	, with
Thoreau	PERSON	's deli - cate descriptions and White 's quaint observa - tions .

		She understands the place of the trees in myth and folk-lore , in modern poetry , Indian handicraft , and the economy of nations .

		These matters , however , are side-issues , subor - dinated to a more strictly scientific interest , in the vital processes of the trees : where they live , how they get their food , how they grow and multiply .

		Methods of wind and insect pollin - ation , and curious devices for seed distribution , 368 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
June 1	DATE	, are perhaps the special topics accorded fullest and most vivid presentation .

		Such chapter titles as '' In a Hillside Pasture , '' '' The Life of the Leaves , '' '' The Cone-Bearers , and their Kin , '' '' Trees of Streets , Parks , and Gardens , '' '' Seed-Time and Sowing , '' will suggest the in - formal method of the book and the wide range of interests covered .

		The essays are beauti - fully illustrated from photographs .

		All three books are attractively bound and well printed .

		Any one of them is certain to direct and stimulate an interest in a fascinating branch of nature-study .

		tion by the seventy-five colortypes of the author 's paintings , which deal not only with landscape sub - jects , but also with the life of the people in city streets , among the fellahin of the
Delta	ORGANIZATION	and the
Bedawin	PERSON	of the desert .

		The technical work on these plates is most excellent , and as illustrations they are exquisite .

		The idealized
Egypt	LOCATION	which we enjoy in these illustrations we find also in the text .

		The author is evidently an optimist , and no misfortune perturbs his wholesome view of life , or shocks his faith in his fellow-men .

		He is ever ready to appre - ciate their point of view , and to excuse their short - comings . ''

		Robbery , with which their name is often associated , is usually more or less incidental , and not a habit , and from their point of view is to some extent justifiable .

		I noticed , on one occasion , a sheykh 's - son wearing a lady 's green silk dressing - gown , and on my asking him where he got it he rather ambiguously replied , ' Well you see , Allah has given those dirty Egyptians all that fat land , where they can see their food growing before them , while our inheritance is this desert . '

		Then , mean - ingly , ' we take toll of the desert . ' ''

		The author writes from personal experience of the
Egypt	LOCATION	and Egyptians of to-day , especially of those parts of which tourists see but little if any .

		His comments on the simplicity and courtesy and hospitality of the people in these untrodden paths are in strange con - trast with the tales of travellers who follow beaten paths where the contamination of the backsheesh has left its blight .

		He is proud of the material prosperity which English control has brought to the country , and especially to the fellahin , and of the record for fair dealing and honesty which the En - glish officials have established . ''

		I speak as an Englishman '' is the strongest appeal which the pro- testing native makes for his veracity .

		The greatest portending evil is the industrial situation caused by the irrigation works and increased demand for labor which the native race can not supply , owing largely to the excessive -LRB- ninety per cent -RRB- death-rate among children .

		This he attributes to the low es - tate of women among the fellahin , where , owing to Moslem influences , she has little legal and social and less religious recognition .

		It is different among the
Bedawin	LOCATION	, where '' she is helpmeet and companion to her lord , and with her children is treated with devotion and respect ; and I believe that the Arab word ' watan ' is the only equivalent in any language for the English word ' home . ' ''

		The book is valu - able for its artistic comments on Egyptian atmos - phere , landscapes , architecture , and domestic arts , interesting because of its sympathetic insight into the conditions and problems of Egyptian social life of today , and commendable for the wholesome spirit which pervades its pages .

		Mr.
A. Henry Savage Lander	ORGANIZATION	's Thibetan exploits have made his fame as a traveller secure .

		Readers of his travels `` Across Coveted Lands '' will find in them the same intrepid explorer , though the adven - tures he narrates are less thrilling than in his former work .

		His route lay from
Baku	LOCATION	across the Caspian
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		369 Sea to
Enzeli	LOCATION	, and thence tbroogh
Persia	LOCATION	and the conntrT of the Belaehs to
India	LOCATION	.

		The anthor 's in - teresta and bis point of view are political , militaiy , and commercial , rather than humanistic , scientific , or esthetic .

		His book is a plea for the extension of British inflaence and trade in these coveted lands , and for comity rather than strife with
Rassia	LOCATION	, whose persistent , unwavering policy of extension is rapidly invading
Northern Persia	LOCATION	.

		He also bemoans what Mr.
Prichard	PERSON	in his book calls the '' brusque nn - adaptability of the Englishman , '' and insists upon the desirability that men for commercial pursaita should be well trained in modern languages , and that the powers of observation should be developed by the study of the sciences .

		To these factors he attributes much of German and American progress in recent years .

		The regions described in this work are lands without forests , daily scorched by heat , pinched by cold , and swept by ceaseless winds .

		Something of the monotony of the landscape and the life of the people has crept into these volume * , so that the reader welcomes any diversion , -- even the exploits of the Persian cats , the anthor 's com - panions on this long journey .

		The manufacture of '' ancient carpets '' is one of the most lucrative in - dustries in
Persia	LOCATION	.

		The desired antiquity is secured by spreading the new carpet in the middle of the street of the bazaar to be trampled by foot passen - gers , donkeys , mules , and camels , for days or weeks , the value of the goods rising as the wear increases .

		Lovers of oriental carpets will find many references to methods of manufacture and types of rugs pro- daeed in the different localities .

		The book is abund - antly and handsomely illustrated by reproduetioaa of excellent photographs taken by the author , and is a most valuable and welcome addition to oar sources of information concerning lands of rising political and commercial importance .

		Travel by sea to-day has been robbed of its ter - rors , not only by steam and steel , but by the patient , plodding , and little-known labors of the ' `` Survey '' ships of oar own and other nations .

		They map the coasts , discover and plot the shoals and hidden rocks , and register the tides and currents with such aeeuraey that the good ship makes port safely be - cause of their labors .

		For four years Dr.
A. Aleoek	PERSON	was attached , as Surgeon and
Naturalist	ORGANIZATION	, to the Ship `` Investigator . ''

		of the
Royal Indian Marine Survey	ORGANIZATION	cruising in Indian Seas .

		The field of opera - tions of this ship included the coasts of Hindoostan and Burmah .

		the
Bay of Bengal	LOCATION	, and the Anda - man and Laccadfve Seas , with the adjacent islands of coral origin .

		Her ports of call are not on the itinerary of any globe-trotter , and even the trading ships shun many of her routes .

		Dr.
Alcock	PERSON	, in his narrative of '' A Naturalist in Indian Seas , '' has clothed the story of his cruises with great interest , principally by his clever description of the work which a Survey ship undertakes , and by his always novel account of the spoils of the sea which the trawl brought up from the vasty deep .

		These are abundantly illustrated .

		There are also accounts of the peoples and the life on the various islets visited by the ship .

		Mingled with the science , which is excellent , there is some philosophy , and some quiet humor which , while it is not often found in works of British scientists , is none the less pleasing .

		There have been several books in the past dealing with the discoveries of the '' Challenger . ''

		the '
• Blake	PERSON	, '' and the more recent German expeditions , most of which are more comprehensive , and contain more scientific detail than is found in Dr.
Alcock	PERSON	's pages .

		There is .

		however , none which portrays so briefly , so clearly , and with interest so well sustained throughout , the life of the depths of the sea , its wonderful adaptations to conditions of darkness , cold , and great preesare , its bizarre and canons forms , and its interesting and instructive associa - tions of commensal organisms in these abysmal sol - itudes .

		Much fresh material was brought to light by the work of the '' Investigator , '' and aboat a third of Dr.
Alcock	PERSON	's book is given over to a more technical account of these discoveries , to a list of the dredging stations , and a bibliography of the scientific pablieations dealing with the material broaght to light by these explorations .

		The book is therefore of great technical value , as well as popular interest .

		The discovery , in recent years , in
Patagonia	LOCATION	, of the fossil remains of a giant sloth christened mylodon by the palssntologists , has led to conjectures that this curious relic of the past might be found still living in the forest fastnesses at the bare of the
Andes	LOCATION	.

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Daily Express . ''

		with com - mendable enterprise , outfitted a scientific expedition in
1900	DATE	, to search for the monster .

		The quest was fruitless ; but the leader of the expedition , Mr.
H. Hesketh Prichard	PERSON	, in his '' Through the Heart of
Patagonia	LOCATION	, '' has broaght before the public an inter - esting account of the expedition .

		The writings of
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	,
Bates	PERSON	, and
Hudson	PERSON	have revealed the plains and forests of
South America	LOCATION	as the naturalist sees them .

		It is in like tenor that Mr.
Prichard	PERSON	has developed his book .

		-- a fitting addi - tion to an already memorable list of naturalists ' wanderings in the southern continent .

		Darwin touched only the fringes of
Patagonia	LOCATION	; but
Prichard	PERSON	was enabled to push his explorations across the plains to the glacier-fed lakes , to gain an intimate knowledge of the fast disappearing Tehaelche tribe , and to learn much of the ways of wild animals in regions where man 's destructive habits are unknown and unfeared by wild things .

		The writer is ob - servant , quite as much of men as of nature ; and his story never lacks interest .

		The illustrations , from photographs , are numerous and excellent ; and there are also seven plates in color , by
J. G. MiUais	PERSON	, of birds and mammals , which in composi - tion and color are hardly equal to the work of American artists in this field .

		Interest in many lines centres in Dr.
Carl Peters	PERSON	's ''
Eldorado	LOCATION	of the Ancients . ''

		His preface contains his justification for the acts of cruelty for which he was relieved of the governorship of German East 870 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	,
Africa	LOCATION	.

		His main thesis is that the gold of Ophir of
David	PERSON	and
Solomon	PERSON	came from
South Africa	LOCATION	; that the land of Ophir -LRB- Afur -RRB- , or Punt of the Egyptians , was reached by trading ships which ascended the
Zambesi	LOCATION	, and that the word
Africa	LOCATION	itself may be derived from the ancient name of this legendary country .

		The evidence which the author marshals in support of his contention is convincing : Semitic customs and mot words in the language and geog - raphical names of native tribes in the gold country , ancient records in
Egypt	LOCATION	, and Egyptian antiquities in the regions of
Rhodesia	LOCATION	and
Portuguese East Africa	LOCATION	, where immense areas bear evidence of sur - face workings and mines of prodigious extent of prehistoric origin .

		The author describes his ex - plorations in the kingdom of
Macombe	LOCATION	, whom the Portuguese have never subdued , and in adjacent British territory .

		His comments on the undevel - oped resources of this country , and on the political and industrial situation in
South Africa	LOCATION	, are both interesting and opportune .

		German developments in this part of the world in the next few years will be watched with interest by all readers of Dr.
Peters	PERSON	's book .

		Uncommercialized readers will take strong issue with the author 's view of the labor problem in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		He rightly deplores the unwillingness of the blacks to work , and the inad - equacy of the usual penalties of civilized procedure in restraining petty crime ; and justly claims that the blacks should make some return to the com - munity for security of life and property which the advent of civilization has brought to them .

		He de - plores the '' Uncle Tom '' sentimentality , and the interference of
Exeter Hall	ORGANIZATION	ideals with the regula - tion of the relations of the races in this land .

		Only practical men , who have to do with the difficulties , should be allowed to determine the policy .

		His so - lution is '' forced labor '' under government control .

		Each negro should be compelled to work at least six months in each year for a white man , or he should be compelled to work for the state for twelve years at the munificent salary of shelter , food , and two shillings a month , with the privileges of
Sunday	DATE	and marrying !

		The state would make its profit by hiring the blacks , at an advance , to the mine-owners .

		Here lies the joker in this benevolent scheme .


May Exeter Hall	ORGANIZATION	and
Herr Bebel	PERSON	long live to prevent any such exploitation of native races by the machinery of the state for the remote object of in - culcating in future generations of blacks an appre - ciation of the benefits of toil and the immediate purpose of creating dividends for foreign corpora - tions !

		The author mentions with approval the successful work of Bishop
Hartzell	PERSON	in industrial education of the blacks in the American mission schools at
Umtali	LOCATION	.

		New motives , new needs , new desires , and new capabilities , which are thus in - spired in the few , will in time leaven the race and afford a solution of the labor problem in its present form .

		Sketches of sojourn in the
Gatinais	LOCATION	,
Bourbonnais	PERSON	, and Champagne are published by
Miss Betham	LOCATION	-
Edwards	PERSON	under the title of '' East of
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The author is an English lady , an '' offioier de l' Instruc - tion Publique de
France	LOCATION	'' and she writes with an artist 's appreciation of the picturesque , an histo - rian 's keenness for all that links the present with the past , and a gentle appreciation of French folk and their ways that belies her British ancestry .

		Among other things , we find an interesting account of
Nemours	ORGANIZATION	, a favorite haunt of
Balzac	LOCATION	, but to-day without a book-shop !

		Near this place , at
Episy	LOCATION	, was projected the chapel and a mound in memory of the Polish patriot Kosciusko , who spent the
last fifteen years	DATE	of his life in the village .

		Pro-Russian politics have forbidden the completion of the chapel by the villagers .

		Students of contemporary history and politics will appreciate the chapter of this work dealing with
Germanized Alsace	ORGANIZATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	.

		The point of view of the author on this subject i '' frankly French ; but it will be a hardened
Teuton	PERSON	who will not agree that , for Catholic French - speaking
Lorraine	PERSON	at least , the present national boundary drawn and maintained by the sword i '' most unfortunate .

		Six dainty colored plates , after paintings by Mr.
Henry Detmold	PERSON	, adorn the book .

		In his '' European Days and Ways , '' General
James F. Rusling	PERSON	aims to give '' a common-sense account of
Europe	LOCATION	as it is . ''

		We find a plain straightforward unvarnished tale of travel from
Italy	LOCATION	to
Scotland	LOCATION	by way of most of the great centres of interest on the Continent , -- a tale which contains the frank comments of a practical American man of affairs upon European peoples and customs , told without art or restraint .

		The book is packed -- not padded -- with information .

		We learn how many counterpanes and salt-cellars the good ship ''
Aller	PERSON	'' carried , how many square yards there are in
St. Peters	LOCATION	, the daily per capita consumption of beer in
Munich	LOCATION	, and the number of guns
Wellington	LOCATION	had at
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		This information , together with the comments on hotels , pensions , churches , galleries , and railways , makes the work a fair sort of a guide - book .

		The author is intensely American , loyal to his country , its rulers , and its institutions , to his faith and his temperance principles .

		Because of this purpose and this point of view , and withal because of the shrewdness and scope of the observations , the book is a valuable human document .

		It will strike a responsive chord in many Americans whose views are not usually placed in print .

		His com - ments are not , however , to our credit in every in - stance , -- as , for example , his discussion of the relative cost of municipal government in
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, and his comment on German universities . ''

		Possibly we Americans are putting too much money in buildings .

		Surely ' brains ' are of more importance than mere brick -LRB- or stone -RRB- and mortar . ''

		The exigencies of a Colombian revolution com - pelled
Sefior Perez Triana	PERSON	to make the hazardous journey from
Bogota	LOCATION	down the
Andes	LOCATION	to the river
Tua	PERSON	, and thence '' Down the Orinoco in a Canoe . ''

		The country traversed is rich in natural resources , and is destined to grow in commercial and political
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 importance .

		Hence this book , which is a running commentary on conditions now prevalent in that land , is of more than passing interest .

		The author , the son of an ex-president of
Colombia	LOCATION	, is well qual - ified to interpret nature and the natives whom he meets .

		The book is written with Castilian senti - ment , fluency , and ease , and in style is unique among recent books of travel .

		To this enjoyable feature of the book there is added the novelty of a land little known , a land of illimitable llanos and impenetrable forests , of magnificent waterways and wonderful range of tropical resources , and of an uncivilized simple people , robbed and betrayed by their own governors , and by foreign traders who are their only revelation of a more enlightened world beyond the confines of their primeval solitudes .

		A brief account of the Arctic explorations of the Duke of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	is found in his book entitled '' Farther North than
Nansen	PERSON	. ''

		The thin volume , of less than a hundred pages , is not so ponderous as the elaborate reports of his predecessors in the fight for fame in the Arctic ice , but it is no less interesting .

		Simplicity and directness mark the tale , which the reader is loth to drop till it is fin - ished .

		The Duke modestly claims that the achieve - ments of Arctic explorers have resulted in great material , commercial , and scientific benefits to the world .

		But these have little interest to most peo - ple , and , it may be , benefit them even less than the proof which such men as the author furnish that , with will , courage , and perseverance , man can dare anything , even though all the powers of Nature are in alliance against him .

		Surely , 86 ° 33
' 49	DATE	'' of latitude stirs the pulses in every man of action .

		As a bit of book-making the volume leaves much to be desired , -- lacking a table of contents , some subdivisions , a map , and an index .

		The pictures appear to have been taken in the twilight of the Arctic night , -- for which the photographer may not be to blame , -- and to have been printed with the grime of a
London	LOCATION	fog .

		Mr.
Paul Fountain	PERSON	is an amateur naturalist who disdains the professional scientist and all his ways .

		But this has not interfered with his preparing a very readable account of his wanderings through `` The Great Mountains and Forests of
South America	LOCATION	. ''

		He is a lover of the wilderness , and no hardship daunts him , no obstacle seems insurmountable .

		His journeys were made along the great Brazilian waterways , and through the Andes from
Chili	LOCATION	to
Ecuador	LOCATION	.

		He is a keen observer of nature , and gives in a matter-of-fact sort of way , without pretense to literary merit or claims of scientific value , a very full record of the beasts , birds , reptiles , fishes , and insects which he encountered .

		There is a lack of relief in the book ; the map is missing , and the few illustrations might well have been omitted .

		Mr.
S. G. Bayne	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, describes his trip '' On an Irish Jaunting Car through
Donegal	LOCATION	and
Connemara	LOCATION	'' for the edification of American citizens who do not have a first-band acquaintance with '' the finest natural scenery in the world , and by all odds the greatest display of verdure in all its varj - ing shades and colors . ''

		The author knows
Ireland	LOCATION	too well to portray it to the uninitiated .

		Instead of giving as a picture of
Ireland	LOCATION	and the Irish of to - day and some insight into conditions affecting the Irish problem , he delves deeply into the ancient annals of * ' The Four Masters , '' and embellishes his ride of 350 miles with historic incident and an oc - casional story .

		The illustrations , which are apt and taking , in a measure make up for this shortcoming .

		The charm of mountain-climbing , as well as ita hardships and great dangers , are revealed in Mr.
J. Norman Collie	PERSON	's ' ■ Climbing on the Himalaya and Other Mountain Ranges . ''

		About half of the book is given to an account of various perilous ascents amid the peaks and glaciers of the Himalaya Moun - tains , while the remaining chapters are devoted to the Alps , the
Lofoten Islands	LOCATION	, and the mountains of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		American enthusiasts in this field will find a comprehensive account of the Selkirks accessible from the
Canadian Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	, and a good map , with routes , of this region , '' the
Switzerland	LOCATION	of

		372 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, story , and extending to nearly a hundred pages .

		We could say nothing of these stories that has not been said many times before .

		They are like their countless predecessors , and yet their charm is un - failing , and they may be read with a zest from which the edge is hardly worn , however familiar we may be with the scores , if not hundreds , that have delighted us in the earlier years .

		Mr.
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	, teacher , mathe - matician , editor , diplomatist , poet , and novelist , is a man whose ventures in the field of literature have been of such quality as to make the public wish that they were more frequent .

		His first novel , * ' But Yet a Woman , '' was published fully twenty -
five years ago	DATE	, and must still be reckoned one of the best works of fiction that
America	LOCATION	has produced .

		Its successors , `` Passe Rose '' and `` The Wind of Destiny , '' were slighter performances , but they had the rare charm of refined literary art , and rose re - freshingly superior to the current standards of our fiction .

		Now , after many years , we have another novel , `` His Daughter First , '' which is a sequel to `` The Wind of Destiny '' in the sense that certain of the characters of the earlier novel reappear , al - though not in the sense of anything like continuity of plot .

		The new book is certainly charming , al - though we miss something of the delicate romantic feeling that characterized its predecessors , and are in many ways made conscious of the subtle dis - tinctions that must ever exist between youth and middle age , even in the modes of self-expression of the same personality .

		The modern note becomes almost jarring at times , especially when the specu - lations of the stock market are introduced as a mo - tive , but on the whole Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	remains true to his finer artistic instincts .

		In a novel of strictly private and modern American interest , we must do without the glamour of the age of Charlemagne and the lofty old-world idealism of his first book ; what we get is careful delineation of character , and a skilfully contrived set of domestic relations that lead to the happiness of the chief persons con - cerned , after the usual entanglements without which a novel of this type can not exist .

		Mr.
George Cram Cook	PERSON	's story of the ill-starred Mexican Empire of the sixties fills us with a sense of wonder that this excellent romantic material has been so long neglected .

		It seems to be a case of the hour and the man , for ''
Roderick Taliaferro	PERSON	'' is a novel of absorbing interest , and for the first time gives us a satisfactory romantic treatment of the American imperial experiment of
Maximilian	PERSON	and
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		In reading it , of course , our sym - pathies must be all on the wrong side , for not only is the hero an unreconciled Confederate officer , filled with bitterness at the recent collapse of the slave - ocracy , but the whole treatment of the Mexican theme is such as to make us share the hopes of the imperialists and to mourn with them in their down -
fall	DATE	.

		In this respect the book reminds us of the many romances of Stuart intrigue and invasion , which force the heart of the reader to be at war with the head .

		But if we can forget our principles for the nonce , we shall be well rewarded by Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's striking story .

		The hero is rather too much of a dare-devil to be convincing , and his love-making is somewhat too luscious for our Anglo-Saxon taste , but the swift action of the work , its abundance of exciting episodes , and its underlying fund of knowl - edge concerning the scenes and characters depicted , are qualities that go far to atone for a few rather obvious defects .

		The character of
Maximilian	PERSON	, in particular , is finely studied , and presented with close fidelity to historical fact .

		We are always sure of entertainment in a his - torical novel by Mr.
Joseph Altsheler	PERSON	.

		He has an eye for the picturesque phases of American history , and much skill in the construction of a plot .

		We do not expect any marked degree of literary quality , but we can count upon stirring action which verges upon melodrama , and a generous infusion of sentimental interest .

		In `` Before the Dawn '' he has taken the last period of the Civil War for his subject , and made the capital of the Confederacy the scene about which the story centres .

		The fighting in the
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	is vigorously described in a series of chapters , and the capture of
Richmond	LOCATION	occupies the closing scene .

		We have for hero and heroine the conventional figures -- in this case a Southern sol - dier and a young woman of Northern sympathies .

		She comes to
Richmond	LOCATION	, is suspected of being a Union spy , escapes with the connivance of her lover , figures as a ministering angel on the field of battle , and returns to join her lover at the end .

		Her orig - inal presence and purpose in the camp of the enemy are enveloped in mystery , and here is the one note - worthy defect of the novel .

		We have a right to expect a striking solution of a mystery thus heralded , and we get what is practically no explanation at all .

		The fact seems to be that she is brought to Rich - mond simply because the author had to have such a heroine in that place .

		We are certainly glad to have her there , but we should also be glad to have her advent accounted for in some rational manner , Another Civil War story of the conventional sort is Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's `` The Southerners . ''

		The only thing we miss in this case is the custom - ary Northern hero .

		It is true that the hero is an officer in the
United States navy	ORGANIZATION	, which gives us the necessary antagonism that love reconciles in the end , but the situation is rather weakened by the fact that he is a son of
Alabama	LOCATION	, and that the hero - ine has been his sweetheart from childhood .

		The story is naval rather than military , and reaches its climax in
Farragut	LOCATION	's exploit at Mobile .

		There are several chapters of bare history unmixed with romance which the reader will do well to skip al - together .

		The book again exemplifies the combi - nation of manliness and sentiment which character - izes Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's other stories .

		The success obtained by
Miss Liljencrantz	PERSON	with her book of last year , '' The Thrall of
Leif	PERSON	the Lucky , '' has encouraged her to renewed efforts in a similar
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 37S field .

		At about the time when one Nor '' eman discoTering a new world , another was reconquering for the Danes the island kiogdom of
Britain	LOCATION	.

		The greatest man of the brief dynasty which he estab - lished , whose name we commonly spell
Canate	LOCATION	, is the central figare of this new romance , which is at least the eqaal of its predecessor in grasp of its sab - jeet , and in the skill with which the bare statements of fact foand in the old chronicles are adorned with romantic and vital interest .

		■ ■ The Ward of King Canate '' is the title of this really charming work of historical fiction .

		The ward is a Danish maiden , and her lover is a noble Angle who rescues her from peril , and whom she in tarn afterwards befriends in an effective way .

		Bat Canate is , after all , the dom - inant figare of the book , which deals particularly with his strife against
Edmund Ironsides	PERSON	and his eventaal peaceful occap '' ation of the kingdom .

		He is made the subject of a fine character-study , and we witness the development in him of those qual - ities which made him so great a man in after life .

		The colored illustrations by Mr. and Mrs.
Kinney	PERSON	help not a little to make this book one of the most attractive of the year .

		In '' The Triumph of Count
Ostermann	PERSON	, '' ''
Graham	PERSON	Hope '' -LRB- whom we understand to be a lady -RRB- has done something more than to construct an historical romance pure and simple .

		She has given OS a really vivid and at the same time conscientious sketch of the last years of
Peter the Great	PERSON	, and of the slow upbuilding of the Western capital which forever remains as the memorial of his genius .

		The • • mi-barbaric life of the time is pictured with much skiU , and the manners of a corrupt and brutal eonrt are unsparingly described .

		The German minister of
Peter	PERSON	is , as the title indicates , the hero of the work , and his triumph is twofold : first , it is the triumph , almost until the end , of personal integrity and far-seeing statesmanship over the forces of in - trigne and deceit ; second , it is the triumph of the man in his private capacity over the young princess to whom he is wedded by royal command , but who despises him for his p > easant origin , and only after a long struggle with herself comes to recognize his nobility of character and to share with him her fullest sympathies .

		The scope of the tale carries us far beyond the death of
Peter	PERSON	, and shows us how the minister holds his owni until treachery undoes faim , and he is setting out for his Siberian exile , accompanied by the wife who has now learned to recognize his worth .

		The Puritan Revolution in
England	LOCATION	has been a good deal overworked by recent novelists , bat the list of Cromwellian romances stiU has room for as g ^ ood a book as Miss
McChesney	PERSON	's '' Cornet Strong of
Ireton	LOCATION	's Horse . ''

		The author has already won a considerable degree of success in dealing with this period of English history , and her work has a foundation of solid historical information .

		The main feature of her present plot is one that strains onr credulity , to say the least .

		Cornet Strong is rep - resented as a Puritan soldier of the fanatical type , a hard rider and a doaghty warrior , yet in the end he turns out to be a woman in disguise , and the mother of the young ofScer who is the conventional hero .

		Aside from this feature the plot is of the hackneyed sort .

		The heroine is a royalist maiden , haughty and irreconcilable , but finally so sub - dued by her love that she weds the hero in spite of the fact that duty has compelled him to order the execution of her brother , caught acting as a royalist spy .

		This contravention of the osual can - ons of romantic fiction is rather startling , bat the author meets the difficulty boldly , and almost over - comes it .

		Miss
McChesney	PERSON	has caught the spirit of her period with marked success , and her narra - tive is skilfally handled .

		It is romance of a quite different species that meets as in ' ■
The House	ORGANIZATION	on the Hudson , '' by
Mias Frances Powell	PERSON	, who appears to be a new writer .

		The book may be described as a blend of > '
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' with the sort of melodramatic fiction that enthralled our youthful interest in the days when the `` New York Weekly '' had power to charm .

		Such a heroine we have not encoaatered for many years .

		Her name is
Athena	ORGANIZATION	, she is divinely beaa - tif al , speaks half a dozen langoages , and is an adept in most of the manly sports .

		When she lays ont the athletic hero with a single calculated thump , our admiration knows no bounds .

		For those who like bighly-spieed sensationalism in their fiction , this book is not likely to find any competitors among recent novels .

		It is high-fiown in both diction and imag ^ nation , and has enough of literary quality to lift it fairly above the level of the ordinary '' shocker . ''

		The stories of Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	ORGANIZATION	are not merely romantic in constraction and incident ; they are also romantic in atmosphere , which is a great deal more important . '

		* The Star Dreamer '' repeata the sueeesB of '' The Light of Scarthey , '' a statement which is equivalent to high praise , indeed , and as an example of conoatently romantic fiction would be hard to match among present-day productions , out - side of the other work of the gifted authors .

		It is a work of rich and glowing beaaty of style , offer - ing much variety of scene and character , and based up > on a plot which moves slowly at first , but which toward the end attains a momentum that leaves as fairly breathless .

		The scene is an ancient English castle , and the time about a handred years ago .

		We can g ^ aarantee the fortunate readers of this book a season of unalloyed enjoyment in communion with the lovely scenes which it depicts and the noble souls which it portrays .

		Such a book as this is indeed an oasis in the dreary waste of onr carrent fiction .

		• The Gold Wolf , '' by Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	, is also romance of a sort , bat it is modem , nervous , melodramatic , and crude in its coloring .

		It aboonds in glaring improbabilities , and it is continually rais - ing interesting points that are left half-explained or not at all .

		Cheap , sensational devices are the writ - er 's main reliance , and the imaginative touch of certain of his earlier romances is almost wholly miss - ing .

		A man of many millions , almost driven to 874 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, insanity by the high tension of a life spent in mani - pulating the stock market , does not make a partic - ularly sympathetic sort of hero , and there is no heroine worth mentioning .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has written better books than this , and we hope that he may write more of them .

		`` The Traitors , '' by Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	, is a romance of the hackneyed '' Zenda '' sort , but sufficiently vigorous and well-planned to make its existence justifiable .

		The scene is the kingdom of Theos , which is conveniently situated in the Bal - kans , and is the object of brutal Turkish assault and perfidious Russian diplomacy .

		English power is the DeMS ex machina which saves it from destruction when sore beset by its foes .

		This is brought about by a clever newspaper correspondent .

		The King is a fine fellow who has won his spurs in the En - glish army , and the woman who becomes his queen is the daughter of an American millionaire .

		In this respect the story is much happier than its `` Zenda '' The English novelist who selects a Spanish back - ground for the scenic investiture of his work is not , as a rule , distinguished by his knowledge of Span - ish life .

		He is generally content to give us the con - ventional stage properties , the stock situations , and the hackneyed turns of phrase , that stand for
Spain	LOCATION	in the book-fed imaginations of most readers , and trusts to the spirit of romance to do the rest .

		Not so Mr.
Paul Gwynne	PERSON	, the author of `` The Pagan at the Shrine . ''

		One may almost complain of him that he knows
Spain	LOCATION	too well , for his book is so freighted with folk-lore and local custom , and the sort of detail that means intimate acquaintance with the homely life of the people , that the story itself suffers from the richness of its setting .

		The extraneous matter which thus loads it down is so extraordinarily interesting that we are loth to indulge in even so slight an adverse criticism as is above implied , but the fact remains that the plot is now and then a bit difficult to follow .

		In its main outline the story is simple enough .

		A young Jesuit brother commits a mortal sin , and keeps it a secret .

		All the rest of his life is one long expiation , but the consequences of the sin return to plague him , and bring the mat - ter to tragic issue in the end .

		His natural son is slain through a horrible misunderstanding , and the unhappy father falls dead in the very hour of bis long-delayed public confession .

		This novel is one of the most remarkable of the season , for it is one of the rare books that , in the guise of fiction , are genuine revelations of human life under exceptionally inter - esting conditions .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS . ''

		The Mannerings '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , latest of Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	's works of fiction , is a true novel and one far above the average of the books poured out upon the reading world with such profusion .

		It deals with the narrow life of some well-bred people in
New England	LOCATION	, and with some characters not so well bred , suggesting provincialism on every page .

		There are more princi - pal characters than will ordinarily be found in a work devoted to portraying the development of character , and
Miss Brown	PERSON	's skill leaves no one of them on quite the same ground at the close of the book that he occupied at the beginning .

		A question in literary casuistry is raised which bids fair to dominate the situ - ations as a whole , but it is fortunately permitted to oc - cupy no undue space .

		Were
Miss Brown	PERSON	to enlarge her sphere of action , she would stand almost alone among the women novelists of the country ; she has , in fact , outgrown
New England	LOCATION	already to an extent of which she does not seem to be aware .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	shows a return to his older -- and better -- manner in his latest volume , `` The Better Sort '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is a collection of short stories , most of which have appeared in magazines during the last few years , and all dealing with men and women whose position in society seems to have given name to the book .

		The characters show the subtlety of analysis which has long been Mr.
James	PERSON	's peculiar province to exploit in literature , hut they lack in good part the in - volution of thought and phrase which has bewildered so many readers who have not followed his career from its beginnings .

		As usual in his recent work , Mr.
James	PERSON	finds the background for most of the stories in
London	LOCATION	; hut his knowledge of
America	LOCATION	and its people enables him to introduce his countrymen and countrywomen at will , whenever he needs a character not quite in unison with the highly civilized circle whose home centres in the metropolis .

		Because of its greater simplicity of style and treatment , the book may be recommended to a larger circle than anything written by Mr.
James	PERSON	in the last five years , with the certainty of not disappoint - ing its constituents .

		A variant of the ''
Enoch Arden	PERSON	'' theme forms the basis for Mr.
John H. Whitson	PERSON	's ''
Barbara	PERSON	, a Woman of the West '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with the scene ranging from a
Kansas	LOCATION	ranch , through the mining regions of
Colorado	LOCATION	, to the pleasant climate and out - of-door life of
Southern California	LOCATION	.

		The husband , a selfish fellow with artistic tastes , leaves his wife when bitten by the prospecting fever , and suffers injuries that destroy his sense of identity and in the end his life , leav - ing Barbara to support herself as best she can .

		She enters the newspaper world , and develops marked qual - ifications for her work ; but when she receives word of her lost spouse she gives that up and is thrown into al - most daily contact with the man she afterwards marries .

		The proof of her husband 's death is soon overthrown , but he has the grace to expire in her arms , and she is re-married to the man she loves .

		This bald statement does little justice to the real merit of the work , which makes a more than ordinarily careful discrimination between
Barbara	PERSON	's various environments , introducing numbers of typical characters .

		Nothing could be more welcome than the substitution of the speech of a man imbued with the language of Shakespeare for the ordinary dialect of the American countryman , which Mr.
Irving Bacheller	PERSON	has effected

		THE DIAL 376 in his newest and best novel , ' ■

		If Mr.
Mnnkittriek	PERSON	' B sonl exploding * ■ io one great b ` gosk ! ''

		had aajthiag to do with the change from the manner of ''
Eben Holden	PERSON	, '' he deserves the thanks of the reading commnnitj .

		The character that tbe title commemorates is an Irishman , widelj trarelled and read , who has settled down as an itineraat mender and vendor of clocks in central
New York	LOCATION	, in the earlier half of the eenturv gone .

		He makes friends with a little waif growing into mmmhooi , awmkeaa kis desire for knowledge , and toward Ithe ekwe of tbe atorf ofimi fcJMMlf as aT Jea rio i laerifice when the lad , th `` i growa to manhood , ia a e wi ted of the crime of another .

		There is an idvllism of treatment that argues a Tastly greater and better literarr future for Mr.
BaebeQer	PERSON	than could be inferred from his two books preceding , and it is rather wonderful that they succeeded so thor - onghlr in obscuring tbe really delightful scholarship here shared with the world for tbe first time in the form of fiction , though long known to the authcw ** friends and acquaintance . ''

		Life 's Common War '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- is tMi oat of the eoaamon way in its settings and characters , though we fiad hwe the griefs and sorrows that come to all , as weQ as many things that most of us , happily or unhappily , can never have .

		The heroine of the storv -LRB- it is markedly deroid of masculine heroic material -RRB- is
Drsnla Keith	PERSON	, an inphiarid girl of wealth and poHtion in
Boatoii	LOCATION	.

		In tbe earlier pages especially , she is as bright and cheerful a figure as one can hope to read about , and the charae - tetnatians of her friends and aoqnaintaaeesare both hn - moroas and vivid , -- as where we are introdaeed to the sort of person of whom tbe author , Mrs.
Annie Eliot Trumbull	PERSON	, says , '' Everything always reminded her of sooaething quite different . ''

		Somewhat to tbe leadst ^ a surprise , tbe narrative dips into a question of easaisUy , and one involving the ethics of labor-troubles into the bargain .

		With this is commingled
Ursula	PERSON	's marriage to the wrong person , her determination to leave him , aad her final acceptance of her duty in the premises as the final guardian of her husband 's integrity .

		For all its lack of definiteness of aim , the book is always inter - esting and much of it entertaining .


Northumberland	LOCATION	is the scene of Mr.
Ellsworth Law	PERSON	- son 's story , '' From the Unvarying Star '' -LRB-
Maemillan	PERSON	-RCB- .

		It tells of the life , in a small English mannfaetaiiag town , of a non-conformist paiaoa , in love with tbe daogb - ter of his senior elder , the wealthiest man of the ooo - gregation .

		There is conflict with another of the chareh I ` ff ^ ` f '' .

		endeavor to rescue those in sore trials from the eSeets of their own indiscretion , and very little at - tempt at the setting forth of dogma .

		Tbe love story is beautifully idyllic , having in it much of the charm of Mr.
Lawaoo	PERSON	's former work , and the mingling of this with tbe melodrama of crime of one sort and another gives the book an tmevenness which works to its detri - ment .

		Yet there are evidences of wide reading and a love for the best poetry , so that a real literary flavor is giren to the book .

		It is to be said that the general impression of tbe work is one of promise rather than fulfilment .

		Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	has gone back to an earlier field for the material from which he has cod - structed the semi-detached episodes of far Western life which make up '' The Bishop , Being Some Account of his Strange Adventures on the Plains '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- .

		It may very well have been Bishop
Whipple	PERSON	who serves as the central figure , and unquestionably Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's own life as a iiiiiaiiWMfj ia thos e parts has provided him with more than one incident .

		These are of varied Talnei ^ aad in some the connection with the prelate in qaeatioa is slight , -- as when he is called to marry a eoople whose ante-marital deeds provide tbe real interest .

		The fnll flavor of a past or paanng time is in tbe work , which deserves setting down oo that aeeonnt alone .

		In addi - tion , the writer has an abundaoee of power , and his work is never uninteresting . ''

		Elizabeth 's Children '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- -- tbcM see -- to be a literary fashicm ia names , and '' Filiiahrth * is in the height of it , -- is from an anonymous hand , bat evidently not that of the reeent '' visits '' and ■ ■ letten . ''

		An English bachelor is iadaeed to take-care for a sea - son of three little lads , sons of an old flame of his by her French husband .

		The youngsters have a delightful time in the English eoantiy bouse of their temporary guardian , -- a more delightful time by far than they allotted to him .

		They have an alluring dialect of the maearoBie sort , aeeounted for by one of them , who ob - served '' dat Papa almost always speak de English be - cause he tink
Maman	PERSON	like dat de best , aad
Maman	PERSON	speak de French to os beeaose she tink Papa like dat de best . ''

		Long before tbe atoiy has proceeded through its course , the reader will have fallen in love with the children , and will be grateful for the part they take in aiding their boat in his own little romanee .

		The book is distinctly entertaiaiag .

		In Mrs. - \ liee
Doer Miller	PERSON	's story of '' The Modera Obstacle '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- , a girl of position and talent in the higher circles of
New York	LOCATION	society falls in love with a musician , a charming fellow with an ability that runs almost into genius in his art , in which he has her entire sympathy .

		But the commercial agencies would rate him as owaiag ao Moce tbaa sixty thoosand dol - lars , -- and tbia , for ber , mwias poverty or exile .

		The ingenious mnsieiaa , bowever , finds himself soffering from a disease that appears boand to take him off ia six months , -- and as his wealth is deemed aaffieient to last out that term , the twain are made one .

		But he does not die at the time set , so goes to
Cuba	LOCATION	to make the now needed fortune .

		Here he is made the heir of a wealthy planter ; and the planter first , and the hns - band later , die in the most aeeommodatiag ' '' -- -- ■ '' ' - ia Older to reward tba lady for bar dintareatedaeH .

		Some diMj ^ ointaaeat will be felt , by those who know the andMic ' a piiisas .

		that so little poetry should appear in tbe conception and execution of the story ; but it is not one in which tender sentiment finds much place .

		Mr.
B. K. Benson	PERSON	's fourth book , * ■ Old
Squire	PERSON	, the Romance of a Black Virginian '' -LRB-
Macmillan	PERSON	-RCB- , is a sequel to the work jast preeeding it , in the aeaae ii aai ^ tba Morgaa twins again as the central ^ ares of tba aaic ^ dvs , though the old slave from whom tbe book ia aaawd is really its protagonist .

		As in all the -LSB- iii i iiiiw iiilain from this hand , the account is closely historieal , its data obtained from authentic sources , and its eoneem with the Civil War .

		Tbe mystery which has characterized its predecessors is wanting here , tbe utilization of the
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	twins supplying this element afresh .

		As in the former works , the events of the war are fully realized and most interestingly interwoven with the fictional characters .

		The old slave , as we are told by the author 's note , is an historic peraonaga , at least in the latter part of the story , which haa abaadant romanee to endear it to that mysterious pwra o aiiit y , the average reader . ''

		At the
Time Appointed	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is by Mr.
A. M. Barbour	PERSON	, who wrote `` That Mainwaring Affair '' a 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, year or two ago .

		Like its predecessor , tlie newer work is a '' mystery '' story , beginning with a cold-blooded murder and ending with another murder and a suicide , the interval being filled with love-making and a more or less interesting case of suspended individuality .

		To the hardened reader of this sort of story , the `` mystery '' is at no time very deeply mysterious ; but to the novice it will probably contain enough of the element of suspense to keep him interested from cover to cover .

		The scene is in the mining regions of the
West	LOCATION	; there is a long-lost father , a Mexican bandit , a wronged wife , and enough of the usual apparatus of this form of reading matter to make it worthy of perusal during the coming heated term .

		Good old melodramatic romance is to be found in `` The Spoils of Empire '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the work of Mr.
Francis Newton Thorpe	PERSON	.

		The story has to do with the expedition of Cortfes , the overthrow of the Aztec empire , the Spanish Inquisition , and a num - ber of kindred topics , treated in a manner curiously reminiscent of the days of
Ainsworth	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	.

		The
Mexico	LOCATION	is that of
Prescott	PERSON	rather than of
Fiske	PERSON	, and there is no apparent disposition to make the Aztecs the inferiors of the Spaniards in any essential , -- much as in General
Lew Wallace	PERSON	's '' The Fair God . ''

		It would be idle to say that a story so replete with striking situations , conspiracies , battles , sudden death , and religious strug - gles , is lacking in interest ; and those who have not yet advanced beyond an enjoyment of Bulwer-Lytton at his noisiest will like Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	's work to the full .

		Between Mr.
Churchill Williams	PERSON	's '' The Captain '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , which follows the fortunes of Grant as far as the fall of
Vicksburg	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's '' The Crisis , '' which occupies itself largely with the same remarkable figure , there is likely to be confusion in the reader 's mind .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	shows Grant in his early days in
Missouri	LOCATION	, after he had left the army for the first time , follows his fortunes to
Galena	LOCATION	and
Springfield	LOCATION	, and thence on through the siege of
Vicks	LOCATION	- burg .

		His hero is a young Missourian who opens a law-office in
Galena	LOCATION	, enlists in
Grant	LOCATION	's own regiment , and becomes a member of his staff .

		There is a free use of historical persons , as of historical anecdotes ; and though the general tone of the book and the romance it embodies is wholly unlike Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's , one still has ground for wonder at the temerity , or independence , or both , which have gone into the one just now published , the popularity of its predecessor being taken into ac - count .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's is much the shorter of the two -- and none the worse on that account , -- and it is far enough removed from the story of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	mu - nicipal politics , which was his first essay in fiction , to permit auspicious augury for his literary future .

		But it would deserve much higher praise had it preceded , rather than followed , '' The Crisis . ''

		One may suspect Mr.
Edward W. Townsend	PERSON	of a really clever satire upon the element in
New York	LOCATION	which calls itself real society , in contradiction to the poodle - dinner-givers and their friends among the higher mam - malia , in his cleverly written series of letters , '' A Sum - mer in
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The heroine of these let - ters is the daughter of a wealthy Westerner who has made his millions in iron , his ancestors having been of the first circles of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, where his sister , fortu - nately married , still occupies a leading place .

		The daughter , joint heiress to these millions , comes to the city for the first time , and is duly inducted into the select life of its most fashionable folk .

		She there learns the higher wisdom at a rate that would be more alarming ^ if it were less laughworthy , -- imbibing , for example , such maxims from her aunt 's worldly lips as '' A man - ner of not being quite so good as we are is sometimes a safeguard against being mistaken for something not nearly so good as we are . ''

		Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	has no dif - ficulty in providing such a girl with suitors , so he sets himself the more difficult task of providing her princi - pal suitors with life-partners also , and the bright little book ends with what might be called a matrimonial orgy .

		Miss
Mary E. Wilkins	PERSON	that was , Mrs.
Charles Man	PERSON	- ning
Freeman	PERSON	that is , has produced some really astonish - ing results in the way of mysteries in the book of short stories which she calls '' The Wind in the
Rose Bush	PERSON	, and Other Tales of the Supernatural '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Without the use of the element of hor - ror that characterizes Bulwer-Lytton 's '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	and the Brain '' or the work of
Poe	PERSON	in the same field , rely - ing rather upon terror , so different a sentiment , she con - structs out of the ordinary , commonplace , every-day life of
New England	LOCATION	a number of episodes that will send the most hardened to bed with an uneasy glance behind .

		It is inevitably crime , or something closely akin to crime , that lies behind her various weirdnesses ; but she has the wise economy of narration which refuses to disclose most of these deeds of shame , and her work may fairly be called engrossing . ''

		Wee Macgreegor '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- is the pleasant work of Mr.
James Joy Bell	PERSON	, who seems not to be as well known on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as his two cheerfully writ - ten little books of verse for children warrant .

		The story is made up of a series of episodes in the life of a small
Glasgow	LOCATION	lad ,
Macgregor Eobinson	PERSON	by name , who with his father , a decent mechanic , his mother , a capable housewife , his small sister
Jeannie	PERSON	, his '' Grandpaw ''
Purdie	PERSON	, and several neighbors and their offspring , consti - tute the dramatis personal .

		Macgregor is the common or '' garden '' variety of boy , -- no thoroughly equipped household is without just such another , -- and his joys and sorrows will be entered into by affectionately dis - posed and sadly worried parents everywhere .

		Much of the delicious humor of the book is due to the lowland Scotch dialect affected by the
Robinson	PERSON	family , and the reader will be grateful for the glossary of terms with which the narrative is prefaced .

		Miss
Josephine Daskam	PERSON	's '' Middle-Aged Love Stories '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- teach that love is no respecter of persons who are still unmated , no matter how clearly they may regard themselves as committed to an earthly celibacy .

		Her theme requires that there shall be no marked disparity of years between the belated couples she makes happy , and there will not be lacking those who will hold as eminently undesirable the wholesome matter-of-fact sort of women she selects for her men , and the idling and jaded men she selects for her women .

		This is probably due to the fact that in a large part of her narrative Miss Daskam relies upon imagination , experience failing .

		There is a great deal of shrewd analysis of motives and character in every one of the seven tales of which the book is made up , but there will still be wonder whether the general attitude of middle - aged women is quite as complaisant as Miss Daskam makes it appear , -- the `` Yes , sir , and thankee too '' of the old story . ''

		Richard Rosny '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- is an extended story of English life among the upper middle class , in which the hero appears to be kept in an assortment of miseries from the first chapter to the last through one device or

		THE DIAL 377 another on the part of his womenfolk . ''

		Maxwell Gray '' -LRB- Miss
M. G. Tuttiett	PERSON	-RRB- makes her hero an officer in the
Roral Narj	ORGANIZATION	.

		His mother forces him to qait the service , but not until the reader has had time to wonder why English authors in general make so little use of their naval officers in their fiction .

		The book is earefullj written , contains a number of exciting epi - sodes by way of relief to the general sordidness of the characters , and really preaches a covert sermon against extravagance .

		Tragedy , outgrown and liTcd out into serenity and peace , is the note of Miss
Eleanor G. Hayden	PERSON	's ' ■ From a Thatched Cottage '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is an unusual story in other respects , the results being attained by simple means , and the entire volume strewn with description !

		that are fully lyrical in their essence .

		The scene is laid in
England	LOCATION	, the people are of the lower middle class , the time is the present .

		There is a good deal of rural dialect used to give local color , but even this is not overdone , and is quite intelligible to the American reader .

		With the rest goes rustic humor , skilfully used to relieve the sombreness of the opening chapters , which antedate the later by three generations .

		Miss
Hayden	PERSON	has the literary gift , and is using it to excel - lent advantage .

		Some follies and some downright disagreeable things will be found in '' The Stumbling Block '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edwin Pugh	PERSON	, and he has made a tragical ending to his book with little warning to his readers , -- always an error in judgment .

		Nevertheless the book impresses one as having power , both latent and expressed ; and it is certainly original .

		The respectable portions of Bo - hemia in
London	LOCATION	provide the character * , after a prologue that seems -- like the flowers in
spring	DATE	-- to have little to do with the case .

		Two women love a single man , and this is permitted to end in the death , almost the murder , of one of them , and the final taking off of the other , though by no means an essentially tragic com - plication .

		That it is treated humorously at the outset makes it the more objectionable to those who like well - ordered narrative .

		Still , Mr.
Pugh	PERSON	will be heard from again , and willingly .

		Astonishingly easy is it to make a living by litera - ture in one or another of its forms , -- so easy that most professional writers who have won their way through the usual gauntlet of public indifference and private discouragement will be thankful for the improbability which attaches to the heroine in Miss
Annie Flint	PERSON	's '' A Girl of Ideas '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The heroine is seemingly a girl like others , except that she has a collegiate edu - cation , an utterly self-devoted girl friend , and a con - venient uncle who stands behind as a deva ex mackina to help her oot of difficulties otherwise hopeless .

		But `` Uncle Tom '' is never once appealed to ; bis niece opens an office in
New York	LOCATION	, announcing herself as ready to sell ideas to writers of every sort .

		From the day she first opens it , there is no further difficulty about her living .

		All sorts of authors flock to her for the one great requisite , ideas ; and she furnishes them in a profusion that will make the most heedless sit up in won - der .

		The one difficulty comes from selling the same idea to two individuals , resulting in a charge of pla - giarism against the famous one of the two , -- and there the romance of the story lies .

		It is a fully modern book , and will interest the great and growing army of scribblers .

		`` D wight Tilton '' is the pseudonym adopted by the person who writes '' On Satan 's Mount '' -LRB-
C. M. Clark Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a work chiefly concerned with the press - ing question of the rich growing richer and the poor poorer .

		Like too many novels with so evident a pur - pose behind it , the zeal of the author runs away with his sense of proportion , and the reading becomes dull where it is intended to be most faaeiaating .

		A young man of Scotch parentage rises to be the confidential secretary of the richest man in
America	LOCATION	.

		He resigns the position when he finds himself expected to crush oat all opposition to his employer 's will by means legal enough , but profoundly immoral in both inception and results .

		He becomes a newspaper man until the papers with which he is connected fall under the influence of his old employer , whereupon he turns to politics .

		His interest in labor problems calls him into the cabinet of the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, the hard times over - spreading the country drive the middle and lower clas - ses into revolt , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	refuses to act , and just as the President takes things into his own hands he is killed , and , as all of his cabinet had resigned with the exception of the hero , the hero becomes President and marries the girl of his choice , the multimillionaire 's daughter .

		Sacket 's Harbor more particnlarly , but northern
New York	LOCATION	in general , give Mr.
Olin L. Lyman	PERSON	the material from which to construct '' The Trail of the Grand Seig - neur '' -LRB-
New Amsterdam Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The French ele - ment there persisted through the War of
1812	DATE	, with the incidents of which the rather slender love-story of the book is compounded .

		There is a suggestion of Cooper in the Indians who enter into the narrative , there is a great deal of '' good '' fighting , and the story as a whole makes a patriotic appeal to Americans .

		Neces - sarily there is melodrama , not the least sensational of the characters being a dog who works out the dramatic climax for his dying owner .

		The illostrations are in color , not too carefully printed .

		Romances of the war of the Rebellion are still rife , though Mr.
William Henry Babcock	PERSON	's '' Kent Fort Manor '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- is far above many such works in im - partiality and dignity of treatment .

		Most of the story passes in the spot -LRB- a real one -RRB- which gives title to the book , -- a large tract of land not far from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, where Federals and Confederates were more evenly balanced in numbers than elsewhere , the region being too civilized for the brutalities of border warfare prac - ticed farther West , though there is an abundance of the horrors of war in the narrative .

		There is cause for congratulation in Mr.
Babcock	PERSON	's personal freedom from these sentiments as such , or from glorying in the wantonness of civil strife ; for the book can be read withont rancor on the part of sympathizers with the two great bodies of contestants , and with interest by aU .

		To believe that an untrained lad , however mosieally inclined and however good the instrument given him , should be able to play the violin the first time he tries , is something of a tax on the imagination ; but that it can be done successfully , we have the assurance of Miss
Harriet Bartnett	PERSON	in `` Angelo the Musician '' -LRB-
Godfrey A. S. Wieners	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The scene changes from
San Francisco	LOCATION	and back again , the interest of the narrative always cen - tring about the little Italian boy who grows to a famous manhood through the kindness of a man of benevolence and wealth .

		A strong tendency to melodrama manifests itself in the later chapters of the book , and there is a rather abrupt transition from mosic to politics and sociology near its close .

		How to Make School Gardens , '' a manual for teachers and pupils , by Mr.
H. D. Hemenway	PERSON	, is a text-book published by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ruskin 's '' King of the
Golden River	LOCATION	, '' edited by Miss
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	, is an addition to the '' Can - terbury Classics '' for children published by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish
Paul Ford	PERSON	's ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	'' in a `` players ' edition , '' with many illustrations from the stage , and a colored medallion portrait of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		We have received from
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's a new edition of Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's early novel , '' A Mummer 's Wife . ''

		The volume contains no indication of the fact that it is a reprint of an old work .

		The Apocrypha is now being added to the '' Temple '' Bible of the Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	, and we have before us at this moment a volume containing the two books of the Maccabees , edited by Mr.
W. Fairweather	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish an edition of '' White 's
Selborne	LOCATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Richard Kearton	PERSON	, which has for its distinctive feature a series of more than a hundred photographic illustrations taken directly from natural objects .

		The
April	DATE	issue of `` The Library , '' an English quar - terly devoted to bibliographical and library matters , appears in an American edition , bearing the imprint of the
Scott-Thaw Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The list of contents is unusually attractive , including articles by Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		The
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	sends us a quarto volume of '' Results of Observations with the
Zenith Telescope	ORGANIZATION	of the
Flower Astronomical Observatory	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This work , made up wholly of tabulated measurements , is prepared by Director
Charles L. Doolittle	PERSON	, and rep - resents the observations of three years .

		The
Chicago Literary Press Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, composed of a number of writers and newspaper men of this city , has recently been formed for the conduct of a general liter - ary business , including the purchase and disposal of manuscripts , syndicate matter , etc. .

		Mr.
Will M. Hight	PERSON	, late manager of '' The Gentleman 's Magazine , '' is in charge of the enterprise . ''

		The Art of Living Long , '' published in
Milwaukee	LOCATION	by Mr.
William F. Butler	PERSON	, is a new translation of '' La
Vita Sobria	PERSON	, '' by the Venetian centenarian ,
Alvise Coruaro	PERSON	.

		Germane extracts from
Addison	PERSON	,
Bacon	LOCATION	, and
Temple	ORGANIZATION	are added , and a group of essays upon
Cornaro	PERSON	himself , his family , and his villas .

		The whole makes a curiously interesting volume , and its preparation has clearly been a labor of love to the translator and editor .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just issued a folder giving a sketch of this old
Boston	LOCATION	publishing house , from which it appears that the firm traces its origin back to
1784	DATE	.

		It is , therefore , the oldest establishment of its kind in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Since
1898	DATE	, when the business of
Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	was acquired ,
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	have been publishing more books of fiction , in addition to law , and subscription books , and books of a miscellaneous nature .

		Recent decennial publications of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	include the following quarto pamphlets : '' Oogenesis in
Saprolegnia	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Bradley Moore Davis	PERSON	; '' The Animal Ecology of the Cold Spring Sand Spit , '' by Professor
C. B. Davenport	PERSON	; '' On the
Beckmann Rearrangement	PERSON	, '' by Professor
Julius Stieglitz	PERSON	; '' Practical Sociology in the Service of Social Ethics , '' by Professor
Charles Richmond Henderson	PERSON	; '' Existence , Meaning , and Reality , '' by Professor
A. W. Moore	PERSON	; '' A Sketch of the Linguistic Conditions of
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' by Professor Carl Darling Buck ; '' Dimensions of Direct-Current Dynamo -
Electric Machines	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Carl Kinsley	PERSON	; and `` The Finer Structure of the Neurones in the Nervous System of the White Rat , '' by Mr.
Shinkishi Hatai	PERSON	. ''

		Political Parties and Party Problems in the United States '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Professor
James Albert Wood	PERSON	- burn , is a companion volume to '' The American Repub - lic and Its Government , '' by the same author .

		The two books together form a treatment of civil govern - ment in this country , both theoretical and historical , which is admirably fitted for the use of colleges .

		In fact , the author 's declared aim has been to prepare a work intermediate between the elementary text-book and such comprehensive treatises as those of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	and Mr.
Ostrogorski	PERSON	.

		Professor
Woodburn	PERSON	is thor - oughly acquainted with the history of our party politics , and his sympathies are as a rule wisely enlisted .

		His work is deserving of very warm commendation .


Richard Henry Stoddard	PERSON	, the veteran poet , critic , and journalist , died at his home in
New York	LOCATION	, on the morn - ing of
May 12	DATE	, having nearly completed his seventy - eighth year .

		Although a New Englander by birth , he became a New Yorker in childhood , and remained one to the end of his days .

		Tailoring , blacksmithing , iron moulding , and law office work were among his early ventures , before he gained the recognition as a writer toward which his ambitions had been drifting from his boyhood years .

		In early manhood he began sending contributions in verse and prose to the periodicals , and his first volume of poems , called '' Footprints , '' was pub - lished in
1849	DATE	, when he was twenty-four years of age .

		Soon thereafter , he married
Elizabeth Barstow	PERSON	, the woman of genius who remained his helpmeet until about a year ago .

		A position in the
New York Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, held from
1853	DATE	to
1870	DATE	, gave him a livelihood during his most productive literary period .

		During the last ten of these years he was the literary reviewer of the '' World , '' and for the
last quarter-century	DATE	he has held a similar position with the `` Mail and Express . ''

		His books are many , including juveniles , critical monographs , and collections of verse , besides those to which his re - lation was editorial .

		It is as a lyrist that he will be chiefly remembered , and his poetical contribution to American literature is both considerable and important .

		He has never been a popular poet , in the sense in which his famous
New England	LOCATION	contemporaries were popular , but the judicious know his work and esteem it highly .

		The closest of his surviving friends , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, has characterized his poetry as exhibiting `` affluence , sincere feeling , strength , a manner peculiarly his own , very delicate fancy , and , above all , an imagination at times exceeded by that of no other American poet . ''

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's writing was so voluminous , and so much of it was mere journalism , that the great bulk of it is already consigned to oblivion , but enough of it will live to insure the holding of his memory in grateful recollec - tion .

		The anthologist will always resort to his treasury for exquisite examples of song , and sometime , perhaps , we may have a single volume iu which his best shall be garnered for posterity .

		A volume of literary recollec - tions was prepared by him just before his death , and will be published during the coming season .

		Cloth 8vo , each volume
$ 6.00	MONEY	net , on orders for sets only .

		`` THESE four volumes present to the reader an illustrated review of English Literature from the earliest times to ' the close of the nineteenth century .

		The authors , who are at once scholars of the highest attainments and mas - ters of the art of concise and luminous exposition , have aimed at producing a book that shall stimulate and gratify curiosity concerning the great writers of their country and the evolution of its literary history .

		This '' illustrated record '' will , it is hoped , be welcomed by all who are interested in the study of English Literature as warmly sa the illustrated edition of the late
John Richard Qreen	PERSON	's well-known work has been by students of English History .

		A consecutive history of the entire course of English Literature from Anglo-Saxon times to our own day will be given in one type , so that this , if the reader desires , can be read alone as a narrative of the evolution of English style .

		In a different type , a biography of each author will be supplied , relating in close detail , and with all necessary dates , the facts of his life .

		From the works of each leading writer at least one characteristic quotation will be made in a third type , and this will form an anthology of English Literature from the earliest times to our own day .

		Volume I. extends from the Anglo-Saxon period to the days of Tyndale and
Coverdale	PERSON	,
Surrey	LOCATION	and
Wyatt	PERSON	; Volume II .

		deals with Elizabethan and Jacobean writers ; Volume III .

		conducts the reader from
Milton	LOCATION	to
Johnson	PERSON	and
Goldsmith	PERSON	; and Volume IV .

		brings the record down to our time .

		The volumes have been lavishly illustrated .

		Many hundreds of cuts , chosen after much laborious research , are inserted in the text ; there are forty full-page pho - togravure plates , and thirty plates printed in color .

		An important feature of the first volume is the reproduction of richly illuminated mediaeval manuscripts .

		The chapter devoted to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	has been illustrated with exceptional fulness , and the illustrations to the notice of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	are of the highest interest .

		On the subject of miracle plays , ballads , and early Scotch poets and the English Bible , much valuable illustrative matter has been collected .

		In the second volume it was , unfortunately , impossible in many instances to give portraits , for the simple reason that they do not exist .

		No portrait is known of
Marlowe	PERSON	or Lyly or
Peele	PERSON	or
Webster	PERSON	or
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, to name only a few distinguished dramatists of the Elizabethan age .

		But wherever anthentic portraits are known , they have been repro - duced .

		This was the age of fantastically illustrated engraved title-pages , and in both the second and the early part of the third volume these have been made a special feature .

		Facsimiles of autograph letters and
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		in prose and verse have been freely interspersed , nor has topographical illustration been neglected .

		When we reach the age of
Milton	LOCATION	, in the third volume , there is an embarras de richesse of illustration ; the task becomes one of selection rather than collection .

		Of Milton himself no fewer than six portraits , representing him from childhood to his sixty-third year , have been engraved ; and a similar fulness of portraiture has been accorded to Pope ,
Johnson	PERSON	, and others .

		The early part of the third volume contains numerous engravings after
Marshall	PERSON	,
Lombart	LOCATION	, and
Faithome	LOCATION	; in the later pages we are among
Rowlandson	PERSON	's broad designs and the delicate fancies of
Stothard	PERSON	.

		From the time of
Sterne	PERSON	and
Goldsmith	PERSON	onwards use has occasionally been made of contemporary caricatures .

		In the fourth volume , although the illustrated record may not be so picturesque , yet the abundance and variety of the material will be found to have enabled the publishers to render this volume no less attractive than its predecessors .

		A History of English Literature which aims to be scrupulously exact , and yet attractive and amusing .

		With this view before them , the authors of this illustrated record , who have given a life-study to the movement and progress of English Literature , have prepared this history on entirely new lines .

		BRIEFER MENTION 406 NOTES 407 LIST OF NT : W books 408 A SECOND-BATE NOVELIST .

		The amusing Tolume in which Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne has parodied a number of his fellow - craftsmen in verse -LRB- not forgetting himself in the sport -RRB- describes the second Lord Lytton as '' a seventh-rate poet . ''

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's tendency to exaggerate is well-known , and he is probably too severe in this instance , as he is undoubtedly too eulogistic in others that might be mentioned .

		But we trust that we do the father of this '' seventh-rate poet , '' the first Lord Lytton , no injustice in describing him as a second-rate novelist .

		Although for many years he vied in popularity with his great con - temporaries ,
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, it was hardly claimed for him even during his life - time that he belonged to their class , and the quarter-century that has elapsed since his death has certainly done nothing to enhance his rep - utation .

		In fact , we are inclined to think that he has been unduly scorned by the critics of these later years , when there have been found none so poor to do him reverence , and that he is deserving of a better word than is commonly spoken in his behalf .

		The weeks just past have found us so oc - cupied in celebrating our
Emerson	LOCATION	centenary that sight has been lost , in large measure , of the fact that the same year and month marked the Bulwer centenary as well .

		It seems worth while , before the occasion has slipped from us altogether , to take a glance backward , and to ask what can honestly be said about the brill - iant English novelist in whom our youth de - lighted , and whose name looms so large in the literary annals of the mid - Victorian period .

		When
Bulwer	PERSON	died , in
1873	DATE	, it seemed to the larger part of the reading public as if one of the greatest contemporary figures had passed away .

		The conservative pages of Chambers 's ''
Cyclo	PERSON	- paedia of English Literature '' offer as the fol - lowing surprising statement : '' The sudden death of
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	was mnch re - gretted .

		He was at the head of our literature , with the single exception of Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	; his worki wet `` popular orer all
Europe	LOCATION	, and his fertility and industry seemed unabated . ''

		Between such an opinion as this and the opinion now current in critical circles , the contrast is striking indeed ; and the present underestimate seems to us almost as far re - moved from the truth as was the overestimate of a generation ago .

		It is easy enough to find flaws in
Bulwer	LOCATION	's work , and even faults of the most glaring na - ture must be allowed .

		His pretentiousness , his affectation of omniscience , and his constant re - sort to tricky rhetorical devices , make him an easy mark for the microscopic critic .

		Even the critic who concerns himself only with the larger aspects of literary art must recognize the fact that
Bulwer	PERSON	's whole method is artificial , and that he rarely achieves either the creation of 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, character or the presentatiou of vital truth .

		But when all these perfectly obvious excep - tions to his work have been taken , there is still a residuum of artistic ability and impressive intellectual force that calls for our admiration , and makes good his claim to respectable rank among the secondary names of our modern lit - erature .

		The extraordinary industry of
Bulwer	PERSON	is one of his most notable characteristics .

		For over fifty years he was a producer of books , and the mere list of their titles is imposing .

		Some of the books were poor enough , no doubt ; but scattered through the list , both early and late , we find works that still hold their place in our literature , and still command the interest of readers not altogether devoid of the critical sense .

		And his versatility was no less re - markable than his industry .

		That he was lack - ing in the originality of the greatest writers , must be admitted ; but it must also be admitted that few have equalled him in the faculty for adapting the manners and the methods of other writers without making himself imitative and nothing more .

		A whole series of his earlier novels is flavored with Byronism , but they are Byronic with a difference .

		The historical novels have learned much from
Scott	PERSON	, yet they have a distinctive character of their own , which is marked by its vices as well as by its virtues .

		In his three central novels of English life , we find the influence , now of
Sterne	PERSON	, now of
Dick	PERSON	- ens , now of Thackeray ; but the type is com - posite , and the ingenious eclecticism of these works excites our admiration .

		In other groups of novels , the author was more completely him - self , particularly in those tales which have a fantastic or supernatural basis , and in those which give the freest expression to the deeply - felt sentimentalism which was , for good or evil , the dominant trait in his composition .

		The works of fiction produced by Bulwer number altogether about two dozen titles .

		We may without great difficulty select from this list an even dozen of works that fairly represent his varied powers , and that deserve to outlive at least one more generation .

		Our list is as follows : ''
Pelham	PERSON	, '' as typical of his earlier satirical and Byronic manner ; ``
Eugene Aram	PERSON	, '' as an example of rhetorical melodrama ; '' The Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	, '' ''
Rienzi	PERSON	, '' '' The Last of the Barons , '' and ''
Harold	PERSON	, '' as the four historical romances , not one of which can be spared ; '' The Caxtons , '' '' My Novel , '' and '' What Will He Do with It ? ''

		the most typical of the novels proper ; ''
Zanoni	PERSON	, '' for its characteristic blend of history , romantic feeling , and supernaturalism ; '' The Parisians '' and ''
Kenelm Chillingly	PERSON	, '' as illustrating his peculiar vein of sentimentalism and his ripest philosophy .

		The assiduous reader of the ephe - meral fiction now being produced and devoured from day to day might do worse than abstain for a season from his favorite recreation , and devote a few weeks to the reading , or re-reading , of the dozen books that have just been named .

		They do not offer the perennial refreshment to be got from Scott and
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, but they do very appreciably dwarf the crea - tions of our present-day purveyors of Active entertainment , besides affording a considerable msight into the history of culture as reflected by a singularly acute and sympathetic mind .

		Thus far in this brief summary no word has been said of
Bulwer	LOCATION	's writings in other fields than that of fiction .

		Of his serious prose , there is much that is well worth reading , particularly his early descriptive papers styled ''
England	LOCATION	and the English , '' his charming essays called ''
Caxtoniana	PERSON	, '' and his ''
Athens	LOCATION	, '' a work of combined history , philosophy , and literary criti - cism , which , while open enough to the attack of scholarship , has nevertheless a quality of contagious enthusiasm that commends it to all generous minds .

		Bulwer as a poet was less suc - cessful than as a writer of prose , and his ambi - tious epics and satires fall distinctly under the Horatian ban .

		They are not likely ever again to be read for their own sake .

		Here , however , we must except the translations from
Schiller	PERSON	, which deserve high praise .

		And here also we must make a sort of exception in favor of '' The Lady of
Lyons	PERSON	'' and `` Richelieu . ''

		If we do not exactly read these dramas , we may still witness their stage performance with a certain satisfaction .

		Generous youth is still thrilled by
Claude Melnotte	PERSON	's description of the palace of his dreams , and the maturer sense finds it hard to remain quite unmoved when the hero flings down the money in the closing scene , and declares , '' There 's not a coin that is not bought and hallow 'd In the cause of nations with a soldier 's blood . ''

		As for '' Richelieu , '' the play still holds its place on the boards , and deserves it .

		The author no more gives us the Richelieu of history than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	gives us the historical
Brutus	PERSON	, but the piece is none the less effective for that .

		It is stagey in construction and rhetorical in dic - tion , but its points are made with an unerring dramatic instinct , and its best passages remain fixed in our memory whether we like them or
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		898 not .

		And the best of these best passages come surprisingly near to being good poetry , -- as near , on the whole , as the author ever ap - proached to that distinction .

		The poetic lit - erature of the nineteenth - century English drama is avowedly written for the closet , and it is no small achievement to have produced the one work of this species that seems likely , oat of a whole century 's output , to remain a valued contribution to the repertory of the theatre .

		A NEGLECTED ENGLISH CLASSIC . ''

		My brother was born for the benefit of knaves , '' said
Charles Wesley	PERSON	, alluding to the rare simplicity of
John Wesley	PERSON	's nature , a simplicity that made it impossible for him not only to tell an antrnth , bat ev `` n to keep a secret or to practice the slightest dis - simulation .

		It is this tone of absolute simplicity and genaineness that gives his Joornal its pecaliar charm .

		This bi-centennial year of
Wesley	ORGANIZATION	's birth -LRB- Jane 17 , 1703 -RRB- calls attention anew to that little-read and , in its unabridged form , somewhat forbidding work of literature .

		To us Americans , the writer should be an object of additional interest by reason of his early ministry in
Georgia	LOCATION	and the pnblieation -LRB- in
1737	DATE	-RRB- of his first hymn-book at
Charlestown	LOCATION	.

		The amazing extent of Wesley 's annual travels , within the British isles , give to bis recorded obser - vations a variety and range that one would by no means expect in the diary of a Methodist preacher .

		It is indeed , as Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	has said , a book full of plots and plays and novels , qaivering with life and crammed full of character .

		To his '' never travel - ing lees , by sea or land , than 4500 miles a year , '' to his `` constantly rising at four for about fifty years , '' and to his '' generaUy preaching at five in the
morning	TIME	, one of the most healthy exercises in the world , '' he attributed the increasing bodily vigor he enjoyed up to almost the very end .

		It is amus - ing to read , in terms that might apply to moral delinquency , his censure of the laxity in some of his societies about daily morning preaching -- at five o'clock ' .

		When it is pleaded that * ' the people will not come -- at least , not in the winter , '' he declares the Methodists to be a fallen people , and that '' with - out early rising neither their souls nor their bodies can long remain in health . ''

		The above-named min - imum of
Wesley	LOCATION	's yearly travel was nearly always largely exceeded , and he made it a rule to preach at least nine times a week .

		Yet with all this ac - tivity be found time to keep up , and to publish voluminous extracts from , his Journal , and also to issue tracts , hymns , letters , sermons , Bible com - mentaries , controversial papers , a church history , and we know not how much beside .

		His untiring industry excites our admiration , but still more do we applaud his courage , moral and physical , as we follow the record of it in the simple and modest language of the Journal .

		Beset by an angry mob in
Staffordshire	LOCATION	, he bears unmoved the threatening cries of '' Bring out the minister !

		We will have the minister ! ''

		This slender little preacher 's power to quell such disturbances is illustrated by what fol - lowed on this occasion .

		He writes in his diary : '' I desired one to take their eaptain bj the hand and bring him into the bouse .

		After a few sentences tntercban ^ d be - tween ns , the lion was become a lamb .

		I desired him to go oat and bring one or two more of the most angry of his com - panions .

		He braoght in two who were ready to swallow the ground with rage , bnt in two minat `` s they were as calm a > he .

		I then bade them make way that I might go out imnt the people .

		As soon as I was in the midst of them , I eallad for a chair , and standing np , asked , ' What do any of yon want with me ? '

		Some said . '

		We want yon to go with as to the
Justice	ORGANIZATION	. '

		I replied , ' That 1 will , with all my heart . '

		I then spoke a few words which Ood applied ; ao that they cried out with might and main , ` The gentleman is an honest gen - tleman , and we will spill our blood in his defense . ' ''

		The sustaining power of high ideals and a lofty purpose is nowhere better illustrated than in
Wes	LOCATION	- ley 's arduous , eventful , and often perilous career .

		Even the basest could not fail to recognize in him a man of God .

		One rnflSan who bad raised his hand to deal him a savage blow , let it fall gently on the preacher 's head , and , stroking his hair , exclaimed , '' What soft hair he has ! ''

		The ringleader of a mob that threatened to knock out the Methodist 's brains , had only to hear him pray , and was straight - way converted to a better mind . ''

		Sir , '' he ex - claimed , `` I will spend my life for you .

		Follow me , and no one shall hurt a hair of your head . ''

		So he was rescued with the loss merely of one dap of his waistcoat and a little skin from one hand .

		His patient endurance , we might almost say hi '' enjoyment , of physical discomfort of the extremest sort , comes out here and there in the Journal in some brief and modest mention of bodily hardship .

		Thus , setting out with a friend and a guide from
Savannah	LOCATION	for Cowpen , in late
December	DATE	, he lost his way .

		The three men waded through a cypress swamp , breast deep , and were then forced to pass the night in the wilderness without food or fire .

		The ground was as wet as their clothes , which , a sharp frost coming on , were soon frozen stiff . ''

		However , '' says
Wes	PERSON	- ley , '' I slept till six in the
morning	TIME	.

		There fell a heavy dew in the
night	TIME	, which covered us over as white as snow . ''

		The alleged hurtfulness of rains and dews in
America	LOCATION	he calls a vulgar error due to '' the softness of a genteel education . ''

		In the course of his travels by boat , he briefly records that one night he waked under water , being so fast asleep that he did not realize where he was until his mouth was full , when he managed to cast off his cloak and swim to a place of safety , with no further hurt than the wetting of his clothes .

		Showing the calmest of demeanor in the very face of death , he yet bitterly upbraids himself for his unwillingness to die .

		His voyage to
America	LOCATION	was stormy in the extreme , and occupied three and one-half months in late fall and winter .

		Of one storm he writes : 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, '' About nine the sea broke over ns from stem to stern ; burst througb the windows of the state cabin , where three or four of ns were , and covered us all over , though a bureau sheltered me from the main shock .

		About eleven I lay down in the great cabin , and in a short time fell asleep , though Tery uncertain whether I should wake alive , and much ashamed of my unwillingness to die .

		O , how pure in heart must be he who would rejoice to appear before God at a moment 's warning ! ''

		And later , he exclaims : '' 1 who will deliver me from this fear of death ?

		What shall I do ?

		Where shall I fly from it ?

		Should I fight against it by thinking , or by not thinking of it ?

		A wise man advised me some time since , ' Be still and go on . '

		Perhaps this is best , to look upon it as my cross ; when it comes , to let it humble me , and quicken all my good resolutions , especially that of praying without ceasing ; and at other times to take no thought about it , but quietly to go on ' in the work of the Lord . ' ''

		His bed being drenched by an influx of water , he made the discovery that the bare floor served excel - lently as a couch , and thereafter believed he should not find it necessary '' to go to bed -LRB- as it is called -RRB- any more . ''

		This equanimity amid all sorts of bod - ily discomfort and danger was perhaps one of the good results of his mother 's careful training of her boys '' to cry softly . ''

		Wesley 's good-humor under vituperation was ad - mirable , even in the earliest years of his ministry .

		One of his
Savannah	LOCATION	parishioners told him flatly , '' I like nothing you do , '' and then gave a list of the preacher 's supposed misdemeanors , both pri - vate and public , concluding with the assertion that no one minded a word he said , and that nobody would come to hear him . ''

		He was too warm for hearing an answer , '' says
Wesley	PERSON	, after setting down these grave charges against himself ; `` so I had nothing to do but to thank him for his openness , and walk away . ''

		The turbulence attending
Wesley	PERSON	's religious meet - ings reminds one of the disorder that so often broke up our anti-slavery gatherings .

		At one time it is an ox that the ill-intentioned try to drive into and through the open-air assembly of worshippers .

		But the good ox , after turning this way and that in manifest reluctance to disturb the meeting , faces about and breaks through the company of his driv - ers , and so runs away , leaving the Methodists re - joicing and praising God .

		At another time it is a shower of stones that endangers the lives of the faithful , until the leader of the rioters is brought before
Wesley	PERSON	, and , struck by something mightier than a stone , falls on his knees and implores heav - en 's forgiveness for his misdoings .

		Still again , the preacher is violently pushed from a wall he has mounted , but alights on his feet and delivers an expostulation to his tormentors , who thereupon be - come milder , and they and the minister part very civilly .

		An attempt is made on another occasion to overturn the table that serves him as a platform ; and after he has finished speaking many try to throw him down ; but he passes through the midst and so leaves them .

		That he was a special object of divine protection amid countless perils , he firmly believed , as also that God again and again intervened to revive his flagging energies when bodily weakness and fatigue seemed to make preaching impossible .

		He delights to record strange and , to him , marvellous events in connection with his preaching . ''

		An odd circum - stance , '' he writes , '' occurred during the morning preaching .

		It was well only serious persons were present .

		An ass walked gravely in at the gate , came up to the door of the house , lifted up his head , and stood stock-still , in a posture of deep at - tention .

		Might not ' the dumb beast reprove ' many who have far less decency , and not much more un - derstanding ? ''

		His credulity in certain matters amounted to superstition .

		Not only did he believe in witchcraft , but he deeply regretted the dying out of this belief in others . ''

		The English in general , '' he says , '' and indeed most of the men of learning in
Europe	LOCATION	, have given up all accounts of witches and apparitions .

		I am sorry for it ; and I will - ingly take this opportunity of entering my solemn protest against the violent compliment which so many that believe in the
Bible	LOCATION	pay to those that do not believe in it . ''

		It is pleasant to read of
Wesley	LOCATION	's and
Johnson	PERSON	's appreciation of each other 's worth .

		`` That great man '' is the preacher 's designation of his illustrious contemporary .

		They were each acute and skilful in discourse , and this point of similarity it may have been that reconciled them to each other 's less con - genial qualities ; for two men more unlike in genius could hardly be imagined .

		We may remark inci - dentally a common disapproval of certain attributes of the Scotch character .

		Wesley writes of a meet - ing held by him in Dundee : '' Poor and rich at - tended .

		Indeed , there is seldom fear of wanting a congregation in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		But the misfortune is , they know everything : so they learn nothing . ''

		In illustration of
Wesley	ORGANIZATION	's aptness of retort in argu - ment , we have his record of a good churchman 's coming to him with an exhortation not to leave the established church , and not to use extemporary prayer , which the churchman demonstrated to be no prayer at all . ''

		For you can not do two things at once .

		But thinking how to pray , and praying , are two things .


Ergo	ORGANIZATION	, you can not both think and pray at once . ''

		To which the other 's fitting re - joinder was : '' Now may it not be proved by the self-same demonstration , that praying by a form is no prayer at all ?

		You can not do two things at once .

		But reading and praying are two things .


Ergo	ORGANIZATION	, you can not both read and pray at once .

		Q. E. D. '' The chief charm of Wesley 's Journal lying in its style , let us go to his own writings for a description of it .

		He writes to a young friend : '' What is it that constitutes a good style 1 Perspicuity , purity , propriety , strength , and easiness joined together ... As for me , I never think of my style at all , but just set down the words that come first ... Clearness , in particular , is neces - sary for you and me , because we are to instruct people of the lowest understanding .

		We should constantly use the most common , little , easy words -LRB- so they are pure and proper -RRB- which our language affords .

		Bnt when I talked to plain people in the castle or the tows I obserTed they gaped and stared .

		This qnickly obliged me to alter my style , and adopt the language of those I spoke to .

		And yet there is a dignity in this simplicity , which is not disagreeable to thoae of the highest rank . ''

		In a word , then , it is the childlike qaality in
Wesley	LOCATION	that attracts -- the qaality mthoat which , we are taaght , one can not enter into the kingdom of heaven .

		His Joarnal breathes an artless enthasiasm that is in striking contrast with the smug self-com - placency of eighteenth-century literature as we have elsewhere learned to know it .

		Wesley takes ns out among the common people and shows us what they are doing and thinking and suffering .

		Finally , we can not do better than to nrge , with
Edward Fitz	PERSON	- Grerald : '' If yon do n't know it -LSB- the Journal -RSB- , do know it ... It is remarkable to read pure , unaf - fected , undying English , while

		A Ke-discovered Poet .

		`` A new poet is always wonderful , but a poet lost these two hundred and fifty years , now re-discovered and found to have spoken words vivid and warm with meaning for our genera - tion , -- this is more wonderful still .

		Yet this is what has been given us to behold in the stately and artfully antique-appearing volume in which Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	and his friends have set forth the poetical works of
Thomas Traherne	PERSON	.

		To the short list of mid-seventeenth century lyrists , --
Vaughan	PERSON	,
Herbert	PERSON	,
Crashaw	PERSON	, -- must now be added the name of this other poet of the gentle life .

		And what a pretty book-lover 's romance is the story of the finding and identification of this poet 's work !

		In the
winter of 1896	DATE	, Mr.
W. T. Brooks	PERSON	found the manuscript on a book - stall , that last resting-place of dead thought before the absolute oblivion of the waste-paper mills .

		They were communicated to the late Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	, who concluded that they were poems of
Henry Vaughan	PERSON	, and prepared for the press an edition of
Vaughan	ORGANIZATION	to include the new - found treasures .

		Dr.

Dobell	PERSON	.

		He came to doabt
Vaughan	PERSON	's authorship on account of the ever - present quality of '' passionate fervour of thought and intense ardour of enthusiasm '' in the new poems .

		Then began a run of expert editing and lucky coincidences through the treasure-house of the British Museum library , unearthing certain proofs of the authorship .

		The ascertained facts concerning
Traherne	PERSON	's life are few .

		He was born seemingly of Welsh ancestry , in
1636	DATE	or `` 37 , in
Hereford	LOCATION	or Led - bury ,
England	LOCATION	.

		His father was a shoe-maker and of poor estate , though other branches of the family seem to have been more prosperous .

		The poet was educated at
Brasenose College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, receiving his Bachelor 's degree in
1656	DATE	, Master 's in
1661	DATE	, and that of
Bachelor of Divinity	ORGANIZATION	in
1669	DATE	.

		He became an ardent minister and defender of the Church of En - gland , was rector of Credenbill , and finally was brought to
London	LOCATION	as chaplain to Sir
Orlando Bridgman	PERSON	, Lord Keeper of the Seals -LRB- 1667 -RRB- .

		In his patron 's house at
Teddington	LOCATION	the poet died ,
October , 1674	DATE	, and was buried under the reading-desk in
Teddington	LOCATION	church .

		Traherne published , in
1673	DATE	, `` Soman For - geries , '' an attack upon alleged errors of the Roman Church , exhibiting wide knowledge of church antiquities and of the writings of the
Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The year after his death , friends published his ''
Christian Ethicks	PERSON	, '' a notable volume of most modern and unconventional thinking .

		In
1699	DATE	the Rev.
George Hickes	PERSON	sent to the press a little book of devotions by
Traherne	PERSON	, called '' A Serious and Pathetical Contemplation of the Mercies of God . ''

		It is an interesting mingling of quotations , para - phrases , and imitations of the Psalms , but with many modern images and specifications and long lists of individual items and examples of things and acts for which he gives thanks .

		The
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		in Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	's hands consist of the poems here published and a remarkable book of essays called '' Centuries of Meditations , '' which the editor promises to bring out .

		We may anticipate this eagerly when we read the following as an example of its worth .

		The Men !

		O what venerable and reverend creatures did the aged seem !

		Immortal cherubim !

		And young men glittering and sparkling angels , and maids strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty !

		Boys and girls tumbling in the street were moving jewels : I knew not that they were born or should die . ''

		A third volume contains the poet 's `` private religious meditations , devotions , and prayers . ''

		Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	conjectures that we have not more than half of
Traherne	PERSON	's poems , and offers us a slight hope that the remainder will some day be found .

		Traherne is a religious lyric poet , who in the iron age of religious controversy and bit - terness kept open a
spring	DATE	of clear and limpid expression of universal , kindly piety .

		In him we seem to have that rarest and most precious combination -- passionate religious emotion with the genuine artistry of song .

		In subject matter he most nearly resembles
Herbert	PERSON	, and in style the more vigorous work of
Cowley	ORGANIZATION	, while with these others he continues the poetic traditions of
Donne	PERSON	.

		His limitations are many and pronounced , and he shows the inevitable faults of all religious verse -- few themes , the tiresome use of abstractions and general ideas , dogmatic mysticism , constant exclamations without added imagery or subtle analysis .

		But his expression is astonishingly free , spon - taneous , natural ; we have no conceits , and the collocations due to verse are obvious and not wearisome .

		Perhaps the most immediate surprises in
Traherne	PERSON	are his striking anticipations of
Blake	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	in his portrayals of the feelings of little children over the glorious earth they inherit , and of Whitman in his poetic catalogues and his delight in the brave goings-on of the worlds of men and na - ture .

		In his '' Christian Ethicks ''
Traherne	PERSON	says that others will point out the duty and the ex - pediency of obeying God 's laws and revering His universe , but that he will undertake to show how beautiful it all is , how full of joy is life lived in religious faith .

		His entire poetry is a specific enlargement upon this theme , but full of imagery based upon observation of life 's rich detail , and of psychology derived not so much from religious philosophy and ancient Hebrew thought as from religious feeling aris - ing in the presence of the actual world of men and things .

		It is difficult to quote enough from the longer religious poems to give a fair view of them , but their tenor may be seen in this sum - mary from the '' Serious and Pathetical Con - templation '' -LRB- 1699 -RRB- : '' I give thee thanks for the beauty of colours , for the harmony of sounds , for the pleasantness of odors , for the sweetness of meats , for the warmth and soft - ness of our raiments , and for all my five senses , and all the pores of my body , so curiously made as before recited , and for the preservation as well as use of my limbs and senses , in keeping me from precipices , frac - tures , and dislocations in my body , from a distracted , discomposed , confused , discontented spirit . ''

		On account of this primary religious con - viction ,
Traherne	PERSON	loves this earthly life , pas - sionately and entire , -- his body , the goodly earth , life 's activities , especially the common ways of men .

		He sees no ugliness in it except what is made by man 's choice of evil . ''

		A disentangled and a naked sense A mind that 's unpossest , A disengaged breast .

		An empty and a quick intelligence Acquainted with the golden mean , An even spirit pure and serene .

		Is that where beauty , excellence , And pleasure keep their court of residence : My soul retire .

		Get free , and so thou shalt even all admire . ''

		The Preparation .

		In '' The Vision , '' he exclaims : '' Even trades themselves seen in celestial light .

		And cares and sins and woes are bright . ''


Wordsworth	PERSON	said that the senses in their purity '' own an intellectual charm . ''

		See this interesting anticipation : '' and every sense Was in me like to some intelligence . ''

		Nature .

		How modern seem words like these from '' The Demonstration '' : `` Nothing 's truly seen that 's mean : Be it a sand , an acorn , or a bean .

		It must be clothed with endless glory , Before its perfect story -LRB- Be the spirit ne'er so clear -RRB- Can in its causes and its ends appear . ''

		This delight in life may well be seen in the following passionate lines from '' The Person '' : '' Ye sacred limbs , A richer blazon I will lay On you than first I found : That like celestial kings Ye might with ornaments of joy Be always crown 'd .

		A deep vermillion on a red , On that a searlet I will lay ; With gold I 'll crown your head .

		Which like the sun shall ray .

		With robes of glory and delight I '11 make you bright .

		Mistake me not , I do not mean to bring New robes , but to display the Thing : Nor paint , nor clothe , nor crown , nor add a ray , But glorify by taking all away . ''

		THE DIAL 897 , But it is , I think , in his analysis of his feelings as a little child and his religious en - thusiasm over a child 's innocence , its intimate understanding of Nature and God , its protec - tion from man 's sin and care until its impres - sions of nature are fixed , that
Traherne	PERSON	is at his best .

		It is the subject matter of full half of his verse . ''

		These little limbs These eves and hands which here I find .

		These rosy cheeks wherewith my life begins , Where have ye been ?

		Behind What curtain were ye hid so long , Where was , in what abyss , my speaking tongue ?

		Such sacred treasures are the limbs of boys , In which a soul doth dwell ; Their organized joints and azure veins More wealth include than all the world contains . ''

		The Salutation . ''

		How like an angel came I down !

		How bright are all things here !

		When first among his works I did appear , O , how their glory me did crown !

		The world resembled his Eternity In which my soul did walk ; And everything that I did see Did with me talk . ''

		The streets were paved with golden stones .

		The boys and girls were mine ; O , how did all their lovely faces shine !

		The sons of men were holy ones .

		In joy and beauty they appeared to me .

		And everything which here I found .

		Which like an angel I did see .

		Adorned the ground . ''

		Wonder .

		Would not
Wordsworth	PERSON	have rejoiced over lines like these ?

		■ ■ I knew not that there was a serpent 's sting Whose poison shed On men , did overspread The world : nor did I dream of such a thing As sin , in which mankind lay dead .

		They all were brisk and living wights to me , Tea , pure and full of immortality . ''

		Eden .

		And would not
Blake	PERSON	have been glad to own this ? ''

		A joyful sense and purity Is all I can remember , The very night to me was bright , ' T was
summer	DATE	in
December	DATE	. ''

		Innocence .

		The following lines from '' Dumbness '' might be transferred without change to '' The Prelude , '' and would be in harmony with their surroundings : '' Sure man was bom to meditate on things , And to contemplate the eternal springs Of God and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, glory , bliss , and pleasure .

		That life and love might be bis heavenly treasure ; And therefore speechless made at first , that be Might in himself profoundly busied be : And not vent out , before he bath ta'en in Those antidotes that guard his soul from sin . ''

		■ ■ For nothing spoke to me but the fair face Of heaven and earth , before myself could speak .

		I then my bliss did , when my silence break . '' ''

		Then did I dwell within a world of light .

		Distinct and separate from all men 's sight .

		When I did feel strange thoughts , and such things see That were , or seem 'd , only reveal 'd to me . '' ''

		The first impressions are immortal all . ''

		I wish I could quote the entire poem '' On News , '' whose theme is the participation of the child in everything he hears or sees .

		I have room for this only : '' News from a foreign country came .

		As if my treasure and my wealth lay there So much it did my heart inflame ! '

		T was wont to call my soul into my ear Which thither went to meet The approaching sweet .

		And on the threshold stood .

		To entertain the unknown good .

		It hovered there As if ' t would leave mine ear , And was so eager to embrace The joyful tidings as they came , T would almost leave its dwelling place , To entertain that same . ''

		Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	rightly emphasizes
Traherne	PERSON	's unexpected idealism , -- judging him another
Berkeley	LOCATION	before that philosopher 's day .

		One certainly starts to read lines so filled with in - tuitive ideas as these : `` My naked simple life was I ; That out so strongly shined Upon the earth , the sea , the sky .

		It was the substance of my mind ; The sense itself was I. I felt no dross nor matter in my soul , No brims nor borders , such as in a bowl We see .

		My essence was Capacity , That felt all things ; The thought that springs Therefrom 's itself .

		It hath no other wings To spread abroad , nor eyes to see , Nor hands distinct to feel .

		Nor knees to kneel ; But being simple like the Deity In its own centre as a sphere .

		Not shut up here , but everywhere . ''

		< ■ I could not tell Whether the things did then Themselves appear .

		Which in my spirit truly seem 'd to dwell ; Or whether my conforming mind Were not even all that therein shin 'd . ''

		My Spirit .

		From
Traherne	PERSON	's `` Serious and Pathetical Contemplation , '' Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	selects the one 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, really good example of similarity to the work of Whitman , but this is sufficiently like to cause us to wonder .

		The poet is speaking of '' the children of my people , '' '' my lovely companions '' : '' Do not they adorn and beautify the world , And gratify my soul which hateth solitude !

		Thou , Lord , hast made this servant a sociable crea - ture , for which I praise thy name .

		A lover of company , a delighter in equals ; Replenish the inclination which Thyself hath im - planted , And give me eyes To see the beauty of that life and comfort Wherewith those of their actions Inspire the nations .

		Their Markets , Tillage , Courts of Judicature , Marriages , Feasts and Assemblies ,
Navies	ORGANIZATION	, Armies , Priests and
Sab	ORGANIZATION	- baths , Trades and Business , the voice of the Bridegroom ,
Musical Instruments	ORGANIZATION	, the light of Candles , and the grinding of
Mills	LOCATION	, are comfortable , O Lord , let them not cease . ''

		Truly a poet of the gentle life !

		He is religious , but not dogmatic , not a quietist ; a mystic , but given neither to whims nor para - doxes .

		He does not make us worldly-wise , or expert in '' the sad discussion of sin . ''

		But he refreshes our dulled sense of the beauty of liv - ing , he moves us without exciting our passions -LRB- as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	said -RRB- , he makes us respond to '' the dear love of comrades , '' and he particu - larly makes shine again the beauty in '' life 's familiar face '' and in childhood .

		Like another
Wordsworth	PERSON	, he is an unobtrusive but sure '' friend of the wise and teacher of the good . ''

		I have not done justice to Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	's lit - erary skill in identifying
Traherne	PERSON	's work , nor can I overpraise his enthusiastic analysis of the poet 's merit .

		One could only wish that his Introduction had been freed from the large amount of relevant but commonplace critical and other personal moralizing .

		Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	has undoubtedly done us a real service , and has enabled us to add several fine numbers to our classic poetic anthology .

		The Monarch in
England	LOCATION	.

		* Probably no relation of an English monarch in the present day has so much interest for the public as that of the monarch toward ministe - rial and parliamentary government .

		Probably , too , there is no point upon which there is so much misconception and such a diversity of opinion , with much leaning toward the belief • QuBEN
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		A Biography .

		By
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		that the sovereign is a majestic figure-head , only nominally exercising functions which are actually controlled by the ministerial cabinet .

		For the American readers , at least , of Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's life of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, much in - terest will hinge upon the light thrown upon
Victoria	PERSON	in this important relation .

		English reviews of this book have commented with sur - prise upon the exceedingly limited influence exercised by the Queen on governmental affairs .

		On this side the water , however , the surprise will be that in certain directions
Victoria	PERSON	did actually exercise a powerful personal influence by virtue of her rights as monarch , even though , as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	points out in his con - cluding chapter , royal prerogative steadily de - clined throughout the course of her reign .

		Victoria entered upon her long reign with little apparent thought of the necessity of guarding royal prerogative .

		Her marriage to Prince
Albert	PERSON	gave her , early in her royal career , a counsellor implicitly trusted , whose first care was to understand thoroughly the constitutional position of his wife , and to insist that it should be wholly respected .

		Royal prerogative included the right of consultation upon all matters of state , and both the Queen and Prince
Albert	PERSON	were particularly interested in and determined to be consulted upon ques - tions of foreign policy .

		Preliminary to con - sultation with the ministers on such matters ,
Victoria	PERSON	had of course to be taken into the confidence of the foreign office , and important correspondence and despatches had to be laid open for her inspection .

		Such conferences and transmission of documents frequently in - volved delays sometimes unfortunate , and often irritating to the ministers .

		In the case of brusque ministers , like
Palmerston	LOCATION	, whose re - lations with the Queen were never wholly am - icable , the delay was sometimes resented , and occasionally the knowledge of important mat - ters pertaining to foreign affairs was withheld .

		In general , however , the attitude of the min - isters upon this question was one of compliance to the Queen 's request , especially when , as the years went on , her experience and wisdom came to be thoroughly respected .

		She was at no time exacting nor autocratic in insisting that her suggestions be acted upon ; it was merely the reiterated insistence upon being consulted , an insistence which was really effective .

		Many in - stances might be cited in which her suggested change of a phrase , or modification of a prin - ciple , had favorable results for English diplo - macy , but none is more famous , nor more
1903	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 399 interesting to Americans , than the alteration in
Palmerston	LOCATION	's despatch to
Washington	LOCATION	in the Trent affair , in the early days of the Civil War .

		At that time what would have been an offen - sive and insulting note was transformed by the Queen 's suggestion into a dignified asser - tion of the rights of British vessels , leaving to
America	LOCATION	the opportunity for a satisfactory explanation without national humiliation .

		Whether
Victoria	PERSON	's tact prevented war be - tween
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	or not , the inci - dent justified the Queen 's insistence upon the right of consultation on all matters of state .

		Another field in which
Victoria	PERSON	took a seri - ous view of her personal responsibilities was in regard to the distribution of Church pat - ronage .

		She emphatically objected to any po - litical partisanship in such matters , writing to Archbishop Benson in
1890	DATE	, in regard to the appointment of Bishops , '' The men to be chosen must not be taken with reference to satisfying one or the other party in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, or with reference to any political party , but for their real worth .

		We want people who can be firm and conciliatory , else the Church can not be maintained .

		We want large broad yiewa , or the difficulties will be insurmount - able . ''

		No minister had a greater share of the Queen 's personal liking than
Disraeli	LOCATION	; yet when , in
1868	DATE	, the Archbishopric of
Canter	PERSON	- bury became vacant , Disraeli found himself compelled by the stubborn resistance of the Queen to put aside his own preference , and consent to the nomination of the Queen 's choice ,
Tait	PERSON	, Bishop of
London	LOCATION	.

		Other min - isters throughout her reign bad the same expe - rience , and were forced to yield to the Queen 's claim to determine arrangements in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		She received advice from her ministers , but in this field did more than criticize and suggest , for she emphatically refused it .

		No statement is more commonly made than that an English ministry when defeated in the HoQse of Commons has two courses open to it : to dissolve Parliament and appeal to the coun - try , or to resign office ; and that the option rests entirely with the ministry .

		Yet Mr.
Lee	PERSON	shows us that
Victoria	PERSON	repeatedly throughout the early part of her reign exercised her personal choice in such circumstances .

		The right to do this was brought into notable prominence in
1868	DATE	, when
Disraeli	PERSON	, having suffered an adverse vote in the Commons , disclaimed any responsibil - ity for the Queen 's decision , asserting that he had given her no advice as to which course she should pursue .

		For this he was blamed by the opposition ; but a search for precedent revealed that he stood on wholly defensible ground .

		The incident , as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	states , '' served to bring into clearer relief than before the practical ascendancy within certain limits , which under the constitution a ministerial crisis assured the Crown , if its wearer cared to assert it .

		The revelation was in the main to the advantage of the prestige of the throne .

		It confuted the constitutional fallacy that the monarch was necessarily and invariably an automaton . ''

		In the same year ,
1868	DATE	, there occurred an excellent illustration of the importance and power of the monarch as a medium of con - ciliation and arbitration between conflicting opinions in the two
Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gladstone 's bill for the disestablishment of the
Irish Church	ORGANIZATION	was accepted by the Commons , but was threatened with rejection by the Lords , in which body the Bishops were then unusually active .

		The conflict seemed destined to assume the proportions of a constitutional struggle , when the Queen , always fearful of the effects of such crises , proposed on her personal initiative to attempt to effect a compromise .

		Gladstone gladly accepted her intervention , and her per - sonal influence with
Tait	PERSON	, Bishop of
London	LOCATION	, persuaded him into a conference with Glad - stone , with the result that
Victoria	PERSON	's sugges - tions were adopted and a satisfactory compro - mise was agreed upon .

		This , after great efforts and repeated pressure brought to bear by the Queen , was finally passed by both
Honses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1884	DATE	a similar crisis , this time concerned with a franchise bill proposing a wide extension of the suffrage , was averted by the wise intervention of
Victoria	LOCATION	, who , as before , acted without suggestion from her ministers .

		These few incidents , chosen from among many that might be cited , serve to show in a measure the importance and effectiveness which , in spite of the great limitations upon the exercise of prerogatives , still belong to the monarch in
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's biography is less concerned with such incidents , however , than with presenting a just and critical narra - tive of Victoria in her dual character of queen and woman .

		He emphasizes the perpetual English mistrust of the influence of Prince
Albert	PERSON	, the suspicion that
Victoria	PERSON	because of her marriage might sacrifice English to petty German interests , and the tardy recognition of the Princes merits long after his death in
1861	DATE	.

		He surprises us with his proof of the essentia -RSB- unpopularity of Victoria herself soon 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, after that date , an unpopularity due to her re - pugnance to appearing as the head of the state in public functions , while yet sincerely mourn - ing her husband .

		The irritation of the nation was constantly manifested by the press in the criticisms directed against what seemed an un - necessarily prolonged seclusion , and it was not until the Jubilee of
1887	DATE	that
Victoria	LOCATION	re - gained that public affection which had been lavished upon her in the first years of her reign .

		In every chapter is made clear the Queen 's constant solicitude for the prestige of her country , her dislike of war , yet her determina - tion that war once entered upon should not terminate until English honor had been satis - fied and English interests safeguarded .

		In - deed , her pride in
England	LOCATION	blinded her at times to both the horrors and the justice of war .

		Throughout the story of her life , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	is a careful , studious , and exact critic , yet a kindly one , and eminently fair both to
Victoria	LOCATION	her - self and to the men who advised her .

		His work is an excellent historical biography , in every way entertaining and readable .

		Besaxt 's Eighteenth-Century liONDON .

		* Ten years ago or more , Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	-LRB- for that was before he received the honors of knighthood -RRB- wrote a series of nine papers about
London	LOCATION	, which appeared first in a popular magazine and afterwards in book form .

		The book was of moderate size , and was obviously written with the tastes and fancies of the popu - lar mind in view .

		Nevertheless it was evident that its author was deeply interested in Lon - don , in its history , and in every phase of its profoundly significant life ; and that his knowl - edge thereof was not due merely to a familiar - ity with the `` surveys '' and histories that had been written from time to time ever since the
sixteenth century	DATE	, but was derived from inde - pendent excursions into a most attractive field of study .

		We now know the nine chapters of a decade ago to have been the mere diversion of a writer who had greater things in view ; as were also his book on Westminster , published in
1895	DATE	, and that on
South London	LOCATION	,
three years later	DATE	.

		They were of the nature of preliminary sketches for a far more ambitious work .

London	LOCATION	, as
Stowe	PERSON	was that of the sixteenth century .

		The work by which he most desired to be remembered by posterity was an early projected complete sur - vey of the city .

		Half his life-time had been devoted to active research , and to the collect - ing of maps , pictures , pamphlets , account books , parish registers , and novels and plays of different periods , -- of everything , in fact , that could throw light upon any phase of Lon - don life , -- all with his intended magnum opus always in view .

		But while Sir
Walter	PERSON	had secured the co - operation of certain experts in different de - partments of city life , he reserved for his own pen the general history of the city ; he expended on this task five years of continuous labor , and happily completed it before his lamented death in
1901	DATE	.

		From this general history , the portion relating to the eigh - teenth century , -- the period least satisfac - torily treated in the volume of ten years ago , -- has been selected for present publication .

		The result is a quarto of 610 pages , to which are added valuable appendices and an admirable index .

		The book is embellished with twenty - two full - page illustrations and eighty - one printed with the text , -- a full score of these being portraits , and all of them reproduced from contemporary prints .


Hogarth	PERSON	has been judiciously drawn upon to furnish illustrations , and Gay 's `` Trivia '' is frequently quoted in the text .

		Hence Sir
Walter	PERSON	's eighteenth century is ex - tended to the last named year , -- about which time , also , the passing of the Reform Bill , the beginning of railway travel on land and the introduction of steam-ships on the sea , as well as changes in the English Constitution , in the growth and extension of trade , in religious thought and in social standards , ushered in a new era , of which we think as often as we name the nineteenth century .

		THE DIAL 401 It is chiefly of manners and customs , and prevalent ideas , which changed but little be - tween
1700	DATE	and
1837	DATE	, that Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has written .

		Of the political changes that took place in the city government , he has taken but little notice .

		Under the head of '' Historical Notes , '' twenty historical episodes of the century and events of English history , supposed to belong peculiarly to
London	LOCATION	and to illustrate more particularly the civic spirit , have been selected and narrated .

		These are followed by seven chapters in which the topog - raphy and external appearance of the city are described .

		A third and fourth division of the book are devoted to the relation of the city to churches and chapels , and to government and trade .

		The remaining part of the book is de - voted to manners and customs , to society and amusements , and to crime , police , justice , and debtors ' prisons .

		To the author of '' All Sorts and Conditions of Men , '' the sociological phases presented in these later chapters had a peculiar fascination .

		He felt that the power and the unruly condi - tion of the
London	LOCATION	mob , which had steadily increased with the population and extent of the city , which became absolutely intolerable in the eighteenth century and presented the most troublesome problem connected with the order of the city , was one of the chief characteristics of the period .

		An efficient police was not es - tablished until the following century .

		If any fault is to be found with the book , it might be because , although the eighteenth century was the century of
Addison	PERSON	, of
Steele	PERSON	, of Pope , of
Goldsmith	LOCATION	, of
Johnson	PERSON	, of
Walpole	LOCATION	, and of
Sheridan	PERSON	, and was therefore peculiarly a century of literary interests , yet those interests receive no notice .

		But if from the author 's ex - planation that the literature of the eighteenth century is reserved for fuller treatment in con - nection with that of the centuries before and after , we are to imply that other portions of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's survey will be forthcoming in due time , we shall await with patience for a work upon
London	LOCATION	that will be completely satisfying .

		Wall Street and its Work .

		* It was just
thirty years ago	DATE	that
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	published his significant work on English trade and finance , entitled '' Lombard Street . ''

		At that time the deposits of known banks in
London	LOCATION	amounted to
$ 600,000,000	MONEY	; while in
New York	LOCATION	but one-third of this amount rested in the possession of banking houses .

		When
Bagehot	PERSON	wrote , every nation went to
London	LOCATION	for loans ; but to-day German bonds and English consols are floated in
New York	LOCATION	.

		While we can not say that Lombard Street is no longer powerful , it is , however , possible to declare that Wall Street is a potent factor in the finances of the world .

		A book upon `` The Work of Wall Street '' is therefore welcome , even if it does add to the half-score already in existence in its general field .

		The book of
Bagehot	PERSON	is a classic , broad and philosophical .

		Mr.
Pratt	PERSON	's book on Wall Street has been hampered somewhat by the limitations of the series to which it belongs .

		It has , however , gained in definiteness of description something of what it has lost in breadth and comprehensiveness .

		As a re - porter , the author has pictured the doings of '' the Street , '' and the machinery used in the handling of funds and the sales of stocks and bonds .

		The book opens with a chapter on '' The Evolution of Wall Street , '' which gives evidence of much patient research in books and records for elusive facts .

		Evolution has reference to the process of unfolding and the principles involved in such a process ; but this chapter is given over to a recital of incidents more or less connected with the history of Wall Street , with the result that the reader gets but a hazy notion of the evolution of this great financial centre .

		Beginning with Chapter II. , however , the author goes forward with more certainty of touch , as in clear and incisive lan - guage he unwinds the mysteries of '' the Street . ''

		Objection may be taken to the statement that the operations of the merchant and the speculator are essentially the same .

		The spec - ulator exists to-day because he performs a func - tion different from that of the merchant , and more particularly from that of the manufac - turer .

		He it is who assumes the risks of fluc - tuating prices , and relieves the producing agents of the uncertainty of the future .

		As Wall Street deals almost exclusively in stocks and bonds , the speculator operating there does not affect the industrial world in the highly important way that the same functionary does when dealing in grains , provisions , iron , coal , and other ma - terials .

		Perhaps Mr.
Pratt	PERSON	has unconsciously put the matter too favorably for the `` Wall Street '' trader , when he says : '' A market that has uo public is in a most unsatisfactory con - dition .

		Professionals can , and do , buy and sell among themselves ; but this is a process not un - like the ' swapping ' of horses between regular horse-traders .

		The public supplies the new interest in the Street , -- the fresh demand , the increased capital .

		We have already seen that about one-third of all the transactions repre - sents real buying or selling , outside of manip - ulation and room-trading .

		Of this one-third , the public interest is decidedly the most im - portant . ''

		The '' Street , '' after all , has its place as a capital accumulator and distributor ; but it performs this function together with the banks .

		When it goes beyond this , the stock exchange is perilously near the gambling point .

		Mr.
Pratt	PERSON	's book deals very briefly with the larger function of '' the Street , '' but describes admirably the exchange , the clearing-house , the money market , panics , and many other fea - tures of our American financial centre .

		In fact , it may be said , despite minor criticisms , that no other book so well fills this special field .

		story well , and there is no reason to doubt that the vivid and realistic pictures of factory life they pre - sent are fair and accurate .

		It may be suggested that these well-educated and well-nurtured women could not do justice to a subject so foreign to their natures as the life of the factory worker ; but it seems to me that in one sense they alone could do it justice , for only those who have known the best that this world offers can measure understandingly the deficiency in the lives of those who have to live upon the dregs .

		As
B. L. Stevenson	PERSON	found in his experiences as an amateur emigrant , so these ladies very soon discovered , that in proletarian clothes they were universally regarded as proletarians .

		Their manners did not '' give them away , '' though they made no attempt to change them , beyond the use of a certain amount of bad grammar .

		They found no fundamental difference between themselves and the women they came in contact with , and they write with the strong conviction that the hard and empty lives of the workers are far more the result of conditions imposed upon them than of anything inherent in their natures .

		Those who believe dif - ferently , and desire to prove that factory women have all they deserve , will point triumphantly to the many who are working rather for luxuries than for necessities ; who loudly proclaim that they '' do not have to work . ''

		If there appears to be any - thing reassuring about this class of cases , our complacency rapidly disappears upon closer ex - examination .

		If the girls ' ideals and standards are low , what has made them so but the society in which they live , the environment out of which they can not escape ?

		The desire to be independent , to count for something as an individual , is a meritorious one ; and if their notion of '' counting '' is to have good clothes , they are not altogether different from many of those whose opportunities should have taught them better .

		After all , they do but reach after what seems to them worth while , and are willing to suffer much for it , a proof at any rate of a certain kind of virtue .

		Moreover , it is not impossible that this virtue fre - quently has its reward , in marriage into a higher grade of society than that represented by the par - ental home .

		Surely , here we have proof of the existence of a great wealth of human energy , poten - tially endowed with the seeds of great good , but for the most part going to waste or worse , because of social and environmental conditions .

		It is no an - swer to say that the rich , who have everything in their favor , also many of them squander their lives .

		They likewise are blighted by circumstances , the condition of luxurious idleness being as unnatural as that of burdensome and never ending toil .

		So here we have two sets of people , the lives of one set spoiled so that those of the other set may be spoiled also .

		There are many passages one is tempted to quote , and I can not resist giving these from
Miss Van Vorst	ORGANIZATION	's chapter on `` The Child in

		Americans in Process '' is qaite a different sort of work .

		It is based npon years of investigation by settlement workers in

		Unfortunately for the general reader , much of it is presented almost in the form of a catalogue , and many of the facts are of local rather than universal interest .

		Parts of it remind one a little of a zoological monograph , which is fall of interest to anyone who has and is studying the creatures of which it treats , but other - wise a trifle dry .

		However , if the reader will per - severe as far as the sixth chapter , he will find in this and several chapters beyond a great deal which is noteworthy and suggestive to the citizen of any town , or any stadent of human nature .

		Particu - larly good are the descriptions of the two great political bosses , of the North and West Ends respec - tively ; of the contrast between the Italians and the Jews as shown by their holiday-making ; of the two dominant and contrasting religions , -- the Jewish and
Roman Catholic	ORGANIZATION	, with Protestantism hardly in evidence .

		The book is an outcome of the activities of those modern knights errant who fortunately exist in every great city , and we can not be too appreciative of the stand they have taken for the right .

		And as all roads lead to
Rome	LOCATION	, so we find ourselves again in the face of evidence proving the destruction of good human t & lent by unfavorable conditions .

		Thus on p. 374 : '' The Jewish race has an immemorial record as a prolific mother of genios .

		The Italian strain has historically ont - ttnpftA all others by being thrice -- once politically , teligioaaly , once intellectually , -- the dominating power of the world .

		Tet it is almost a matter of haphazard whether children of these races among na , who may be bom with the highest order of capacity , do aot have the spirit within them qnenched by a childhood apSBt ia dinaal , degrading streeu .

		Even after such caparity has hwgiiii distinctly to manifest itself , we are content oftea to throw it away by not - ' - ' ■ ^ t unfailing provision for neceaaaiy training and apprentaee - ahip . ''

		The author is apparently not a bi - ologist , but he reasons on biological subjects in a way that is simply astonishing to one who has any realization of the intricacies of that science ^ and seems to me to build elaborate arguments on doubt - ful or even erroneous assumptions .

		In '' most attractive little volume entitled '' A New Portrait of Shake - speare '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	, recently known as the author of a sprightly account of '' An American at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, '' has given ns some very interesting points in regard to the genuine - ness , or otherwise , of certain portraits of Shake - speare .

		The sub-title of the book is '' The Case of the Ely Palace Painting as against that of the So - called Droeshont Original . '' '

		and implies what Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	later states as the purpose of the discussion , • • to show that the so-called Droeshont Original is probably a fabrication , and that the Ely Palace paint - ing is probably a life-portrait of Shakespeare . ''

		Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	relates the history of these paintings , as well as those of the Droeshont Engraving prefixed to 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, the first folio in
1623	DATE	, and of the
Stratford	LOCATION	bust .

		Copies of all of these are given in full-page illus - trations , and much of Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	's discussion cen - tres around the details of costume and features as found in these pictures .

		Some surprising revelations are given in regard to the '' mock originals '' which were known to have been circulated by the dozens at one time or another .

		With the knowledge of such fraud , we can realize that any deductions in re - gard to a life-portrait of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must be based on the wisest methods of investigation and the most cautious acceptance of proofs .

		Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	seems to be well fitted for a work of this kind , and takes scientific and scholarly satisfaction in his investiga - tions .

		The
Ely Palace	ORGANIZATION	painting of Shakespeare was discovered in
1846	DATE	.

		For thirty-two years it hung neglected in the house where Shakespeare was born .

		The so-called
Droeshout Original	ORGANIZATION	has received exactly the opposite treatment , and has been repeatedly and warmly discussed .

		After carefully noting all the important opinions and discoveries of experts and historians in regard to these two portraits , together with his own deductions , Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	states his con - clusions as to what he considers established in the discussion , as follows : '' The Ely Palace portrait is not , as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	states , so different from the en - graving as ' to raise doubts as to whether the person represented could have been intended for Shake - speare ' ; but quite to the contrary , it has , of all the painted portraits except the spurious Droeshout ` Original , ' the strongest resemblance to the Droe - shout engraving .

		Granting that the Droeshout en - graving may not have been taken from the
Ely Palace	ORGANIZATION	portrait , it must have been taken from a portrait that in all essential points of features and costume was identical with it .

		Of all the painted por - traits , accordingly , the
Ely Palace	ORGANIZATION	portrait has the strongest claim to be regarded as a life-portrait . ''

W. Warvelle	PERSON	of the
Chicago	LOCATION	bar , entitled '' Essays in Legal Ethics '' -LRB-
Callaghan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		From the first appear - ance of the legal profession in English history , the barrister has been considered an integral part of the judicial system , as truly an assistant in the ad - ministration of justice as is the judge ; and although in this country the functions of barrister and solicitor are not distinguished , the conception has always prevailed that the practice of law must not degen - erate into a mere scramble for money , but that the lawyer has certain definable relations to both court and client that can not be stated in terms of the cash nexus .

		This view has been adopted by our legal tribunals , and is enforced by penalties ranging from reprimand to disbarment from practice .

		Thus a treatise on legal ethics is no mere collection of obiter dicta , but rather a statement of a code pos - sessing a widely acknowledged authority and at many points armed with the power to secure its own enforcement .

		This non-commercial element , which elevates the practice of law to the dignity of a profession , appears very clearly in the restrictions placed upon the attorney in his dealings with his client . ''

		In the relation of attorney and client , '' says the author , '' we find a reversal of many of the best settled rules of law with respect to contractual freedom , and the application of a rule of rigid mo - rality that practically precludes the attorney from assuming any position toward his client other than that of a disinterested and judicious adviser . ''

		The same underlying principles can be seen in the re - lations in which the lawyer is expected to stand to the community at large , to the court , and to his fel -

		The name of Mr.

		The illastra - tions , by Messrs.
Loois Agassiz Fuertes	PERSON	,
Charles Livingston Bull	PERSON	,
A. B. Frost	PERSON	, and others , are fre - quent and of excellent execution in technical and artistic details .

		This ample volume of 600 pages is a most valuable addition to this library .

		It in - cludes our most popular game birds , and will in - terest more sportsmen than any other volume in the series .

		Not only is it broad in scope , bat in literary execution it has reached the high-water mark among books of its class .

		The pleasing inter - ludes of anecdote and narrative add interest and enliven the pages , while the main subject itself is fully treated without excess of technical lingo or display of artful devices .

		After an introductory account of shooting from passes , over decoys , in the wild-rice fields , and from bush blinds , the au - thor gives his personal experiences with many of our water - fowl on a wide range of noted hunting grounds .

		As a remedy for the decrease in these wild-fowl , which has become so apparent in recent years , the anthor recommends a universal law throughout the
United States	LOCATION	against spring shoot - ing ; a limitation of exposure of game birds for sale in public markets to short seasons , if indeed at all ; a prohibition of all preservation of game in cold storage ; prevention of state exportation , and an individual limit to the number killed .

		The increase and g ^ eat tameness of these wild-fowl in our pro- tected
National Parks	ORGANIZATION	is recorded with approval .

		The greater part of the book is taken up with de - scriptions of individual game-birds , ducks , geese , swans , rails , snipe , and other shore birds , with many notes of interest to the sportsman and to the natur - alist .

		A synopsis for determination of the water - fowl closes the volume , well-planned and well wrought out into a comprehensive manual which will be a boon to every sportsman .

		Jfatyre-atudy in education .

		It is a large place in education which Professor Liberty
H. Bailey	PERSON	claims for '' The Nature-Study Idea '' -LRB- Dou - bleday .

		Page
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and a place , moreover , not held by any other subject in the school curriculum .

		It is not a mere adjunct to an already over-crowded coarse of study , bat a fundamental epoch-making movement which will touch the masses with a new educational impulse and bring a stronger and more resourceful life to the pupil led by this means into a fuller and more intimate sympathy with Nature and his environment .

		While all readers of this stimulating and suggestive book may not be so sanguine as the author in his hope that nature - study will relieve the school-room of perfunctory methods and of dessicated science , none will fail to see the promise for great effectiveness in this direction which this new view-point brings to pri - mary education .

		The thing itself , not the book about it , -- the living bobolink , not even the staffed specimen , -- the process of discovery , rather than the fact observed , -- these stamp the nature-study idea as revolutionary in educational methods .

		It is not science , but a method which has room for fancy and sentiment as well as fact , and its net result is a little knowledge and more love of Nature 's forms and an independent habit of seeing things intelli - gently as they really are .

		In this lies the solution of the agricultural problem , the spiritualizing of agricalture , and also the ground for a new ethics of sport with gun and rod and of man 's relations to other living things .

		Seekers for definite schedules of courses , specific directions for nature-study les - sons , or illustrations of matter and method , will be disappointed in Professor
Bailey	PERSON	's treatise ; but those who seek inspiration will find his pages breathing that spirit which gives life in all things .

		The first volume of the long-promised edition of '' The Poems of
Philip Freneaa	PERSON	, '' edited for the
Princeton Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	by Professor
Fred Lewis Pat	PERSON	- tee , has now been issued by the
Library of Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	-- the university of which Freneau was a graduate .

		It is a large , handsome octavo of some four hundred pages , and includes a careful intro - ductory study of the poet 's life and works ; early poems , 1768-1775 ; and the poems of '' the first poetic period , '' 1775-1781 .

		The editor has spared no pains to make an authoritative text ; in this effort he has had the assistance of Mr.
John Rogers	PERSON	Wil - liams , the general editor of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are numerous footnotes , mainly devoted to textual and bibliog ^ raphical details , bat also inclading Fre - neaa 's own annotations .

		The list of variant read - ings is very large , in consequence of the several revisions to which Freneaa subjected his poems .

		The f alness of the textual '' apparatus '' famished is illustrated by '' The Rising Glory of
America	LOCATION	, '' in which the edition of
1809	DATE	is followed , but the complete text of the now rare edition of
1772	DATE	is added at the foot of the page .

		The biographical sketch of Freneaa is admirable in every respect .

		The tone is fair and candid , and full justice is done to the character and genius of the poet ; while hero - worship does not blind the biographer to the faults which the poet certainly possessed , even though he shared them with his contemporaries .

		For example , he does not wholly exonerate Freneau in regard to the conduct of '' The National Gazette , '' but says that '' neither side is free from blame . ''

		-LSB-
June 16	DATE	, The meaning of picture * .

		IB gubatantially in accord with the one taken by Dr.
Forman	PERSON	in his recent study of `` The Political Ac - tivities of Philip Freneau . ''

		Both writers , however , agpree in attributing the sincerest motives to the edi - tor of '' The Gazette . ''

		On the whole , the edition is altogether worthy of the real '' Father of American Poetry , '' who at last seems to be coming to his own .

		In Mr.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	's latest contribution to the literature of art , there is a singularly happy blend of strong personal sentiment and sound doctrine .

		The writer goes into '' The Meaning of Pictures '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- with enthusiasm and yet with judgment , and so has given us a book that makes very good reading whether we wish to go to school or merely to be interested .

		The book contains six lectures delivered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art .

		The subject is considered from the view-point of a mind open to the reasonable claims of those for whom pictures are made , while not closed to the consider - ations that enter into the making of them , and is presented in a way that is singularly entertaining .

		We have a general statement of what painted pict - ures -- from
Botticelli	LOCATION	to
Whistler	LOCATION	, from
Raphael	PERSON	to
Degas	LOCATION	, from saints and madonnas to ballet girls -- mean to those at large for whom they are painted .

		The writer 's philosophy of this art -- a very sane one , as would naturally follow from the state of mind indicated -- is dressed out in such diction , and pointed with such apt illustrations and comparisons , that the reader easily absorbs it , and gets ideas about art that will modify his views and help him to subordinate personal preferences to principles in his judgment of it .

		It may be ques - tioned if any other book of its scope hat -RRB- ever shown '' the meaning of pictures '' in a way that will make it so clear to the average English reader .

		The text is illustrated with thirty excellent reproductions of paintings selected from the period it covers , a period that embraces all that greatly signifies in this art .

		A '' gmiu , ca : , ar ' , I ' ^ eems Strange that the English firit biography language should have gone without ♦ n Engiuh .

		^ biography of
Augustus Caesar	PERSON	un - til the present year , -- but in their search for more '' Heroes of the Nations '' to write about , the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	have hit upon him at last , and have sup - plied the deficiency so far as the limitations of the series would allow .

		Like others of the series , it is a book for the mature reader rather than the boy , and it seems a pity that the publishers should have selected a general title with so hopelessly juvenile a sound .

		Mr.
J. B. Firth	PERSON	, the author of this vol - ume , sets forth the facts of the career of Augustus fairly , but many will not follow him in his readi - ness to excuse all the means by which the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	was established .

		The tendency to make success itself the moral test of the means by which it was secured is carried rather too far in these days .

		Readers of
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	will remember how often Tiberius plead the example of Augustus in support of his own policy .

		The present volume will certainly deepen the impression of a fundamental resem - blance between the two emperors , not only in their policy but in many personal features as well .

		Mr.
Firth	PERSON	supports the '' Dyarchy '' theory of the nature of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	in its earlier history , but he brings forward no case in which the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	exer - cised its alleged powers contrary to the will of the Emperor at the time .

		A dyarchy in which one member acts only by the gracious concession of the other , is but a virtual monarchy after all .

		It need only be added that in its mechanical execation the volume is a worthy representative of the well-known series to which it belongs .

		Stiort Hvet 0 / great ariittt .

		Two recent additions to the `` Pop - ular Library of Art '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- are devoted to two such diverse person - alities as DUrer and Millet .

		In both cases , the in - terest in the individual is almost coordinate with that in the artist .

		The stories of their lives , though relatively simple , are full of interest , and reflect the different situation of the artist in the social life of the period .

		The DUrer biography is written by Miss
Lina Eckenstein	PERSON	, and , though not acknowledged as a translation , certainly reads as such .

		It is a well - told tale , in which the personal side appears out of proportion to the account of the artist 's achieve - ments ; but it gives in brief compass , and with well - chosen illustrations , a suggestive account of the deeds of a great man .

		The book on Millet is a translation from the French of M. Remain
Rolland	PERSON	; but the translation is remarkably smooth .

		The simple incidents in the life of this artist are well put together to make an interesting and impressive story of final triumph over adverse personal cir - cumstances .

		Millet remains the best type of the peasant artist , and throughout his life he reflected both in bis work and personality the intimate con - tact with soil and nature , as well as the abhorrence of the artificialities of city life , all of which gives individuality to his work and makes it a central point in the history of modern French art .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We have received from
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
MifBin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Parts I. and II .

		of a new work on '' Trees and Shrubs , '' by Professor
Charles Sprague Sargent	PERSON	.

		This work is supplementary to the author 's monumental ''
Silva	PERSON	of
North America	LOCATION	, '' and will , when completed , add two uew quarto volumes to the twelve of the main work .

		It seems that during the progress of Professor
Sargent	PERSON	's undertaking , nearly a hundred aud fifty new arboreal species have received botanical recognition , and it is to the description of these hitherto unrecog - nized forms that the supplementary volumes will be devoted .

		The sections now issued describe , with plates , fifty ligneous species , of which no less than fifteen be - long to the single genus Crataegus , of which the author has been making an exhaustive study during recent years .

		When these new volumes are completed they will contain an index to the entire work .

		New editions of Lever and Bulwer are started , re - spectively , with `` Harry Lorrequer '' and `` Night and Morning . ''

		They are charming pocket volumes , bound in limp leather , and published by Mr.
George Newnes	PERSON	, from whom the editions are imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	for the American market .

		Mr.
Warren K. Moorehead	PERSON	has in preparation an exhaustive archaeological encyclopaedia devoted to the implements , ornaments , etc. , of the pre - historic tribes of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The work will be issued in two volnmes , fully illustrated , by the
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, during the winter of
1905	DATE	.

		Mr.
Howard WilfordBell	PERSON	, a
London	LOCATION	publisher , sends us a volume of '' Pens ^ es from the Journal Intime of Henri-Fr ^ d ^ ric
Amiel	PERSON	, '' arranged by Mr.
D. K. Petano	PERSON	.

		M. Bourget 's '' Etude '' prefaces the volume , whose contents are given in the English language , althoogh this would hardly be inferred from the title .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue at once the first volnme in a limited edition de luxe of the complete works of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, uniform with their previous special editions of Lamb ,
Pater	PERSON	,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		The fifteenth and final volume of the set will contain a complete bibliography of
Arnold	LOCATION	's writings , compiled by Mr.
Thomas Burnett	PERSON	Smart .

		The latest preprints from the
University of Chisago	ORGANIZATION	decennial publications include the following mono - graphs : '' Greek Papyri from the

James Westfall Thomp	PERSON	- son ; `` Two Old Spanish Versions of the Disticha Catonis , '' by Professor
Karl Pietsch	PERSON	; and `` The Rela - tions of Psychology to Philosophy , '' by Professor
James Rowland Angell	PERSON	.

		We have from
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's a translation , by Mr. Ar - thur
Edward Waite	PERSON	, of Senancour 's ''
Obermann	PERSON	, '' a work less read to-day than talked about , yet which certainly deserved translation long before this .

		A translation by
Miss Frothingham	PERSON	has preceded the present one , but is published at a high price in a limited edition , so that we still have room for Mr.
Waite	PERSON	's version .

		An elabor - ate introduction , both critical and biographical , adds materially to the valne of the present work . ''

		The Complete Poetical Works of Alexander Pope , '' edited by Mr.
H. W. Boynton	PERSON	, has been added to the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' poets published by
Messrs. Houghton , Miffiin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	's introduction is compact and discriminating , and he has also provided a helpful and not over-swollen body of notes .

		The poems are printed in a nearly chronological order , and the text , a result of careful collation , is based upon the standard Croker-Elwin-Courthope edition .

		Pope 's own notes have for the most part been retained , except that all of his notes to Homer have been omitted .

		Only Pope 's own part of the '' Odyssey '' -- the first half -- is here included .

		We thus have a serviceable Pope in a single volume , which is , as far as we know , the first of its I kind .

		I Mr.
Albert Sonnichsen	PERSON	, who will be recalled as having set down his experiences in book form after a captivity of nearly a year among the Filipinos , now writes '' Deep Sea V ^ agabonds '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an - nouncing himself as '' able seaman '' on the title-page and proving his right to the name on every page sae - ceeding .

		The book makes its appeal as a transcript from real life , not g ^ reatly idealized , and saved from much of the brutalizing effect of life on the high seas in merchant vessels by a sunny disposition and the fact that the author had the wit to avoid American mer - chantmen and their bnllying bncko mates .

		Real skill is shown in setting down these memoirs , and Mr. Son - nichsen ' g unwillingness to indulge in the coarser vices of his fellows gives a reason for his clear insight into the sailor 's inner life .

		As might be expected , he has been everywhere and seen everything , at least on the coasts of the world .

		But he is characteristically less concerned with life ashore than with life afloat .

		Professor
Arber	PERSON	's '' English Gamer '' was published in eight volumes during the period between
1877	DATE	and
1890	DATE	, and the work has been ever since a treasare - honse for the student of early English history and literature .

		A reissue of the work , extended to twelve volumes , is now being made under the editorship of Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	, the contents being classified for the first time , and pieced out by the addition of fresh matter .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers of this new edition , of which four volnmes have already reached us .

		Two of the four are devoted to '' Voyages and Travels , '' and have an introduction by Mr.
C. Raymond Beazley	PERSON	; the other two are `` Social England Illustrated , '' with an introduction by Mr.
I Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and '' Critical Essays and Literary Frag - \ ments , '' with an introduction by Mr.
J. Chnrton Collins	PERSON	.

		I The new issue thus becomes a series of separate works , each with its own introduction and index , and is conse - quently far more useful than was Professor
Arber	PERSON	's original publication .

		From the `` New York Times . ''

		* ' Its paf ^ es not only contain an account of the little happenings of a little world in which all social barriers , save those of naval discipline , had been dispensed with , but also the conversation of members of the party , the suggestions , comments , and criticisms of various projects which might have meant so much had they been carried out .

		Written on the spot , this journal readily conveys to the reader the emotions ex - perienced by the party on the return of the successful sledging expedi - tions .

		Like the assembly on the '
Stella Polare	PERSON	* the Buke ^ s readers are taken into his confidence , and become , perhaps , even better acquainted with him than were the members of his crew .

		The book is sure to pos - sess intense human interest as a document by an enthusiastic explorer , who , incidentally , is a member of the royal house of Savoy . ''

		It presents a wonderfully interesting story in an easy , picturesque style .
