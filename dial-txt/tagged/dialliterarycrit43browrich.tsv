		NOTES 21 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 22 -- t6e fallac y of specialism .

		We are often reminded of the fact that this is the age of the specialist , and that success in any field of endeavor , whether material or intellectual , is not likely to be attained save as the result of thorough equipment in some specialized department of activity .

		The more restricted the region chosen for research and its practical applications , the more nearly com - plete is the monopoly of knowledge and skill , and the more certainly can the specialist make his own terms with the world that has need of his services .

		The logic of this situation is too obvious to need enforcement , and countless iUustrations of the advantage in question will occur to every reader .

		Yet , sound as this reasoning may be fundamentaUy , it is fre - quently made a starting-point for fallacious inferences that work no little confusion to the judgment , and that sometimes become fairly mischievous in their effect .

		In a general way , it may be said that this effect is analogous to the physical phenomentm of irradiation , which unconsciously persuades us that an illuminated area is considerably larger than actual measure - ment would indicate .

		Before discussing this point , however , we wish to make it perfectly clear that we can have no quarrel with the most narrowly special - ized knowledge as such , even with knowledge that is seemingly of little or no practical use .

		Our sympathies have always been on the side of the legendary humanist who thanks because the English universities taught nothing that was useful -LRB- as men vulgarly employ that term '' -RRB- , and we long since took to heart the teaching that the attainment of truth is a worthy end in itself , irrespective of its possible bearings upon conduct or worldly success .

		The possessor of exact knowledge of any kind , the one who knows whereof he speaks , is the truest benefactor of man , and the credulous or vagrant instincts implanted in most human beings can not be called too sternly to accoxmt , or too strictly subjected to the discipline of science .

		The mis - chief done to intellectual integrity by a wanton disregard of fact , by slovenly habits of reasoning , imd by the intrusion of prejudice into judgment , is in any case so enormous that we dare not speak slightingly of those whose influence serves : the dial -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, as a corrective of the evil , although they may sometimes seem to us shrivelled up by pedantiy , and possessed of weazened apologies for souls .

		Having made this disclaimer , we will revert to our metaphor of irradiation .

		When a man has attained gi-eat eminence in some department of knowledge , even a narrow one , it is difficidt to disabuse ourselves of the notion that his ideas upon any subject must be illuminating .

		A famous physicist declares his belief in '' spirit - ualism , '' and the fact that he is a famous physicist makes many people think that the case of the spook is strengthened by his confession .

		A distinguished naturalist dabbles in socialism or astronomy , and his fantastic imaginings are taken seriously just becaiLse he is a distinguished naturalist .

		A great teacher of ethics proclaims his conviction that the world 's estimate of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is absurdly exaggerated , and the opinion is thought to have a certain weight merely for the reason that it has been pro- nounced by a profound moralist .

		In all such cases , we fall victims to the fallacious inference that authority upon one subject dignifies pro- noimcements upon any other , bestowing upon them a greater significance than could be given them by the average man .

		This trait of popular psychology is well luiderstood by editors of newspapers and magazines , by spokesmen of every sort of propaganda , and by all the shrewd host of those who have wares to advertise .

		Few people realize the extent to which the intel - lectual life , even of really great men , is con - ducted by a system of water-tight compartments , whereby it becomes quite possible for supersti - tion and clear-visioned science to have joint occupancy of the same bi-ain-tenement .

		And with men whose distinction rests upon a nar - rower basis , it is quite possible for one part of the intellectual mechanism to be in perfect working order , while the other parts exhibit loose screws and faulty adjustment .

		What we have called the fallacy of specialism is still more likely to escape detection when the case under observation , instead of concerning widely separated departments of knowledge , concerns only the different divisions of what , to the general view , seems to be one and the same area .

		A physician , for example , may have exceptional skUl in diagnosis , and yet his knowl - edge of the other subjects required by his pro- fession may be so defective as to make him an uncertain practitioner .

		A lawj ` er may be pro- foundly versed in the principles of the civil law , and yet find himself all at sea in dealing with common-law cases .

		The most striking illustrar tion of this one-sided equipment that comes to our mind is offered by the .

		specialists who con - duct the instruction in English -LRB- to say nothing of other languages and literatures -RRB- in our uni - versities .

		In nine cases out of ten the instructor 's credentials for the performance of his function are supplied by some fragment of technical linguistic investigation or the critical examina ^ tion of some obscure author or exceptionally barren period of the literature .

		But the actual task which he has in hand is to acquaint yoimg people with the principles of literary art , to help them interpret the master-minds of the race , and to Inspire them with an enthusiasm for stately prose and noble poetry .

		Never was there a more evident malatljustment of means to ends ; never was there a more glaring illus - tration of the undistributed middle than is found in the argiunent which would prove these men fitted to these f mictions .

		To be a specialist in Gower or in the
Northumbrian	ORGANIZATION	dialect of Old English -- so runs the argument -- Is a warrant of competency to expound the divine humanity of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the political wisdom of
Burke	PERSON	, and the flawless art of Tennyson !

		We are tempted to add to this discussion a few words upon what may not unfairly be styled the arrogance of specialism .

		The man who is conscious of knowing more than other scholars about some special subject is pretty apt to mag - nify his own importance , and to affect -LRB- perhaps really to feel -RRB- only scorn for those men who believe that breadth of view and philosophical grasp are more to be desired than any of the ends of specialism .

		He regards himself and his feUow-specIallsts as the only properly accredited members of the guild of scholarship , and lias at his command an array of contemptuous epithets for those who pretend to scholarly dis - tinction upon any other basis .

		Whoever woiUd rashly enter the sacred bounds without a doc - toral dissertation for a passport must be sent about his business , must be forced to haunt for - ever the limbo of amateurs .

		It was only the other day that we were reading in a specialist journal the review of a recent work of literary biography and interpretation .

		The work is an admirable one in every respect , and this the reviewer was honest enough to allow .

		But he could not refrain from expressing his plain - tive regret that it was not written by a Fachmann , even although the work might have been no better done .

		More effective than any labored exposition of the specialist 's attitude toward the rest of mankind is the naive revela - tion afforded by this incident .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL THE WEATHER IN LITERATURE .

		Calveriey thought that if such braTC rhymes of the olden time as '' weather '' and '' together '' were bwidled up and carted away , there woold be fewer volumes of verse .

		If the weather it '' elf were to be eliminated from literatore , both prose and verse would show lacunje almost as groit as the space between the stars is to the stars themselves .

		The weather is the chief subject of human interest and intercourse .

		We b ^ in every conversation with pro- pitiatory or damnatory remarks about it We study its signs and signal its arrival or departure as though it were a royal guest .

		And rightly : for on the weather depends our harvests , our healths , our intellects , and our complexions .

		Whether we are Caucasian or Negro depends upon the intensity of our suns .

		Whether we are energetic or languid depends upon the quality of our atmoephere .

		We are all servUe to the skyey influences .

		A railroad train hurtles straight to the west and the sinking sun , like an arrow towards a shield - In a meadow at one side , a herd of horses breaks into frightened flight .

		A bird darts upward , sing - ing as though it would burst its breast .

		A young girL in whose eyes sleep the visions and images of the future , looks out from a cottage porch .

		All these varj-ing forms of force draw tJieir power from yonder reddened orb about to be obscured .

		Nothing exists , that we can apprehend , but the human spirit and the weather .

		All the phenomena of nature are only more advanced and stationary stages of weather .

		Spring belts the world with a band of blossoms which resembles the delicate or daring hues of dawn .

		The green mantle of Summer reechoes the blue of cloudless skies ; and
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	, with its purples and yellows and reds , mocks the sunset fires .

		The rivers and lakes and oceans are only a thicker kind of mist .

		The mountains them - selves are but secular clouds .

		If we could imagine a slow-lived being to whom centuries were but as our moments , we could think of him watching the eternal hills heaving and changing and crumbling away , just as we watch the storm-doods of our atmosphere .

		Every age is conceited about some one thing above the rest -- usually with little eanse .

		The age of
Louis	LOCATION	Xr \ ' .

		thought it had perfected polite civ - ilization .

		The age of the French Revolution thought it had discovered Liberty .

		Equality , and Fraternity .

		Our age has been prouder , perhaps , of patronizing Nature than of anything else .

		Yet the Greeks studied natural effects with keener eyes than ours .

		The Romans were as much in love with country life as we are .

		Their villas were scattered all around the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and among Alpine and
Apennine	LOCATION	hills .

		And under the early Christian regune , every dell and desert place had its hermit Perhaps
Ruskin	PERSON	is right in thinking that neither of these races cared much for the higher mountain solitudes or the gloom of deep woods .

		But our Aryan ancestors or relatives who poured across the Himalayas were familiar with heights to which the mountains of
Europe	LOCATION	were mole-hills .

		They knew intimately forests to which our stateliest woods are toad-holes compared to temples .

		Their earliest gods were purely incarnations of physical phenomena .

		--
India	LOCATION	of the sky , Sniya of the sun ,
Agni	PERSON	of fire itself : the Shining Ones these .

		It was not until later that thb triad became metaphysicized into
Vishnu	LOCATION	.

		Brahma , and
Siva	PERSON	.

		The Mamts were the storm-gods .

		The Apsaras and
Gandharvas	PERSON	were the clouds turned into beautiful and friendly maidens and attendant youths .

		And from the woods arose dreadful Rakshasas , demons who contended not unequally with the golden gods .

		The difference between the ancients ' way of view - ing Nature and our own is simply that they saw physical phenomena alive , animated with will and thought and pa ^ on ; whereas we see them a mere catalogue of dead things .

		We are content to assume that intellect belongs to ntan alone , just as if we were absolutely certain that an oak-tree has no intelligence , or that the ocean does not know what it is about when it rises in rage and dashes our vessels down to shipwreck .

		For the purposes of literature , at any rate , the old beliefs were better than ours .

		Where we only see a round ball blazing in the sky and cooking mankind with its fiery rays , they saw the angry Apollo striding from his Olympian halls with the bow in his hand and the arrows rat - tling on his shoulders .

		Where we only hear the thunder crashing Uirou ^ the sky , they saw the terrible King of Gods lifting his majestic bead and hurling the bolts from his right hand .

		Where we only see the level floor of the ocean , they saw sleek Panope and all her sisters playing upon it We think we have got at the causes of things .

		-- but really we do not know why different seeds produce each after its own kind , or why carbon and hydrogen combine in various proportions to form organic sub - stances .

		Why should not our elements or atoms or deetnins be the sentient forbears of many conscious races which unite , marry , oppose , or strive with each other , and in certain of their exhibitions arise to a divinity beyond the reach of man ?

		But of course it is nonsense to snppose that modem literature has done away with the super - ualunL Gods and goddesses sprung from and guid - ing the processes of nature , and interfering in the affairs of men , have to some extent been driven off .

		But their place has been taken bj angels , devils , witches , fairies , ghosts , and a thousand other forms of spiritual life .

		More important stiU .

		modem writers have given a soul to inanimate things ; they have brought nature into sympathy with man .

		they have harmonized their backgrounds with the action of the central figures , they have invented tone in literature or at least have practised it to a far greater extent than the ancients .

		It is recorded of the late
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, that she objected to what she called '' dark '' plays -- meaning pieces where the backgrounds were sombre and the lighting obscure .

		It is creditable to her critical in - THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, stinct that she divined the fact of there being such a totality of effect .

		The majority of writers have never made a guess at it .

		Where tone is apparent at all in literature , it may be divided mto dark or bright effects , or a mingling and contrast of the two . ''

		Macbeth '' is probably the most magnificent sombre tone-piece in literature .

		There are high lights in it , but they are awe-inspiring , unearthly , hellish .

		From the windy , cloudy sunset on the heath -LRB- it is sunset , for
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	says , '' So fair and foul a day I have not seen '' -RRB- to the storm and lightning that presage and accompany the murder , to the fires and boiling cauldrons of the Witches ' cave , to the ghost - like Lady Macbeth with her solitary candle , all the lights only accentuate the gloom and horror , the outward and inward tumult of the play .

		Scott 's '' Bride of Lammermoor '' is keyed to a twilight melancholy rather than a stormy might .

		There is an autumnal haze about it through which the gaunt trees of the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's lost estate , his dilapidated house , and even its gi'im steward of starvation ,
Caleb Balderstone	PERSON	, show half spectral and unreal .

		It is only in the dreadfully hinted story of the bridal night , and the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's death in the ravening sands , that the thing leaps into tragedy .

		Dickens 's ''
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	'' has two centres of light -- the
Maypole Inn	ORGANIZATION	and the
Varden	PERSON	household .

		Around these whirl and surge the shadows of the story -- the mysteries of the murder ,
Barnaby	PERSON	and his raven , that uncanny modern
Caliban	LOCATION	,
Hugh	PERSON	, the Grordon riots , and all the rest of the gloomy turmoil .

		Grood as these things are , and whether
Dickens	PERSON	intended it or not , they only serve to isolate and bring out the lighted parts of the picture , which by contrast acquire an inexpressible charm .

		It is doubt - ful if
Dickens	PERSON	ever painted anything with more mel - low depth of tone than the
Maypole Inn	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its wide hospitable spread of wings without , its cosy snugness within , its host and his crowd of village cronies , give the very sentiment and soul of inn-life once for all .

		And the companion picture , the household of the joUy locksmith , is aU sparkle and vivacity , cvdmi - nating in the rosy cheeks and many-colored garb of Dolly herself .

		Coming upon either of these scenes out of the darkness that surrounds them is like hap - pening upon a camp-fire in a forest at night .

		The great black tree-boles encircle it , the foliage keeps even the starlight away , but there on the shadow - sifted sward is a little heart of warmth and comfort .

		There is probably no piece of pure sunlight in literatm-e so perfect as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' Twelfth Night . ''

		It is hardly real sunlight , hardly even the sunlight of Greek poetry ; it is a half enchanted sunlight that turns even the ugly or the common to favor and prettiness .

		In the '' Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' there is more contrast ; dark passions and stormy scenes intervene , making the play more picturesque and less serenely beautiful : but in the end aU the jarring elements are hushed into perfect peace and rest .

		This adjustment of environment and lighting to human action -- the interpenetration of nature and man -- which I have called tone , is present in Greek literature mainly by fits and starts .

		I can - not recall any single piece , except perhaps the Bacchanals of
Euripides	LOCATION	, where it is a predominant technical quality .

		In the night-raid of Diomed , in the
Iliad	LOCATION	, in the
Nausikaa	LOCATION	scenes of the Odyssey , there is the perfection of tone ; but these passages are far from giving the keynotes of either poem .

		And similarly with the Dido episode in the .

		^ neid , and the hero 's descent into the underworld .

		They are only two of the many quite discordant elements out of which
Virgil	PERSON	's poem is made .

		If we con - sider
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's great work to be three separate poems , we shall find each of them marvellously toned to one predetermined effect .

		The black air of hell , lit by the red towers of Dis , lit by the fiery pyres of the sentenced sinners , lit by the falling flakes of fire , lit by those ineffable figures of God 's mes - sengers drawn in hues of dawn against the dark background , -- all this , in the first poem , is har - mony or intensifying contrast of hue .

		Nor is the '' Purgatorio '' inferior in total effect with its more eartlily and human , yet penitential , lights and shadows .

		And the '' Paradiso '' is one blaze of light , with hardly enough shadow to define the figures and objects .

		The human figure and its surroundings -- these are the factors of literature .

		God must always be represented as supernatural nature or superhuman man .

		Sometimes , as in
Wordworth	LOCATION	, the natural phe - nomena crowd man out of the canvas -- mountains are the heroes , cataracts the heroines of the work ; some - times , as in most social comedy , nature is an almost invisible frame to hold together the crowd of human actors ; sometimes , as in the very central art of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the earthy platform and its aerial dis - tances are a floor and backgi-ound which change and answer to the passions of the predominant soul of man ; sometimes , as in Greek literature , this back - ground is itself alive , and , taking a hundred human shapes , thrusts itself into the action .

		To carry the subject a little further , what are the probable effects on a national literature of thirty degrees of latitude ?

		I mean , how wUl the various climates of our country , ranging from a half-arctic desolation to tropic bloom and splendor , work them - selves out in our literary production ?

		Most of the gi'eat literatures of the world have arisen in countries of circumscribed area and undiversified climate .

		However great may have been their voyagings of imagination , however vast the piratical spoils they may have brought back , the stamp of one home is impressed upon each .

		Thus , Hindu literature sprang from the gi'eat jungle at the foot of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		The depths of those forests , the height of those hills , were impressed upon it .

		Greek poetry was the child of the carved hills of
Attica	LOCATION	, of the sunny Ionian isles .

		No matter what excursions it made into the savage or the unknown , it never lost its clear out - lines and serene air .

		The Scandinavian and Celtic literatures were born under the great forests , under the great mists , under the dark mountains of the
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL north : and mystical glamor , gigantic formlessness , emotional thrill pervade them .

		In
America	LOCATION	, the world is all before ns where to choose .

		Shall we be dear and sunny , passionate and trivial , with the South ?

		Shall we he dark and cold , powerful and profound , with the North . '

		Or something between the two , with our middle belt of States ?

		`` We have tried to be everything .

		Each localitj - has reproduced itself in literature , but with a lack of power and authority which results from there being no central type of fatherland and home .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		In pr .

		\ ise of fictios axd fictios-readehs the prevailing tone of Mr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	's ad - dress at the late convention of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Asheville	LOCATION	,
X. C	ORGANIZATION	.

		The speaker , who is one of the librarians of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, has had ample opportunity to study his subject , and his utterances were among the least hackneyed that were beard in the whole course of the convention .

		Mr.
Bostwick	PERSON	is intelligently optimistic , and refuses to be alarmed by the eighty-four per cent of fiction that his library circulated last year .

		The demand for narrative literature he beUeves to be indicative of a healthy ap - petite ; for is not narrative the principal part of history , biography , and travel -- and , he might have added , of epic poetry ?

		He holds that not all book-drunkards are novel-readers ; but that science and philosophy have their topers , and even mathematics may debauch the brain .

		He denies that a
Ubrary	ORGANIZATION	's chief aim should be to circulate non-fiction .

		^ Vhile we may regret to see a young lady reading
Laura Jean Libbey	PERSON	rather than
Henry James	PERSON	, we can yet comfort ourselves with the reflection that probably her mother read less estimable books than
Miss Libbey	LOCATION	's -- or , as he might again have added , no books at all , but only the newspapers .

		There is no cause for despair , we are assured .

		Romance has its place as dessert in the feast of reason , and it has been scientifically proved that even sugar is a food .

		Mr.
Bostwick	PERSON	, we are glad to note in conclusion , is the newly-elected president of the
A. L. A. •	PERSON	• • The protest agatsst `` Shakespeare , '' from the pen of Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	, eUcits from our
Cambridge Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	scholar -LRB- for both Cambridges have their distinguished editors of the
Stratford	LOCATION	playwright -RRB- a vigorous counter-protest .

		Mr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	says in a published letter : '' Of course the dispute will con - tinue till the crack of doom , but I believe '
Shakespeare	PERSON	' wUl hold its own as the Uterary form of the name ... Of the five indisputable autographs that survive , one b clearly ` Shakspere ' ; another is either that or '
Shakspeare	PERSON	' ; a third -LRB- on his will -RRB- is so faded that it can not be certainly deciphered , but a fac-simile of
1776	DATE	indicates that it was ` Shakspere ' ; the fourth and fifth -LRB- also on the will -RRB- have been read both as ' Shakspere ' and ' Shakspeare , ' but
Sidney Lee	PERSON	says that close examination proves that the fifth is ' Shake - speare . '

		The dedications to ' Venus and Ad < mis ' and ' Lucrece , ' the only works of the poet that were cer - tainly seen through the press by himself , are both agned ■
William Shakespeare	PERSON	. '

		This is also the spell - ing on the title-pages of the forty or more editions of single plays printed during his lifetime -LRB- with only two exceptions -RRB- , and of the four foho editions of the col - lected plays published after his death .

		It is the form almost unanimously adopted in the published references to him in the seventeenth century .

		It appears in many , if not most , of the old legal documents relating to him ; as , for instance , in the license granted to him and his fellow-players by
King James	PERSON	in
1603	DATE	.

		It is also the spelling accepted by the great majority of the editors , commentators and critics of the last century . '' ''

		Shake - speare '' then let it be , even if ' • Shakspere '' does save ink , as
Sarah Duchess	PERSON	of
Marlborough	LOCATION	said in explain - ing why she left her -LRB- 's uncrossed and her fs undotted .

		• • • A TBSTAXKSTARY cuRioeiTY has been going the rounds of the press , and most readers are now familiar with it .

		Perhaps fewer are aware that this alleged will of one
Charles Lounsbury	PERSON	-- who is represented as hav - ing been an occupant of an asylum for the insane at
Dunning	ORGANIZATION	, HI. , and whose generous bequest of all out - doors to the children made such charming reading -- was a harmless hoax perpetrated in an idle moment by a
Chicago	LOCATION	lawyer , Mr.
Williston Fish	PERSON	, and printed in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' nine years ago .

		Besides being widelv quoted , this bright httle piece was made the sub - ject of an editorial recently by the
New York	LOCATION	'' Inde - pendent , '' and at a late dinner of the alumni association of the
Xew York Law University	ORGANIZATION	, Judge
Walter Lloyd Smith	PERSON	, of
Elmira	LOCATION	, read aloud this remarkable will , com - menting admiringly on its several clauses .

		Sundry newspapers have reprinted it , and the superintendent of the
Dunning Asylum	ORGANIZATION	has been overwhelmed with inquiries concerning his supposed patient .

		Mr.
Fish	PERSON	, who is a graduate of West Point , is reported as saying of himself and his writings : '' My army life gave me an opportunity to write .

		I used to write for ' Puck ' and ' life , ' and ' A Last Will ' was just one of those little fancies that sometimes occur to you .

		It was published , paid for , and , as I believed , forgotten . ''

		Curiously enough , Mr.
Fish	PERSON	had a great-grandfather named
Charles Lounsbury	PERSON	; and perhaps to this ancestor he owes some part of that happy endowment that enables him , in his leisure half - hours , to throw off these '' little fancies . ''

		... A JEWEL IX A DCST-HEAP , tumed up by the prod of some humble delver for unconsidered trifles , could hardlv have brought greater surprise and joy to the finder than did the recent chance discovery , by a
London	LOCATION	dealer in second-hand books , of a perfect copy of
Gabriel Thomas	PERSON	's '' Account of the
Province and Country of Pennsvlvania	ORGANIZATION	and of West-New-Jersey in
America	LOCATION	, '' with dedication to '' Friend
William Penn	PERSON	, '' published in
London	LOCATION	two hundred and nine years ago .

		This ancient volume , valuable as the earUest historically important work on
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and as having a rare old map of the colonies , was one of several score old books purchased in a lump for a few shillings .

		But not for some time after examining his treasure did the lucky finder recognize its full worth . ''

		He was even so reckless as to offer it for sale at a beggarly # 5 .

		For - tunatelv for him no connoisseur in Americana chanced that way before he had come to his senses ; and he now hopes to get # 160 for it , the price for which a copy was sold at
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's not long ago .

		In this connection it may be interesting to note the reported discovery some months since , at a bookstall in the Mile - # nd Road -- a shabby and unpromising neighborhood -- of THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, a volume of Molifere which the unalert proprietor gladly parted with for twopence halfpenny , and which was later sold for
# 31	DATE	.

		Who shall say that the era has passed for realizing great and sudden fortunes , or that the Old World does not vie with the New in money-making opportunities ?

		... Pragmatism and metaphysics appear to be related to each other somewhat as are works and faith .

		The high priest of pragmatism , the new philosophy , is -LRB- in this country -RRB- the distinguished psychologist .

		Dr.
William James	PERSON	, who is said to have resigned his
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professorship in order to devote himself wholly to the propagation of the new gospel .

		As fellow - workers in the cause he has Dr.
Paul Cams	PERSON	, able editor of '' The Monist '' and `` The Open Court , '' and Professor
Dewey	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, formerly of
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, as well as other thinkers and scholars here and abroad . ''

		Pragmatism , '' explains a pragmatist , '' values ideas by their consequences .

		Those that have no consequences it casts out of consideration . ''

		Mr.
James	PERSON	amplifies this as follows : '' The only meaning of truth is the possibility of verification by experience , '' and '' ` Tnie ' is the term applied to whatever it is practically profitable to believe . ''

		This doctrine must bring relief to many a weary and bewildered reader of mutually contra - dictory philosophy books , who , after heavily plodding through them all , has merely the consciousness of being , like
Faust	PERSON	at the end of his studies , '' so Hug als wie zuvor . ''

		... An encourager of
summer	DATE	reading is the liberal librarian , or library trustee , whose love of red-tape is overborne by a desire to increase the library 's useful - ness , and to turn wliat is often called `` the silly season '' into a season of edification .

		The ciurent montlily bul - letin of the
Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Pittsburg	LOCATION	, prints some rules that will delight vacation readers .

		Regular card - holders , leaving town for the
summer	DATE	, may take with them ten books , four of which may be novels , and the whole ten may be kept until the first of
October	DATE	.

		Books not yet a year old , m library ownership , are excepted , as are also such other works as it may seem miwise to remove from general circidation for so long a time .

		This arrangement is creditable to all concerned , and a like liberality is coming more and more to be exercised by the public libraries in our other cities .

		• • • The author of '' Axick-for-siiort , '' Mr.
William Frend De Morgan	PERSON	, who is also well-known as the author of ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	, '' proves to be the son of no less a celebrity than
Augustus De Morgan	PERSON	, the mathematician .

		Educated at
University College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, he began to study art in
1858	DATE	, became a student in the
Royal Academy	LOCATION
a year later	DATE	, practised arts and crafts till early in the present century , when he wrote the begin - nmg of ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	, '' to see whether he had a turn for fiction .

		He decided in the negative , but his wife found the manuscript and persuaded him to finish it .

		The story is not autobiographical , as many have sup - posed ; and its successor is equally a work of the imagi - nation .

		De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	fiction now promises to outrival De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	pottery -- the ware produced at the works erected by Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	in the early seventies .

		• • • Keen discernment of literary genius has been evinced by American readers in the ease of more than one English author who later achieved recognition from his own countrymen .

		Under
Emerson	PERSON	's lead we did much to hasten
Carlyle	PERSON	's lagging fame ; and this service to one of the greatest , if not the very greatest , of
Vic	PERSON	- torian writers might have gone down in history as unequaled in its kind had it not lately been discovered that a far more famous name in English literature -- the most famous , in fact , both in English letters and in the literature of all the world -- owes its lustre , not partly , but solely , to intelligent citizens of our own country .

		A
London	LOCATION	newspaper man , who had been staying at
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	, is reported to have asked his landlady one day : `` Who is this Shakespeare I hear so much about down here ?

		Was he a veiy great man ? ''

		To this jocular question the landlady made serious reply : '' Lor ' , sir , ' e wor n't thought nothing on a few years ago .

		It 's the Americans as ` as made ` im wh ^ t ` eis . ''

		... A CRUSADE against THE CIGARETTE IN FICTION , and also against all indulgence in alcoholic liquors , is said to have been started by the
Frances E. Willard	PERSON	branch of the
Woman 's Christian Temperance Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		And more than this : not content with tabooing all novels in which hero or heroine smokes cigarettes -LCB- why not cigars also , and pipes ? -RRB-

		or drinks intoxicants , these zealous ladies have decided to include in their con - demnation every hero and heroine whose language savors of profanity .

		`` It is considered quite smart , '' a leading member of this band of reformers is quoted as saying , '' for the hero to rip out an oath ; but to me an oath is as bad as a murder . ''

		Shades of
Dumas	PERSON	and Fielding , what a judgment !

		Will nothing induce these kind ladies to use a little discrimination -- to make the punishment more accuratelj ' fit the crime ?

		• • V Plagiarism the sincerest flattery might serve as an appropriate device for the new
London	LOCATION	publishing house of ''
Collier & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' the firm name adopted by Mr.
Ralph Hall Caine	PERSON	, son of the Manx novelist .

		The name
Collier	PERSON	appealed to the young publisher because to him it seemed to stand for success in American publishing .

		He opens for business in Tudor Street , and begins with three-shilling novels , one of them by his father , who just at present is displaying much zeal for the shortening of works of fiction -- after having , with industrious pen , done his best to induce satiety in the novel-reading world and thus to create a reaction in favor of stories less long-drawn-out than , for example , '' The Christian '' and '' The Eternal City . ''

		• • • The English Ambassador 's suggestion to col - lege women , in his recent commencement address at
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	, was a good one .

		He urged the members of the graduating class to cultivate a thorough know - ledge of and a fine taste in literatiu'e -- a field that the average male citizen has no time to enter .

		The habit of reading what is not ephemeral was strongly recom - mended .

		Even without this excellent advice to guide her course , woman has already , in these latter days , shown herself a formidable rival to man in the field of polite letters ; and she is likely to push him still harder in the years to come .

		• • ■ A varying price for novels is sensibly enough ad - vocated by '' The Publishers ' Weekly , '' which lu-ges that the amount paid for a work of fiction shoidd bear some relation to its size and presumable excellence -- long novels commanding higher prices than short , and the products of famous pens selling at a larger figure than the firstlings of untried beginners .

		But no commercial rating of quality would prove satisfactory to all con - cerned , and probably the most that could be effected
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL would be an adjustment of price to cost of manufacture -- tliat is , in general , to the number of words in the book .

		Already Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	has taken a step in this direction by fixing the price of Mr.
WUIiam De Morgan	PERSON	's novel '' Alice-for-short '' -- which in one sense might better be named '' Alice-for-loug , '' since it extends to 575 pages -- at SI .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE `` SOUTHERN VIEW '' EN LITERATDRE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
The Diai	ORGANIZATION	.

		. -RRB-

		I have been a subscriber for and a thorough reader of The Dial for many years .

		As a review within its prescribed limits , I do not know one that is better .

		Your staff of critics is of the best .

		It is rarely -- very rarely -- that any reader can find a line in your columns that pricks or jars .

		In your last issue -LRB- Jxme 16 -RRB- , your reviewer of recent fiction uses a few words that I think call for explanation .

		They occur in the review of '' The Price of Silence , '' by Mrs.
M. E. M. Davis	PERSON	.

		The reviewer says -LRB- page sisO -RRB- : '' A document is in existence which seems to indicate that the most terrible of all disgraces -LRB- from the dis - torted Southern point of - s-iew -RRB- is hers ; in other words , that there is a slight infusion of negro blood in her veins . ''

		The words in parentheses , '' from the distorted Southern point of view , '' constitute the side-step -- yes , siAe-swipe -- of the reviewer that was not only inter alios but rather suggestive of an ethnic bias that I had never conceived as characteristic of The Dial .

		The whole parenthesis is an incongruous mosaic , but the word '' distorted '' is the equivoque I beg to have light thrown upon .

		That word is certainly ambiguous , and I doubt not that your reviewer will take pleasure in telling your Southern readers what was meant .

		That he may not be in doubt , nor think me sensitive above other men , including himself , I will put the door ajar for his appearance .

		The impression made on me by those foreign words is that the writer of them does not consider '' a slight infusion of negro blood '' as a serious objection to a woman when a man is looking around for a wife -- one who is to be his companion through life , and , maybe , the mother of his children .

		If this inference be imjust , it will not require many words to set me right .

		If just , I do not think that anyone will deny that the inference is logical .

		If the '' Southern view '' is distorted , then your re \ - iewer must be one of those at the North who do not object to a slight infusion of negro blood in a wife .

		It is needless to point out to any well-informed person that the '' Southern view '' your reviewer seems to deplore is unanimous and fixed .

		If , as he maintains , that view is '' distorted , '' and his view is the Northern view , then the gulf between the North and the South will remain wide open .

		There seems to be -LRB- and I say '' seems '' purposely -RRB- a strong current of fellowship set - ting in between the
North and South	LOCATION	; but they can never be bed-feUows so long as the North shall insist that the negro shall occupy the same bed .

		Should the North take the negro on its side , and on the outside , there might be a hope for rest and sleep ; but there can be neither rest nor sleep so long as the
North	ORGANIZATION	insists that the negro shall not only sleep in the tripartite bed , but shall lie next to the Southern man , and on the out - side -- the side away from the North .

		I may have said more than is necessary to my pur - pose , which is to request an explanation of this seeming fling at the South .

		I think this is due to your Southern readers , to The Dial , and to your reviewer .

		-LSB- We cheerfully give space to Judge
Norwood	PERSON	's communication , but can hardly open the gates for a discussion of the * ' ethnic bias '' which he suspects to be lurking in the background of the review com - plained of .

		The relations of the races in the South involve too large a problem to be opened in our columns by one small re ^ dew .

		The sentence quoted by our correspondent says -- outlining the plot of the book reviewed -- that a supposed '' slight infu - sion of negfTo blood '' in the veins of the heroine is regarded as '' the most terrible of all disgraces '' from the Southern point of view , and this view is called '' distorted . ''

		In other words , the view that an accident of birth for which an individual is in no way responsible could constitute '' the most terrible of all disgraces '' is one which is held to be not normal , or sound , or natural , or whatever is the opposite of `` distorted '' -- the word which our correspondent asks for light upon .

		The word • ' disgrace '' would seem to us the equivocal one , if any , in the sentence quoted .

		THE TROT PUBLIC LIBRARY .

		-LRB- To tie Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Referring to the communications in your issues of
April 1	DATE	-LRB- page 214 -RRB- and
May 1	DATE	-LRB- page 279 -RRB- , in regard to '' German and American Reading Habits , '' I would like to correct some inaccuracies in the figures printed in regard to the
Troy Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cost of the building has never been made public ; but during my stay in Troy , now of nearly two years ' duration , the most liberal estimate I have ever heard made on the cost of the building has never reached half the sum stated by your commentator , who also '' ventures to guess '' quite too large figures as to the size of the col - lection of books .

		The library is at present undergoing reorganization , and no one knows exactly how many volumes it contains , -- 40,000 b nearer the mark .

		As to the circulation , the report for
1906	DATE	, filed in the Regents ' office , shows a circulation of 84,732 vol - umes , not 62,000 as stated .

		Troy claims 79,000 popu - lation since the annexation of
Lansingburgh	LOCATION	, not 60,651 .

		As to the chief point of the communications -- a comparison of the reading habits of Germans and Americans -- in justice to Troy let me add that since the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has been more freely open to the people the circidation has increased rapidly .

		In
1904	DATE	, 32,123 volumes were circulated ; in
1905	DATE	, 68,998 ; in
1906	DATE	, 84,732 .

		The
1906	DATE	circulation includes that of the
Children 's Free Circulating Library	ORGANIZATION	, which has been moved into the building of the
Troy Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and is being run by it as the children 's department .

		The reading public of Troy is not limited to the use of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is an excellent library at the rooms of the Y ^ oung
Women 's Association	ORGANIZATION	, free to all , and two of the bookstores have large collections of books which they loan at the rate of
five cents	MONEY	a week .

		These collections , largely though not wholly fiction , are well patronized .

		A
True American Patriot	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The words '' patriot '' and '' patriotism '' have gained a wider meaning in these later days of aspiration toward universal peace and fraternal service .


Charles Russell LoweU	PERSON	, ending his life at twenty-nine years in gallant fighting at the battle of
Cedar Creek	LOCATION	, was a patriot in every phase of his life and of its high promise .


Cir	ORGANIZATION	- cumstances prevented him from revealing to the world the full measure of his patriotism .

		He has been recalled as a distinguished cavalry officer in the Civil War ; but the interpretation of his character by Dr.
Edward W. Emerson	PERSON	, and through
Lowell	PERSON	's letters , indicate the high hopes for yet greater service which he cherished from his youth and for which he had fitted him - self .

		Writing to his friend .

		Gen.
Francis C. Barlow	PERSON	, about a month before the fatal battle at
Cedar Creek	LOCATION	,
Lowell	PERSON	said : '' There are better things to be done in the Country ,
Barlow	PERSON	, than fighting , and you must save yourseK for them too .

		There are as many campaigns for a fellow as there are half years to his life . ''

		Lowell 's life-purpose , from youth , had been '' to raise the standard of life and thought of the workingmen of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		But he was called away , in his young manhood , to more urgent service in the war ; and while his active plans and work were thus ended , his influence survived among his associates , many of whom carried out to noble ends his ideals for social service and the up - lifting of his fellow-men .

		Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	has emphasized one special trait of
Lowell	LOCATION	, as a schoolboy , a mechanic , a railroad treasurer , and a military leader , -- '' power of concentration on the work of the moment . ''

		This ability made him a man of great value in every service which he undertook , and gave surety of his future leadership .

		In testunony of this , his biographer says : '' His new acquaintances believed that in him they had discovered a remarkable man , made for just that place .

		Yet all soon saw the performance of the work in hand was but a low power of a force dimly seen behind . ''

		Such qualities , known to his family and friends and now shown to the world of readers , might well have inspired his poet-uncle to those tender lines in the great '' Commemoration Ode , '' -- • The Life and Letters of
Charles Ehssbll Lowell	PERSON	.

		By
Edward W. Emerson	PERSON	.

		With portraits .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In these brave ranks I only see the gaps , Thinking of dear ones whom the dumb turf wraps , Dark to the triumph which they died to gain : Fitlier may others greet the living .

		For me the past is unforgiving ; I with uncovered head Salute the sacred dead .

		Who went , and who return not .

		-- Say not so ! '

		T is not the grapes of Canaan that repay , But the high faith that failed not by the way . ''

		By far the lai ` ger part of this volume is given to letters from
Lowell	LOCATION	to his family and inti - mate friends ; but these are preceded by a brief comprehensive sketch of his life , by Dr.
Emer	PERSON	- son , which is admirable in its dignity and effectiveness .

		Abundant notes supplement both the life-study and the letters ; to these notes are confided many of the most intimate revelations of the young soldier 's personality .

		In all his relations with men , -- in the rolling-mills where he was studying the manufacture of iron , in his responsible position as treasurer of a Western railroad , and in the army , -- he carefully studied human nature and tried to uplift his associates .

		From subordinates he exacted faithful , often severe , labor ; but he never asked of them more devotion than he himself gave to the same cause , always cheerily , and with no false hopes of reward , often saying , '' Nothing can repay a man for what he has done well , -- except the doing of it . ''

		When the Civil War was imminent ,
Lowell	PERSON	was just entering upon what promised much satisfaction to his courageous nature , for he had been called to manage some unprofitable iron - works in
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		The attack on
Massa	PERSON	^ chusetts soldiery in
Baltimore	LOCATION	roused his militant spirit ; and although he often expressed regret at the war , yet his sense of the duty of the hour called him to the army .

		Here he served as a captain in the
Sixth United States Cavalry	LOCATION	, and later was chosen to raise and command , as
Colonel	ORGANIZATION	, the
Second Massachusetts Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	.

		For a short time he was in
McClellan	PERSON	's
Penin	LOCATION	- sular campaign , then was among those guarding the
Potomac	LOCATION	, and finally was in active service in the
Shenandoah Valley	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	, with the aid of reminiscences and letters from
Lowell	LOCATION	's orderlies as well as his superior officers , has presented a vivid picture of this valiant soldier , almost rash in his bravery , modest in accounts of his own part , but emphasizing the courage of others , or deploring the injuries to his horses -- for he had thirteen horses shot under him in as many weeks .

		The final scene in his life , after his fii ` st wound at
Cedar Creek	LOCATION	, is told with sympathetic skill .

		Refusing to be taken from the field after the return of
Sheridan	PERSON	, he was
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 mounted on his horse for his last charge , and gave his orders in whispers , but with no waning of spirit or determination .

		With justice .

		Gen. ``
Weslev Merritt	PERSON	.

		his immediate commander , said , '' A more gallant soldier never buckled sabre . ''

		Combined with the valor and practical effi - ciency of
Lowell	LOCATION	's nature was a true refinement , shown especially through his letters .

		As a boy , he was an excellent scholar ; and he never lost his scholarly habits .

		After the day 's work in mill or office , he spent his evenings among his books , sharing this plea-sure with others who were less favored .

		Writing to his mother from
Burlington	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, where he was acting as a rail ^ - ay official , he said : '' I am contented here perfectly : but man does not live by bread alone , he must have human sympathy , real or imagined .

		Do I ever read a canto of Spenser , or of Chap - man 's stout old Odyssey , without thinking fifty times how you would relish this or that , and fancying your sympathy ? ''

		Again , he asked for

		During the months which he was obliged to spend abroad in search of health , he kept his courage strong , wrote interesting de - scriptions of unusual scenes in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Algiers	LOCATION	, and seemed to enjoy life , in spite of ill - health , with a zest and humorous insight which suggest
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The letters in this volume are carefully chosen to show the varied traits of
Lowell	LOCATION	at different periods of his life , and also to reveal his sym - pathetic qualities as son , husband , and friend .

		Yet the more intimate personal sentences are omitted , for the editor evidently holds the sane opinion that such passages are too sacred for publication .

		One of
Lowell	LOCATION	's true friend-s was Colonel
Robert G. Shaw	PERSON	, whose heroic death in command of his negro regiment has been duly c-ommemorate < l in sculpture opposite the
State House	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		C-olonel
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's sister
Josephine	PERSON	became the wife of
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		They passed a few weeks of happy life together in camp in
Virginia	LOCATION	, before the soldier was sent into action .

		The letters to his wife , selected for this book , are full of cheery and often illuminating comments upon scenery and events , with im - pressions of his companions , and plans for their life of happy usefulness after the war .

		IVIrs .

		Lowell died two years ago .

		Throughout her long life she interpreted and fulfilled , in large measure , the hopes and purposes of her husband for the betterment of social conditions in the country which he loved and for which he gave his life .

		A close bond of friendship existed between
Colonel Lowell	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Henry Lee Higginson	PERSON	, dating from their school-days .

		Many letters to the latter are included , wherein are blended humor , earnest inquiries for his friends welfare , and philosophic comments upon life , which emphasize Mr.
Hi	PERSON	^ inson 's notes of memory regarding
Lowell	PERSON	's earlier philosophic habits of mind .

		One of the most self-revealing passages in these letters of this far-seeing and aspiring soldier is the following , written to Mr.
Higgin	PERSON	- son in
September of 1864	DATE	: '' Do n't grow rich ; if you once beg-in , you will find it much more difficult to be a useful citizen .

		The useful j citizen is a mighty unpretending hero .

		But we are not going to have any Country very long unless such hero - ism is developed .

		There !

		what a stale sermon I 'm preaching ; but being a soldier , it does seem to me that I should like nothing else so well as being a useful citizen .

		That 's modest , is it not ?

		-- well , trying to be I one , I mean . ''

		j The student of American history and litera ^ ture may well be grateful for this record , so 1 directlv ` and fuUy told , of a life which is as I mspirmg m memory as it was m companionsmp .

		Thronsh the testimony of the friends of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's youth and manhood , in school , m active civic life , and in the army , the reader recognizes the nobility of this '' lost leader , '' and echoes the words of one who knew him well : '' He was upright as a man , pure as a patriot , and emi - nently free from the finesse of the politician .

		Young in years , he died too early for his country . ''

		12 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, English edition In four volumes , far handsomer than the old ones .

		Besides all the old illustra - tions from woodcuts and photographs , each of the new volumes contains about a dozen full-page plates in color -- a fine gallery in themselves .

		At the same time , another work by Dr.
Muther	PERSON	is offered by an American translator and an American publisher , in two volumes , -- '' The History of Painting , from the Fourth to the early
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Although deal - ing with the earlier period -LRB- ending where the other begins -RRB- , this is the newer book , having been wi-itten in
1900	DATE	but now translated for the first time .

		Naturally , these works are much alike in style and purpose , which the author thus explains : '' These volumes do not constitute a text-book of the history of painting .

		The author has not luidertaken to present the biographies of the artists or descriptions of their pictures .

		For the reader who is interested in such personal and descriptive records the material will be found available in a number of authoritative works .

		The present purpose is rather to explain from the psychology -LRB- so to speak -RRB- of each period its dominant style and to interpret the works of art as ' human docu - ments . ' ''

		It is in the work covering the earlier period that the application of this purpose -- to inter - pret the great masters thi-ough a study of the times and circimistances imder which they arose -- is most marked and consistent .

		For example ,
Savonarola	PERSON	is characterized a.s `` the speaking-tube of his time , proclaiming with loud voice what others had felt in silence . ''

		Like - wise , his contemporaries among the painters -- Piero di
Cosimo	PERSON	,
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Filippino Lippi	PERSON	,
Crivelli	PERSON	,
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	,
Memling	LOCATION	, etc. -- are part and parcel of the great religious reaction that swept over
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Thus it comes about that some painters usually considered secondary step into imexijected prominence .

		Piero della
Francesca	PERSON	is one of these . ''

		Impressionism , '' first heard of by that name about twenty years ago , is traced directly from him .

		A true fore - runner of this modem school of art , it is shown that four hundred years ago this painter set forth the problem of realism and endeavored to show in what manner atmosphere changes color impressions .

		Born in the little town of
Borgo San Sepolcro	LOCATION	in the midst of the Umbrian plain , it was natural that he should attempt a solution of this problem .

		While artists who labored in densely populated and closely built cities were accustomed to observe near objects with sharpened vision ,
Piero	LOCATION	, standing on the hill of his native town , saw only light and space .

		He saw the sun as it brooded over the valley and bathed objects , now in the splendor of the
morning	TIME	, now in the quivering light of noon , now in the soft twil - light .

		Narrowed by no limit , his eye swept over numbei ` less hills into infinite space .

		The two problems of space and light became there - fore the chief objects of his life .

		Next to
Piero deUa Francesca	PERSON	,
Mantegna	PERSON	is credited with the greatest influence upon the artistic activity of the younger generation .

		He was the first to give figures their full plastic rotundity ; the earliest to create perspective ceiling decorations , to make portrait groups , to raise the study of the nude in motion and of draperies to a real artistic problem .

		The Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes is made a prominent factor in the evolution of the Florentine school ; his painting of the altar-piece for the hospital of
Santa Maria Nuova	ORGANIZATION	in
Florence	LOCATION	is regarded as the greatest event in Florentine art annals between the years
1460	DATE	and
1470	DATE	.

		To find Piero della
Francesca	PERSON	,
Mantegna	PERSON	, and Van der Goes , singled out as the epoch-makers in the very century where
Masaccio	PERSON	has so long been conceded nearly the whole of the stage , is startling to a degree .

		The psychological contrast between the quat - trocento and the cinquencento is very happily illustrated by reminding the reader of the change of type in the
Madonna	LOCATION	. ''

		In place of the umUla , which had been the ideal of the age of
Savonarola	LOCATION	, maesta now appears .

		If formerly
Mary	PERSON	's hair was covered by a gloomy matron 's veil , she is now clad in princely garments .

		If she had for - merly been the devoted handmaiden of the Lord , and later in the works of
Correggio	LOCATION	a woman of the world , she has now become a queen of heaven .

		Neither mel - ancholy nor tenderness beams from her eye ; but proud and distinguished , lofty and unapproachable , she glances down from above .

		An odor di regina pervades her being .

		Tlie complete absence of the motive of the nursing
Madomia	LOCATION	, to which the age of Leonardo had imparted a slight tendency toward the sensual , must likewise be attributed to these conceptions of dig ^ nity and princely majesty . ''

		Thus it continued during the time of
Leo X.	PERSON	, when the gods of
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	had taken complete possession of the Christian heaven , even Christ himself becoming but a beautiful Olympian .

		So Hellenic a taste did not wish to see its gods bleed and suffer .

		Then came the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	, which found the art of the Renaissance objectionable because it did not adequately I ^ ortray the self-sacrificing spirit of the martyrs .

		The art-hating , fanatical , and puritanic spii-it thus created at the beginning of the seventeenth century dominated what is here called the Counter-reformation .

		As the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	had

		THE DIAL .

		13 praised the power of the human body to enjoy , so the Counter-reformation glorified its power to suffer .

		Pictures of Christ crowned with thorns , and of the
Mater Dolorosa	LOCATION	, from the central figure , and the legends of the saints were searched for the most shocking deeds of blood .

		Poison , dagger , and cord , drawing , strangling , burning , -- all such subjects were represented .

		St.
Andrew	PERSON	is nailed to the cross ,
St. Simon	ORGANIZATION	struck with a club , St.
Stephen	PERSON	stoned , and
St. Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	disembowelled .

		The whole technique of the torture-chamber is re - vealed , and instruction is given in all the accessories of the Inquisition .

		The seventeenth century , however , made a noble record by developing a series of mightj ' portrait-jjainters --
Velasquez	PERSON	.


Frans Hals	PERSON	, and
Kembrandt	PERSON	.

		It was in
Holland	LOCATION	that the siui of a new day arose , the sun which still illumines the world .

		Art no longer shines only upon the eyes of
Mary	PERSON	and
the Hosts of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	; it settles upon arid country lulls , streams upon the sea waves , is at home in peasants ' houses and the dark woods , wanders through the streets and alleys , makes a temple of every market .

		Also the religious sentiments which stirred
Protestant Holland	ORGANIZATION	had to find appropriate expression ; the living essence of Biblical subjects was released from a narrow ecclesiastical sphere , and ap - proached anew with all the deep German intro - spectiveness .

		These tendencies were all united in Rembrandt -- perhaps of all masters , since the Christian era , the mightiest proclaimer of the great Pan ; to him the cosmic powers of light and air signified the divinity - that
Michael Angelo	PERSON	had painted under a beautiful human form .

		In tracing the evolution of modem painting .

		Dr.
Muther	PERSON	finds his task more varied and complicated , just as modem life itself is more complicated and varied than that of any pre - vious age .

		But he employs the same prin - ciple -- namely , that the art of every period appears as its • • mirror and abstract chronicle . ''

		He does not accede tj the dicttun , repeated so often as to become a commonplace , that the nineteenth c * entury has '' no style , '' and the whole purpose of his four volumes is to show that modern art has a distinctive style , and to make clear the logic and sequence of its evolu - tion .

		The question is , what new element the age brought into the history of art , not what it borrowed eclectically from earlier ages .

		The change that has taken place in the fundamental conditions of society has called upon art to express itself in a form different from that of any earlier time .

		Formerly , the chief supporters of art were the two leading powers of Church and
King	LOCATION	.

		The most noted works of
Raphael	PERSON	and 3 *
Iichael Angelo	PERSON	, of
Valasquez	PERSON	and
Murillo	PERSON	, of Rubens and
Van Dyck	PERSON	, were executed either for the churches or for the reigning princes of their country .

		The patron of modem art is the citizen ; the old culture of the clerics and aristocrats has been superseded by that of the middle classes .

		Fngland plays the pioneer part in this development , with the advantage of ha ^ Tng no old traditions to stand in its way .

		It had no great past .

		The plebeian paintings of
Hogarth	PERSON	laid the foundations ; it was the quick eye of
Hogarth	PERSON	that discovered the new He looked out upon the life surround - wav .

		ing him , with its manifold idiosyncrasies , and proudly felt himself the son of a new age , in which rigid conventional forms were every - where penetrated by the modem ideas of free thought , the rights of man , conformity to nature in morals and manners .

		The world which con - fronted him he depicted truly as it was , in all its beauty and all its ugliness .

		With him was the origin of modem art - It was about the middle of the eighteenth century when English influences b ^ an to fer - tilize the Continent .

		The truth and nattiralness of English ideas were introduced as models , and
England	LOCATION	became in her whole culture the school - mistress of the Continent .

		The authors -- some in the field of poetry only , others in the whole sphere of intellectual life -- were leaders in the battle for liberty against fossilized tradition .

		In the province of art , it was ordained that the most powerful figure should be bom in the most mediasval country in
Europe	LOCATION	, on Spanish soil .

		Against an art that was more catholic than Catholicism , courtly and mystical , there came by far the greatest reaction in
Francesco Groya	PERSON	.

		Spanish art , which began in a blind piety , be - comes in
Goya	ORGANIZATION	revolutionary , free , modem .

		Goya is , in his whole nature , a modem man , a resdess , feverish soul , nervous as a decadent , temperamental to his finger-tips .

		His style in portraiture , his art of composition , his whole method , speak to our artists to-day in a language easily imderstood .

		One of the most fascinating figures of the beginning of the century , his pictures , whether they be violent or eccentric , tender or hard , gloomy or joyous , nearly always move and palpitate with life , and they always keep their charm .

		Thus the author proceeds , singling out die epoc-h-making personalities in each coimtry and at each period , concluding with a survey of present-day art .

		To Americans , it will be of 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, special interest to read what this brilliant and discriminating authority has to say about American art . ''

		What is striking in all American pictures is their eminent technical ability .

		There is displayed in these pictures a strenuous discipline of talent , an effort to probe the subject as artistically as possible , a thorough - ness seldom equalled even by the ' thoroughness ' of the Germans .

		And technique being the basis of every art , the groundwork for the growth of a specially American school has been thus created ... Yet even those Americans who work in their native land betray an accent less national than the
Danes	LOCATION	, for example , or the Dutch ; and national accent they can not have , because the entire civilization of
America	LOCATION	, far more than that of other countries , is exposed to international influences . ''

		The excellent bibliography and the Index of Artists are additional merits of these exhaustive , original , and sumptuous volumes .

		Science and Humanity .

		* '' The Kingdom of Man , '' by Professor
E. Ray Lankester	PERSON	, Director of the
Natural History Department	ORGANIZATION	of the British Museum , is not , as its title might indicate , an anthropological treatise , but rather a group of three very interesting and striking essays on scientific subjects , especially as related to the needs and interests of humanity .

		The first is the Romanes lecture at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1905	DATE	, and is a judicious , trenchant , and forceful plea that the English universities abandon the compvdsory study of Greek and Latin and make the study of Nature an integral and .

		predom - inant part of every man 's education .

		`` The knowledge and control of Nature , '' says Pro- fessor
Lankester	PERSON	, `` is Man 's destiny and his greatest need .

		To enable future leaders of the community to comprehend this , to perceive what the knowledge and control of Nature are , and what are the steps by which they are gained and increased , is the duty of a great university .

		To neglect this is to retard the approach of well - being and happiness , and to injure humanity . ''

		The second essay is an outline of the advance in science ma < le in the
last quarter	DATE	of a century , being the presidential address at the recent meeting of the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	for the Ad - vancement of Science .

		With a bold hand , Pro- fessor

		the biological sciences , and in the study of di.sease .

		One finds here a brief but lucid treatment of such matters of common interest as radium , the
Becquerel	PERSON	rays , the canals of Mai-s , the okapi , the larval eel , radiobes , De Vries 's mutation theory , malaria , the '' sleeping sickness , '' etc. .

		The author laments the fact that '' there is by no means a corresponding ' advancement ' of Science in that signification of the word which implies the increase of the influence of science in the life of the community , the increase of the support given to it and of the desire to aid in its progress , to discover and then to encourage and reward those who are specially fitted to increase scientific knowledge , and to bring it to bear so as to promote the weKare of the com - munity . ''

		He believes this neglect of Science , and the questionable treatment of scientific men by administrative departments of the govern - ment , is due to the defective non-scientific edu - cation of the governing class in
England	LOCATION	, and to the racial dislike among all classes to the establishment and support by public fimds of posts which can only be filled by men of special training and ability , and not by the candidates of popular clamor or class pri \ ` ilege .

		The organ - ization and technical character of scientific work , together with the widely prevalent and easily accessible forms of manufactured gaiety , are , in the author 's opinion , the causes of the con - siderable falling off of popidar interest in mat - tei 'S scientific , and the disappearance of the formerly numerous class of amateur naturalists .

		The closing essay , on the '' Sleeping Sick - ness '' which is now devastating tropical
Africa	LOCATION	and bids fair to become the third great plague of the ra `` e , would make a splendid tract for the propaganda now at work in this country to bring about the establishment of a
Department of Public Health	ORGANIZATION	coordinate with the other departments in the Cabinet at
Washington	LOCATION	. ''

		Medicine is organized in this country by its practitioners as a fee-paid profession ; but as a necessary and invaluable branch of the public service it is neglected , misunderstood , and rendered to a large extent futUe by inadequate funds and consequent lack of capable leatlers .

		The defiant desperate battle civilized man wages with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	must go on ; but man `` s suffering and loss in the struggle -- the delay in his idtimate triumph -- depend solely on how much or how little the great civilized communities of the world seek for increased knowledge of Nature as the basis of their practical adminis - tration and government .

		* Two years and a half have now passed since the publication of the first volume of the notable histor - ical series entitled • ' The
American Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' and a year has gone by since the appearance of those volumes which were last reviewed in The Dial .

		In this interval , eight instalments have been added , which cover roughly a half-century of our national history -- from
1819	DATE	to
1865	DATE	.

		In `` The Rise of
American Nationality	ORGANIZATION	, '' by President
Babcock	PERSON	.

		previously reviewed in The Dial , the historj - of the
United States	LOCATION	had been brought down to the new problems that presented themselves at the close of the second war with
England	LOCATION	.

		It is with the fuller discussion of these new problems that Professor
Turner	PERSON	begins liis ' ■ Rise of the New West , '' which forms the four - teenth volume of the series .

		The first chapters treat of the sections , the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	,
Middle	ORGANIZATION	, and
Southern States	LOCATION	, as yet marked off by ec-onomic lines rather than by conscious political differences .

		One finds a fresh and penetrating analysis of the religious influences which were re-shaping
New England	LOCATION	thought After this the author reviews the material conditions of the central coast states , which were the most democratic of all the seaboard states , but were already under the leadership of professional politicians like Van Biu-en .

		He then takes up the old South , with the economic decline of the tidewater section , and with the losses sus - tained through the migration of the enterprising to the `` West or to
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		He marks the analogy between the economic sectionalism developed within the individual states and that which later helped to isolate the South from the rest of the
Union	LOCATION	; and stops to comment upon the political ability with which the statesmsn of the South developed the defense of their interests .

		All this is but preUminarj - , however , to the central theme of the volume , which is the development of the West -- the land of the frontier .

		of economic development , such as the sale of the public lands , and the banking experiments of the western commonwealths ; and the social conditions , both in the nearer and the farther West .

		Through - out the book .

		also , the author keeps clearly before the reader the relation of the g ^ at party leaders to each other , and the personal rivahy that grew out of the '' era of good feeling . ''

		The account of the elections of
1820	DATE	and
1824	DATE	is eminently clear , as is also the discussion of single topics , such as the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise .

		The transition from this volume to that of Pro- fessor
MacDonald	ORGANIZATION	on • ' Jacksonian Democracy '' involves some repetition , for in Professor
Turner	PERSON	's book
Jackson	PERSON	appears as having been long in politics , while the new volume goes back to his earlier career : even
Jefferson	PERSON	's notice of Jackson '' choking with rage '' appears again .

		But soon the narrative reaches
Jackson	PERSON	's election to the Presidency , from which point his administration serves to bind together the various movements of the next eight years .

		The personal politics which distinguished
Jackson	PERSON	's con - trol of affairs , the use of the patronage , the fights over internal improvements , public lands , the tariff , nullification , and particularly the
Bank of the United	ORGANIZATION	.

		States .

		-- these , with
Jackson	PERSON	's diplomatic success , form , of course , the chief subjects of the book .

		There Ls also a very interesting though crowded chapter on the life of the States in
Jadkson	LOCATION	's time , as apart from that of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		In any work on
Jackson	PERSON	's period , the most inter - esting if not the most essential part is sure to be dje author 's estimate of
Jackson	PERSON	himself , of his motives , his personal judgments , -- in short , of his place in history .

		The volume before us is fortunately free from the prejudice that mars so able a book as
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	's Life of .

		Jackson .

		Of
Jackson	PERSON	,
Professor MacDonald	ORGANIZATION	tells us that `` in a coarse and corrupt society , a society whose moral standards were lax beyond anj-thing that would be tolerated now ,
Jackson	PERSON	retained a singfular purity of life , thought , and speech . ''

		The charge that his state papers were written for him .

		Professor
MacDonald	PERSON	questions , after comparing the rough drafts with the finished letters and speeches .

		On the other hand , `` his quarrels , which attained political significance , par - ticularly the
Eaton	PERSON	and
Calhoun	PERSON	affairs , were such as only a mind at once narrow , vindictive and intense could have prosecuted . ''

		His second admin - istration `` shows deterioration in personal ways , '' and '' he not seldom posed before the public for mere popular effect '' Yet he ♦ ■ retained to the last in the main , his extraordinary hold on the popular mind . ''

		Of unclear thinking , yet with '' the intui - tion of woman rather than the rea.son of man , '' he nevertheless '' had hold of the right end of the mat - ter in every one of the great issues of his adminis - tration . ''

		Finally , in this volume our attention is ^ ain called to the emergence of the West as a dis - tinct and influential factor in national politics , and to
Jackson	PERSON	as the embodiment of Western ideals .

		The next volume holds a unique place in the 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, series , in that the course of the general narrative is for the first time interrupted to devote ahnost an entire volume to a special topic , Slavery and Abolition .

		The editor of the series has , moreover , reserved this topic for his own handling , -- a fact which , in view of Professor
Hart	PERSON	's well-known interest in and investigation of this subject , is significant of the importance which he attributes to this instalment .

		The first three chapters present a general sketch of the social , intellectual , and economic conditions of the
United States	LOCATION	about
1830	DATE	, and include an account of the earlier phases of railroad-building .

		The six chapters which follow deal with slavery , -- the system , the Southern whites , the free negroes , the plantation life , the control , and the sale of slaves .

		In the next seven chapters we find the arguments for and against slavery , -- first the Southern defense , then the various forms of anti-slavery doctrine .

		From this the author proceeds to the question of slave revolts , fugitive slaves , the Underground Railway , and the relation of the movement to the interest of the slaveholdei '' .

		With the seventeenth chapter the treatment passes to a legal phase .

		After chapters on anti-slavery in the States and in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, we reach the problems of the interstate and international relations of slavery .

		There is a single chapter upon the politics and finance of
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	's administra - tion , and the book closes with a discussion of the results of abolition .

		What may some day be the most valuable infor - mation concerning slavery now lies hid in planta - tion records , local tax-books , and journals of minor courts .

		Apart from this inaccessible material , the sources upon which Professor
Hart	PERSON	has drawn are numerous and varied .

		Perhaps the greatest weight is laid upon the accounts of travellers -LRB- with Olmsted facile princeps -RRB- of which , in the bibliographical appendix , an extensive and valuable list is given .

		While the cumulative effect of such testimony is very great , it must be conceded that careful weigh - ing is necessary , especially when outsiders describe the domestic concerns of another people .

		Tocque - ville , for example , is quoted for his opinion on the incompatibility of slavery with democracy .

		There is considerable testimony , however , to the existence of such a democracy , and another dictum of Tocque - ville , that the Union '' is an accident that will last only so long as circumstances favor it , '' would perhaps be discounted to some degree by Professor
Hart	PERSON	.

		Another gi'oup of sources comprises the pamphlet literature that continually increased in bulk , the bitter attacks and the multiform defenses that were put forth .

		A third body consists of the slave codes of the various States .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	has studied with care the history of the
Virginia	LOCATION	Convention of 1829-30 , and has noted the erroneous impression that a bill to abolish slavery failed by a single vote .

		It would have been interesting to add to this an account of the debates in other
States	LOCATION	, about the same time , wherein is revealed the seriousness with which the positions of the slaves and of the free blacks were then considered .

		To
Benjamin Lundy	PERSON	, Professor
Hart	PERSON	ascribes the credit of being the first abolitionist journalist .

		This may be practically true ; but
Elihu Embree	PERSON	's establishment , in
1820	DATE	, at
Jonesborough	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, of '' The Emancipator , '' should be noticed , even though
Embree	ORGANIZATION	's work was short-lived .

		This omis - sion is of slight importance , however , in view of the discriminating history of the anti-slavery and aboli - tion movements , in their various ramifications , which follows .

		The author shows how Garrison jipheld the extreme view , urging the eradication not only of slavery but of all the laws , discriminations , social customs , and practices , which bore against the negro race .

		The refusal of the abolitionists to enter the territory of their opponents , as the Quakers entered
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and their preference for agitation at long range , is offset by the refusal of the South to tolerate discussion within its borders , -- a limitation of speech which Professor
Hart	PERSON	holds up as one of the weakest points in the logical armor of the South , however great its practical necessity may have been considered .

		On the economic injury of slavery to the owners , and to the South as a whole , everyone is to-day agreed .

		On the benefit or injury of it to the negro himself , there are still different opinions .

		There is of course no question in Professor
Hart	PERSON	's mind , and he repeatedly places the slave defense in logical difficulty with the assertion that as a race the negro could not be at the same time '' a brute and a happy serf , a criminal and a family friend . ''

		There lies here apossible/aMacia accidentis ; and , years after - ward , the sad paradox comes sometimes so near to being the truth as to grieve and worry those who have at heart the welfare of the freedman .

		Regard - ing the negro 's economic incapacity and the differ - ence in wealth between
North and South	LOCATION	, Professor
Hart	PERSON	is constrained to admit that '' the experience of the last forty years has shown that slavery was not a complete explanation .

		The negro could not be made as efficient as the intelligent , well rewarded and productive labor of the North , simply by set - ting him free .

		The South , '' he rightly adds , '' was equally mistaken in insisting that slavery was the only thing that made the negro efficient : it was clinging to a cast-iron and rigid system which
America	LOCATION	had outgrown . ''

		With respect to accumulating new facts and presenting judgments based on fresh investigation , no volume of the series surpasses the '' Westward Extension '' of Professor
Garrison	PERSON	, who for many years has been identified with the work of the collection , publication , and study of the Spanish and other archives of
Texas	LOCATION	.

		The author 's style , how - ever , lacks the fascination that has marked the writing of some of the volumes ; and it seems to us that the political side has been developed to the exclusion of social and economic life .

		The theme of the book is Expansion , which links it in a way to that of Professor
Turner	PERSON	; while the importance of the slavery controversy during the decade

		THE DIAL 17 succession to that of Professor
Hart	PERSON	.

		In his second chapter .

		Professor Gan-ison describes the field for expansion , - which consisted of
Oregon	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, and
Texas	LOCATION	.

		In later chapters , the author tells us of the adjustment of the
Oregon	LOCATION	and
Maine	LOCATION	con - troversies , and of the negotiations for an Isthmian canal .

		There are two or three chapters on general politics .

		Beyond this , the work is wholly devoted to
Texas	LOCATION	and to the Mexican War .

		In the opinion of Professor
Grarrison	PERSON	, the documentary evidence entirely disproves the idea that the colonists of
Texas	LOCATION	went thither to establish slavery in that country , or that the
Texas	LOCATION	revolution was brought about priraai-ily by influences working from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He presents , also , a strong defence of President
Tyler	PERSON	in the latter 's quarrel with the Whigs , rejecting the theory that
Tyler	PERSON	was moved either by flattery or by personal pique , and holding that he was actuated in the main by courage and consistency , and that he acted as a '' brave and determined believer in
State	LOCATION	rights . ''

		A third divergence from older views is found in the chapter on the rupture with
Mexico	LOCATION	, where Polk 's conclusion that the boundarj ' of
Texas	LOCATION	extended southward to the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	is shown to have rested not only on the doubtful Texan statute of
1836	DATE	.

		but also on the treaty which
Santa Anna	LOCATION	had concluded while a prisoner in the hands of the Texans .

		Consequently ,
Polk	LOCATION	himself considered the advance of Taylor to the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	, not as an invasion , but as a reannexation .

		When we add to these points Professor
Garrison	PERSON	's extended rehabil - itation of the
Slidell	LOCATION	mission to
Mexico	LOCATION	, his argu - ment that her rejection of
Slidell	LOCATION	put
Mexico	LOCATION	in the wrong , his suggestion that the
Wilmot	PERSON	Proviso was simply '' a manoeuvre for political advantage in a family quarrel among the Democrats , '' and his contention that the Compromise of
1850	DATE	, though it did not prevent war , is nevertheless redeemed in history by the opportunity it afforded for the trans - continental expansion of the American States .

		-- when we consider all these propositions , backed by the weight of long research , it will be agreed that this volume is one of the most original in the series .

		The aftermath of the famous Compromise is revealed by
Professor Smith	ORGANIZATION	, in the volume on • ' Parties and Slavery . ''

		It begins with a discus - sion of the finality of this measure , so devotedly urged by the old Union-loving leaders North and South , and so unreal in the outcome .

		There foUows a very clear analysis of the parties and party leader - ship of the fifties , contrasting ' • Clay ,
Webster	PERSON	.

		Adams , and above all others ,
Calhoun	PERSON	, who had no love for office-broking , '' and the rising generation of party leaders , of whom
Davis	PERSON	,
Toombs	PERSON	,
Seward	LOCATION	,
Chase	ORGANIZATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Douglas	PERSON	'' alike considered the filling of oflices with personal and party friends as the natural course of events . ''

		Besides the develop - ment of the spoils system , another feature of the new politics of the decade was the appearance of corruption , which is connected with the influx of foreign immigrants .

		The central feature of the work is the
Kansas	LOCATION	-
Nebraska	LOCATION	affair .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	has made a careful study of
Douglas	PERSON	and the evolution of the doctrine of popular sovereignty .

		The results of this doctrine , the organized immigration from
New England	LOCATION	, the Missourian retort of fraud and intim - idation , the illegal voting and the extreme pro- slavery action of the
Shawnee Mission	LOCATION	legislature , were utterly beyond the imagination of the senators and representatives who voted for the bill in
1854	DATE	.

		The surprise of the
Eastern Anti-Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	men at the action of the Free-State men in
Kansas	LOCATION	, the political situation thus created , and the imminent danger of war , explain the necessity which arose for some sort of Federal action .

		The outcome of the policy which
Buchanan	PERSON	adopted and his mistake in risking all on the effort to force in
Kansas	LOCATION	as open to slavery , and the consideration of
Douglas	PERSON	's victory in
Illinois	LOCATION	, lead to the final verdict upon
Buchanan	PERSON	, -- that '' no president has a record of more hopeless ill-success . ''

		The book closes with what is really a psycho - logical study of the • ' Northern ferment '' and '' Southern sectionalism '' of the time , -- titles which partisans of that day might have reversed .

		Before these concluding chapters .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	has found space for an excellent discussion of the wider social and economic phenomena of the era , -- the railroad building of the fifties , the enormous land - grants of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the lavish stimulation of the states , the expansion of agriculture and manu - factures , of ship-building , mining , banking , and foreign trade , -- together with a brief discussion of foreign affairs and finance .

		Separate chapters treat of the panic of
1857	DATE	and of the Dred
Scott	PERSON	decision .

		In passing from
Professor Smith	ORGANIZATION	's book to the next in the series , one naturally expects a direct continuation of the narrative ; but Admiral
Chad	PERSON	- wick 's volume , with the modest title ' • Causes of the Civil War , '' spends the first four chapters in a review of the preceding ground , a discussion of • ` Southern nationalization , '' a description of the slave-holding South , an apology for
Douglas	PERSON	, and a long indictment of
Calhoun	PERSON	.

		In view of the various prefaces and summaries of both the authors and the editor , so liberally distributed through the former volumes , this seems rather supererogatorj ' , and the account is hardly so impartial as the general tone of the series would demand .

		The fifth chapter tells the story of the raid of
John Brown	PERSON	, with fuU reali - zation of
Brown	PERSON	's enthusiasm , and with condemna - tion both for the misdirection of this enthusiasm and for the g ^ Ut of the men of saner mind who lent their aid to the plan .

		With regard to the elec - tion of
1860	DATE	, the author stresses the large Southern vote opposed to
Breckinridge	PERSON	and
Lane	PERSON	, and con - siders the decision to secede as forced upon the people by their leaders .

		The next phase is an extensive survey of
Buchanan	PERSON	's last months , with the futile attempts at compromise .

		After a careful discussion of the establishment of IS THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, the Confederate government at
Montgomery	ORGANIZATION	, and of the Constitution of tlie
Confederate States	LOCATION	, Ad - miral
Chadwick	PERSON	turns to the second attempt at com - promise , known as the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, noting the disappointment of the country at large , and espe - cially the border states , at the resolute and unyield - ing spirit of the leaders in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rest of the book constitutes a detailed study of the rein - forcement of Sumter , the attitude of President Lincoln , and the negotiations concerning the evac - uation of the fort .

		The strictures of Southern sym - pathizers upon the candor of the administration are met with the statement that
Seward	PERSON	, in his assurance that the fort would he evacuated , acted without the knowledge or consent of President Lincoln .

		The last chapter tells of the bombardment .

		From the weary tale of preliminaries it is a relief to tui-n to the narrative of action .

		In the two vol - umes entitled '' The Appeal to Arms '' and '' The Outcome of the Civil War , '' which Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	con - tributes to the series , we have a model of what historical writing ought to be .

		Of the technical accuracy of military history , it is rash for a layman to judge ; but those who , on particular points , may differ from Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	must admit that his opinions are expressed not only with caution but with the utmost freedom from bias .

		While the greater part of these volumes deals with fighting , Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	has studied with care the material bases necessary to support the war .

		The service of the Engineer corps , the development of the
Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and
Stanton	PERSON	's energetic control of details , receive due appreciation ; while finance and general politics are not neglected .

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	writes with some detail of the suffering in the South .

		In one point his opinion seems to us at fault : in describing the Southern indignation at
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's
New Orleans	LOCATION	order concerning the treatment of women , he says that '' the usual treatment of such persons was confine - ment in the calaboose or lockup , and neither
Butler	PERSON	nor his soldiers had any other intention . ''

		It was hardly the actual punishment that was resented .

		Another topic perhaps insufficiently handled is the influence of immigration in swelling the numbers of the Northern armies .

		But as we suggested of the Jacksonian era , so in the case of the Civil War , we are perhaps most interested in estimates of disputed matters , -- such , for example , as the failure of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee	PERSON	's rela - tion to Longstreet and to
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	, or the question of the burning of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		On these moot points , and on such others as the prison con - troversy .

		Professor
Hosmer	PERSON	gives both sides , and presents his own opinion with dignity .

		Finally , in no way does the author 's ability to rise to the tragic power of his great subject appear more brilliantly manifest than in the characterizations which he has given us of the leaders of the War , of
Grant	LOCATION	, of Chase , and of a score of others , -- above all , of the two heroic figui'es ,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	.

		The publication of these volumes in the order of their chronology conduces to the advantage of the series .

		The writers of all the later volumes have had ample time for the preparation and construction of their work , which shows almost none of the evi - dences of haste that marred some of the earlier volumes .

		The typography continues to be most satisfactory , though a strange exception is found where , in his own book , pater potestas escapes the editor 's eye .

		As the series progresses , and the periods assigned to the several volumes are made shorter , each author has greater opportunity for detail , till in the last of the volumes just reviewed only two or three years are covered .

		Thus all the defects and merits of the cooperative system are exaggerated ; on the one hand , each period is han - dled by one supposed to be an expert ; on the other , there are many repetitions that would be avoided in the work of a single hand , and that seemingly defy the linking process undertaken by the editor .

		It is indeed questionable whether the series as a whole is not too large for the general reader , to whose interests it is professedly devoted .

		The eight vol - umes of which we have endeavored to give this outline contain over twenty-four hundred pages of reading matter , excluding prefaces , bibliographical matter , indexes , tables of contents , and maps .

		^ gj -RSB- about journalism in his `` Making a Newspaper '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- can hardly be worth the telling ; or at least the reader of his fuU and interesting and seemingly trustworthy account of all branches of his profession may well be left with that impression .

		In eighteen chapters , each packed with practical details , the story of the gi'eat American newspaper , as it now exists , is gi-aphically told .

		Noteworthy and unexpected is this experi - enced journalist 's admission , in his chapter on '' Preparing for Journalism , '' that '' the elements of newspaper work might be taught -LSB- in a school -RSB- as successfully as are the elements of law , medicine , or anything else , '' although as yet , he declares , '' there is in existence no well-equipped school which teaches journalism . ''

		Mr.
Given	PERSON	's tendency to regard '' yellow '' journalism rather as a huge joke than as anything more serious or deplorable , and as even not without its merits , is open to criti - cism .

		While the editors of these sensational sheets do not , as he admits , '' like everything about yellow journalism , ... their contention is that they go to extremes to attract readers , but that in doing this they gain wide followings , and are thus enabled to right wrongs , protect the weak , and strive with effect for the public good .

		That the yellow journals really do some of these things can not be denied . ''

		Mr.

		Opening with an account of his rise to the dignity and emoluments of a court stenographer , Mr.
Deming	PERSON	goes on to relate how he wrote his first successful story , then gfives a few tastes of his qualitj - as a narrator of fiction , and concludes with another bit of autobio - graphic reminiscence - His style , easy and conver - natinnal , is attractive ; and the plots of his tales , which have the touch of real life , are ingenious without being involved , and all end with a finely - conceived and unexpected stroke that pleasingly caps the already well-developed climax .

		His account of how he sent forth that first manuscript that stayed where it was sent will strike a responsive chord in many a breast .

		Even more subtly soul-stirring is his attempt to describe , from his own experience , the consecration and the poet 's dream .

		** The gentle breeie , '' he says , writing of himself in the third person , '' the soft gusurrug of the flowing stream , and the shining of the sun , became to him very beautiful , and he was suddenly conscious of a h ^ ipi - ness beyond these , and of which he could not speak and which he did not in the least know about or ■ understand .

		It was nothing ; it was formless as the viewless air .

		And yet it made his whole life broader and brighter ... And as time has gone by , at intervals of years this visitation has come again and again , and it has been the same sQent joy under all kinds of outward experience and circumstances . ''

		the stoiy of
King Arthur	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wherever there is any interest in romance , there is pretty sure to be a corresponding interest in
Arthur	PERSON	and his knights of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no group of stories in the middle ages that has exercised upon English literature a fascination comparable to this one , none that has combined so much of the poetic and the picturesque for the use of subsequent poets .

		It was therefore a particularly happy idea that prompted Dr.
Maynadier	PERSON	to present , in '' The
Arthur	PERSON	of the English Poets '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the story of
Arthur	PERSON	from the earliest times to Ten - nyson , and thereby to note the fluctuations of the romantic throughout our literature .

		Beginning with the historical
Arthur	PERSON	, of whose existence there does not seem to be much doubt , Dr.
Maynadier	PERSON	traces the growth and the various developments of the story in the middle ages .

		He shows how the several elements of the legend --
Merlin	PERSON	,
Lancelot	PERSON	, the holy grail , and Tristram -- came together and were given their finest mediaeval expression in a complete form in
Malory	LOCATION	's '' Morte D'
Arthur	PERSON	. ''

		Then follows
Spenser	PERSON	, the last of the medisevals and the first of the moderns , after whom there is comparative silence , especially during the unromantic stretches of the classical period , tiU the nineteenth century , when the early and the late romanticists found embodied in it all the enchantment of the middle ages , the strangeness added to beauty of which Pater speaks .

		It remained for
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	to give the story its most artistic expression .

		Dr.
Maynadier	PERSON	's treatment of his subject is most scholarly and sympathetic , and nowhere is it more so than in his discussion of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's presentation in modern form of this old - world legend .

		Interest in the history , geography , legends , and literatm-e of the
Emer	PERSON	- ald Isle has never been stronger than now , and it is increasing .

		No true son of
Erin	PERSON	will lightly put aside Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	's attractive and scholarly volume entitled '' The Fair HUls of

Saint Patrick	PERSON	extends his protection .

		The book , says Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	, '' has been written for the traveller rather than for the tourist , for Irishmen rather than for strangers ; but in general for all who will sympathise with the project which sent two of us out on a pilgrimage of pleasure undertaken in pursuit of knowledge .

		Our object was to represent by typical instances
Ireland	LOCATION	as a whole ; and so to a number of places and dis - tricts up and down the country we went looking for what would help to realise , for ourselves and for others ,

		Such practical topics as where and how to live , getting employment , avoid - ing loneliness , and finding suitable comradeship , are treated with eminent sanity and straightforwardness .

		Social and ethical questions are handled with a sure and accurate touch .

		The nature of the disease is discussed in the light of the latest research , and good advice is given as to things that are to be done as well as those to be avoided by the health - seeker .

		Anyone contemplating a

Alaska	LOCATION	.

		Day by day he kept a diary of the movements and adven - tures of the party , noting the smallest details .

		After the unsuccessful attempt had ended , and those con - cerned in it had returned to civilization , the idea of publishing the diary occurred to its author , and he determined to lay before the public an unvarnished tale .

		The author might advantageously have omitted some of the profanity and coarseness which he has retained , but apart from this blemish the book is a vivid account of exploring in the strange wilds of the remote
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reader may learn much about the natm-e of the country , and will be likely to imbibe the notion that he never will desire to explore that part of the world , especially if he has to go in the company of the particular men of whom he has read in this book .

		The Trail to the Woods , '' by Mr.
Clarence Hawkes	PERSON	, is published as an '' Eclectic Reading '' by the

Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Magdalen of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	are the subjects of two new volumes in '' The College Monographs '' series , published by

		Mr.
Thomas Street	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	, is the publisher .

		22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, '' Phrases and Names : Their Origins and Mean - ings '' is a title that explains itself .

		As far as it goes , the work is an excellent one , but it does not go nearly far enough , and the one who consults it will be rather more Ukely tlian not to fail to find the particular name or phrase wliich has excited his curiosity .

		Mr.

February	DATE	before the

		It is a plea for the wholesome simple life of an earlier period of our history , and is made with something more than the usual charm of style that we expect from its author .

		Copies may be had from Mr.
R. E. Lee	PERSON	, 212
Summer St.	ORGANIZATION	,

		A second edition of Mr.
R. C. Punnett	PERSON	's little book on `` Mendelism '' comes to us from the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the benefit of the layman , we may explain that
Mendelism	PERSON	is a theory of heredity propounded half a century ago by an Austrian biologist , a theory long ignored , but of recent years attracting considerable attention , and now made the starting-point of much fresh research along the lines marked out by this pioneer .

		Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	's occasional addresses are always interesting , besides being stimulating to all serious strivers after the good life .

		BRIEFER MENTION 4.5 NOTES 45 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 46 TITLES IN TRANSLATION .

		The fabled Frenchman who hit upon '' La Demiere Chemise de 1 ' Amour '' as a translation of '' Love 's Last Shift . ''

		has afforded the light - hearted much amusement .

		By way of turning the tables , the whimsical author of '' Alice-for - Short '' suggests • •
Miserj	PERSON	' Nosegay '' as a suit - able version of '' Bouc-emissaire , '' thereby making what is probably the worst international pun on record .

		But jesting aside , the problem of translating a foreign title is often a seriou.s one ; for between book and title there is always in the author 's mind something of a subtle harmony that is likely to be rudely jarred by the hand of the foreigner .

		What shall be done , for example , with such titles as '' Les Miserables , '' • '
Piccolo Mondo Antico	PERSON	, '' and • •
Det Flager	PERSON	i Byen og paa Havnen '' ?

		Well , we know what has been done .

		The first is reproduced in the original form as clearly untranslatable ; the second is frankly aban - doned with substitution of • • The Patriot , '' and the third is clumsily given as '' Flags Are Flying in
City	LOCATION	and Harbor , '' which misses the idiomatic force of ' • det flager . ''

		just as '' the rain is falling '' woidd miss the terse brevity of • • it rains . ''

		Happy is the translator who has only a proper name to deal with , for this he can reproduce with an easy conscience , although not without qualms as to the fashion in which his readers wUl pronounce it .

		We remeraljer
Balzac	LOCATION	's frantic search for the proper name he needed as a title for one of his stories , and his rap - turous delight when he at last discovered it --
Z. Marcas	PERSON	-- over a shop - window .

		But even as felicitous a name as that can hardly be expected to have for the English reader much of the significance that it had for its French discoverer . ''

		Jom LTil '' is exactly the name for Pastor Frenssen 's marvellous novel , but for the reader of the English translation almost any other German-sounding name woidd do equally well .

		And we doubt not that for a Russian ,
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, for a Spaniard ,
Maximina	LOCATION	, and for a Dane ,
Niels Lyhne	PERSON	, are respectively names that have esoteric associations not revealed to us , just as we are sure that no Frenchman or 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, German can share our own keen satisfaction in such names as
Martin Chuzzlewit	ORGANIZATION	and
Enoch Arden	PERSON	.

		Sometimes the title given to an English trans - lation is a wanton metamorphosis of the original ; at others it is simply perverse , made so through ignorance of the exact force of certain words .


Mary Howitt	PERSON	, who made the first English trans - lation from
Herr Bjbrnson	PERSON	, balked at the name '' ^ Synnove Solbakken , '' and called the book `` Trust and Trial . ''

		Conversely ,
Miinch	PERSON	- BeUinghausen 's '' Der
Sohn	PERSON	des Wilderness '' is known to us only by the name of
Ingomar	LOCATION	, its barbarian hero .

		These are illustrations of the former case ; of the latter , an example in point is provided by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's '' Et Dukkehjem . ''

		This title , which should be translated '' A Doll Home , '' has vmfortimately become perverted into the colorless phrase , '' The Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and custom has so fixed this form upon the English mind that it is now almost useless to protest against the mistranslation .

		The older and more classical works of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean literature have fared tolerably well in this matter of title-translation , mainly because their titles have offered no great difficulties .

		Dante ,
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Manzoni	PERSON	-- these have no cause to complain .

		Moliere 's '' Le Boiu-geois
Gentil	PERSON	- homme '' has made trouble , and it is , of course , one of those titles which can not be translated ; Goethe 's '' Wahlverwandtschaften '' might have made trouble , had not its translator hit upon '' Elective Affinities '' as a happy equivalent .

		The idiomatic title presents a serious problem , and lucky indeed is the translator who finds in his ovra language a corresponding idiom of similar brevity .

		Freytag 's '' Soil und Haben '' is a typical illustration of this case , for as `` Debit and Credit '' it retains in English its exact original meaning . ''

		Dame Care '' for
Herr Sudennann	PERSON	's `` Fi-au Sorge '' and `` Ground Arms ! ''

		for Fran von
Suttner	PERSON	's '' Die
Waff	ORGANIZATION	en Niederl '' also offer illustrations of felicitous idiom in translation .

		Another of
Herr Suder	PERSON	- mann 's books , grimly entitled '' Es War , '' ' con - fronts the translator with a delicate question .

		Does it mean , '' the past is over and done , '' or does it mean , '' we are responsible for the past and can not escape the consequences of oiu * deeds '' ?

		Our recent version of the book calls it '' The Undying Past , '' deciding for the latter interpretation ; but we are inclined to thmk that the former was the one the author meant to emphazise .

		The tendency of modern novelists and play - wrights to invent far-fetched or enigmatic titles makes the question of translation more compli - cated than it used to be .

		Particidarly in the case of a play the title has so large a share in determining its fortunes with the public that the selection of an alluring device becomes a matter of great consequence .

		Hence it is the rule rather than the exception that plays of foreign origin are served up to us with new English names . ''

		Les Pattes de Mouche '' becomes '' A Scrap of Paper , '' and '' Der
Raub	PERSON	der Sabinerinnen '' becomes '' A Night Off . ''

		Novels seem to have less need than plays of this sort of masqueratle , perhaps because they are purchased , for the most part , on the score of their authors ' reputation .

		A species of title peculiarly puzzling to the translator is that which is taken from some popular proverb , or consists of a literary tag .

		Biblical titles offer less difficulties than others of this kind , because they have familiar equivalents in most lan - guages , but such a title as '' Problematische Naturen '' requires , for all except Goetheans , a note to explain it .

		This practice of finding titles in familiai ' quotations is , however , far more common with English than with foreign writers , in consequence whereof the problem is more theirs than ours .

		Foreigners , in fact , pi-obably have greater troubles than we do in finding suitable names for translated books .

		Sometimes they make diffi - ciUties where such do not exist .

		Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	's '' The Jungle '' might have been published in French as '' Le Fouri-e , '' but its actual appear - ance was made as '' Les Empoisonneurs de
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		The difficulty goes all the way back to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the German text , we may easily enough recognize an old acquaintance in '' Ende Gut , Alles Gut , '' but we are apt to puzzle , for a moment at least , over '' Der AViderspJinstigen Zalimung . '

		And we take special delight in picturing to ourselves the foreigner racking his brain to convert into French or German such a title as
Browning	PERSON	's '' Red Cotton Nightcap Country ; or .

		Turf and Towers . ''

		He would have to go back to
Rabelais	LOCATION	, or Abraham a
Sancta Clara	LOCATION	, to find anything comparably fantastic in the book - nomenclature of his own literature .

		To cap the examples contained in this article with a final word of counsel , we wish to emphasize the obliga - tion resting upon every translator who modifies the title of his original , to print that original also upon his title-page .

		No translation has the right to masquerade in an impenetrable disguise .

		THE DIAI .

		29 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	at the cocbt of Kixg Edward -- not a Yankee in the strictest sense , but the term will serve -- has of late been attracting the general gaze .

		His appearance , too , at
Oxford	LOCATION	, in academic robe , to receive his doctorate , must have been a memorable spectacle .

		Even to the imagination of the absentee it is a rare treat to picture Mark Twain a '' thus solenmlv apostro - phized by Lord Curzon : '' Vir jocundissime , lepidissime , facetissime , qui totius orbis terrarum latera nativa tna hilaritate coneutis , ego , anctoritate mea et totius uni - versitatis , admitto te ad gradum doctoris in litteris honoris cajisa . ''

		But why , it may be asked , has staid old Oxford thus honored our great humorist ?

		Is it for his '' native hilarity , '' or for some deeper , more humanly appealing , more lasting quality ?

		Possibly the answer may be found in a few sentences , tremulous with feel - ing , that followed the fimny part of his address to the
Pilgrims ' Club	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		After holding a number of persons and things British up to good-natured laughter , the humorist suddenly turned grave and touched in a heart-stirring manner on the ties binding him to En - glaud , on the sadness that had entered his life in the death of a beloved daughter in mid-ocean seven years ago , and on the duty he felt to be his , knowing sorrow as he did by personal experience , to benefit humanity with all the cheerfulness of thought and speech at his command .

		It must be for his great heart , for his sym - pathy with the imder side -- which will be remembered as another great humorist 's definition of humor -- that
Mark Twain	PERSON	has been admitted to the '' grade of doctor in letters . ''

		... A TWICE-TOLD AUT0BI06RAPHT , as it appears , is that of Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, which began with great promise in the
June	DATE	''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine , '' was continued in the
July number	DATE	, and now is abruptly discontinued .

		The McClure editors chanced upon the disconcerting dis - covery that considerable portions of what they were publishing had already appeared , either in substance or verbatim , in '' The New Review '' sixteen years ago , under the title '' Stray Memories . ''

		This unfortunate plagiarism of oneself is charitably , and plausibly , charged to the amanuensis who prepared the manu - script for market ; and as no payment has yet been made for the `` dead wood , ' as the
McClure	PERSON	editors style it , there is not likely to be any impleasantness over the matter , unless Miss
Terry	PERSON	's agent , disap - pointed of his commission on a handsome purchase - price of the autobiography , should take legal action .

		On the whole , the discontinuance is to be regretted , since the probability is that the narrative would soon have worked itself free of stale matter and offered nothing but fresh and highly interesting reminiscences of the popular actress .

		The '' Xew Review '' chapters were short , confined to three numbers of that magazine , and gave very little of the narrator 's life after
1878	DATE	.

		For the twenty-nine subsequent years she must have much to relate that is well worth reading , to say nothing of the fact that even for the earlier years her discon - tinued memoirs were more detailed than those pub - lished in
1891	DATE	.

		A FTmNG
Longfellow	LOCATION	memorial takes the form of a fellowship in literature at
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, the poet 's alma mater .

		His three daughters ,
Miss Longfellow	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Dana	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Thorpe	PERSON	, have given ten thousand dollars to the college as an endowment , the income from which will be paid each year to some promising grad - uate for purposes of study abroad , or at some university at home , in languages and literature .

		Among the late commencement exercises at
Bowdoin	ORGANIZATION	was a
Longfellow	LOCATION	address by Professor
Henry Leland Chapman	PERSON	, who occupies the chair of English literature at that college .

		He spoke in the historic
First Congregational Church	ORGANIZATION	, where
Longfellow	PERSON	delivered his ' * Morituri Salutamus '' < m the fiftieth anniversary of his graduation .

		The speaker foimd the explanation of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's unique appeal '' partly in the essential nature of his art , '' and added that '' the truest art is that which reflects the simplicity of nature and lays upon the human spirit a spell not unlike that which is wrought in a thousand familiar ways by nature herself . ''

		He quoted aptly frran
Sidney	PERSON	's '' Apologie for Poetrie , '' which makes the poet monarch of all sciences . ''

		He cometh to you with words set in delightful proportion ; and with a tale forsooth he cometl ^ to yon ; with a tale which holdeth children from play , and old men from the chimney coiner ; and , pretending nothing more , doth intend the winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue . ''

		Not in
Brunswick	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, alone , but far beyond will satis - faction be felt at the honor filially paid to
Longfellow	LOCATION	, poet of '' old-fashioned poetry , but choicely good , '' as
Ixaak Walton	PERSON	might call him , were that amiable angler now alive .

		... Expecting the impossible of school-children is not good pedagogy , to say the least .

		The prescribing of literary exercises that would set even a well-fnmished adnlt head to aching is folly .


New York	LOCATION	boys and ^ Is , if < Mie may believe a
New York	LOCATION	journal not given to the printing of untruths , are required by their teachers to write essays and prepare debates on such topics as `` The influence of the
United States	LOCATION	on the World 's Diplomacy , '' `` Resolved , That any infringement upon the dual interpretation of the Constitution should be regarded as a menace to the stability of democratic institutions , '' '' Trade in the
East	LOCATION	during the
Fifteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' The Economic Development of the L'nited States from the Civil War to the Present Time . ''

		The public librarian is expected to smooth the path for the young feet so that the twelve-yeaiM -RRB- ld essayist and the fourteen-year-old debater shall acquit themselves creditably on the day of doom .

		But what can the best of librarians do except furnish such books as are least hopelessly beyond the comprehension of the youthful mind , and then wink at the wholesale copying of the little-understood contents ?

		It is all simply a lesson in plagiarism to those who are too young to know that plagiarism is wrong .

		Far wiser on the teacher 's part , and just as useful -LRB- or useless -RRB- to the pupil , would it be to prescribe a task in copying so and so many pages of
Adam Smith	PERSON	's `` Wealth of Nations '' or De Tocqueville 's '' Democracy in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The same end would at least be honestly reached , and by a less eiicuitoos course .

		... Introducing Shakespeare into
England	LOCATION	is what , if one may credit Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, has recently been effectively done by Mr.
Sothem	PERSON	and !

		Miss
Marlowe	PERSON	, '' the Englishman and the Englishwoman who have come to us from
America	LOCATION	, in the guise of Americans . ''

		How it is that our cousins across the ocean '' get from the acting and management of these two actors a result which no one in
Ijigland	LOCATION	has ever been able to get , '' is thus explained by Mr.
Symons	PERSON	: '' Well , in the first place ... they have the odd caprice of preferring Shakespeare to 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, themselves ; the odd conviction that fidelity to Shake - speare will give them the best chance of doing great things themselves ... There is no actor on our stage who can speak either English or verse as these two Americans can .

		It is on this preliminary technic , tliis power of using speech as one uses tlie notes of a musical instrument , that all possibility of great actmg depends . ''

		After praising Mr.
Sotheru	PERSON	's rendering of Hamlet 's soliloquy , the friendly critic continues : '' Every solilotjuy of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is meant to be overheard , and just so casually .

		To render this on the stage requires , first , an understanding of what poetry is ; next , a perfect capacity of producing by the soimd and intonation of the voice the exact meaning of those words and cadences .

		Who is there on our stage who has completely mastered those two first requirements of acting ?

		No one , now aeting in English , except
Julia Marlowe	PERSON	and
Edward Sothern	PERSON	. ''

		He further affirms , still referring to their acting : '' We have nothing like it in
England	LOCATION	, nothing on the same level , no such honesty and capacity of art , no such worthy residts . ''

		It is pleasant to note this hearty rec - ognition , but one could have wished tliat it had been more generally shared by the
London	LOCATION	public , and that Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	and
Miss Marlowe	PERSON	had met with greater pecuniary siiccess than appears to have attended their venture .

		A SKY-SCRAPING MONUMENT TO
THE PlLORIM Fathers	ORGANIZATION	will have its comer-stone laid next month by President
Roosevelt	PERSON	at the
Cape Cod	LOCATION	town of -- Ply - mouth , the uninformed would naturally conclude ; but it is not
Plymouth	LOCATION	.


Provincetown	LOCATION	, the fist at the end of the bent arm that defends the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	coast and presents hostile elbow and aggressive knuckles to the outside world , strenuously claims the honor of hav - ing first received on its shifting sands the imprint of a puritanic foot , at least twenty-four hours before the famous landing at
Plymouth	LOCATION	.

		How upsetting is all this to fondly cherished tradition !

		The '' holy gromid , the soil where first they trod '' now ceases to be that jeal - ously guarded bit of
Plymouth	LOCATION	granite on which so many sight-seers have gazed with swelling bosoms .

		The '' stem and rockbound coast , '' against which the breaking waves dashed high , must no longer call up a picture of the cranberry marshes around
Duxbury Bay	LOCATION	, but rather the gently sloping beach of
Barnstable County	LOCATION	.

		How liigh tliis interesting memorial at Prov - incetown is to rear its head can not here be exactly stated , but the confident hope of the '' Tip-Enders '' is that it will attain an altitude sufficiently lofty to look down on the humbled pride of
Plymouth	LOCATION	.

		At any rate , its erection is to start imder highly favorable auspices -- a speech from the most illustrious representative of the Dutch in
America	LOCATION	, and verses from a
New England	LOCATION	poet of more than
New England	LOCATION	repute .

		To anyone familiar with the narrow limits of
Provincetown	LOCATION	it will be a matter of doubt whether the little place will be able to contain itself on that proud day .

		• • • A MULTIFARIOUSLY USEFUL PUBLIC LIBRARY is that at
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, of which appreciative mention has already been made in these columns .

		Its Thirty-Sixth Annual Report , an elaborate , well-edited , well-printed publication of 123 pages , treats of a sur - prising number of interesting matters .

		This library 's activities are so numerous , without any foolish dissipa - tion of energy , that one may safely conceive of its head , Mr.
Samuel H. Ranck	PERSON	, as a decidedly wide-awake and efficient sort of pereon .

		Lectures , exhibitions , story liours for children , readings to the blind , '' sunsliine work '' for the benefit of the shut-in , personal talks to young people , the sending out of travelling libraries , -- these are some of the minor functions of a library that circulates more than 250,000 volumes a year among a population of about 96,000 , and maintains an increasing number of branches in various parts of the city .

		Pos - sibly an outsider might indulge in criticism , not so much of the library as of the board of health and the hospitals of
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	, for letting a literary institution bear the burden of an Anti-Tuberculosis Exliibition and coiu-se of lectures , as it generously did last year .

		A curious connection between literature and crime , or literature and the decrease of crime , comes to light in this Report .

		The fund aimually available for new books is mostly derived from police-court fines and county fines , of which the police-court contribution last year was eleven hundred dollars less than the year before .

		How much of this falling off , one queries , was due to the dissemination of wholesome reading-matter by the library ?

		Have we not here a novel kind of '' vicious circle '' ?

		The greater the usefulness of this admirable library , the more does it cripple itself for further usefulness , - and vice versa .

		• • • The Harvard class poem this year was of such merit as to attract attention .

		One
Boston	LOCATION	newspaper even pronounced it the best class poem ever delivered at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Its spirited call to engage high-heartedly in the battle of life had a swing and a fervor about it -- trite as was the theme -- that quickened the hearer 's pulse . ''

		On to the walls , and over ! ''

		rang the closing refrain , amid applause of manifest spontaneity .

		Perhaps it will not seem an odious comparison to Mr.
Hermann Hagedorn	PERSON	, the class poet , to say that his performance showed all the vigor , and something of the variety in facile command of metre , although not a spark of the playfid humor , of that most famous in the long list of Harvard class poems ,
Lowell	PERSON	's youthful -LRB- not to say boy - ish -RRB- assault on cant and humbug .

		As a spoken piece , it had the distinct superiority over
Lowell	LOCATION	's poem of brevity and simplicity , or unity .

		But that product of the nineteen-year-old poet 's pen was not spoken -LRB- whereby hangs a tale of woe -RRB- , nor indeed has it ever been pub - lished for general circulation . ''

		The baby arrows of that wit '' wherewith he '' dared assault the wouudless Truth '' were in mature manhood accounted as but feeble shafts by him whose hand had so jamitily sped them .

		Although young swans have a famous way of developing anserine traits in later life , one can not but cherish hopes of Mr.
Hagedorn	PERSON	's muse .

		May this lay of his not prove too literally -- or , rather , metaphorically -- the swan - song of his muse .

		... The knight of the comic libretto .

		Sir
William Schwenck Gilbert	PERSON	, will be begrudged his new honors by no one that has chuckled over his '' Bab Ballads , '' applauded the amusing conceits of ''
H. M. S. Pinafore	PERSON	, '' and laughed uncontrollably at the delicious absurdities of '' The Mikado . ''

		The function of humor in easing the stress of our strenuous life is receiving increased recognition .


Mark Twain	PERSON	has been made a doctor of letters by conservative old
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Gilbert	PERSON	has been knighted by his sovereign .

		No such honors were ever paid to those master humorists .

		Swift ,
Sterne	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		After the long years that hare feiiuiliarized ns with the be-lording of fat-pursed brewers and com - plaisant money-changers , it is refreshing to witness , now and then , a due tribute paid to letters , even letters of the lighter sort .

		The mission of mirtili , as well as the mission of money , is coming to be recognized in high quarters ... Ltteraby achievemkxt after forty is a theme of interest to the middle-aged .

		The masterpieces of men and women of eighty and over have already been briefly referred to in these columns .

		A much longer list of important works produced by writers of forty and fifty could easily be drawn up , as we are reminded by a paragraph now being quoted from an English jonrnaL
Scott	PERSON	had passed the forty line before he really fonnd himself and gave to the world the first of his '' Waver - leys . ''

		Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	was forty when she put the finishing touches to ''
Uncle Tom	ORGANIZATION	's Cabin . ''

		The best work of
Xewton	LOCATION	and
Darwin	PERSON	was done after they had counted two-soore birthdays ;
Swedenborg	PERSON	's '' illumination '' came in his fifties ; and '' Mother ''
Eddy	PERSON	, if we mistake not , had seen forty summers -LRB- besides autumns , winters , and springs -RRB- before she astonished the world with `` Seienee and Health , with Key to the Scriptures . ''

		The HorsE where the ^ Bad Boy '' lived -- Le .

		the late
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	's
Portsmouth	LOCATION	home -- is likely to be preserved as a memorial to the poet .

		At a public meeting of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	citizens , the mayor presiding , measures were adopted for the purchase and preservation of the building .

		Mrs.
Aldrich	PERSON	has generously offered to repaint and refurnish it in the closest possible conformity with its condition during her husband 's boyhood , and one room is to be especially set apart as a memorial of his later literary life and equipped with appropriate remind - ers of the man and the writer .

		And thus , though we have no feudal castles or monastic ruins , we are gradu - ally ac-quiring a storied atmosphere and enviromnent , with our
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	and Irving houses -LRB- to name only a few -RRB- , our projected monument to

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has been at work in the intervals of writmg half a dozen other books , tandem or abreast ; the intensity of his lordship 's application is only matter of conjecture .

		Presumably the editor of the letters of • * T. B. '' is findii ^ it a congenial task to edit those of '' V. R. '' They will , it is reported , cover the period from
1837	DATE	to
1861	DATE	, presenting a picture of the maiden queen , the young wife , and the woman sovereign learning to master affairs of state .

		The later letters , however , would prove more interesting to this generation of readers -- too interest - ing , perhaps , for present publication .

		* Tlie eventful life-story of a remarkably gifted , forceful , and in the highest sense courageous man is well and fidly told by General
James Harrison Wilson	PERSON	in his '' Life of
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	. ''

		Bom in
1819	DATE	, at
Hinsdale	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, of purest
New England	LOCATION	stock , which in turn was of genuine Old-England origin , on both father 's and mother 's side ,
Charles Anderson Dana	PERSON	was at nine years of age thrown on the world to battle for himself , and also , in part , for two younger brothers and a sister .

		If ever there was a self - made man , he was one .

		Humble toU , patient perseverance , thirst for knowledge and its eager and rapid acquisition in the face of obstacles , admission to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	self-taught and uncon - ditioned , and two years later a compulsory relinquishment of the unequal combat because of weakened eyesight -- all this , interestingly set forth by the biographer , leads up to the famous Brook Farm episode in young
Dana	PERSON	's life ; and that again opens the way to his acquaintance with
Greeley	PERSON	, his connection with '' The Tribime , '' his services to the government as special correspondent from
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's headquarters , his a-ssistant-secretaryship of war , and then his return to journalism , first in
Chicago	LOCATION	and finally in
New York	LOCATION	onee more , where his conduct of '' The Sun '' made him the most famous and the most widely read and quoted editor of his time , and insured him , when he died at his post ten years ago , a deathless renown as the bitter enemy of political corrup - tion , the ardent advocate of civil liberty , and the never-failing friend of reform and progress in every walk of life .

		A paragi-aph from the account of
Dana	PERSON	's experience of community life may serve as the first of our somewliat random excerpts from chapters that all contain quotable passages . ''

		Dana 's tastes and inclinations during his connection with Brook Farm , while primarily occupied in complet - ing his education according to his preconceived notions , naturally led him to write for such journals as would pay him for his contributions .

		As the Dial at first , and the Harbinger afterwards , were the official organs of the association , he by preference wrote much for them , but as he covered a multitude of subjects , it would be difficult to summarize what he said .

		While it was thoughtful , vigorous , and virile , it was like much which goes to make up the sum of our daily lives , of but little permanent value .

		It broadened and strength - • The Life of

		ened his mind , and cultivated his style , which steadily became more practical and direct and less fanciful and florid .

		The life of actual labor combined with his intel - lectual pursuits and strengthened liis body , improved his eyesight , and increased his confidence in himself , and this was of the first importance to him at least . ''

		The oft-told story of the causes leading up to our Civil War , its outbreak and , in part , its progress , with the subsequent problems of recon - ciliation and readjustment , is once more narrated at some length in connection with
Dana	PERSON	's work on '' The Tribune '' and later in government service .

		His summary dismissal , in
1852	DATE	, of the idea of violent eniancipation shows even his prophetic vision to have been sometimes blurred , his reading of the signs of the times to have been not always correct .

		The foUowing extract pre - sents a picture of him in
1863	DATE	as ostensibly a '' special commissioner of the War Department to investigate and report upon the condition of the pay service in the Western armies , '' but in reality a confidential agent sent out from
Washington	LOCATION	'' to report daily what he might see and learn . ''

		The author , a member of Grant 's staff at this time , writes from personal knowl - edge and observation . ''

		After the foregoing statement it will be understood that
Dana	PERSON	was received with every mark of respect and consideration .

		He was taken into one of the head - quarters ' messes on the footing of an officer of the highest rank -LSB- though his official rank was only that of major of volunteers -RSB- .

		His position was a difficult one , even with all we did to make it easy for him ; but as this narrative will show , he tilled it with tact , ability , and patriotism to the end .

		He was at all times not only modest and unobtrusive , but alert and ready to go where he might observe and learn for himself .

		In the full vigor of life , an excellent horseman and athlete entirely without timidity or fear , he was a Iielpful and encouraging influence upon all with whom he came in contact , and with no one more than with
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, who adopted towards him the most friendly and cordial manner and seemed to take special pleasure in his com - pany both in camp and on the march .

		In fact ,
Dana	PERSON	was in a certain sense a revelation to Grant as well as to those of us who were younger .

		He was not only genial , unaffected , and sympathetic in his manners , but far and away the best educated and most widely informed man that any of us had up to that time ever met .

		His companionship was therefore most acceptable and beneficial to all . ''

		The student of contemporary politics sees much to persuade him that this is preeminently an age of corruption -LRB- of '' graft , '' as the slang term lias it -RRB- in the public service , of investiga - tions and scandal-probing and muck-raking .

		But let him turn back a moment to the period of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's second term , to the days of the Whiskey Ring and the
Credit Mobilier	ORGANIZATION	, of the appointment to high office of the president 's fat-pursed benefactors , and their subsequent
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 33 forced retirement to inglorious privacy : then will it perhaps appear that , wicked as we are to-day , we have , at least in some respects , made progress toward a better state during the last third of a century .

		The following letter ends with a phrase that , forty years ago , went the roimds of the press and was repeated with mocking laughter by its countless readers .

		The letter was written by a
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	state treasurer to ``
Titian J. Coffey	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	,
Wash	LOCATION	- ington , D. C. '' It belongs to the early days of Grant 's first administration , an era of compara - tive virtue . ''

George O. Evaas	PERSON	.

		Put him through as you would me .

		He understands Addition , Division , and Silence . ''

		Concerning Dana the etlitor , one short para - graph sums up well his main characteristics . ''

		It is the testimony of those who had an opportunity to know , that no office of any kind was ever more quiet , happy , harmonious , and well-governed than was the Sun office imder
Dana	PERSON	.

		Every man in it fell unconsciously under the sway of his chiers personality , and from the first regarded himself as the respected and trusted ser - vant of a master whose eye for what was praiseworthy was never shut , and whose quick and generous impulse was to recognize and reward merit and ability wherever he found them .

		Xo newspaper at that time paid better salaries than the Sun and no better school of journalism ever existed in this coimtry .

		While the principal in - struction was given by the blue pencil , it was so thorough and so effective that those who were fortimate enough to receive it `` oon came to be known to the press at large as ' the clever young men of the Sun , ' and many of them now hold high and lucrative positions in jour - nalism . ''

		Among personal qualities and gifts for which the great editor was little known to the world in general were his unusual accomplishments as a linguist , his taste and zeal as a collector of Chinese porcelain , and his love and practice of arboriculture .

		His love of fi ndi n g interest for the mind in everything he did made the world a joy and a delight to him in all its parts .

Thk Structltkk of English Versk	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The average lover of poetry has for so long looked down upon versification as being merely dry bones , and has been so depressed by the difficulty of seeing any relation between some of the ndes and the verse that he likes best , that he may find it hard to believe in the existence of books on prosody which are really interesting and stimulating .

		Mr.
T. S. Omond	PERSON	's '' English Metrists in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries '' is one of the most important books on versification that have appeared since
Sidney •	PERSON	English Metbists in the

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
Lanier	PERSON	's `` Science of English Verse '' came out in
1880	DATE	.

		It is quite as noteworthy in one direc - tion as the fii-st volume of Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's '' History of English Prosody '' is in another .

		What Mr.
Omond	PERSON	undertakes to do , and what he actually accomplishes surpassingly well , is to give a brief summary of whatever in the past two hundred years various writers on English prosody have put forth in explanation of the structure of our verse .

		The number of theorists Mr.
Omond	PERSON	thus passes imder review will cer - tainly astonish all but the very few who know how extensive the bibliography of the subject is ; for even the more prominent of these theorists have been ignorant of the work of many of their predecessors , and have therefore often claimed a priority that belonged to others .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	has his own theory , as those know who have read his admirable '' Study of Metre '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	,
1903	DATE	-RRB- ; but in this latest vol - ume he shows a most exhilarating degree of fairness and discrimination .

		He has a keen eye for original thinking , and for attempts to get at the facts of our verse-structure ; and he does not allow any heap of rubbish in the sliape of iU-expressed or ill-applied theories to keep him from imcovering whatever is worthy of praise .

		At the outset , Mr.
Omond	PERSON	defines his terms , and re-states his theory of verse , which he first set forth in his '' Study of Metre . ''

		Quantity , he explains , refers '' solely to the time syllables take to pronovmce , '' and this depends '' either on vowel-duration or on retardation by sepa ^ rately pronounced consonants . ''

		As compared with the Greeks and Romans , `` we have a powerful stress-accent , which reduces quantitar tive distinction to low and fluctuating values ; they , apparently , had a very slight one . '' '

		Of accent , he says : `` Three elements must be distinguished in every spoken sound -- pitch , force , and duration .

		I purposely use the least ambiguous terms .

		Pitch is synonymous with height of tone , force with loudness ; dviration repre - sents what we have just called ' quantity . '

		These three elements are distinct and different , separable always in thought , separated often in practice .

		No analysis can be accurate which confuses them .

		In the books before us accent is defined sometimes as one of these -LRB- each in turn by different writers ! -RRB-

		, sometimes as any two of them , occasionally as all three together .

		At present it is usually defined as consisting of force .

		... I submit that , as a matter of fact , ` accent ' with us does not necessarily imply either elevation of pitch , or increase of loudness , or prolongation of time .

		Normally we like to unite all three on one syllable , and this is prob - ably our commonest type of accent '' -LRB- pp. 2-4 -RRB- .

		The writers Mr.
Omond	PERSON	deals with agree in one point . ''

		Unanimously they assert that accentuation plays in our verse the part that quantity did in Greek and Latin .

		Even this , surely , is but a half-truth .

		How can accen - tuation form a basis of metre ?

		It is an intensive , not an exteusive , factor .

		The phi - < ise ' accentual foot ' in - volves a misconception .

		The essential quality of a ` foot ' is duration , and this is not created by accent .

		Without doubt , accentuation is the most saUent feature of our verse , as ' quantity ' of Classic verse .

		But to presume identity between their fiuietions is illogical .

		The one records time , the other only illustrates it .

		With us , accent is mainly a signalizing element .

		It calls attention to periods , but does not and can not create these .

		So far as it makes the voice linger on a syllable , it becomes a constitutive element in verse ; but its main function is to emphasize the recurrence '' -LRB- pp. 5-6 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	believes , in short , that syllables do not make feet ; they either whoUy or in part fill up feet , and feet are merely temporal units .

		Of course , Mr.
Omond	PERSON	is opposed to syllable - counting , which practically ruled in the eight - eenth century and still persists as a most pes - tilent heresy ; he is opposed to every theory of verse which does not take into careful account the element of time .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	divides the two huudre < l years of his survey into four equal periods , to each of which he devotes a chapter .

		The first chapter , on '' The Old Orthodoxy , '' fills only sixteen pages ; for Edwai-d Bysshe ,
Gent.	LOCATION	, in his '' Art of Poetry , ''
1702	DATE	-LRB- with many later editions -RRB- , fairly represents not only what had preceded him , but what was to follow almost exclusively until after
1750	DATE	.

		To be sure , there was one small protest by
John Mason	PERSON	in his two '' Essays on the Power of Numbers , ''
1749	DATE	; but
Mason	PERSON	surpassed the rest only by recognizing some - thing of the clo.se analogy between verse and music .

		All our verse-criticism up to 1750 is based on authority , on dogmatic assertions as to what our verse ought to be , and not at all on analysis of what it actually is .

		The period between
1750	DATE	and
1800	DATE	, which Mr.
Omond	PERSON	calls that of '' Resistance and Re - bellion , '' started out like the first one , with a substitution of '' assertion for argument , and imagination for fact , '' in the Granunar prefixed to Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	's Dictionary .

		Of
Thomas Warton	PERSON	's '' History of English Poetry , '' the first volvmie of which appeared in
1774	DATE	, Mr.
Omond	PERSON	says : '' Students speak with respect of its siu ^ vey of our elder literatiu'e , and at the time it was thought wonder - ful .

		But to us the most astonishing fact about it is that it contains absolutely no discussion of verse-structure .

		This enidite and accomplished historian of our poetry never asks himself what is the actual nature of the verse he is describing ... Historically , his survey is admi - rable ; philosophically , it is naught .

		I do not think a more striking uistance could be fomid of how entirely
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 English scholarship had blinked the qneston of prosody , taking for granted a traditional view which applied Latin rules to English verse without ever enquiring whether as a matter of fact sueh application were pos - sible and justifiable '' -LRB- pp. 41-2 -RRB- .

		In
1775	DATE	, however , came the most remarkable book on prosody of the whole centurv --
Joshua Steele	PERSON	's • • Essay Towards Establishing the Melody and Measure of Speech , to be Expressed and Perpetuated by Peculiar Symbols , '' ' which in a second edition in
1779	DATE	was called • ' Pro- sodia Rationalis . ''

		Of
Steele	PERSON	.

		3 > Ir .

		Omond writes : `` For the first time -LRB- I believe -RRB- in the history of our literature , a writer proclaims that verse is essentially matter of musical rhythm , and applies musical methods frankly and fully to the aotation of metre '' -LRB- p 57 -RRB- .


Steele	PERSON	's great innovation was the recognition of rests or pauses .

		^ Ir .

		Omond 's comment on this is worth giving in full , because it gets at the very heart of the whole matter . '

		• This last idea was wholly new .

		The ' pauses ' spoken of by earlier writers were merely csesnral divisions , affecting the debvery rather than the substance of a line ;
Steele	PERSON	was first to treat tbem as Actors of metre .

		That this should be so is truly surprising , and shows the artificiality of previous prosody .

		For , surely , it is a adf-evident proposition that in any ordered succession of articulate or inarticulate sounds an interval of sflenoe may on occasion be substituted for utterance , and may count toward the total result ; just as in dancing a measured interval of quiescence may form part of the ' steps , ' or as in music ' rests ' are an integral part of the bar .

		Incredible as it may seem , this obvious fact had escaped notice , and was not admitted even after
Steele	PERSON	called attention to it .

		Succeeding metrists , except a few avowed followers of
Steele	PERSON	, ignored it in their teaching , as to this day it is ignored in the ' Pros - ody ' Section of our grammars .

		Coleridge never men - tions it in his references to metre .

		Poe does not notice it in his protest against scholastic scansion , not even when it would seem impossible to avoid doing so .

		As lately as
1870	DATE	, Professor Sylvester appears to claim it as his own peculiar discovery .

		During recent years not a few writers have , as they were well entitled to do , recognised its obvious reality .

		Yet when in my ' Study of Metre ' I took it more or less for granted -LRB- as I have done since the first day I began to think about verse - structure -RRB- , many of ray reviewers pronoonced this revolutionary .

		I should have deemed it a matter hardly needing demonstration that pauses as well as syllables go to make up a metrical unit '' -LRB- p. 58 -RRB- .

		In the third chapter , on '' The New Verse , '' ' the poets themselves b ^ in to be prominent ;
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		Southey .

		and
Poe	PERSON	are matched in importance only by
Guest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chapter b ^ ; ins with a discussion of precisely what
Coleridge	PERSON	meant by his principle of ' * counting in each line the accents , not the syllables . ''

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's explanation is that • '
Coleridge	PERSON	's practice , if not his definition , restored time to its true pre - eminence .

		He does not say that his accents occur at equal intervals , bat oar ears tell as that they do .

		The • feet '' are uniform in length , though diverse in the niunber of syllables they oontain '' -LRB- p. 89 -RRB- .

		In `` The North American Review '' for Sep - tember .

		1819 , appeared the first American con - tribution to English prosody --
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	's article on '' Trisyllabic Feet in Iambic Measures . ''

		Southey 's importance to prosody consists in his having started a tremendous con - troversy by publishing , in
1821	DATE	, his '' Vision of Judgment '' in ' • English hexameters . ''

		Guest 's '' History of English Rhythms . '' '

		1838 , owed its importance in the first place to the fact that it has been until very recently our most exhaustive treatise in English , and in the second place to the fact that ^ with its seriously mistaken notions , it has for two generations been accepted as authoritative .

		The period closed in
1848	DATE	with Poes • • Rationale of English Verse , '' which -RSB- SIr .

		Omond calls `` incomparably the most impor - tant contribution to prosodic study at this time '' -LRB- p. 138 -RRB- .

		In the chapter on '' The New Prosody ,
1850	DATE	-
1900	DATE	, '' Mr.
Omond	PERSON	singles out for special praise
A. J. Ellis	PERSON	,
Coventiy	LOCATION	-
Patmore	PERSON	.

		J. B. ilayor .

		Professor
Gummere	PERSON	,
A. H. Tolman	PERSON	; and above all these , and fairly rivalling
Joshua Steele	PERSON	in epochal importance , he puts
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	.

		Walt ^ Tiitman he considers very important as raising in acute form the question whether metre is essential to poetry . ''

		Whether irregular rhythms such as those favoured by
Whitman	PERSON	will ultimately oust the more regular , -- whether , to go no fitrtber , recondite harmonies of prose , often nobly illustrated by Whitman , will finally supersede the more definite tliytluns of verse , -- these are qnestions which no eritie can answer '' -LRB- p. 148 -RRB- .

		If we omit even men of deserved prominence and importance , and pick out -LRB- mly those who according to ilr .

		Omond have made the greatest contribution to a satisfactory theory of English metres , we find that these men are
Joshua Steele	PERSON	-LRB- 1775 -RRB- ,
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	-LRB- 1848 -RRB- ,
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	-LRB- 1859 -RRB- , and
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	-LRB- 1880 -RRB- .

		It is pleasant to find that three of these men are poets of repute , but rather surprising to find that these three have written within the last sixty years .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	values highly another 's '' deter - mination '' in defending a theory , and he is singularly candid and open-minded .

		At the end , although he has throughout criticised from the point of view of his own theory , he declares : `` Here is a cardinal point on which contzadiefaKy opinions still prevail .

		At the end of the 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16 , century	DATE	, people are still asking whether a bar of verse may -- or , at least , for several centuries did -- contain now two and now three syllables .

		We may think that the question answers itself ; but such is not the belief of all experts .

		The very fomidations of English prosody are still in doubt .

		Its ' essential prmciple ' can not be said to liave been placed beyond question '' -LRB- p. 225 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	had intended to close his survey with
1900	DATE	, but the contributions since that date have been so many -LRB- he enumerates more than twenty-five in his confessedly imperfect list -RRB- and so interesting that he added a Postscript of seventeen pages .

		Misprints are noticeably few , and the refer - ences are admirably exact and painstaking .

		At the end of the volume are two Appendices of atlditions and corrections , one to Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's previously published list of English quantitative verse , the other to his old list of works dealing with English verse-structure by native writers .

		It is a matter of regret that Mr.
Omond	PERSON	did not incorporate these appendices in revised lists which he might either have bound in with this volume or issued separately .

		It is earnestly to be hoped that he may still see his way to giving us these revised lists , which are exceptionally complete and acciu-ate .

		* The greater accessibility in recent years of the rich stores of historical documents in private possession in

		Without the aid afforded by these ancient records , a work so thorough and comprehensive as Mr.

		The records have , as he teUs us in his preface , been '' fi-eely used , '' the residt being '' the discovery of manufactories never chronicled m books on Tapestry , fuller informal tion about those already known , and much fresh material relating to Tapestries in general . ''

		lead up to the main subject -- the elaborate hangings that fi-om a very early period down to modern times were such an important feature in the furnishing of churches , palaces , and the dwellings of all who could afford such costly luxury .

		The sketch of tapestry weaving in
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	, in ancient times , is most interesting , and is properly marketl by restrained and cautious statement .

		Still , the avoidance of definite expression occasionally suggests unwarrantable inference , as in the ca.se of the famous hangings from
Babylon	LOCATION	, mentioned by
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	, afterward bought by
Nero	ORGANIZATION	for a sum estimated as equal to about # 80,000 of our money .

		They may have been tapestries ; but it woidd not have been out of place to men - tion the uncertainty as to their precise nature .

		The term tajjestry , it is perhaps well to explain , is a technical plu-ase designating a particular weave in which , to quote Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's defi - nation , '' the weft or horizontal threatl is pressed down so as to envelop completely and conceal the warp or vertical threads . ''

		It is a curious fact that one of the most ancient textile fabrics in existence , a piece of white linen from the tomb of Thoutmosis IV. , about
1449	DATE	B. c , is tapestry woven .

		The Egyptian weavers in the course of many centuries deyelojjed extraordinary skUl .

		Bits of tapestry now extant that were woven by them for dress material evoke Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's imrestrained enthusiasm . ''

		Perfect in colour , gossamer-like in its sUken and Unen textiu-e of exquisite fineness , need we wonder that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries specimens of it brought westwards were attributed to the powers of enchanters and fairies ? ''

		In
Western Europe	LOCATION	, during the early ages and up to the fourteenth century , the weaving of tapestry was almost universal in the monas - teries , but the total output was probably not very large .

		With the crusades came a taste for luxurious appointments , stimidated by the magnificence of the carpets and hangings of the
East	LOCATION	.

		Gradually centres of secidar manufacture of tapestry grew up , and by the beginning of the fifteenth centuiy the industry liad become one of gi'eat importance .

		It is not easy for us to realize the part that tapestry played in the life of people of that period .

		In the mansions of the great it was the chief furnishing .

		For festive occasions , pageants , and elaborate cere - monials , it was indispensable .

		Of the entrance into
London	LOCATION	of
Elizabeth , Queen of Henry VII.	ORGANIZATION	, we read that '' Al the strets ther , whiche she shulde passe bye wer clenly dressed and besene with cloth of Tappestrye and
Arras	LOCATION	; and some
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 37 streetes an Chepe , hanged with riche clothes of golde , velvettes and silkes . ''

		The most highly esteemed of these sumptuous hangings were the products of the looms of the Flemish town of
Arras	LOCATION	, which during
the first half of the fifteenth century	DATE	was the principal centre of tapestry weaving .

		Under the liberal | jatronage of Philip the Good , Diike of Bur - gundy , the tapestries of
Arras	LOCATION	became world - famous .

		Not only were the weavers most skilful , but no pains were spared to secure designs from the most competent hands .

		With the accession of Charles the Bold , the fortunes of the town began to decline : and when , in
1477	DATE	, it was captured by
King Louis XI.	LOCATION	, its fate was sealed .

		The taxes and restrictions laid upon the weavers were so onerous that within two years nearly all of them had emigrated .

		Though in
1484	DATE	Kins
Charles VIII	PERSON	.

		strove to rcAave the indus - try , his efforts met with no success .

		Its great centre had been destroyed as effectually as the earlier centre of tapestry wea ^ - ing in
Paris	LOCATION	had been destroyed by the English occupation under
Henry V	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tapestries woven in
Toumai	LOCATION	in the fif - teenth century were scarcely less celebrated than those of
Arras	LOCATION	, and there were many excellent weavers in other towns in
Flanders	LOCATION	and else - where in
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		The artistic quality of their products suffered no marked deteriora - tion imtU Pope
Leo X.	PERSON	, in
1515	DATE	, commissioned
Raphael Sanzio	PERSON	to design a set of ten cartoons of the Acts of the Apostles , which were sent to
Brussels	LOCATION	to be woven .

		Very properly .

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	lays stress upon the malign influence these famous cartoons were destined to exercise .

		As he points out , '' With the execution of the cartoons of
Raphael	PERSON	, one of the most rapid changes of style in any art took place in
Brussels	LOCATION	.

		Dramatic and pictorially decorative com - positions took the place of the old crowded and formal arrangements .

		Tapestry , without imitating the tech - nique of painting , became as it were a woven picture or fresco in aught else .

		The excessive richness due to wealtli of detail in natural objects such as flowers was discontinued , and with it went the loving treatment of things inanimate .

		Richness of effect was attempted more by the iLse of broad spaces worked in gold and silver than by elaborate pattern . ''

		Dazzled by the reputation of the foremost artist of his day , men faile < l to perceive the unsuitability of his designs for the purpose of reproduction as tapestry .

		If the weavers , to whom they presentetl strange problems , recog - nizetl this truth , their taste was overborne by commercial considerations .

		Even the old de - sigms had erred through too much realism .

		In general it may be said that superb as were ' many of the hangings made from them , lovely in texture and in color , their artistic value was seldom of a high order .

		The verj ' nature of tapestry calls for conventional design , or in other words for design carefully adapted to the process of weaving and the effects proper to it .

		j The old verdures and archaic renderings of ' figures and architectural details were right in principle .

		And in modem times the beautifid hangings woven at
Merton Abbey	ORGANIZATION	from the designs of
William Morris	PERSON	and Sir
Edwin Bume	PERSON	- Jones conform to every canon of good taste .

		As for the pictorial tapestries of the sixteenth century and later , while they are remarkable as i tours de force of weaving , they have small merit as works of art .

		And for the most part , time , by destroying their charm of color , has left little that can justly claim our a ^ lmiration .

		This phase of the subject Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	avoids , though a stray word here and there indicates that his ideas upon it are sound .

		He writes as a historian , not as a critic .

		Some of the tales he tells , as , for example , that of the ^ - icissitudes of the hangings of `` The Apocalypse '' in the cathedral of Angers , are stranger than fiction .

		And occasionally there is a peep into general historj ' , as the reference to the dis - patching by
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, who was a most enthusiastic tapestry collector , of agents to Ant - werp on the pretext of buying hangings , but in realitj - to acquire political intelligence .

		Lists of roj ^ al collections , names of weavers , and a wealth of miscellaneous data of various kinds , are scattered through the book .

		The history of tapestry manufacture in
England	LOCATION	is told for the first time , in especial an ample account being given of the factory established at
Mortlake	LOCATION	in the
seventeenth century	DATE	.

		At the end of the volume is a valuable chapter devoted to weavers ' marks .

		In it are represented aU that are known to have been used by the tapissiers since the r ^ ulation promidgated at
Brussels	LOCATION	in
1528	DATE	, making it obligatory that everj - piece of more than six ells woven in the town should be , marked .

		The illustrations are nimierous and well selected .

		Many of them , notably the reproductions in color of the famous '' Hunting Tapestries '' at
Hardwicke Hall	PERSON	, accounted the finest fifteenth century hangings preserved in
England	LOCATION	, are from drawings by the author .

		Altogether the book is a most satisfactory one .

		It is not only a treasury of information , but .

		so cleverly have the innumerable details been j woven into the narrative that it is readable as well as interesting .

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, The Mistress of the Adihatic * The great cities of
Italy	LOCATION	--
Rome	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Milan	LOCATION	, and the rest -- have long been objects of profound interest , not only to the traveller but to the student as well , especially to the student of histoiy .

		It is probable that this interest will long continue , though at times the student 's attention will doubtless be at - tracted more strongly toward one city tlian another .

		If we may judge from the number of recent works dealing with the history of
Venice	LOCATION	, we shall have to conclude that at present the chief interest centres about the wonderful city on the
Adriatic	LOCATION	.

		Among those who have made a serious study of the Venetian past , perhaps none is more eminent than the Italian historian
Pompeo Molmenti	PERSON	.

		By birth a Venetian , he is naturally attracted to the history of his native state , a history '' fidl of varied episodes , some felicitous , some disasti'ous , almost all glorious . ''

		But the story of the Doges has been told so often by winters of eminence that on the narrative side of the subject little that is new can be found to teU .

		Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	, however , as an art critic and a teacher of literature , is naturally inter - ested in other matters than what we usually call '' events '' ; he is drawn toward the more intel - lectual phases of his country 's development -- its laws , culture , and mode of life .

		Twenty-seven years ago he published his first important work , a study of Venetian history '' as revealed in the private life of the people . ''

		But this was merely an introductory essay .

		Since its publication the author has continued his researches , collected more materials , and developed newer views ; these are to be published in a large work of six volumes in which is traced the individual growth of the city '' from the earliest beginnings to the fall of the republic . ''

		The volumes are divided topically into three sections -LRB- two vokunes each -RRB- , the first section dealing with mediaeval
Venice	LOCATION	, the second with the golden age of the city , and the third with the years of its decadence .

		Sinndtaneously with the Italian publication an English translation is appearing , the work of Mr.
Horatio F. Brown	PERSON	, British archivist in
Venice	LOCATION	, widely known as an authority on Venetian sub - jects .

		The first section comprises two attractive volumes of about five himdred pages , provided with a large number of excellent illusti-ations , mainly copies of contemporary illuminations •

		Of the translator 's work , so far as it has been com - pleted , the reviewer 's criticism must be favor - able tliroughout ; stiU , it is unfortunate that so many passages have been left mitranslated .

		The reader who knows Italian will no doubt de - light in the numerous citations of Italian verse , but the general reader also is entitled to some consideration , and it is unfortunate that so much Latin and Romance should be insertetl in an English edition without even an English para - phrase in a foot-note .

		What impresses the reader first of all is the absence of narrative , as that term is commonly applied .

		Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	's history is de - scriptive ; it deals with institutions and customs , with social castes and classes , with the material interests of the entire popidation , not with the achievements of individual leaders and states - men .

		Names of prominent Venetians are indeed mentioned , and their work is to some extent dis - cussed , especially in the chapters on Fine Arts and Culture ; but , as a ride , personages are brought into history merely to determine the chronology .

		The history is a series of essays each of which carries its particidar theme down to the close of the middle ages .

		An introduc - tory chapter discusses the origins of the city and of the early settlements .

		Other topics are the appearance of the city , its houses and public buildings , its constitution and laws , its systems of conmierce , its finance and economy , the vari - ous classes of its population , popular festivals , martial exercises , and amusements .

		The second volume is devoted to the more intellectual phases of Venetian civilization -- manners , customs , the industrial arts , the fine arts , and cidture .

		At the close of this volmne the author lias added a number of mediaeval documents which the his - torical student will find exceedingly useful .

		We usually thmk of
Venice	LOCATION	as a product of the troublous times in the
fifth century	DATE	when Huns and Germans were terrorizing the civilized south .

		Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	does not dispute the venerable story that the city originated as a refuge from the wrath of
Attila	LOCATION	; but he holds that the islands -- or some of them at least -- in the upper
Adriatic	LOCATION	had been inhabited for centuries , and that the movement referred to must not be given too much credit .

		He thor - oughly discredits the story that
Venice	LOCATION	was born free and always remained independent , as early Venetians have taught . ''

		Such complete inde - pendence was not in the spirit of the age , and no Latin race would ever have dreamed of refusing

		The author dates the beginning of '' the glorious history of
Venice	LOCATION	'' from 814 , when the Doge removed the seat of government to
Rialto	LOCATION	.

		That a large part of the work should be de - voted to commerce , finance , and related subjects , is to be expected ; but so great were the achieve - ments of the city in these regards that the author has had to content himself with giving compar - atively brief sunmiaries instead of detailed ac - counts .

		An interesting subject is that of explo - ration and colonization . '

		•
San !	LOCATION


Marco	PERSON	sent his children far afield in search of fortune ; and the constitution of the Republic , and even the very aspect of
Venice	LOCATION	herself , were reproduced in for - eign cities .

		Whole colonies of Venetians settled abroad and were protected bj - special laws and by their own consuls . ''

		When we remember the journeys of
Marco Polo	PERSON	into eastern
Asia	LOCATION	, and the explorations of the Zeno brothers in the
North Atlantic	LOCATION	, we realize the truth of the statement that the mediaeval Venetian did wander far afield .

		Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	gives full credence to the Zeno letters , and holds that
Niccolb Zeno	ORGANIZATION	actually '' touched the coasts of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		He also appears to believe that the Norse colonies in
America	LOCATION	, which were planted in the eleventh eenturj ' .

		were still existing when
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	visited this continent in the fourteenth cen - tury .

		It must be said , however , that while the audiors conclusions on this point are interesting .

		they do not seem to be founded on a sufficient study of all the available evidence .

		The second volvune does not record such re - markable achievements as the first ; in the middle ages the material culture of
Venice	LOCATION	was always far in ad \ - ance of the intellectual .

		Especially was the literature of the city wanting in poetry . ''

		The vast and silent spaces of the lagoon would seem to unlock the dirine fount of song , and yet the mnses were never held in high esteem in
Venice	LOCATION	, or perhaps it would be truer to say they were never worthily wooed , and never attained any great influence upon general cul - ture , even when refinement had reached a high standard .

		The genius of the Venetians was always more inclined to matters of trade , to political discussion , to severe studies , than to the graces of verse and song . ''

		The city possessed , as the author clearly demon - strates , a varied and \ Tgorous culture , but both in purpose and in character it was almost wholly utilitarian .

		But Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	also finiis much to say in defence of Venetian learning : it was , after all , in many respects of a higher character than that which flourished at the courts of the Italian despots .

		• • The state of
Venice	LOCATION	was strong enough in wealth and wisdom to dis - pense with the purchased praises of the erudite ;
Venice	LOCATION	, if she did call to her service the learned , did not do so to purchase facile compliments , but to instruct her youth destined to high public office , and to open schools for the teaching of grammar , rhetoric , and other useful sciences . ''

		To our author , any extraordinary developments in the realm of intellectual culture seem to mean the passing of youth , the failure of energy , and the call for rest , ease , and comfort . ''

		By the end of the fifteenth centurj - the mistress of the seas had reaped the harvest of her energy , of her activity , of her sacrifices : but her splendor , which had already touched its apogee , now began to pass into the region of culture and of art , and already held in itself the earliest germs of decay .

		The Poet of DisrLLUsiOJfMExr .

		* In a sur \ `` ey of the development of realism in literature ,
George Crabbe	PERSON	has a distinctive place among pioneer leaders of the movement in En - ^ and .

		He soimded a challenge in verse against the merely idyllic and romantic with as much force as did
Jane Austen	PERSON	and Fielding in fic - tion .

		He framed detailed contrasting pictures of country life and its yeomanry , to correct the idealized portrayals of similar scenes by Gray and
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		In his life and literary im - pulses ,
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	was limited in vision ; he lacked the love of beauty and the sympathy of
Cowper	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, yet he had keen observation , good skill in delineating certain kinds of char - acters , and an undaimted love of the truth .

		These qualities , while they brought him the title of '' the poet of disillusionment . ''

		yet gave to '' The Village , '' '' The Parish Register , ' '' and '' Tales in Verse '' some merits of real literary value .

		These general thoughts are recalled by the new biography , in translation , of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, written by
M. Rene Huchon	PERSON	and well rendered into English by Mr.
Frederick Clarke	PERSON	.

		As a basis of biographic facts , the standard life of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's son , published seventy years ago , is chosen ; while new material is incorporated and new interpretation of the poet 's work is freely offered .

		40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, son in many ways , notably in a love of science and a fondness for the sea .

		In '' The Village '' and '' The Borough , ''
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	photogi-aphed certain features of his early life at Aldborough , and of his visits to the sailors ' cabins , where he listened to their wierd tales and was fascinated by curious relics from foreign shores .

		He was a lad of dreamy , imaginative nature , keen in sensibility and in pride .

		At thirteen his school - days were ended , and he passed thi-ough vicis - situdes , lai ` gely painful and irritating , for seven years , as apprentice to apothecaries at
Wickham Brook	LOCATION	and
Woodbridge	PERSON	.

		These experiences , coupled with a keen study of men and women of unfortunate lives , awakened his satire against the rich and led to his psychological portrayal of outcasts and down-trodden men tod women in his mature poems .

		There was one compensating pleasure and influence for good during these vexing years of youth , namely , his friendship for
Sarah Elmy	PERSON	, the '' Mira '' of his poems , who became his wife after many years of patient waiting for him to win recognition and income .

		During the sea - sons of discouragement and promise alike , he kept alive his mental interests , studying botany and geology as well as medicine , and writing poetry spasmodically .

		After a futile effort to enlist the patronage of
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	, he finally gained the interest of
Burke	PERSON	, to whom he sent the prospectus of his poem on '' The Library . ''

		From this encouragement dates the success of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's literary work .


Burke	PERSON	was a true friend to
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	for many years ; he paid his debts , made him his com - panion , urged him to study for the church , and finally secured for him a place as curate at
Aldborough	LOCATION	, in
1781	DATE	.

		The villagers , however , were inclined to sneer at the new curate whom they had known as work-boy and apprentice , and
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	was glad to secure a place as do - mestic chaplain to the Duke of
Rutland	LOCATION	, while he took revenge on his feUow-townsmen by many lines of satire in '' The Village . ''

		Through the opportimities offered at the palace of his noble patron , he met
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, and other men of note .

		To Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	he submitted the manuscript of '' The Village '' for revision , and the honored critic of the day pronoimced the poem to be '' original , vigorous , and elegant . ''

		This panoi-ama in verse , like nearly all of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's work , lacked unity , and was too purposeful to be artistic .

		One of the best examples of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's mode of procedure against the conventional treatment of the beauties of the country is found in this poem . ''

		Fled are those times , when iii harmonious strains , The rustic poet praised his native plains : Rank weeds , that every art and care defy , Reign o'er the land , and rob tlie blighted rye ; There thistles stretch their prickly anns afar , And to the ragged infant threaten war ; There poppies , nodding , mock the hope of toil ; There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil ;
Hardy	PERSON	and high , above the slender sheaf , The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf ; O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade , And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade ; With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound .

		And a sad splendor vainly shines around . ''

		`` The Newspaper '' was a return to more impersonal and artificial themes , as in '' The Library '' ; but these discursive satires and dis - sertations in rhyme are forgotten , while '' The Village , '' `` The Borough , '' and `` The Parish Register '' are still significant .

		Domestic trials came rapidly to
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, culminating in the illness of his wife and the loss of her mental balance during the remainder of a long life .

		She remained , however , the chief care and ob - ject of her husband 's affection ; he never wearied in seeking comforts for her and gratifying her childish whims .

		In '' The Borough '' and '' The Parish Register '' he found saving relief from these home-trials and the routine of a coimtry curate 's life .

		Looking over an imagi - nary page of a parish register , divided into three parts -- births , marriages , and deaths -- the poet introduced varied types , aristocracy , clergy , shopkeepers , laborers , and gave in the completed form of the poem a vivid realistic picture of English rural life at the
end of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		By grouping such isolated characters and scenes as he had chosen to portray in his earlier poems , and weaving a romantic thread of action , he reached a natural sequence in '' The Tales in Verse , '' '' Tales of the HaU , '' and '' Posthumous Tales . ''

		While his characters in these later '' Tales '' are no more vigorously drawn than some of those in '' The Village '' and '' The Borough '' -- like
Fanny Price	ORGANIZATION	, Widow Goe ,
Isaac Ashford	PERSON	'' the noble peasant , '' pretty
Phoebe Dawson	PERSON	, and
Peter Grimes	PERSON	the fisher - man , -- yet the men and women act and react upon each other through distinct motives , as is well outlined by
M. Huchon	PERSON	.

		Nearly all of the '' Tales '' are pathetic , sometimes tragic ; yet a few have less '' pathos of disenchantment '' and more optimism of outlook , as '' The Confidant '' and the idyll of ''
Jesse	PERSON	and
Colin	PERSON	. ''

		The last lines of this latter poem summarize
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy of happiness , the quiet joy of simple domestic life .

		The happiest years of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's life , in the opinion of this biographer , were passed at
Trowbridge	ORGANIZATION	from 1813-1818 , the place asso - ciated in our memories with
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	and the

		1861-65 '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author was much dissatisfied , he says , with the way in which
Kentucky	LOCATION	historians have written about the Civil War period , and so has undertaken to correct some of their mistakes .

		Professor
Shaler	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, who wrote the volume on
Kentucky	LOCATION	in the '' American Commonwealths '' series , receives rough treatment at the hands of Captain Speed .


Shaler	PERSON	was also a
Union	ORGANIZATION	soldier from
Kentucky	LOCATION	, but Speed asserts that he was entirely too favorable to the Confederates of that state .

		The book under review is mainly an attempt to disprove certain propositions of Professor
Shaler	PERSON	, which may be summarized as follows : The Kentucky Confederates were from the wealthier families of the fertile Blue Grass section , while the Unionists were poorer people from thinner soik ; the Confederates were younger men and made better soldiers than the Unionists : the
s %	PERCENT	- mpathies of
Ken	PERSON	- tucky were really with the .

		South , but she was held in the
Union	LOCATION	vi et armis ; during the war the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral provost marshals were guiltj - of the grossest outrages against Southern sympathizers .

		To prove that these conclusions are wrong is the task that I Captain Speed undertakes .

		The attempt is not I altogether successful The work has those faults to which the author objects so strongly in the other state historians .

		It is a frankly partisan account of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	side , just as some of the others are biassed accounts in favor of the Confederates .

		The method employed is interesting , but unfortunately not convincing .

		The author qaotes objectionable passages from
Shaler	PERSON	and others , and then proceeds to demolish them with statements of his own views or with quotations of opinion from others with whom \ he agrees .

		The result is that much of the work consists merely of denials of the conclusions of other writers .

		There is little of the historical temper mani - fested : the account of Professor
Shaler	PERSON	is far more temperate and philosophical .

		But aside from these & uilts , which are serious , there is much that is useful in the work .

		The author g ^ ves a good account of how the Unionists organized their forces , in
1861	DATE	, to hold
Kentucky	LOCATION	in the
Union	LOCATION	.

		This part of the book coold not have Ijeen better done .

		Of consid - erable value and interest also are the lists given of Unionist leaders , election statistics , and enlistment statistics .

		Other informing chapters are those on the location of
Union	LOCATION	sentiment , the fighting within the state , the guerrillas , and
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's raids .

		In spite of Captain Speed 's controversial method , which canses him often to neglect facts for arguments and opinions , the work will be found useful for it is the best available source of information about the
Union	ORGANIZATION	eanse in
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

Lipsius	PERSON	is thus spoken of in the Introduction : `` Whatever defects of matter or style our writer may have had , like all the humanists he served a great purpose in retailing to further generations -- and especially to librarians -- the opinions of the classic writers on the history of libraries , '' Were there then no humanists uninterested in library history , or silent on the subject ?

		Lipsius was a prodigious bookworm , but the results of his burrowings must sometimes be taken wnth a grain of salt -- as his statement that in the Byzantine Library '' was the gut of a great dragon , one hundred and twent -RCB- - feet long , on which was written in letters of gold the 4 ^ THE DIAL -LSB-

		Both tracts are very short , and chiefly noteworthy as furnishing touching evidences of poor

Frederick A. Ober	PERSON	, the well-known student of Spanish-Amer - ican history , who has made personal researches for the government with a view to a clearer knowledge of our earlier annals .

		The romance of discovery and adventure clinging to six great names has been admirably set forth by Mr.
Ober	PERSON	in the volumes dealing with

Italy	LOCATION	during the Last Two Centuries '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is practically a monograph , a bibliography of travel-literature as regards the famous peninsula for the period named .

		A reflecting student is always surprised that out of the wreck of war and time anything of ancient
Italy	LOCATION	remains ; and a new surprise may await the reader of this book when he learns the very tardy recognition of what is left us .

		It seems that the appreciation of
Italy	LOCATION	, as of much else of value in the world , awaited the revival of learning and the Reformation .

		In fact , hardly by the middle of the eighteenth century had educated people any real conception of the culture-value of what every Roman town and city could still show .


Italy	LOCATION	was discovered as literally and quite as slowly as
America	LOCATION	; not that visitors were lacking , but that those who did see
Italy	LOCATION	saw so very little .

		Even the most appreciative foimd only one thing at a time : thus , the celebrated Winckelman saw in
Rome	LOCATION	only a depository of the art of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, and it remained for Diderot and the men of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion to appreciate Angelo and
Rafael	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present volume is intended , further , as a contribution to a more exact appreciation of Goethe ; and while not a commentary on the
Italienische Seise	PERSON	, it is yet designed to supply needed perspective to the student who would understand that piece of German litera - tm-e .

		Goethe was in
Rome	LOCATION	in
1786	DATE	, and was a traveller in various parts of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	for many months .

		The impress of this experience appears in all the subsequent work of the poet , but the formal record of the journey to
Italy	LOCATION	did not appear until
1816	DATE	.

		It would seem that
Goethe	PERSON	destroyed most of his original notes , and yet , judg - ing from those that remain , first published in
1886	DATE	, the '' taffebiicher '' had doubtless interested men to-day much more even than the finished and studied volume which is designed to take their place .

		But Professor
Von Klenze	PERSON	does not intend to tell us what Goethe saw or reported so much as to give an idea of the intellectual conditions , the tuition under which he worked .

spring	DATE	at the
University	ORGANIZATION	- of

University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	,
1899	DATE	, on `` Education of Public Opinion '' ; and , third , '' Democracy and Education , '' ' delivered at the convention of the Na - tional
Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1896	DATE	.

		In all three , stress is laid on the importance of enlightened liberty under a democratic form of government , and its antagonism to that deadJevel equality that was the impossible ideal of the French revolutionists , and that would be fatal to all progress , all happi - ness , and , in short , to all government .

		The author declares himself emphatically in favor of the present system of political parties , subject to abuse though that system is : and , as a necessary consequence , he holds the independent voter in rather slight esteem .

		In harmonj ' , too .

		with his general political leanings is his conviction that it is not our chief executive who is usurping legislative functions , but quite the opposite .

		Certain legislative abuses he censures littingly .

		especially the unwieldiness , obstructive - ness , and openness to corruption , that characterize our overgrown law-making bodies : • ' for it is well - nigh a political axiom that large constituencies make independent representatives , and that small con - stituencies make tools and ciphers .

		We must not forget how much farther a bullet will carry than a few score of small shot . ''

		Worthy of passing notice , perhaps , as a typographical curiosity are the author 's references to Gladstone the leader -LRB- with a small I -RRB- and to Mr.
Croker	PERSON	the Boss -LRB- with a large B -RRB- -- an unintentional reversal of dignities .

		In this De Vries would controvert the Darwinian view that species result from very slow and gradual minute changes responsive to changing environment .

		For the sup - jx > rt of his theory ,
Darwin	PERSON	made constant appeal to the experience of breeders , especially of cattle and birds ; although as a botanist he himself made a great many very interesting experiments in breed - ing jdants .

		De V ^ ries .

		in support of his contention , cites not only his own experience , but is able to bring into the field the results offered by experiment stations and investigators who have worked since
Darwin	PERSON	, in all parts of the world .

		The book is , accordingly , a summary of what has been achieved by such men as
Nilsson	PERSON	in
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Burbank	LOCATION	in
California	LOCATION	, and others , especially as the results obtained by these men bear upon the que ^ on of species derivation .

		De Vries , of course , finds in aU the more recent results obtained by gardeners and experimenters confirmation of his own theory , always assuming that selection in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	operates essentially in the same manner as when plants are 44 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The volume is clearly and pleasantly written , and as the forms of plant-life discussed are thoije in which there is much general interest , -- such as wheat , oats , corn , and various fruits , -- it may be read with satisfaction and profit by all .

		,
^ Literary Papers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we have the record of a simple but strenuously active life .

		Born in
1857	DATE	and dying in
1904	DATE	, Mrs.
Michael	PERSON	has left us records of investigation not only surprising in bulk , but , as Dr.
Wiley	PERSON	, the govern - ment chemist , says , `` prominent in the annals of American chemistry . ''

		For Mrs.
Micliael	PERSON	was a chemist , and long before her marriage
Helen Abbott	PERSON	was known to the learned societies of this country and of the world as an investigator of wonderful originality , ability , and skill .

		Her work lay in the domain of organic chemistry , especially the chem - istry of plant products ; and it was her contention that the true taxonomy of vegetable forms lay revealed in their attainments in the construction of chemical compounds .

		This is not the place to enter upon extended criticism either of Mrs.
Michael	PERSON	's theories or her work ; suffice it to say that she has done more than any other woman in the
United States	LOCATION	to promote research in this particular field , and must be reckoned with hereafter by all , in all lands , who attempt work in the subtle chemistry of plants .

		Withal , Mrs.
Michael	PERSON	appears to have been a woman of charming personality , possessed of all the graces of her sex , and fortunate in an acquain - tance world-wide in its extent .

		The volume contains an extended biographical sketch ; an introduction to Mrs.
Michael	PERSON	's work in chemistry , by Dr.
Wiley	PERSON	; sixteen papers on organic chemistry , four of them in German ; and four literary papers which discuss such themes as '' Science and Philosophy in Art , '' `` The Drama in Relation to Truth , ''
Whitman	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, etc. .

		A photogravure porti-ait forms the frontispiece and shows the face of a most attractive .

		, A glamour is inevitably cast about A famous & t i \ - c i Frenchwoman the memory oi a beautitul woman and her friends , jjjjg Madame R ^ camier , who during the first half of the nineteenth century had in her court men that , politically , socially , and intellectually , were the most prominent in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	has given a comprehensive account of this famous Frenchwoman in his book entitled '' Madame R ^ camier and Her Friends '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Virtuous , sympathetic , and tactful , she seems to have been able to fill her salon with notable personages of widely varied schools and opinions , and of all grades of social rank .

		Soldiers and dandies of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, statesmen and diplomats of the Restoration , poets and novelists of constitutional
France	LOCATION	, all paid her homage .

		Mathieu de Montmorency ,
Prince Augustus	PERSON	of
Prussia	LOCATION	,
Ballanche	LOCATION	,
Canova	LOCATION	, Benjamin Constant ,
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	.

		and Chateaubriand Letters on the were her devoted friends .

		Since , as has been aptly observed , her career runs like a fine silver thread through the web of history and is inseparable from it , the reader of her biogi-aphy receives , in a desultory way , some vivid pictures of the times .

		Were this not true , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	might be said to lack an excuse for his work , since
Madame R	ORGANIZATION	^ camier had no creative ability and her talent was merely social .

		But granting the raison d'etre of the biography , it may be said that the author has conscientiously studied the life of his heroine , together with those of her friends as they affected hers , and presents the results in a pleasant , easy manner , which makes the book an entertaining one .

		Seventeen letters of
W. Ostwald	PERSON	, , , ... which appeared pai ` tiallv in the art of immtiny ... „ ' ^ ^ , ' o - kit ■ , scientific supplement or a
Munich	LOCATION	newspaper dm ` ing the years 1903-4 , compose the '' Letters to a Painter , '' which are translated by Mr.
H. W. Morse	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these letters , Mr.
Ostwald	PERSON	discusses the methods in the technique of painting ; • the various processes , their advantages and limitations .

		He makes a definite plea for a knowledge of science in art , and insists that unconscious inspiration must gfive way to conscious understanding of the processes and methods of work .

		The art student will find in these letters much food for reflection , particularly in the treatment of media , their optical characteristics and results .

		The general reader , perhaps , unable to cope with Mr.
Ostwald	PERSON	's theories , wUl nevertheless learn from the book many interesting facts concerning the art of painting .

		By means of concise explanations , the technical terms necessary to the subject-matter are made intelligible even to the layman .

		In his book on
Amerigo Vespucci	PERSON	in Thenaviesake ^ ^ ^ a Heroes of American HistoiT '' of
America	LOCATION	... \ ■ ```` ■ ti i • `` series -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr. l < rederic
A. Ober	PERSON	not only gives , in concise readable fomi , all the details known of the life of the Florentine navi - gator and explorer , but entei-s into a discussion of the fortuitous circumstances by which for three centuries after his death Amerigo was regarded as having robbed
Columbus	LOCATION	of the credit of his great discovery and of having foisted his own name upon the newly-found continent .

		The conclusion is reached that a great injustice was done to Amerigo , and that it was due wholly to circumstances in no way influenced by him that the name
America	LOCATION	instead of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	was conferred upon the new continent , while the actual exploits of Amerigo entitled him to the position in which the German biograpTiers placed him four himdred years ago .

Edinburgh	LOCATION	society .

		Xor has Mr.
Fyf	PERSON	e neglected his opportonities .

		The memoin of the period , with
Lockhart	PERSON	's work as one of the most important , hare been diligently searched and freely drawn upon .

		The personal element is made much of , and many pleasing character sketches , with some good anecdotes , are given .

		Of all books , this one should have had an index -- if only for the convenience of busy reviewers .

		In this initial volume ^ Mr.
Christopher St. John	PERSON	furnishes a sketch of Miss
Terry	PERSON	's career and personality , which contains appreciations of her acting and interest - ing items eonnecting her with the dnunatic hfe of her time .

		The volume presents a sympathetic , orderiy , and authoritative sketch , carefuUy written aiid adequately illustrated .

		The late
Frederick Eli Dewhurst	PERSON	was a
Congrega	ORGANIZATION	- tional minister who impressed all who came to know him with his spiritual earnestness and intellectual sin - cerity .

		He was not a popular preacher , for he scorned the sensational methods and rhetorical artifices by which preachers become popular , but he satisfied to a rare degree the wants of those who go to church for ethical and intellectual sustenance .

		The last years of his ministzy were spent in a church near the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and it is peculiarly appropriate that the Press of that
University	ORGANIZATION	should issue a volume of his sermons . ''

		The Investment of Truth '' is the title of the volume , which includes sixteen sermons , written during the last two years of Mr.
Dewhurst	PERSON	's life .

		They are provided with a sympathetic introduction by
Ptotesam Albion W. Small	ORGANIZATION	.

		County Berks , in
England	LOCATION	, is interesting as having for its northern boundary - the upper waters of the Thames for a hundred miles of its course , and containing within its borders
Windsor	LOCATION	and its famous castle .

		It has further interest in having been the home of '' Fair Rosamond '' in the twelfth cemur > ~ and of
Amy Rt	ORGANIZATION	^ wnrt in the axteenth .

		It has also within its bordos the famous White Horse Hill , the puzzle of antiquaries , besides the average picturesque bits of English scenery ; and it is otherwise rich in material for gossip and com - ment , such as is in demand for the volumes of the '' Highways and Byways Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Never - theless the volume demands of its author a good deal of padding and chatting about inconsequential things , to bring it up to the standard size set for that series of topographical books .

		The author , Mr.
James Edmund Vmcent	PERSON	, is a newspaper correspondent , who has sought the highways and byways of his adc ^ > ted county , as he calls it , on a bicycle , and with good resnits .

		Hb pen rtms on and fills out his stint of pag < es , and the scenes are well chosen for illustration by Mr.
Frederick L. Grigg	PERSON	with remarkable sneeess as to pictaresqne effeete ; so that the book , while perhaps not the most entertain - ing of the series in which it belongs , is certainly not the least so .

		The city of
San Francisco	LOCATION	has honored both literature and itself by the appointment of Dr.
Edward Rol > e.son Taylor	PERSON	to the office of the mayoralty ' .

		There is no reason -LRB- despite the jx -RRB- i -RRB- ular prejutlice to the contrary -RRB- why a good -RCB- X -RRB- et shoidd not make a good administrator , and we exjject that Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	will apply to his new -LRB- iWc ta.sk the same nicety of discriminating judg - ment that he has applied to his translation of Here < lia .

		The literary mayor is not altogether a noveltj ' in our public life , since Mr.
Brand	PERSON	\ \ Tiitlock offers us another example in
Toledo	LOCATION	, and even the mayor of
New York	LOCATION	is the author of a highly ci-etlitable monograph upon Venetian history - .

		Had it not been for the lamentable defeat of Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	, when he sought the votes of the unappreciative citizens of
Yonkers	LOCATION	a few yeai `` S ago , another shining name might have been added to our list .

		The faculties of the humorist ai-e no less likely than those of the poet to find fitting exercise in the control of civic affairs .

		The legislative fimc - tion quite frequently develojjs humorists ; why .

		shoultl we not now and then choose for its per - foi-mance a jester whose quality is already known to the public '' ?

		As for the novelist , is he not , by the very nature of his calling , an authority upon political and social conditioiLS , an exposer of the very evils that law-makers have it for theii - duty to destroy ?

		It was by his title of novelist that Mr.
Rwth Tarkington	PERSON	made his way into the legislative councils of his native
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		When Mr.
Winston Churclull	PERSON	got into the legislature of
New Hamjjshire	LOCATION	, did not the corruptionists shake in their boots , and the representatives of the railroad monopoly turn their thoughts toward the .

		By all means let us have humorists and novelists in greater numbei-s -- and poets too -- among our i-epre - sentatives at the state capitals .

		There is no public office to which literature may not climb in an age which has chosen a man of lettei-s to be the President of the
Unitetl States	LOCATION	.

		We do not imagine that '' The Winning of the West ' '' alone would have won for Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	the distinction of the chief magistracy , but there is a legitimate source of gratitication 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, in the fact that the most exalted office in the land is filled by a man who has an honorable position among American historians and essay - ists .

		There is hardly another example in our history of a President having lit ^ iury distinction apart from his office , although something might be said on this score for
Jefferson	PERSON	and for
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	.

		Some of our Presidents have had their '' works '' posthumously published in imposing sets of volumes , but the voliunes be - long , for the most pai `` t , in Lambs category of books that are not books .

		In the past , the rule of our public life seems to have been that a few foreign legations and consulates might properly be awarded to gentle - men of the literary profession , although even this largess has been rather grudgingly doled out .

		It has never been altogether true to say with the satirist that '' We 're oiJy kuowii In courts where Adauis trtxl and
Franklin	PERSON	shone , By mute Ambassadors who grandly scorn to Maim any language save the one they 're born to , '' for the early appointments of
Joel Barlow	PERSON	as minister to
France	LOCATION	and
Irving	PERSON	as minister to Spaui established a literary tradition in the diplomatic service which has been occasionally observed ever since .

		The names of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	and
Taylor	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	occui - at once to the mind as among the most conspicuous that have ever jitlomed that service , while mention of the con - sular service as promptly suggests
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Howells	PERSON	,
Harte	PERSON	, and a host of others .

		The briUiant success of our men of letters in these important public positions abroad might projjerly have suggested similar experiments at home .

		It has done so in occasional instances , although we can not at the moment recall either a postmaster-poet or an excise-essayist .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	, it will be remembered , occupied a petty government office until some one discov - ered that he was a poet , whereupon he was summarily dismissed I The late
John Hay	PERSON	as
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	offers our best recent example of a man of lettei-s in high official station , but it was rumored tliat the years of his officialdom brought him to the opinion that his most dis - tinctive litei-ary perfoi-mances had been sins of his youth for which he hoped to be forgiven .

		Litei-atiu ' C appears to receive somewhat more of public recognition -LRB- although none too much -RRB- in
England	LOCATION	than it does in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We remember that
Burns	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	were excise officers , and we take a certain pride in the fact that a poet and a diumatic critic , Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	and Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	, ai-e , respectively , efficient public public servants in the
Board of Tratle	ORGANIZATION	and the
Post-Office Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		A mere essayist , Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, is next to the Prime Min - ister the most conspicuous figure in the present Government , while the leader of the opixjsition , Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, is a gi-aceful , if not a profound , metaphysician .

		Imagination balks at the effort to figure our own party leaders as either essay - ists or metajjhysicians .

		We do occasionally discover men of letters strayed by accident into the halls of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, -- '' Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto , '' -- but we do not find that generous sprinklmg of them that we observe in the avei-age
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover ,
England	LOCATION	has in the laureateship one public post to which poets alone are eligible , which fact is clearly an official feather in the cap of literature .

		Even royalty sometimes gi-aces litei-ature , not merely with patronage , but with actual per - formance .


Jidius Cffisar	PERSON	was a man of letters -LRB- as schoolboys know -RRB- , and a very great man of letters in the opinion of so high an authority as
Signor	PERSON	Fen-ero .

		Nero was not the poet he thought himself , but he held his art in projjer esteem .

		All men of English race take pride ui the litei-ary activities of Alfred the Great .

		In our own day , the
King of Sweden	ORGANIZATION	and the Queen of Roumania are authors who woidd be taken seriously even if they did not occupy tlu-ones , while the German Emperor , just because he occupies one , is taken seriously enough by his entourage when he drops into jroeti-y .

		Having thus in our progress reached the pinnacle of rank , any further illustrations of literature in office would have the effect of an anti-climax , for which i-eason it seems best tliat no more be said .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A FACTITIOUS DEMAND FOR AN AUTHOR 's WORKS is always created when that author marries , dies , divorces his wife or is liimself divorced by her , or otherwise does or says sometliing that gets his name into the newspapers . ''

		We are obliged , '' says one of the assistants in a large public library , ' • to watch the daily papei-s studiously in order to keep prepared for the demand for certain books and the works of cei ` tain authors .

		Whenever a prominent author dies , gets married , or figures prominently in the news - papers in any way , there is sure to follow within a day or two a greatly increased demand for his books .

		The same is true when a novel is dramatized . ''

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's '' American Commonw ^ ealth '' has of late enjoyed a renewed vogue -- or , at least , the first volume has ; for it is surprising -LRB- no , not surprising , human nature being what it is -RRB- how many pei-sons yield to this sudden impulse to read an author , but

		53 ncTer get beyond a volume or two .

		Thus all our public libraries show mnltitades of rebound and re-rebound first volumes , a lesser number of shabby second volumes , and a prett -RCB- * uniform display of third and subsequent volumes of increasing imma `` - nlateness as we approach the end of the set .

		This state of things tells of a culture far other than that which develops steadily and silently from an inner principle , working itself out more and more into a self-poised and symmetrical whole .

		There are two classes of readers that are notably free from the outside influences above mentioned : they are the staid and sensible older readers , and the ever - conservative juvenile frequenters of the library , to whom * •
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' is as delightful as it was to their great-great-grandfathers .

		Theirs is the kingdom of literature , in its best sense .

		• • • Spadt 's litekakt awakexxxg is becoming a subject of frequent approving comment .

		A scholarly writer in La Revue -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- says that at last Spanish authors • • have placed themselves in contact with the vibrant and sincere soul of the multitude . ''

		They have ' ■ • transformed their sentiments , their processes , their verj - vocabularies , in such manner that it is not difBcnlt to predict the flowering of a vigorous and original art worthy of
Spain	LOCATION	's historic greatness .

		... The novel has been ennobled and developed to the point of becoming the very opposite of what it had been at the close of the nineteenth century .

		... In the hands of the new-comers it gains vigor in that it appears to emanate from the verj - soul of the j > eople ... Two traits in particular charac - terize the work of this great modem group : the perfecting of style , formerly diicoixlant and riotous , and the successful effort to escape from those gran - diloquent and irregular formulas which made the reading of earlier novels tedious . ''

		And thus , we are assured , • • the way is opened for the triumph of sincerity and the final overthrow of rhetoric '' In the other branches of literature also .

		es -RSB- > ecially in poetrj - , the drama , and criticism , the same demo - cratic tendencies are asserting themselves .

		Fur - thermore , a political transformation to match the literary revolution is confidently predicted .

		It does reallj - seem as if drowsy old
Spain	LOCATION	, with her young king , her new queen , her infant crown-prince , her lately achieved freedom from colonial dogs , and her newly-hatched brood of singing birds , were respond - ing to the quickening influences of modern life .

		• • • A QtrEKT FOK THE vuLL SEASOX , and one which many an idle dreamer has already asked , is this : Can it be that the ancients lived in a present that was as real and as matter-of-fact to them as our present is to us ?

		Yes , we venture to answer , and a good deal more so -- excepting , perhaps , the era of the Renaissance and the brave days of Elizabethan voyaging and discovery .

		We live in an age of rapidl -RRB- - increasing wonders that would have driven the hungriest novelty-seeker of
Athens	LOCATION	dizzy with amazement A converse query , not so often heard .

		is this : Will our very real and very modem pre - sent ever take on the ancient aspect and clothe itself in the vague mists that attach to the period of Rameses the Great ?

		To this also we reply with an emphatae yes .

		With things material and spiritual taking new shapes and gaining new meanings every day .

		how can the men and women of the sisrtieth century fail to regard the reality of our existence with the same incredulity that fills us on contem - platii ^ , for example , the ruins of
Nineveh	LOCATION	or
Thebes	LOCATION	?

		This thought may make the novmess of this year of grace

		A TRULY ENCTCLOPJKDIC EKCTCLOP.KDIA , if one may judge by its size , is the famous Chinese Ency - clopaedia prepared by Chinese scholars nearly two centuries ago , issued in
5020	DATE	volumes -LRB- limited to ICK -RRB- sets -RRB- , and known to the
Western	LOCATION	world chiefly through the highly prized copy in the British Mu - seum .

		Renewed attention is at this time called to the mammoth Chinese work because of the retire - ment of Sir
Robert Douglass	PERSON	from the custodian - ship of Oriental printed hooks and manuscripts in the Museum .

		It was through his efforts , about fifteen years ago , that a set of the ponderous ency - clopedia was secured .

		A certain Chinese prince was pinched for ready cash , and offered his copy of the work in question for sale .

		But as he would not part with it to a foreigner , some little scheming was necessary to obtain it for
England	LOCATION	.

		Through the agency of a discreet middleman the
5020	DATE	volumes were safely delivered , in fifteen cartloads , at the door of the British Legation , and in due time forwarded to
London	LOCATION	.

		The work , besides being a compendium of all Chinese knowledge at its date of pnUieation , is adorned with many quaint illustra - tions .

		Sir
Robert	PERSON	, its erstwhile guardian , is accounted an authority on things Chinese , and his retirement will be regretted .

		... A POVEETT-STEICKEN ' CREATOK OF UtAGIX ART WEALTH is somewhat piathetically presented to our view In the person of that prolific producer of splen - did romance .

		Madame de la
Ram ^	ORGANIZATION	, otherwise known as `` Ouida . ' ''

		After luxuriating , with her tens of thousands of readers , in all the elegant superfluities that money can buy -LRB- in the pages of a novel -RRB- , tlie unfortunate lady is said now to be hardly able to command the bare necessities .

		She who seemed born to live in princely palaces and to dispense hospitali ^ with queenly hand , is reported to have fallen into a state of dej -RRB- endence on her own serv - ants , a condition from which , however , she was fortunately rescued by a pension from the British government .

		The pecuniary relief was small , but , whatever its amount , there will be satisfaction felt that the contributor to the pleasure -- we even ven - ture to say , the innocent pleasure -- of so many of her ooimtiywomen , and of her countrjiuen in smaller 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, numbers , has at least been freed from the g ^ im dread of starvation .

		Well would it have been for this woman , so generously endowed with creative imagi - nation , could she have received also from some kind fairy a slight intermixture of conservative prudence among the gifts bestowed on her at birth .

		Surely , a little tlirift in her days of prosperity would have safeguarded her from her present straits .

		• • • Literary events in
Tokyo	LOCATION	receive no promi - nent mention in our newspapei-s , but from late Japanese journals we are pleased to learn that inter - est in the latest European and American literature is keen among the educated classes .

		Premier
Saionji	PERSON	has been giving dinners to novelists , poets , and other writers , and there seems to have been much good talk at these gatherings on books and authors of other countries besides
Japan	LOCATION	.

		A char - acteristic feature of the banquets was the impromptu writing of sentiments , verses , or even plain signa - tures , on '' spotless silk , '' as souvenirs of the occa - sion .

		The applause elicited by some of these extemporaneous efforts appears to us , it must be confessed , a little excessive .

		For example , we read that '' among others ,
Rohan	PERSON	won the praise of all by writing in his maidy caligi-aphy -LSB- a Japanese verse , thus translated -RSB- : ' On the
Musashi	ORGANIZATION	plain vegetation gtows free in its varied beauty . ' ''

		But the charm of poetry is untranslatable , and we nmst , in our ignorance of Japanese , take the rare beauty of these specimens on trust .

		Among English and American books advertised by
Tokyo	LOCATION	booksellers are to be noted
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's '' Agnostic 's Apology '' and Dr.
WUliam James	PERSON	's '' Varieties of Religious Experience . ''

		Free-thought is nowhere more at home than in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		• `` • A WAVE OF LITERARY PlTRITANISM , or Something like it , appears to be sweeping over
England	LOCATION	and engidfing her educational authorities .

		Kingsley 's '' Westward Ho I '' has been blacklisted at
Tilbury	ORGANIZATION	, and
the London Education Committee	ORGANIZATION	has declared ''
Mary Barton	PERSON	'' unfit for juvenile reading .

		Mrs.
GaskeU	PERSON	, it is alleged , is guilty of admitting to her book sundry disquieting '' references to immoral doings '' ; and the descriptions of riots in
Lanca	LOCATION	- shire would * ' rdnd the hearts of young children . ''

		Children must , no one would dispute , sooner or later learn to distinguish between good and evil ; but the method of training here adopted can not but suggest the inadequate natatory drill of the girl immortalized in nursery rhyme .

		The boys and girls of
Britain	LOCATION	will become objects of pity when
Marryat	ORGANIZATION	and
Stevenson	PERSON	and perhaps even Miss Yonge and Mrs.
Marshall	PERSON	are put under lock and key , and the most exciting literature allowed is furnished by the ''

		... A LIBRARY REPORT ON A NEW PLAN is that pre - pared by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, librarian of the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library .

		Its arrangement of topics is alphabetical , with occasional cross - references .

		This is a time-saving device , and though the dictionary plan may have been used by other librarians , this is the fii-st instance we have noticed of its employment in this connection .

		The
Newark	LOCATION	library occupies a line new building -- that is , new six years ago -- and under Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's headship it is doing good work in all its many departments .

		It maintains police-station and post-ofiice libraries , sends out to otlier cities and towns a noteworthy book - binding exhibit , opens its rooms for the meetings of ninety-one literary , educational , charitable and other organizations , gives lessons on the use of its facilities , circulates annually a number of books nearly equal to twice the population of the city , issues more than two hundred mimeograph bulletins and lists to aid readers , and engages in many other praiseworthy enterprises .

		Evidently the new librarian and the new building have given a fresh impetus to library activity in
Newark	LOCATION	.

		... A
Byron Memorial	ORGANIZATION	in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	is among the possibilities of the near future .

		Mr.
Charles Rathbone Law	PERSON	, the historian , is reported as actively interested in the matter ; and he must have a considerable following in all English-speaking lands .

		It appears that when
Byron	PERSON	died .

		Dean
Ireland	LOCATION	refused to let his remains be buried in the
Abbey	LOCATION	; and it has been plausibly conjectured that his motives were the same as those suggested by
Henley	PERSON	when he wrote : '' Two obvious reasons why
Byron	PERSON	has long been a prophet more honored abroad than at home are his life and his works . ''

		But there are many monuments in
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	erected to genius rather than virtue , and some bear testi - mony to neither .

		There are even kings of
England	LOCATION	reposing beneath its pavement who might find it hard to show cause why they should not have been excluded from the sacred precincts .

		... Public libraries in .

		the South are almost as rare as violets in
October	DATE	.


Georgia	LOCATION	, one of the least backward of
Southern States	LOCATION	in library progress , has only eight free public libraries that occupy their own buildings , with three more in process of construction .

		This information is found in a ' • Handbook of the Libraries of the

Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		It contains also an account of
the State Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, the library laws of
Georgia	LOCATION	, the
Georgia Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and an illustrated summary of public libraries in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our great South , with its dearth of libraries , ought to make Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	take heart of grace : there is stUl hope that he need not die disgracefully rich , so numerous are the unlibraried cities and villages awaiting the bestowal of his bounty .

		... IMONUMENTAL NEGLECT OF DiCKENS is perhaps the appropriate phrase for the astonishing lack of that sort of visible memorial of the great novelist which one would have most confidently looked for in
London	LOCATION	.

		But though thirty-five years have passed since he died , no bust to perpetuate his memory has until now been on view in any public spot in the city .

		In this word , which has rushed into extraordinarv popularity and common use within the last two or three years , so that it can hardly be called any longer mere slan ^ we have another example of the degradation of a oaee honorable word .

		One of Dean
Treiieh	ORGANIZATION	's p < ^ u -RSB- ar books on the English language discusses such changes with several examples .

		Such are '' knave '' and '' churl , '' the first of which meant boy , then servant , at last rogue ; the second meant man , especially a strong man , and next a rude man , as one who presumes on bjs strength .

		Now if anyone has puzzled himself in tiying to con - nect this new word of opprobriiun with the horticultural operation whereby a twig is inserted into a tree to win a new source of life , let him understand that he is look - ing in the wrong direction .

		Forty or fifty years ago , `` graft , '' which has succeeded the less euphonious `` boodle , '' meant one 's regular occupation or bosiness .

		See
Hotten 's Slang Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, which gives no other meaning -LRB- date about 1865 -RRB- .

		When one EngUsh work - man asked another , '' What is your graft ? ''

		he imputed uo dishonor .

		The answer involved the name of a trade : '' I 'm a mason , '' or '' I 'm a tanner . ''

		In fact , it was a slight mispronunciation of the word craft , familiar to readers of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	in the nineteenth chapter of Acts , in the story of the tumult at Epbesus .

		Demetrius the silversmith said , '' Bv this craft we have our wealth ... this our craft is in dan - ger . ''

		The Revised Version substitutes the words '' business '' and '' trade . ''

		While the words '' handi - craft '' and '' craftsman '' have retained their dignity , • • crafty '' has passed from its orig ^ inal meaning , skilful , into the disgrace of tricky , deceitful .

		`` Craft '' is dropping out of use ; hence the revisers used those other words , and its derivative '' graft '' is sorely degraded .

Philip Dormer Stanhope	PERSON	, fourth
Earl of Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	, believed the end and aim of our mortal existence to be the repression of spontaneities and the assiduous cultivation of elegant artificialities .

		His excessive regard for externals , and his cynical disbelief in anything genuine behind the mask , helped to make his the '' age of prose , of lying , of sham , the fraudulent-bankrupt century , '' that
Carlyle	PERSON	so mercilessly railed at , at the same time that he chose not a few of his heroes -- his
Friedrich	PERSON	, his Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	, his
Johnson	PERSON	and his
Burns	PERSON	-- from the middle and end of that era of corruption and cant .

		Mr.
W. H. Craig	PERSON	announces , in a brief preface to his '' Life of
Lord Chesterfield	PERSON	, '' the motive that has prompted him to add to the '' already over-crowded list of writings '' on the courtly
Earl	PERSON	.

		He believes that hitherto enough , and more than enough , attention has been given '' to his private life and correspondence , and to his wit , his savoir / aire , his peculiar system of practical ethics , his sallies into the field of literature , his theory of the ' Graces , ' and his various questionable proclivities '' ; but that too little has been devoted '' to the con - sideration of those rarer and higher qualities which distinguished him as a valuable public servant to whose ability , zeal , energy , political foresight , incorruptibility , and dexterity En - gland is more indebted than she appears to recognize at present . ''

		Therefore he avoids dwelling on the former and more familiar attri - butes , and seeks to emphasize the latter .

		The i-ecord of
Lord Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's public services is open to all ; but how far they were disinterested services , and how far prompted by personal and selfish motives , is matter for debate .

		flattering picture of the man .

		A glimpse of
Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	in a role that well suited him is afforded in the following passage descriptive of his ambassadorial life at The Hague ; the para - graph furnishes also a fair sample of the writer 's impartial treatment of his theme . ''

		His new vocation was pleasant to a man of his temperament , who , though he affected to be ' simph ' a man of pleasure , ' was m reality fond of work and desirous of pleasing others .

		... A remarkable instance of his desii'e to conciliate those whose opinions might differ ever so widely from his own , is afforded by hLs account of an incident , by which , as he remarks , ' I have acquired some degree of reputation . ' '

		You must know , ' he proceeds -LSB- in a letter to Lady Suffolk -RSB- , ` that last
Sunday	DATE	I treated the people here with an English cliristening in my chapel of a Black-a-moor boy that I have , liaving had him first instructed fully in the

		That he was an assiduous man of business is evident from the references we meet with in his correspondence with the

Lord Townshend	PERSON	's repeated tributes to his zeal and activity .

		His store of energy was inexliaustible .

		Lord Chesterfield 's gi-eatest public service was the introtluction of the reformed or Gregorian calendar into

March	DATE	, while all other European countries , except
Russia	LOCATION	and

		Of course the popular resistance to a change -- to the acceptance of a calendar amended by a Pope of

Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's eloquence carried Parliament with him , and the new order went into effect in

Lord Macclesfield	ORGANIZATION	and Dr.

		For instance , he writes : '' It is not the object of these pages to whitewash
Chesterfield	LOCATION	.

		He was not a ' good man ' in the conven - tioual sense of the term , but one of those who assign to esi -RRB- ediency that position which is the right of conscience ; and readers mast be left to decide how far , considering the time in which he Uved and the special object he had in view , he was justified in laving down such a code of morals as the Laten contain for the guidance of his son .

		When we come to discuss his precepts as to manners and deportment , we find ourselves upon firmer ground , though , even here , the march of time has played havoc with much of his wisdom .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	averred that , ' leaving out the immoralitj - , the Letters might be made a very pretty book which should be put into the hands of every young gentleman ; ' and to a certain extent this is true , though young gentlemen of the present day would be slow , and very justly , to accept his lordship 's code of manners .

		Toltunes on the history of Costume ?

		From page to page the reader wavers between the two expressions , smiling over the grotesque and incongruous fixings , sighing over the extrava - gance , the discomfort , the ugliness .

		Fortu - i nately , however , both authors take an indidgent j attitude toward the facts thej ^ record , so that I under their influence the smile is likely to pre - i dominate , though chastened by consciousness of pathos .

		For the manner of both recortls , the reader can have littie but praise .

		Both authors are fully responsive to their subjects , both describe clearly and fuUy , and both know the value of plentiful illustrations .

		Mrs.
Aria	PERSON	, writing much the smaller book , takes a wider range of subject , and treats it eclecticaUy .

		After brief but in - cisive comment on Greek , Roman , and mediseval dress , she gives a chapter to the most striking characteristics of costume in each century from the thirteenth through the nineteenth .

		While English costume is chiefly considered , there are iUimiinating glimpses of German , French , and Italian fashions , at corresponding times .

		Added chapters on peasant , oriental , bridal , dancing , ceremonial , and threatrical dress will make the volmne a lamp and a guide to those in search of inspiration for fancy dress costumes .

		The text is often witty and always interesting .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	, the illustrator , can scarcely be over - praised for the excellence of his work .

		Hating all ugliness , he deftly turns a picturesque aspect of even the most impossible fashions toward us .

		How he manages to make them so attractive is past comprehension , unless it is by associating them with beautiful faces .

		Who would not wear a monstrous hennin on her locks , or a ship in full sail , or even horns a yard long , if by so doing she coidd look as winsome as these pictured ladies ?

		Even to Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	in full panoply of peace -LRB- and was ever panoply of war so formid - able ? -RRB-

		he gives a face as sweet as the traditional dairymaid 's .

		The sixteen colored plates are a delight to behold , with form and line studied to the perfection of grace , and colors so delicate and so weU blended that they fairly melt in the eye .

		Between author and illustrator , the reader closes the book with a thoroughly kindly feeling toward departed fashions , though with the hope that there is no impiety in being thankful they are departed .

		Intensively , Mr.
Calthrop	PERSON	is much more ambitious in his book , though he confines his attention to English costume .

		Of this his treat - ment is so thorough as to merit for his work the old-fashioned phrase '' a complete compen -

August 1	DATE	, dium . ''

		Each reign , from the Conqueror 's down , receives a chapter impartially divided between the wear of men and of women , and illustrated with two full-page figures in color .

		These seventy canvases -- one can scarcely speak of them as anything less -- destine the book to be used chiefly as that most delectable of creations , a picture-book for '' grown-ups , '' with educational value enough to salve the mature conscience for enjoying such things .

		This destiny is ma < le more sure by half-tone reproductions of some thirty engravings by
Hollar	PERSON	and sixty by the Dightons , with innu - merable line-tlrawings by the author .

		Mr.
Calthrop	PERSON	is his own illustrator , and oft `` n says `` If I ca n't describe this , I can draw it . ''

		His use of color is daring , but his artistic sense is as sure as it is cheerful ; so that his portrait gallery , though higher in tone than Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's , is equally grateful to the eye .

		In his drawings , his sense of humor is often appar - ent .

		What matter whether the sketch is pretty or not , if it correctly represents the fact ?

		In his writing , Mr.
Calthrop	PERSON	is something less of an artist .

		Still , in making a conij -RRB- endium , he could hardly avoid packing his facts .

		After the enormous amount of research , it is remark - able that he can handle his subject as lightly as he does .

		Interesting and reatlable he certainly is , in spite of an occasional sli ^ -RRB- in idiom or construction .

		He has a happy faculty for mak - ing his costumes live , as it were , in the times to which they belong .

		Taking his stand in
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's shop at the beginning of
Edward IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		's reign , he says : '' You will notice that all , or nearly all , the passers - hy
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's have long hair ; that the dandies have extra - long hair brushed out in a cloud at the back ; that the older men wear long , very simple gowns , which they belt in at the waist with a stuff or leather belt , on which is himg a bag-purse ; that these plain gowns are laced across the front to the waist over a vest of some colored stuff other tlian the gown ... Edward himself has been to the shop , and has consented to become patron of an edition of Tidly , -- Edward with his verj ' subtle face , his tall , handsome appearance , his cold , elegant manners .

		He is dressed in a velvet gown edged with fur ; the neck of the gown is low , and the silk vest shows above it .

		Across his chest are gold laces taper - ing to his waist ; these are strait across the front of his gown-opening .

		His hair is strait and falls to the nape of his neck .

		The skirts of his gown reach to his knees , and are fur-edged ; his sleeves are full at the elbows and tight over his wrists ; he is wearing red Spanish leather tall boots , turned over at the top . ''

		This vivifying method , together with the fact that Mr.
Calthrop	PERSON	does not forget to describe the dress of the common people , will render the book invaluable to students of history .

		Equally satisfactory is his evolutionary sense , by which he traces the continuous development of new species from old ; he not only declares that the liripipe came from the peak of the hood , the vest from the surcoat , and the coat from the timic , but shows by description and drawing how it all happened .

		He believes , too , in the causal connection between life and clothes , and the doubts which that belief gives ri.se to atld the spice of imanswered inquiry to his pages .

		He can go so far as to say that '' a fashion is born , not maxle . ''

		But whether clothes result from character or character from clothes , he has not yet decided .

		It is much , however , to keep before us the Sartor-philosophy that '' in this one pregnant subject of Clothes , rightly understood , is included all that men have thought , dreamed , done , or been , '' and we shall not blame him if he could not , any more than
Sartor	PERSON	himself , tell us just how the inclusion came about .

		Ten Famous Frenchmen .

		* Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	's '' Life of Voltaire , '' published a few years ago , was favorably received , and aroused renewed interest in the character and career of the man who stood for liberty when the word , for
France	LOCATION	, was nothing more than a historical expression .

		But
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, as is well known , was only one -- though the leatling one -- of a cluster of great names , the '' alpha , '' as astronomers say , of a constellation which illu - minates that part of the heavens of history known as the eighteenth century .

		It was inevitable that Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	, while prosecut - ing his Voltairean studies , should have become profoundly interested in the other thinkers and philo-sophers whose lives and writings constituted a noble protest against the age-long tyranny whose knell they helped to sound .

		These by - products of his researches he has now gathered into a volume which forms a valuable supple - ment to his
Life of Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and will be welcomed by all atlmirers of that book . ''

		The Friends of Voltaire '' is cast in the form of anecdotal biography , and tells the stories of ten men whose lives fell very closely together , the earliest birth among them dating from
1713	DATE	, and only one of them -LRB-
Grimm	LOCATION	-RRB- living into the nineteenth century -LRB- 1807 -RRB- .

		THE DIAL 59 less closely associated with one another .

		Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	endeavors to characterize them by giving each an identifying label , as follows : D'Alembert the Thinker , Diderot the Talker ,
Galiani	PERSON	the Wit .

		Vauvenargues the Aphorist , D'Holbach the Host .

		Grimm the Journalist , Helvetius the Contratliction , Turgot the States - man , Beaumarchais the Playwright .

		Condorcet the Aristocrat .

		At one period or another in his long and stormy life ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	was brought into touch with these apostles of liberalism .

		Some of them knew him but slightly , and he did not hesitate to criticize them caustically enough at times : but on the whole , as the author says . '

		• their aim was his aim , to destroy from among the people * ignorance , the curse of God ' '' : and they , like him . ''

		were the prophets and the makers of a new dispensation . ''

		So the term ' • Friends of Voltaire '' is not Ul-chosen .

		The ten studies are of nearly the same length , but of varying merit : the most penetra - tion and sjTupathy being shown in the papers on D'Alembert and
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	, the creators of the famous
Enoyclop & lic	ORGANIZATION	.

		The gay little abbe
Galiani	PERSON	is sketched with something of his own incisive wit , and the good-natured '' mmtre tj ' hotel of philosophy . '' '

		the rich
Baron d'Holbach	PERSON	, whose hospitable homes in the
Rue Royale	LOCATION	and at Grandval were for nearly thirty years head - quarters for the wits and celebrities of all nations , is given a meed of gratitude as having provided the remhzvou '' for those who were engagetl in the great intellectual revival of the time .

		Vauvenargues , the author of a single lxx -RRB- k , is perhaps the most winning face that looks upon us from the walls of this little gal - lerj - .

		A Rochefoucaidd without the cynicism , his maxims leave only a good taste in the mouth and a good impidse in the heart .

		Prosperity - soured La Rochefoucauld ; adversity traine < l and sweetenetl Vauvenargues , and we may , with Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	, say of him that the flippant and false , clever and silly eighteenth centurs * is '' in some sort redeemed by the brave silent life and the high ideals he proved practical and not visionary by fulfilling himself , of this soldier aphorist . ''

		In this decade of essayists , probably the least articidate was the statesman Turgot : but he wrought with all the powers God and man had given him for the betterment of his oi > - pressed feUow-coimtr ^ nuen .

		It is a familiar story to the students of French history , but it is not one to be told with leWty ; and Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	, on approaching it .

		lays aside the spaiUing and debonair style which seemed an appropriate medium for
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and his friends .

		With grave and measured speech , as of one walking over a * battlefield , he sketches the eon - tlitions which prevailed in
France	LOCATION	during the reign of Louis the '' Well-beloved . '' ''

		Consider that these people had been scourged for genera - tions by hundreds of imjust and senseless laws , made by and for the benefit of their oppressors , ' and that they were now the ■ snctims of taxes whose very name has become an indictment and whose description is a justification of the French Revolution . ''

		Then follows a brief accoimt of the oppressive taiUe , corvee , mil ice , and guhelle , and of the still more frightful irregular burdens which could be imposed at any time by the autocrat at
Versailles	LOCATION	. ''

		What effect would hundreds of years of such oppres - sion hare on the character of the oppressed ?

		Hopeless , i filthy , degraded , superstitious with the cra - '' ien superstition which made them the easy prey of their unscrupulous olergT and left them wholly sensual and stupid ; as animals , without the animals ' instinctiTe joy of life and fearlessness of the morrow ; with no ambitions for them - selves or the children who turned to curse them for having brought them into such a world ; with no time to dream or love , no time for the tenderness which makes i life life indeed , -- they toiled for a few cruel years be - I caoae they feai `` i to die , and died because they feared to live .

		Such were the people
Turgot	PERSON	was sent to redeem . ''

		As Intendant of
Limoges	LOCATION	, and later as Con - troller-General of Finances , Turgot succeeded in alleviating many abuses which it would take a French Revolution to sweep entirely away .

		Of other friends of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, -- of Grimm the astute journalist .

		Helvetius the materialist , Beaimiarchais of `` Figaro '' renown , -- Mr.
Tallentyre	PERSON	writes with a light but assured touch , doing justice to their merits and their services in the great cause , and leaving of them all such convincing pen-picttires as almost to make needless the ten portraits with which the lx -RRB- ok is embellished .

		There are many glimpses , too , of the brilliant women whose gay and easy society was alike a relaxation and a stimiUus to these thinkers
and %	PERCENT	\ - riters -- from
Catherine the Great	PERSON	of
Russia	LOCATION	down to ilme .

		de Tencin , the intellectual but heartless mother of D'Alembert .

		This philo - sopher was later comforted , however , for his i mother 's desertion of him , by the companionship and affection of
Julie de Lespinasse	PERSON	; and the admirers of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	will appre - ciate the allusion to one of her later novels in the following paragraph : I '' The history of that menage , of the brilliant , impul - sive , undisciplined girl , with her plain face and her matchless charm , and of the blind old woman she 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, tended , deceived and outwitted , has been told in fiction as well as history .

		How , when
Madame du DefEand	ORGANIZATION	was asleep , her poor companion held for herself reunions of the bright particular stars of her mistress ' firmament , and how the old woman , rising a little too early one day , came into the room and with her sightless eyes saw all , is one of the familar anecdotes of literature . ''

		The book , throughout , is entertaining , and helpful to a clear understanding of a momentous and often misunderstood epoch in both history and literature .

		The Old British Engravers .

		* Mr.
Salaman	PERSON	's account of the old English engravers is a work of rare interest and enter - tainment .

		To the lover of the old copper-plate prints , who appreciates an engraving for its beauty , its charm , and its artistic merit , whether in line , in mezzotinto , or in stipple , the book will commend itself most highly , as it is written wholly from the artistic standpoint , with no consideration for the commercial side which measures the value of a print alone by its auction-room price .

		On this point the author says : '' I have liad no thought for that print - collector with whom considerations of ' state ' and margin are more urgent than the appeal of pictorial beauty or human interest .

		To him , the price at
Christie	ORGANIZATION	's will count , perhaps , for more than the intrinsic interest of the print , or the life-story of the engraver . ''

		THE DIAL 61 ages , the books being long since out of print and rare ; but by far the greater portion of the sources are in the public and private archives of
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		One gathers from what follows that Professor
Meany	PERSON	was fortunate enough to enlist the cooperation of a host of helpers at home and abi-oad , including the Lords Commissionei-s of the .

		Admii-alty , the
Elder Brethren of Trinity House	ORGANIZATION	, the Secretary of the
Spanish Royal Academy of History	ORGANIZATION	, and the Lieutenant-Governor of
British Columbia	LOCATION	, -- to mention no others , -- and that his ovm researches extendetl over many yeai-s .

		In face of all this it is somewhat disconcerting to discover that of the 340 pages in Professor
Meany	PERSON	's lx -RRB- ok some 280 are taken up with a verbatim reprint of
Vancouver	LOCATION	's narrative -LRB- pp. 33 to 385 of vol .

		II .

		of the second edition -RRB- .

		To this text Professor
Meany	PERSON	adds a number of foot-notes , for the most part , in the words of his sub-title , '' biographies of the men honored in the naming of geographic features of
Northwestern America	LOCATION	. ''

		The first sixty pages are occupie < l by an introduction , followed by brief biographies of
Vancouver	LOCATION	and Quadra , and an historic sketch of Xootka Sound .

		With a few trifling exceptions , the material embodied in these sixty pages is readily acces - sible elsewhere , as is also of course
Vancouver	LOCATION	's own narrative .

		There remain the foot-notes .

		These , indeed , reveal much patient research , and are unquestionably of interest and value as a commentary upon place-names occurring in
Vancouver	LOCATION	's narrative ; but they go far beyond the necessities of the case .

		For instance ,
Vancouver	LOCATION	named a low sandy point of land
New Dimgeness	LOCATION	, because of its resemblance to Dungeness in the English Channel .

		Professor
Meany	PERSON	not only gives a detailed description of the old Dungeness in his foot-note , with a chart of the harbor , but branches out into a descrip - tion of the old lighthouse at Dimgeness , with a photogi-aphic reproduction ; the lighthouse brings up the venerable institiition of
Trinity House	ORGANIZATION	, whose history is succinctly given ; and this again suggests the new lighthouse , a de - scription of which is clipped from an English newspaper .

		All this is doubtless interesting in its way , but does not seem very essential to an interpretation of
Vancouver	LOCATION	's narrative .

		In the Introduction , Professor
Meany	PERSON	quotes a number of passages from one of several logs , kept by officers and men of the '' Discovery '' and the ''
Chatham	LOCATION	, '' and now preserved in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	at
London	LOCATION	, a2iro2 -RRB- os of Sir
Joseph Banks	PERSON	's charge that
Vancouver	LOCATION	's discipline was harsh in the extreme .

		Why i these disjointed passages are pressed in to bol - ster up a charge which .

		Professor
Meany	PERSON	admits a page or two later , hatl no adequate foundation , it is difficult to imderstand ; but it is much more difficult to imderstand why , having access to this mine of contemporary material , he should have made no further use of it .

		One can think of many obscure points in
Vancouver	LOCATION	's nar - rative which might have been made clear by the evidence of these original records , if some of the energy devoted to the elucidation of quite irrelevant questions had been turned in this direction .

		All this soimds rather imgrateful , but it is disappointing to find so much genuine scholar - ship expended to , comparatively speaking , so little purpose .

August 1	DATE	, whose simple virtues react upon his own character , giving it strength and serious purpose .

		When for - tune unexpectedly comes to him , we feel tliat he fairly deserves it , as well as the love of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	maiden whose gentle influence has done so much for him .

		The story is essentially one of manners and customs -- the manners and customs of a rough age , and of both the higher and the lower classes of society .

		Gamblers , horse-thieves , blackguards , and rustics of many types figure in its pages .

		It is a story which exhibits much knowledge of men and affairs , a story which could not have been written by anyone not thoroughly imbued with the traditions of his race .

		It offei-s us the real thing , as distin - guished from the artificial fabrication of the novelist who '' gets up '' his subject . ''

		Katherine '' is the latest novel of Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	ORGANIZATION	.


Katherine Crighton	PERSON	was a young woman with a temperament .

		When her portrait -LRB- at the age of eighteen months -RRB- was exhibited in the galleries that fact was recognized , and it was generally pre - dicted that she would be heard from when she gi-ew up .

		When the eighteen months had become that number of years , or thereabouts , she married
John Spurrier	PERSON	,
Member of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then she dis - covered that she wanted to be loved , and concluded that
John	PERSON	did not love her in the right way .

		As a matter of fact , he loved her in the best way possible , but what she wanted was an effusive sentiment which it was not in his nature to bestow .

		So she allowed a philandering military gentleman to captivate her fancy .

		Presently she heard her death-warrant from the lips of a physician .

		She was a victim of cancer , and had not more than two years to live .

		This made her desperate , and she very nearly let herself go .

		Like the
Abbesse de Jouarre	ORGANIZATION	, she wanted to get all there was out of life before the end came .

		She wa.s indiscreet enough to visit her lover in his lodgings , and had just decided to run away with him , when
John	PERSON	took a hand in the affair , had a brief but lK -RRB- inted interview with the military gentleman , and persuaded liim that he had better quit .

		Then it turned out that the physician liad been mistaken in his diagnosis , and that she was in no danger after all .

		This changed the whole face of matters .

		The lover would have been all very well for a year or two , but she concluded that John vrould wear better .

		He , being highly magnanimous , forgave her for the sinful intention , and we are expected to believe in a happy future for the two .

		This story , weighted with much futile philosophizing , is not exactly edifying , and its dulness is relieved by few flashes of brilliancy .

		Another woman with a temperament is the heroine of '' The Wingless Victory , '' by Mr.
M. P. Willcocks	PERSON	.

		She lives on the
South Devon Coast	LOCATION	, and is the wife of the village physician .

		The husband is a rough diamond , and there was no sentiment in the marriage upon either side , the man having been impelled to it by the most prosaic considerations , and the woman by an experimental impulse .

		Not long thereafter , she turns the head of a youthful artist , native to those parts , and allows him to make callow love to her .

		When he is driven to supposed suicide , she takes the matter much to heart , and wonders what punishment fate has in store for her .

		Presently a child is born , becomes blind , and then dies of croup , which occur - rences seem to indicate that her imaginary sin has found its punishment .

		Meanwhile , an interesting situation has developed in the village over the ques - tion of water-supply -- - a situation which finds her husband nearly in the position of Dr.
Stockmann	PERSON	in '' An Enemy of the People . ''

		He is hounded out of position and practice , and his wife finds a hiding - place in Dartmoor .

		Here she poses as a maiden , and spreads her net for a young farmer , who is captured only to discover that he has been tricked by a married woman .

		Having carried this experi - ment to successful completion , the woman concludes that duty now calls her back to her husband , with whom , after some difficulty , she reassumes conjugal relations .

		The author seems to find some sort of justification for all this erratic conduct in the woman 's desire to live , to have experience , to realize herself ; but the reader of sane instincts will foUow her career with slight sympathy .

		The book has strength , however , although not in this plot with its dubious ethical implications .

		It is the strength of keen analysis , vivid descriptive power , and a characterization of the rustic population of
Devon	LOCATION	and Dartmoor fairly comparable with the work of Mr.
Phillpbtts	PERSON	and other disciples of the school of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	.

		In summing up our recollections of `` The
Country House	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, we are a little surprised at the contrast between the slightness of the story and the degree of interest which it has awakened .

		It concerns only the members of a small country family , with a few neighbors and visitors , only a few episodes of rather commonplace character .

		The only thing approaching the dramatic is the son and heir 's entanglement with the wife of a drunken reprobate , who has , iievertheless , sufficient self - respect to institute divorce proceedings when he learns of the intrigue , and decency enough to with - draw them when he realizes that the prosecution of his case would hurt other people besides the guilty pair .

		This same son and heir also goes in for horse-racing , and gets deep into debt as a conse - quence .

		He makes a pretty poor hero ; in fact , the story has neither hero nor heroine in the proper sense , and only a couple of characters with whom we have any sympathy whatever .

		Yet it is , as we have already suggested , an extremely interesting story , made so by the extraordinary precision of its characterization and literary phrasing .

		Few novelists are as successful as Mr.
Giilsworthy	PERSON	in adapting their means to their purposes , with the result , as in the present instance , of giving vivid reality to a group of commonplace people , and of reproducing the very atmosphere of the scenes in which they move .

		It was no very serious matter -- an indiscreet note , the gift of a trinket , and a stolen kiss -- but

Tony Palliser	PERSON	, heir to an English country estate , and betrothed to
Violet Wayne	PERSON	, was the culprit , and he was weak enough to let his poor kinsman .


Bernard Appleby	PERSON	, bear the blame .

		The girl with whose affections he had trifled was a gamekeeper 's daughter , and her father proceeded to blackmail Tony with considerable success .

		Finally .

		Bernard took a hand , interviewed the fellow , and knocked him down .

		The game - keeper , who was drunk at the time , picked himself up , then stumbled into the river and was drowned , , When his body was found the next day .

		bearing | marks of violence ,
Bernard	PERSON	promptly drew suspicion to himself by fleeing from the country .

		We are glad on the whole that he fled , for otherwise we should have missed the capital `` story which follows .

		Bernard finds his way to
Cuba	LOCATION	, becomes a leader of a band of insurgents , and is mixed up in many exciting skirmishes .

		Then a rich American who has befriended him puts him in charge of a sug ^ - plantation in the disaffected district .

		When news comes of the
Maine	LOCATION	disaster , he concludes that the psychological moment has arrived , and he saves his employer 's interests by boldly coming out on the side of the insurgents .

		Jleanwhile .

		his employer 's daughter , who has gone to
England	LOCATION	, finds herself among the scenes from which
Bernard	PERSON	has fled .

		She causes the truth to transpire , and the wretched Tony , convicted of cowardice , starts for
Cuba	LOCATION	to see if he can make reparation .

		He makes it by saving
Bernard	PERSON	's life , and at the same time conveniently dies in a skirmish .

		Tliis leaves the field clear for
Bernard	PERSON	, who presently goes back to
England	LOCATION	, renews his actjuaintance witli Violet whom he has loved in secret all the time , and receives the pledge of her affection .

		This is the bare outline of a story which is rich in dramatic interest , and which ex - hibits remarkable powers of characterization and description .

		It is the work of ^ Ir .


Harold Bindloss	PERSON	.

		and is called '' The Dust of Conflict , '' The historical romance of classical times is apt to be an unsatisfactorj ' performance .

		The Crermans have been its chief practitioners , but have rarely succeeded in giv-ing dramatic cogencj ' to their pro- ductions , or to their characters the breath of life .

		Bulwer and
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	probably came as neai - to success as is possible for a modern novelist , for the difficulties of the task are well-nigh insuperable .

		Either the story will be so stiffened by archaeologj - as to present but the semblance of living action , or the treatment will be so frankly romantic as to destroy all verisimilitude .

		Mr.
William	PERSON	.


Stearns Davis	PERSON	, in • • A
Victor	PERSON	of Salamis , '' has been measur - ably successful in steering between this
Scylla	LOCATION	and this
Charybdis	LOCATION	, and it is possible to read his book with a certain degree of interest , although he has to rely largely upon the adventitious aid of those consecrated associations which make the heart leap at the verj - names of
Thermopylae	LOCATION	and Salamis and
Plataea	LOCATION	.

		These memorable struggles are his theme , and his list of characters includes
Leonidas	PERSON	and Themistocles .

		Mardonius and the
Great King	ORGANIZATION	.

		The I battle scenes are described with vivid particularity , and the private interest of the narrative is provided by the fortunes of one
Glaucon	PERSON	.

		an Athenian , falsely accused of medizing , driven into exile with the Persians , and returning at a critical moment to assist in the final repulse of the barbarian invader and bring discomfiture to his personal enemies .

		Knowledge and deep sympathy combine to make the book something more than readable , which is perhaps all that was to be expected of it .

		`` Beatrix of Clare , '' by Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, is tite latest example -- and a glaring one -- of Wardour Street fiction .

		It is a romance of
Richard III.	PERSON	, representing that maligned monarch as a noble character , albeit astute enough to fall in with the conditions of fifteenth century political morality .

		The story b ^ ^ shortly before the mur - der of the princes in the Tower -LRB- of which crime
Richard	PERSON	is held guiltless -RRB- , and ends just before the invasion of
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		In manner and sentiment it is poor stuff , and about as unreal as possible .

		The knightly hero and the proud heroine are tricked out with the usual attributes of such lay figures , and the course of their love has to conquer the usual impediments before they are finally united .


Squire Warden	ORGANIZATION	is the leading citizen of a small
New England Town	LOCATION	.

		He is something of a skin - flint , and his wealth has been acquired by various forms of sharp practice .

		In one case , many years before we become acquainted with him , cupidity had made him a criminal , for he had forged a wnll to his own benefit .

		Retribution is long delayed , but i-omes at last with the visit to his house one night of a piratical sea-farer , who brings with him a little girL This picturesque old ruffian is the person whom the f org ^ wfll has dispossessed , and the little girl is his child .

		By a combination of moral suasion with physical violence he persuades the
Squire	LOCATION	to adopt the child and pay a substantial sum of hush - money to her father .

		Several years then elapse , and the girl grows up to be an attractive young woman .

		Then the pirate reappears , settles down in the village , and proceeds to bleed the
Squire	LOCATION	at frequent intervals .

		His operations are conducted with a fine sense of humor , and we sj-mpathize with them to a certain degree , especially when we dis - cover that the money he wrings from his unwilling ^ ` ictuu is - being hoarded for the benefit of his daughter .

		Then the
Squire	PERSON	, who owns a mill , has trouble with his men , and his tormentor takes parti - cular delight in forcing him to make concessions to the fanatical agitator who has fomented the disturb - ance .

		The heroine , who is sought after by this very objectionable young man .

		is almost persuaded to become his wife in order to appease her guardian , now driven frantic by the dread of exposure .

		But she is saved from this fate by the intervention of an artist-lover , who bears her triumphantly away .

		These are the chief ingredients of a storj - wliic.h , despite its fantastic character , sustains our interest to the end .

		It is called '' The Upper Hand , '' and is the work of Mr.
Emerson Gifford Tavlor	PERSON	.

		64 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
August 1	DATE	, The New Villain of American fiction , as we all know , is not the primitive creature who used to be the foil of virtue , and whose vulgar crimes we so willingly abhorred .

		His place is now usurped by the industrial magnate whose instruments of crime are political corruption , and the exploitation of the masses , and the crushing of the weak com - petitor .

		He has his nemesis , as a rule , not in the shape of unmasking and outward disgrace , but in the sting of a tardily-awakened conscience , or an uneasy realization that his success has not been worth its cost .

		The favorite form of treatment is to represent him as a loving husband or parent , woimded in his tenderest susceptibilities by the wife or children whose eyes become opened to the sources of his wealth , and whose condemnation , silent or expressed , is to him the most terrible of punishments .

		A typical example of this new-fashioned treatment of an old theme is given us in '' The Giant 's Strength , '' by Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	.


Paul Trafford	PERSON	, who is the richest man in
America	LOCATION	, is the giant , and his strength is tyrannously used for the purpose of driving his rivals to the wall .

		Discomfiture comes when his daughter falls in love with the son of one of those defeated rivals , and grows estranged from her father when she learns by what means he has acquired his fortune .

		The conclusion of the whole matter is touchingly sentimental , but not , we fear , altogether probable , for the chastened magnate undergoes a change of heart , becomes reconciled to his foes , both of the household and the mart , and we leave him bestowing his blessing upon the lovers and seek - ing to repair as far as possible the mischief he has done .

		The contrasted ideals of civic and political moral - ity held , respectively , by the older and the younger generation , are once more presented to our view in '' By Right Divine , '' Mr.
William Sage	PERSON	's latest invention .

		The older generation is represented by
Senator Fordyce of Keenville	ORGANIZATION	, who has long held his State -LRB- politically -RRB- in the hollow of his band , having for his allies a choice assortment of leading citizens .


Francis Thayer	PERSON	, elected Governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	at the age of thirty-five , represents the younger generation , and it becomes his task to unmask the Senator and defeat the nefarious schemes of the cor - rupt political ring .

		Having outlined so much of the situation , we are almost ashamed to waste further space by adding that the Senator has a daughter , who is devoted to her father , but who is forced to condemn him when his iniquities are exposed .

		Mr.
Sage	PERSON	handles this stock situation skilfully , and gives his story a certain freshness by various accessory devices .

		The plot contrived for the hero 's undoing is too flimsy to gain much credence , and it must have been a very
guUible Senate	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- we forgot to mention that the Governor had been translated to
Washington	LOCATION	as his enemy 's colleague -RRB- that voted to unseat him upon the evidence offered .

		At the critical moment , the arch-offender comes to the scratcli , confides his guilt to an astonished
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and takes his leave of politics forever .

		We refrain from insulting the intelligence of our readers by telling them what be - comes of his daughter .

		Miss
Marjorie Bowen	PERSON	is a young woman who will bear watching .

		Her first novel , '' The Viper of
Milan	LOCATION	, '' was rather preposterous , and nothing but the extreme youth of the writer could justify the praise which it got in certain interested quarters .

		Her second novel , '' The Master of Stair , '' is so much more creditable a work that its merits are in no need of puffery .

		The breeziness with which it handles a disputed historical situation is a passport to our favor , although hardly suggestive of the critical temper .

		Its subject is the massacre of
Gleucoe	LOCATION	, and the
Master of Stair	ORGANIZATION	is the arch-villain of the tragedy .

		As for the
King	ORGANIZATION	, he stands acquitted of anything worse than thoughtlessness in signing an order the purport of which is concealed from him , and his one appearance in the narrative is very cleverly managed .

		Miss
Bowen	PERSON	has an amiable way of despatching her characters when they have served their purpose , a practice to be commended , because it greatly simplifies the cleai-ing-up process of the closing chapter .

		There seems to be no subject of scientific con - jectm ' e that the novelist may not , sooner or later , find fitted to his purpose .

		This eagerness to exploit the latest thing in thought or discovery shows how hard-pressed the writer of fiction is becoming under the stress of the popular demand for more , and still more , novels .

		It is not altogether a wholesome tendency , since the old material is good enough for the writer who knows how to use it , and the new material is often of questionable value for the uses of fiction .

		The subject of dual personality is just now in the air ; it is a subject of which science itself knows next to nothing as yet .

		But this fact offers no obstacle to the novelty-seeking story-teller ; rather does it encourage him in his determination to dis - course of all things on earth and in heaven , with small regard for anything but picturesque or imagi - native effect .

		We have read three novels of dual personality within the past twelvemonth ; two of them were trifling affairs designed to be amusing and nothing more , but the third is the work of a serious wTiter whose talents we regi'et to see wasted upon so unprofitable a theme .

		It is entitled '' The Invader , '' and is written by Mrs.
Margaret L. Woods	PERSON	.

		The heroine is a young woman , a student struggling for honors at an
Oxford College	ORGANIZATION	, who has the unpleasant habit of falling into a long sleep every few months , and awakening with a different character and a different set of memories .

		This is particularly embarrassing to the don whom she mar - ries , because he is in love with one of her alternating characters and indifferent toward the other .

		More - over , such is the perversity of man , it is the frivolous and reckless Mildred whom he loves , and not the clinging and conscientious
Milly	PERSON	.

		When the young woman awakes in the former character , she makes things particularly lively for her entourage , and when she becomes MUly once more , she suffers from the consequences of Mildred 's pranks .

		■ which seems to be that which is normally hers , she conceives a horror of the other creature who invades her peaceful domestic existence , and when she finds out that her husband prefers Mfldred to herself , she puts an end to her rival 's existence by drowning the tenement common to them both .

		The interest of this fantastic tale is but moderate , which is chiefly due to the fact that the author takes her subject over-seriously .

		instead of frankly abandoning herself to its possibilities of comedy and dramatic effect . '

FrSnlein Schmidt	PERSON	and Mr.
Anstmther	PERSON	'' is a story told wholly in letters .

		Moreover , the letters are all written by one person , to wit .

		.


Fraulein Rose	PERSON	-
Marie Schmidt	PERSON	, of
Jena	PERSON	, the daughter of an impe - cunious scholar who writes unsalable books , and who occasionally takes young Englishmen into the family to teach them German .

		One of these guests is
Roger Anstruther	PERSON	.

		who , when the storj - opens , has just left for
England	LOCATION	after making violent love to
Rose-Marie	PERSON	, and contracting a secret engagement with her .

		It is in her letters to him that the story is unfolded : from them we learn how his love grows chill after a week or so .

		how he becomes engaged to an English heiress , about whom he writes in great detail to
Rose-Marie	PERSON	, how he fares in various ways during the foUowring year -LRB- for he keejjs on writing and she keeps on replying -RRB- , how eventually the heiress takes umbrage at his voluminous Gennan correspondence and transfers her allegiance to a convenient duke , and how
Roger	PERSON	then pleads in vain to be taken back into the affections of
Rose-Marie	PERSON	.

		It is not very much of a story , but that does n't greatly matter , because it is Rose-Marie who really interests us all the while , and because her letters are the most delightful compound of bourgeois realism , sentimental fancy , and delicate humor .

		In one aspect , the book gives us the annals of a new
Buchholz	PERSON	family ; in another , it pictures a charming individuality .

		It is quite evident that
Roger	PERSON	made a bad mistake when he let
Rose-Marie	PERSON	slip from his grasp .

		Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	's intimate studies of the ''
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania Dutch '' have again borne fruit in a story marked by unusual powers of penetrating observa - tion .

		It is , moreover , a story of considerable human interest in the wider sense , although we find it some - what difficult to accept the extraordinary heroine .

		This young woman is of gentle extraction , but she has been abandoned in her infancy , and has fallen into the hands of a thrifty and illiterate German farmer , in whose family she grows up as the house - hold drudge .

		To all outward seeming the embod - iment of stolidity , she has , nevertheless , by the aid of a library of good literature left by her parents and stowed away in an unoccupied corner of the farmhouse , made herself a woman of refined culture in the best sense , although childishly ignorant of the actual world of cultivation .

		When the farmer opens his doors to take in
summer	DATE	boarders , her opportunity appears , for among these boarders is the young professor of psychologj ' in a neighboring university .

		He discovers the young woman 's true character , and at the same time discovers documents which make her an heiress .

		For all this , she could do no less than love him , and the conventional romantic out - come ensues .

		A vein of charming comedy is supplied by the appearance , among the
summer	DATE	boarders , of the university president 's daughter , a soulful creature for whom life is one protracted pose .

		During her stay , the professor protects himself by assuming the disguise of a farm hand , maintaining the deception far beyond any probable limits .

		Her endeaTors to arouse his slnggish faculties to some conception of the higher life makes very diverting reading .


Judith Harriman	PERSON	is the heiress of a French estate amounting to twenty million francs , of which she may take possession at any moment by presenting her claim .

		This she refuses to do , for some imex - plained reason , and comes to
America	LOCATION	to earn her living .

		This causes despair to her mother , who is living in poverty in
Paris	LOCATION	, and also to the
Duke de Montr	ORGANIZATION	^ sor , who has ardently wooed her charms and her millions .

		When her story begins for us , she is occupied in giving parlor-talks and recitations at a summer-school of soulful philosophers somewhere in
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		Here she meets the popular novelist and poet ,
Sidney Conningsby	PERSON	.

		who promptly suc - cumbs to her fascination .

		After an episode in which she is kidnapped by the duke , chloroformed , impris - oned in a
New York	LOCATION	hotel , and m ^ es her escape , she returns to the
summer	DATE	colony , presently marries the poet , and goes away with him to spend a year on the Isthmus , where be is to write Ids great novel .

		The year elapses , and they return with a manuscript and a ehOd .

		The manuscript is rejected -LRB- for some - how the novelist seems to have lost his grip -RRB- and the child dies .

		Povertv ' overtakes the couple , and the husband is unfaithful to the wife , who leaves him .

		and becomes the '' social secretary '' of the real hero of the book , a man of ample cardiac and muscular development , who has cherished the memorj ' of a casual meeting with her in
France	LOCATION	years before .

		Then the faithless husband starts to run away with the new object of his affections .

		Their vehicle collides with a trolley-car .

		and
Conningsby	ORGANIZATION	is fatally injured .

		Then
Judith	PERSON	takes possession of his para - mour , carries her away to
Paris	LOCATION	, claims the millions , divides them between her rivaL her mother , and an amiable clergyman devoted to charitable works , and returns to
America	LOCATION	penniless .

		The death of her husband has left her free to marry the man who has loved her all the time , and she yields grace - fully to the inevitable .

		It will be seen from this s \ - nop8is that
Judith	PERSON	's story is abundantly supplied with exciting incident : this is about all that may possiUy be said in its favor , for it is both imreal in characterization and preposterous in invention .

		Among the
James	PERSON	- town books , Mrs.
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	's '' The Birth of the Nation '' -LRB- Macniillan -RRB- is easily the best .

		Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	has already made interesting contributions to history in '' The Mother of
Washington	LOCATION	and Her Times '' and '' Reminiscences of Peace and War , '' both of which are more serious efforts than the present volume .

		In the work under review , Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	aims simply to give a readable sketch of the early attempts at colonization by the English , with special attention to the
Jamestown	LOCATION	settlement and the work of Captain
John Smith	PERSON	.

		It is based upon all the available sources , and these have been fairly well used .

		There is no offensive display of the critical spirit ; neither is the author credulous .

		Her attitude toward the traditions may be illustrated by her comment on
John Smith	PERSON	: ' - He has been accused of coloring his narratives too highly ; indeed , of inventing some of them .

		For myself , I admire him too much to concede more than the cum grano salts with which , also , we daily and hourly season much that we hear . ''

		Some of
John Smith	ORGANIZATION	's fabri - cations are forgiven as having been based on the prin - ciple enunciated by the Sunday-school boy : '' A lie is an abomination unto the Lord and a very present help in time of trouble . ''

		The reader is '' thankful to Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	for exhibiting the humorous side of things .

		Even the temperance people can not prevent us from feeling amused at the first Indian who met his '' greefe '' through '' hot drinks , liut was all right next morning '' ; and what a country it was where much land could be purchased for '' two great guns and a grindstone '' !

		and what a man was the redoubtable
John Smith	PERSON	, for whom a gallows was erected , but who '' could not be pre - vailed on to use it '' I In the way of criticism , it may be said that the author seems to think that Powhatan is a name , not a title ; that too much space is devoted to descriptions of the Indians and their life , and not enough attention to conditions among the colonists ; that there is no index , and some of the illustrations would be better suited to a work of fiction .

		The reviewer would also like tremblingly to object to the statement of the \ ` irginia lady that a '' hoe-cake '' is now cooked before the fire ; that method is of the past .

		Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	speaks a good word for the too numerous gentlemen who first came to the new world ; and her estimate of the
Jamestown	LOCATION	colony is worth quoting : * ' The minia - ture republic -- for such it rapidly grew to l -RRB- e in nearly everything except in name -- held within its borders just the elements that distinguish the great republic of to-day : some noble spirits with high aims and fervent patriotism ; some sordid souls intent alone on gain ; some unprincipled , desperate char - acters ; others simply useless , idle and ignoble . ''

		JVative stories ^ ' ^ ^ manifest that a unique people of Japanese life can best be understood from its own anucharacter .

		literature .

		A first-rate translation , giving the substance and color of the actual thought of an insular nation like the Japanese , is worth a wagon-load of the impressions of aliens .

		We have in two books by Dr.
Walter Dening	PERSON	, issued by the
Methodist Publishing House of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, such a mirror of life .

		These two works ought to be in every public library .

		One is entitletl ''
Japan	LOCATION	in Days of Yore , '' in which are ten good stories , mostly of the Yedo period of
Japan	LOCATION	's history , with six appendices containing storiettes , essays , de - scriptions , and anecdotes , which richly supplement the main narratives .

		The second volume , historical and critical in its character , is entitled '' A Xew Life of
Toyotomi Hideyoshi	PERSON	, '' and is a revised and much improved edition of the author 's work pub - lished in
1888	DATE	.

		Dr.
Dening	PERSON	, the translator , has lived nuich of his adult life-time in
Japan	LOCATION	, and his knowledge of the language and literature is profound and exact .

		His English is limpid , flowing , and well reproduces the original .

		Almost the only criticism to be made is upon his two-frequent use of allusions , references , and '' modern instances , '' which detract from rather than add to the value of his work .

		Nevertheless , it may safely be said that since
Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's '' Tales of Old
Japan	LOCATION	'' there has been nothing of the sort quite so useful and entertaining as these stories of actual .

		Japanese life , with its lights and shadows , its curious customs , its odd and quaint phenomena of emotion and ethics , which were pos - sible only in feudalism and on an island shut away from the rest of the world .

		The anecdotes of judicial procedure under the famous Oka , Echizen no Kami , who was a sort of Japanese Solomon , are particularly racy .

		He , too , certainly knew how to decide when two women claimed motherhood of the same infant .

		Mr.
Dening	PERSON	's foot-notes and explanations of such peculiarly Japanese institutions as hara-kiri , ju-jutsu , and phases of
Bushido	LOCATION	, are especially timely when even the average
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	is beginning to discover some of the reserves of power which do not appear on the surface , but explain why and how the Japanese succeed .

		Turning from native fiction to history , Mr.
Dening	PERSON	, having digested many books on his favorite theme , gives in his other work an animated narrar tive of a man who , like
Napoleon	PERSON	, was not physically imposing , yet who rose from the lowest stratum of society to be the unifier and dictator of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Hide - yoshi made his way through all obstacles , and even built a temple to his own honor , hoping that after his death he might be enrolled among the gods of his people .

		Although he failed in this , it is certain that in courage , originality , fertility of resource , knowledge of human nature , generosity , and versa - tility of mind ,
Hideyoshi	PERSON	had among his countrymen few equals and no superiors .

		Those who have read `` Ten Acres Po ` r ^ . ''

		* Enough '' and
Hubert	PERSON	's ''
Libertv	PERSON	- and a Living '' are likely to recall both those works on taking up '' Three Acres and Liberty , '' by Mr.
Bolton Hall	PERSON	: and , aside from the title , there are suggestions of both books in the contents -- not in any attempt at copying , but in the spirit that informs the writer .

		It will be seen that Mr.
Hall	PERSON	goes several steps farther than the author of the first-named book : and he is more enthusiastic than Mr.
Hubert	PERSON	, who is known to have given up his experiment at country living .

		The volume under consideration is not a text ` book in agriculture or horticulture , but rather a series of suggestive chap - ters as to what may be accomplished by those who are wearj - of the confinement of city life and are willing to work for their freedom .

		The author has been deeply moved by the help afforded needy men and women by means of the vacant city lots which they are allowed to use for gardens ; and he cites many examples , with facts and figures , to show what may be done with the smallest plot of ground , both in growing and in marketing produce .

		He lavs great stress on intensive culture , and includes a chapter descriptive of accessible places where cheap land may still be obtained , mentioning also what mav be grown there .

		Of course , not everything that prop - erly belongs in such a work could be included , yet one notes with some surprise the omission of any reference to the peach region of ilichigan .

		In fact , the author is not always sufBciently specific in re - gard to regions adapted to special products , probably assuming that those who are interested in the sub - ject will Investigate further .

		While , as has been said , the work is not a text-book , yet on some un - familiar topics there are quite full directions , -- as .

		for example , the construction of greenhouses , conducting a - violet farm , '' and prejjaring wild drug-plants for market .

		Other subjects treated are • • How to Buy the Farm . ''

		• • The Kitchen Garden . ''

		`` Tools and
Equipment	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Advantages of Capital . '' '

		• Fruits , '' '' Flowers . ' '' '

		■ Novel Live Stock , '' '' Clear - ing the Land , '' '' How to Build . ''

		While one chapter only is headed • • Results to be Expected , '' the author is so full of the subject that it crops out everywhere .

		The style is somewhat colloquial , perhaps inten - tionally so .

		There is an index , also an appendix containing a good list of practical reference Ikx ^ s and a vegetable-planting table .

		Thriifr-ttorv Almost half a centnry had passed of a famotu between the death of
Julie Lespinasse	PERSON	FY ^ hwoman .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pubUcation of that corre - spondence of hers with the
Conte de Guibert	ORGANIZATION	which made all
Paris	LOCATION	ring with the passionate love-story of this leader of eighteenth cenrurj ' salons , a story so entirely unsuspected during her lifetime that even d'Alembert , her dearest friend and constant com - ^ panion , accused her of being entirely without heart and incapable of love .

		The correspondence has become a part of the world 's famous literature , and has served as a basis for fiction in many tongues . '

		Only a few years ago , reviewers vied with one another for the credit of discovering .


Julie de Lespinasse	PERSON	in the heroine of ' * Lady Rose 's Daughter , '' and all those who had not yet made the acquaintance of the historical
Julie	PERSON	hastened to read the famous letters , which were far more fasci - nating than any novel written about them could ever hope to be .

		But there was much of mystery still : clinging to the noted Frenchwoman 's life ; the tragedy of her last years had little connection with the equally interesting and complex history of her youth .

		-- her long Platonic friendship for d'Alembert , her influence on
Condorcet	LOCATION	,
Turgot	LOCATION	,
Hume	PERSON	.

		Soard .

		Nor did the
Guibert	PERSON	letters more than hint at an earlier love-affair , quite as intense , as tragic , and as mysterious .

		The Marquis de S ^ ; ur , therefore , did a woric of interest to many when he searched the archives of all the great French families in any intimate way connected with
Julie de Lespinasse	PERSON	, and , having solved most of the riddles of her life , published a book detailing his discoveries .

		The volume is not entirely well constructed , but this is ; partly due to the necessity under which the author I labored of wiping out some mistaken but generally ' current theories of
Julie	PERSON	's birth and early life before he proceeded to his direct testimonj - .

		It would have been quite impossible to make a bald biography with such interesting material , and the ^ larquis de S ^ ^ has brought enough personal interest and en ^ n - siasm to his work to counteract largely his lack of constructive literary ability .

		The book has been I adequately tnutalated by
P. H. Lee Warner	PERSON	, and is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with an interesting photogravure portrait of the charming subject .

		^ ^ ^ volume entitled '' Indiscreet Let - I `` BoierHeae '' ters from Peking '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	PERSON	& in < M '' ai '' i900 .

		-LRB- ^ ^ ig ^ interesting and a puzzling i book .

		It purports to contain letters written from day to day by a member of one of the besieged European legations during the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising of I
1900	DATE	.

		But no one could have written journal - lettos of this kind under the conditions described : ' the identity of the writer is concealed , and no meaiK are given of substantiating the startling revelations contained in the narrative .

		The editor of the volume , Mr.
B. L. Putnam	PERSON	-
Weale.	LOCATION	, is known -LSB- as an intelligent writer on Oriental politics and i life , and the fact that he becomes in a measure I responsible for the contents of the letters seems to I give them something of historical value .

		Whoever i the writer is , he certainly has an eye for the pic - turesque and the striking , whatever may be said of the correctness of his vision in other ways .

		It would be hard to find a more depressing revelation of incapacity , indecision , cowardice , and selfishness 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, than is here given in the account of the terrible times tlirough which the besieged legations passed ; and the writer does not hesitate even to call the names of the diplomats and nationalities of the men and women who showed these unlovely qualities .

		A few stand out as real men , -- a Japanese colonel , an American missionary , a German ambassador ; but in the tierce trial most of those whose training ought to have made them strong failed to stand the test .

		The reader can not help feeling that the narrative is colored , that the real facts can not have been quite 80 lurid or the characters of the men and women quite 80 mean as they are here portrayed .

		But after all deductions are made , the story here given , of the Warning , the Siege , and the Sack , is remarkably interesting , even though it is full of horrors , largely through the remarkable power of the writer to make his cliaracters and events live in his pages .

		Theaeveiopment ^ ^ pointed out by Mr.
Otto Walter	PERSON	of photography
Beck	PERSON	, in his '' Art Principles in Por - at a free art .

		^ rait Photography '' -LRB-
The Baker & Taylor Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the processes inherited from Daguerre remain practically unchanged to-day , and their results are known popularly as '' good straight photogi'aphy . ''

		Mr.
Beck	PERSON	asserts that this plain photography , enslaved by commercialism , has run into a lifeless groove .

		Its direct result has been to instil a taste for literalism chilling in its effect upon every form of art . ''

		Art in photography is possible only in an extension of the methods known and in the employment of new processes to effect a mani - pulation of the photo-image .

		When the tool is made so pliable that it records more than the surface appearance of things , when the personal element enters to give life to the accurate records , the pre - sent limitations of impersonal representation are removed from photography , and its large true sphere of influence opens . ''

		In the treatise before us , Mr.
Beck	PERSON	has shown , by description and pictorial illustration , that if creative work is to enter into photography it must be possible to make on the negative a line of any character and to control the light and shade with the facility of one who paints .

		In fact , his illustrations show that those powerful resources of the graphic arts , light lines and dark lines , can be made on the negative as readily as on paper and canvas .

		It is interesting to follow the divagations of this enthusiastic artist , as he pro- pounds the principles and processes that wiU remove photography from its limited conventionalities and place it among the free arts .

		The book is worthy of perusal by amateur as well as professional photo - graphers .

California	LOCATION	, it may seem strange that a special book should be needed for the would-be gardener in that state .

		But so peculiar is the climate , which is widely varied even within the state limits , and the soil , often of several kinds and depths on a single ranch , that such a work is essential .

		The well-known volumes on
California	LOCATION	fruits and vegetables , by Professor
Wickson	PERSON	, have now been followed by one on flowers and orna - mental gardening , by Mrs.
Belle Sumner Angier	PERSON	. ''

		The Garden Book of
California	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tells many things that the new-comer to
California	LOCATION	, if interested in gardening , will wish to know .

		It presupposes a knowledge of gardening in general , and emphasizes those points wherein garden operations and conditions on the coast vai-y from those existing elsewhere .

		The introductory chapter , however , on the flower-garden as a factor in home-making and child-training , is applicable to any region .

		Following this are chapters on simple gardening methods , a planting calendar , the culture of common plants and bulbs , palms and tropical plants , rose-culture in
California	LOCATION	, ferns and fern - eries , the mission of the vine , boundaries , tree - planting and protection , insecticides and plant diseases , backyard problems , out-of-door living rooms , the equipment of the aviary , and native trees , flowers , and shrubs .

		The last chapter is necessarily incomplete , and shoidd be supplemented by reference to a book on the wild-flowers of the coast ; but it is pleasantly suggestive .

		The book contains twenty illustrations from photographs , showing numerous typical
California	LOCATION	scenes , such as the palm and the pine as neighbors , a marguerite hedge , a rose-bower , an avenue of
Eucalypti	LOCATION	, and charming residences in the Mission style of archi - tecture with appropriate garden surroundings .

		• the early
Chris	PERSON	- Church , a Chapter in the History of tian martyri .

		Renunciation '' -LRB-
Jennings & Graham	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Herbert B. Workman	PERSON	,
Principal of Westminster School	ORGANIZATION	, has set before his readers in a new light the relations of Christianity to the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	in the first three centuries of the Christian era , and has shown that the persecutions of those times were due not so much to a deep-seated intolerance of the new religion on the part of the Romans as to the lack of wisdom for tempering the zeal of the Christians .

		Regarding self-sacrifice as the highest recognized principle of the kingdom of God , and looking upon martyrdom as the highest expression of that prin - ciple , the early Christians sought it , rather than escape from it .

		To participate in the sufferings of the Master was an assm-ance of participation in his glory .

		And instead of making their position in re - gard to the kingdoms of this earth clearly understood by the Roman authorities , they , consciously or other - wise , put themselves in the category of those who were disloyal , law-breakers , guilty of l & sh majeste , atheists , anarchists , outlaws , and non-conformists to the orderly regulations of the Roman Empire ; and they chose to suffer the consequences that must in - evitably arise .

		The Cliristians were , furthermore , unfortunate in retaining many superstitions , beliefs in demons and other supernatural agencies , which rendered them liable to penalties imposed by Roman law upon the practice of the magical arts .

		Mr.
Workman	PERSON	's book is a valuable contribution to the

		presents a critical study of the socialistic theory in its most rigid form .

		The doctrines of the English Classical School -- the corner-stone , as it were , upon which socialism was built -- are examined and their inconsistences noted .

		A student of socialistic theories as well as an astute observer of facts .

		Mr.
Le Rossingnal	PERSON	perceives the fallacies of socialism and flagrantly exposes them .

		He shows how the basic principle of Marxian philo - sophy -- the economic interpretation of history -- ci-umbles away under
Marx	PERSON	's assertion that there will be an • ' era of perfect peace . ''

		Furthermore , he sees slight ground for predicting that this social - istic era -- economically disastrous , as he believes -- wiU ever be realized .

		Mr.
Le Rossingnal	PERSON	makes his points skilfully , but one must bear in mind tliat in his small volume he in no way attempts to consider the -RSB- X -RRB- sition of the '' opportunists , '' a large sect of less radical socialists .

		In his pertinent discussion of '' or - thodox '' socialism , however , he is convincing in his conclusion that it is as yet '' but a faith , not a science .

		NOTES 97 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 98 THE UNIVERSITY IDEAL .

		The former president of an American uni - versity , speaking
last June	DATE	at eommenoement exercises which he had been inritetl to adorn with his
oratorj %	PERCENT	delivered himself of the fol - lowing message to his student audience : '' Keep step with the procession .

		It is a pretty good crowd , and it is generally moving in the right direction .

		Act with a party ; veil for a ticket ; whoop it up for the The advice is hardly necessary for the average college student , who is only too apt to regulate his life by philistine standards .

		But it offers cause for melanchol -RCB- - contemplation when we ctntiust it with the kind of advice that used to be offered upon such academic occasions .

		We have lieen calleil upon of late years to witness the replacement of the old-time clerical univer - sity president by the president versed in prac - tical affairs , and have been expected to applaud the change as a sign of progress .

		Progress in some directions it doubtless does indicate , -- in the management and enlargment of endowments , in the efficiency of administrative machinery , and in the creation of a general impression of bustling prosperity .

		But it is a prepress that may be dearly purchased at the price of dignity , or of a weakened consecration to the id `` ds of which a university should be the visible embodi - ment .

		It is a prt ^ ^ ress that may mean , indeed , nothing less than a parting of the ways .

		For what can there be in common between the sen - timent of the modem vulgarian , as expressed in his '' whoop it up for the flag , '' and the sen - timent that clings about the ''
Veritas	ORGANIZATION	' * of Har - vard and the '' Dominus Dluminatio Mea '' ' of Oxford ?

		Reverence for truth , concern for the things of the spirit , -- these are musty old ideals that have had their day .

		Keeping step with the procession is evidently the counsel of practical wisdom , concerned with the importance of being a good fellow , of letting well enoxigh alone , of substituting realities for dreams , -- all with the object of getting through life comfortably .

		We are far beyond the foolish notion of the Shorter Catechism respec-ting the chief end of man .

		It is clear as daylight that his chief end is to make his '' pile . ''

		and enjoy it afterwards with what 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, remains to him of eapatdty for enjoyment .

		An Irish moralist much in vogue just at present assures us that the man who should lose the whole world to gain his own soul woxdd make an astonishingly bad bargain ; and the opinion receives delighted acclaim .

		Institutions , no less than individuals , are moulded by the pressure of current opinion ; and it is not surprising that even universities shovdd now and then hearken to the counsels of a base opportunism .

		Yet there is an older ideal of university influence that it would be well not to forget , even when our intellectual life seems most at the point of suffocation in the welter of present day materialism .

		It is the ideal formulated in severely simple speech by
Newman	PERSON	when he says : '' A university training is the great ordinary means to a great but ordinary end ; it aims at raising the intel - lectual tone of society , at cidtivating the public mind , at purifying the national taste , at supplying true prin - ciples to popular enthusiasm and fixed aims to popular aspiration , at giving enlargement and sobriety to the ideas of the age , at facilitating the exercise of political power , and refining the intercourse of private life . ''

		It is the ideal embodied in the glowing eloquence of
Arnold	LOCATION	's apostrophe to Oxford : '' Adorable dreamer , whose heart has been so romantic !

		Who hast pven thyself so prodigally , given thyself to ideas and to heroes not mine , only never to the
Philis	LOCATION	- tines !

		home of lost causes , and forsaken beliefs , and unpopular names , and impossible loyalties !

		... Appar - itions of a day , what is our puny warfare against the
Philistines	LOCATION	, compared with the warfare which this queen of romance has been waging against them for centuries , and will wage after we are gone . ''

		The advisability of yelling for a ticket , and of whooping it up for the flag is , strangely enough , not even hinted at in these expressions of old fogyism ; nor is there any suggestion that in keeping step with the procession is the sum of practical wisdom .

		Such counsels may win the cheap applause of a pack of thoughtless under - graduates , but to the serious mind they are of melancholy omen .

		The temper that is the product of
University	ORGANIZATION	discipline should , to prove itself worth what it has cost , repudiate the very thought of a life controlled by impulse and swayed by partisan prejudice .

		These are the forces that have caused nearly all the mischief recorded in the annals of human history , and the trained intelligence is under bonds to oppose a solid front to their men - acing array .

		And so far from its being proper for the educated man to keep step ynth the pro- cession , it is his most solemn duty to get well in axivance of it , and to keep step only with those who know what the goal of that procession should be .

		His course should be that desci-ibed with a fine sense of responsibility in one of Ibsen 's letters : '' I maintain that a tighter in the intellectual vanguard caji never collect a majority round him .

		In ten years the majority will , possibly , occupy the standpoint which Dr.
Stockmann	ORGANIZATION	held at the public meetuig .

		But during these ten years the Doctor will not have been standing still ; he will stiU be at least ten years ahead of the majority .

		As regards myself , at least , I am conscious of mcessant progression .

		At the point where I stood when I wrote each of my books , there now stands a tolerably compact crowd ; but I myself am no longer there ; I am elsewhere ; farther ahead , I hope . ''

		For the educated man to keep step with the procession is for him to abdicate his well-earned leadership , to annul the patent of his rank in the aristocracy of intellect .

		This aristocracy rules indeed by divine right .

		All others are artificial creations , protected by mercenaiy cohorts , and embodying the selfish interests of class .

		This alone , by the very prin - ciple of its establishment , by the cachet of its honorable distinction , exists for the good of humanity , and its titles are secured by an indefeasible claim .

		Nature , no doubt , does most to determine what persons shall be the proud possessors of these titles ; but it is the university -LRB- taken as type of all the organized instrumentalities of culture -RRB- which searches out the individuals whom nature has thus marked , and transforms mute inglorious Miltons into vocal personalities of
reno %	PERCENT	vn .

		And once ap - proved of this aristocracy , as
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	reminds us , a man may never become an outcast save by his own faidt .

		It is an aristocracy in which responsibility goes hand in hand with privilege , and which values the latter chiefly because it entails acceptance of the former , and thereby makes for the service of mankind .

		The university , in its function as thtis con - ceived , does not attempt to '' whoop it up '' for any cause whatever .

		Not by vociferation , but by the refined method of the persuasive reason , are its ends attained .

		It stands aloof from the turmoil of the market-place and the contention of the arena , not indeed without sympathy , but certainly without noisy participation , content that its sane and reconciling influence should promise to prove effective upon the far-reaching future .

		Other agencies for the elevation of thought and conduct may lose their hold upon men and lapse into desuetude ; but the univer - sity , precisely because it is universal in its nature no less than in its name , takmg all knowledge and all life for its province , must persevere in its beneficent leadership .

		This obligation is
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 81 brought home to us here in
America	LOCATION	by the words of the editor of '' The Hibbert Journal , '' who recently paid us a \ ` isit .

		He said : '' I have been greatly struck with the interest shown in the higher ethical and religious aspect of things by the men who are responsible for the teaching in your universities -- I mean , of course , men who are not pro- fessionally engaged in the service of religion .

		I believe this will have a profound effect on the young men who pass through these colleges .

		I may be wrong , but it seems to me that the moral guidance of the nation is com - ing rather from the universities than from the churches as such . ''

		There is much to justify this prediction in our present-day university acti ^ - it ^ - .

		But it must be vmderstood that the moral guidance in question wtU not be commensurate with , or very definitely related to , the showing we make in material equipment , in imijosing educational statistics , and in the midtiplication of special schools of science .

		It will be measured in terms of quality rather than of quantity '' , and the spirit in which our universities meet the demand upon them will provide the real test whereby we may know whether they are concerned with substance rather than with shadow , with the core of intel - lectual endeavor rather than with its outward trappings .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The EVOLiTiox of the card catalogue , now so generally used in libraries and in many other institutions as well , is not so drearily uninterest - ing as might at first be expected .

		It has pre - sented some curious phases since the day , long ago .

		before the French Revolution , when a certain abb ^ conceived the germinal idea and set about index - ing his libi-ary by writing the titles on playing - cards , one tide to a card , and placing the cards on end in alphabetical order in a little tray .

		From this sanctified use of '' the devil 's picture-book , '' Mr.
Seth Hastings Grant	PERSON	, librarian of the
New York Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	in the middle of
last century	DATE	, advanced to the application of the card-index system to the record of books loaned ; and from that , later , when he became comptroller of
New York	LOCATION	, to its emplojtuent for business purposes , whereby he detected certain frauds practised by some of his subordinates .

		Thereby Mr.
Grant	PERSON	attained a sort of national renown , and the commercial card-index rose rapidly to its present prominence .

		The latest development is a card catalogue for the blind , now nearing completion -LRB- which is a contradiction in terms , as a card catalogue of a growing collection of books is never complete -RRB- in the department for the blind in the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cards , which are larger than the ordinary index cards , are inscribed by pricking the entry by the point sys - tem , both authors and subjects l > eing indexed .

		The drawers hold these pricked cards in an inverted position , so that by running the finger-tips over the backs of the cards a blind person may readily de - cipher the inscriptions .

		More than three thousand volumes , printed for the blind , and on the library 's shelves , are thus made conveniently available with little aid from attendants .

		Cape Ax > f in histoey and liteeatitbe has an importance and an interest that receive partial recog - nition in the remarkable monument dedicated this month at
Gloucester	LOCATION	.

		Everj ` one knows about the
Reef of Norman	ORGANIZATION	's Woe and the legendary wreck of the ' '' Hesperus '' -LRB- although the
Gloucester	LOCATION	fisherfolk stoutly aver their belief that there '' never was no such '' a vessel -RRB- immortalized by

		But perhaps not everybody has heard or read of the first settlement of

Boston	LOCATION	had its beginnings , and its re-settlement about ten years later under the fostering care of the ' Rev.
John `` White	PERSON	, of
Dorchester	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		It is to perpetuate the memory of this founder of what is sometimes called '' the birthplace of the
Massachu	PERSON	- setts Bay Colony '' that a monster boulder , two hun - dred feet long and twenty-seven feet high , has been selected to bear the memorial tablet , sixteen feet by thirteen , with its sculptured enclosure in bas-relief , -- the largest bronze , it is said , ever placed in this country .

		According to the programme drawn up for the day 's festivities .

		Senator Lodge delivers the oration and Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	recites the poem -- about the time that President
Roosevelt	PERSON	and Mr.

		The artistic part of this undertaking has been in charge of Mr.
Eric Pape	PERSON	, who is reported to have entered grandly into the spirit of the occasion , as indeed became a citizen of the

Cape Ann	LOCATION	and its legends and history .

		• • • The exact meaxing of a curious Southern IDIOM , '' you all , '' and its first-person and third - person forms , is pretty well established by Professor
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, of
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, in tlie
July	DATE	'' Uncle Remus 's Magazine . ''

		Though '' ydu all '' -LRB- with accent on the you -RRB- is some - times used in addressing one person only , there is a distinct implication that this one person is repre - sentative of a group or class .

		`` You dU '' -LRB- accent on the all -RRB- , in both
South and North	LOCATION	, means the same as '' all of you . ''

		Furthermore ,
Professor Smith	ORGANIZATION	points out the adjective force of you in `` ydn ' • all , '' and the prominal part played by all ; whereas in `` you dll . ''

		the parts of speech are reversed .

		He also thinks he finds traces of this idiomatic use of • • ydu all '' • • in
Sliakespeare	LOCATION	, the
King James	LOCATION	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and elsewhere in classic English liter -
82	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, ature ; but here he is not altogether convincing .

		Brief reference is made to the conjectural derivation of the phrase from the French , vous tous , nous tous .

		More nearly correspondent in sense , it seems to us , is the French vous autres and nous autres , although even here the analogy is far from close .

		Inciden - tally the writer speaks of '' there being not the slightest difference in meaning or propriety between the alternative forms -LSB- ' you ^ 11 ' and ' all of you , ' ' we ^ 11 ' and ' all of us , ' ' they itll ' and ' all of them ' -RSB- . ''

		A stickler for verbal propriety might object that '' all of you , of us , of them '' is a false use of the partitive genitive ; there are purists who are severe in their condemnation of the phrase .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	has done a service in contributing toward a final settlement of a much - discussed question .

		... HoNOKs TO
Henley	LOCATION	, come somewhat tardily , but they have come at last in gratifyingly full measure .

		His bust , recently unveiled at
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's with impres - .

		sive dedicatory exercises , could not have been more fittingly placed than in the heart of the city whose manifold sights and sounds he celebrated in verse .

		Would that he might have had some foreglimpse of this loving tribute when from his bed of pain he was writing '' Out of the night that covers me , black as the pit from pole to pole ! ''

		The poet of the '' unconquerable soul , '' it will be remembered , dared to speak his mind a few years ago when the memory of
Stevenson	PERSON	was being deluged with tears of mawk - ish sentimentality ; and for this word of manly protest he had to face the finger of scorn and suffer the false charge of petty malice , of envy , and of ingratitude .

		But the last hiss is now hushed , and in
London	LOCATION	it is the prevalent fashion to style him the
Walt Whitman	PERSON	of English literature .

		In a letter read at the unveiling , Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	said of Henley : '' He had the poet 's passion for nature , and by reason of it the poet 's fervent devotion to humanity . ''

		Peculiarly fitting was it that his bust should be from the chisel of
Rodin	LOCATION	, another indom - itable independent , whom Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	has not hesitated to call '' the greatest plastic genius of our time . ''

		, , A DECREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR FICTION is , rather strangely , indicated in the last annual report of the
London	LOCATION	Library .

		By the
Borough Librarian of Holborn	ORGANIZATION	this further statement is given out to the press : '' There is no doubt that the craze for novel - reading is dying out .

		Ten years ago the percentage of books delivered to readers in the borough was 66.1 for works of fiction and 32.9 for historical , scientific , and other works .

		Last year the percentage stood at 56.5 for novels and 43.5 for other books .

		This shows conclusively , I think , that readers , so far at any rate as this district is concerned , are becoming more and more interested in books of a higher character and merit than the average contemporary novel .

		This I can not consider but as a welcome cliange in the intellectual taste of the public .

		Yet , strange to say , there is no decline in the demand for the works of such classical novelists as
Scott	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Next to these , historical works find most favor among our readers . ''

		It would be interesting to know whether this falling-off in novel-reading was a spontaneous , or an assisted , perhaps even to some extent a forced , diminution .

		There are subtle ways , known to librarians , for discouraging an over-fondness foi ' current fiction .

		, .

		.

		Government recognition of literary worth in
England	LOCATION	has already been approvingly noted of late in these columns .

		To the men and women writers in receipt of pensions from the British gov - ernment are now to be added the following , who have deserved well of their country : Sir
F. C. Burnand	PERSON	, # 200 yearly ; Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	, '' in consideration of the merits of his poetical works , '' # 100 a year ;
Miss M. Betham Edwards	PERSON	, # 50 annu - ally ; Mrs.
Florence Maitland	PERSON	, in recognition of her late husband 's services to law and history , # 100 each year ; Mr.
George Howell	PERSON	, for his writings upon labor subjects , # 50 yearly ; and ''
Ouida	PERSON	, '' for her services to romance , a pension of # 1,50 .

		It is pleasant to be thus honored .

		It is even more than pleasant to be able , as was
Carlyle	PERSON	, to decline such honors .

		... A well-earned tribute to a veteran editor was that lately paid to Mr.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	by the college from which he was graduated fifty years ago .

		Rather noteworthy are some of the details of the ceremony that made Mr.
Alden	PERSON	a doctor of laws of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, which had already honored itself by making him a doctor of letters .

		President
Henry Hopkins	PERSON	, who has , as executive head of the college , bestowed this later honor , is the son of the famous
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	, in the twenty-first year of whose presidency of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	young
Alden	PERSON	took his baccalaureate degree , one year before the present president was graduated from the same college .

		Thus the two college mates came together again -- in a more amicable relation , it is safe to say , than that into which they entered fifty-thi-ee years ago as sophomore and freshman , respectively .

		RECENT LIBRARY PROGRESS IN
ALABAMA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of
The Diai	ORGANIZATION	.

		. -RRB-

		K paragraph concerning the iibrarj ' situation in
Georgia	LOCATION	, in the issue of The Dial for
August 1	DATE	, impels me to write this brief uote concemiug recent library progress in
Alabama	LOCATION	.

		I think your remark that '' public libraries in the South are almost as rare as \ - iolets in
October	DATE	`` contains a gratuitous reflection on a part of the countr > ' which , while far from being as forward as other sections in this respect , is evidencing at the present time most commendable activity .

		There are many reasons why we have not developed fi-ee public libraries in the States of the South , notably because of the poverty of this section for the last forty years .

		For the
last ten years	DATE	, however , there has been a decided renaissance in library work , and our progress during that period is quite as advanced as progress elsewhere during the first decade of the beginnings of the movement .

		But I am not writing this in a controversial way , and only wish you to know that your readers in the South would prefer that , after full information , a word of commendation for praiseworthy effort be given , rather than criticism for a backwardness which , on examination , can be satis - factorily explained .

		The library notes that appear in The Dial from time to time indicate an interest in the furtherance of this phase of educational acti ^ aty , and I therefore wish particularly to call yoiu - attention to one part of the programme of the recent
AshevUle Conference of the American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, held during the latter part of
May	DATE	.

		At that session Miss
Anne Wallace	PERSON	, librarian of the Carnegie Librarj '' of -
Atlanta	LOCATION	, reviewed the history and recent progress of library development in the South generally smce
1899	DATE	, and she was followed by representatives of the several
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		Her address appears in the
June	DATE	issue of `` The Library Journal , '' and while not altogether as full as it might have been made , I think in the main it b a good review .

		I had the honor to appear for
Alabama	LOCATION	.

		While
Georgia	LOCATION	was the first of the States of the South to create a
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, no appropriations have as yet been made to carry forward its work .

		Therefore to
Alabama	LOCATION	belongs the honor of first enter - ing upou State-supported librair work in the South .

		At the
Spring	ORGANIZATION	session of our
State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, by act of
March 5 , 1907	DATE	, the
Department of Archives	ORGANIZATION	and His - tory , of which I am Director , was required to promote the organization and development of pubhc and school libraries , etc. , and to build up a leg ^ .

		slative reference col - lection .

		The act is herewith given in fuU , inasmuch as it is very short , and particidarly as it further illustrates how much can be stated in a general way on a given proposition without burdeuiug the statute with details wliich are properly left to administrative development . ''

		In addition to the duties now required by law .

		the Depart - ment of Archives and History shall do and perfonn the following : `` l .

		It shall encourage and assist in the establishment of public and school libraries , and in the improvement and strengthening of those already in existence ; it shall give advice and provide assistance to librarians and library workers in library administration , methods , and economy ; and it shall conduct a system of travelling libraries . ''

		2 .

		It shall bring together and arrange for ready constilta - tion a reference collection of materials for the use of the members of the legislature .

		State ofBcers .

		and others , on all sabjects which may .

		from time to time , be deemed of public interest and importance to the people of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Not to speak now of the development of the division of Legislative Reference , the division of Librarj '
Exten	ORGANIZATION	- sion went into operation
June 1	DATE	, its work has been out - Uned , and an assistant has been placed in charge .

		The plan of work proposed involves public Ubrary promotion , school Ubrary promotion , uistruction and supervision , travelling Ubraries , magazine clearing-house , and library publication .

		The activity of the new diraion has already been evidenced from the fact that I have secured the incorporation of the following section in the municipal code , only adopted in the hjst few days by the late Summer session of our State Legislature : ■ ■
Sec	ORGANIZATION	.

		178 .

		Cities and towns shall have the right to establish and maintain , or aid in establishing or maintaining , public libraries , either separately or in connection with the public schools . ''

		I think you wiU agree witii me that the adoption of this section puts beyond peradventure the development of free pubhc hbraries in
Alabama	LOCATION	.

		Their establishment now only depends upon the amount of inspirational work which the new division of Library Extension can do .

		Before closing , I desire to say that we have in
Alabama	LOCATION	more than a himdred free public and institu - tional hbraries , of which eleven are
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	hbraries .

		Three of the latter are , however , school Ubraries .

		I might further add that our Legislature of
1907	DATE	has made possible , by adequate appropriations , the erection of sepa - rate library buildings at our
State University	ORGANIZATION	and also at our
Polytechnic Institute	ORGANIZATION	, to cost in each case over fifty thousand doUars .

		News has just been received that our State Girls ' School , at
Montevallo	LOCATION	, has elevated its library to a separate department , with a trained Ubrarian in charge ; as has also been done by our
Jacksonville State Normal School	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new division of library Extension will conduct a
summer	DATE	school for the prelim - inary training of Ubrariaus , beginning next siunmer .

		I ought also to add that we liave a
State Library Associ	ORGANIZATION	- ation , organized in
1904	DATE	, which has held three annual meetings , and is doing good work , with a membership of over seventy-five .

		All in all , our progress is indeed considerable ; and I liave written thus at length in order that the facts may be known to your readers .

		I doubt not that you will be as much gratified as anyone else .

		Men axd Max neks of French Revolutionary Days .

		* A volume of lively memoirs , written by a gifted Frenchwoman to divert her thoughts from personal sorrows , and left lying in manuscript for the better part of a century , is now , after all fear of hurting the feelings of any persons concerned is past , brought out in both French and English and offered to a public almost as greedy of this kind of light literature as it is of fiction .

		The
Comtesse de Boigne	ORGANIZATION	does not claim for her book any historical importance , nor does she strive for accuracy in matters of fact ; but with running pen she records chiefly her mem - ories and impressions of persons , mostly persons of note , whom the curious reader can not look at from too many points of view , and who are here handled with that quick and pitiless pene - tration that makes many women and all children at once a terror and a delight to those aroimd them .

		Charlotte
Louise Eleonore Adelaide	PERSON	d'Os - mond -LRB- 1781-1866 -RRB- , daughter of the
Marquis d'Osmond	PERSON	, a military man , a courtier , a diplo - mat , and a stanch royalist to the end , owed to the turbulent times in which her youth was cast her early experience of life in several lands and her wide acquaintance with notable characters of many sorts .

		Some of her most interesting memories go back to her sojourn in
England	LOCATION	, where her family for several years lived as emigres .

		It was in
London	LOCATION	that the young
Comtesse	ORGANIZATION	's charms attracted the notice of Gen - eral de Boigne -LRB- known in earlier life as
Benoit Leborgne	PERSON	, the son of a furrier -RRB- , who , though nearly three times her age , succeeded in win - ning her hand in marriage .

		But there was no love lost on either side : he admired her beauty and valued her high birth , and she desired his wealth , which had been amassed in
India	LOCATION	, to relieve the necessities of her family .

		In accept - ing him she yielded to the generous impidse of a girl of seventeen ; and if she never regretted her act of self-sacrifice , it was not because her ill-bred husband gave her no cause .

		He died in
1830	DATE	, leaving her a fortune to enjoy for thirty-six comparatively serene years after her thirty-two troubled years of matrimony .

		It was a union unblessed by offspring , and at her death her grand-nephew , the then

		Edited by
M. Charles Nicoulland	PERSON	.

		With portrait .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		was made her chief heir and her literary ex - ecutor .

		At his decease , not many years ago , his intimate friend ,
Charles Nicoulland	PERSON	, became re - sponsible for the disposition of the
Comtesse de Boigne	ORGANIZATION	's memoirs , which are now made public .

		A few passages , descriptive of persons and manners , will be quoted , as much more inter - esting than any labored synopsis of what the author 's lively pages contain .

		And first of aU a brief reference to the writer herself in her childhood will be in order .

		She appears , even as an infant , to have possessed unusual accom - plishments . ''

		I was brought up literally upon the knees of the royal family .

		Tlie King and Queen especially over - whelmed me with kindness ... My father had taken pains to develop my intelligence , and I was honestly regarded as a little prodigy .

		I had learnt to read with such facility that at the age of three I could read and repeat the tragedies of
Racine	LOCATION	for my own pleasure , and , it i.s said , for the pleasure of others . ''

		Some years later , when she was in her ` teens , we find her reatling
Adam Smith	PERSON	's '' Wealth of Nations '' as a pastime , for which she was well laughed at by her friends .

		Respecting the peculiar etiquette of French society shortly before the Revolution , the Comtesse writes : '' The social tone was so free that my mother -LSB- a Worcestershire woman -RSB- has told me tliat she was often embarrassed to the point of tears .

		During the first years of her marriage the sarcasms and jests to which she was exposed often made her very imhappy ... An old grand vieaire , who happened to be in the midst of this cheer - ful company , seeing her very sad one day , remarked : '
Marquise	PERSON	, do not worry ; one of your faults is your beauty , but that will be pardoned .

		But if you wish to live peaceably , take more pains to conceal your love for your husband ; it is the one kind of love which is not tolerated here . '

		... On the whole if the language of this society was free , its actions were extremely restrained .

		A man who placed his hand on the arm of a chair occupied by a lady would have been considered excessively rude .

		Only the greatest intimacy coidd justify a walk arm in arm , and that was imusual , even in the country .

		Gentlemen never offered their arms or their hands to take a lady in to diimer , and a man would never have sat down on a sofa together with a lady ; but language , on the other hand , was free to the point of licentiousness . ''

		The descriptions of prominent persons of the time are numerous and good .

		Even to name all the great with whom the writer mingled and whom she has thus sketched , would take too long .

		As a specimen of her art , here is a realistic picture of Mme. de Stael : '' At first she seemed to me ugly and ridiculous .

		A big red face , a complexion by no means fresh , and her hair arranged in a manner which she called picturesque , in other words , badly done ; no fichu , a white muslin blouse , out very low , arms and shoulders bare , no shawl , ^
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 scarf , or veil of any kind -- snch was the stnmge appa - rition which appeared in a hotel room at mid-dav .

		She ^ held a small twig , which she was constantly twiddling in her fillers , with the object , I think , of showing off a Tcty besatiful hand , tho ^ fa it was bat the finishing toueh to the eceentricitr of her eostnme .

		At the end of an hoar I was entirelT under her charm .

		* ' Admiration for the beautiful and virtuous
Comtesse	ORGANIZATION	is increased by reading what she had to endure from the coarseness and brutality of her husband .

		`` The rapidity with which he had passed from the lowest rank to the position of commander-in-chief and from povertv to vast wealth had never permitted him to j acquire any social polish , and the balnts of polite society were entirelv unknown to him .

		An illness from which he was recovering had forced him to make an immoderate nse of < ^ iimi , which had paralyzed his moral and physical jiowera .

		Tears of life in
India	LOCATION	had added the
fall	DATE	force of Orieotal jealousy to that which woold naturally arise in the mind of a man of his age ; in addition to this he was endowed with the mast diaagieeaUe character that ;
Providence	LOCATION	ever granted to man .

		He wiriied to arouse dislike a ^ others wished to please .

		He was anxioas to make every one feel the domination of his great wealUi , i and he thought that the only mode of malm ^ aaii npres - I
$ doD	MONEY	was to hurt the feelings of otlKr people .

		Heinsalted his servants , he offended his giteate , and his wife was a fortiori , a victim to this grievous & alt of character . ''

		The first beginnings of sea-bathing in
France	LOCATION	are incidentally described by the author .

		This cure for headaches and other ailments she had found successful in
England	LOCATION	, and in the
summer of 1806	DATE	she detennined to trj - the same at
Dieppe	LOCATION	.

		`` As for the cHHnforts arranged for the convenience of bathers which
Dieppe	LOCATION	has since organised , they were non-existent at that time .

		My brother was able to find a little covered cart , and with great trouble and great expense , notwithstanding the universal poverty , a man was hired to lead the hones down to the sea , and two women to go into the sea with me .

		These preparations raised the public cariosity to such a pitch that my first hadies were watched by ' a crowd on the shore .

		My servants were asked if I had been bitten by a mad dog .

		I aroused extreme pity as I went by , and it was thought that I was being taken to be drowned .

		An old gentle - man called on my & ther to point out to him that he was aasoming a great responsibility in permitting so lash an act .

		It can hardly be imagined that the inhabitants of ' a seashore should be so afraid of the sea .

		Bnt at that ' time the people of
Dieppe	LOCATION	were chietly occupied in keep - ing out of sight of it stud in protecting themselves from the disasters which they feared the sea might Mng , i so that it was for them nothing more than a means of ' annoyanee and suffering .

		It is carious to think that ten yeais later bathers were arriving in hondreds , that special arrangements were made for their convenience , and that sea-bathing of every kind went on without producing any astonishment in the neighborhood .

		I have thus attempted to point out that the costom of sea-bathing , whi -LRB- ^ is now so universal , is comparatively r ```` ent in
France	LOCATION	, for

Korea	LOCATION	- * Certain fimdamental changes which are com - ing about as results of the late war in the Far East are described with insight and vigor by Mr.
Homer B. Hulbert	PERSON	in his latest book , • • The Passing of
Korea	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	has been for many years a resident of
Korea	LOCATION	and editor of • • The Korean Review , '' and it may be doubted whether any other man is so well qualified to give the world a trustworthy portrayal of Korean civilization .

		In him the
Koreans	LOCATION	have a warm , though discriminating , friend ; and we are given frankly to understand that the present Ixx ^ has been wTitten with the purpose primarily of '' ■ interesting the reading public in a cotmtry and a people that have been frequently maligned and seldom appreciated . ''

		Country and people are therefore described in all their more , important aspects , and with much detail : and there is .

		besides , a good deal of history - -- some ten or twelve chapters con - densed from the author 's previously published '' History of
Korea	LOCATION	. ''

		Both history and descrip - tion are well done , but for most readers doubt - less the chief interest in Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	's book will coitre about its discussion of the future of
Korea	LOCATION	as an integral part of the new Japanese Empire .

		mas -
86	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, from the Korean standpoint , a genuine calamity .

		The reasons for his view are interesting .

		They are two-fold : the agreeable and jiromising char - acter of the Korean people , and the external and ai-tificial nature of
Japan	LOCATION	's alleged modern civil - ization . ''

		The Koreans , '' says the author , '' ai-e overshadowed by
China	LOCATION	on the one liand in respect of numbers , and by
Japan	LOCATION	on the other in respect of wit .

		They are neither good mer - chants like the one nor gootl fighters like the other , and yet they are far more like
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons in tempei-ament than either , and they are by far the pleasantest people in the
Far East	LOCATION	to live among-st . ''

		If the Korean appears unthrifty , happy-go-lucky , and narrow-minded , he is so , in Mr.
Hidbert	PERSON	's opinion , not because these ai-e his intrinsic characteristics , but only because he has had to bear for a thousand years the incubus of Chinese civilization , without being allowed an opportunity to develop his capacities independently and naturally .

		It is his environ - ment that has been at fault , rather than his natural endowments .

		Rational conservatism , generosity , hospitality , personal pride -- these are some of the good qualities wliich have not been crushed out of him .

		His veracity and business honesty are at least up to the best standards of the Orient , and the same thing , if nothing l > etter , can be said for his personal morals .

		On the whole , the
Koreans	LOCATION	are not so exce -RCB- > tional a people that their absorption by a more powerful nation would be a cause for general regret , provided the absorbing nation were able to guarantee the extension of a civilization fun - damentally superior .

		Bvit this is a guarantee which Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	firmly believes
Japan	LOCATION	is unable to give .

		In these days of universal and more or less indiscriminate laudation of
Japan	LOCATION	and everything Jajjanese , it is perhaps whole - some to have such an incisive , even if somewhat overdrawn , presentation of the weaknesses and dangers of contemporary Japanese culture and influence .

		In a succession of pungent para - graphs , Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	has sought mercilessly to strip the glamour from Japanese progress dur - ing the past half century .

		The national meta ^ morphosis which has challenged the attention of the world is declared by him to have been , with very few exceptions , a thoroughly selfish move - ment , conceived in the interests of class dis - tinction and propagated with anything but an altruistic motive .

		`` When he -LSB- the Japanese -RSB- adopted Western methods , it was in a purely utilitarian spirit .

		He gave no thought to the principles on which our civilization is based .

		It was the finished product he was after and not the process .

		Everything goes to prove that
Japan	LOCATION	, insteatl of digging until she struck the
spring	DATE	of Western culture , merely built a cistern in which she stored up some of its more obvious and tangible results . ''

		The bearing of this upon the future of the
Koreans	LOCATION	constitutes Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	's second reason why
Korea	LOCATION	's absorption by
Japan	LOCATION	is a misfortune . ''

		Herein , '' he says , '' lies the pathos of
Korea	LOCATION	's -RSB- X -RRB- sition : lying as she does in the grip of
Japan	LOCATION	, she can not gain from that power more than that power is capable of giving -- nothing more than the garments of the
West	LOCATION	.

		She may learn science and the industrial arts , but she will use them only as a parrot uses human speech . ''

		Waiving the question as to whether
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	civilization can be taken over by an Oriental people in any other fashion than as the Japanese have taken it , the point which Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	makes seems to have much weight .

		At any rate , the American who in these days of rapid transition in the
East	LOCATION	, and notably in
Korea	LOCATION	itself , is desirous of having put before him a view of things which is quite out of the conventional , can not do better than read Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	's book .

		Among chapters purely descriptive of the
Koreans	LOCATION	, the best are those dealing with their industries , their literature and folk-lore , their art , and their religion and superstitions .

		The volume is copiously illustrated with tinted repro - ductions of photographs taken by the author .

		These could scarcely be improved , and , indeed , mechanically the book is in every respect a model .

		THE DIAL .

		87 has the last det-atle produced quite so much written trash .

		The delving anthropologist is certainly quite right in enlarging upon the matri - archate among primitive peoples : and the latest critic of things American may be right when he insists that intellectually we are under a gyneco - cracy .

		It does not therefore follow that Mars is inhabited , or that the Millennium will burst upon us when the '' happy afterthought '' returns to his primal inferiority .

		It is surely time to cease uttering haphazard conclusions or fleeting dreams as reasoned and abiding truth .

		We need definite historical studies on essential phases of the problem in significant periods .

		Manifestly , one such period is formed bj ' the centuries that saw the transition of the Greek and Roman world from paganism to
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		It is remarkable how the cataclysmic interpretation of hLstorj ' has persisted in so many treatments of the position of woman during this epoch ; and the concomitant niLsconceptions have been not less harmful than unptanlonable .

		Xausicaa of the white arms , Asjiasia of the unspeakable charm , the giftetl and noble Ojmelia .

		the pagan mart -RCB- T Arria , and the Christian martyr Blandina .

		may seem a strange group ; yet they must lie studied together if we are to deal intelligently with the historical aspects of our pi-oblem .

		From the Homeric poems one can draw only a pleasant picture of woman and her position , even when the disagreeable elements have been given all possible prominence .

		The civilization depicted was high but young : and even the Greeks , favorites of the gods though they were , coiUd not escape the laws of development .

		If more writers had borne this in mind we should have been burdened with fewer apologies for the existence of concubinage and some kindred customs .

		In any event , the Homeric concubine , who might be the mother of well-beloved chil - dren , was appreciably higher in the scale of humanity than the modem sterile femme entre - tenue .

		Probably , too , she was quite as happy .

		Withal , the Homeric Greeks had arrived at monogamy based on affection , and were capable of high and glowing devotion .

		That senti - mental passion , in our modem sense , had a real existence , it would be hartl to prove ; but true marital affection has seldom been as highly prized as among these restless tribes .

		And in this connection a dictum of
Gibbon	PERSON	is woi-th recalling : '' The refinements of life corrupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes .

		The gross appetite of love becomes most danger - ous when it is elevated , or rather disguised , by sentimental pa-ssion . ''

		When future ages have grown weary of mati-imonial discussions in tome after tome , they wUl tiu ^ with joy that is ever fresh to the pictiii-es of Hector and Andromache , of
Penelope	PERSON	and her wandering lord .

		To the womanhood of the poems we may apply the wokIs of the poet himself about the fair lady of
Ithaca	LOCATION	: '' The fame of her virtue wdll never perish , but the immortals will make a gracious sons in the ears of men on earth to the fame of the constant
Penelope	PERSON	. ''

		K woman is honored as a wife and revered as a mother , if she lives in an atmosphere of mildness , if she is happy and healthful , most of her crying wrongs be `` ome significantly insignificant .

		And inasmuch as this is fairly true of the Homeric woman , it would seem that there is not much of a woman question .

		In later
Greece	LOCATION	the sky is not so unclouded .

		At
Athens	LOCATION	, for instance , in
the second half of the fifth century	DATE	B. c , the citizen woman -- so we are always told -- was a dutiful nonentity , and the charm of female society was sought from the flowers of delight known as '' hetaine '' or companions .

		Unfortimately .

		one may dis - coimt the least reliable evidence and still find an ugly balance of truth in the current con - ception .

		However , as to the traditional complete submissiveness of the '' dutiful nonentity '' and the utter wretchedness of her lot , your reviewer is decidedly skeptical .

		A little weighing of this anecdote and that , a careful reading of Euripides and Aristophanes , with an occasional peering between the lines , would seem to show that Athenian wives hatl almost American wills and even ultra - American resourcefulness .

		Likewise a few general considerations would suggest con - clusions rather at variance with accepted views .

		By way of example , one might ask how it could come to pass that
Aspasia	LOCATION	and so many others of her profession should have incomparable brilliance , and at the same time not a single respectable woman should manifest a glimmer of brightness .

		Or again , is it quite probable that utterly stupid women were the mothers of all the men of genius that made the Periclean period the envy of its most enlightened successors ?

		Indeed , Ein-ipides insists on the cleverness of the softer sex : and clever women have never lacked effective methods of exercising influence or ameliorating their condition .

		Taking it all in all , we may safely conclude that Athenian women in the golden age were something more than dutifid nonentities ; and one could even adduce considei-able evidence to show the exist - ence of a woman `` s movement of no contemptible proportions .

		88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, When we transfer our observations to pagan
Rome	LOCATION	, we find an exceptional opportunity to follow the emancipation of woman in its rela - tion to economic influences .

		The wife in the struggling town on the hUls by the Tiber became a different woman in the city that ruled aU
Italy	LOCATION	, and she in turn became a third woman when
Rome	LOCATION	rose to be the opident domina orhis ter - rarum .

		In this last period the matron and her daughter achieved a degi-ee of freedom that has only been regained in i-ecent years .

		Of these centuries the average person has a most thorough misconception , partly because of the tendency in human nature to dwell upon the striking side of things , partly because '' it has been the delight of writers who wish to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity to heathenism , to bring into special prominence the supposed vices and humiliations of pagan women . ''

		Herewith we are brought to Christianity , and the most important part of the book we are considering .

		The early church is a field in wliich
Principal Donaldson	ORGANIZATION	has worked long and patiently .

		Furthermore , he has reached the age of sober and mature judgment , and he is apparently able to doff the prejudice that so often mars the treatments of our subject in this period .

		Accordingly his conclusions seem eminently worthy of respect , and we may quote a central paragraph . ''

		At the time when Christianity dawned on the world , woman had attained ... great freedom , power , and influence in the Roman Empire .

		Tradition was in favor of restriction , but by a concurrence of circumstances women had been liberated from the enslaving fetters of the old legal forms , and they enjoyed freedom of inter - course in society ; they walked and drove in the public thoroughfares with veils that did not conceal their faces , they dined in the company of men , they studied liter - ature and philosophy , they took part in political move - ments , they were allowed to defend their own cases if they liked , and they helped their husbands ui the govern - ment of provinces and in the writing of books .

		One would have imagined that Christianity would have favoured the ertensiou of woman 's freedom .

		For ChiTstianity itself wa-s one of the most daring revolu - tions which the world has ever seen .

		It defied all past customs , it aimed at the overthrow of the religions of the world , it overleapt the barriers of nationality , and it desired to fuse all mankind into one family and one faith .

		Necessarily , such a movement was aecompauied by much excitement and agitation ; but when enthusiasm sways any association of men , and they live in a state of ferment , they break in pieces the bonds of custom -- those very bonds which most firmly chain women down to a slavish position of ivutine .

		Accordingly , at the very first stage women take a prominent part in the spread of Christianity and all the activities of Christians .

		But in a short time this state of matters ceases in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and women are seen only in two Qapaoities -- as martyrs and iis deaconesses . ''

		The degradation was rapid .

		It is not long before TertuUian speaks of wives as '' women of the second degree of modesty , who have fallen into wedlock '' ; and
Clement	PERSON	of
Alexandria	LOCATION	not only regards birth as the entry upon a bitter road of life , with the gi'ave as the wayfarer 's inn , but holds the mother responsible for this beginning of woe .

		It was a terrible age , when those who lived nearest to their ideals left the fewest children .

		Our author might have pointed out that these phenomena were pretty closely connected with the early Christian belief in the proximate ending of the world , -- not a vague figurative transition , but a literal , terrible crash - ing of earth 's old bones .

		With this belief keenly operative , the male Chi-istian was bound to regard his female comrade as a source of imhappiness and dire temptation .

		Woman was the devil 's gateway .

		It was inevitable , then , that she shoiUd be treated with all possible contumely ; and her position needs no comment .

		Strictly , this notice need go no further ; but we may be pardoned foi - insisting that the progress of woman has been simply a phase of our general forward movement .

		We may prate of Teutonic influence and church influence as we will ; the fact remains that the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, with its intellectual awakening , was tremen - dously important in this field as in so many others .

		As man 's mind developed , it was a matter of course that a new attitude toward woman should come into being .

		To assign this change to Teutonic or Christian influence is to lose one 's historical perspective .

		We return to another phase of the thought with which we began : '' A true conception of woman 's ideal life can be reached only by the long experience of the ages . ''

		In the volume before us .

		Principal Donaldson has reprinted several articles from the '' Con - temporary Review '' ; but they have been care - fully revised as well as considerably augmented .

		To these he has added a supplementary section of sixty-three pages containing notes that are interesting and important .

		Herein the brief chapter on '' Women in
Egypt	LOCATION	'' is perhaps the most deser \ ` ing of attention , particularly for its utilization of recently discovered papyri .

		An actual maiTiage contract dating from 92 B. c. is evidence of the sort that replaces most acceptably almost any number of controversial allegations .

		After this supplementary book comes a bibliography , which is all the more ser - viceable for daring to be incomplete .

		There is also an adequate index .

		We conclude by recording the impression of
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 sanity and clarity produced alike by the first and the second reading of this modest work .

		Occasional ! -RCB-

		- we might quarrel about a nuance of interpretation or of presentation .

		For instance , in dealing with Homeric davs there is surely an undulj ' modem connotation when a writer speaks of the captive woman 's becoming the mistj-ess of her husband 's conqueror .

		Again , in the chap - ter on '' Athenian Women '' we read : '' This state of matters had a | K -RRB- werful effect on their wives .

		Many of them consoled themselves in their loneliness with copious draughts of un - mixed wine . ''

		It is true that we do hear of resort to this source of comfort ; but the state - ment as it stands is a little too suggestive of a ' prevalent custom .

		Aristophanic merriment is not to be taken too seriously .

		However , a continuation of these criticisms of scattered points woidd only emphasize the pleasing gen - eral impression of carefidness and soimd work - manship .

		The essential parts are readable and instructive ; the whole is valuable .

New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		stimulated by this apotheosis has its counterpart in one of the incidents related in a little book that has provoked these reflections , ''
Napoleon	PERSON	: The Return from
Saint Helena	PERSON	. ''

		The author , Mr.
Phyfe	PERSON	, says that as the vessel bearing
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's body ascended the Seine from
Rouen	LOCATION	, '' Aged pea-sants were seen discharging anti- quated firearms in salute , or weeping in sUence as their hero passed by . ''

		Although many of these may have been , as Mr.
Phyfe	PERSON	suggests , veterans of the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	, no class had suf - fered more from the sins of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's later years than the peasants .

		These sufferings they had forgotten ; but they remembered the epic experiences which some of them had had , and the glory that had covered
France	LOCATION	.

		Every great adventurer finds his best ally in the imag - inations of his dupes .

		There are still students , even outside
France	LOCATION	, who can not think evil of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		One of these is Mr.
Oscar Browning	PERSON	, whose book on `` The Youth of Napoleon , '' reviewed in these columns several months ago , showed , like the present volume on `` The Fall of
Napoleon	PERSON	, '' an attitude of unqualified admiration .

		This atti - tude does not lead Mr.
Browning	PERSON	to cover up facts which others regard as damaging , but simply to look at them from another point of view .

		He al.so relates quite impassively many incidents which prove that
Napoleon	PERSON	, in
1813	DATE	,
1814	DATE	, and
1815	DATE	, had become unpopular locally .

		The first third of the volume is taken up with an account of the wars and diplomacy of
1813	DATE	and
1814	DATE	, and impresses one mainly as being a spirited resume , subject , however , to reserves touching interpretations of diplomatic policies .

		The narrative gains in interest after this pre - liminary work is done and attention is concen - trated upon
Napoleon	PERSON	himself , his conduct , and the strange vicissitudes of his fortune during the months which followed the first abdication .

		Here the groxmd is not bristling with contro - versy , and , through the labors of French writers like
Houssaye	PERSON	and
Masson	PERSON	, a good deal of fresh material is available .

		One noticeable feature of Mr.
Browning	PERSON	's work is the sense of propor - tion which he has maintained throughout his treatment of these singularly troubled years .

		If he has ever wished to linger over the details of some favorite incident or theme , he has re - sisted the temptation .

		In studpng the diplomatic situation , particu - larly that of
1813	DATE	, Mr.
Browning	PERSON	has closely followed the late
Albert Sorel	PERSON	.

		In his preface he makes this one of the chief merits of his book .

		It is unfortunate that for this very period 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
M. Sorel	PERSON	's work supports a brilliant but not impartial interpretation of the changing attitude of the Allies , and especially of
Austria	LOCATION	under the guidance of
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	.

		Too completely persuaded by
M. Sorel	PERSON	's arguments , Mr.
Browning	PERSON	calls
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	's plans an '' infa - mous plot . ''

		His theory is that
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	's propositions were simply a lure , by which
Napoleon	PERSON	was to be drawn into a negotiation , and put at a disadvantage from which he was not to extricate himself untU he had been stripped of honor and provinces and driven back within the ancient boimdaries of
France	LOCATION	.

		He believes with
Sorel	PERSON	that the convention made by
Austria	LOCATION	with
Russia	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	at
Reichenbach	ORGANIZATION	in
Jime	ORGANIZATION	, taken in connection with a convention between
England	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	earlier in the montli and the treaty of Kalisch between
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	in
February	DATE	, bound
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	to the extreme terms which
England	ORGANIZATION	wished to make .

		The comparatively moderate terms wliich
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	proposed to
Napoleon	PERSON	through Count Bubna , or which had been suggested by his own conversations with
Narbonne	ORGANIZATION	, had not the purpose , therefore , of offering a basis for peace , but were intended merely to conunit
Napoleon	PERSON	to the policy of retreat , to start him '' on the rmi `` as it were .

		Once entered on the road of concession , he was not to be allowed to pause , as harsher and harsher terms were revealed , until the veil was finally torn aside and he .

		found himself humiliated , face to face with his inexorable antagonist , forced to accept an '' English '' peace .

		Such a theory does not take sufficient account of the distinct policy which
Austria	LOCATION	had followed in
1812	DATE	and was following again in
1813	DATE	, and which became fully developed as Metternich recognized in the happy situation of events the possibility of recovei'ing her ancient prestige and territory upon the ruins of which the
Grand Empire	ORGANIZATION	had been founded .

		If Mr.
Browning	PERSON	did not lay so much emphasis on this feature of his book , it would be a mis - take to do it here ; but the reader should be on his guard against accepting as proved a thesis so doubtful .

		In reading an account of the campaign of
1813	DATE	, one 's mind goes back naturally to the earlier struggle with
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, when
Jena	PERSON	and
Friedland	PERSON	were followed up in a manner so different from that of Liitzen and
Bautzen	LOCATION	.

		The comparison is all the easier because of Mr.
Petre	PERSON	's republication , in a third edition , of ''
Napoleon	PERSON	's Campaign in
Poland	LOCATION	, '' and of the appearance of his new volume on ^
Napoleon	PERSON	's Conquest of
Prussia	LOCATION	. ''

		The con - trast is not so nmch in the capacity of the man at the two periods as in the resources which he had at his disposal and the way in which he had organized them .

		Nearly half of the new volume is filled with a detailed description of the relent - less pursuit of the fragments of the Prussian army after
Jena	PERSON	.

		Of the two principal battles ,
Jena and Auerstiitlt	PERSON	, the description of
Auer	PERSON	- stadt seems clearer and more interesting .

		The photographs of the field of
Jena	ORGANIZATION	, to which Mr.
Petre	PERSON	seems to attach some importance , con - fuse the impression of the layman , especially when studied in connection with the map which exhibits the contour of the country .

		The most instructive passage of the book is the description of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's army atlministration in the field and of the loose and ineffective organization of the Prussian staff .

		In the crisis of a campaign , the element of time is vital ; and it was by util - izing this better than did his opponents , as well as because of their mistakes , that these victories were won .

		The two volumes by Mr.
Petre	PERSON	show
Napoleon	PERSON	's military atlniinistration and campaign management at the height of his power , when it was used to complete the edifice of the Gi-and Empire ; and Mr.
Browning	PERSON	's book , read discreetly , furnishes a clear account of the rum of this
Empire	ORGANIZATION	while its creator was playing the game of its defence with a gambler 's recklessness .

		91 lection into a volume of many scattered pieces of verse , the whole being entitled ' * Said the Rose , and Other Lyrics . ''

		Although ``
Christine	PERSON	, and Other Poems , '' an earlier volume , was published during the poet 's lifetime , and dieted praise from such men as
Holmes	PERSON	, the author is practically unknown to our day .

		and his name appeals neither in Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' American Anthologj ' '' nor in tl > e standard histories of our literature .

		Reading the fifty pages of Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's appreciative essay , we learn anew the lesson of fame 's caprice , for we become ac -LRB- -LCB- uainted with a writer of admirable qualities , whose performance certainly deserved something less than the entire forgetfulness that seems to have become its portion .

		The titidar lyric is the plaint of a rose , plucked by a lady to wear upon her bosom for an hour , and then east ruthlessly away . '

		* How the jealous garden gloried In my fall !

		How the honeysuckles chid me .

		How the sneering jasmins bid me Light the long , gray grass that hid me Like a pall . '

		• There 1 lay beneath her window - In a swoon .

		Till the earthworm oer me trailing Woke me just at twilight 's fuling .

		As the whip-poor-will was wailing To the moon . '

		■ But I hear the storm-winds stirriagf In their lair : And I know they soon will lift me In their giant arms and sift me Into ashes as they drift me Through the air . '

		■ So I pray them in their mercy Just to take From my heart of hearts or near it The last living leaf , and bear it To her feet , and bid her wear it For my sake . ''

		These are the last four of the fourteen charming stanzas .

		A number of the poems in tliis volume are impressions of
Italy	LOCATION	, piarticnlarly of Italian art , and the influence of
Browning	PERSON	is veiy e \ ` ident .

		Here is the striking close of the lines on the Sistine Madonna : ■ ' Sir .

		`` tis strange ; That wondrous Virgin face , which
Raphael	PERSON	plucked From his vast soul four centuries ago .

		Is breathing now , -- not in his
Italy	LOCATION	-- Bnt on the shores where then first flashed the sail Of
Genoa	LOCATION	's ocean Pilot .

		Years ago .

		We met mid-heav ` n , like drops of
summer	DATE	rain .

		Then , falling , parted I -- But -- observe the picture : Am I not right ?

		-- There -- just before them bums .

		Viewless to us , the unveiled Omnipotent .

		Yet , somehow , critics fail to see .

		or say this . ''

		How easily that defective last line might have been changed to its advantage .

		■ ■ Yet this , somehow , the critics fail to see . ''

		A poem of a very different sort is the '' Aladdin 's Palace , '' written for the semi-centenary of the Catholic college wnth which the poet was connected .

		In these lines he waxes satirical over the degeneracy of the age .

		The moral of it all is that the work of the Saint is needed to complete tlie Aladdin pala `` e of oiu - material civilization .

		Here is a passage con - cerning literary taste that -- with a suitable .

		substi - tution of names -- may be taken to heart in onr oym days : '' Alas !

		the river where the millions drink Flows from a
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	of tainted ink : Lower and lower the darkening stream descends .

		Till , lost in filth , the sacred fountain ends .

		Who reads
Andrea	PERSON	?

		here 's a penny tale That melts the milkmaid o'er her foaming pail ; Who weeps with
Luria	PERSON	that can weekly sob With all the victims of Sylvanns Cobb ?

		To ' In Memoriam ' why trembling turn When fonder pathos flows from Fanny Fern ?

		Why wake the organ wail of Hiawatha When piping publishers assume the author ? ''

		The degenei-acy of our political life evokes these telling couplets : '' O Land of Lads , and Liberty , and Dollars !

		O Nation first in schools and last in scholars !

		Where few are ignorant , yet none excel .

		Whose peasants read , whose statesmen scarcely spell ; Of what avail that science lights the way When dwindling Senates totter to decay , -- Like some tall poplar withered at the head , Onr middle green , but all the summit dead .

		We do not ask that mind and manners meet -- Utopian dream -- in every Justice seat : In troubled times 't is not to be expected - r That Law and Grammar be at once protected : We can endure that barristers dispense ' '' > Tropes , neither rhetoric nor common sense .

		.

		, While all the rabble bolt the fluent store Of broken image , battered metaphor .

		-- But , great
Diana	PERSON	, when we 're only known .

		In courts where
Adams	PERSON	trod and
Franklin	PERSON	shone .

		By mute Ambassadors who grandly soom to Maim any language save the one they 're bom to ; _ ^ When laughing
Europe	LOCATION	vainly would escape Yankee sublime , refulgent in red tape .

		Might not the torch that fired the Ephesian Dome Be well employed -- a little nearer home ? ''

		And
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	himself might have signed the following : '' Enough for us , our earthly errand run .

		To pass an untithed purse from sire to son .

		Too modest to bestow lest men appland , ' ' Faith just too feeble to invest with God , Just zeal sufficient to shun godless knowledge .

		And just too little to endow a College . ''

		About three years ago we had occasion to say a few appreciative words al -RRB- out a slender book of '' Gedichte '' by Mr.
George Sylvester Viereck	PERSON	.

		The author , a German - American youth of twentj - , seemed to exhibit an unusual degree of talent , both for versi - fication and for imaginative effect .

		Since that time , he has been rather conspicuously advertised , and his name has come to mean something to our English-speaking public .

		He now reveals himself as a bilingual poet by publishing a volimie -- • '
Nineveh	LOCATION	, and Other Poems '' -- which reproduces the `` Gedichte '' in English garb , and supplements them bv a number of new pieces .

		Despite the note of sensuality only too apparent in these compositions , they are remarkable productions , and we trust that their licentiousness illustrates what will prove but a 92 THE DIAL -LSB- AuguBt 16 , passing phase of their writer 's expression .

		As it is , they suggest such poets an
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	and
Arthur Symons	PERSON	in their most morbid vein , and this is not a suggestion to be aimed at by a poet who hopes to be taken in a spirit of high seriousness .

		In the lines called '' Nineveh '' we are given the poet 's image of the great city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The following stanzas end the poem : '' I , too , the fatal harvest gained Of them that sow with seed of fire In passion 's garden -- I have drained The goblet of thy sick desire . ''

		I from thy love had bitter bliss , And ever in my memory stir The after-savours of thy kiss -- The taste of aloes and of myrrh . ''

		And yet I love thee , love unblessed The poison of thy wanton 's art ; Though thou be sister to the Pest In thy great hands I lay my heart ! ''

		And when thy body Titan-strong Writhes in its giant couch of sin , Yea , though upon the trembling throng The very vault of Heaven fall in ; '' And though the palace of thy feasts Sink crumbling in a fiery sea -- I , like the last of
Baal	ORGANIZATION	's priests .

		Will share thy doom , O Nineveh . ''

		We can not help recalling to what noble purpose another youthful poet , some fifty years ago , moral - ized upon the burden of his
Nineveh	LOCATION	, the metropolis of our mother-country .

		Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	's garden seems thus far to have grown fleurs du mat for the most part ; if he were to replant it with roses , or even with turnips , he would be well-advised .

		The inspi - ration of
Dowson	PERSON	and
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, of Baudelaire and
Verlaine	PERSON	, is neither vitalizing nor wholesome .

		But there are in Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	's pages some indica - tions of a nobler mood than derives from the ex - ample of such writers as have just been named , and he appeals to us far more deeply with his sonnet '' Friendship '' than with all the riotous imagery of his * ' Ballad of Sin '' or the affected satiety of his '' Sphinx '' poems . ''

		Lo , in my hour of need I called on thee .

		Asking thy friendship 's none too heavy toll ; Comrades were we when I was glad and whole .

		And yet thou cam ` st not , and at last I see
Twain	PERSON	are the ways of friendship , and there be One that laughs with us o'er the fragrant bowl , And one that wanders with the troubled soul In the great silence of
Gethsemane	LOCATION	. ''

		I can forgive , and while glad days abound Thou shalt be with me ; but when
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	flings The rose-leaf and tlie wine-cup to the ground , Then would I call upon the heart that hears With intimate love the depth of human things .

		The eye that knows the sanctity of tears . ''

		Says Mr.
William Ellery Leonard	PERSON	at the outset of his poems , '' I would make mention of primeval things . ''

		An illustration of the fulfilment of this purpose may be found in '' Mens Immortalis . '' ''

		I am the
Lord of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	and Hell ; I reign King from the blue void to dim gulfs below ; My counsellers were gathered long ago From conquered hosts of pleasure and of piun .

		And when at sanction of their .

		suzerain They speak the wisdom only they can know .

		My just decrees work thrift or overthrow Throughout my old and eminent domain .

		I plant the mountain where I laid the plain .

		Create the seas .

		md suns of afterglow .

		Call the great thunder and the wild , slant rain .

		And rear me shrines for worship or for show -- Destroying all , when , for my growth and gain , I wish new worlds to rise , new winds to blow . ''

		The combined intellectuality and austere restraint of these lines well exemplify the character of Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	's `` Sonnets and Poems '' -- some fifty son - nets and some score of other pieces .

		Nature means a great deal more to this poet than a mere decorative background for human life .

		She is a solace for grief , since '' When storms are done , The wet leaves sparkle on the mountain tree ; The gold clouds lie about the setting sun ; The blue waves roll their white crests in from sea ; The gentle stars mount heaven one by one With ancient light , as now they mount to me , '' and she is an unfailing source of strength , for • ' StiU , Tho ' we have glossed anew the psalmist 's verse .

		Our help shall come from out the ancient hiU , And we shall promise largely and fulfil , Feeling , as heroes , our unconquered will , Part of the epic of the universe I '' Sometimes the author 's joy in nature is touched with a note of indignation , as in the lines suggested by a rumored sale of the
White Mountains	LOCATION	to a lumber company . ''

		We traffic with our birthright : our domain Of torrents thundering inland shall be dumb -- We have sold our cataracts to turn our mills ; And having lifted up our eyes in vain .

		Whence our help cometh , but no more may come ; Now we would sell the everlasting hills ! ''

		These sonnets tempt us to much further quotation .

		Their technique is remarkable for several things , for precision and verbal economy , for rhythmical balance and sonerous culmination .

		We can not alto - gether approve of the sort of ruhato trick whereby the sestet is frequently shortened by half a line in the interests of the octave , but perhaps this is an article in the author 's creed of revolt against '' the marble order , the preciser creed '' of academic versifiers .

		The poems in other than the sonnet-form include some fine specimens of blank verse , among which the paraphrases of Heraclitus and Empedocles are noteworthy , as are also the lines on '' The Cloud , '' dedicated with '' reverent love '' to the spirit of Shelley .

		Mr.
Peter McArthur	PERSON	is a thoughtful poet , although his inspiration is apt to be a little tame .

		Occasion - ally , as in this sonnet on '' Silence , '' he makes a high imaginative flight :
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		93 • • Beyond the reach of sun or wandering star , In that deep cincture of eternal night , That shronds and stays this orbid flare of light Where many a god hath wheeled bis griding car , Silence is brooding , patient and afar .

		Secure and steadfast in his primal right .

		Reconquering slowly , with resistless might .

		Dominions lost in immemorial war .

		The throng ^ suns are paling to their doom , The constellations waver , and a breath Shall blur them all into eternity ; Then Ancient Silence in oblivious gloom Shall reign -- where holds this dream of
Time	ORGANIZATION	and Death Like some brief bnbble in a shoreless sea . ''

		Sometimes the verse is in a lighter vein , illustrated by these stanzas ' • To the Birds '' : '' How dare you sing such cheerful notes ?

		Yon show a woful lack of Caste ; How dare vou poor from happy throats Such merry songs with raptured haste .

		While all our poets wail and weep , And readers sob themselves to sleep ?

		■ ■ Tis clear to me .

		you 've never read The turgid tomes that
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	writes .

		Nor mourned with
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	virtue dead .

		Nor over
Howells	LOCATION	pored o ' nights : For you are glad with all your power ; For shame !

		Go study
Schopenhauer	PERSON	. ''

		We fear that ilr .

		McArthur himself has not read his Ibsen : if he had , so gpx > tesquely inaccurate a phrase as '' turgid tomes '' could hardly have been used as a description of the plays .

		Beginning with a g ^ roup of classical idyls , and ending with a Christmas mystery , Mr
John Erskine	PERSON	's • * Act `` on and Other Poems '' offers a series of poet - ical exercises , wholly derivative in merit , and of slight significance .

		The stanzas called • ' Parting '' arrest the eye for a moment -- they at least express a clean-cut thought , and express it prettily .

		■ '' Not in thine absence , nor when face To face , thy love means most to me .

		But in the short-lived parting-space .

		The cadence of felicity .

		■ ■ So music 's meaning first is known .

		Not while the bird sings all day long , But when the last faint-falling tone Divides the silence from the song . ''

		Mr.
Louis Ledonx	PERSON	informs us that his '' Song is from a heart That tracking orbM Beauty through the world With ardor undismayed , self-consecrate To follow where the quest may lead , though strange And perilous the pathway be , but finds Illusive gleams , ineffable desire . ''

		His book is called '' The Soul 's Progress , and Other Poems . ''

		more than half of it being occupied by the poem thus named , which is a group of lyrics descrip - tive of the journey of the soul '' through the realm of emotion . ''

		These verses , for example , voice the mood of '' Youth '' : '' I sing the joy of the wind-swept woods .

		The joy of the sunlit sky , The joy of the solemn solitudes Where the stars bum clear on high ; '' For life is a joyous song of Love , Of Beauty and Delight .

		And human souls in cadence move With a hymn of noon and night . ''

		Mr.
Witter Bynner	PERSON	has concocted • • An Ode to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	'' which records the impressions of a gTAduaie revisiting his Alma Mater in after years .

		It is a lengthy composition of jocose patter , lacking in both dignit -RCB- - and restraint .

		The miscellaneous poems which fill the latter -LRB- and lesser -RRB- half of his volume make a somewhat better impression , although their artistic quality remains inconsiderable .

		The last poem of aU , '' Over the Hills , '' seems to be the best , and we quot `` it entire . ''

		Over the hills to climb and flee .

		And let no heart be braver !

		And when they arise like waves of the aek O like a bird of the sea to be -- Over the hills forever I '' Over the hills to find content .

		To loee the gall and sorrow Of letting life and love be spent For happiness that came and went , Or may not come to-morrow . ''

		Over the bills hide half-miknowB High haunts of starry cover ; O to steal out in the
night	TIME	, alone With one close-clasp 'd whose hair is blown -- And be the perfect lover !

		** Over the hills at last to know The soul of some deep river I -- And sweet in the fields to rest and grow .

		And swift in the winds to rise and blow -- Over the hills forever I '' If the author 's habitual flight were as high as this , he would be by way of becoming a poet .

		Mr.
Edward Gilchrist	PERSON	's '' Tiles from the
Porce	LOCATION	- lain Tower '' are the lyrics of a reflective mind , but their flow is far from mtisical -- a defect due in part to the frequent collocation of Ul-matched vocables , and in part to the fact that the movement is too much clogged with ideas .

		We select for quotation ' `` A Floral Calendar , '' having for emblems of the four seasons the arbutus , the rose , the cardinal-flower , and the goldenrod .

		This is the first stanza : '' Hail and farewell .

		Sweet blossom nurtured in the anow That doth compel Hiy shape with its star-crystals ere they go !

		Thou caUest Spring Back from the sealM sepulchre of earth .

		Yet diest witnessing her strange new birth When the first robins sing O'er broken shell .

		Hail , raayflower ' .

		Farewell I '' The final stanza runs as follows : ' * Hail and farewell .

		All blessed saints of floral calendar !

		Now in the cell And catacomb of bitter days ye are : But pagan frost Of persecution shall not long prevail ,
Winter	DATE	and Death are Knights who hring the Grail That we need last and most , -- Sleep 's qnick ` ning spell .

		Hail , flowers !

		Hail and farewell ! ''

		94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, A few translations from the Greek , the Danish , the Russian , and the Chinese are appended to Mr.
Gil	PERSON	- christ 's original vei-ses .

		A little gi'oup of volumes from
San Francisco	LOCATION	, containing matter new and old , now claims our attention .

		The smallest of them , but by no means the least significant , is ''
Hathor	PERSON	, '' the work of
Stanly Coghill	PERSON	, a young writer who died recently .

		The friend who contributes a prefatory note by way of a memorial tells us that the poems are '' the over - tone of a strangely beautiful soul that was always seeking for a half-remembered and perhaps , in this world at least , unattainable glory . ''

		We quote the titular poem . ''

		From what far gulf of
Time	ORGANIZATION	hath she arisen To haunt me with her spirit beauty now ?

		How hath she crossed the fathomless abysm , The olden glory on her face and brow ?

		* ' Does she yet know how once I did adore her In that far land where the old river flows ?

		Remembers she how there I knelt before her And crowned her witli the lotus and the rose ' . ' ''

		The rose the symbol of her deathless beauty .

		The lotus of her fateful spells tlie sign .

		Of charms that lured ns from the paths of duty , Of love that poured forth blood as free as wine ? ''

		Remembers she the temple by the river , The line of white-robed priests that by her passed , The deathless adoiation we did give her , The longing looks of love toward her cast ? ''

		And sees she one upon the pylon kneeling , Watching the white moon sweep across the sky ?

		Heara she the wild and agonized appealing , The prayers to look upon her face and die ? ''

		Hears she the murmur of the ancient river , A-flowing , crooning thro ' the Nihis reeds , And wonders she if he can yet forgive her Who slew his people and his ancient creeds ' . ' ''

		Regrets she e'er the olden love still flies us .

		And new Gods rule us in the old Gods ' stead ?

		Hates she the grim
Time Spirit	ORGANIZATION	who defies us .

		And sweeps away the memory of the dead ? ''

		This little book is distinctly worth while .

		It.s ideas are mostly echoes , and it is too much tinged with the melancholy in which youth is apt to revel , but it has harmony , and flowing rhythm , and something of the historical imagination , Mr ,
Louis Alexander Robertson	PERSON	's ' ■ Through Painted Panes , and Other Poems '' consists mainly of matter reprinted from earlier volumes , the plates of which were destroyed in the great fire .

		But the chant royal of the dedicatory '' Resurgam '' is clearly one of the new pieces , and from it we take the opening stanza .

		■ ' The cataclysmal force to which we owe Our glorious
Gate of Gold	ORGANIZATION	, through which the sea Rushed in to clasp these shores long , long agt > , Came once again to crown our destiny With such a grandeur tliat in sequent years This period of pain which now appears Pregnant with doubt , shall vanish a.s when day Drives the foreboding dreams of night away .

		Born of the womb of Woe , where Sorrow sighs , Fostered by Faith , undaunted by Dismay ,
Earth	LOCATION	's fairest City shall from ashes rise . ''

		Dr
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	, whose civic honors are still fresh in the memory , ha.s put forth a new edition of his translation of '' Les Troph ^ as , '' and a new volume of '' Selected Poems . ''

		It is now ten years since his first version of the sonnets of Heredia appeared , and by dint of much polishing , the work is given , in its present fourth edition , what is likely to remain its final shape .

		Readei-s of poetry have much reason to thank Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	for the loving pains with which he has given them this highly acceptable translation of
Heredia	ORGANIZATION	's finely-chiselled poems .

		Concerning Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	's own '' Selected Poems , '' which fill a handsome volume of one hun - dred and sixty pages , we have to note that most of the pieces are reprinted from volumes the plates of which were destroyed in the fire .

		And , as in the case of Mr.
Robei-tson	PERSON	, we may safely choose a `` an example of the hitherto unpublished work the following sonnet on the diaster which supplied
San Francisco	LOCATION	with a new era from which to reckon her chronology : ' ■ Dawn scarce had lit tlie torch of smiling day When quaked the earth as witli convulsive fear And palsying horror , till , both far and near , Death 's trurapeta blared where ruin 's wreckage lay .

		Then Fire demoniac raged along its way On flame-wreathed pinions , hurtling spear on spear Of direful doom , while still the strangely drear , Calm sun shone on with blood-encrim .

		soned ray .

		And Devastation through the waste did stride With glut so sated , that it truly seemed His cup of joy could hold not one drop more .

		But in her fine magnificence of pride St ,
Francis	PERSON	' child blenched not , but greatly dreamed Of nobler , grander glories than before . '' '

		This sonnet is the first of a series of six , all impres - sive in imagery and stately in diction .

		The other sec - tions of the book , all bearing more or less directly on Positivism , have already appeared in various periodicals , except the concluding forms of service -LRB- burial , marriage , initiation , etc. -RRB- used by himself as president of the society worshiping at

		His presentation of the claims of `` the religion of humanity , '' full and satis - fying as it is to thinkers of like mind with himself , will not content those who can not find complete rest and comfort in holding with him that '' religion is summed up in Duty , and duty implies fellow-men --

		Here is morality , it is true , but not suf - ficiently tinged with emotion to satisfy every heart .

		The same objection that he urges against pantheism as the worship of a vague absti-action , and the same reasoning that makes him see poetry but not religion in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's ''
TiDtern Abbey	ORGANIZATION	'' will operate in many minds to discredit '' humanity '' as an object of worship because of its failure to meet the demand for a pei-sonal deity .

		Yet everyone who has thought deeply on religion , and its relation to science and to practical life , must take delight in the clear thinking and the intellectual honesty of one who was early '' saved from those two intellectual curses of oui - age : fii-st , a pedantic specialism which limits students to a single group of laws and debilitates the whole mind ; secondly , from the presmuptuous foUy of attempting to settle ultimate principles by vague hypotheses and so-called intuitions , without even an elementary conception of true physical law .

		He gave his name to
Clerkenwell	LOCATION	, a certain locality of
London	LOCATION	.

		He took a prominent part in the mystery plays of his day .

		His duties and his rights have fi'om time to time been defined by law , ecclesiastical and civil .

		He was the choir leader , the representative of the people in the responsive services of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, often the sexton , and quite as frequently the mentor of the clerg -RRB- - man .

		He might otherwise be a useful member of the community in which he lived in the pursuit of some other calling , -- as parish-school teacher , cobbler , or stone-cutter .

		Either he was a man of little education with a genius for mispro - nouncing many of the words of the Church service , or else the parish clerks of a better sort have failed to leave any impress upon the life and traditions of the English communities .

		He was of such impor - tance in
London	LOCATION	in the thirteenth and subsequent centuries that a Parish Clerks ' Company was duly registered at

		He relates many entertaining stories of the vagaries of the Parish , Clerk , but concludes with the suggestion that the office be restored to its former functions and that the effort be made to obtain more learned and able men for the discharge of the duties , and that the office be made a sphere of training for those who wish to take holv ordei-s .

		-LRB- gcribner -RRB- is an attempt to induce visitors of picture galleries to adjust tlieu - judgments by taking into consideration certain matters likely to be ignored .

		For example , all of the old masterpieces now on exhibition in public gfalleries are in a foreign environment , uncongenial to their original state with respect to lighting , framing , distance , etc. ; most of them have been either restored or repainted ; very many are wrongly atti-ibuted or copies , sometimes forgeries ; their original meaning is frequently quite obsolete for the mo < lern mind .

		All the Madonnas and
Magdalens	PERSON	and Dianas of the Italian painters , all their portraits of lords and ladies , belong to a by-gone age ; our sympathy with their subjects can go Uttle further than an atlmiration for a ^ pe or a liking for a sentiment .

		But though the subjects be obsolete , the skill of the artist still lives , the work - manship of the pictures is still of vital interest .

		The teaching of the Sistine Ma < lonna , or the story in
Botticelli 's Spring	ORGANIZATION	, niay and do slip away ; but the figures , the colors , the workmanship endure .

		To study these , to regard art from the artist 's point of view as something beautiful , decorative , appropriate , attractive in itself apart from any meaning symbolic or otherwise , -- this is what the real study of pictures means .

		To help the reader toward this end .

		Pro- fessor
Van Dyke	ORGANIZATION	devotes Part I. of his simply-written and entertaining book .

		In Part II .

		we liave chapters on figure-painting , portrait-painting , ffenre painting , the animal in art , landscape and marine painting , which bring the subject down to modern times and living artists .

		Forty full-page half-tones are well chosen to illustrate the text .

		A Irafiedv of anti-Sfmititm `` Why do human beings hurt one another so ? ''

		is the unanswerable question that closes Dr.
Max Nordau	PERSON	's four-act tragedy , '' A Question of Honor , '' which was published in Gei-man nine years ago under the title • • Doctor
Kohn	PERSON	, '' and is now translated by Miss
Mary • J. SafEord	PERSON	and issued to the English-reading public by
Messrs. John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		With too little action and variety for successful stage production , the piece is a moving picture of that form of race - hatred known as anti-Semitism .

		Of Jewish extrac - tion himself , the author has wTitten feelingly and with first-hand knowledge of that whereof he speaks .

		The plot of the play is briefly this : Dr.
Kohn	PERSON	, a Jew , -- a talented PrivatdocerU -LRB- not quite accurately translated '' ` private tutor '' -RRB- , more
Gentile	PERSON	than Jew in his faith , or want of faith , and in all his habits and associations , -- falls in love with a girl of ostensibly Teutonic parentage , but really half-Jewish herself 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, through her father , a Hebrew who has renounced his race and religion and changed his name .

		All might have gone smoothly , on the surface at least , had the lover been willing to embrace Christianity ; but he honorably refused to profess a faith that had never commended itself to his acceptance , or to dis - own a name and an origin that he felt it no shame to avow .

		The heroine remains true to him , even though all her relatives except her father turn against her .

		The hero , insulted beyond endurance by her brother , demands satisfaction , and falls on the duelling field , after firing his pistol into the air .

		Thoroughly German in its details of university life and of social and family intercourse , the play is manifestly a hard one to turn into idiomatic English that shall not violate `` local color '' ; and though the translator has done well , in a few places she might have done bet - ter .

		For instance ,
Frau Moser	PERSON	, surprised by some - thing her husband has done , exclaims , `` I do not recognize you , '' meaning of course , `` that was not like you . ''

		The play is excellent reading , and offers food for thought .

Cram	PERSON	.

		Those in the present collection are mainly a discussion of ecclesiastical architecture from the Gothic standpoint , or , rather , from the standpoint of the English High Church .

		Formalism and ritual - ism seem to hold as high a place in Christian art , to Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's mind , as do form and abstract beauty in art generally .

		The purpose is so evident in these chapters , and the literary expression is so lost in emphasizing the point , that the charm of certain other of Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's writings is missing here .

		There is meat in the essays , and good reading for the non `` Beaux '' artists , as well as what might be whole - some reading for them .

		In Mr.
Crani	PERSON	's architectiu-al work , as in his literature , there is an avowed leaning to the English ; but his power of selection is finer in his architectm-e , -- at least it seems to us , who admire and sympathize with his work , -- than in his literary form .

		It is hard to account for the frequent occur - ence of the phrase '' different to '' in the writing of a born .

		New Englander ; there are sweeter draughts to be drawn at the font of '' English pm-e and unde - liled . ''

		But , after all criticism of form and matter , one must feel that what underlies the volume should be known and appreciated by every individual or committee or congregation interested in the building of a Christian shrine , or house of worship , or temple .

		A chapter on
Architectural Education	ORGANIZATION	is good read - ing for architect or layman .

		The
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		have published the volume in attractive form .

		A final edition ^ he third and concluding volume `` /
America	LOCATION	's of `` The Poems of
Philip Freneau	PERSON	, earliest poet .

		p ^ gj „ f jjjg American Revolution '' -LRB-
The University Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	, N. J. -RRB- , of which Volume I. was reviewed in The Dial of
June 16 , 1903	DATE	, has now appeared .

		It contains the poems written between
1790	DATE	and
1815	DATE	, a quarter-century in which many things happened .

		Freneau was a keen though by no means impartial observer of European as well as of American affairs , and re - corded his thoughts in verse so freely that this vol - ume may be said to form a running commentary on the entire period .

		There are several spirited jwems on the French Revolution ; and in his remarks on the War of
1812	DATE	, Freneau still wields the same biting weapon with which he had scourged the Tories of an earlier day .

		The volume concludes with a list of poems -LRB- 119 titles -RRB- which , for various reasons -LRB- in only one instance for coarseness alone -RRB- , it has seemed wise not to reprint ; a bibliography of
Freneau	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , based on Mr.
Paltsits	PERSON	's more elab - orate volume of
1903	DATE	, which it corrects in some details and sujjplements ; and a good index to the whole work .

		The editor .

		Professor
Pattee	PERSON	, is to be congratulated upon the very satisfactory appearance of this definitive edition of
America	LOCATION	's first poet . ''

		Hezekiah Salem '' -LRB- as Freneau , a born fighter , frequently signed himself in
1809	DATE	-RRB- deserves to be something more than a mere name in histories of our literature , and will now become better known .

		He was far from gi'eat ; but it is something to have portrayed so faithfully and so fully that spirit which defied
King George	PERSON	, and which laid the foundations of the Republic , -- and who shall say how much his stirring verse helped to do these things ?

		The life of an ^ ^ e puzzle of Lady
Mary Wortley	PERSON	18th centurv
Montagu	ORGANIZATION	's character -- whether she letter-writer .

		^ ^ g -LRB- ^ -RCB- , g vk ` anton profligate that Pope 's shameless satire would have us believe , or the virtu - ous matron her own letters to husband and daughter seem to indicate -- is not solved by Mr.
George Paston	PERSON	's `` Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	and hei ' Times '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , nor is the exact cause of her quarrel with the peppery little poet determined ; but the book is the first , as it may well enough suffice for the last , detailed and painstaking recital of all that diligent research can find to say about this remarkable woman .

		Other lives of her we have in some abundance , but they are mostly in the form of prefatory memoirs prefixed to her works , and do not compare in fulness with Mr.
Paston	PERSON	's 559-page octavo .

		He has had access to '' four or five hun - dred unpublished letters '' to and from the
Wortley Montagus	PERSON	, and has also drawn upon Lady
Mary	PERSON	's unpublished fragment of an autobiography .

		Numer - ous portraits are of course pi'ovided ; there was no lack of these to choose from .

		The appended list of Lady
Mary	PERSON	's works faUs to mention her chief claim to literary fame , her letters , of which so many , both genuine and spurious , have been published that a bibliographical survey of the subject would have
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 been in order .

		It is because of her lettei-s almost exclusively that we now feel much interest in
Lady Mary	ORGANIZATION	, and in her letters from
Constantinople	LOCATION	we have the best of her .

		The creed Taking the tenets of
Karl Mai-x	PERSON	as of Orthodox a point of departure , Mr.
J. Edward Socialism	PERSON	.


Lg Rossignol	ORGANIZATION	.

		in his `` Orthodox Socialism '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , presents a critical study of the socialistic theory in its most rigid form .

		The doctrines of the English Classical School -- the corner-stone , as it were , upon which socialism was built -- are examined and their inconsistencies noted .

		A student of socialistic theories as well as an astute observer of facts , Mr.
Le Rossignol	PERSON	perceives the fallacies of 8ociali .

		sm and flagrantly exposes them .

		He shows how the basic principle of Marxian pliilos - ophy -- the economic interpretation of history -- cnimbles away under
Marx	PERSON	's assertion that there will be an - ` era of perfect peace . ''

		Furthermore , he sees slight gi-ound for predicting that this social - istic era -- economically disastrous , as he believes -- will ever be realized .

		Mr.
Le Rossignol	PERSON	makes his points skilfully , but one must bear in mind that in his small volume he in no way attempts to con - sider the position of the ' '' opportunists , '' a large sect of less radical socialists .

		In his pertinent discussion of ' `` orthodox '' socialism , however , he is convincing in his conclusion that it is as yet '' but a faith , not a Notes .

		NOTES 124 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 125 A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF SHAKESPEARE 'S PLAYS .

		What joy to write of Shakespeare !

		To deal with him is like clipping into the
Fountain of Youth	ORGANIZATION	and rising renewed and resplendent .

		It is said of
Rossetti	PERSON	that he never tired of anyone who could talk to him of
Keats	PERSON	.

		No reiteration of critical comment can weary the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	- lover .

		He can read the driest gossip that has to do with his god , he can sit out the fiftieth hearing of one of the plays .

		Merely to recite to himself the names of the plays , to call the roll of his favorite characters , to let the music and picture of the verse steal over his mind , is like holding up to his eye jewel after jewel from an Orient casket -- ruby , diamond , emerald , and pearl -- and watching the flash and sparkle and play of color ; it is like walking in the garden of
Alcinous	LOCATION	, where apple succeeded apple and pear succeeded pear , and blossom and fruit were on the branch at once .

		For
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is not only himself alone .

		The intellect of the world has been squandered upon him for centuries .

		He has , as it were , robbed generation after generation to add t '' his own store .

		Think of the critics who have come from all four quarters of the globe , bearing their gifts of honey or spices to lay at his feet I Think of the artists and illustrators whose embodi - ments , whether successful or not , are r ^ ged tier beyond tier in our minds !

		Think of the players , at once the best critics and best illustrators of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, whose melody of voice , whose state - liness or beauty or charm of person , are inex - tricably blent in our memories with the poetry itself I Our thought of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is truly a complex of association .

		It is more for mere delight in dealing with the subject , than with any hope of unearthing a critical treasure-trove , that some suggestions are ventured as to the classification of the plays .

		A chronological arrangement , if it could be got at , would be the ideal one , as showing the devel - opment of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	`` s mind and art .

		But that is not to be hoped for .

		The ordinary division , into comedies , histories , and tragedies , is crude enough .

		Some of the plaj 's classed as comedies are thoroughly tragic ; and there are many of mixed species .

		Why not let them pair and group 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	into families , according to their inward charac - teristics ?

		Mates and natural companions would suit and set each other off better than if sep - arated by intruding and discordant pieces .

		There are , first , the two farces , '' The Comedy of Errors '' and '' The Taming of the Shi-ew . ''

		Barring the
Christopher Sly	PERSON	framework of the latter piece , which is in his richest natural vein , these plays are like nothing else of
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was trying his hand at the Latin or Italian type of comedy ; and while they are mechanical to a degree compared with his other work , they have immense skill and vivacity and theatrical life .

		Then there are the two comedies of fancy , '' The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	'' and '' Love 's Labour 's Lost , '' -- the first , boyish , gentle , tame , but with gleams of the truest humor and with the unfolded buds of half of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's gar - den of comedy in it ; the second , the vei-y riot of youthful wit and imagination and feeling .

		Tennyson 's '' Princess '' is the modern analogue of '' Love 's Labour 's Lost , '' and , though rich and elaborate , has little of the vividness and reality and headlong high spirits of the older work .

		Next come
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's great plays of pure humor and wit .

		There is the dazzling '' Much Ado about Nothing , '' which , though with a sheen of poetry over it , and even a sudden open - ing abyss of passion , is yet predominantly humor - ous .

		Then there ai-e the two parts of ''
Henry IV.	PERSON	, '' with their scenes of heroism and war and statecraft serving as a mere foil to the more important adventures of Falstaff .

		And there is the '' Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	, '' where that incarnation of Original Evil , that projection of the irresponsible part of humanity , wallows about like Behemoth in a sea too small for him .

		Cleon ,
Miles Gloriosus , Trimalchio	ORGANIZATION	,
Panurge	LOCATION	,
Sancho Panza	PERSON	, and their later descendants
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	and
Micawber	PERSON	, all creep ^ long in fiction imder the shadow of the mighty bidk of Falstaff . ''

		Twelfth Night '' and '' As You Like It '' form a separate species of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work -- the species of poetic hmnor ; and they are alone in their kind in literature .

		Aristophanes beats
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in airy inventiveness , as in `` The Birds '' and `` The Clouds . ''

		Rabelais rivals him in the comedy of wisdom -- the sage 's look behind the grotesque mask .

		Cervantes and St `` rne equal him in the humor of contrasts ;
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	surpasses him in cool social satire .

		But for poetry , romance , passion , tenderness , wit , humor , fun , all blended together into an intoxi - cating draught of happiness , there is nothing like these two plays .

		They are the top and crown of the whole world 's work in comedy .

		And , as being unique , we could almost have the heart to declare them
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's master - pieces .

		For in tragedy the world may produce sometliing to equal his best , as indeed it has done in the past ; but it is improbable that any - one will ever again recover the Golden Age as it is embodied in these two plays .

		In the two comedies of the imagmation , '' The Tempest '' and '' A Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' we are on the turn of the tide which is to sweep us toward great and serious poetry .

		Comedy abounds in both ; but the latter piece is an ironic , not a real , ^ presentation of life , and in '' The Tempest '' the deep gi-ave notes of poetry boom like surf on a sunny day , advertis - ing one of shipwreck and death .

		As anyone who has seen Miss
Russell	PERSON	's recent production of '' A Midsummer Night 's Dream '' can realize , that piece is a view of human life seen from
Fairyland	LOCATION	.

		The fairies ai'e the sane and rea - sonable personages , the men and women the incongTuous and absurd ones . ''

		Cymbeline '' and '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' have always been called romances , and there is no better name for them ; only I woidd add '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' and ''
Romeo	PERSON	and Jidiet '' to the gi-ouj -RCB- .

		In aU , the serious , if not tragic , interest prevails , and in all there is a rich vividness in the outward setting and a tumultuous passion in the life portrayed , which is different from anything in the comedies .

		The sunlight is stronger and the shadows are deeper . ''

		The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' is the more multi - form and many-colored .

		It is like a bed of tiger-lilies , which in the end blanch out into pure white . ''

		Romeo and Juliet '' is the most intense in feeling and most single in action of all
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		It leaps on like flash after flash of lightning , almost intolerably dazzling and splendid .

		`` The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' handicapped by a bad story in the beginning , and divided into two parts , only recovers itself as a poem in
the second half	DATE	, where the pastoral scenes and pomp of festival and
Perdita	PERSON	s charm lift it to a high level .

		Yet the earlier action is more theatrically effective .

		In reading the play , one almost pities Shakespeare for such an obvious '' god from the machine '' device as the oracle .

		But the thing is triumphantly powerfid on the stage .

		We are all agreed about the central character and central scenes of '' Cym - beline . ''

		Nothing in Shakespeare touches the imagination and the heart more deeply than
Imogen	PERSON	's adventurous flight and seeming death ^
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJ ^ 109 There is a group of four pieces which might be named the satire plays .

		It consists of * ' All 's Well that Ends Well , '' '' Measure for Meas - ure , '' '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' and '' Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		No other play is so hard to place in this arranjrement as the first of these .

		It is highly romantic in the figure of the heroine , but
Bertram	PERSON	and Parolles are dealt with in the spirit of unsparing satire . ''

		Measure for Measure '' is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's grimmest work .

		Earth 's blackness and earth 's decay pervade it , with one figure of the purest light moving about amid its bagnios and prisons and charnel - houses .

		* ' Troilus and Cressida '' is Shake - speare 's one great parody .

		After spending his life in celebrating gi-eatness and beauty and truth and honor , he turned in inexplicable dis - gust to strike at everything he believetl in .

		In '' Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	'' he followetl the Lucianic work so closely that the play has less originality than anything he did .

		He added a scenic splendor and fuhiess to the bare Greek dialogue , and to the later speeches of the great misan - thrope gave a power and majesty of scorn which makes all other satire seem tame and hollow .

		The foiu '' great tragedies of power and pas - sion , ' -
Lear	PERSON	, ' `` Hamlet , '' `` Macbeth , '' and '' OtheUo , '' have always been recognized as iso - lated in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work , the equal and domi - nating peaks of his moimtain range . ''

		OtheUo '' seems decidedly inferior to the other three in power and interest .

		Yet its theme -- the con - test of Good and Evil , which is the central idea of most religions -- has probably never been so clearly and strongly embodied .

		In '' Faust '' there is really no struggle of oppo - nents , for the German Doctor is at heart as bad as his familiar , and
Marguerite	PERSON	is weak .

		In
Milton	LOCATION	, the moi-al principle has somehow got twisted , and we sympathize with the brave and noble Devil .

		In the
Hindoo Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	, with its contest between
Kama	ORGANIZATION	and
Ravana	LOCATION	over the pure and beautiful
Sita	ORGANIZATION	, the theme is set forth powerfully , though with less concentration than in '' OtheUo . ' ''

		Perhaps the reason for the slight coldness I feel towards '' OtheUo '' -- I know not if anyone else shares it -- is that the piece is too painful , too pathetic .

		The misfortunes of the gootl characters are undeserved , are brought about by their frankness , trustfulness , and nobiUty .

		Lear 's fate is largely due to his own temper , and his ruin is demanded for the exhi - bition of the utmost grandeur of human char - acter .

		Macbeth and his wife only get their come-uppanee .

		And I defy anyone to pity Hamlet of the kingly mien and mind .

		But we must say '' Poor OtheUo ! '' ''

		Poor Desdemona ! '' ''

		The pity of it '' is predominant in our minds .

		The three Roman plays we shoidd denomi - nate scenical tragedies .

		Shakespeare 's mind does not seem thoroughly at home in the Roman world of law and form .

		He was , indeed , Uke a mountain , which has one side facing the north , lit by gray skies or the mystic glamor of the moon , with prodigious precipices , with glaciers , with impenetrable forests ; but whose other side slopes gently to the south and to the sun , and shows fields and vineyards and tem - ples and peopled towns .

		But it was the Greek or later Italian life of the South with which he was in sympathy , -- a life whose ideals were Uberty and leisui-e , art and love .

		Roughly speaking , it may be said that nobody works in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		Warriors and statesmen , of course , there are ; but most of his characters are technically ladies and gentlemen .

		If tradesmen or handicraftsmen are introduced , they are treated with a good deal of contempt .

		The i harsh Roman world of duty and discipline did I not much inspire him .

		It did not inspire the I Roman poets .

		So it foUows that , good as ''
Cori	PERSON	- !

		olanus '' and '' JuUus Caesar '' ' are ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's one triumphant achievement in this field is in ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra . ''

		The Greek queen -- that colossal coiui `` san who took in empires for a night 's caress -- is studied with loving care and portrayetl with supreme success .

		The inferiority of historic to legendary or freely invented material for literary creation is iUustrated in the chronicle plays which remain to be noted .

		With the exception of two or three of the comedies , they are the least valuable of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Only two of them , indeed , -- and those the two in which legend has the most part , ''
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		and ''
Henry V.	PERSON	'' -- possess at aU the fused and flaming character of works of art .

		The rest are things of shreds and patches -- splendid shreds and patches indeed , as in the passion of
Constance	PERSON	, the pathos of
Arthur	PERSON	, the superb truculence and truth of
Falconbridge	ORGANIZATION	in ''
King John	PERSON	, '' the character of
Catherine	PERSON	in ``
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, '' and passage upon passage in the three parts of ''
Henry VI	PERSON	. ''

		In '' Riclmrd II . ''

		Shakespeare is beating up against the wind of an unpromising subject -- tacking and veering with great skiU and persistence , but not reaUy arriving anywhere .

		Of the two doubtf id plays , '' Pericles '' is not doubtfid at aU .

		It is authentic Shakespeare in great part , though doubtless patched up with older work .

		The wanderings of the
Prince of Tyre	ORGANIZATION	and the sufferings of his daughter are most 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, affecting , and there is little to wonder at in the popularity of the piece which moved
Ben Jonson	PERSON	to wrath . ''

		Titus Andronicus '' is about as bad a play as was ever written , but that is no reason why it should not have been the work of the youthful
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		That such a mind as his shoidd have come to years of majority without doing anything in verse , is incredible .

		Crude and horrible as the piece is , it has power .

		The young poet who begins with power may go far ; the one who begins with good taste has ah-eady reached the length of his tether .

		It is hardly necessary to say that the order in which the plays are printed does not seem of any particular importance .

		But it is interest - ing to note the resemblances and relationships among them , and to observe the considerable number of groups into which they break up .

		For
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's title to the throne of univer - sal literature rests on his variety .

		He is lord of more domains than any other poet .

		Homer has no humor , no mystery , no romantic idealism .

		- liEschylus is altogether outside of hmnor , almost outside of humanity .

		Dante has a grim wit , but the lighter and kindlier traits of man are hid - den from him ; he is intolerant of two-thirds of human nature .

		And if we turn to the come - dians , they fail in seriousness , in splendor , in beauty .

		But
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's hand is on all the sceptres of aU the rulers of literature .

		Supreme religious ecstasy is the only region where his dominion is not a.ssured ; and he wanders around its borders in constant metaphysical debate and wonder .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The prosperity op the writers of the `` best SELLERS OP THE SEASON '' has moved Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	to epigram .

		He says that in old days the authors died and the books lived ; whUe now the books die and the authors live .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself is so good a writer that his chance of breaking into what he calls the motor-car class in literatui-e must be remote .

		For so delightful a humorist , he is singularly serious .

		He takes the fate of mankind and the follies of society hard .

		The world is too much with him ; like
Atlas	PERSON	, he has it always on his shoulders .

		He has reformed the world , or prophe - sied its dire and hopeless future , in a half-dozen books .

		Fascinating and remarkable as these are , they are so redolent of chemicals , so resonant with the buzzing of machinery , that they repel the or - dinary literary instinct .

		It is
Poe	PERSON	without his profundity ,
Jules Verne	PERSON	without his cheerfulness .

		The tragedy in them is not the tragedy of individ - uals , which the masses always thrill to , -- it is the tragedy of the masses , which only a few individuals can recognize .

		Fortunately for Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's fame , a number of his books are written in a diflPerent mood , under another inspiration .

		There is '' The Wheels of Chance , '' for example .

		One associates this story with Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's '' Queen of Sheba , '' Mr.
HoweUs	PERSON	's '' Lady of the Aroostook , '' and Mr.
Viele	PERSON	's '' Inn of the Silver Moon . ''

		It is more real than any of these , and not less romantic .

		How , in a mere handsbreadth , as it were , of apparently unstudied prose , there can be crowded so much humor , so many clear and glowing vignettes of English scenery , and such a collection of eccentric yet unforced characters is a wonder and a study .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's longest novel , ''
Kipps	PERSON	, '' is a re-handling of the same theme .

		It wants the freshness of the earlier story , but is even more masterly , and has one character at least which is in the ranks of first - class comedy creations .

		But even in this book Mr.
WeUs	PERSON	's social worries rather embarass his art .

		He seems to have an ever-lingering doubt whether in this sorry world he has the right to take joy in his own creative gifts .

		... The GENTLE ART OP EXTRA-ILLUSTEATING , in these days of cheap and numerous process prints , is within the reach of nearly everyone who has taste and time for it .

		A pile of discarded magazines or a dollar 's worth of ''
Perry Pictures	PERSON	, '' with scissors and paste , will furnish means for increasing the value and interest of a shelf-ful of old books -- not new ones , whose immaculate pages and stiff bind - ings deprecate the extra-Ulustrator 's attentions .

		A well-read and preferably somewhat loose-jointed copy of
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' House of Sev ^ n Gables , '' for example , can be turned into a lavishly-illustrated volume by inserting appropriate plates from a ten - cent album of old Salem 's historic scenes .

		Long - fellow 's poems , too , offer material for the exercise of literary-artistic taste and skill .

		An easily obtain - able view of the fine old tree-shaded mansion on East Street in
Pittsfield	LOCATION	where stood the ancient time-piece that ticked out its endless refrain of '' forever -- never !

		never -- forever ! ''

		gives fresh meaning to `` The Old Clock on the Stairs , '' and a penny picture of the
Reef of Norman	ORGANIZATION	's Woe appro - priately illustrates '' The Wreck of the Hesperus . ''

		This is good work for invalids and convalescents ; it helps to hang about the walls of the mind a tap - estry of literary and historic associations , and , inci - dentally , it sometimes proves to be a pecuniarily profitable use of one 's time -- as when some rich collector takes a fancy to some product of the extra - illustrator 's art and pays him a fancy price for it .

		• • • The OPENING OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR is at hand , and presently we shall hear from every side that entering classes are breaking all previous records for size .

		Our continued material prosperity has at least this good feature to it , that it makes possible a larger draughting of youth into the ranks
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		Ill of college stadents . ''

		Nowhere in the world , '' said Ambassador
Bryce	PERSON	in his late address at
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, • ' does there seem to be so large a part of the people that receive a university education as here in
America	LOCATION	.

		The effects of this will no doubt be felt in the coming generation .

		Let us hope they will be felt not only in the complete equipment of your citizens for public life and their warmer zeal for civic progress , but also in a true perception of the essentild elements of happiness , a larger capacity for enjoying those simple pleasures which the culti - vation of taste and imagination opens to us all . ''

		Earlier in the same address , which was entitled , • • What
University Instruction May	ORGANIZATION	do to Provide Intellectual Pleasures for Later Life , '' Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	took occasion to emphasize the need that we increas - ingly feel as we grow older '' to have all the help and inspiration for our own lives that poetry can give .

		Much of everyone 's work is dull and depress - ing , and that escape from dulness which the strain of fierce competition or bold speculation gives is a dangerous resource .

		It is better to feed what I have called the inner life .

		Not all can succeed in life ; none can escape its sorrows .

		He who under disap - pointments or sorrows has no resources within his own command beyond his business life , nothing to which he can turn to cheer or refresh his mind , wants a precious
spring	DATE	of strength and consolation . ''

		Let us hope , then , that out of the multitudes enter - ing college this fall some considerable number will enter for the purpose of feeding the inner life rather than the foot-ball eleven , the boat crew , or the base-ball nine .

		... Who are `` fobeigx authobs '' ?

		is a question forcibly presented by Miss L. H. .

		Soutar , a Scotch - woman , in a recent number of '' The Author '' of
London	LOCATION	.

		In the articles of association of the Society of Authors , the phrase '' English and foreigfn authors '' occurs : and Miss .

		Soutar objects , as do many of her race , to this comprehensive use of the proper adjective . ''

		Like the majority of Scotch and Irish people , '' she writes , ' • !

		feel resentful when our countries and peoples are grouped under the titles of
England	LOCATION	and English .

		If the Incor - porated Society of Authors is a national institution and instituted to assist British authors , then I con - sider there is a lack of correctness in substituting the word English for British . ''

		Reference b then made to some of .


Scotland	LOCATION	's famous writers , who could not properly be included in a list of English authors , but would surely take a high place in a catalogue of British poets and novelists .

		But what are we to do with Irish writers , with
Charles Lever	PERSON	and
Thomas Moore	PERSON	and
Clarence Siangan	PERSON	?

		The people of the
Emerald Isle	ORGANIZATION	would surely never con - sent to be called British , and still less would they care to have all authors of the L'nited Kingdom grouped together under the designation Irish .

		There is Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, too , a Manxman , not to mention the Welsh writers ; what are we to do with them ?

		The ilanchester '' Guardian '' humorously suggests the mouth-filling compound • '
Anglirwelscotmanx	PERSON	' for the literature of the British islands .

		But the term '' English '' will not be driven out ; as well might one object to the use of '' * Roman '' as applied to the ancient empire of that name , or to '' Yankee '' as designating a citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	, The most important or best-known part usurps the pre - rogatives of the whole .

		A curious reverse usage , however , is found in the adjective '' American , '' which is commonly understood as referring to this country .

		... The self-conscioushess ok modeku liteka - TtJKE , its sophisticated , scientific , positive tone , and its individualism , which makes each writer a canon and measure to himself , are somewhat depressingly insisted upon by Mr.
R. A. Scott-James	PERSON	in an En - glish journal .

		He declares at the outset that good criticism , which
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	defined as '' ' a disinterested endeavour to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought in the world , '' can - not now be confined to the limits thus fixed . ''

		For surely , '' he explains , '' you can not possibly know the best until you know something of the worst . ''

		But is that true ?

		One might quote here , without too great irrelevancy , the definition of a good and wise judge in Plato 's '' Republic , '' and the philoso - pher 's conclusion that • ' vice can not know virtue , bat a virtuous nature , educated by time , will acquire knowledge both of virtue and vice . ''

		And this sentiment , as is well enough known , our New En - gland Plato has repeated .

		3Ir .

		ScottnJames main - tains , further , that science has killed superstition , reason strangled fancy , and modern psychology made us introspective and unspontaneous .

		This is true in part but not in so full a sense as to leave us with the barren prospect contemplated by the essayist .

		We are conquering new kingdoms , invad - ing and taking possession of new realms ; yet this extension of our frontiers does not mean that there is to be no terra incognita beyond .

		We still march with it , the only difference being that our boundaries are immensely enlarged .

		The literary outlook was never so richly promising as now .

		From the chaos of contemporary publications , those fit to survive will in time be recognized by that '' high serious - ness '' which Mr.
ScottJ	PERSON	^ ames admires in
Matthew Arnold	LOCATION	, but thinks to be no longer possible in literary criticism .

		... The populab dema : xt > for poetry is admit - tedly small ; hence the satisfaction we take in noting one poet -- not a great poet , perhaps rather a mem - ber of the numerous company of minor poets -- whose works have been in such demand as to neces - sitate their reprinting nearly every year since their collective issue eleven years ago .

		The following letter from Mr.
Alfred Nutt	PERSON	to the
London	LOCATION	`` Press '' is worth reprinting for the encouragement it affords to those that have the cause of poetry at heart '' WiU you allow
Henley	PERSON	's publisher , '' writes Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	'' to state his opinion that public appreciation of his work is far more widespread and deep-seated 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, than the writer of the admirahle leader in your issue of the 1 1th inst .

		is disposed to admit .

		For a certain kind of popularity
Henley	ORGANIZATION	would have had nothing but loathing , equal loathing for the tricks and artifices by which certain popular writers allow themselves to be boomed into public favor .

		Even if such artifices were not equally repugnant to myself , I should have felt precluded from using them on
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's behalf .

		It is therefore significant that the sale of his best work maintains itself at a high level , it having been found necessary to reprint the ' Poems ' almost every year since the collected edition of
1896	DATE	; that there is a steadily increasing demand from compilers of anthologies for permission to include specimens of his work ; and that com - posers also show an increasing appreciation of the essential singing qualities of his lyrics which kins him closer to
Heine	PERSON	than any other English poet of the nineteenth century .

		The public is really not so fickle or so unintelligent as is sometimes feared .

		Good work finds its level , and the lovers of the best literature are not so few as is imagined . ''

		This letter is a credit to the publisher who writes it , as well as to the poet whose name it exalts .

		• • • The prevalence of transmitted stupiditt is more noticeable than that of inherited genius .

		Great men 's sons are conceded to bear little resem - blance to their fathers , as a rule .

		It takes several generations for nature to recover from the exhaus - tion consequent on the endowment of a genius .

		Alexander ,
Caesar	PERSON	, and
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	, left no sons that could wield their sceptres .

		And yet
Dickens	PERSON	did have one son , his youngest , the late
Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens	PERSON	, who could on occasion show a spark of his illustrious father 's wit .

		Emigrating -LRB- not under compulsion -RRB- to
Australia	LOCATION	, he represented for six years a con - stituency in the parliament of
New South Wales	LOCATION	-- although his legislative experience appears to have been unhappy , since he was heard to say , after being defeated by a labor candidate , that he was '' out of health , out of temper , and out of pocket , '' because of having accepted an election to parliament .

		Once -- and this vras when he displayed a gleam of his father 's brightness -- he was addressing the
House	ORGANIZATION	, when an opposing member ,
Willis	PERSON	by name , annoyed him repeatedly with snappish interruptions .

		Finally endurance could no further go , and Mr.
Dickens	PERSON	turned to the chair and said : '' Mr.
Speaker	PERSON	, my father coined a famous phrase -- '
Barkis	PERSON	is willing . '

		Under present circumstances I am strongly tempted to reverse it and say , '
Willis	PERSON	is barking . ' ''

		Laughter from the
House	ORGANIZATION	and quiet from
Willis	PERSON	then ensued .

		• • • A kevivad of Greek tragedy in
France	LOCATION	is reported , and it appears to enjoy a popular success that is both astonishing and gratifying .

		Houses are filled , and the people give unmistakable evidence of a capacity to appreciate something higher than continuous vaudeville .

		The movement began about twelve years ago , when the little city of Orange , in the
Midi	LOCATION	, recollected that it had the remains of a Roman amphitheatre , built in the days when
Gaul	PERSON	was in that tripartite condition of which every schoolboy has learned with tears and groans .

		With the aid of M. Mounet-Sully and support from the Theatre Fran ^ ais , Sophocles 's '' Qidipus the King '' was impressively rendered , in free translation .

		Other towns with ruins of Roman theatres , and even towns without them , took the hint , and out-of-door performances of Greek tragedy attained a certain vogue ; eminent composers furnished the necessary choral music , and the best orchestras of
France	LOCATION	conti'ibuted of their skill as executants .

		The new fashion spread northward from rural southern
France	LOCATION	until the very suburbs of
Paris	LOCATION	caught the fever , and now it is reported that in the heart of the city itself , on the stages of the Com ^ die Franjaise and the Theatre Frangais , ^ - Eschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides are played to appreciative audiences .

		In the
spring	DATE	and
summer	DATE	of this year '' Electra '' has had thirty performances -- not a bad run for a Sophoclean play in the twentieth century .

		Note - worthy , too , is the popular refusal to be satisfied with any modern imitations of Greek tragedy : the real thing is demanded , and tliat with an urgency that makes it pay to give it .

		It looks as if it were turning out , after all , to be impossible to fool all the people all the time with inferior drama .

		• • • The decline of the poetic dr.ima in En - gland receives a new explanation , and to our mind not a very convincing one , from Mr.
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, who in his recent life of Shakespeare cuts off the heads of a good many flourishing weeds of criticism , while planting not a few new ones himself . ''

		With the disappearance of the boy-players , '' says Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	, '' the poetic drama died in
England	LOCATION	; and it has had no second life . ''

		Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	's '' most exquisite reason '' for this amazing theory is that '' Poetry , like religion , is outraged when it is made a platform for the exhibition of their own talent or passion by those who are its ministers . ''

		In other words , the better a piece of literature is interpreted the worse it is , and the nearer to its death .

		We do not believe that the advent of women players had anything to do with the fall of the poetic drama .

		The elaboration of scenery may be partly to blame .

		But the simplest explanations are the lack of poetic genius in the dramatists , and a gradual coarsening of taste in the public .

		Even yet , audiences are re - sponsive to what they think is poetry or fine vrriting .


Claude Melnotte	PERSON	's picture of his imaginary palace can always be relied upon for a round of applause .

		And as a rule ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's set speeches are listened to with pleased attention .

		If actresses killed the poetic drama in
England	LOCATION	, why did they not prevent its rise in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	?

		One does not place the drama of Corneille and
Racine	LOCATION	, or that of Hugo and Musset , or thatof
Goethe	PERSON	and
Schiller	PERSON	, on an equality with the Elizabethan theatre , but they are each and all of them great enough , and poetic enough , to make Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	's theory untenable .

		THE DIAL 113 Ax OCTOGEXAEIAX PHILASTHBOPIBT AXD EDITOE whom thousands delighted to honor , in remembrance at least , on the recent occasion of his eighty-fifth birthday , is the venerable and still energetic
George T. AngeU	PERSON	, animal-lover and founder of '' the societj - with the long name . ''

		prime mover in countless other good works , and editor of the ever anecdotic and entertaining as well as beneficent '' Our Dumb
Ani	PERSON	- mals . ' ''

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	says he wants half
a million dollars	MONEY	yearly to carry on his work , which demands fifty thousand dollars a year for printing alone .

		He is a wonderfully successful money-raiser , having raised all the funds for the conduct of his vast oper - ations as bead of his Society - .

		and it is to be hoped , with considerable confidence , that he will in some way and without overtaxing his strength secure the half-million he needs .

		It is pleasant to note , in this age of monopolistic greed , that Mr.
AngeU	PERSON	actually takes delight in seeing four other cruelty-preventing societies flourishing side by side with his own -- all in the interests of dumb animals .

		By the way , our designation of this veteran benefactor as a philan - thropist was not the aptest possible : rather is he , first and foremost , a philozoist .

		if we may coin the word .

		Or has some one been before us in its use ?

		• • • BiBLIOKLEPTS AXD BOOK-MARKKRS are a public nuisance : at least , the public-library patron must so regard them .

		Word comes from the
Somerville Public Libran	LOCATION	, - .

		admiraUy and liberally conducted by Mr.
Sam Walter Foss	PERSON	, of rec `` nt serious losses through abuse of open-shelf privileges .

		A citizen has been arrested , tried , and imprisoned , for syste - matic biblioklepsis : but still the pilfering continues .

		And not only lighter literature but serious works also are thus misappropriated .

		Even theological treatises are walked off ■ vvith -- under clerical vest - ments , we may surmise .

		By none is the irritating practice of marking , underscoring , commenting , and interlining more persistently and outrageously in - dulged in than by the readers of theological and philosophical works .

		We chanced some time ago to borrow from a public library Marti nean 's '' Stndy of Religion . ''

		and found that some heavy fist , armed with a very black lead pencil , had been through the two volumes , from beginning to end , putting almost every page into deep mourning .

		The wonder is that the miscreant had not been caught , black - handed , when he returned the book .

		In ever \ ' library there should be stationed one or more lynx - eyed agents of the -LRB- desiderated -RRB-

		• • ■ A GRATurrttrs bluxder ix histokt was that committed by the orator of the day at the laying of the corner-stone of the
Provincetown	LOCATION	monument to the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Surely President
Roosevelt	PERSON	is aware of the distinction , long insisted upon by historians of
New England	LOCATION	, between Pilgrims and Puritans .

		Why , then , did he make the historical part of his speech fairly bristle with the words Puritan and Puritanism , and never onc `` name the ' Pilgrims ?

		The founders of
Plymouth	LOCATION	had naught of the Puritan 's reli ^ ous bigotry and fanaticism , and Mayflower descendants are quick to resent any such imputation .

		The compact drawn up in Pro- vincetown harbor , in the cabin of the little vessel that had survived the bufferings of the stormy
Atlantic	LOCATION	, was conceived in no spirit of Puritanical strictness : it has been commended for its liberalism .

		It is significant that the speakers who followed the chief orator were scrupulously correct in avoiding the word Puritan and in paying due tribute to the virtues of the Pilgrim fathers and mothers , many I of whose descendants were in the audience .

		Senator \ Lodge , as if to rectify the error of the leading orator -LRB- who had gone so far as to call his hearers • • you .

		sons of the Puritans , '' and to style the town that was extending to him its hospitality .

		~ this shrine of Puritanism '' -RRB- , took pains to say that '' the beginnings of the great Puritan colony were at
Cape Ann	LOCATION	and Salem and
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		The ' ■ scholar in polities '' undeniably has his uses , and one of these was well and gracefully served by the senior senator from Massachoaetts in his scholarly address at
Provincetown	LOCATION	.

		, , , A
Theodore Parker	PERSON	cextexart is already assuming shape in the city of his renown -- three years ahead of time .

		It is little more than half a century since an exchange with
Parker	PERSON	meant pub - lic censure , if not digmiMa '' l from his pulpit , to the daring exchanger .


James Freeman Clarke	PERSON	was the only one who could -LRB- potuit quia poeae owuf ett -RRB- thus indulge in an interchange of professional courtesies with impunity .

		But as the trite saj ` ing puts it , the radicalism of yesterday becomes the conservatism of to-morrow ; and although a cente - nary - edition of

Sept. 1	DATE	, ^ t itto § oohs .

		BtJBTON THE Unappreciated .

		* The '' real ''
Washington	LOCATION	or
Cromwell	PERSON	or
Franklin	PERSON	which it has become the literary fashion to offer with so solemn an air of at last serving up the genuine man as he walked and talked , and as his contemporaries saw him , is of course nothing but the writer 's conception or ideal of the character he has chosen to paint , labelling his picture '' The Real Agamemnon , '' much as the schoolboy writes under the rude drawing on his slate , '' This is a horse . ''

		Mr.
Walter Phelps Dodge	PERSON	's `` Real Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	'' is actually a panegyric rather than a biography , and appears to owe its origin to the writer 's dissatisfaction with Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	's much more detailed and more '' real '' presentation of the same interesting man .

		But the later and smaller work will serve its uses as a handy epitome of the chief events in
Burton	LOCATION	's life , and as a glowing tribute will help to keep fresh the laurels on the dead hero 's brow .

		To original research or critical acumen it can make little claim , nor does the author appear to have had any personal acquaintance with the subject of his sketch .

		As Mr.
Dodge	PERSON	chooses to dwell so insistently on the injuries his hero has received from the world in general and from Mr.
Wright	PERSON	in par - ticular , it may be worth while to examine a few of these charges of crying injustice .

		He says of the offending biogi-aphy that it `` is more of a Criticism than a Biography , and is a note book , practically devoted to a discursive and abortive effort to prove that
Burton	PERSON	did not rank as a translator with
John Payne	PERSON	.

		Wright also ab - surdly states that
Burton	PERSON	borrowed much of the material in his ' Arabian Nights ' from
Payne	PERSON	. ''

		And further : '' The charge made by
Wright	PERSON	in his so-called Life of
Burton	LOCATION	, that the Haji plagiarised from
Payne	PERSON	... is ridiculous . ''

		Why all this heat ?

		The glory of the home - keeping , dictionary-thmnbing translator is one , and the glory of the restlessly wandering student of men and manners , and the marvellously versatile speaker of many tongues , is another .

		Not even Mr.
Dodge	PERSON	would like to think of the
Chevalier Burton	PERSON	as biting his nails to the quick in a futile endeavor to hit on the exact English equivalent of an Arabic term , nor should he begrudge the scholarly
Payne	PERSON	his weU-eamed distinction as a skilful interpreter of alien lan - * The Real Sik

		guages .

		To make light of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's '' deadly parallels , '' whereby the later translators ap - propriations from his predecessor 's version are made glaringly apparent , is no satisfactory explanation of these curious instances of verbal identity -- an identity that must be regarded as something more than '' a necessary resem - blance in Englishing the text . ''

		Phrases and sentences alike in both versions occur too often to be ascribed to chance ; and identical passages of considerable length are not wanting , one of them reaching to the length of forty-four words .

		The assertion , too , that
Burton	PERSON	's translation has '' replaced aU other versions of the ' Nights ' '' is a bold one to make so soon after the publication of anew edition of Lane 's stUl popular selection .

		Again , concerning
Burton	PERSON	's long poem , '' The Kasidah , '' Mr.
Dodge	PERSON	says : '' It seems to have enraged the latest of
Burton	PERSON	's biographers ,
Wright	PERSON	, who devotes more than a couple of pages in his second volume -LRB- pp. 20-22 -RRB- to abusing it . ''

		To an unprejudiced reader there is neither rage nor abuse apparent in the pages referred to ; and near the close , after citing two couplets that '' flash with auroral splendour , '' Mr.
Wright	PERSON	so far subdues his alleged wrath as to remark that '' neglecting the four reaUy brilliant lines , the principal attraction of The JTasulali .

		is its redo - lence of the saffron , iuimeasurable desert .

		We snuff at every turn its invigorating air ; and the tinkle of the camel 's bell is its sole and per - petual music . ''

		That
Burton	PERSON	's conterapoi-aries often failed to recognize his genius , and that his coimtry refused him the honors and the offices that were heaped upon lesser men , is not to be disputed .

		An excess of the fortiter in re and too little of the suaviter in modo , in
Burton	LOCATION	's character and bearing , are accountable for this injustice .

		It is now so freely admitted that he was a bigger man than the jealously cautious
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	was willing to allow , that there is no occasion to make extravagant claims in his behalf .

		To declare him '' the pioneer of African explora - tion , '' for example , does violence to history .

		Livingstone -LRB- to name no others -RRB- had already discovered
Lake Ngami	LOCATION	and crossed
South Africa	LOCATION	from
Zambesi	LOCATION	to
Loando	LOCATION	some years before
Burton	PERSON	started to explore the Dark Con - tinent in quest of the sources of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		Coming to the question of his hero 's purity of morals , the eulogist gravely declares that ''
Burton	PERSON	throughout his life was a moral man .

		Whether his morality was mental or tempera - mental matters little .

		The fact remains . ''

		Without puzzling over the exact distinction
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 between mental and temperamental morality , it is pleasant to believe that the author of '' The Scented Garden '' was chaste in thought and word and deed : and perhaps we are as free to hold this belief as to maintain with Mr.
Wright	PERSON	that in his early East Indian days , '' like the rest
Burton	PERSON	had his Bubu . ''

		But what grounds for confidence in so private a matter does either writer possess ?

		Enough about the book ; now let us have a taste of its style as illustrated by a few typical passages .

		Of
Burton	PERSON	at
Damascus	LOCATION	we read : `` No British Consul in a great Oriental town ever had half the power or influence wielded by
Richard Burton	PERSON	, and had the Foreign 0 #
Bce	ORGANIZATION	appreciated the benefit to British prestige gained by his exertions the whole his - tory of British policy in the near
East	LOCATION	could have been different ;
England	LOCATION	might have had an ambassador at
Constantinople	LOCATION	who would have had the ear not only of the Commander of the Faithful , but that of the
Shaykh	PERSON	- ul-Islam as well .

		With one class in
Damascus Burton	LOCATION	was at once on bad terms .

		He would have nothing to do with the Jewish money-lenders who flourished there under British protection , and declined to allow his
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	to be used as a debt-collectiug agency .

		The Hebrew usurers resented this , as they had foimd earlier consuls more pliable , and at once began to plot for his recall .

		Indeed , this was the foimdation of that unholy alliance between the Shy locks of
Damascus	LOCATION	and the pitiful British missionary cabal at
Beyrout	LOCATION	, the alliance that ultimately resulted in the recall of the most bril - liant and successful consul
Great Britian	LOCATION	had ever had in the Orient . ''

		Soon after this came the appointment to the consulship at
Trieste	LOCATION	, in succession to
Charles Lever	PERSON	, who had just died at his post , as did
Burton	PERSON	eighteen years later . ''

		To offer a man with the fame of
Burton	PERSON	a small dull
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	like
Trieste	LOCATION	after his great ser ^ - ices was no less than an insult ; but
Burton	PERSON	showed his pluck by accepting it without complaint , hoping that it might prove a stepping-stone to the
Eastern Embassy	ORGANIZATION	he longed for but never obtained .

		Had
Burton	PERSON	been an American he would have had the English mission , or later would have been Governor-General of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines .

		Being an Englishman , he took what he could get and was as thankful as his sardonic humour woiild allow .

		The greatest Orientalist of his age became Consul at
Trieste	LOCATION	, where
Lingua Franca	PERSON	and bastard German were the tongues understanded of the people ! ''

		At least one thing , then , this imdervalued genius hatl reason t '' be thankful for -- only he did n't know it .

		Xot being an American , and not living into the present century , he was sparetl the dreary task of trying to impose an Anglo-Saxon government upon a Polynesian people .

		The unconscious humor of Mr.
Dodge	PERSON	's clos - ing page tempts to further -LRB- and final -RRB- quotation . ''

		No one who reads all the so-called ' Lives ' -LSB- of
Burton	PERSON	-RSB- can help a feeling of distressed wonder at these squabbles in print over unimportant pomts of detail .

		-
Burton	PERSON	-- who thought Imperially -- would have brushed them aside with a reference to the gossip of the servants ' liall .

		It takes a great man to write the life of a great man , and there are few such ' Lives ' !

		In spite of the differing accounts of his career , now over-flattering , now venomously friendly , he will be judged fairly by posterity -- tliis most fascinating ancient among the modems . ''

		Like his hero , Mr.
Dodge	PERSON	indidges in occa - sional odd or archaic terms , as for instance , -- coolth , travestation , knowledged , and mote -LRB- past tense of might -RRB- .

		He also sanctions by his use the time-honored misquotation , `` fresh fields and pastures new , '' and he or his printer gives us the strange word '' encyclopaedic . ''

		The only portrait offered of the '' real '' Sir
Richard	PERSON	is a curious and not easily recognizable cartoon from '' Vanity Fair . ''

		However , it may repre - sent the genuine
Burton	PERSON	whom we have never before encountered .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Tragkdy of the Puritan Revolu - Tiox ix Dialogue .

		* The volume entitled '' From King to King , '' by Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, is made up of a series of dialogues assigned to various significant moments from
1632	DATE	to
1662	DATE	, from the impris - onment of '' lion '' Eliot to the execution of
Sir Henry Vane	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the purpose in our author 's mind , the preface throws this light : '' The pages that follow contain an attempt to state , in a concrete form , certain universal aspects of a par - ticular period of history .

		The tragedy lies in the conflict of reforming energy with actnal men and insti - tutions ; and it has been the object of the author to delineate vividly the characters of leading actors in the struggle , their ideals , and the distortion of these as reflected in the current of events ... The dramatic form was deliberately chosen because that of aa essay appeared insufficient . ''

		In other words , the dramatic dialogue was to be tried as a form of essay ; and we need hardly say that such an experiment in the hands of Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	coiUd not fail to be worth a fairly careful examination .

		Perhaps , then , one 's first clear conclusion is that our author has chosen a most suitable his - torical epoch for his purpose .

		The future of responsible government and of the individual conscience was upon the razor-edge of Fate ; complicated and important issues were met by divergent and interesting personalities ; and within such a period it is not hard to select dramatic moments or impressive characters .

		If we turn to the second dialogue , we find Laud • Fhom King to King .

		By
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	.


Kew York	LOCATION	:
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, and
Chillingworth	PERSON	as the principal interlocutors , and the date as
June 30 , 1637	DATE	.

		First we have an attendant 's vivid account of the moving scenes at the piUorying of
Bastwick	LOCATION	,
Burton	PERSON	, and Prynne ; and we recall that Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, in his readable presentation of '' England under the Stuarts , '' is inclined to take this ill-timed punishment as the beginning of the revolution .

		Then follows an interchange of thoughts between Laud , the thoroughgoing formalist and prelate , and
Chillingworth	PERSON	, the academic moderate , who looks upon the world from a student 's window .

		In five pages both men are put before us in their essential features ; but naturally Laud is the more prominent .

		Here is a type -- the man who believed with all his vital powers that the life of religion depended upon its forms , and saw in the church , as Professor
Gardiner	PERSON	suggests , not a temple of the spirit but the palace of a king . ''

		Men are governed by custom rather than convic - tion ... He who is accustomed to bow his knees will the sooner learn to humble his heart .

		... As there is one truth , so should there be one observance ... Maintaining the authority of the church , we maintain the bond of all society .

		... If we fail -LRB- which God for - bid ! -RRB-

		the state fails with us .

		The Monarchy stands or falls with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	with the Monarchy . ''

		And so , with Strafford , he drove along the fate - ful way .

		A review of the remaining dialogues woidd show no less felicity of choice .

		For instance , the captions of the ninth and tenth chapters are : '' The King and his Groom of the Cham - ber ,
Thomas Herbert	PERSON	, at
Newport	LOCATION	, '' and ``
John Lilburne	PERSON	before the Council . ''

		The tenth , ''
Strafford	PERSON	and his former tutor , Gi'eenwood , in the Tower , '' recalls
Browning	PERSON	's drama , perhaps more happy in subject than successful m execution .

		But Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	has been too wise to limit himself to major personages ; and in '' The Camp of the Parliamentary Troops at Naseby '' he has given us some suggestive minor characters .

		Here , along with other types , we have the formal Presbyterian minister quoting Scripture interminably for a purpose , in sharp contrast with the sturdy soldier who has fought and felt too much to speak by the book . ''

		We wiU set up our congi-egatipn in the fields , and our liturgy shall be the promptings of the heart '' has the ring of such hearts as we like to think of in the '' New Model '' army .

		In the second part of the same dialogue we have an opportunity to ob.serve how our author can weave description into his general plan .

		In many ways ,
Falkland	ORGANIZATION	is the most interesting character in the whole period , -- `` one whose purpose by two much thought was vexed but not perverted , '' who knew that the tumultuous tide of Fate may drive the little bark of man over strange seas to strange shores or may whelm it in the deep .

		It is with all conscientiousness that '' the impeacher of
Finch	PERSON	, the shaker of
Strafford	LOCATION	, the putter to shame of bishops '' be - comes the faithfid minister of a faithless king .

		And it is thus we leave him at the end of the sixth dialogue .

		Then in the above mentioned section we have the following : '' First Officer .

		-- ' I know him ; he was a wise man . ' ''

		Second Officer .

		-- ' On the wrong side . ' ''

		First Officer .

		-- ' If so , he had at least tlie grace to be imhappy there .

		They tell me that as the war pro- ceeded he lost his wonted cheerfulness , neglected his dress , grew careless of food or drink , spoke not at all , or only with a sliarp intemperance ; and , starting at whiles from melancholy reverie , would frecjuently in - geminate the burden '' Peace !

		Peace ! ''

		In battle , as he was careless of danger , so he cared not to kill , but rather to succor the wounded , till at last , as one who was weary of life , he deliberately laid it aside in tlie thickest of the fire at
Newbury	ORGANIZATION	. ' ''

		With the help of this passage we see clearly the man whom even
Clarendon	PERSON	had the gi'ace to love ; and it is perhaps no accident that our author borrows a line from that flagrant par - tisan 's i-emarkable history .

		Thus far our quotations have happened only upon prose ; but in nine of the thirteen dialogues blank verse is freely employed , in most cases with success .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	must have studied this phase of seventeenth-century literature very profitably ; for he has succeeded in putting ap - propriate verse on the lips of his different char - acters .

		Indeed , there is as much difference in the metrical speeches assigned to MUton and
Cromwell	PERSON	as in their prose utterances .

		To show how happUy our author has caught the Miltonic breath , we may be allowed to make a brief quotation .

		`` To sucli -LSB- the heavenly choir -RSB- attune , though weak , my mortal voice That , while this island nation , bom anew , A golden eagle , beats her dauntless wings , Undazzled , full against the blaze of noon , I , with not too presmnptuous aim , may sing Her praises right , nor , honoring her , forget To celebrate , as due .

		Thee , sole Supreme , Thee first .

		Thee last , and Thee eternally . ''

		An examination of the whole passage would show more instances of the hypermetric syllable than we should find in a simQar number of
Milton	LOCATION	's lines ; but the imitation is still a rather remark - able performance .

		Space forbids , or we coiUd adduce not a few other passages of real merit and attractiveness .

		We knew that Mr.
Dickin	PERSON	- son was a master of prose ; apparently he might have written admirable verse .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 However , all criticism of the work must re - turn to the question of the success of the dra - matic dialogue as an essay form .

		Some kindl -RCB- - critics have already spoken of the production as `` closet drama ' '' ; but surely this loses the point of view .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	is primarily an essayist ; and the present volume is simply a variant in form .

		On the whole , one finds himself inclined to decide that the experiment is successful ; for the dialogue has enabled our author to realize his hope of effectively setting forth the clash of the individual with a movement .

		At times we wonder whether Mi * .


Dickinson	PERSON	has secured the unity which he aimed at ; but he himself saw that he was writing for readers having a general ac - quaintance with the period , and for such readers liere would be no urgent need of the intimate bond of plot demanded by the drama .

		That he could not have accomplished so much by the same number of pages in any other essay form , we are inclined to believe ; so that from the critic 's point of view the dramatic dialogue is justified .

		And yet there is a little reserve about one 's commendation of the book as a whole .

		In the first place , it can appeal only to a much nar - rower circle than most of Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's other productions , and he is too able a writer to be excused for atldressing hiuLself to an audience in any way circumscribed .

		In the second place , there are occasional suggestions of the cold lit - erary exercise . ''

		We talk like rhetoricians , '' cries
Cromwell	PERSON	, in bitterness , to Vane ; and there is a dangerous tang of truth in his words .

		Perhaps it is the influence of Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's foreseen audience , perhaps it is an academic preoccupation with his art ; but occasionally his production borders on the faultily faiUtless .

		Let us glance at one excerpt : ''
Milton	PERSON	.

		-- ' O sir , the title were an honor indeed .

		The poet is he who understands the world in its essence and origin ,
Love	LOCATION	.

		The beauty he perceives and cele - brates is the final expression of truth ; and that which action and philosophy forever seek , he in a moment arrests and fixes in enduring lineaments .

		His life passes out of himself into the larger life of the whole , whereby he is turned insensibly to virtue , following from the necessity of his nature the maxims the mor - alist enjoins .

		His aim and achievement is immortality , so that even while yet in the bonds of the flesh , he is rapt at whiles into the heaven of heavens , catching sound of those eternal harmonies , whose echoes alone inform his vital and inevitable numbers . ' ''

		It is absolutely flawless ; but it is not in the personal and living style of `` A Modem Sym - posium '' or the '' Letters from a Chinese Official . ''

		The preface of this work tells us that the first edition appeared in

Air	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dickinson 's subse - quent success was not at all strange , if he could write so well sixteen years ago .

		However , a personal note from the publishers states that the dialogues have been '' largely edited and in some places re - written . ''

		In any event , it is safe to say that to most Ailierican readers , as to the present WTiter , '' From King to King '' is entirely new ; and that in this country it will be thought of as belonging to the author 's later works .

		The volume will be a source of genuine pleasure to Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's old admirers , as well as to a few new readers who are interested in the Puritan revolution ; it will not materially \* ` iden his circle , nor does it represent his highest possibilities as a factor in the molding of con - temporary thought .

		*
William Pitt	PERSON	, the elder , was
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	from
1757	DATE	to
1761	DATE	-- four years memorable in the history of the English I people .

		They laid the foundations for the Brit - ish empire in
India	LOCATION	, decided the long contest for supremacy between the British and French nations in
America	LOCATION	, and drove the French ; from the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		They embrace the victories of
Louisburg	LOCATION	,
Ft. Duquesne	LOCATION	, and
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		The participation of the American colonial militia in these campaigns taught them the higher arts of war and inspired in them the • confidence that enabled them , nearly a score of years later , to face the British regulars on the slope of Breed 's Hill .

		The large drafts for men and supplies during these wars persuaded the colonies that they had contributed more than their just share for the defense of the realm , and this feeling was largely responsible for the resistance to the .

		stamp-tax at a later time .

		In the conduct of the American campaigns , the colonial and military governors acted as representatives of the crown , and were in con - stant correspondence with
Pitt	PERSON	as
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The letters comprising their correspon - 1 dence bear on many parts of American history ; and for this reason the
National Society of Colonial Dames of America	ORGANIZATION	has rendered a use - ful service in making possible the publication of copies of the letters , edited by Miss Gertrude • COKHESPOSDESCE OF WlLUAM PiTT WITH THE COLONnAL QovEBsoBS IN

Sept. 1	DATE	,
Selwyn Kimball	PERSON	, already favorably known as editor of the correspondence of the Colonial Governors of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		The originals of the letters written to
Pitt	PERSON	are pi-eserved in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, and those written by him are preserved in a clerk 's hand , in a duplicate dispatch book .

		Of the 507 let - ters covering the period , 114 were rejected by the editor as unimportant , leaving 493 printed in the present volume .

		Of this large number of letters , only 68 have heretofore appeared in print , -- a statement which at once shows the value of these volumes to the student .


Pitt	PERSON	wrote 170 of the letters , and the remaining ones were written to him .

		The letters are preceded by an excellent historical sketch by the editor , touching on the chief events with which the cor - respondence is concerned .

		In copying the letters the spelling and punctuation have been followed , giving them an added air of authenticity .

		Upon nearly every page of these volumes the reader gets a glimpse of the difficidties of con - ducting military campaigns in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The constant bickering between the Governor and the Assemblies in the several colonies over the voting of supplies to the home government , the reluctance of the Quakers to assist in the war , and similar sources of friction , are every - where revealed .

		The Governors complain of the '' refractoriness '' of the Assemblies , and of the Friends who write to the Indians begging them to remain neutral , while the British wish to use them against the French .

		Wealthy colonists who enlisted their indented servants were keen in demands for their bounty and pay .

		Military expeditions were obliged to establish depots of supplies forty miles apart along their line of march , because the country was unin - habited .

		The Indians were '' like sheep , -- where one leaps aU the rest follow . ''

		Governor
Dinwiddie	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	apologizes for sending Indians on a scalping foray against the French , declaring it '' a barbarous method of conducting war , introduced by the French , which we are obliged to follow in our own defense . ''

		Evidence of the discrimination constantly practised between the British regulars and the colonial militia are not difficult to find .

		A commandant advises that
Fort Cumberland	LOCATION	, on the
Potomac	LOCATION	, be garrisoned by militia rather than by regulars , because the fort could not withstand an attack , and its capture when guarded by provincials would be '' less an affair of Eclat '' than if garrisoned by the
King	ORGANIZATION	's troops .

		Instances are found of the difficulty the Governors experienced in trying to deter settlers from advancing beyond the safety-line on the frontiers ; and there are interesting glimpses of the Acadians , and of their dispersal .

		Franklin 's name appears as a prominent citizen of
Philatlelphia	LOCATION	, and
General Israel Putnam	ORGANIZATION	plays an important part ; but one looks in vain for the name of
Washington	LOCATION	, although he was actively connected with the taking of
Fort DuQuesne	LOCATION	.

		Teachers and students of early American history owe to the patriotic society of women , and to
Miss Kimball	PERSON	, their thanks for making available these interesting records , and for pointing a way which other patriotic organiza - tions may profitably follow .

		Choick Facts Choicely Embellished . '' '

		It seems little short of rudeness , in the face of such sumptuous volumes as these on
Canada	LOCATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, the
Thames	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	, to recall the old lady who entitled her commonplace book '' Choice Facts . ''

		But after reatling the texts one can not help recognizing the appropriateness of her title as a criticism .

		Why can not people who write about places remember that in them - selves places are not very interesting to read about , and that art must supply what the in - trinsic nature of the subject lacks ?

		A place used as a background has the perspective of human interests , but a place brought into its own foreground and made the whole subject of the picture has the flat appearance of a child 's dra ^ ving , with one feature following another in purely surface succession unless through some principle of relation the artist focuses and embosses .

		It is the lack of such a principle that leaves these four handsome books mere colloca - tions of facts , more or less '' choice '' according to the selective power of the writers .

		One feels the absence of artistic unity in the text all the more because of the beauty of the book-making .

		Paper , print , binding , and illustrations are as perfect as may be .

		Indeed the pictures , which are colored reproductions of paintings , are so numerous and beautifid that to certain minds they will constitute the chief merit of the books , •

		THE DIAL 119 and cause the text to be looked upon as mere padding .

		In compiling his work on
Canada	LOCATION	Mr.
Wilfred Campbell	PERSON	must have had occasion to echo ilr .

		Crothers 's complaint that ' • the trouble with facts is there are so many of them . ''

		He deserves especial praise for selecting well from such a mass of material .

		The value of his book to the ordinary reader is that it brings together various kinds of information which without it would have to be gathered from many sources .

		Thfere is a little history , a little biography , a few statements of political and economic prob - lems , woven together with considerable descrip - tion and numerous quotations of poetiy .

		Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's original work is mostly in the descriptions , many of which are very good .

		It is scarcely fair to quote detached sentences , but the spirit of the descriptive passages is well illustrated by these extracts from some pages on the forests : '' The beech-wood is purely Greek in all of its spirit and characteristics .

		There is something about the beech-tree itself , in all its form and character , which suggests statuary -- the pure smoothness and perfection of trunk and limb ; the firmness of the leaf , with its copper-brown in autumn , which suggests beauty in form , and delicacy of color and finish in outline .

		It suggests culture , outward beauty , simplicity , and finality .

		... How different it is from the beech-wood in the shade of the mighty elm , the maple and the bass-wood !

		Here the sense felt is purely Gothic .

		The sense of beauty , form , and finality is lost in reverence , sublimity , vastnesB , and infinity ... Far different from the others is the identity of the pine-forest .

		As the beech - wood is Greek in its suggestion , and the maple and elm - wood Gothic , so the pine-wood is in its whole character distinctly Celtic .

		Everything here suggests withdrawal and seclusion , that almost childish pride in self which is so true of the Celt .

		There is that shadowed gloom which seems to hold an imagination peculiarly its own .

		.

		\ nd the sunlight which reaches these deeps seems to stab with a passion that only the true Celt can feeL '' There is some clear exposition of government problems -- that of amalgamating the French Canadian , • ' whose ideals , race-traditions , and loyalty to all that is French must be left alone , '' and that of importing cheap labor to
British Columbia	LOCATION	, where the
United States	LOCATION	labor boss continues to step in .

		The tone of enthusiastic loyaltj - which pervades the book will commend it to more than a Canadian audience .

		But its first claim to popularity rests on ilr .

		Martin 's beautiful '' pictures , '' some eighty in all .

		Mr.
BeUoc	PERSON	attempts a task almost equally difficult in the history of the Thames .

		His plan is to give a scientific account of the effect which the conformation of the banks and the location of fords has had upon the growth of towns and the movements of armies , then to give an account of a few important places --
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
Windsor	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	Bridge , and the Tower , -- and then to trace the economic development of the valley which was brought about by the founding of the great monasteries .

		He has interesting things to say on these subjects , but in spite of evident efforts to the contrary he becomes in - volved in the tangle of the Thames 's history with that of
England	LOCATION	, and ends in a tedious recital of the destruction of the monasteries , which has little to do with his subject .

		As a result his writing is likely to be looked upon only as a pretext for the pictures .

		These in themselves are an entertainment , though one tires somewhat of the over-refined and some - times affected coloring .

		Mr.
Tuker	PERSON	's book on
Cambridge	LOCATION	is by far the most seriously important of the group , and will at once be recognized by students as a valuable work .

		But from the standpoint of the reader who likes to exereise his • ' pleased attention '' it is a disappointment , because the title rouses anticipa - tions of enjoyment which are not fulfilled .

		Is it only the siunmer mania for being entertained that makes one long to see the genius loci of so tmiqne and significant a place evoked as a real presence ?

		It would take a wizard touch , cer - tainly , to bring forth so complex a spirit , but the truly trusting mind thinks that the thing might have been done .

		Instead , we have two hundred pages -- more than half the book -- of facts , facts , facts , about the founding of colleges and the conferring of d ^ rees , with only a breath of suspicion now and then that a genius of any sort lurks behind them .

		Yet that ilr .

		Tuker feels the presence of a '' spirit of the institution '' is occasionally made evident by such a paragraph as this : ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	has always suggested a certain detach - ment ; neither zeal -- perfervid or sour -- nor the pressure of tradition upon living thought has had its proper home there .

		It has not represented monastie seclusion nor hieratic exclusion , and it did so at this moment of its history -LSB-
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's time -RSB- less than ever .

		The dawn of the coming renascence shone upon the walls at which we have keen looking .

		The modem world has been bom of the birth-pangs which have since convulsed
Europe	LOCATION	, and the walls which were then big with the future are now big with the past .

		But it is the greatness of
Cambridge	LOCATION	that amidst the midtiple snggestiveness of its ancient halls of learning , tyranny of the past has no place .

		About it the dawn of the renascence still lingers ; and the early morning light which presided at its birth still defies the shadows and seems to temper the noon-day heat , as light and shade alternate in its history . ''

		What delightful reading would have resulted \ 120 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, if Mr.
Tuker	PERSON	had chosen to do for
Cambridge	LOCATION	what Mr.
Shaff	PERSON	has just done for the Spirit of Old West Point !

		Still , one can not quarrel with an author 's purpose , and if Mr.
Tuker	PERSON	chose to write a reference book instead of evok - ing a spirit , perhaps there is nothing to say except that he has performed his task well .

		Only , in giving up the contention , the critic may perhaps ask why the chapters on the '' regulai ' '' colleges could not have been made as interesting as the closing chapter on Newn - ham and
Girton	PERSON	, and why some of the men could not have been presented as clearly and memorably as is
Miss Clough	LOCATION	.

		The book on
Paris	LOCATION	by Mr.
Menpes	PERSON	-- or perhaps we should say by Miss Menpes , since the father attributes the text to her -- is much smaller and less elaborate than the others , but much nearer the ideal in interest .

		The pictures , too , are even more successful than in the other books , because of greater depth of color and originality of treatment .

		There is no attempt at history , but only the purpose to present the city of to-day .

		The method is fragmentary , the style discursive .

		Chapters on the fas - cination of the city , the joy of life , children 's pleasures , art and artists , are interspersed with descriptions of boulevards , cafes , and suburbs with no attempt at correlation .

		Yet there is the vividness of actual impression , the realizar tion of activity , color , gaiety .

		One can see the
Rue St. Honore	ORGANIZATION	on a
summer	DATE
morning	TIME	, where perfectly di-essed women , followed by pet ter - riers in '' costumes '' of the same color as their mistresses ' , enter shops to inspect hats of a '' daintiness , crispness , and innocent freshness peculiar to the boulevards '' ; where the men walk in groups chatting and laughing , not morose and intent as in other cities ; where the horses of rich or titled ladies stand for hours waiting before a great dress-making house , and only the actress ' carriage is i-eceived and dis - missed promptly ; where perhaps a pi-ocession of the blanchisenses goes by , '' each laundry sending its chariot , with its queen and her court '' ; or possibly '' a little cortege , sad-colored in the midst of so much gaiety , passes , '' and every hat is taken off , '' as if a magic impidse had passed over
Paris	LOCATION	, leaving every head bare . ''

		The scene is infuiitely varied , but always fas - cinating , and always full of beauty , for to the Parisian '' beauty is not a luxury , but a neces - sity . ''

		It is a great accomplishment to have caught as much of it aU within the pages of one book as the Menpes have done .

		Yet there is no denying the truth of the statement with which they begin the book , that `` the picture has still to be painted , the poem has still to be written , that will present
Paris	LOCATION	, as a whole , in her versatile attractiveness . ''

		Problems of Amekican Democracy .

		* In the view of Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	, as set forth in his recent work on ''
American Legislatures	ORGANIZATION	and Legislative Methods , '' the present era bids fair to rival in historical importance even the years during which the Constitution was form - idated and set in motion , as the relations now calling for adjustment are deeper of reach than the matters of institvitional form settled by the Fathers . ''

		For the present age deals with the coordination of our established political system , democratic in form , with the powerful economic and social forces which the recent past has brought forth and which are oligarchic in their tendency .

		We are livuig m an age in which new social categories are being established .

		It is no longer the form , but the substance , of political and social life that is being affected , through the creation of new groupmgs of power , and through a new correla - tion of influences acting directly upon social and economic life . ''

		Accordingly , Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	goes more deeply into the actual workings of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the
State Legislatures	ORGANIZATION	than is usual in works on political science .

		An introductory chapter by
Piofessor Bernard C. Steiner	PERSON	deals with the constitutional law affecting
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; but in the remainder of the volume constitu - tional forms are referred to only as the basis upon which rest the actual processes of legisla - tion .

		Here a large collection of facts , gathered from a great variety of sources , are arranged and interpreted with a philosophical breadth of view that brings out their underlying significance .

		In discussing the influence of the President upon legislation .

		Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	passes over as a superficial half-truth the view that it depends upon the personal element , and says : '' The liistory of institutions shows that there is a deeper current than mere personal influence or legal arrangement which determines the rise and fall of the power of the various organs of government .

		Of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	he says : '' Any measure which in the remotest manner trenches upon the interests of concentrated wealth , which in the least impedes the activities of great corporations , has a hard road to travel in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		No matter how - insistent may be the popular demand , no matter what expert cMicensus may t-all for such legislation , it will be ignored or endlessly delayed by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and if allowed to pass , will ordinarily be equipped with a few unobtrusive amendments , which , however , are often efficacious to defeat its main purpose .

		Should this ten - dency prevail , should the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	allow itself to become chiefly a vetoing agency , the result wUl be equal to a national calamity .

		It is a revolutionary act to oppose healthy growth , to shut off active currents of develop - ment ; and the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, which by its high position is called upon to mediate between classes and between interests , is in need of a broader philosophy , of more liberal temper , than many of its recent actions indicate .

		Through constantly favoring certain interests , it would sharpen existing antagonisms , and might ultimately threaten the bursting of constitutional restraints and tl ^ attempted creation of new and more popular authori - ties .

		Moreover , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	onght , from its own point of view , to consider that no political body can retain permanent influence and power through a purely nega - tive policy . ''

		Rather more than half the book is devoted to the
State Legislatures	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a depressing chapter on '' The Perversion of Legislative Action '' ' which goes to the root of things in explaining the political actiWtj ' of special inter - ests : but the author 's conclusions are , after all .

		A little more wakefulness , a little more attention to the detailed workings of gov - ernment , a more careful scrutinizing of the personalities to be endowed v ^ - ith public power , '' ' he says , '' may yield returns and restore to tisefulness and public confidence the institutions now so generally decried . ''

		Something has already been accomplished toward improving the legislative product by the appointment of commissions on tmifomi statute laws , and in a few States of committees of revision , or , better , of legislative counsel and draftsmen , or legisla - tive reference librarians who are more than librarians .

		These are imaginary confessions , it is true , but are penned so e ^ ^ dently with a purpose as to leave no doubt that the author intended them to picttire typical conditions in the actual world of to-day .

		The narrative follows the fortunes of a successftd business man , from the time he obtained an exclusive privilege to sell papers in his town as a boy , through the period of franchise-grabbing , to the exalted positions of
State Boss	ORGANIZATION	and United States Senator , It is not pleasant reading -- it is too true to life , though possibly somewhat exaggerated or im - naturally concentrated either for artistic effect or for the sake of argument .

		One instinctively wonders why iilr .

		Howe chose fiction as the vehicle for his message on the evils of special privilege and monopoly .

		It is not because fic - tion is his natural element , for he is much more a master of straightforward argument and of the simple statement of facts .

		Perhaps he sought the widest possible audience for this expositicm of his convictions ; or can it be that he was not sure enough of his ground to state as a general condition what he has imagined as possibly an extreme case ?

		At any rate , he is more at home in the final chapter , where he sets forth the ' ■ ' ■ rules of the game , '' t ^ ian in the thick of the story . ''

		It 's not thrift , prudence , or the saving of gas-bills , that makes the millionaire '' ; the rules of the game are stated thus : '' First , let Society woit for yon ; and , second , make a business of politics .

		Upon an understanding of these rules the great fortunes of
America	LOCATION	have almost all been reared . ''

		In a volume entitled '' The Tariff and the Trusts , '' Mr ,
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , presents a formidable array of arguments , quotations , and facts , to prove that the pro- tective tariff is the mother of monopoly .

		The argument is very one-sided , but is so well put together that the stand-patters can not well af - ford to n ^ lect it .

		There are chapters addressed respectively to the manufacturers , laborers , and farmers , sketches of American tariff historj - and of the free-trade movement in
England	LOCATION	, a chap - ter cm the tariff in
Germany	LOCATION	, and one on '' pro- tective tariffs and public virtue '' in which the author charges the tariff with corrupting
Cmi	ORGANIZATION	- gressmen .

		The specific instances of corruption he cites are not exactly to the point ; but what he says about Senators and Representatives voting on tariff bills in which they are person - ally interested may tend to make the reader feel the hopelessness of a scientific tariff .

		One of the strongest chapters in the book is that on '' American and English Shipping , '' in which the decadence of American shipping is attrib - uted to the denial of American registrj - to ships built abroad , and to the increased cost of ships and restriction of commerce due to the protective tariff .

		The moral intended to be drawn from this chapter , of course , is that a subsidy is not 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the proper remedy for this state of affairs .

		A convenient list of the more imjjortant '' trusts '' is given in Chapter II .

		A lecture by Mr.
Charles Fletcher Dole	PERSON	on '' The Spirit of Democracy , '' delivered three years ago before the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	, has grown in the meantime into a book of the same title , wjuch has been pub - lished chapter by chapter in the ''
Springfield	LOCATION	Republican . ''

		Beginning with some well-written though well-worn platitudes about '' the teaching of liistory '' and democratic ideals , the author sets forth his views of what democracy ought to achieve , in a series of chapters on such miscel - laneous practical problems as the suffrage , treat - ment of crime , pauperism , democracy and the executive , the party system , the rule of the cities , war , imperialism , the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , taxation , immigration , labor unions , socialism , anarchy , religion , education , and the family .

		Of course , the treatment of so many subjects in one small volume must necessarily be superficial and unsatisfactory .

		The author shows his open - mindedness and independence by indorsing pop - ular and unpopular reforms alike , and hence every type of reformer may find in this volume some crumbs of comfort .

		These , perhaps , are the rea < lers to whom the book will chiefly make its appeal ; no hard-headed conservative or skep - tic will be convinced by it , for it fails to answer their objections , and they may even be inclined to think the author something of a faddist .

		Yet it will not satisfy reformers of the '' crank '' type , either ; for it recognizes no panacea , is always optimistic in tone , stops short of extremes , and lays the emphasis after all on the spirit un - derlying outward forms .

		Mr.
Dole	PERSON	would abolish political parties if he coidd , but he believes that the thing most necessary to make democracy a successfid experiment is what he calls '' good - will , '' by which he seems to mean an enlightened altruism magical enough to overcome the sel - fishness and social indifference of faidty human nature , and so make good citizens of the ruling majority .

		According to President
Baker	PERSON	, of the Uni - versity of
Colorado	LOCATION	, the essential problems of
America	LOCATION	are not commercial , political , military , or territorial , but are ethical , sociological , and educational .

		Consistently with this point of view , his book on '' American Problems '' is divided into three parts , entitled '' Ideals , '' '' Sociological Problems , '' and '' Education '' ; yet the ideals and problems discussed are in part political .

		Since the volume is made up of addresses and essays , the reader must not look for unity in theme or in treatment .

		Suffice it to say that the author firmly believes that the world is growing better on the whole , and sets forth his belief in an interesting if not sti'ik - ingly original manner .

		This optimistic attitude of President
Baker	PERSON	, Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	, and Mr.
Dole	PERSON	, notwithstanding the difficulties they fully recognize , together with the problems of impe - rialism discussed by the latter , recalls Mr.

		But now the most interesting of the population statistics have been worked over and interpreted by Professor
John R. Commons	PERSON	in his '' Races and Immigrants in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work is scientific as to method and popular in style , and forms a very useful handbook about the American population .

		Professor Commons describes the colonial race elements , the nineteenth century additions to the American population , the negroes and their problems , and questions of race and nationality as related to industry , occupations , labor unions , city life , crime , health , and politics .

		In the opinion of the author , the inferior races are those of the tropics ; these can be assimilated or Amer - icanized only with difficulty .

		The Jews are the most healthy of the American people , and the negroes least so ; the negroes are the most criminal , with foreign-born people coming next ; up to this time the Germans have come to this country in greater numbers than any other nationality ; the Scotch-Irish have been , in proportion to numbers , the most influential elements in our population ; the Irish have proved to be the best fitted to unite diverse nationalities under their political leadership .

		These are some of the points discussed , with enlightening explanation by the author .

		It is his be - lief that it is becoming more difficult to Americanize immigrants , because our population is nearing the point of saturation ; consequently more stringent regulation of immigration is necessary .

		Race problems , we are told , are hostile to true democracy .

		According to the standards set up by Mr.
Commons	PERSON	, we are far from being a true democracy , the greatest obstacle being the presence of the negro race , which at present , it seems , will not be assimilated .

Crete	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		His oflfering guides us clearly to the fol - lowing conclusions : That the work of excavating in
Crete	LOCATION	is in thoroughly competent hands ; that the final results will be tremendously important for our knowledge of early
Mediterranean	LOCATION	history and development ; that in the second milleniom B. c. a powerful and opulent dynasty held sway in this island over a highly civilized community ; that its relations with
Egypt	LOCATION	and the Orient were exceed - ing ^ j - close : and , above all , that the archaeological situation for this period has become desj -RRB- erately com - plicated , and that a few thousand pressing and inter - esting questions must remain unanswered for several years .

		Throughout the book .

		Professor
Burrows	PERSON	has adhered conscientiously to his plan of setting before the classical scholar and general cultured public '' a dear and comprehensive account of where we stand . ''

		But the trouble is , we do not stand any - where in particular .

		Indeed , as is implied in the preface , '' the next month 's spade-work '' is likely to put any book out of date ; and the temporary Itill in the excavations can hardly save the present volmne from being ephemeral even if opportune .

		In the mean time • • The Discoveries in
Crete	LOCATION	'' will be wel - come to a limited circle for its painstaking summary of the present situation , its impartial balancing of probabilities , and its valuable bibliography .

		SomehUtorie ^ J ^ `` rial for fireside travel grows lutunu in iMe rapidly .

		Another Ulustrated book of old
Bav State	ORGANIZATION	.

		, ^ njbl ^ intermingling description with history , and divided into chapters charmingly brief and to the point , is Mr.
Charles Burr Todd	PERSON	's • • In
Olde Massachusetts	LOCATION	. ''

		the fourth issue in the '' Graf - ton Press Historical Series . ' ''

		edited by Dr.
Henry R. Stiles	PERSON	.

		Twenty-one places of interest are visited , and an attempt is made to call up a vision of the scenes as they were '' during the early days of the Commonwealth . ''

		Forefathers ' Rock at
Plymouth	LOCATION	is called '' the stepping-stone of a new empire '' -- not quite accurately , in view of what we are in these days learning about
Provincetown	LOCATION	and the earlier landing made there by the Mayflower Pilgrims , to say nothing of the almost forgotten landing of En - glish voj-agers at Pemaquid .


Maine	LOCATION	, in the
summer of 1607	DATE	.

		The writer speaks of Miles
Standish	PERSON	's dinner-pot as `` rather insecurely mounted on three rudimentary l ^ s '' ; but of course he remembers that I it was a kettle to be hung over the great open fire , not a pot for the oven , and the l ^ s had a good right to be rudimentary .

		The steep and difficult approach that he describes as leading to Monument Motmtain in
Stockbridge	LOCATION	is haj ^ Qy a thing of the past : since the public-spirited woman who owned the mountain gave it as a perpetual jdeasnre-grotmd to the public , a few years ago , a good path has been made to the summit , with only a little steepness at the very end .

		But the author frankly warns us at the outset that his sketches will occasi < mally be found untrue to present conditions , havii ^ been originally published in various periodicals between
1880	DATE	and
1890	DATE	.

		gafj „ ^ '' Standards of Public Morality , '' by butinmtutd President
Hadley	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, is the inpoiuia .

		second number of the `` American Social Progress Series '' published by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is composed of five chapters delivered
last winter	DATE	in
New York	LOCATION	as lectures on the
John S. Kennedy Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, and treating of the formation of public opinion , the ^ lics of trade , the ethics of corporate management , the wordings of our polit - ical machinery , and the political duties of citizens .

		All these subjects are discussed with the writer 's wonted deamess , force , and good sense , and with a first-hand knowledge derived from his early ex - perience as a labor commissioner and as a journal - ist .

		Sometimes , as a scholar should , he points his moral with an allusion at once witty and learned , as in his citations from
Aristotle	LOCATION	's ** Polities '' ; and I his general tone , that of one impartial and open -LCB- to conviction , tends to win assent .

		His recognition of party machines and party basses as practical necessities maib him out as not exactly the typical '' scholar in politics . ''

		and his lack of enthusiasm for arbitration and for profiV `` haring in the com - mercial world shows him to be other than a theorist \ in things practicaL A short extract from the chap - ter on the citizen 's political duties will give the quality of the writer 's thought . '

		• It is not , '' he declares , ' ■ his chance of oflSee alone , but his chance of influencing his assodatea and setting a mark for his opponents , that the politician throws aside when I he deserts his party .

		Therefore , if a man 's record shows that he has been honestly anxious to do public service , I am very slow to criticise him for standing by his organization through a good deal that is rather bad . ''

		Excellent though the book is .

		a little more of the '' scorn of scorn . ''

		the '' hate of hate . ''

		the love of all ideals of even impossible perfection , might have been expected -- and twenty years ago would have been expected -- in a
New England	LOCATION	college president 's treatment of the subjects discussed .

		Clutpten in the hMmyofa famotu mvth .

		To the mass of literature growing out of the resolutions adopted by the people of
Mecklenburg Coimty	ORGANIZATION	,
Xorth Carolina	LOCATION	, in
1775	DATE	.

		is added a volume by Mr.
WiUiam Hoyt	PERSON	entitled `` The Mecklenburg Declar - ation of Independence '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This volume strengthens the conviction that no new light is likely 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, to be thrown on the matter , and that argument only is left .

		The so-called exjwsure of the forged copy of the missing '' Cape Fear Mercury , '' in the period - ical and quarterly press last year , shows the lengths to which those must go who would add to the facts in the case .

		Mr.
Hoyt	PERSON	attempts only to collect and examine the existing material .

		He makes no at - tempt to discredit the story that certain resolutions were adopted by the people of
Mecklenburg County	LOCATION	in
1775	DATE	, but thinks the date should be
May 31	DATE	rather than
May 20	DATE	.

		Then he produces arguments to prove that whatever the people adopted could not have been '' independence '' bectiuse it did not secure them independence -- a polemic situation which much resembles a man of straw .

		This seems to be the only myth the author feels called upon to destroy .

		He absolves
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	from the charge of plagiarism , in his Declaration of Independence of
1776	DATE	.

		The volume may be regarded as a history of the controversy , rather than a history of the Declaration .

		The last page leaves the reader as helpless as tlie first , in ability to separate hearsay from evidence .

		But the book is valuable as a history of a controversy which has raged for more than a century , at one time intensified by sectionalism , which has brought a heroic defense from the de - scendants of the signers , which has induced forgery , and seems as yet no nearer a settlement than when it began .

		The appendix contains valuable documents connected with the dispute , while in the volume may be found facsimiles of the forged newspaper of
1775	DATE	containing the resolutions , of the spm-ious docu - ment lithographed for the anniversary celebration at
Charlotte	LOCATION	in
1892	DATE	, and of various letters by which the '' recollections '' of the event were written out twenty-five years after they occurred .

		A biblio - graphy and an index would have added to the use - fulness of the work .

		Two attractive little volumes by Miss Romantic haunts y ; j ^ ^ p j. / fetter known by her of sona and story .

		° , .

		, \ r x , , % pen-name oi '' Vernon L , ee -RRB- are is - sued in a second edition by the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are '' Genius Loci : Notes on Places , '' and ''
Pope Jacynth	PERSON	, and Other Fantastic Tales . ''

		Though the first book is buUt on a more substantial basis of fact than the second , the imaginative element predom - inates in each , and they may well be grouped together .

		In the introduction to her notes and reminiscences of favorite haunts in
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, tlie writer says of her chosen title : '' Genius Loci .

		A divinity , certainly , great or small as the case may be , and deserving of some silent worship .

		But .

		for mercy 's sake , not a personification ; not a man or woman with mural crown and attributes , and detest - able definite history , like the dreadful ladies who sit round the
Place de la Concorde	ORGANIZATION	.

		To think of a place or a country in human shape is , for all the practice of rhetoricians , not to think of it at all .

		No , no .

		The Genius Loci , like all worthy divinities , is of the sub - stance of our heart and mind , a spiritual reality . ''

		Her '' fantastic tales '' are suggested in each instance by some scrap of mediaeval legend , or bit of art , or relic of antiquity : and the treatment has always jwetic grace and romantic flavor , even though the supernatural , the weird , and occasionally the grue - some and horrible , tend to predominate .

		As fairy tales they are too highly wrought , too much embel - lished with learned allusions and far-fetched con - ceits , to please younger readers -- for whom they were doubtle-ss not intended ; but for those who care more for exquisite form than solid substance these airy creations of a rich and lively imagination are excellent reading .

		A new biographical series dealing o/i ' ^ eyTca ' '' ^ with the lives of '' Leading Ameri - cans '' has been planned under the promising editorship of Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	.

		The series opens well with '' Leading American Soldiers '' by Mr.
R. M. Johnston	PERSON	, whose books on
Napoleon	PERSON	have shown his training and skUl as a writer .

		Thirteen generals are selected for discus - sion , --
Washington	LOCATION	and
Greene	PERSON	from the Revolu - tion ,
Jackson	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	, and
Scott	PERSON	from the middle period .

		Grant ,
Sherman	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	,
McClellan	PERSON	, and
Meade	PERSON	from the North , and Lee ,
Jackson	PERSON	, and
J. E. Johnston	PERSON	from the South .

		From fifteen to sixty - five pages are given to each subject , including the main facts of his life and an outline of his campaigns , with intelligent criticism of them .

		Tliis criticism , though briefly expressed , is the valuable feature of the book and makes it worth a careful reading , especially by those who have accepted the tradi - tional opinions found in the popular histories .

		There is necessarily some repetition of facts in the ti-eatment of the eight generals of the Civil War , but the emphasis is dift ` erent in each case as a dif - ferent soldier occupies the centre of the stage .

		Volumes of the series are announced on our leading scientists , historians , lawyers , novelists , and others , to be written by men whose work is known and approved .

		-LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Professor
W. C. Bagley	PERSON	's new book fhXaiher ° ^ '' Classroom Management '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- will be useful to any teacher who has not solved all his practical problems , and particularly valuable to the j' oung teacher .

		The great virtue of the book is its actuality ; its material has been gathered mainly from experience and ob - servation .

		The writer constantly sums up the best expert opinion upon the question in hand , and while not without decided opinions of his own , expresses them with modesty and fuU recognition of the great range of belief upon most practical questions .

		The contents of the book may be suggested by a few of the chapter titles : '' The Daily Program , '' '' Hy - gienic Conditions in the Schoolroom . ''

		`` Order and Discipline , '' '' Penalties , '' '' The Problem of At - tention . ''

		The thought is sane and illuminating throughout , and the form is always clear and strong .

		We know of no other book that will bring more varied and abundant help to the teacher in actual hand-grips with his task .

		LIST OF X'EW BOOKS 18 `` BOOKS OF T HE CO MING YEAR .

		The present issue of The Dial contains the list of publishers ' announcements , duly ela.ssified .

		which we are accustomed to prepare at this sea - son of the year .

		It is a long list and a varied one .

		with titles that should whet almost even * kind of literarj '' appetite .

		A hasty examination of this list reveals mah > ' announcements of much interest , and we have here selected -LRB- also in ac - cordance with our annual custom -RRB- a few of the books which are likely to be awaited with some - thing more than ordinary eagerness .

		Our selec - tion is confined to the five categories of general literature , history , biography , poetry , and fiction .

		Among the volumes scheduled for early ap - pearance probably none is more important than those of the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature , '' under the editorship of Messrs.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	and
A. R. Walker	PERSON	.

		This work , long in preparation , is upon the plan of the '' Cam - bridge Modem History , '' and will extend to fourteen volumes .

		It will be the work of many hands , for the subject has now far outgrown the cajMcity of any single scholar , and the opening volume . '

		■ From the Origins to Chaucer , '' is now practically ready for publication .

		In this con - nection , we may also mention ilr .

		W.
Robertson NicoU	ORGANIZATION	's forthcoming illustrated ' • History of English Literature , '' in three volumes .

		To the important '' Library of Literary History '' ' two new volumes will be added -- one on the Arabs by Mr.
R. A. Nicholson	PERSON	, and one on Franc-e by
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	.

		We are to have two new books , respectively entitled '' Great Writers '' and '' The Appreciation of Literature . ''

		by Pro- fessor
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	; and a volume by ProfeaBor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	on ' • The
France	LOCATION	of To-day '' -- a direct consequence of the author 's recent experience as a lecturer at the .

		Sorbonne .

		A few other books relating to literarj - history and criticism are the following : '' The Novels of Greorge Meredith . ''

		by Mr.
E. E. J. BaUey	PERSON	; • ` Inquiries and Opinions , '' by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; `` Studies in Poetry , '' by the Rev. Stop - ford
A. Brooke	PERSON	; '' The Elizabethan Drama , '' by Professor
F. E. Schelling	PERSON	: and '' The Greater English Poets of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' bv Dr.
W. M. Pavne	PERSON	.

		Among works of history , the various sets and 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, series already in progress make an impoi `` tant showing , but we will here take them for granted , and speak only of new enterprises .

		Three books of allied interest are the ''
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, 1763-1783 , '' of Mrs.
M. A. M. Marks	PERSON	, the '' British Colonial Policy ,
1754	DATE	-
1765	DATE	'' of Mr.
George L. Beer	PERSON	, and `` The Struggle for American Independence ' of Mr.
Sydney G. Fisher	PERSON	.

		A subject of peculiar in - terest , hitherto almost unexploited , has been found by Mr.
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	, who has written of '' Our Struggle for the
Fourteenth Colony	ORGANIZATION	:
Canada	LOCATION	and the American Kevolution . ''

		In Roman histoi-y we are to have '' Studies in the Early History of Ancient
Italy	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Ettoi-e Pais	PERSON	, and '' The Greatness and Decline of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	.

		A new '' Romance of History '' series promises well , being openetl by Major
Hume	PERSON	with ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	and Pliilip ; or , The Whole Story of the Spanish Armatla . ''

		This shovUd be as interesting as
Froude	PERSON	, and a good deal more trustworthy .

		The same author is also down for a work on `` The Court of
Philip IV.	PERSON	, the Decadence of
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		A few other titles of interest are Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's '' Call of the West :
America	LOCATION	and Elizabethan England ' '' ; '' The Mongols , '' by the late
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	; ''
Napoleon	PERSON	and the Invasion of
England	LOCATION	, '' by Messrs.
H. B. F. Wheeler	PERSON	and
I. M. Broodley	PERSON	; `` The Great Plains , 1527-1870 , '' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	; and '' The Gamesters of the WUdemess , '' a book about the romantic history of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Turning to biography , we find that we may soon expect in book form two works that have already attracted much attention during their publication as serials in the magazines .

		Readers who have followed their serial course do not need to be told how thoroughly delightful they will find the '' Reminiscences of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, '' and '' The Spirit of Old West Point '' by Mr.
Morris Schaff	PERSON	.

		Another announcement of exceptional interest is that of the '' Memorials of
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, '' the '' wandering scholar '' whose personality made so deep an impression upon all who knew him .

		Mr.
EUis P. Oberholtzer	PERSON	's life of ''
Jay Cooke	PERSON	, Financier of the Civil War '' is another American biography of more sober his - torical interest .

		In English biography , we note Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's life of WUliam
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	, Mr.
Frank Podmore	PERSON	's life of
Robert Owen	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward J. EUis	PERSON	's '' The Real
Blake	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
D. W. Rannie	PERSON	's ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	and his Circle . ''

		Three important French biographies are
M. Jides Lemaitre	PERSON	's
Rousseau	PERSON	, Mr.
Arthur Tilley	PERSON	's Rabelais , and the '' Memoirs of
Frederic Mistral	PERSON	. ''

		The '' Memories of My Life , '' by Mme.
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	, and the '' Memoirs and Artistic Studies of
Adelaide Ristori	LOCATION	'' are two books of allied interest that are sure to be widely read .

		A book ou Petrarch by Mr.
H. C. Hollway-Calthrop	PERSON	, one on Nietzsche by Mr.
Henry L. Mencken	PERSON	, and one on Ibsen by Mi - .


A. Boguslawsky	PERSON	, are three biographies that will appeal to students of literature . '

		It is our usual experience that the best new poetry comes miheralded , and we do not expect great things from the preliminary an - nouncements of the publishers .

		But we shall welcome Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's `` The Fire Divine , '' Mrs.
Helen Hay Whitney	PERSON	's '' Gypsy Verses , '' the '' New Poems '' of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, and '' The Pilgrim Jester '' by Mr.
A. E. J. Legge	PERSON	.

		And we shall be particularly glad to see the translation of
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		d'Annunzio 's '' La Figlia di Jorio '' and Miss
Agnes Tobin	PERSON	's new volume of translations from Petrai-ch .

		The novelists we have always with us , and in ever swelling hosts .

		We may select ten from each side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as representative ex - amples .

		American fiction will have the fol - lowing accessions : '' Between the Dark and the Daylight , '' by Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	; ''
Julia Bride	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; ''
Arethusa	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	; ''
Santa Fe	ORGANIZATION	's Partner , '' by Mr.
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	; ''
Beth Norvell	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	: '' The Fruit of the Tree , '' by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	: '' The Beaten Road , '' by Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	; '' The Princess Poui -- quoi , '' by Miss
Margaret Sherwood	PERSON	; '' Ances - tors , '' by Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	; and '' The Bond , '' by ''
Neith Boyce	PERSON	. ''

		From our '' kin beyond sea '' -LRB- never more fully our kin than when writing novels -RRB- we may expect these among others : ''
Helena	PERSON	's Path , '' by Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	: '' Merry Rockhurst , '' by Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton	PERSON	Castle ; '' The Broken Roatl , '' by Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	; '' Mayor Vigoureux , '' by Mr.
A. T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	; '' The Weavers , '' by Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; '' The Secret Agent , '' by Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	; '' The Stooping Latly , '' by Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	; '' The Helpmate , '' by Miss May Sinclair ; '' The Folk Afield , '' by Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	; and `` The Settlers of Karossa Creek , '' by Mr.
Louis Becke	PERSON	.

		The fiftieth anniversary number of the '' Atlantic Monthly '' is to be issued in
November	DATE	.

		It will include articles by three ex-editors -- the late
Thomas Bailey Aldrieh	PERSON	,
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, and
Walter H. Page	PERSON	; and also reminiscent essays by
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	and
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 CASUAL COMMENT .

		Tboixope the pbollfic -- or .

		as his readers are somerimes tempted to call him .

		Trollope the prolix -- is made the subject of an interesting article by the editor of `` The Bemer Oberland . ''

		who visited and interviewed the famous novelist 's son Henry at the latter 's sommer home under the shadow of the Jung ^ frau . ''

		My father had a warm heart for
America	LOCATION	, '' declared Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	.

		• • Of what he wrote it is strange that I hear in this obscure little place , through which pass many of your fellow - countrymen , more keen understanding and delight - ful love for my father 's books than I ever heard from Englishmen .

		You Americans are wonder - fully well informed concerning our authors and their works . ''

		As to the novelist 's literary methods , '' he once said that he would always give the big public what they preferred .

		-- if the public insisted on having Lady Glencores and Johnny EJuneses .

		he would continue to manufacture them I He con - stantly wrote -- wrote -- wrote ' .

		He always had something ready for a publisher when he called , and something to suit ... My father could sit down at any time and write for hours with hardly lifting his pen from the paper .

		His prolificness was amazing .

		He was a well-read man .

		He read some - thing everj - morning of his life before beginning his own composition . ''

		His conception of literary inspiration is well known .

		• • As for literary labor , he had no patience with those fellows who wait for inclination ' .

		In his mind the surest aid to the writing of a book is a piece of cobbler 's wax on the chair -- sitting at it and to get at the desk day by day ! ''

		Truly Trollope is even more interesting than any of his stiU-famous characters , not except - ing the wonderful she-bishop , Mrs.
Proudie	PERSON	; and his way of producing fiction by the pound ever -RCB- - morning before breakfast , and before his serious professional labors of the day , was indeed astonish - ing .

		The wonder is that his stories have as much swing and verve as they have .

		Not one novelist in a thousand could keep so excellent a vintage of romance forever on tap ; it would grow mustv .

		or tast `` of the cask .

		... OscAK
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's revivixg POPtrLAKmr is some - thing remarkable , especially on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Trustworthy report tells of his works now actively selling in French .

		German , and Italian trans - lation , except that the plays -LRB- not including `` Sa - lome '' -RRB- appear to be less in demand than the novels , poems , and es * ays .

		On the stage , however , the plays , especially `` Salome , '' meet with increasing favor .

		Wilde 's writings lend themselves readilj - to transla - tion .

		-- above all in French , a language that he him - self spoke and wrote like a native : and even in the heavier German he has found hardly less effective rendering .

		The contrast between the gloomy trag - edy of this author 's life and the amazing brilliancy of his genius seems to possess unfailing charm for European readers : and it is characteristic of the French to think none the less of his art because of the stain on his morals -- just as it is equally char - acteristic of the Britons to assame a eontrary attitude .

		But even in
London	LOCATION	the
summer	DATE	now closing has seen a successful revival of '' A Woman of no Import - ance , '' under Mr.
Tree	PERSON	's management , with -LRB- actu - ally -RRB- the pla ^ - wright 's name on the programme .

		This was probably the first public recognition of Oscar Wilde in
England	LOCATION	since his disgrace .

		Byron and
Poe	PERSON	are sometimes linked with WUde in literarj - criticism and discussion : and it is undeniably true that with - out the lurid streak that ran through the character of each his genius would not have commanded the world 's fascinated attention as it has .

		Genius , like sin , has an element of the imaccountable , the irra - tional , and it has long been conjectured that the two have a mysterious connection that must forever baffle our comprehension .

		Yet few would have the hardihood to maintain that the fair flower of genius is rooted in iniquity ; rather do we like to believe that the highest art and the highest virtue are closely akin .

		• • •
The Gekmax Librabt Association	ORGANIZATION	'' displays far len energy and zeal when the time for its annual meeting comes round than are manifested on corre - sponding occasions in this coimtry and
England	LOCATION	.

		Earnest and active though they may be individu ^ v. and each at his own desk and serving his own com - munity , the librarians of
Germany	LOCATION	do not assemble in mukitodes at conventions ; but it would be no hazard - ous conjecture to attribute a large part of this seeming sluggishness to the pitiful smallness of the German library-worker 's salary .

		We recall an assistant libra - rian at the
Gottingen University Library	ORGANIZATION	, who , though he was a doctor of philosophy and possessed a wide knowledge of literature , received an exiguous stipend that would hardly have hired a boy to run for bidoks in one of our libraries .

		Therefore , from the fact that only sixtv ' - six are reported as attending the late convention at
Bamberg	LOCATION	we need not conclude that
Bihliatheksweaen	PERSON	is in a parlous state in the Empire .

		A lack of cooperation and associate interest must undoubtedly exist where so few of those engaged in the same work can manage to rub elbows once a year , and where , as we read , out of the eighty persons en - gaged in carrying on the Prussian university libra - ries , only one delegate was in attendance at
Bamberg	LOCATION	.

		But for aD that , when it comes to circulating books among the people , the German public librarian , as we hare already indicated in these columns , shows himself no sineeurist .

		For example , the public libra - ries of
Berlin	LOCATION	, according to their latest annual report , issue a million and a third volumes yearly .

		The
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, serving probably a larger number of readers , does not very much exceed this .

		• • • RiCHAKD Maxseield AS A jouKXAUBT is remem - Wred now by only a scattering one or two , whUe
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	the actor is held in fond remem - brance by thousands .

		The biographers have mostly ignored this phase of the young
Mansfield	PERSON	, though several mention his unsuccessful or unsatisfactorv 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, start in business .

		A journalist no longer young , whose memory goes back to
Boston	LOCATION	newspaperdom of the seventies , has a distinct remembrance of young Richard
Mansfield	PERSON	doing all-round work on a small
Boston	LOCATION	paper now long extinct .

		Possibly others may be still alive who recall the future actor as haunting newspaper offices and as exhibiting far more shyness and less haughtiness than characterized his later years .

		These journalistic reminiscences , which have lately found their way into the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' speak of the unfledged artist as doing , among other newspaper work , dramatic and musical criticism -- without , however , astonishing the dramatic and mu - sical world .

		But one of his essays in this field did attract a measure of attention : it was one wherein he aimed the shafts of liis satire at an inanimate , but sufficiently conspicuous , target , -- the bass drum of a theatre orchestra . ''

		Mansfield , '' we are told , '' read the pounder of sheepskin a severe and wordy lecture on his ignorance of the dynamic value and capability of the instrument as exhibited that night at that per - formance .

		That was not the era of detailed criti - cisms , and the idea of preaching to the bass drum tickled the risibility of the profession , although it was natural that the sensibilties of one who was no mean musician himself , and the son of a famous singer as well , should be acute to defects that other critics ignored as all in the day 's work . ''

		Even in this all-but-foi ` gotten incident we seem to recog - nize the
Mansfield	PERSON	of `` Richard III . ''

		and `` Beau Brummel '' and `` Jekyll and
Hyde	PERSON	, '' -- the strenu - ous insister upon perfection , as he conceived it , in every minutest detail .

		Small sands the mountain , moments make the year , and trifles -- the finished artistic product .

		... Twenty years of Esperanto have now been rounded out , for it was in
1887	DATE	that Dr.
Zamenhof	PERSON	published his invention to the world .

		Since then the tongue has been spreading with cunmlative rapidity , hundreds of clubs have been formed for its systematic study , two international congresses of Esperantists have met , and this mid-August sees a third in session .

		We Americans are especially called upon by Dr.
Zamenhof	PERSON	to take up Esperanto and promote its adoption as a world language . ''

		O Americans , '' he cries , in a pamphlet addressed to us , '' this language , whose ideal is the future imion of mankind , we hand on to you in the name of freedom , peace , and justice , for which the forefathers of most of you suffered so much . ''

		Let us hope that he and Mr.
Stead	PERSON	may succeed in galvanizing into life this ingenious creation of the brain of man , and let us also pray that it may not develop into a linguistic
Frankenstein	LOCATION	, a terror to its fellow-tongues of natural origin , and a monster ravaging the fair fields of litr erature with fearful and wonderful translations and still more direful attempts at original composition .

		The cunning of art has gone so far that , as we are told , flowers are now manufactured that , for certain decorative purposes , are preferable to those that grow in garden and hot-house ; yet there is small danger that
Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	's trade in roses and lilies and violets will perceptibly suffer .

		Likewise we hardly need fear that , with the spread of an artificial lan - guage , the vernacidar will fall into disuse , or that the pleasure and profit of studying a foreign tongue will cease to be recognized .

		• • • A suggestion for a story of thrilling interest is furnished by the recent tragic and heroic death of four Russian military baUoonists in the
Gulf of Finland	LOCATION	.

		The air-ship , sent up for military purposes from the aeronautic park near
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, was carried out to sea with its four occupants , and soon began to sink untU the car was in danger of being plunged into the water .

		Thereupon the four balloonists took out a Tontine life-insurance policy of a novel sort , whereby it was hoped that one or more would profit by the death of the remainder , the premium being dear life itself .

		Drawing lots , three of the men , one after another as the situation demanded , leaped into the sea , thus lightening the balloon and giving it a longer lease of life .

		But the last survivor enjoyed his survi - vorship only a short time .

		He too was drowned , and the water-logged balloon , with a written message in the car telling the fate of the four unfoi ` tunates , was picked up by a passing vessel .

		Without very nmch remodeling or trimming , this would make a good short story , or an effective chapter in a novel .

		But it would be advisable to let one man survive , and in fact to let him tell the harrowing tale in his own person .

		After all , however , is there not something cold-blooded and inhuman in making literary capital out of that terrible agony in the desolate expanse of the northern seas ?

		How little can any descrip - tive powers enable us to realize the horror of such an event I ... Another projected memorial solicits our at - tention and our contributions .

		It is proposed to erect in
St. Giles 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	,
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, a suitable monument to the memory of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	; and the committee having the matter in charge includes such persons of note as Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	,
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	, Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	. ''

		A certain

		* The recent death of
Adelaide Ristori	ORGANIZATION	will give interest to Mr.
Mantellini	PERSON	's new and lavishly illustrated translation of her ''
Ricordi	PERSON	e
Studi Ai-tistici	PERSON	, '' which first appeared twenty years ago and was immediately rendered into English , French , and other European languages .

		But in offering this new version the publishers and the translator have not dealt quite fairly with the unwary public : they present the book as something new .

		now first translated at the writer 's request .

		How else cau we interpret the following from Mr.
ManteUini	PERSON	's Preface ?

		-LRB- We retain the peculiar pimctuation of the original . -RRB- ''

		Her autobiography , I offer ren - dered into English to the American public , primarily to gratify her own desire expressed in one of her letters addressed to Mr.
L. D. Ventura	PERSON	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, who has graciously volunteered to add some of his Biographical Reminiscences as an appendix to this work ,
Madame Ristori	PERSON	says : ' My intention is to have my Memoirs published in English .

		Do you believe that such a book would receive a welcome in the
United States	LOCATION	? ' ''

		What Ristori actually .

		said m her letter , which is printed at the end of the volume , was : '' My intention is to have the book published in En - gland with Italian quotations and original text , and vice versa in
Italy	LOCATION	... Do you believe that this book would receive a welcome in the
United States	LOCATION	if I had it published there in English ? ''

		This was wi-itten in
1885	DATE	, when the wi'iter was planning a simultaneous publication of her book in several languages .

		The Italian quotations that appeared in the original -LRB- author - ized -RRB- English vei ` sion have for the most part been either omitted or published only in trans - lation by Mr.
Mantellini	PERSON	.

		Without the Italian original at hand for pur - poses of comparison , it is impossible to declare positively whether the present version is an im - provement on the anonymous rendering which was published in
London	LOCATION	almost immediately after the
Turin	LOCATION	issue of the Italian , and which seems to have hatl the benefit of the author 's supervision and correction ; but frequent in - stances of awkwardness in the later version , not a few of obvious blundering , and many apparent • Memoirs and

		departures from the text , tend to inspire in the reviewer a lack of confidence in the translator 's faithfulness and skill .

		Moreover , the six chap - ters of the
1888	DATE	version of the ''
Ricordi	PERSON	'' are here re-divided into ten , while the six chapters of ''
Studi Artistici	PERSON	'' are re-arranged in a dif - ferent order .

		Some attempt , too , appears to liave been made , by slight omissions and other - wise , to give the memoirs an up-to-date aspect ; and these efforts have not always had happy re.sidts .

		But whether the alterations and refur - bishings are aU attributable to the translator , or some of them to the actress in
her later years	DATE	, we can not say .

		What makes the volume es - pecially welcome at this time is the appended contribution from Mr.
Ventura	PERSON	-LRB- remembered perhaps for liis Italian readings in
Boston	LOCATION	and elseivhere , if not for his published writings -RRB- who was somewhat intimately acquainted with his gifted vomj -RRB- atriote .

		From his pen we wiU quote a little anecdote showing that , from whatever source
Adelaide	LOCATION	derived her genius , it was not from her father .

		The story may be old , but is worth repeating . ''

		The father , though a good man , was a poor actor , and had very little intelligence .

		Once when leaving
Cologne	LOCATION	,
Adelaide	LOCATION	caught him carrying an enonnous quantity of quart bottles . '

		Papa , ' she asked , ' What is in those bottles ? ' '

		You ought to know , ' he answered with importance : '
Cologne	LOCATION	water . ' '

		But where did you get it ? ' '

		Well , ' said he candidly , ' from the place where other people take it , the fountain in the square . ' ''

		Daughter of strolling players ,
Adelaide Ris	LOCATION	- tori became herself a strolling player in the largest sense .

		Though she at first shrank from essaying a rbh in a foreign tongue , her tours in foreign lands were many and extended ; and not a few must be still alive who saw her in her prime on the American stage .

		She seems always to have spoken and ^ v ^ itten admiringly of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But of what country or person did this great-hearted woman ever indulge even an unkind thought ?

		The subjoined account of a rather noteworthy dramatic performance in
New York	LOCATION	is worth reprinting from the closing pages of her memoirs .

		The time referred to is the
spring of 1885	DATE	, when
Ristori	PERSON	was visiting this country for the fourth time , and was playing in English , which she had but recently acquired after most painstaking exertion . ''

		Encouraged by such results -LSB- referring to a memo - rable Booth-Ristori performance of '
Macbeth	PERSON	' -RSB- the management of the permanent German Dramatic Com - pany , playing at tliat time at the Thalia Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	, offered me the most alluring inducements to play , on the night of the 12th ,
Schiller	PERSON	's '
Mary Stuart	PERSON	' in
Enghsh	LOCATION	, while the actors of that company who were to be my support shoidd play in German !

		THE DIAL 161 a proposition seemed U > me a most preposteroua tmt !

		I knew not a single word of German .

		Still , I confeas that the originality of the scheme was rather tempting .

		I finally came to the conclusion that by giving a good deal of attention to the expression of the faces of my interlocutors and with an analogous counterscene at the time when I did not have to speak , I might be able to get along without becoming confused .

		After a short hesitation I accepted the offer of the management , and the strange event was witnessed in
America	LOCATION	of an Italian actreas playing in English with a German sup - port !

		... On the evening of the perf ormanc-e every - thing went along with regularity , and the performance was verv warmly applauded , and -- strange illusion -- the oreater part of the American andienee left the theatre fully convinced that I was fa mi l iar with the German language ! ''

		Ri.stori knew -- no one better -- that art is long .

		The record of her endless efforts to per - fect herself in her various roles would almost persuade the doubter that genius is nothing but an infinite capacity for taking pains .

		Her con - scientious attention to what might be considered trifles is illustrate < l in the following extract from 3klr .

		Ventura 's reminiscences : '' While I was in
Boston	LOCATION	delivering my annual course of Italian readings to a class named the ` Adelaide Ristoii , ' which used to meet at the home of Mrs.
Jack Gardner	PERSON	in
Beacon Street	LOCATION	, Ristori always attended during her engagements , and stayed to hmcheon .

		Like
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	for French .

		Ristori gave a great im - pulse to the study of Italian in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In a conversation with
Adelaide Ristori	ORGANIZATION	I asked why she used glasses for reading . '

		I like the compliment of that question , ' she answered . '

		My sight became feeble after several continuous performances of '' Macbeth . ''

		In the sleep-walking scene for twenty minutes I had to keep my eyes wide open , riveted on one point , with the glare of the footlights before me .

		After the performance tears would constantly How from my poor eyes , and this brought on their present condition . ' ''

		She has elsewhere written that she did not allow herself even to wink in this sleep-walking scene -- an almost incredible exertion of will-power .

		A letter to ilr .

		Ventura , written when .

		she was busy with preparations for the publication of her book , contains a reference that the reader of Mr.
Mantellini	PERSON	's translation can easily under - stand .

		> ^ I shall not excuse my silence by saying that letters which I wrote you must have been lost on the
Oregon	LOCATION	-- it would be too vulgar .

		I have not written because I have not been able .

		Many times I had the desire to write , but yon can not imagine how much the publica - tion of my book occupies and preoccupies me .

		I get crazy with the English translation because I wish it to express what / mean to say , and not to vent the British ideas .

		I have to compare it with the French edition liefore passing it to the copyist . ''

		To the already published lives of
Adelaide Kistori	LOCATION	this new edition of her memoirs , with its appended letters coming down nearly to the date of her death , is a u.sefid supplement .

		But there is still room for a final .

		fuU , and critical account of the remarkable actress , prepared with far more care than the volume under review .

		The frequent occurrence of such errors -LRB- small , to be sure , but in the aggregate vexatious ^ as '' some later years '' for '' • some years later , '' • • bagnoire '' ' for '' baignoire . ''

		and '' proposi - tion '' for ' • proposal , '' and a conspicuous disre - gard of the rules of punctuation , tend to beget su.spicion of carelessness in larger matters also .

		In one respect , however , the new translation is superior to the old : it is provided with an index .

		It also has thirty-four portraits , of Ristori at different ages and in various characters , and of contemporary dramatic artists and other celeb - rities .

Thk Presitst Status of Dar-wtxism	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Modem biology dates from
1859	DATE	, the year of the publication of
Darwin	PERSON	's '' Origin of Species . ''

		This work , with its rig ^ d adherence to scientific method and with its imparalleled accmnidation of facts bearing on the life and interrelations of species of animals and plants , settled once for all the question as to the origin of species by natural derivation from preexisting forms .

		The old view of special creation was rel ^ ; ated to the history of mystical philosophy .

		Moreover , in natural selection was found the first rational explanation of the process by which the trans - mutation of species might be accomplished .

		As used by
Darwin	PERSON	, the term natural selection , referring primarily to the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence , yet included by implication aU other natural -LRB- that is , non - I mystic ^ -RRB- influences which might be supposed to cooperate in the same work .

		The Lamarckian principle of the inheritance of ontogenetic char - acters , the effects of isolation and sc ^ rt ^ tion , with other cooperating influences , natural not ■ metaphysical , were included in the general con - ceptionof natural selection .

		The essential fact in
Darwin	LOCATION	's mind , as he himself has clearly stated , was the establishment of the fact of descent , his own theory as to its method being , to him , a matter of secondary importance .

		The general acceptance of the theory of descent by all men competent to judge was due to the fact that the work of each of these men , under

		162 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, jjendent eoiToboration of the views of life Dar - win advocated .

		The theory of descent once accepted , the attention of naturalists was next directed to the processes by which differentiation of type was supposed to be produced .

		The work of
Weismann	PERSON	was epoch-making in this regard .

		We owe to him the moi'e rigid definition of natural selection , by which the Lamarckian element , the supposed inheritance of characters not inborn , was eliminated from the definition of Darwinism .

		To
Weismann	PERSON	also we owe the most successful attempt to give a physical basis to our conceptions of heredity and variation .

		By
Weismaim	PERSON	, natural selection , or Darwinism in the strict sense , was brought into the foregi'ound of evolutionary discussion .

		Allmuc/it , or universal potency , was claimed for it on the one hand , while on the other there were many who relegated it to a secondary place or to no place at all in their theories of evolu - tion or of species-forming .

		Another epoch-making work in the history of evolution , which has received far less atten - tion than it deserves , is that of
Moritz Wagner	PERSON	on the factor of space isolation -LRB- soiulerlirhc Hdummif/J , as an element in the production of distinct species .

		Still another ejKJch of inves - tigation was opened by
Eimer	PERSON	through his theory of orthogenesis , and still others of pros - pectively gi ` cat imjjortance by the revival of the investigations of
Mendel	PERSON	and by De Vries 's studies in the mutations of plants .

		In his latest volume , Professor
KeUosa	PERSON	- lias given a cai-efid digest of each and all of these many contributions to the theory of evolution since
Darwin	PERSON	's time , and of the multitude of lines of investigation which these various the - ories have suggested .

		In the matter of pains - taking justice the work is deserving of the highest praise .

		Its critical estimates are eminently wise and fair , while the literary style of the work is admirably lucid .

		Among the shrill voices from
Germany	LOCATION	in - sisting on the one hand on the Allmacht of selec - tion , and on the other that the Sterhelnger -LRB- deathbed -RRB- represents the present status of
Darwinismus	LOCATION	, it is fortunate for a layman as well as for the investigator to have at hand a guide so steady-headed as Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	.

		Taking natural selection or Darwinism as a '' rational causo-mechanical explanation of the origin of new species , '' Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	gives an analysis of the facts on which this explanation rests .

		Three chapters foUow on '' Darwinism attacked , '' the views of those writers '' who deny in toto any effectiveness or capacity for species - forming on the part of natural selection , '' and those who see in natural selection an effective factor , but deny to it the ^ ' ■ Allmacht of sjjecies control '' being one after another fuUy consid - ered .

		Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	throughout the volume avoids any extreme jwsition of his own .

		Al - though from his own work in the exjDerimental biology of insects illustrations and opinions are freely
dra %	PERCENT	vn , in general he ranges himself with the majority of naturalists , who find very much in natural selection but do not see in it the mas - ter key to all the riddles of life .

		He seems well aware tliat it is easier to argue against any theory than to construct another to take its place .

		It takes but few facts to form the basis of destructive criticism ; it takes very many to build up a satisfying explanation of any of the phenomena of life .

		In the chapters on Darwinism defended , ap - preciation is given to the fact that nearly all of the objections to Darwinism were foreseen by
Darwin	PERSON	himself and frankly answered as fully as the condition of scientific knowledge permitted .

		Of the various modern defenders of
Darwin	PERSON	- ism , the first place is naturally given to
Ludwig Plate	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- '' Ueber die Bedeutung der Darwinischen Selection-Prinzip '' -RRB- whose treatment of vexed questions is especially lucid and broad-minded .

		The rest of the volume is given to a discus - sion of alternative and auxiliary theories , the one a category of hypotheses intended to replace the theory of natural selection , the other of further hypotheses intended to give the Dar - winian theory atlditional strength .

		Most of these hypotheses contain a certain amount of truth , which is equivalent to saying that the problem is not one resting on the operation of a single factor .

		Most important of these are the theories of the effects of isolation or segi'egation , of which
Moritz Wagner	PERSON	was the most promi - nent champion , but which liave received the support of practically all serious students of geogi-aphical distribution .

		In
Wagner	PERSON	's view , this theory rendered unnecessary the conception of natural selection , to which fact we may per - haps attribute the undeserved neglect his writ - uigs have receivetl .

		Most naturalists at present regard the effects of isolation as cooperating with those of competitive selection .

		These words of
Ortmann	PERSON	express fairly the general attitude of students of distribution and isolation : '' The four factors named , -- variation , inheritance , selection , and separation , -- must work together in order to form different species .

		It is impos - sible to think tliat one of these should work by itself or that one eoidd be left a-side . ' ''

		It is

		163 absolutely certain that no theory - of the origin I of species which neglects the factor of isolation or which ignores the feots of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	.


Gulick	PERSON	.

		and their colleagues , can be complete or satis - factory .

		Important in the same connection are the theories of De Vries and his followers , that species originate not from the choice among fluctuating ^ - ariations -LRB- Darwinism -RRB- , or from geographic ^ isolation , but rather through dis - tinct leaps or saltations , called by De Vries '' mutations . ''

		The modification or final adap - tation of species to their environment would in either case be a matter for natural selection .

		In spite of the most important study of pedi - greed plants inaugurated by De Vries , and in spite of the many new fields of investigation which his theories have opened , the theorj - of mutation as a universal method of species - forming , has but a scanty basis , -- as compared for example with the enormous array of illus - trations at the ser \ `` ice of
Wagner	PERSON	and his followers .


Weismann	PERSON	's theory of
Panmixia	LOCATION	is fidly treated by Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	, although it is not found a very satisfactory explanation of the phe - nomena of degeneration of organs .

		Equally unsatis ^ - tory Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	finds the the - ory of inherited disuse of parts , and a laige class of facts certainly involved in the process of evolution are by a sort of common consent left without final explanation .

		Typical of these is the inherited blindness of fishes in caves , and also the various phenomena the heredity of vesrigial structures generally .

		The present status of Lamarckism is fully treated , -- in one sense s \ - mjjathetieally , though the author recognizes that no Lamarckian -RSB- phenomena-inheritance of characters not con - j genital is yet proved in fact .

		^ eismann `` s theory of germinal selection , De Vries 's theory of intracellular Pangenesis , and a number of other • • atomic theories '' of cell structure are clearly explained .

		As to these the author makes the following wise sug - gestion : '' Thas baldly ... stated these theories of nltiiiiate plasm stmetore ... show unfortunately onlj llieir fanhmtic # iee .

		For as it i : s in precisely showing how the postulated structure and properties are perfectly consonant with all the known phenomena of life that these theories have their actual interest and strength , a fantastic and improbable face shown as to this robs them of all interest .

		... It is only fair to say that the mgenuity und plausibility , the precise and exhanstive development of detail of some of these theories , are really dangerons to a layman who first happens to read a full and well stated account of them bv an enthusiastic apholder .

		One 's eyes become closed to the fact that all the structure and performauee that seem so natural and fit in so exactly with all that we actuaUy know of the phenomena of life have not been seen , only imagined .

		* ' Finally , we have an excellent discussion of
Eimer	PERSON	's theoiy of Orthogenesis , and of the ^ • arious related and uncompleted theories which try to explain the fact that in palaeontological history the evolution of many groups has fol - lowed what may be termed straight lines , as though there were a pre-arranged or determi - nate series of \ - ariations .

		What these facts may finally prove to mean is still uncertain , but we may agree with the author that
Eimer	PERSON	, ill - tempered and fond of dispute as he certainly was .

		was a man of the deepest insight and one who has earned an honorable place in the his - toiy of evolution .

		As to the realitj - of
Ortho	ORGANIZATION	- genesis and numerous other absorbing problems .

		Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	's attitude is that so concisely put by Professor
Brooks	PERSON	in regard to the dis - putes on the existence of \ ntal force : ' • We shall never know until we find out . '' ''

		The value of Profe & sor
Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	's book to the working student of Organic Evolution can not lie overestimated .

		It is a book the student must have at hand at all times , and it takes the place of a whole library .

		No other writer has attempted to gather together the scattered literature of this vast subject , and none has subjected this literature to such uniformly trenchant and uni - formly kindly criticism .

John Smith	PERSON	'' was borne in
Willoughby	LOCATION	in
Lincolneshire	LOCATION	, and a
Scholler	PERSON	in the two Free - schooles of Alford iuid
Louth	PERSON	. ''

		The exact date of his birth is not given , but it was appar - ently about the beginning of
January , 1579	DATE	.

		He was not yet out of his teens when the lust of travel took possession of him , and from that time until .

		the year
1617	DATE	, when he finally settled down in
London	LOCATION	to busy himself with the encouragement of American colonization by the production of maps and pamphlets , and the preparation of his more ambitious works , he wandered far and wide , throughout all the then little-known countries west and south of the
Mediterannean	LOCATION	, and over seas to the land of Pocahontas .

		He died in
1631	DATE	, at the age of fifty-two , twenty-two years of his life having been spent in travel .

		It would be fruitless here to enter into the question of
Captain Smith	ORGANIZATION	's veracity as an his - torian and autobiographer .

		The furious wrath of eminent scholars has played about that sub - ject , and the wise re \ aewer leaves it discreetly alone .

		After all , one may as well admit frankly that he is much less concerned with the value of these books as history than with their interest as literature .

		The facts of his - tory are obtainable elsewhere .

		There are many histories , but only one '' Historic of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' ; many autobiographies , but only one '' True Travels of Captaine
John Smith	PERSON	. ''

		If
John Smith	PERSON	prevaricated , he prevaricated boldly .

		He says : '' I am no Compiler by liearsay , but have beene a reall
Actoi	LOCATION	- ... That which hath beene iudured and passed through with hardsliip and danger , is thereby sweetened to the Actor , when he beconieth the Relator .

		I have deeply liazarded my selfe in douig and suffering , and why should I sticke to hazard my reputation in Recording ? ''

		If he was nervous , it was not because of a guilty conscience , but rather because he found the pen an unfamiliar weapon .

		Not every JiUius
Caesar	PERSON	can '' shine as cleare in his owne Commentaries as in the field . ''

		He confesses that the hand that was able to '' wield a weapon among the Barbarous '' might yet tremble in handling a pen '' among so many Judicious . ''

		Yet he found comfort -- in dedicating his His - toric to the gracious Duchess of
Richmond	LOCATION	-- in the reflection that heretofore '' Honorable and vertuous Ladies , and comparable but amongst themselves , have offred me rescue and protection in my greatest dangers .

		Even in fori'aine parts , I have felt reliefe from that sex .

		The beauteous Lady Tragabigzauda , when I was a slave to the Turkes , did all she could to secure me .

		When I ovei-eame the
Bashaw of Nalbrits	ORGANIZATION	in
Tartaria	LOCATION	, the charitable Lady Callamata supplyed my necessities .

		In the utmost of many extremities , that blessed Pokahontas , the great Kings daughter of
Virginia	LOCATION	, oft saved my life .

		When I escaped the cruelties of Pirats and most furious stormes , a long time alone in a small Boat at Sea , and driven ashore in
France	LOCATION	, the good Lady
Madam Chanoyes	PERSON	, bountifully assisted me . ''

		One so favored might well find courage for any exploit -- even to the writing of a book .

		And what delightful reading the book makes !

		What if
John Smith	PERSON	did occasionally sacrifice
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DLAJL 165 truth to pictaresqueness : Surely we are the gamers .

		At least he says , -- `` They brought him to
Meronoeomo	LOCATION	, where was Powhatan their Emperor .

		Here more than two hun - dred of those griiu Courtiers stood wondering at him , as he had beene a monster ; till Powhatan and his travne had put themselves in their greatest braveries .

		Before a fire upon a seat like a bedsted he sat covered with a great robe , made of Raroweuiu skinnes , and all the tayles hanging by .

		On either hand did sit a young wench of 16 or 18 yeares , and along on either side the house two rowes of men .

		... At his entrance before the
King	PERSON	, all the people gave a great shout .

		The
Queene of Appamatuck	ORGANIZATION	was appointed to bring him water to wash his hands , and another brought him a bunch of feathers , in stead of a
Towell	ORGANIZATION	to dry them : having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could , a long consoltation was held , but the conclu - sion was , two great stones were brought before Powhatan : then as many as could layd bands on him , dragged him to them , and thereon laid his head , and being ready with their clubs , to beate out his braines , Pocahootas the Kings dearest daughter , when no entreaty would prevaile , got his head in her armes , and laid her owne opon his to save him from death : whereat the Emperour wa `` contented he should live ... ' Tber say be bore a pleasant shew .

		Bat sure bis beart was sad . ' ''

		How he got back to
Jamestown	LOCATION	, and what he did there , may be read with interest , and per - haps with profit , in the famous • • Historie of
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		One is tempted to quote from
Captain Smith	ORGANIZATION	's ' • True Travels , '' if one only knew where to b ^ in and where to end .

		Let anyone read , say , his account of the sea-fight between the ship of
Saint Malo	PERSON	and the - \ rgosie of
Venice	LOCATION	, and he will follow
Captain Smith	ORGANIZATION	to the very end of his adventures .

		In a few vigorous words he brings the whole scene before us , -- - the chase , the fight , the sinking ship : as vi \ ` id a bit of description as will lie found anywhere .

		Turn then to the • ' Sea Grammar . ''

		Who woidd dream of finding entertainment in a manual of instruction to mariners ?

		Listen , then , to his accoimt of how to manage a fight at sea : '' A aaile , how beares she or stands shee , to wind - ward or lee - ward , set him by the Compasse ; be stands right ahead , or on the weather-Bow , or lee-Bow , let flie your colours if you have a consort , else not .

		Out with all your sailes , a steady man to the helme , sit close to keepe her steady , give him chase or fetch him up : he holds his owne , no , we gather on him .

		Captaine , out goes his flag and pendants , also his waste clothes and top armings ... Master how stands the chase ?

		Right on head I say ; Well we shall reach Him by and hy : What 's all ready .

		Tea , yea , every man to his charge , dowse your top-saile to salute biin for the Sea , hale him with a noise of trumpets ; Whence is your ship ?

		Of Spaine ; \ Vhence is yours ?

		We are of the Sea ; He waves us to lee-ward with his drawne sword .

King of Spaine	ORGANIZATION	, and springs his louse ; give him a chase piece with your broad side , and run a good berth ahead of him ... He payes us shot for shot ; Well , we shall require him ; What are you ready againe .

		Yea , yea .

		Try him once more as before .

		Done , done ... Edge in with him againe , begin with your bow peeces , proceed with your broad side , & let her fall off with the wind ... the wind veeres , the Sea goes too high to boord her , and wee are shot thorow and thorow , and betweene wind and water .

		Try the pump , beare up the helme .

		Master let us breathe and refresh a little . ''

		Who would dream of finding this sort of thing in a text-book ?

		And who would exchange Captain
John Smith	PERSON	for a score of veracious historians ?

America	LOCATION	.

		* The so-called neglected period of American history which extends from the b ^ ; inning of active colonization to the last and greatest of the inter-colonial wars has received most adniir - able treatment in the third volume of Mr.
Elroy M. Avery	PERSON	's '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	and Its People . ''

		Political events , including consti - tutional and governmental difficidties , economic progress , and social development , are all equally well attended to .

		Perhaps a little more might have been said of the dress and customs of the people , and of their literary aspirations , few thou ^ they were ; but that criticism aside , the reader has little to grumble at , for nowhere else in popular form can he find so vast a fund of valuable and interesting information accurately and entertainingly given .

		The colonial history of the Jerseys is usually regarded as prosaic in the extreme ; but Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has discovered in it points of dramatic interest , and has spared no pains to reveal them to us .

		He has discussed the real-estate trans - actions that began with the first indenture and came to a climax in the quintipartite deed , with considerable clearness and vivacity , thus ren - dering a great service to college students whose perplexity at this stage of their course in • • American History '' is often most embarrass - ing to the instructor .

		They can now read the drj - details in story form , and find them connected and comprehensible .

		Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has reached the same happy result , in point of clearness , in the case of the
Carolinas	LOCATION	; only there he has entered at large into the constitutional and * A HisTOBT or

		For example , he would account for the
South Carolinian	LOCATION	's advo - cacy of the doctrine of State Eights by a refer - ence to the training of an earlier generation in resistance to laws that were not to be found in a written code .

		In like manner , the emotional temperament that has so often moved the
Palmetto State	ORGANIZATION	to hasty action is ascribed , under the principles of heredity , to a strain of Huguenot blood .

		To all this we are willing to bow assent , provided we can find an equally satisfactory explanation for equally hasty ac - tions with less provocation in other
States	LOCATION	.

		Concern for the Indians , which was so marked in the first volume of our author 's work , is continued in this , the third ; and in connection therewith , we are made familiar with some very suggestive particulars respecting early projects for a union of the colonies .

		It is not generally known that
John Locke	PERSON	the philosopher , and
William Penn	PERSON	the philanthropist , were both interested in the subject , the one having sub - mitted '' a plan for a military dictatorship , '' the other '' one for a peaceful congress . ''

		In showing how most of the charters were originally framed for mere trading companies , and how the policy of the home government became , through the necessities of a political and economic situation , imperialistic , as well as in gathering together material on the atlminis - trative machinery of the Old Thirteen , vidth variations or exceptions as exhibited in the case of corporate colonies pointed out , Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has done some excellent work .

		The enumeration of officials and of their respective duties is use - ful .

		Oi ` dinarily we think little of the surveyor - general of the customs , and of the surveyor of the woods -- the wood-reeve of an earlier system ; but here we see that the position of each was no sinecure and had important consequences for the future .

		The illustrations in the book are very diverse in character , and add a great deal to its value as a reference work .

		They consist of title-pages of rare pamphlets , specimen pages or facsimiles of interesting documents , autographs , photo - graphs , coats-of-arms , seals , maps , jjlans , coins , and the like .

		So varied and so numerous are they that Mr.
Avery	PERSON	must have ransacked all the historical libraries of the seaboard States for them .

		It is a pity that he has sometimes thought it incumbent upon him to introduce an illustration without much apjiarent reason .

		For instance , the vaguest allusion to
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	seems to have called , in his opinion , for a repro - duction of '' a heliotype print of tlie original document in the British Museum . ''

		As in the earlier volumes , slang phrases , awkward sen - tences , poor arguments , and attempts at face - tiousness , are not infrequent .

		We seriously question whether the dignity of the nai-rative is enhanced by such expressions as '' his precious eight '' and '' his pious friends , '' both of which refer to the
Carolina	LOCATION	proprietors who stood in close social and political relations to
Charles II.	PERSON	, but who , so far as we know , made no preten - sions at piety , and were not hypocrites .

		Most writers content themselves with tracing the history of the
United States	LOCATION	back to the thirteen English colonies that extended along the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast ; but Mr.
Avery	PERSON	lias most commendably taken a broader view of his coun - try 's beginnings , and has introduced chapters on
Florida	LOCATION	and
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		This we note with genuine pleasui-e ; for , although these chapters do not contain a gi-eat deal of matter , nor any - thing really new , yet their introduction is decidedly a step in the right direction .

		For the same reason that we welcome them , however , we dislike to see a companion chapter on
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Details concerning
Canada	LOCATION	have logically no place , except by way of comparison or contrast , in '' A History of the
United States	LOCATION	and Its People . ''

		Should the union between the two countries ever occur , -- as newspapers of the more southern region anticipate with confidence , and the very idea of which the people of the more northern one reject with scorn , -- it will then be time enough to give the same attention to the St. Lawi-ence valley as can now be given with the highest propriety to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		The title given the closing sonnet of this sequence is `` The Captains of the Past . ''

		• ■ Brother of those who , ere our
England	LOCATION	threw Her arms around the world , steered ont to roam ` Neath sails of Wonder , o'er the trackless foam , I think I see them standing there with yon At azure gates within yon sky so blue .

		So pure , it seems like
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's own sapphire dome -- Standing and gazing on your wondrous home AVhere sleeps a hero 's dust -- the wild ' World 's View . '

		I hear them saying .

		-- those Captains of the Past , -- All of
Old England	LOCATION	's hero-pedigree .

		From him who drove the Spaniard from the sea To him who nailed his colours to the mast ' Pray God ye be not burying there the last Of

		These poems , with their generous hero-worship , and their embodiment of the author 's belief in
England	LOCATION	's ' ■ unique destiny as the great inspiring moral force of the world , '' are fully worthy of the hand that wrote `` The Coming of Love '' and '' • Christmas at the Mermaid . ''

		They are extended into a book of forty pages by means of an introduction and a few ex - planatory notes .

		From Mr.

		Thither , when on his heart he knew Death 's chilly finger laid .

		As close the eternal curtains drew , His dying fancies strayed . ''

		The principal contents of Mr.
Tylee	PERSON	's volume are devoted to poems on public men , and pieces in - spired by incidents of the South African War .

		The verse is smooth and pleasing , although its themes are often grim .


South Africa	LOCATION	and the men who made it supply Mr.
Lance Fallaw	PERSON	with themes for a good half of the poems called ''
Silverleaf	ORGANIZATION	and Oak . ''

		They are poems of enterprise and adventure beneath the
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Guard , Britons , guard as symbol The crucifix of flame , -- The shape that bids yon tremble At thought of hero-shame : The hue that 's clear and golden As heaven 's own minted ore .

		Type of the faith Thro ' scar and scathe Of some who 've passed before .

		The spirit of ages olden Has shown you sign anew ; Take for your test That crow ^ ning crest , As martyrs ' seed should do .

		Let the high Cross remind you Of whence your record runs -- Your fathers ' North behind you .

		And southward fare the sons ' . ''

		The feeling of Wanderlust receives fine expres - sion in the poem entitled '' The Spirit of Hidden Place.s , '' of which these are the opening stanzas : '' Over the mountain 's shoulder , round the unweathered cape .

		In lands beyond the skyline , there hides a nameless shape , -- Whether of fiend or goddess no mortal well may know ; But when she speaks -- with flushing cheeks , they one by one must go , '' To men in far old cities , scanniug the curious chart .

		Her voice would sound at
midnight	TIME	, like music in the heart ; Across the wrinkled parchment a glory seemed to fall .

		And pageants pass like shapes in glass along the pictured wall , ** She led the sails of
Lisbon	LOCATION	beyond the Afric shore .

		Winning a world of wonders by seas unknown before .

		She watched the sturdy captains of
Holland	LOCATION	's
India	LOCATION	fleet Planting their post on that grim coast where the two oceans meet . ''

		Mr.
Fallaw	PERSON	's '' English '' poems include lyrics in imitation of Shelley on '' The Eagle '' and '' The Rainbow , '' followed appropriately by `` The Sea - Nymph 's Lament for Shelley , '' a finely imaginative composition in which the poet is made welcome to the realms that lie in the depths of the sea .

		* ' Yes , thou shalt sing -- far sweeter than on earth Thy lay shall rise , though then ' t was half divine .

		The magic that in worlds unseen hath birth Transcends the mortal power that once was thine . ''

		Canon

		* Mattathias , '' and the group of pieces inspired by the Zulu compaign of
1879	DATE	, are poems which strongly suggest the spirited manner of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		A number of other pieces seem mainly Wordsworthian in their inspu-ation , and the
Lake Country	ORGANIZATION	provides their setting .

		Derbyshire and
Cornwall	LOCATION	are other regions cele - brated by the poet .

		These lines descriptive of a sunset on the Cornish coast are exceptionaUy pleas - ing , and may be taken as an example of

''

		A slender sheaf of `` Lyrics , '' by Mr.
Gerald Grould	PERSON	, which has lain too long unnoticed on our desk , yields a measure of golden grain far exceeding expectation .

		Mr.

		And sorrow and sin are not at all Matched with the things that truly are -- As though one set against a star The flung spray of the waterfall . ''

		Mr.
Gould	PERSON	is a lyrist of acceptance , of the joy of earth , and the fulness of life .

		His prevailing mood is portrayed in the following exquisite lyric : '' Give me one hour -- the years are young .

		There is all life to throw away .

		And all life 's songs are to be sung -- Sing me one song to-day , to-day . ''

		Here wi4 > the green trees and blue sky And winds about the woodland driven -- Can we let such a moment by As this , and hope to be forgiven ? ''

		O laughing eyes and serious brow , And mouth almost too sweet to kiss .

		Never was such a time as now .

		Such opportunity as this ! '

		• Give me your hands -- I '11 hold them long ; Give me your lips -- I 11 hold them fast ; Oh !

		there '11 be time enough for song Between the first kiss and the last ! ''

		Life is well worth having to all except the souls who brood over its ills . ''

		Better a wide and windy world , and scope For rise and downfall of a mighty hope .

		Than many little ills ; Better the sudden horror , the swift wrong .

		Than doubts and cares that die not , and tlie long Monotony that kills ; The empty dawns , pale stars and narrow skies -- Mean hopes , mean fears , mean sorrows , and mean sighs . ''

		There is a Meredithian zest in this strain that puts to shame the haunters of graveyards , and Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	would surely applaud the stanzas on `` The Earth-ChUd . '' ''

		Out of the red-brown earth , out of the grey-brown streams , Came this perilous body , cage of perilous dreams ; To the ends of all waters and lands they are tossed , they are whirled ; For my dreams are one with my body -- yea , one with the world . ''

		We shall hope to hear more of Mr.
Gerald Gould	PERSON	; if he is a young man , it is fairly safe to say that he has a future .

		We are still allowed to find Greek art more attractive than Roman ; but we must no longer slight the latter or feel dulness or depres - sion in its presence . ''

		What is now claimed for Roman art is an aesthetic advance -- a power , that is , of conveying to the spectator effects which the Greeks had not yet attempted or realized . ''

		Natur - ally , all of us had recognized the achievements of Roman portraiture , and some had felt , with
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, its occasional attainment of Renaissance charm .

		We realized , too , that Roman political supremacy had not only prolonged the life of Hellenism , but in a sense had also offered new subjects to Hellenistic art .

		We were equally well aware that by the time of Constantine plastic art had involved the vehicle , effective if a bit ungainly , that so long conveyed Christian doctrine and legend .

		We were likewise familiar with the all-powerful influence exerted by the monuments at
Rome	LOCATION	upon the spirits of the Renaissance : the testimony of
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	and the exam - ples of Michelangelo and
Raphael	PERSON	hardly need recall - ing .

		Upon all this , the members of the new school dwell with desirable emphasis ; nor can we value too

		But they add thereto the doctrine that Roman sculp - ture , working forward from its Hellenic heritage and not seldom with
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	hands , achieved a signifi - cant technical advance .

		They maintain that it ' • approached and practically solved the tridimen - sional problem , '' thus creating the '' illusionist '' style ; that it developed the `` continuous '' style , as seen , for instance , on
Trajan	ORGANIZATION	's colmun : and that ' • even in the decadent art of the third and fourth century it evolved new and important optic tendencies . ''


Collee	PERSON	- tively and in detail , the subject * offer an excellent battlefield , and the smoke will long hang thick be - tween the camps of the contending specialists .

		Mrs. Strong -LRB-
Eugenie Sellers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an enthusiastic member of the new school , and at times is so thorough-going in her advocacy that , rememl > ering her sex , one in - voluntarily recalls from the classical field another striking example of a clever woman 's devotion to German leadership .

		Inasmuch as her ability and attainments are so well known that unfavorable criti - cism can not be regarded as unfriendly , we must record the xmhesitating opinion that she could have written a much better book .

		Numerous infelicities may be due to the original employment of the matter for the lecture platform : but actual lapses from good usage can hardly be covered by the same charitable cloak .

		Surely , when the subject treated lies in the field of art we are entitled to an attractive and finished presentation : and it is an old dictum that the wise advocate should add the allurements of style to the compulsion of argument .

		Nevertheless , the work is so fresh , so suggestive , and so replete with the results of the latest research , that it will be a wel - come addition to the student 's library .

		The volume is corpulent , well Ulustrated , and '' workable '' : but there are too many misprints , even for a volume of four hundred pages bristling with technical terms and unfamiliar names .

		An itinerant Methodist preacher is b ^ kUh ^ ^ T ^ on '' ^ ^ ^ ^ t person we should expect to find possessed of a fine library of carefully selected old authors , and imbued with the true bibliomaniacal affection for them .

		Yet in Mr.
Frederic W. Macdonald	PERSON	, as evidenced by a little volume of unusual charm from his pen -- '' In a Nook with a Book '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- -- we do find such a person .

		Son and grandson of Methodist preachers , whose calling compelled a change of abode every three years , but who nevertheless were book - lovers and book-buyers , the author speaks of himself as f oUowing in their footsteps , although certain words of his j -RRB- ermit the inference that he and his librar \ - of two thousand volumes are now enjoying the quiet and security of a fixed abiding place .

		than tapestry , or hang ^ gs , though of cloth of gold , is a fair array of volumes , comely without , and full of life within : clothed not too meanly , nor yet too gaudily ; but , suitably to their rank and character , in the buckram , calfskin , vellum , or morocco that is fitting .

		No Act of Uniformity should have jurisdiction here , no sumptuary laws determine the material , the colour , the cost of a -LCB- book 's binding .

		Instinct -- cultivated instinct -- and a sense of the fitness of things , will on this sub - ject teach the book-lover more • than all the sages ; can . ' '' '

		While he writes understandingly of the I church fathers and historians , and of the Anglican divines , from
Latimer	PERSON	and
Jewell	PERSON	to
Mozley	PERSON	and Liddon .

		this ministerial book-lover can also gossip about
Pepys	PERSON	and Mrs.
Pioz.zi	PERSON	and
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, and is even caught quoting , with admirable effect , from
Eugene Field	PERSON	's '' Bibliomaniac 's Prayer . ''

		In short , this is the most brightly entertaining book about books that has fallen into our hands for a long time .

		Another old writing-table drawer has given up its musty packet of faded letters , and the happy finder ,
Louisa Countess Gtlnther GrOben	PERSON	, grand-daughter of the j letter-writer , now offers them to the world under j the title , ''
Ralph Heathoote	PERSON	: Letters of a Young ; Diplomatist and Soldier during the
Time of Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The writer of the letters appears to have been a thoroughly amiable young man , and warmly attached to his mother , to whom the correspondence is addressed .

		English on his father 's side , but born in
Bonn	LOCATION	and passing much of his early life at
Cassel	PERSON	, he studied at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, then visited
England	LOCATION	, was appointed Secretary to the British Legation at
Cassel	ORGANIZATION	, and returned thence to
England	LOCATION	, when his chief .

		Brook
Taylor	PERSON	, incurred the ill-will of the all-powerful
Napoleon	PERSON	and was forced to retire . ''

		The Brook Taylor Incident ' '' is made much of by the compiler of the volume .

		The more stirring and eventful part of
Heathcote	ORGANIZATION	's life began with his exchange of diplomacy for the army .

		He entered the English service as cornet in the Royal Dragoons , but soon rose to a position on the staff of Lord
Cathcart	PERSON	: saw something of actual warfare when as militarj - secretary he accompanied his commander to
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	: and served as staff officer in the
Peninsula	LOCATION
from 1809	DATE	to
1813	DATE	.

		The last letter is dated
Nov. 23 , 1814	DATE	.

		As a testimonial of filial affection , and as a record of the every-day life of a somewhat gifted young man in several lands and in various capacities , one hundred years ago .

		the correspondence has interest ; but its literary value is as slight as its historical im - portance .

		The fear of having his letters intercepted prevented the writer from sending any news of 170 THE DIAL -LSB-

Wp	ORGANIZATION	' ■ , .

		, ° .

		lines IS the purpose of a new series , entitled `` The Types of Literature '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Professor
William Allan Neilson	PERSON	.

		The intention is to '' devote each volume to the considera - tion of the characteristics of a single formal type , to describe its origins and the foreign influences that have affected it , and to estimate the litei-aiy value and historical importance of all the chief specimens tliat have been produced in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		No better beginning could have been made than with '' The Popular Ballad '' by Professor
Gummere	PERSON	, whose work on this subject lias made him the legiti - mate successor of Professor Child .

		In this book we have a statement of much that is already known to us from Professor
Gummere	PERSON	's other works .

		What is of especial interest here is the development of the relation which the ballad structure bears to the original choral throng .

		Incremental repetition , the advancing of the story by stages marked by repeated words or lines , is regarded as final proof of popular origin , and survives in three forms , as an effective expression of the situation , as a perfunctory mark of style , and as ballad commonplace . ''

		It is , '' as Professor
Gummere	PERSON	says , '' the genius of the ballad itself , formally expressed , springing from quite intelligible conditions of a singing , dancing , di'a - inatic festal throng ; hence the unique and ancient appeal of this stretched metre at its best . ''

		The ballads are aptly classified into six groups , -- the oldest ballads , ballads of kinship , the coronach and ballads of the supernatural , legendary ,
Border	ORGANIZATION	and greenwood ballads , so that a comprehensive survey of the whole field is obtained .

		In the treatment of sources Professor
Gummere	PERSON	holds that the epic material , except where local , may generally be regarded as borrowed , the dramatic material or '' action '' of the choral throng as original .

		The last chapter , on the worth of the ballads as poetry , is written cwi amove , but with that admirable scholarly restraint that marks all of Professor
Gumm	PERSON	ere 's work .

		In '' Lonewood Corner : A Country - Som . '

		rural , ^ Horizons '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , by Mr.
John Halshain	PERSON	, author of '' Idlehurst , we have another of those genially meditative , frankly first-personal collection of random observations and reflections that Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	has of late done so much to make us agreeably familiar with , and that almost anyone with the literary instinct and nothing in particular -LRB- but a good deal in general -RRB- to say can produce in a more or less acceptable form .

		Probably it is the most natural shape to be assumed by the one book that everybody is supposed to have it in him to write ; and as the aim of this kind of writing is not of the loftiest , so the chances of igno - minious failure are fewer than in more pretentious contributions to literatm ` e .

		Mr.
Halsham	PERSON	, moreover , is fortified against adverse criticism : the book is but a ijarergon ; his main business is with his onions , his Beurr ^ pears , his pansies and long-tailed columbines .

		He wisely holds that `` all authors would be the betr ter for an independence earned among saladings and worts . ''

		His chapters touch on persons of his neigh - liorhood and matters of parish interest or of wider public concern .

		Looking back some years , he la - ments that '' the frenzy of haste and the destruction of natural beauty continue at much the old rate ; but I think with even less protest raised than before : we are so far poorer as a people that we can not even think of affording ourselves an hour of clear leisure , or a piece of unspoiled country larger than a deer - park . ''

		Toward the end of his volume he sings the praises of old books , and says of his own library : `` Therefore my book-case contains as a basis , in all sorts of editions , from the safe comment of Gronovius to the jaunty gi-aces of
Gildersleeve	LOCATION	, the Greeks and Latins , pretty complete .

		I read through them at a steady plod , and when I reach the gate of horn in my several journeys , I presently turn about and begin again : and on the whole I get more pleasure from the dead languages -- spite of the drag of an inveterate hobble in construing -- than from any other sort of reading . ''

		There is much good browsing in the unpretentious pages of this modestly learned and pleasantly chatty writer .

		A leiirenriitative The book by Mr.
Edward L. Wells	PERSON	` nUlnl ^ n , , entitled ''
Hampton	PERSON	and
Reconstruc	PERSON	- ill the South .

		tion '' -LRB-
The State Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Colum	PERSON	- bia , S. C. -RRB- is , as the title indicates , mainly an account of the nomination and election in
1876	DATE	of General
Wade Hampton	PERSON	as governor of
South Carolina	LOCATION	on the '' straightout '' Democratic platform .

		Introduc - tory chapters give an account of
Hampton	PERSON	's ancestry , his early life and training , an appreciation of his character , and a sketch of his service as a Confed - erate general in the Civil War .

		In the last chap - ter the author speaks briefly of the later years of
Hampton	LOCATION	as
United States Senator	ORGANIZATION	and as retired citizen .

		The author , it would seem , is of Northern birth , was a Confederate soldier under
Hampton	PERSON	, and after the war lived in
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The best of the book is that relating to the latter part of the Reconstruction period and the restoration of constitutional government by President
Hayes	PERSON	.

		In these chapters the writer draws upon his own recol - lections as an eye-witness and frequent participant in the affairs described .

		The work is interestingly \ vritten , with perhaps too much moralizing , and con - tains an abundant store of good anecdotes .

		The account of the old age and death of
Hampton	LOCATION	is pathetic ; poverty bore hard upon him , and polit - ically he was submerged by the rising tide of '' democracy '' as it is now called .

		Hampton repre - sents the old ,
Tillman	PERSON	stands for the new .

		It is a pity that a fuller account is not given of
Hampton	LOCATION	's antebellum life ; but as it is , the book is welcome as the only life of the great
South Carolinian	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL .

		171 A leaf from Miss
Clara Barton	PERSON	's tantalizing scrap a ` JZ ` oifui of autobiography entitled - The woman .

		Storj ' of my Childhood '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is as wonderful as its writer : it is extremely interesting , and yet it hardly touches on those aptitudes and activities that all the world associates with her remarkable personality .

		She tells us how morbidly sensitive and shy she was as a child ; how her brother taught her to ride bare - back ; how she learned house-painting , including the grinding and mixing of her colors , and satinet - weaving in one of the earliest
New England	LOCATION	satinet mills ; how she learned to play with boys , and to throw a ball as well as any of them ; and how she took up school-teaching with fear and trembling , and was astonished and puzzled when at the close of the term her school was ranked first for excel - lence of discipline .

		To discipline she had not given a thought , and hardly knew what the word meant In describing her two years of nursing experience at the bedside of a disabled brother , she does touch on the main concern of her later life ; but one could read the book without a suspicion of its author 's real claim to world-renown .

		That this woman , almost a nonagenarian now , who has done so much hard work and dangerous work , was .

		as a girl , of the frailest physique and the most nervous tempera - ment , is likely to surprise most readers .

		As in the case of many men and women of the noblest achievement , what she has accomplished seems to have been effected in spite of the body rather than with its help .

		XOTES .

		Two plays by
Jean Rotrou	PERSON	, '' Saint
Genest	PERSON	'' and '' Venceslas , '' with an elaborate introduction and notes by Professor
Thonias F. Crane	PERSON	, form a volume for use as a college text now published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The publishers of Miss
Clara Barton	PERSON	's interesting little volume called `` The Story of My Childhood , '' re - viewed in this issue of The Dial , announce that
Miss Barton	PERSON	has in preparation other volumes bearing on her subsequent life .

		Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's latest book , '' The Gentlest Art , '' will be published in this coimtry by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The art alluded to in the title is that of letter writing , and the volume is an anthology of the most entertaining letters in the language .

		The '' Globe Edition '' of the English poets , probably the best known and most widely used of all such edi - tions , is to appear this fall in a new series to be desig - nated as '' The New Globe Poets . ''

		At the same time the works of Bj-ron are to be added to the series , with an introductory biographical sketch by the late Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	. ''

		The Prairie Classics '' is the title of a new series of standard reprints which
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		will inaugurate this
fall	DATE	with four volumes containing
Scott	PERSON	's '' KenUworth '' and '' Ivanhoe '' and
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Tale of Two Cities '' and '' OUver Twist . ''

		The vol - umes will be carefully printed at the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and each is to contain a frontispiece in color .

		Five pocketable volumes of
Thoreau	LOCATION	are sent us by the
Messrs Crowell	PERSON	.

		Each has a frontispiece and a special introduction .

		The '' Excursions '' is headed by
Emerson	PERSON	's biographical sketch , while '' Walden '' is in - troduced by Professor
Roberts	PERSON	, '' A Week on the Con - cord and Merrimac Rivers '' by Mr.
N. H. Dole	PERSON	, and '' Cape Cod '' and '' The
Maine	LOCATION	Woods '' by Mrs.
Annie Russell Marble	PERSON	.

		We learn that Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's '' The Creed of a Lavman , '' which was published last
spring	DATE	, was the first of a series of four volumes which will contain a com - plete collection of his miscellaneous essays .

		The second volimie , containing Philosophical Essays and Discus - sions , will appear in the early fall , and succeeding volumes wUl deal with Social and Economic questions , and
Controversial Essays	ORGANIZATION	and Criticisms .

		A new series of small volumes , each containing a single short story , has been started by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The group of six volumes now issued gives us the following : '' Good-Xight , '' by Miss XUeanor Gates ; '' Allee Same , '' by Miss
Frances Aymar Mat	PERSON	- thews ; `` Dawn , '' by Miss
Katharine Holland Brown	PERSON	; ''
Schmidt	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Lloyd Osboume	PERSON	; '' In the Deep of the Snow , '' by Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	; and '' Ara - miuta and the Automobile , '' by Mr.
Charles Battell Loomis	PERSON	.

		These booklets are prettily illustrated .

		The following additions to the '' World 's Classics '' are annoimced by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	for immediate publication : Butler s '' Analogy , '' edited by Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone ;
Cervantes	PERSON	's `` Don Quixote '' -LRB- Jervas 's translation in two volumes -RRB- , edited by Mr.
J. Fitzmaurice Kelly	PERSON	;
Smollett	PERSON	's '' Travels through
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, '' with introduction by Mr.
T. Seccombe	PERSON	; Fielding 's '' Journal of a Voyage to
Lisbon	LOCATION	, '' with introduction and notes by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	; and the first volume of the copy - right reprints of
Ruskin	PERSON	-LRB-
Ruskin House	ORGANIZATION	editions , by special arrangement with Mr. -LRB- ieorge
Allen	PERSON	-RRB- , consisting of '' Sesame and Lilies '' and '' The Ethics of the Dust . ''

		Three important volumes of historical and descriptive character contained in
Messrs. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's fall list are the following : '' A Handbook of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines , '' by Mr.
Hamilton M. Wright	PERSON	, a manual of the productions , resources , and commercial aspect of tha islands ; `` The Great Plams , 1527-1870 , '' by Mr.
Ran	PERSON	- dall
Parrish	PERSON	, which may he called a topical history of the great movements that opened and settled the vast area between the
Missouri	LOCATION	and the Rockies ; and '' The Campaign of
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	, '' a strategic history of one of the most interesting lessons in modem warfare , by Col.
H. H. Sargent	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, who is a recognized authority on the conduct of military operations .

		In
Portsmouth	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, the early home of the late
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, a movement has taken rise to establish an appropriate and permanent memo - rial .

		A committee of citizens , headed by the mayor of the city , has led in the formation of
The Thomas Bailey Aldrich Memorial Association	ORGANIZATION	, which proposes to acquire by purchase the old house in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	which belonged to ilr .

		Aldrich 's grandfather ,
Thomas Darling Bailey	PERSON	, the house in which Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	spent his boyhood , and to preserve it in perpetuity as a memorial museum .

		Mrs.
Aldrich	PERSON	and Mr.
Talbot Aldrich	PERSON	, the poet 's surviving son , have agreed to deposit there his priceless collection of first editions and valuable manuscripts and auto - graphs , together with many other literaiy relics of the first interest , and have undertaken to restore the interior of the house as nearly as possible to its old-time appear - 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ance .

		It is hoped to raise by popular subscription the sum of
$ 10,000	MONEY	, which will suffice for the pui-chase of the house and will provide a sufficient endowment to insure its proper maintenance .

		Contributions may be sent to the Treasurer of
The Thomas Bailey Aldrich Memorial Association	ORGANIZATION	, care of
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Company	ORGANIZATION	, 4 Park Street ,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		An important publishing enterprise just announced by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is that of a library of selected literature for children , to be entitled '' The Children 's Hour . ''

		Its aim is to bring within the rea - sonable compass of ten volumes of convenient size the best stories for children which can be gathered together .

		The work of selection has been done under the direction of Miss
Eva March Tappan	PERSON	, well known as a writer of stories for children and as an author possessing excep - tional ability for a work of this kind .

		Her selections have been made with the cooperation of other experts under the direction of the publishers .

		The aim has been to construct a set of books for children in which the parents may have a feeling of confidence tliat the liter - ature here provided is that which every child really ought to have .

		Superstition , says Mr.
Fletcher Bascom Dressier	PERSON	, is `` that form of emotional credulity prompted by an emo - tional predisposition which had its origin in adjustments to physical conditions long since passed away . ''

		This definition is taken from a monogi-aph on `` Superstition and Education '' published at the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Dressier	PERSON	has been collecting superstitions from his students to the number of nearly nine hundred , mostly women , in two
California	LOCATION	Normal schools .

		With each superstition furnished , the student expressed either disbelief , partial beUef , or full belief .

		The results are presented statistically in classified form .

		What most impresses us is the astonishing number and variety of the superstitions recorded , many of them hav - ing been contributed by a single student each .

		The show - ings of belief and misbelief are rather melancholy , coming as they do from young people of the average age of nine - teen , engaged in preparation for educational work .

		A publishing aimounceraent of unusual interest is made by
Messrs. Duffield & Company	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	and
Chatto & Windus	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	.

		These two houses have arranged for the publication of a series of books to be called the ''
Shakespeare Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which will be included various volumes indispensable to a thorough understanding of the poet , but never before issued at reasonable prices .

		The Library will be divided into four parts .

		Part fii ` st will include '' The Old Spelling Shakespeare , '' published in forty volumes and in the orthogi'aphy of the poet 's own time , the text under the editorship of Dr.
Fumivall	PERSON	; Part second .

		The Shake - speare Classics , under the general editorship of Professor
I. Gollancz	PERSON	, editor of
The Temple Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, will include the various romances , histories , plays , and poems used by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	as the originals or direct sources of his plays ; Part three , called
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
England	LOCATION	, will include volumes illustrative of the
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	, thought , and literature of
England	LOCATION	in the time of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		A fourth part , to be called the
Lamb Shakespeare for Yoimg People	ORGANIZATION	, will be based on Charles and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	's tales , in which an attempt will be made to msert skilfully within the setting of prose those scenes and passages from the plays with which the young reader should early become acquainted .

		The work will be done imder the special supervision of Professor
Gollancz	PERSON	, the editor of the Library .

		AXXOTJNCEMENT LIST OF FALL BOOKS .

		The classified list given below as the prospective output for the coming fall and winter season contains nearly itOO titles , representing about fifty American publishing houses .

		These announcement lists , carefully prepared from the ear - liest and most authentic sources especially for our pages , have for many years been a special feature of The Dial ; and their usefulness and interest , both to the book trade and the book public , have long been recognized .

		They not only show at a glance what books are coming out in any depart - ment of literature , but make a complete showing of the principal publishing activities of the year .

		All the books entered are new books -- new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and while no attempt has been made to include titles as titles merely , regardless of their significance or interest to our readers , yet it is be - lieved that no really important book is missing from the list .

		Some of the more interesting featiu'es among these announce - ments are commented upon in the leading editorial in this issue of The Dial .

		LIST OF N'EW BOOKS 217 A TEST OF CHARACTER .

		A maxim by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, recently brought to light , reads a.s follows : `` A man shows his ti-ue character only when he speaks of a great man or of a great thing .

		Tl ^ t is the true touch - stone of his soul . '

		* Speaking of touchstones , we are reminded of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's insistence upon the usefulness of pro \ ` iding one 's .

		self with an apparatus of brief poetical passages , supremely excellent in form , to be used as tests of poetry in general .

		No matter how deceptive the spurious metal may be .

		when viewed by itself , its character is plainly revealed when it is brought into comparison with the pure gold of a phrase from
Dante	ORGANIZATION	or Milton or Shake - speare .

		Groethes maxim woxdd seem to extend still further the usefulness of such touchstone phrases .

		Applj - them , not to poetrj - for the purpose of technical criticism , but to men , as tests of their capacity for generous appreciation and lofty imaginings .

		It is not the least among the uses of noble literature that it may thus serve to distinguish the aristocracy of intellec - tual endowment from the common herd of those whose thought Is untinged by idealism , and whose mental horizon is closely circumscribed by the narrow things of the household and the market-place .

		Particularly in a society based upon a high average of material comfort , in which all sorts of men wear the same kinds of clothes , read the same newspapers , and do the same things , some test of a searching nature is needed to enable us to discern those funtlamental differences lietween man and man which must still exist , however disguisetl by conventional habit and wonted course of life .

		We were reading not long ago what seemed to be an intelligent article upon the conditions of successful authorship .

		AVe followed the writer 's argument with respect until an unfor - tunate illustration revealed his true character .

		He referred to the traditional ten jwunds re - ceived by 2kIilton for • • Paradise Lost , '' and remarked that it was probably more than that '' flatulent epic '' was worth .

		This amaring revelation of intellectual indigence made it clear that the wTiter was not likely to have anything worth saying upon any subject related to litera - ture .

		The entire influence of what hatl gone before wa.s instantly destroyed .

		To the same 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, effect we may offer another example that lias lingered in the memory for several years .

		The case is that of a yoimg man who wrote poetry , and was by way of achieving a certain modest success in his pursuit of the art .

		He liad seemed to give evidence both of poetical sensi - bility and of expressive faculty .

		But one un - lucky day he expressed himself -LRB- in newspaper prose -RRB- upon the subject of one of the gi-eatest of poets , and this is what he said : '' As for his being a great poet , I do n't see it .

		A lot of stuffy old professors and semi-hysterical school - marms pretend to find a lot in
Dante	LOCATION	's stuff , but they are suffering from intellectual dry-rot . ''

		The pitiable vulgarity of disposition evidenced by this screed put an end to any hopes we had entertained concerning that particular writer of verse .

		It set him definitely outside the pale of the Muses ' Kingdom .

		In the light of such an illustration of meanness of soul we realize the stern significance of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's maxim .

		It becomes more than a sentence in the ordinary meaning of the word , it becomes a sentence of judgment , fixed and unappealable .

		The foregoing examples of character tested and foimd wanting are of inconspicuous proven - ance ^ but others are not lacking which involve well-known names .

		Without drawing upon the countless instances in which gi-eat spirits of the same age have failed to do each other justice , we may find a sufficiency of striking manifesta - tions of defective sympathy among the jtidg - ments pronoimced by famous men of letters upon their more famous predecessors .

		The blindness which marked
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's estimate of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Johnson	PERSON	's estimate of
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's estimate of
Shelley	LOCATION	, went beyond the limits of what may be condoned as personal idiosyncrasy ; they were something more than a legitimate difference in the stand - ards of taste ; they provided a revelation of character that seriously impairs our respect for the men who were capable , with all deliberation , of such perverse utterances .

		And the warmest admirers of the great Russian moralist of our own time must admit that their idol is partly composed of clay when they read the labored argument in which he imagines he has disproved the genius of Shakespeare .

		One feels that so fatal a defect in a man 's make-up as that argu - ment reveals must make his opinions upon any subject open to suspicion , must immeasurably lessen his influence as a teacher of ethics or anything else .

		Another modem instance in illustration of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's maxim may be found in the critical antics of the intellectual mountebank who seems to be taken seriously in some quarters as a prophet of advanced thought , and even as a trustworthy guide for the conduct of life , and who has delivered himself upon the subject of Shakespeare to the following effect : '' There are moments when one asks despairingly why our stage should ever have been cursed with this ' immortal ' pilferer of other men 's stories and ideas , with his monstrous rhetbrical fustian , his unbearable platitudes , his pretentious reduction of the subtlest i > roblems of life to commonplaces against which a Polytechnic debating club would revolt . ''

		It woiUd not be ea.sy to match this example of a pygmy soul taking pride in its own insignificance .

		It was
Emerson	PERSON	, we believe , who once said that it always gave him pleasure to meet men who realized the superiority of Shake - speare over all other wi'iters .

		What he would have felt coidd he have met Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is not difficult to conjecture , and we can hardly imagine even
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's imjierturbable serenity as remaining quite unruffled in the presence of so monstrous an exhibition of fatuous ignorance .

		The world 's judgment upon such men as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and Shakspeare and
Milton	PERSON	has been , of coiu-se , so definitely pronoimcetl that no man may now hope to reverse it .

		If one can not honestly share it , he should take Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's advice , and pray for a cleaner spirit , instead of indulging in clamorous dissent from the house - tops .

		He need not assei-t wliat he does not believe , for that would be hj ` pocrisy , but his attitude should be one of becoming humility , of regretful admission that the fault must be his , and tliat the world is svirely right .

		There is hope for the one who takes this position , and the light may dawn upon him when he least expects it .

		He may in time come to
Guinevere	LOCATION	's point of view : '' It was my duty to have loved the highest : It surely was my profit had I known ; It would have been my pleasure had I seen . ''

		And if it be not altogether true that '' We needs must love the highest when we see it , '' it is better to aspire toward tliat condition of enlightenment than to entrench the soul in purblind self-sufficiency , and snarl at whatever exceeds the scope of its vision .

		We have illustrated our maxim-text by examjjles taken solely from the field of litera - ture .

		But
Goethe	PERSON	meant it to be far wider in its application , and the theme might profitably be enlarged upon with reference to the other arts , and to the stiU broader field of hiunan life .

		The annals of history , no less than the achieve -
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		195 ments of art , provide these touchstones of the soul , and a man 's character may be teste < l no less clearly by observing how his mind thiiUs to significant deeds than by noting its response to the appeal of significant forms of expression .

		Shakespeare nearly anticipated
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's thought when he wrote that '' Spirits are not finely touched But to fine issues , '' for he also meant that a man 's character is best revealetl by the way in which it reacts to the stimulus of worthy deeds and noble thoughts , as these are found in the artistic inheritance of the race and in the historical recoixl of its upward growth .

		THE SHORT STORY OF TO-DAY .

		A STATISTICAL STUDY .

		In the following article , I shall not attempt to l -RRB- rove that the modern short story had its inception in
America	LOCATION	, or that it is a distinct type of literature : neither shall I ti-ace the history of the short story from
Boccaccio	LOCATION	to
Kipling	LOCATION	, nor attempt to explain its art when practised by such masters as Mdrim ^ e ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Turgenieff	LOCATION	, Maupassant .

		Instead , I shall con - tent myself with gi \ ` ing the results of a systematic study of the short stories published in the leading American magazines during the closing months of
1906	DATE	.

		In beginning my study , I read carefully all the short stories * published last year in the
Septem	LOCATION	- ber ,
October , November	DATE	, and
December	DATE	numbers of the following magazines : American ... 25 stories
Lippincott	PERSON	's ... 25 stories
Appleton	PERSON	's ... 24 stories
McClure	PERSON	's ... 24 stories
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	.

		12 stories Metropolitan ... 31 stories Century Magazine 21 stories
Munsey	PERSON	's 23 stories Cosmopolitan .

		.

		22 stories
Pearson	PERSON	's 27 stories Everybo < ly ' 8 ... 26 stories Reader 14 stories
Harper	PERSON	's ... 27 stories
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's ... 18 stories Three hundred and nineteen stories were read , ranging in length from 800 to 15,000 words ; twenty-six stories fall below 2500 words ; twenty - four exceed 7600 words .

		Of the authors , 157 are men , 76 women .

		As the men write 213 stories , it is obvious that a third of the short fiction pub - lished in these magazines is the work of women .

		It may not be amiss , in speaking of the sex of the writers , to mention that in sixty-three stories women have no part and that there are only four purely feminine stories in the lot While it may not be impossible to write a short story with no masculine character , which shall interest the average reader , it is a significant fact that such an one is not among the stories under consideration .

		Ninety-eight authors fail to give the location of their stories , which are here classified a-s '' location • I have followed the classification of '' ' What 's in the
Maga	PERSON	- zines . ' ''

		All stories classified under '' Fiction . ''

		which are com - plete in one number of the maeazine , exceptine novelettes , the storiettes in
Mimsey	LOCATION	's .

		and fables , are here treated as short stories .

		doubtful . ''

		Of this class , however , with perhaps a half-dozen exceptions wliich describe some phase of the life in the
Middle West	LOCATION	the atmosphere is
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	.

		The authoi-s of forty-two stories state definitely that their cliaracters are
New Yorkers	LOCATION	; and it seems more than probable that the people in thirty-three of the stories whose location is doubtful are residents of the metrojx -RRB- lis , while as many more of the '' doubtful '' stories have an atmosphere that the reader naturally associates with
New York	LOCATION	and its neighboring towns and villages .

		Next to
New York	LOCATION	in pouit of number is
New England	LOCATION	, witli nineteen stories ; while the characters in twenty of the '' doubtful '' stories are unquestionably Yankees .

		Fotu ' stories ai'e found in and around the coal mines of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and the Dutch of the same state are the people in three more .

		South of
Mason	ORGANIZATION	and
Dixon	PERSON	's Line are found nine stories , in three of which the negro plays a part The authors of fourteen stories describe the life of the inhabitants of the mountainous region west of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		Eight , two or three of them long-drawn wails of loneliness , come from the desert haunts of the cactus , the tarantula , and tlie horned-toad .

		Three authoi-s locate their stories in
Chicago	LOCATION	; two others in neigh - boring towns .

		Kansas contributes two stories ,
Missouri	LOCATION	one , the mines of northern
Michigan	LOCATION	another .

		The Great Lakes give up a love romance .

		The woodsmen and trappers and Indians of the wilds of
Canada	LOCATION	are depicted in nine stories .


Alaska	LOCATION	and
Newfoundland	LOCATION	each contribute a tragedy .

		Seven stories come from the sea ; ten others have each a scene on board ships .

		Eighty-six , or a little more tlian a fourth of all the stories , are founded in foreign countries .

		If those from
Canada	LOCATION	,
Alaska	LOCATION	,
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, and the sea are added , it is seen at once that a third -- 104 , to be exact -- are found outside the boundaries of our own country .

		Granting that a few of them were \ vi-itten by foreign authors , the result can scarcely be regarded as a triumph for those critics who have been trying to teach American authors to write American stories .

		To
England	LOCATION	belong twenty-five of the foreign stories , eleven of which are in
London	LOCATION	.

		France gets an even score ; a dozen of these French contes are worked out in the Latin Quai-ter or on the boule - vards of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The mainland of
Spain	LOCATION	is the scene of fom - stories ; tlu-ee are laid in Spanish islands in the
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	.

		Five come from the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

Turkey	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	get three each .


Italy	LOCATION	and fictitious republics in
Central America	LOCATION	have two representatives each .

Eastern Asia	ORGANIZATION	, the cattle ranges of
Australia	LOCATION	, the mountains of
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, and the
Bermuda Islands	LOCATION	, liave each a single representative in this collection : while the remaining seven stories ai-e scattered over real and fictitious countries .

		The fact that practically every story contains more than one element of interest would seem , on 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, tii-st thought , to make any attempt at classification futile ; however , after a careful study of these 319 stories , I have been able to classify most of them .

		The love-story , the story of adventure , the humorous story , the sociological and the psychological study , the industrial , political , and detective stories , the character study , the newspaper baseball and foot - ball stories , the study in horror , the story of married life , Chi'istmas , Indian , and ghost stories , suggest themselves without reflection .

		However , these are only a few of the more important types .

		As the love-stories are not only most numerous but also most interesting as a study , producing some rather curious facts , I shall give the statistics in detail .

		Of course , not all stories in which there is a love interest , or which end in marriage , are classi - fied as love-stories ; only those in which the predomi - nating interest is in winning a heart , or retaining a heart already won , are placed under this head .

		There are sixty-seven stories of this type , of which twenty-nine have foreign backgrounds .

		In twenty - five stories , the authors leave the impression that their leading characters are soon to marry ; seven - teen end in marriage ; in fifteen , engagements are announced ; the wrong man proposes in one ; in another , the end is a little too subtle for me to tell whether the man gets the girl or not .

		It is rather interesting to note that ten of the seventeen mar - riages take place in foreign countries .

		If nothing else can be said in praise of the American as a lover , it must be admitted that , since but seven of the forty-nine love romances worked out in the
United States	LOCATION	actually end in marriage , he is an extremely cautious fellow .

		While he does not hesitate to lead the girl to believe that he intends to marry her , and shows no very great aversion to becoming engaged , he is certainly in no undue haste to involve himself in hymeneal bonds .

		Eight of the love-stories end tragically .

		A Spanish seilorita , a Pueblo Indian girl , and a French daughter of northern
Canada	LOCATION	murder their lovers .

		An in - sane Frenchman poisons his son 's fiancie .

		After sparing the life of his rival , a Japanese lover com - mits hari-kari on the battlefield .

		A French gii-l dies of a broken heart soon after her lover has sold , for a hundred francs , his right to her love .

		An P > nglish chorus-girl pines away and dies when she realizes that her lover 's social position will prevent their mar - riage .

		A jilted Spanish youth is not disapjxjinted when he elects , as a sure means of death , the life of a soldier ; for he is destined te become one of the eighty thousand sons whom
Spain	LOCATION	sacrificed in her futile effort to retain her sovereignty over
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these trag - edies of love is that in only one does an American play a part , and even here he does not strike the blow .

		It would seem from these love-stories that neither the American man nor woman loves to the point of tragedy , -- our daily newspapers to the contrary not - withstanding .

		There is another peculiarity about the American lovers among these story - people .

		Although the sincerest love is based upon self-sacrifice , the note of self-sacrifice is seldom touched by an American -- again the newspapers to the contrary .

		Duplicity is another -LRB- juality made conspicuous by its absence .

		From the foregoing , three important facts are de - duced : first , when an author intends that hLs hero and heroine shall actually marry he either selects for - eign characters or drags Americans into some foreign country ; second , when he has a tragic conclusion in mind he invariably selects not only foreign char - acters but also a foreign background ; third , the American is a selfish but not a deceitful lover .

		Humor , or an attempt at humor , is the predomi - nating note in forty-seven of the 319 stories .

		In forty stories the delineation of the central figure 's characteristics seems to be the chief end in view .

		The child-story has twenty-eight representatives , six of which are classified as humorous .

		In fifteen of these stories , gii-ls have the leading roles ; while eleven fall to boys .

		In two stories the parts are of about equal importance .

		The writers of twenty - three stories wrestle with some type of psychological pi'oblem , making but little attempt to conceal the bald fact .

		Of course , other writers are more or less interested in problems , but they weave them so skil - fully into the woof of their stories that they constitute only one of the elements of interest .

		Such stories are given diverse classifications .

		Twenty-one deal with one phase or another of married life , problems and humor predominating ; however , eight of them seem best called simply stories of married life .

		Adventure is the predominating note in eighteen stories .

		There are but seven Christmas stories in the fourteen magazines .

		The Western , the detective , and the industrial stories have an even half - < lozen representatives each .

		The political field gets five stories .

		The Civil War has not been forgotten , as is attested by four authors who found their material in that gi-eat conflict .

		Four others made purely sociological studies , and the same number wrote fantastic tales .

		Of the seventeen stories which have one or more scenes on board ships , but three of them strike me as stories of the sea .

		To the police , to the brigand , to the newspaper , and to mystery solved and unsolved , are devoted thi'ee stories each .

		While the Indian appears in six stories , there are but two instances in which the chief interest centres in the red man and his life .

		The railroads , ghosts , the new woman , anarchy , and football -- note the com - bination -- have two representatives each .

		There are two burlesques on French manners .

		Two stories illustrate the irony of fate ; two more are fairy stories .

		Among the animals that have parts in these stories are found two dogs , an elephant , a pig , a collection of pets , and a horse as raconteur .

		The automobile is used in only three stories .

		Only seven old maids with leading parts are found among the several hundred characters .

		Writers on the race question and the labor question are silent ; the golf storj ' , the temperance story , and the story dealing with divorce , are also types that are missing .

		THE DIAL .

		197 Judging from these stories , the old bachelor , as a distinct species , is almost extinct .

		In one story out of five -- sixty-six , to be exact -- one or more of tlie cliai-acters uses a dialect .

		In eleven stories a Western dialect is spoken ; in nine ; the Irishman 's brogue amuses .

		In seven stories the ratal New Englander sj -RRB- eaks his Yankee vernaculai '' ; in a half-dozen more , the Frenchman talks English with a Parisian accent .

		The Hebrew is heard in five stories , the Dutch in four , and the Slav in the same number .

		Italians , Englishmen , sailors , and negroes enunciate in three stories each in their own peculiar w ^ ay .

		In two stories each the German and the mountaineer distort our language .

		The remain - ing four excursions in dialect are hard to classify .

		A note of humor brings to an end forty-three stories .

		The authors of thirty-seven stories leave the impression that their leading cliaracters ai-e soon to marry ; thirty-six stories conclude with manuage ; in twenty-four , engagements are announced .

		Death brings thirty-five stories to their end ; in ten of these stories one of tlie leading charactei-s is murderetl .

		Twenty stories condude with the halo of success resting on the hero 's head ; in fourteen more , rec - onciliation is brought about ; in an even dozen cases , one of the characters accepts the inevitable and the story ends in resignation .

		Mystery is solved in eight stories ; in seven the yoke of tyranny is shaken oft ' , in as many more someone 's eyes are opened ; a half-dozen contests end with unconditional suiTcn - der ; in a like number of cases some peril is averted ; in as many more , perfect contentment reigns .

		Five characters repent ; the same number are victorious .

		In foui - stories , separated charactei-s are united ; a like number end with a relapse ; a friendly act con - cludes three ; insanity has a single victim ; the remaining thirty-seven have a vaiiety of conclusions wliich fall outside the foregoing classification .

		With no claim to any title other than that of a reader of average intelligence .

		I offer a few obser - vations and conclusions for what they may be worth .

		That the psychological story is , when well done , perhaps the most subtle of all stories , few will deny .

		But imless the characters are drawn so carefully , so time to life , that the end seems inevitable , for me at least , the story has no value .

		StUl , the writers of thLs type of story often seem wilfully to neglect character delineation .

		If , as is so often done by the writers of the psycliological stories under consider - ation , the reader is given mere lay fig ^ es , it is hard to understand how the author can expect him to accept the solution .

		Merely to say what man will do under given circumstances seems a waste of time ; for are the solutions not innumerable ?

		That the element of surprise , although it is the saving grace of many types of stories , has no place in the conclusion of a psychological study , appears self - evident ; yet it is by no means unusual .

		Too often these wTiters , -- through lack of ability to perform the really difficult feat of creating a character , or because , having the ability , they are unwilling to take the time , -- forget that it is perfectly legitimate to pose a question in the short story without attempt - ing to answer it .

		Simjjly because , with a few deft strokes , the masters of this type of story have been able to create living chai-acters , and then liave lost little time in beginning their psychological analysis , it does not follow that anyone who elects to write a psychological story has the same ability .

		For one not a genius to attempt to create a character with - out the use of action is to attempt an Icarian task .

		That the reader does not get his clearest insight into a character while the writer is telling about him , but when he is seen in action , is a truth which must have been recognized long before the first story was written .

		To say that action is not only the medium which introduces a reader to the true nature of a character in fiction or of a friend in life , but that it is also the medium tliat introduces a reader to liimself , is merely to repeat a truism .

		Still , despite these well-recognized facts , action , generally speak - ing , is the psychological writer 's special aversion .

		The interest in the animal story , which ran ram - pant a few years ago , proved the passing whim of a changeful public .

		Notwithstanding the fact that a few of the best fiction writers in
America	LOCATION	to-day are giving their time to the child-story , it is hard to believe that it is anything more than the popular caprice of the hour , and one naturally wonders if it is not destined to meet a fate similar to that of the animal story .

		A lack of knowledge of child-life can be brought against many of the writers of the child - story .

		The country girl of ten , who supposed a mole to be swifter than a dog , and thought that , when pursued , a mole would seek shelter in a corn - house , is scarcely an exceptional child in the stories under consideration .

		As important as is masterly character delineation to the interest of the psychologfical study , is humor to the chUd-storj ' .

		But instead of humor , most of the writers of this type of story are endowed with a proud father 's loquacity .

		It is possible to listen for a few minutes , with a pretence at patience , even to the proudest parent 's harangue ; likewise , it is possible to read , with patience if not with pleasure , say a 3000-word story about a child .

		But when an author , with the persistent loquacity of the proud father , insists on pouring out a 10,000-word child - story , practically without the essential element of humor , it seems time to protest .

		A fourth of the child-stories exceed 6500 words -- much above the average lengfth of the stories under consideration .

		The number of these stories that turn on events imaginatively impossible is really surprising .

		Grant - ing that many unquestionably classic stories have this fault , and that more than one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays turn on incidents that the modern imagination rejects , while some critics are willing to overlook this fault , it would seem that in this materialistic age writers less gifted than the
Bard of	ORGANIZATION	-
Avon	PERSON	might consent to base their stories on events that an average reader could accept as possible .

		Fully a fourth of these stories could be condemned on this count .

		If the reader puts no check on his pessimism and 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, looks deep into the hearts of these American story - people , he might justly accuse them of many grave faults .

		Still , despite the fact that some of them are averse to self-sacrifice , -- that when they do surren - der it is too frequently a painful process , creating the impression that the sacrifice does not come from the heart and tliat a rebellion may be expected , -- that tliere are few all-around lovable characters among them , -- that their kindness is too often brutal in its frankness , -- that they have a deejj - seated aversion to showing their passions or to dying merely to anmse the reader , -- one would search in vain for a really despicable cliaracter among the American story-people found in the 819 stories read .

		More than this -- there is not one among them without some admirable quality .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		9 The
Glasgow	LOCATION	convention of librarians two weeks ago was in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the
Libi'ary Association of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	, an orgiiuizatiou only one year yoimger than the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, the pioneer in the move - ment of incorporating and l -RRB- ringiiig into mutually helpful relations the widespread library interests of a whole nation .

		Among the papers read and discussed at
Glasgow	LOCATION	-- some of whicli we shall perhaps take occa - sion later to refer to nion ^ particularly -- were disser - tations on '' The Librarian and his Relation with Books , '' `` The Net Books Question , '' `` Library legislation , '' '' New Proposals in Regard to Public Libraries by the
National Home Reading Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' and , in matters of minute practical detail , '' Catalogue Rules , '' and ' • Sound Leather . ''

		Other papers there were , in sufficient abtm - dance , of local rather than general interest , such as , '' The Organization of the
Glasgow	LOCATION	District Libraries , '' `` English and Scottish Royal Heraldry , '' and `` The Liability of Public Libraries to be Assessed for Rates and Taxes . ''

		Comiuentuig editorially ou the history and influence of tlie
Association	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	, editor of `` The Library , '' well says : '' It is certainlj ' an extraor - dinary witness to the enthusiasm of librarians for their work that the history of the association may lie searched for a whole generation and hardly a trace will be found in it of the urging of any personal pecuniary claims .

		Librarians are loud in demanding more money for tlieir libraries , but althougii in proportion to their work they are probably the worst paid body of men and women in the
United Kingtloni	LOCATION	, the questions of salaries and pension schemes witli which associations of scliool - mastei 's and schoobnisti-esses are not infrequently con - cerned , have hardly ever figured on tlie agenda pajjer at eitlier the annual or monthly meeting of the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The same praise is due to our own high - minded and devoted librarians -- thougli , as salaries go , they fai-e better than their fellows of other lands .

		The short detective story , interest in which just now seems to be showing renewed freshness , owes what - ever excellence it jwssesses to the ingenuity , and also the j -RRB- lausibility , of its plot .

		There is commonly little character-study in it , little appeal to the emotions other than curiosity , little display of tlie finer qualities of style .

		Hence the plot , the mechanism , wliich is nearly ever \ ' - tliing , shoidd be all but faultless ; the machinery should not creak or break down ; the gearing should be nicely adjusted to the motive power and tfj the work to be performed .

		Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's little adventure into this attractive field of fiction in the
September	DATE	'' Century '' is pervaded mth a good deal of the charm of the writer 's personality .

		His membership on the board of directors of the Library Company of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , and his omnivorous passion for books , make him perfectly at home in matters of library administra - tion and the jxjcuUarities of book-worms ; while his pi'ofessioual experience enables him to write convinc - ingly of doctors and diseases -- all of which enter into '' The Mind Reader . ''

		But in his bui ` glary he is much less of an adept , probablj - from lack of practice with the jimmy and other tools of the trade .

		His whole story , which by the way is much longer than the strictly detective part requires -- but we quarrel not with the padding -- breaks down when the two burglars are seized with terror at the death of the man whose will they have stolen , and whose mortal mjury they have accidentally caused in effecting their theft .

		The will , however , could have no value for them except in the event of the testator 's decease ; for he could at any time b `` !

		fore his death make a new will , thus reducing the earlier one to the value of waste paper .

		But appar - ently , and strangely enough , the burglars had planned to abstract the will without injuring its maker , and then to extort a liandsome payment for the restoration .

		One knows not which most to marvel at , the stupidity of the burglars -- who , it should be added , left imtouched a solid silver table service as l > eing insignificant in value compared with the will -- or the somnolence of the author -LRB- and of the editor -RRB- in permitting so obvious a blunder to pass uncorrected .

		The creator ok `` D. \ rics Green '' Ls quietly and contentedly romiding out his four-score years at Arling - ton in these pleasant autumn days -- symbolic of the pleasant autunm of Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	's busy and useful life .

		The occasion brings to mind the curious story of
Darius Green	PERSON	of
Washington	LOCATION	, as thus related by the
Washington	LOCATION	correspondent of a northern paper : '' In one of my trips througli the
Xavy Department	ORGANIZATION	I was introduced to the chief clerk of the
Bureau of Con	ORGANIZATION	- struction , whose name is Darius -LRB- ireen . '

		Not the
Darius Green	PERSON	of flying-machine fame ? '

		I asked upon hearing his name . '

		Exactly , ' he replied smiling ; ` that is just who I am . '

		He then told me his story . '

		Some thirty-five years ago , ' lie said , ' 1 was a boy attending a school at
Medford	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		One day the poet
Trow	PERSON	- bridge called ujion the principal , a personal friend , and sketched out the plan of Iiis celebrated story of the tiying-inacliine .

		`` I have , ' he said , `` everything how except a name for nij - hero .

		Can ' t you find among your scholars one that will suit ? ''

		My teacher thought over the names of his pupils and mentioned mine to Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	, who accepted it and made me famous . '


Darius Green	PERSON	was employed in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	yard of
Boston	LOCATION	-LSB-
Charlestown	LOCATION	-RSB- for a number of years .

		In
1889	DATE	he came to
Washington	LOCATION	and accepted his present position in the
Bureau of Construction	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The most curious part of the whole storj ' is that Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	denies all knowledge of this
Medford-Cliarlestown-Washington Darius Green	PERSON	, who has certainly demonstrated that he has a genius for construction .

		The poet declares he has
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 never been inside a
Medford	LOCATION	schoolroom and has never enjoyed the acquaintance of a
Medford	LOCATION	schoohnaster .

		But the story is one of those that ought to be true , and perhaps its inventor believes himself to be discharging a moral obligation in upholding its truth .

		• `` • Mb .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's drastic method of dkauxg wtth POVERTY , as advocated in the preface to ''
John Bull	PERSON	's
Other Island	LOCATION	, '' appears to be regarded not without favor in his own country .

		Newspaper discussion has been gravely carried on as to the undesirability of lessening the infant mortality of
London	LOCATION	's sliuus .

		What imme - diately raised the question was an utterance from Dr.
W. MacDougall	PERSON	, the psychologist , in the
1906	DATE	issue of • * Sociological Papers '' just put forth by the
Sociological Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Speaking of the abolition of infant mortality .

		Dr.
MacDougall	PERSON	says : `` This is likely to be completely effected in the
next two years	DATE	, and we shall then have abolished the one factor which in any important degree at present tends to redress the balance between the rates of reproduction of the superior and inferior classes . ''

		Professor
Flinders Petrie	PERSON	aJso , in his ''
Janus	ORGANIZATION	in Modem Life , '' deprecates this humanitarian effort to rescue the poor babies and add them to the toiling millions of men and women . '

		• It would be . ''

		he declares , '' from the lowest type of careless , thriftless , dirty and incapable families that the increase would be obtained . '' ''

		Is it worth while , '' he asks , • • to dilute our increase of popu - lation by ten per cent more of the most inferior kind ?

		Will England be stronger for having one-thirtieth more , and that of the worst stock , added to the population every year ? ''

		To this Dr.
C. W. Saleeby	PERSON	replies that it is untrue to speak of infant mortality as a '' natural weeding-out of the unfit '' ; that the victims are bom capable of rendering a good account of themselves if only given a fair chance ; and that West-End children , if exposed to the same perik and hardships , would fare no better .

		Yes , the time has passed when it was hon - estly believed that one war in a generation was beneficial and even necessary as a natural blood-letting to the plethoric body of the nation .

		• • • LiTKRART TAP FOR INFANT MINDS is increasing greatly in quantity .

		Taking pattern after -- and some - times a long way after -- the admirable '' Tales from Shakespeare , '' volume after volume has appeared of stories from Homer and
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, from Chaucer and Froissart , from the travels of
Lemuel Gulliver	PERSON	and the adventures of the ingenious Knight of La Mancha , with innumerable other juvenile editions and adaptations of famous classics .

		Is there wisdom in this anticipatory action of kind-hearted literary ladies and gentlemen of unoriginal or uncreative bent ?

		It is something like feeding the child with plums out of the pudding , or with frosting from the cake , or like gi \ ` ing him a peep at his presents before
Christmas	DATE	has come .

		There is danger of disenchantment in this .

		Children have a plenty of books written originally for them ; why then deprive them of the pleasure and exliilaration of discov - ering all these masterpieces for themselves ?

		Adapta - tions and abridgments may even engender disgust for the complete work and prevent its ever being opened .

		The writer remembers , or has been told by his mother , tiiat as a small child he resented any attempt to tell hun the Bible stories in any but the
Bible	LOCATION	language .

		Aud so it well may be and doubtless often is the case that benevolent endeavors to bring an old author down to the boy 's or girl 's comprehension merely result in robbing the author of his peculiar charm and causing him thereafter to be neglected .

		These considerations are suggested by the current issue of a series of juvenile adaptations and simplifications ; and though we may be in the wrong , the question is worthy at least of a pas.sing thought , perhaps even of serious discussion .

		• • • The discovery of another English author is to be credited to us .

		Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	, whose remarkable novel , '' The Helpmate , '' has been holding the wonder - ing attention of so many readers of `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' appears to be somewhat neglected in her own oonntry .

		Over there , as we are uiformed , they find her last book '' dull , '' perhaps because it is so commendably free from all ambitious attempt to picture the smart set , and depends for its interest on a realistic present - iflent of middle-class tvpes .

		Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	ORGANIZATION	gives us the welcome information that
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	-LRB- that is her real name -RRB- is so genuinely modest and imassuming that she will never do anything to get her picture into the papers , nor will she ever force herself on public attention otherwise than by the excellence of her literary work .

		Though she discusses marital prob - lems with the seeming experience of a much-married person , she is still single .

		Perhaps , indeed , the latter fact partly explains the former .

		Her undaunted way of handling a serious and delicate situation in '' The Helpmate '' makes one suspect her of failing to realize the full gravity of the case .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	, who some - what patronizingly commends his countrywoman 's work as '' promising and encouraging . ''

		tells us that she is '' little , precise , quiet , young , restrained , and observant , '' and that '' after you had talked to her for an hour you would say she was ' nice , ' but you would know nothing about what she thought .

		She would probably know a good deal about you . ''

		... A doleful view of modern humor is that taken by the editor of ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's Magazine '' in some vio - lently reactionary reflections on the late-belauded
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		The humor of to-day , the writer points out , is based on the obviously incongruous ; and it goes to un - warrantable lengths in its flippancy and impertinence , holding nothing sacred and respecting no traditions .

		Three Englishmen -- with shame be it confessed -- - are the originators of this disrespectful style of funniness ; and their names are
Tom Brown	PERSON	,
Ned Ward	PERSON	, and
Charles Cotton	ORGANIZATION	.

		But our honored Mark has bettered the orig - inal , so that he is now accused of being a perfect monster of coarseness , '' a bull in the china-shop of ideas . ''

		And , further , '' he attempts to destroy what he could never biuld up , and assumes that his experiment is merito - rious . ''

		Of the ''
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	at
King Arthur	ORGANIZATION	's Court '' the same angry pen saj 's that it is '' such a masterpiece of vulgarity as the world has never seen '' ; and our old friends -- or young friends , rather • --
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	and
Huck Finn	PERSON	are '' two boys who will survive to cast shame on all the humour of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Not that their creator is without gifts ; on the contrary , `` it is for the sake of a genuine talent that we deplore
Mark Twain	PERSON	's studied antics . ''

		What can be said in reply , to calm the dear old
Maga	PERSON	's ruffled temper ?

		Exaggeration and occasioual bad taste must be admitted in our champion humorist .

		But who can read his later writings , the published chapters of his autobiography , the utterances of his serious and tender moods , and hold him guilty of all that is charged in the indictment ?

		200 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Thk	ORGANIZATION	PIPK-DREAM8 OF INVKNT0R8 , if gathered into a `` volume , would make most aimising reading .

		It was not long ago tliat a prospectus was issued by a brilliant genius who solicited the attention of would-be investoi-s to his grand scheme for di'awing on tlie Oliniitable stores of electricity waiting only to be tapped in the blue vault of heaven .

		Drawn earthward , this electric energy would do all the work of the world , while man sat at ease and twirled his thumbs .

		The only thuig required was to make connection with the reservoii ' by means of a copper wire .

		To do this it was proposed to discharge a mam - moth cannon heavenward from the top of Pike 's Peak , the projectile to carry the end of the wire and to be hurled with such force toward the zenith that it would pass beyond the reach of gravitation and remain forever poised in space .

		But all this was to cost money at the outset .

		Now , however , we have a scheme for develoj -RRB- - ing energy that is to cost but a mere trifle from the very start .


Signor RafHe Bova	PERSON	, an Italian electrician , has come all the way from
Carinola	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, to demonstrate before American experts the surpassing merits of his invention `` for rumiiug the largest dynamos without steam or other energy . ''

		All that is recjuired for this is a small battery , no larger than that attached to an electi'ic door-bell , and a transforming apparatus . ''

		In building a fire , '' says our plausible inventor , '' one must have a match .

		I have diseovei'ed the match of elec - tricity , and with it can start the lire that continues to burn .

		In other word.s , with a substance to be obtained anywhere for a
few cents	MONEY	, I originate the force that sets the dynamo in motion and continues it in action . ''

		There is miaccountable mention of a considerable sum of money requii-ed to install the new system ; but this '' installation expense '' may be another name for the inventor 's fee .

		The sum and substance of it all probably is that another dreamer , of the pei-petual-motion oi ` der , has allowed liis imagination to run riot in schemes for getting something at
Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	's bargain-counter below cost .

		* * * A BLDO -RRB- poet 's plaint is uttered in appealingly pathetic accents in Mr.
Morris Rosenfeld	PERSON	's denial of the report of his own death . ''

		I am forced , '' writes the bard of the Ghetto and of the proletariat , '' to declai-e that I am still alive , although death would be far preferable to my present condition .

		... I live ui eternal darkness , for I am blind .

		The light of day has left me , and only misery remains .

		The bourgeoisie , in their splendid palaces , pretended to have heard nothing of the songs of the proletariat , and only my brethren , whom the echo of my muse had reached , sought me in order to assist their blind bard . ''

		He tells the sad story of his illness and poverty , the sufferings of his wife and childi'en , his falling into the usurer 's clutches , and -LRB- as he believes -RRB- the malicious publication of the report of his death in order that liis few patrons might withdraw their help . ''

		The publishers of my poems , '' he continues , `` have had them translated into all lan - guages without paying me a farthing .

		Now that they have heai 'd the news of my death they .

		send wreaths to be placed on the gi-ave of the blind singer , in owler that they , the wealthy , may be able to say that they have paid the tribute of their admiration .

		But henceforth I and my children will thank only those who sacrificed their last crust of bread to help us . ''

		Although there is something a little strained , a little hysterical , in the letter , it reveals a condition of undoubted mental and physical distress , and one that Mr.
Rosenfeld	PERSON	's fellow Hebrews must feel urgently called upon to relieve .

		Everywhere hmuor de - pends on nothing , and that nothing is local .

		Usually those who make a business of trans - lating have verj ' little idea of these delicate shadings : consequently I have never seen an endurable translation . ''

		Garricks reply to this illustrates incidentaUy his fondness for flattery and his ovra liabit of flattering in return .

		He wTites .

		in jiart : '' \ ou have really given so true and ingenious Acwoimt of national taste with regard to the Drama , that it would make a. great fignre in y `` very best Collection of letters that Ever were written -- Your letter , up on my Soul , has charm 'd Me ; & tho I am in the

		It is of Great Consequence to me to Conceal tlie Author of y * Guardian , but it is of ye Utmost to Me not to be foimd Wanting in ye least Article of my Duty to his Royal Highness . ''

		This and the letter immediately following it , to the same person , show the somewhat ticklish relations , as the editor points out , '' of a mana ^ ger of one of the two patent theatres to the Court .

		Though neither company , in the middle of the eighteenth century , was still called ' His Majesty 's Servants , '
Garrick	PERSON	's words prove that he felt his own comings and goings were under surveillance , and thought it was wise to ask for a consent , at least formally necessary , before leaving the stage during the season . '' '

		The opening -LRB- to quote no more -RRB- of the second letter to
Holderness	ORGANIZATION	is instructive . ''

		I have been so much indulg 'd by your Goodness , that I shall venture to open my Griefs to Y '' our Lord - ship -- It is my greatest Ambition that the Company of Drury-Ijane should not appear unworthy of his Royal Highness 's Conunands -- but indeed I am affraid , from a late Rehearsal , that the Comedy of Every Man in his humor will disgrace Us , If I have not a little more time for instruction -- the Language and Characters of

		The lettei 's as a whole tend to corroborate the evidence of
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's clever lines in '' Retaliation , '' that the great actor was '' an abridgment of all that was pleasant in man '' ; but at the same time '' He east off his friends , as a huntsman his pack .

		For he knew when he pleas 'd he could whistle them back .

		Of praise a mere glutton , he swallow 'd what came , And the puff of a dunce , he mistook it for fame . ''

		In point of editorship , the extreme care taken to reproduce , as far as possible in print , the letter-writer 's peculiarities of spelling and punctuation , his frequent use of the caret , and his arbitrary employment of capitals , tends to preserve the indefinable eighteenth-century atmosphere of the documents , but makes them less rapidly readable to twentieth-century eyes .

		In lack of an index , page-headings to show who is being addressed by the writer would have been very welcome ; sometimes it is impossible to determine this without some search , or to ascertain at once the probable date of a letter .

		The great number of extant
Garrick	PERSON	portraits has made possible the publication in this volume of many interesting pictures of the man and the actor .

		THE DIAL 203 in it . ''

		His only philosophy of history and criticism of life is a no'ire faith that a jealous Grod loves to humble swollen fortunes , '' but the little ones do not provoke him at all . ''

		Thuevdides , on the other liand , is a hard - heatled political
JK	ORGANIZATION	> siti ^ • ist , the ancestor of 3 > Iachiavelli and Guieciardini and La Rochefou - cauld , -- sensitive as a Greek and an artist to the dramatic values of historA ' .

		but as a thinker far more deeply interested in his cold cynical analysis of the conduct and motives of the political animal , man .

		There is no other his - toric narrative at once st > \ ivid and minute and so completely intelleetualized , so interpenetrated and fused with ethic ^ al and political reflection , as is Thucydides 's aw-ount of the Peloponnesian war .

		And the appreciative reader , however deeply he may feel the pity of what
Ruskin	PERSON	calls '' the central tragedy of all the world , the suicide of
Greece	LOCATION	. ''

		however sensitive he may be to the pathos of the Retreat from
Syracuse	LOCATION	which
Macaulay	DATE	and Gray thought the finest thing in historical literature .

		w `` ill still realize that it is this Thucydidean criticism of life that makes the History , in its author 's boast , `` a possession for all time , and not a prize composi - tion which is heard and forgotten . ''

		Though we have reaUy little means of con - trolling Thucydides 's statements of fact , this informing philosophy , and the impression pro- duced by his austere self-restraint in speaking of friend or foe , have matle his historical trust - worthiness almost an article of faith with modern critics .

		But dogmas are made to be challenged , and the challenge implied in Mr.
Comford	PERSON	's title , '' Thucydides Mj-thistori - cus , '' is maintained in his book in a fashion which will be stimulating : and sug ^ gestive even to those who c ^ annot accept its conclusions .

		Mr.
Comford	PERSON	does not impugn the conscious good - faith of the historian .

		He merely seeks to show that we are under an illusion when on the ground of certain striking utterances we attribute to him a completely consistent modem scientific and positivist point of view .

		Thucy - dides himself thought that he had discarded the old mytholog
> %	PERCENT	and endeavored to erplain everything by the ine ^ ^ table operation of the laws of human nature in given conditions .

		But the mythological imagination still dominated his mind , and it was imjx -RRB- ssible for him to cast his historj ' in any other mould than that which mythology and tragedy had imposed upon all Greek thought and art .

		In support of this thesis .

		Air .

		Comford expounds Thucydides 's general philosophy of hiunan nature , taking as his text the speech of Diodotus on the insufficiency of the fear of punishment to oomlMit Hope .

		Confidence , and
Passionate Desire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ex -RSB- X -RRB- sition corres - ponds so closely -- though from the lack of acknowledgment it would appear undesig - nedly -- with that which I -LRB- Irew from the same text in a jiaper on the - Implicit Ethics and Psychology of Thucydides , '' that I need only express my natural concurrence , without attempting to criticize .

		Here , however , the resemblance ends .

		The psycholognf which 1 worked out in illustration of Thucydides 's polite ical positi ^ ^ sm , Mr.
Comford	PERSON	r ^ ards as the starting-point of a new mj ` thology .

		You need only add capital letters to the elements of hu - man natiu ^ e in
Thucydides	LOCATION	's analysis , in order to reinstate the unseen djemonic personifications that govern human destiny in Greek poetry and tragedy .

		For this startlingly simple transfor - mation , we are , however , prepared by some general considerations against attributing to a thinker of that day a purely scientific attitude .

		Thucydides may seem to ignore the possibility of cMicrete supernatural inter \ `` ention in the course of human affairs , and he may have refused to affirm anything for which he had not good evi - dence : but he had no positive conception of what we mean by the • • reign of law '' to fill the gap .

		for the sciencjes did not yet exist .

		His explanations of historical events are individu - alistic and psychological , where ours are col - lective , economic , and sociological .

		He traces everything to the character , the motives , the hopes , fears , and desires of indi > - iduals , where our science recognizes large abstract economic and stx ^ ial laws inevitably determining the ac - tions of masses .

		Moreover , though chance may have Ijeen in theory for him what it is for us , a mere synonjTu of the incalculable , it could not in his imagination be excluded from a place among the ultimate causes of things by the more exact detail of mcxlem knowledge .

		Thus , what - ever his philosophic conviction , his dramatic instinct remained free to personify Chance or Fortune as a real agent coordinate or coopera - tive with the -LRB- capitalized -RRB- Personified Passions which his | > sychology discovered in human na - tiu ^ .

		And as a matter of fact , Mr.
Comford	PERSON	finds that Thucydides 's -LRB- inception of historical causes is unscientific , and that his narrative is uncon - sciously colored by poetic and dramatic pre - conceptions .

		He tells us .

		for example , that the real c-ause of the Peloponnesian War was the alarm felt by
Sparta	ORGANIZATION	at the growing power of 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the
Athenian Empire	ORGANIZATION	, Init that the causes openly avowed were the quarrels over Coreyi-a and
Potidsea	LOCATION	, which he proceeds to describe .

		The word which he uses for the real cause -LRB- pyoplia.six -RRB- might mean pretext , but probably does mean occasion employetl as a loose synonym for vaHae .

		The word used for the alleged causes is -LRB- litiai , which in philosophical Gi-eek means causes , but in early common usage rather suggests gi-iev - ances , or complaints .

		Anthropologists tell us that '' when pximitive man asks the cause of anything , he wants to know who is to blame . ''

		Mr.
Comford	PERSON	infers that Thucydides had neither the word nor the idea cauHc , but coidd speak only of grievances or pretexts .

		This , 1 think , is to press his accidental use of terms too hard .

		But Mr.
Cornford	PERSON	's argument need not rest on this verbal considei-ation .

		He tries to show that as a matter of fact Thucydides misap -RCB- -RRB- rehended the true causes of the war , which were e < ; onomic .

		Chief among them was the desire of the com - mercial population of
Athens	LOCATION	and the Peirieus to win the trade of the
West	LOCATION	.

		This they could do , in the absence of steam and the mariner 's compass , only by the Isthmian route .

		But
Corinth	LOCATION	and
Megara	LOCATION	held the Isthmus .

		The only chance of
Athens	LOCATION	, then , was to win over or subjugate
Megara	LOCATION	.

		Hence the decrees in - tended to coerce
Megara	LOCATION	, or starve her out by excluding her from all ports of the
Athenian Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Aristophanes and some of the later historians actually represent the Megarian de - ci-ees as the chief cause of the war .

		Thucydides himself lets fall a phrase or two that implies it .

		But lacking the modern scientific conception of the social and economic nature of historical causes , he falls back upon his pei `` sonal and psychological standpoint , and occupies himself chiefly with description of the feelings and argu - ments of Athenians ,
Corinthians	LOCATION	, and S -RCB- -RRB- artans , on the eve of the war .

		For the same reason , accordmg to Mr.
Corn	PERSON	- ford , in his account of subsequent campaigns in the Corinthian gidf , he fails to exhibit to us the i-eal unity of purjjose that determined Athenian activity in this direction , and gives us the im - pression of a series of disconnected and desultory enterprises .

		Similarly , though he enables us to infer , he fails to state clearly tliat the Sicilian expedition was merely the culmination of designs of imperial expansion in the West long cher - ished by the commei-cial party .

		His di-aniatic conception is that this lust for conquest in
Sicily	LOCATION	.


Italy	LOCATION	,
Carthage	LOCATION	even , was a tragic infatuation of the demagogxie-led democracy after tlie death of Pericles .

		And he is therefore unable , or instinctively unwilling , to give due prominence to the facts tliat show that the commercial and jwpular party atlvotjated this policy from the beginning , and that , as our author believes .

		Pericles himself was forced by this party to pass the Megaiian decrees .

		Such an admission would have marred the symmetry of his picture of the OljTnpian ruler who led the jieople but wa.s never led by them .

		This is all very ingen - ious , but it is still ojien to less subtle minds to believe that the main cause of the war was , as the historian affirms , Peloponnesian jealousy of the Athenian P ^ mpire .

		And surely Mr.
Coi-n	PERSON	- ford is inconsistent , both with himself and the plain facts , when he elsewhere suggests that Thucydides actually l -RRB- elieved that Pericles 's inveteracy against
Megara	LOCATION	was the ate of an inherited curse .

		For Thucydides clearly held that the war was well ai ^ lvised , and that
Athens	LOCATION	would have won but for the blunders of
Pericles	LOCATION	's successors .

		More plausible is Mr.
Cornford	PERSON	's contention that Thucydides 's apprehension of the facts of history , and still more the form of his artistic presentation of them , is determined by his imaginative conception of Fortime as the chief actor in a drama in which the jiersonified pas - sions of human nature take the other rblex .

		The real dramatic interest of the History begins , he tells us in the third book , with the first im - portant success of the Athenians -- the capture of the four huntbed Spartans at
Pylos	LOCATION	.

		It may be tliat this achievement was largely a stroke of luck .

		But Thucydides 's dramatic instinct leads him to represent it as wholly so .

		The war has been di-agging on monotonously , and is aj > - proaching a deadlock .

		A siulden intervention of Tuche as deus ex inachina exalts the Athenian temjier to the height of hope , greed , pride , and hubris , which leads Inevitably to the ti-agic reversal of fortune and the abyss of Ate .

		So the story wins an impressive unity .

		Mr.
Cornford	PERSON	, in his analysis of the tale of
Pylos	LOCATION	, tries to show -LRB- 1 -RRB- that a g-eneral impression of casualness and want of design is conveyetl by innumerable little touches ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that it is in fact highly improbable that either the occupa - tion of
Pylos	LOCATION	or the capture of the Spartans was as accidental as Thucydides represents them .

		However tliat may be , the di-amatic impi-ession of the decisive intervention of Tuche in a crisis of human affairs is confirmetl by the story of
Cleon	ORGANIZATION	's boast that he could capture the entrapped Spartans in a few days , and by the actual accoiuplishmeut of the vaiuit '' mud as it ivas . ''

		Cleon the demagogue becomes at this point a

Athens	LOCATION	.

		As his own nnexpet-ted good lack made hini fancy him-self a real general , filled him with inordinate hopes , and lure < l him to his doom in the Tliracian campaign , so the Athenian imperial democracy which he pre - figures , intoxicated by imexpected and unde - ser ^ ` cd triumph over

		This is the jwrt which , for all his posi - ti ^
Tsm	ORGANIZATION	, Thucydides assigns to Tuche in the destiny of men and cities .

		This is the psycho - logical mythologj ' with which he replaces the mythology of the jxjets .

		This is the mould of ^ Eschylean tragedy into which he casts the i drama of history - .

		, Mr.
Comford	PERSON	's elaboration of this analogy , and his minute and subtle c-omparisons with the Agamemnon , will especially interest that c-on - siderable body of students who , in the decay of | all ^ ^ -RRB- ry as an acc-eptcd literary - form , satisfy | the natural human instinct for this play of fancy by coquetting with the allegorical inter - pretation of the literature of the past .

		This would be a hamdess amusement if it did not
ine %	PERCENT	`` itably betray its devotees into the making of false points and the strained interpretation of their texts .

		That Thucytlides 's sense of the moral significance and the tlramatic contrasts of history wa-s quickeneil by reminiscences of ^ EschyleMi tragedy , is probable enough .

		But sober criticism will know how to make a light and tactful use of such suggestions without con - verting them into a rigid and systematic method of exegesis .

Nicobar Islands	LOCATION	.

		Recovering from a long illness , he made one or two trading expeditions in the
East Indies	LOCATION	, then obtained the post of master-gtmner at Bencoulen in
Sumatra	LOCATION	, and finally succeetled in reaching
England	LOCATION	again in
1691	DATE	.

		Of his movements during the next six years almost nothing is known .

		In
1697	DATE	, how - ever , he published his first volume . ''

		A New Voyage Roimd the World . ''

		which brought him into general notice , and paved the wa -RRB- ' for his later works .

		These are included in the present reprint .

		Through the influence now at ^ nired ,
Dampier	PERSON	was sent in
1698	DATE	to explore the coasbs of
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Guinea	LOCATION	, etc. , an undertaking which added little to his fame ; for on the way home his ship `` founderetl through perfect age at the Island of Ascension , '' and , when rescued , he returned in 1 702 .

		oidy to be fined by court - martial for alleged severity to his lieutenant .

		Subsequently he was accused of incompetence as commander of a privateer in the South Seas : whereupon he made answer in his ill-tempered and not whoUv reassuring • • Vindication . ''

		In
1708	DATE	, on his fourth circumna \ Tgation of the ^ obe , he was pilot to Captain Woodes-Rogers , who liberated Alexander Selkirk -LRB-
Cowper	ORGANIZATION	's 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Selkiili -RRB- from the '' Isle of
John Fernando	PERSON	, '' and who from various sources , during a cruise of three years and a half , '' conveyed '' booty to the amount of nearly a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		On this cruise one of
Dampier	PERSON	's companions was the superstitious
Hatley	PERSON	, the man who , on a previous voyage with
Shelvocke	PERSON	, had shot the albatross which was later to be immortalized by
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	in '' The Rime of the Ancient Mariner . ''

		Dampier died in
London	LOCATION	in
1715	DATE	.

		So much for his life externally .

		But what was the gentle iilibuster himself ?

		Let us look at his picture as reproduced in Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's fii-st volume ; or , rather , let us listen to Admiral
Smyth	PERSON	's description of the original by
Murray	PERSON	in '' The National Porti-ait OaUery '' : '' The face is resolute and grave , sailor-like and weather-beaten , with considerable breadth above the eyes , and the forehead shadowed by a profusion of dark auburn hair , which reaches to the shoidders .

		The body is well-built but spare ... He is habited in a light - blue coat with vellum button-holes , and weai-s a wliite neck - cloth of suftieient volume to startle a Beau Brumrael ... The attitude is easy ; and m his right hand is -LSB- a copy of -RSB- '
Dampier	PERSON	's Voyages , ' conveniently turned toward the i-eader . ''

		This sketch tallies fairly well with a glimpse of the long and lank and brown man given by himseK : '' It was well for Captain Swan -LSB- says
Dampier	PERSON	of their arrival at the island of
Guam	LOCATION	-RSB- thiit we got sight of it before om ' pi-ovision was spent , of which we had but enough for three days more ; for , as I was after - wards informed , the men had contrived , tirst to kill Captain Swan and eat him when the victuals were gone , and after him all of us who were accessory in promoting the undertaking of this voyage .

		This made Captain Swan say to me ... '' Ah !

		Dampier , you would have made them but a poor meal ; ' for I was as lean as the Captain was lusty aud fleshy . ''

		It is pathetic , urges Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, -- `` To think of him -LSB- ' a man , ' as
Coleridge	PERSON	says , ` of exquisite refinement of mind ' -RSB- , wi-iting up his jom-nal , describing a bmich of flowers , or a Rire fish , in the intervals between looting a wine-ship and sacking a vil - lage ... His best book was written aboard a buccaneer cruiser , amid the drunkemiess and noise of his sliip - mates .

		He must have gone without sleep many times -LRB- a sailor will appreciate the .

		sacrifice -RRB- in order to ` take a sm-vey , ' or drawing of the coast .

		When he went ashore he did not follow liis mates into the rumshops ... -LSB- ' I did ever abhor dnmkeuness , ' he declares . -RSB-

		He exaramed the natives and the comitry , aud jotted down every detail of every bird , beast , tree , and fruit , which he chanced to see ... The supreme faithfidness of
Dampier	PERSON	's chronicling can only be gauged by those who take the trouble to compare the work of even the very best of the chronielei-s who have succeeded him . ''

		In an age when
Dryden	PERSON	and Pope ha ^ : !

		taught
England	LOCATION	to gaze at natui-e through a distorting - atmosphere of pseudo-Latin rhetoric ,
Dampier	PERSON	is almost unique , even among ti-aveUers , for his Greek way of seeing things as they were . ''

		All men , '' observes Aristotle , though he must have been thinking chiefly of his own race , '' all men by nature desire to know . ''


Dampier	PERSON	was one of those in whom the desire had become a passion .

		Of
Dampier	PERSON	's career and character as a whole .

		Admiral
Smyth	PERSON	gives the following summary , which could scai-cely be bettered : '' On a strict , and we hojK - impai ` tial , investigation , it appears that his mind was acute , sagacious , and compre - hensive ; and none of tlie misadventures that we have related can be traced to his want of ability or conduct .

		Though cast by fortune upon a course of life which he never attempted to justify or palliate , and amidst the vicissitudes and temptations to which it exposed him , he never imbibed the virus of such vicious companionship .

		Embarking with those marauders rather from a desire of acquiring knowledge , tlian the usual motives which influenced his shipmates , the constant and powerful opei-ation of this desire preserved his mind untainted .

		Hence , even among the lawless , liis attitude was vigor - ous and commanding ; and whenever his companions were in extreme danger , his skill and experience , whieli were always available , secured him their respect and obedience .

		If we except the capital error of falling into that course , full approbation must be rendered to his justice , moderation , liberaUty , temperance , piety , and himianity . ''

		And now for
Dampier	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		In Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's reprint the type is clear and the editing generally excellent .

		The introductory memoir might indeed have been fuller , for Admiral
Smyth	PERSON	's standard biographical sketch in the `` United Ser \ ` ice Journal '' is now seventy years old , and no longer ea.sy to find .

		From Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's index we miss several entries , among them the name of Selkirk .

		For the rest , let
Dampier	PERSON	be his own chief spokesman . ''

		As for the Actions of the Company among whom I made the greatest part of this -LSB- the ' New ' -RSB- Voyage , a Thread of which I have carried on thro ' it , ' t is not to divert the Reader with them that I mention them , much less that I take any pleasure in relating them : but for methods sake .

		... As to my Stile , it can not be expected , that a Seaman should affect Politeness ... My chief Cai'e hath l -RRB- een to be as particidar as was consistent with my intended brevitj ' , in setting down such
Observ	LOCATION	- ables as I met \ vith . ''

		Here is one of his '' Observables , '' taken almost at random : '' The Sea-Lion is a large Creature about 12 or 14 foot long .

		The biggest part of his Body is as big as a Bull : It is shaped like a Seal , but six times as big .

		The Head is like a Lion 's Head ; it hath a broad Face with many long Hah 's growing about its Lips like a Cat .

		It has a great Goggle Eye , the Teeth 3 inches long , aljout the bigness of a Man 's Tlmmb : In Captain Sharp 's time , some of our Men made Dice with them .

		In his touches of narrative ,
Dampier	PERSON	is Wjually neat . ''

		March the 22d , 1 -LRB- 584 , we came in sight of -LSB-
Juan Fernandez	PERSON	-RSB- , and the next day ... went ashore to see for a Moskito Indian , whom we left here when we were chased hence by 3 Spanish Ships in the year
1681	DATE	; ... Capt.
Watlin	PERSON	being then our Commander .

		• ` He was in the
Woods	LOCATION	, hunting for Goats , when Capt.
Watlin	PERSON	drew off his Men , and the Sliip was imder sail before he came back t < i shore .

		He luul with him his
Gtm	ORGANIZATION	and a Knife , with a small Horn of Powder , and a few Shot ; which being spent , he contrived a way by notching his Knife , to saw the Barrel of his Gun into small Pieces , wherewith he made Harpoons ,
Lauces	LOCATION	, Hooks and a long knife : heating the pieces first in the fire , which he struck with his Gun-flint ... '' With such instruments as he made in that manner , he got such Provision as the
Island	LOCATION	afforded ; either Goats or Fish .

		He told us that at first he was forced to eat Seal , which is very ordinary Meat , before he had made Hooks : but afterwards he never kiUed any Seals but to make Lines , cutting their Skins into Thongs .

		He had a little
House	ORGANIZATION	or Hut lialf a Mile from the Sea , which was lin 'd with Gojits Skin ; his Couch or Barbecu of Sticks lying along about 2 foot distant from the Ground , was spread with the same , and was aU his Bedding ... He came then to the Sea side to con - gratulate onr safe Arrival .

		And when we landed , a Moskito Indian , named
Robin	PERSON	, first leap 'd ashore , and mnning t < i his Brother Moskito Man , threw himself flat on his face at his feet , who helping him up , and | embracing him , fell flat with his face on the Ground at
Robin	PERSON	's feet , and was by him taken up also ... He was named Will , as the other was
Kobin	PERSON	.

		These were ' , names g ^ iven them by the English ; for ... they take ; it as a great favour to be named by any of us ; and will complain for want of it , if we do not appoint them some name when they are with us ; saying of themselves they ; are poor Men , and have no Name . ''

		That is the sort of living material from which , imaginative tales of adventure
spring	DATE	.

		VIr .


Masefield	PERSON	and his publishers have done well to bring the material in
Dampier	PERSON	before the public again , if only for its interest in the history of literature .

		There can be little doubt that this naive and veracious ' • Journal of every Days Observa - tions '' had an extended iuHuence on some of the literature that followed it .

		Swift , though he makes Captain
Lemuel Gulliver	PERSON	sneer at • • my cousin
Dampier	PERSON	. ''

		must imdemeath his satire have really felt an admiratiou for the simplicity and directness of the buccaneer 's English .

		As for
Defoe	PERSON	, it would be fascinating to study out the connection between
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	and
Dampier	PERSON	's ' • Voyages , '' or between these and
Defoe	PERSON	's own '' New Voyage Round the World . ' ''

		It would be still more profitable .

		no doubt , to determine what effect a highly popular yet essentially scientific record , such as
Dampier	PERSON	's , may have had upon the imaginative prose of the early eighteenth century ; for the so-called • ' return to nature , ' which finds its fullest expression in the poetry at the beginning of the nineteenth , begins to show itself in non - metrical tales like ' • Gulliver , '' '' Crusoe , '' and ■ • Rassela.s '' -- all founde < l on the literature of travel -- far earlier than in eighteenth century verse .

		Were there space , we ought to notice , too , the literary relations of the age of
Cowper	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, with the class of writings to which
Dampier	PERSON	's belong : for example , the use to which
Wordsworth	PERSON	, in a later version of '' The Blind Highland Boy , '' put the anecdote told by
Dampier	PERSON	about the little son of Captain Rocky , who went aboard his father 's ship in an inunense tortoise-sheU .

		But we must close rather with a glance at our own day .

		What has lately occa-sioned the reissue of so many half - forgotten lxK -RRB- ks of travel and explo - ration ?

		In part , of course , the activity displayed in reviving such works is artificial , stimulated by enterprising publishers , and answering to the factitious needs of emidous libraries .

		In part , also , the interest is scholarly : volumes like these of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, or the
Hakluyt Society	ORGANIZATION	's reprint of '' Purchas his Pilgrims , '' or Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's series of '' Early Western Travels . ''

		meet the demaj ^ ds of the historian and the geographer for acee.ssible works of reference , where , to the isolate < l investigator , the original editions may be wholly out of reach .

		But the rapidity with which obsolete itineraries have been republished within the
last decade	DATE	or s seems to argue something more noteworthy than a mere inflation of the book market , something more important , even , than the satisfaction of .

		scholars .

		It seems to argue a wider popular interest in at least one side of past hnman ex - perience , at a time when experience , if it is to gain a hearing , must not in general be verj ' old .

		The -RCB- x -RRB- pidarization of
Dampier	PERSON	in his own age precede ! ''

		Robinson Crusoe '' and `` Gulliver . ''

		The resurrection of
Dampier	PERSON	and innumerable other travellei-s , that took place a century or more ago , was a potent influence in the revi \ - al of honest observation and true poetry under
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Can it be that the present vigor shown by editors like Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	will , 1 -RRB- y teaching us again to see the external world as it is , unlock the sources of our now languisliing poetry ?

Oct. 1	DATE	, KVOLUTION AND
THK	ORGANIZATION	ORIGIN Ol' JjIFK .

		* The past ten years have witnessetl a remark - able development in the science of biology , and especially in that jwrtion of it which has to do with the problem of organic evolution .

		The trend of biological work as a whole has in this period taken a sliarji turn away from the path it had previously been following .

		Formerly , the orthoilox and prevailing metho < l of studying the problem of life was the truly oriental one of fii-st caref idly killing the creature to be studied and then with infinite pains proceeding to scru - tinize its minute structure .

		Having acquired some data on this point , it was obviously a simple and not impleasant process to spm out theories as to the significance for the life of the individual or the species of all the structiu-al peculiarities found .

		Applying certain general ndes -LRB- carefidly compiled in
Haeckel	LOCATION	's `` Gen - ei-elle Morphologic '' -RRB- to the conduct of this pleasant game , it was jjossible , in the period between the appearance of the `` Origin of Species '' and say
1896	DATE	, to build up an im - | -RRB- osing mass of litemture regarding the genetic relationships of animals .

		Toward the end of this period , however , the feeling began to become widespread that no substantial gain in our know - le < lge of how organic evolution actually takes platie had been made by the method of attack - ing the problem which had been in vogue .

		Many investigators began to wonder whether a somewhat less mdirect mode of research -- -LRB- me which should deal with living organisms , and treat evolution as a process -- might not reasonably be expected to advance knowledge rather more mpidly .

		As a result of this change of view-point , we have seen in the last decade a swing of the pendulum of biological investigation away from the so-called '' pure '' morphology over to the experimental side of the subject .

		The i-esults , even in so short a period as a decade , have been remarkable .

		To mention only some of those which have hatl to do directly with the problem of evol - • Darwinism and thb Peoblems op Life .

		ution , we have fii-st in importance the won - derfid experiments of De Vries , in which the actual origin of new elementary species has been directly observed .

		Closely related to this work on mutation lias lieen the accunuda - tion of residts carrying us toward a precise knowledge of perhaps the most fundamental of biological processes , -- namely , hei-edity .

		Start - ing in
1897	DATE	^ vith the publication , by
Karl Pearson	PERSON	, the English mathematician-biologist , of exact determinations of the intensity of inheritance in given cases , and receiving a fresh impetus in
1900	DATE	with the `` rediscovery '' of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's laws of alternative inheritance , there has been a triUy remarkable advance of knowl - edge in this field .

		Not only has the change of biological view - point to which we have alluded stimulated investigatoi-s to unprecedented activity in the study of evolution , but also , as usually happens in such cases , it has led to the production of a whole series of '' popidar '' books on evolution and related topics .

		It is with a few of this season 's product of these less technical exposi - tions of the present trend of biological thought that we liave to do here .

		On the basi.s of subject-matter , we may divide the.se books intt -RRB- two groups .

		The fu-st group , dealing with organic evolution in the usually accepted sense , includes
Guenther	PERSON	's '' Darwinism and the Prob - lems of Life , '' Lock 's `` Recent Progress , '' Heatlley 's '' Life and Evolution , '' and
Jordan	PERSON	and
Kellogg	PERSON	's '' Evolution and Animal Life '' : the second gi'oup , dealing with the more recon - dite problem of that which precedes organic ?

		evolution , the origin of life itself , includes Le
Dantec	PERSON	's `` Origin of Life '' and
Bastian	PERSON	's '' Evolution of Life . ''

		Taken as a whole , this array of titles is imposing .

		Do the contents fulfil the promise of the titles of the volumes ?

		In the preface of the first book on our list , '' Darwinism and the Problejns of Life , '' Pro- fessor Guenther tells us that '' The present work had its origin in an attempt to appreciate the range , the foundation , and the value of evo - lutionary theories . ''

		As the result of this '' attempt , '' the author comes to the conclusion that on the whole the only theories of evolution worthy of credence are those of his academical colleague ,
Weismann	PERSON	.

		All the recent experi - mental work of De Vries and others on evolution has for liim no special significance so far as the fimdamentals are concerned .

		In no doubtful terms does he express his opinion of deviations from the orthodox Weismaimian creed .

		Thus , regarding the mutation theory he says -LRB- p. 347 -RRB- :
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 '' Hence the multiplicity of our actual species can not be due to mutations . ''

		This ought to be final .

		The theory of orthogenesis -- diat definitely directed variations occur in nature , and are an important factor in progressive evo - luticm -- receives no kinder treatment , though in the last few years much definite experimental eNntlence in its favor ha-s appeared .

		Taken a.s a whole , that portion of Dr.
Guenthers	PERSON	book which deals strictly with biology c-an Ijest be characterized as sadly behind the times .

		It iloes not ^ ve a truthful picture of current sci - entific opinion regarding the problem of organic evolution .

		The last two chapters deal with the broad philosophic aspects of evolution .

		The author 's standpoint is one of curiously mangled idealism .

		Dinge an '' ich are all about us , but • • natural science does not present reality to us as it is . ''

		Reality is '' infinite '' and ' • incom - prehensible . ''

		A considerable portion of the final chapter deals
\ %	PERCENT	` ith ethical questions .

		The best that the author can offer us here is : '' The utmost that science can say is that an ethic , a setting-up of ends to be attained , has no meaning .

		It can only direct a man to let him - .

		self be borne in peace on the stream of cause and effect , without doing anything , because his action could have no aim and no residt .

		The only possible scientific ethic is resignation . ''

		All this would be amusins .

		were it not for the possibility that someone might take it as an authoritative statement of the real standpoint of science .

		If Professor
Guenther	PERSON	's book is l > ehind the times , certainly the same can not be said of Mr.
Lock	PERSON	's account of '' Rec-ent Progress in the
Study of Variation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Heredity - , and Evolution . ''

		the second work on our list .

		This is strictly up to date , -- so much so , ind ^ ied , as to run a little risk of being labeled '' frenzied biology . ''

		and as to have verj ' t ^ rtainly only an ephemeral \ - alue .

		The author has been actively engaged in the study of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's laws of heredity in plants , and the present book is plainly to be regarded as an outlet for the enthusiasm thus engendered for the newest in biolt ^ .

		After a brief and rather perfunctory outline of the Darwinian theory - of the method of organic evo - lution , in which nothing new is contributed , the author proceeds to give a clear and very readable summary of -LRB- a -RRB- recent work in biometry -LRB- the application of quantitative methods to the study of evolution problems -RRB- , -LRB- i -RRB- the work of De Vries on mutations , and -LRB- < • -RRB- the investigations of alter - native mheritance inspired by the rediscoverj - of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's laws .

		On the whole , this is prob - ably the best a > - ailable book from which the layman may get a rea-onably complete and non - technical account of recent investigations in the last two of the three fields covered .

		Unfor - tunately , the treatment of the subjects is not strictly even and impartial .

		All three of them are more or less subjects of OMitroversy .

		and especially bitter has been the c < mtrover8y between the workers in biometry on the one hand and in
Mendelism	LOCATION	on the other hand .

		Mr.
L/ock	PERSON	happ ^ is to be a ver ^ ' enthusiastic Mendelist .

		as has l > een said ; consequently it has resulted that the treatment of biometrical work given in the book is very adversely critical , while the treatment of Mendelism is altogether uncritical .

		Lea ^ Tug out this rather serious defect , the book has much to recommend it .

		ilr .

		Headley 's '' • Life and Evolution '' is an expansion of a series of lectures on general biology to an audience entirely untrained in this sci ^ ice .

		The aim of the lectures and ai the book is to give the clearest possible account of some of the main types of structural and psychic diversity found in animals , together with an exposition of current views as to how these various types came into existence in the course of organic evolution .

		Everyone will grant that this is a most laudable purpose , and , further , that if the task is well done the result will stand as a notable contribution to popular biological literature .

		It may be said at aooe that -RSB- ^ Ir .


Headley	PERSON	has done very well indeed what he set out to do in this book .

		In the reviewer 's opinion , there exists no other book which in the field tovered can ccMupare in gen - eral excellence with this .

		Everywhere free of technicalities , simple without being siUy , never shirking the difficult and abstruse problems of biology but rather elucidating the best of present-day opinions regarding them , the author has told and illustrated the general outlines of the story of the evolution of animals in a mas - terly \ '' - ay .

		The keynote of the bo -LRB- ^ is the con - sideration of the structures .

		of animals from the point of view of adaptation .

		This is good ; and the `` ^ y the point is worked out in the book is better .

		The procedure here is not that so com - mon in popidar works on evolution , of discussing adaptation as an abstract proposition and then illustrating it with a few stock examples which have been overworked to the point of exhaustion .

		Instead , our author takes a series of ob \ 4ous structures of common animals and shows spe - cifically how these structures individually are of a character to help the possessor in its struggle for existence under the conditions in which it 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, finds itself .

		Thus , for example , it is brought out \ vith gi-eat clearness how those stnictural characteristics , both superficial and skeletal , which differentiate a bird from a reptile are adaptations to avian conditions of existence .

		This leads naturally to a discussion of the flight of birds , and the jjroblem of flight in general .

		In this field the author is able , from his long exjjerience in bird study , to speak with unique authority , and his discussion is one which may be read even by the specialist with profit as well as plea-sure .

		While primarily a book for the ' • general reader , '' the volume entitled '' Life and Evo - lution '' will , unless we are greatly mistaken , l -RRB- e warmly welcomed by the teachers of nature - study in the secondary and normal schools .

		It will prove a mine of information and suggestion for them .

		The book is copiously and -LRB- imfor - tunately -RRB- unevenly illusti-ated .

		Some of the original photographs are excellent , while the line-drawings in some instances are so crude as greatly to mar the appearance of an other - wise well-made book .

		The captious critic who searches for minute errors will find some , but they are so relatively few in number and so clearly the outcome of the '' popidar lecture '' method of presentation as haixUy to call for men - tion in view of the general excellence of the work as a whole .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	and Professor KeUogg 's '' Evo - lution and Animal Life '' is , like Mr.
Headley	PERSON	's book , the outgrowth of a course of popular lectures on evolution , with the difference that in the present case the lectures were delivered to an audience of imiversity students .

		On the whole , it must be said that the x-esult of the transcription of lectures into book form is not so happy in the case of the American as in the case of the English book , probably on account of the very fact of the difference in the audiences in the two instances .

		There is an unmistakeable and insistent didactic flavor to '' Evolution and Animal Life , '' which never allows the rea < ler to forget that the aim of tliis \ vriting is to teach undergraduate students as much as may be about organic evolution .

		The scope of the work is more extensive , and the treatment of the whoR subject of evolution more thorough -LRB- in a pedagogical sense -RRB- m this than in any of the other books on our list .

		This may be indi - cated by a summary statement of the contents .

		The first three chaptei-s are occupied with pre - liminary definitions of evolution and discussions of the physical basis of life , the simplest forms of life , the meaning of species , and similar fun - damental points .

		The next eight chapters deal with the various theories as to the method of evolution which have been proposed , and the facts and supjwsed facts of nature on which they have been based .

		The remaining ten chapters are devoted to special topics related to the subject of evolution .

		They include discussions of such matters as sex , ontogenetic development , paleontology , geogi-aphical distribution , para - sitism , adaptations , communal life of animals , coloration , psychic life of animals , and '' man 's pla ^ - e in nature . ''

		The treatment of these topics follows fairly closely the conventional lines which have become i-ather definitely established in the univei ` sity teaching of evolution in this country , but introduces much of the most recent work which has been done in the field covered .

		It hardly needs saying in an American journal that the book is well written , authoritative , and suggestive .

		It would be difficult , if not impos - sible , to find a better work to put in the hands of serious students of evolution , to be used either as a text-book or for so-called '' collateral reading . ''

		The two books in our second division , the oi'igin of life , require but brief discussion .

		Le Dan tec 's contribution is a volume of two hmidi-ed and fifty pages , which , according to the title , ha.s to do with the • ' Nature and Origin of Life . ''

		Regarding the '' nature of life , '' the author assui-es us at great length that life is a mechanism .

		The '' proof '' of this is rather de - vious , but essentially appears to depend as a foundation oil the fact that living protoplasm is matter in the colloidal state of iiggregation .

		The superstructure of the proof consists of a redis - cussion of the elementary known facts of biology in a mathematical terminology , which for logi - cal imperativeness compares not imfavorably with the old doggerel , -- '' If A is a tiirilip .

		And B is a flea , Then C equals tweedle - Duindee . ''

		The discussion of the '' origin of life '' is under - taken on the two hmidred and forty-eighth page .

		On the two himdi-ed and fiftieth -LRB- and last '' -RRB- page , the author tells us that '' The problem of protoplasm synthesis remains what it was . ''

		Nothing coiUd be more cei ` tain than this , so far BS any contribution by Le Dantec is .

		con - cerned .

		Dr. Ba-stian 's most recent contribution , the last book of our list , is mainly of historical interest .

		It is a detailed and somewhat belated state - ment of his side of the controversy over the .

		Tliis thesLs was immediately attacked by one of the greatest figures in the history of biological science ,

		It was .

		and has remained , the verdict of the world that the exjieriments of these two men successfully and fLnall -RCB- ' refuted Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	's thesis .

		After more than thirty years ' work and thought on the subject , he is .

		however , more than ever conN-inced that he is right and that everj ` body else is wrong on this ob ^ - iously important question .

		Unfortunately , it is greatly to be doubted whether the present book will win anyone to his position .

		Ingenious and striking some of the new experiments citetl certainly are : but it will be very difficult to find any biologist who will be convinced that they deinoiDttrate the truth of the conclusion drawn from them by Dr. ^ '' ^ tian .

		* It is a commonplace observation in science , that as knowledge advances there is a corresponding change in the scientific vocabulary .

		In the science of transportation there is , consequently , a change in the language .

		The old poetic glamor which hangs about the terms associate < l with the old modes of travel -- the palanquin , the se < lan chair , the post - chaise , and the stage-coach , linked with their com - i panion terms , the old
North Road	LOCATION	, the tavern , the great roast and the rtagon -- is no longer ours .

		Long ago we lost the beautiful significance of '' sauntering , '' '' sojourning . '' ''

		wandering . '' '

		• pil - -RSB- grimage . ''

		and even of so modem a term as '' a ' walking tour . ''

		To-day Kipling sings of the beauty of the '' liner '' and the glorj - of a locomotive , and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	pays a fervid tribute to the '' ` wonderful ; unknown beast , '' the automobile .

		- Both these writers are artists in fine feelings , with a sensitive regard for fine language ; but the average reader , when he | thinks of the glory of motion , reverts to De

		modern transportatioo , with its cry for speed , will satisfy his demand for the poetry of travel as did these masters .

		Mr.
Francis Miltoun	PERSON	, in his book entitled `` The Automobilist Abroad . ''

		well says that '' A certain picturesqueness of travel may be wanting when comparing the automobile with the whirling coacb - and-four of other days , but there is vastly more comfort for all concerned , and no one will regret the march of progress when he considers that noth - ing but the means of transportation has changed .

		The delightful prospects of hill and vale are still there , the long stretches of silent road , and , in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, great forest routes which are as wild and unbroken , except for the magnificent surface of the roads , as they were when mediaeval travellers startled the deer and the wild boar . ''

		The poetrj - of motion has a new sensation in its cata - logue of virid impressions .

		Mr.
Miltoim	PERSON	's enthusi - asm for the motor-car , however , does not overbalance the practical and practicable problems of touring abroad .

		Every point of such a tour -- hotels , routes , road-building , the touring clubs , road-signs , motor - car regulations , and customs duties in
Europe	LOCATION	, maps and road-books , famous European road-races , and famous hUl climbs -- is adequately and interestingly recounted by the author of this book , who has toured man -RCB- - thousands of miles on the Continent and in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and who , if we count the items in his index of places , has visited over six himdred towns and cities in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		As the average motorist develops a marvellous appetite , the author gives much space to the question of inns and hotels ; and having both suffered and rejoiced in many places ^ of entertainment , he speaks with authority and with distinct feeling regarding the good and inferior inns one meets while motoring .

		Concerning the roads travelled , he ' places
France	LOCATION	as the land par exed - lenee for touring .

		After
France	LOCATION	comes
Great Britain	LOCATION	, with snug littie touring grounds and excel - lent roads .


Germany	LOCATION	, where touring is in high favor , has all sorts and conditions of roads , from the best in
Baden	LOCATION	, the
Palitinate	LOCATION	and the
Grand Duchy of Hesse	ORGANIZATION	, to poor in the central and northern prorinces .

		Swiss roads are thoroughly good every - where , but many of them , partictilarly mountain - roads , are closed to automobile traffic In
Belgium	LOCATION	there are immeasurable stretches of the vilest pave - ment in the world .

		Italian roads are variable , but generally good on the main lines of travel .

		Auto - uiobiling in
Spain	LOCATION	is a thing of the future .

		With characteristic humor , Mr.
Miltoun	PERSON	discountenances the disarmament of European nations , as the rival nations are inclined to keep their frontier roads in unusually good condition .

		The grand tour of other days has become , in the parlance of the European motorist , the '' Circuit Europ ^ n. '' Beginning at
Paris	LOCATION	, the tourist descends through Poitou to
Biarritz	LOCATION	, thence along the French slope of the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	, skirting the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coast by
Marseilles	LOCATION	and
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	, thence to
Genoa	LOCATION	, north to
Milan	LOCATION	and 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, to
Vienna	LOCATION	-LRB- the outpost for automobile supplies and comforts -RRB- , and returns to
Paris	LOCATION	by way of
Prague	LOCATION	,
Breslau	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Hanover	LOCATION	,
Cologne	LOCATION	, and
Reims	LOCATION	.

		This route is about thirty-one hundred miles long , and requires from twenty-five to thirty days to make the run .

		Much of the route is more extensively used by motorists tlian any other route in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Such a tour , Mr.
Miltoun	PERSON	assures us , '' in all its illuminating variety is far and away ahead of the benefits our forefathers derived from the box-seat of a diligence or a post-chaise . ''

		The four '' parts '' of Mrs.
Grace Gallatin Seton	ORGANIZATION	's book bearing the title '' Ninirod 's Wife '' narrate the adventures , both gi-ave and gay , of herself and hus - band , with their companions , in tlie
Sierras	LOCATION	, the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	, on the
Ottawa	LOCATION	, and in Noi-way .

		In a prefatory note Mrs.
Seton	PERSON	says : '' The events herein recorded really liajjpened , although some latitude has been taken as to time and place ; and one experience may seem to follow fast upon another , because , necessarily , the best of all lias been omitted -- the glorious succession of eventless days when one was content to be alive and care-free . ''

		This happily-phrased note disarms the critic , who other - wise might question the plausible rapid-fire incidents which occur in breathless succession .

		To read of Mrs.
Seton	PERSON	's adventures in the
Sierras	LOCATION	, where she began her outing by making a burlesque plunge into an icy-cold pool whose only other occupant was a writhing water-snake , and then to visit a hut with a frantic woman whose husband lay dead there , to have an exciting time with a Mexican sheej > herder whose ill-treated dog had wisely followed the author 's • party -LRB- the dog which ultimately saved the party fi-om a Juggernaut-like assault from a bull -RRB- down to the account of a tiny field-mouse whose efforts to escape from the heavy canvass on which the rubber bed rested caused the author to imagine and to suffer the thought that the sneaking insinuating motion was made by a rattlesnake , -- to read of all these inci - dents is to know that Mrs.
Seton	PERSON	's preface was war - ranted , and , indeed , necessary . ''

		In the Rockies '' contains an interesting account of a ride through a burning forest -- - and it occun-ed on the
Fourth of July	DATE	I Another chapter in the same part tells about a fantastic Fantail Ghost and a
Jack Rabbit Dance	PERSON	, both capitally told and charmingly illustrated . ''

		On the
Ottawa	LOCATION	'' contains a good story of the author 's fishing for the muscallonge .

		Her adventures in
Norway	LOCATION	were confined to kodak-lmnting for rein - deer .

		Whatever mental reservations we may make regarding the quick succession of adventures of Mi-s .

		Seton , we can unreservedly praise her for her quick wit and catching humor , for her thorough-going sportsman-like manner , and for the literary graces of good composition .

		The illustrations , too , made by Mr.
Walter King	PERSON	Stone and the author 's husband , Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	, are in pleasing har - mony with the spirit and the purpose of the book .

		A story goes that Mr.
F. C. Selous	PERSON	, the famous English hunter of big game , was nicknamed '' Zealous '' by his companions at Rugby .

		Whether true or not , the title is nevertheless a fitting one for the man who so zealously hunts all wild things , from the nests and eggs of tlie nut-cracker in
Bosnia	LOCATION	to the game giants of
Africa	LOCATION	and of
British North America	LOCATION	.

		It is now a goodly number of years since Mr.
Selous	PERSON	went out to
Africa	LOCATION	, to make his living with gun and rifle , and to write entertaining books of adventure on that paradise of big-game hunters .

		In recent years -- since about
1900	DATE	-- Mr.
Selous	PERSON	has limited his expeditions largely to
British North America	LOCATION	, in
Central Canada	LOCATION	,
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, and the
Yukon Country	ORGANIZATION	, where he has lumted for specimens of fine heads of the moose , caribou , and wild sheep .

		His latest book , '' Recent Hunting Trips in
Britisli North America	LOCATION	, '' .

		is made up of transcripts from his diaries which were written nightly over the camp-fire .

		One would very naturally expect that such trips woidd fairly bristle with thrilling adven - tures ; but such is not the manner of Mr.
Selous	PERSON	's narrative , nor is his method of liunting big game of such a nature that it invites a breath-holding nar - rative .

		Mr.
Selous	PERSON	's 2 -RRB- repai'ations for his hunts are so orderly , his stalking is so business-like , and his results are generally so workmanlike , that the reader will often pause to wonder wliere the sport conies in .

		But Mr.
Selous	PERSON	is not a parlor sportsman , nor is lie a believer in batteau hunting -- a form of hunting in high favor in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, where tlie caribou are shot in hundreds from ambush in tlieir semi-annui ^ l migi-ations across the land .

		Rather , he prefers to take a canoe , a guide , and some neces - saries , penetrate the game-haunted forests far from the beaten paths of wanton skin-hunters , and there select and kill a few old male animals with good heads wliicli will serve as mementoes and specimens .

		To kill the female , unless for food supjily , meets his disapproval .

		That the author can let game go unmolested , is shown by this story of a caribou doe and fawn : ■ ■ Wlien I first saw the deer thev were about one hundred and fifty yai ` ds away ; and as the wind was blowing down - stream they uouhl not possibly scent me , so I sat down on a rock and waited for them .

		They came slowly along , picking their way amongst the stones .

		... I sat in fiUl view , about midway between the bank and the water , holding my rifle across my knees , and remained absolutely motionless .

		■ ■ The doe never noticed me at all , and I am sure never for one moment imagined that I was not a part of the stone on which I was .

		sitting .

		She passed slowly between me .

		and the bank , and at one time was certjiiuly not four feet away from me .

		The fawn walked right onto me , and when its nose was almost touching my knees , must have smelt me , as it stopped , and stood looking into ray face with its nostrils twitching .

		I remained perfectly still , and it then turned aside , and walking past me rejoined its mother , without , however , seeming to have taken alarm . ''

		Such a pictm ' e reveals much -- the wonderful con - trol of the hunter , the unsuspicious nature of the animals , and a golden opportunity for the hunter with a kodak .

		But Mr.
Selous	PERSON	is not a kodak hunter .

		He frankly admits that the telling shot which bags the game is the sport that appeals to him .

		He does admire the • • poor brute '' in his
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		213 natural surroundings , but he can not withhold the shot which will add a - ` gootl head '' -- to be measured in inches and to be counted in points -- to his col - lection or to the niuseuTu at
South Kensington	LOCATION	. ''

		Ten thousand years of superficial and unsatisfying civ - ilization have not altered the fundamental nature of man , and the snccessful hunter of to-day becomes a primeval savage , remorseless , triumphant , full of a wild exultant joy , which none but those who have lived in the wilderness and de - pended upon their success as hunters for their daily food can ever know or comprehend . ''

		Our two quotations reveal , we think , the two sides of the author -- the nature-lover and the head-hunter .

		The very title of Captain
F. C. Dickinson	PERSON	's book , '' Big Game Shooting on the Equator , '' leads the reader to anticipate some thrilling tales of a < lventure , recortls of some remarkable shots , accounts of haii '' - breadth escapes , and some worthy descriptions of natural scenery in ever-wonderful
Africa	LOCATION	.

		None of these virtues , however , distinctly mark
Captain Dickinson	ORGANIZATION	's volume .

		Were it not for the excellent illustrations , and for the summaries of the game regulations of the British East African Protectorate and the German East African Protectorate , the book would have but little intrinsic value .

		The author does not give a connected story of his hunting expe - ditions , nor does he narrate many single adventures in following his sport .

		In brief , the volume is largely a note-book of observations on the various species of game , their habitat , appeaiance , size , color , habits , and head measurements , jotted down in the curtest and most uninteresting terms imaginable .

		Should any hunter of big game anticipate a sporting pilgrimage to
Africa	LOCATION	, however .

		Captain
Dickinson	PERSON	's book will offer him some additional information on the rarer kinds of game in the East African countiy .

		Mrs.
Mary Mead Clark	PERSON	, in her book entitled `` A Corner in
India	LOCATION	, '' tells of the missionary work of her husband and herself among the natives of the Nag ^ Hills in
Upper Burma	LOCATION	.

		They lived among those strange people in the high hills from
1868	DATE	to
1901	DATE	, at which time Mre .


Clark	PERSON	returned to her American home with Dr.
Clark	PERSON	, who later retui-ned to his cliarge .

		Such a long period of residence in that little-known corner of the world would naturally bring Mrs.
Clark	PERSON	into contact with many interesting stories of the home-life of the savages in
Burma	LOCATION	, of their life at work and at play , their worship and strange legends , their relationships with neighboring villages , and , above all , their slow acceptance of the Christian faith offered to them by the zealous mis - sionaries .

		All these divei ` sified stories Mrs.
Clark	PERSON	relates in a simple , unaffected , and pleasing style , and her book is consequently of interest both to the casual reader who likes to know about strange people in remote nooks of the world , and to those readers who are vitally concerned about the spread of the Christian religion .

		Unlike many books writ - ten by missionaries , this one is illustrated with good reproductions of excellent photographs .

0	DATE	/ Shaketpeare velopment of Sliakespeare as a a > a dramatitt .

		Dr-amatist '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a sane and well-considered attempt to set forth , somewhat more fully than has hitherto been attempted , the conditions that governed Shake8i -RRB- eare 's growth in the teclmique of dramatic ai ` t , and the problems which the gi-eat dramatist hatl to meet and solve in pursuing his high vocation of dramatic poet while at the same time satisfying the eager theatre-goers of his day .

		Professor
Baker	PERSON	's expeiience as an amateur stage-manager has been usefid to him in studying the details of the Elizabethan stage ; and his cliapter on this subject throws a good deal of light on a subject attended with many difficulties , but of gi-eater importance than students of Shake - speare 's art used to tliink .

		He rightly emphasizes the fact tliat the Elizabethans went to the theatre to see and hear a stori / told ; that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, therefore , as an ambitious playwright had to make it his cliief business to tell a good story well , and to meet the gradually shifting demands of a public which in a sense may be said to have been growing , like himself , though at a great distance , in dramatic taste ; and that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays must be judged by the standards of their day and not ours .

		Bearing these facts in mind , we shall worry less over the naming of plays like ' •
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' and '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' and in general sliall keep a point of view from which we shall l -RRB- e much better able to judge of Tudor dramatic effects and values .

		If the more subtle effects of dramatic situations are constantly dwelt upon and emphasized by Professor
Baker	PERSON	, we are not inclined to quari-el with him for this : for whUe it is doubtless true that
Sliake	PERSON	- speare could not have thought of them all while he was writing liis plays , still , who sliall say which of these effects he may not liave thought of and which he may not liave unconsciously , but instinctively and just as surely , prepared for ?

		It may be said that very few would feel all or any of these impressions ; but this is not the point .

		If any persons may be considered to have felt them , they are not negligible .

		The book tlirows more light on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's intel - lectual and ailastic development than many others wi-itten with less regard for external conditions and for the part other playwrights played in preparing the way for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations , repre - senting Elizabethan
London	LOCATION	and the theatres of that time , are most valuable .

		An , hoioi , ie.fo , - ^ he chief difficulty which confronts the stiidetit of the teacher of English literature is Engiiih poetry , ^ jj ^ j ^ f persuading his students to do enough reading to make profitable the use of the historical and critical manual with which they are provided .

		If they confine themselves to the text > book , their work remains fruitless as far as its real objects are concerned , and they get nothing more from it than a mass of facts and formulae of slight 214 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, educational value , most of which are speedily for - gotten .

		But the reading which they need is not easy to procure .

		Few of them have the books at home , and if they are sent to the school library , or to the public library , there may be fifty of them trying to get the same book at the same time .

		The exceptional student will doubtless contrive , in spite of all difficulties , to do a considerable amount of collateral reading , but the average student will give up the task as too onerous , and miss the main pur - pose of his study .

		Frankly , there seems to be no way out of the difficulty save by providing each student with an abundant supply of literature for his own private use .

		In the case of poetry , at least , this is not an in & uperable difficulty , for enough poetry can be got into a single volume to be worth while , and , if printed with due economy , the volume need be neither bulky nor expensive .

		Two volumes have recently come to us having precisely this object in view ; in other words , being intended to be small libraries of poetry in themselves .

		Professor
J. M. Manly	PERSON	's `` English Poetry , '' published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, gives us , in double-columned pages , something like fifty thousand lines of the best and most representative English poetry , ranging all the waj ' from the '' Ormulum '' to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		There are practically no notes , except a few of glossarial character , although there is a brief his - torical introduction to the collection .

		The poetical drama is necessarily excluded , but all other types are represented , and , except ui the case of a few very long poems , the examples are given complete .

		The other volume of whicli we now make mention is the '' English Poems , '' edited bj ' Professor
W. C. Bronson	PERSON	, and published at
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume , which extends to about twenty thousand lines , includes only poets of the nineteenth century , as the editor intends to prepare three other volumes for the earlier periods .

		Professor
Bronson	PERSON	also finds room for about a hundred pages of critical and bibliographical notes .

		These two works , pub - lished at a moderate price , should be warmly wel - comed as adjuncts to the work of teaching English literature in both colleges and secondary schools .

		Volume two of ^ he second volume of Bielschow - the definitive sky 's Life of Goethe -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , life of Goethe .

		translated by Professor
William A. Cooper	PERSON	of
Leland Stanford Junior University	ORGANIZATION	, has recently appeared .

		It covers the period from
Groethe	ORGANIZATION	's Italian journey to the War of Liberation , 1788-1815 , comprising the last two chapters of the first volume and the first twelve of the second of the German edition .

		Thick paper , clear pi-int , wide margins , and the other accessories that belong to the making of a fine book have been employed , as before , to make an imposing volume .

		It is , how - ever , almost a soiu-ce of regi'et that the publisliers have in this way increased the cost of the book .

		A thinner paper of equally good quality would have made it possible to retain the two volumes of the original .

		This would certainly have facilitated its use for frequent reference , and also it seems some - what out of proportion to make a translation not only cost practically the same per volume as the entire work in the original , but also to increase the number of volumes from two to three .

		The work was reviewed at some length in The Dial upon the appearance of the first volume of the translation .

		At that time its rank as the best and probably the definitive Goethe biography was recognized .

		It is therefore necessary to speak at this time only of the technical excellence of the translation .

		In general it seems that here there is a marked improvement ; it is very faithful and at the same time the English is usually free from the influence of the foreign idiom .

		Occasionally the rendering does not allow for the difference in the connotation of the same word in the two languages .

		Thus in speaking of the poet 's visit to a horse-fair to buy horses , Bielschowsky employed the somewhat pedantic expression that this belonged '' zur menschlichen Physiognomic des Olympiers . ''

		The thought is that the act in question was characteristic of the purely human phase of the poet 's exalted nature .

		Whatever may be said of the German , the literal rendering , '' to the human physiognomy of the Olympian , '' is practically mean - ingless .

		In speaking of '' Iphigenie auf Tauris '' also , the line concluding the great appeal of the priestess to the king , '' Verdirb uns -- wenn du darfst , '' is rendered , '' Destroy us -- if thou dare . ''

		This contradicts the very thought of a supreme ap - peal to '' moral principles . ''

		upon which the authoi ' is commenting .

		The verb dilrfen almost never means dare , and here , as the allusion to divine pro- tection shows , the meaning is , '' if thou mayest , '' or . ''

		if it is permitted thee . ''

		However , as already said , the translation is in general exceedingly good , and Professor
Cooper	PERSON	deserves the liearty thanks of the large number of admirers of Goethe , for whom reading the original would have been an appalling or an impossible task .

		* • If the unresponsive gods , so often Sar/on '' '' '' invoked , so seldom complaisant .

		would grant me one sweet boon , '' writes Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	in her introduction to the new edition of
James Howell	PERSON	's '' FamUiar Let - ters , '' '' I should ask of them that I might join that little band of authors , who , unknown to the wide careless world , remain from generation to genera - tion the friends of a few fortunate readers .

		These authors gi-ow very sliabby as the years roll by , and sometimes -- though rarely -- a sympathetic puli - lisher turns his attention from the whirling vortex of new books , and gives them a fresh outfit ; pre - sents them -- if he has a generous soul -- with the clearest of type , the finest of paper , the richest and most appropriate of bindings . ''

		It is this sort of '' new outfit '' that Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		have provided for the '' Familiar Letters . ''

		The edition is in two volumes , beautifully printed , and bound very simply in terra-cotta boards , with leather back and label , in a fashion to please the '' fortunate
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 few , '' of whom Miss R `` pplier speaks , -- who have long known and loved the • • Letters , '' and who will be glad to own them in so dignified and snitable a dress .

		Such persons need no introdnction to the '' Letters , '' whether critical or biographical ; indeed any bnt Miss Repplier 's they would find superfluous or even intrusive .

		But Miss Repplier 's introduc - tions are never superfluous : they re-kindle half - forgotten enthusiasms , suggest fresh points of view , flash light upon fugitive personalities , show old facts with new faces , -- put one .

		in short , in just the right mood for either the leLsurely enjoyment of an old friend or the delightful discovery - of a new one .

		Out of deference , perliaps .

		to 3Hiss Repplier 's well - known antipathy for tlie omnipresent note , the '' Letters '' have been left to speak for themselves , and surely no reader will pine for erudite guidance through the maze of curioas anecdote , lively narra - tive , and characteristically intimate comment and reflection which
Howell	PERSON	has constmcted , writing always crisply and lucidly , in accordance with his belief that a letter should be ' ^ shortrooated and closely coHch 'd '' and should '' not preach but episto - lire . ''

Denman W. Ross	PERSON	, who has devoted many years to it , during which he taught classes in composition of line , space , and color , at his home in

Harvard Universitj	ORGANIZATION	- .

		now sets forth in ' • A Theorj - of Pure Design '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the con - clusions at which he has arrived .

		The book has been long in preparation , and deserves more extended comment than can here be given it .

		It is '' a con - tribution to science rather than to art , '' thoi ; ^ h it should prove a manual of decided valae to designers who care to go into the raison d'etre of the effects for which they strive .

		Starting out with definitions of the orders of harmony , balance , and rhythm , pro- gress is by carefully ordered steps , each illustrated by diagrams , which , it is perhaps well to explain , are not to be considered as designs , their onlv func - tion being to elucidate the author 's meaning .

		It is not with designs , but with the basis of all design , that he deals .

		Great pains have been taken with the terminology , and everj - statement appears to have been weighed and tested with scrupolous care .

		The reasoning is clear and in most respects convinc - ing ; it would be entirely so but for a false note at the outset , in a definition of harmony which virtually makes it synonjTnoxis with unity and takes no note of the accordance of correlations .

		This at once raises the question whether the fundamental postulates upon which Dr. Roes founds his theory are suffi - Life of oit tra-rorer .

		ciently comprehensive .

		If his formola be aceepted , the square must be considered tiie most faarmooioas of all rectangular shapes .

		The omission of all eon - sideradon of proportion is , we think , a serious defect .

		Though Dr.
Ross	PERSON	's book is a notable contribution to the literature of testhedcs , the last word upon the subject Ls not yet said .

		Nevertheless , what he has written is worthy of most thoughtful consideration .

		As he aptly remarks , '' We must not believe that appreciation is easy ... The spontaneity of unde - veloped faculty does not count for mncJi .

		It carries us only a little way .

		Let no one believe that with - out study and practice in Design he can recognise and appreciate what is best in Design . ''

		That so picturesque a figure as Sir
John Hawkins	PERSON	should liave remained hitherto all bat neglected by bio - graphers is remarkable .

		Short accounts of him we do have in certain coUeeted biographies , such as
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's * • Lives of the British Admirals , '' and in ; the Transactions of the
Devonshire Association	ORGANIZATION	, as ' well a-s in
Froude	PERSON	's and other histories of

Hawkins	PERSON	, as contem - poraiy
State Papers	ORGANIZATION	and other evidence prove , was early in tlie field and made himself conspicuous there .

		As a young man he learned '' that negroes were very good merchandise in
Hispauiola	LOCATION	, and that they might easily be had upon the coast of
Guinea	LOCATION	. ''

		The author admits all this , but urges in defense that if his hero was not a humanitarian , he lived in an unhumanitarian age , and after all there were oUiers worse than `` he .

		• ' Every aeooont of him , '' he goes so far as to assert . '

		• makes
Hawkins	PERSON	a man of large heart and generous sympathies . ''

		Yet in ''
Purchas	PERSON	, his Pilgrimage , '' it is maintained by * • • R. M. '' -LRB- sup - posed to be .

		Sir
Robert ManseU	PERSON	-RRB- , who claims to have known
Hawkins	PERSON	personally , that `` he had malice with dissimulation , rudeness in behaviour , and was covetous in the last degree . ''

		However , a coldly impartial bi < ^ ; raphy would not kincQe the reader : and Mr.
Walling	PERSON	's book is a good , an interesting , and a ireful piece of work .

		Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	's volume on Shakespeare -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- fills , in the '' English Men of Letters '' series , a gap that has been allowed to stand for many years .

		Yet the delay ha.s been advantageous ; for Shaketpearr irnHNu rotuidrrnf .

		21G THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	and tlie rest of us have now outlived , let us hope , the period of cock-sure detailed accounts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life , in which eveiy hour of his earthly existence is accounted for and every line of his plays is confidently attributed to him or his collaborators or Bacon or someone else .

		Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	admits frankly and fearlessly that we do not and probably never shall know unich that it would be pleasant and desirable to know about Sliakespeare ; and then passes on to more important discussions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's reading , the theatre for which he wrote , and the stories and chai-acters and motives of the great plays .

		He is by no means indifferent to the philological problems still awaiting solution , and illustrates well the nature of these problems by remarks on `` The Taming of the Shrew , '' '' Timon , '' and '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' which latter he views as a political drama based on an earlier play which , a.s a love drama , had given place to '' Romeo and Juliet . ''

		Except the chronology of the plays , on which Professor
Raleigh	PERSON	says very little , there is scarcely an important topic of interpretation or criticism on which he does not manage to touch and to make some sufficiently comprehensive and illu - niinating remarks .

		The book may be characterized in short as a suggestive and stimulating discussion of the cliief mattei-s that should engage the attention of readers and students of the poet .

		The author apparently lias no illusions , and subscribes to no '' isms . ''

		He has jn ` oduced a thoroughly safe vol - ume on the subject of what everyone should know about Shakespeare .

		If he adds no important fact to our meagre store , if he adds no new theory to the bewildering maze already baffling the student , surely he does much in interpreting for us the times in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	moved and , perliaps as success - fully as most other writei-s , the mental life which the poet must have lived .

		And when we add that he writes not as a fetich-woi-shipper but as a reverent and honest student , we have said enough .

		It is a very human sort of a book '' ^ M : ^ rie .

		.

		i '' ^ vhich Mrs.
Gene Stratton-Porter	PERSON	has written '' What I Have Done with Birds '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill Company -RRB- .

		Meadows , thickets , swamps , and orchards , along the
Wabash	LOCATION	, have revealed theu - secrets to her persistent search , and she has succeeded in a truly remarkable way in making friends with the birds at their nests .

		The stories of her successful efforts to photogi'aph the parents , the nests , eggs , and young of the native birds , are quite as interesting sis are her excellent photographs .

		By dint of great patience , persistent care , and what she often modestly calls a lucky chance , she has induced many wild and shy birds , and not a few unusual ones , to pose before her camera , -- not only the robin , blue-jay , cow-bird , and barn-owl , but also the queen-rail , wood-thrush , black vulture , yellow-billed cuckoo , and the belted king - fisher .

		.

		She takes her readers frankly into her con - fidence , and they share her trials and vexations and soon come to feel the thrill of eager anticipation which attends each new venture in her sport .

		This thread of sustained interest I ` uns tlu-ough the whole book and makes it possible for the reader to over - look a perhaps justifiable pride of the author in her achievements and to ignore at times an abrupt style and a tendency to employ unusual words and phrases .

		The enthusiasm of her work is contagious and her love of the birds deserving of wide emulation .

		XOTES .

		THIS MONTH 'S MAGAZINES A Word to Librarians : Every librarian is constantly being asked questions like this about current periodicals : `` What new magazine is that article about in ? ''

		The only index that supplies this kind of information is WHAT 'S IN THE MAGAZINES .

		Your regular periodical index , un - equalled as it is for general refer - ence , is necessarily three or four weeks behind time .

		WHAT 'S IN THE MAGAZINES for
October	DATE	-LRB- for instance -RRB- comes out when the
October	DATE	magazines are being published .

		WHAT 'S IN THE MAGAZINES gives a classified index of the con - , tents of one hundred leading peri - odicals , grouped according to sub - ject and general character , and arranged alphabetically .

		Although complete and accurate , it is so simple in arrangement that the library patrons can use it as easily as the librarian .

		WHAT 'S IN THE MAGAZINES is very inexpensive --
fifty cents	MONEY	a year -- and every library should be a subscriber .

		If you are the li - brarian of a library with many magazine readers , you can readily see what an aid it will be to you .

		We should be glad to receive your subscription , or to send you a free sample copy upon request .

		BRIEFER MENTION 257 NOTES 2.57 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 258 A NEW DRA MATI C VENTURE .

		About twenty miles north of
Chicago	LOCATION	, on the shore of
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	, there is a place of recreation known as Ra \ ` inia Park .

		It is con - ducted , like many other amusement parks in the neighborhood of our larger cities , by one of those electric railway companies that link city and suburbs , and that find their accoimt in the enterprise le.ss in the gate receipts than in the increased profits from the transportation of passengers .

		With this fact the resemblance ends .

		The ordinary park established under such conditions is a place of garish lights and catch - penny devices , appealing frankly to vidgar tastes and empty intelligences , and wise in its generation with the wisdom that is at heart fooli.shness .

		Ravdnia Park makes no such appeal to the crowd .

		Chaste in its appointments , both as regards architecture and lajidscape garden - ing , refined in its atmosphere and a !

		\ l its asso - ciations , it embodies a standard of taste that makes it conspicuous among similar resorts , if not absolutely imique in its distinction .

		Its casino , its theatre , and its concert pavilion rep - resent about all that could be desired in com - fort and aesthetic satisfaction , and its sylvan shades offer a grateful retreat from the
summer	DATE	dust and heat of the city near at hand .

		Dui-ing the out-door seasons of the past three years , this park has offered concerts of good music , twice daily , given by two of the best orchestras in
America	LOCATION	.

		It has also been the scene of charming woodland performances of Shakespearian plays , and of a number of .

		special festivals .

		Even during the winter it is at times available , and many entertainments of a high character -- concerts , plays , and travel-lectures -- are given in the pretty theatre .

		Perhaps the most interesting experiment of which it has been the scene is that of the company of play - ers headed by Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	, who have recently completed a five weeks ' season of per - formances , and whose work has impelled us to the writing of the present article .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's enterprise has been long in preparation , and had nearly reached the point of disclosure a year ago , when the wind was cap - tured from its sails for a time by the ill-starred and mismanaged venture which took to itself the name of the
New Theatre	LOCATION	, had a meteoric exist - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ence of some four months , and then collapsed for lack of support .

		Its intentions were of the best , but a theatrical undertaking based upon good intentions alone is not likely to secure a footing anywhere in this commercial age and country .

		We recorded the demise of the
New Theatre	LOCATION
last winter	DATE	, and explained the reasons why its failure hatl been assured from the start .

		We also stated that the cause of the literary theatre in
Chicago	LOCATION	was by no means lost , and that another year would probably witness a new experiment upon more cautious lines and under raoi-e intelligent dii-ection .

		It is of this new experiment , which has already got fairly beyond the stage at which the faint praise conveyed in the words succes d'estime may be awarded , that we wish to say a few words .

		What Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	has done has been to collect a company of capable players , neither too old to learn nor too young to be responsive , to train them in accordance with his ideals -LRB- which are practical in the best sense -RRB- , and to impress upon their work his own sincerity and unifying intelligence .

		With their aid he has given per - formances of Moliere 's '' L ` Avare , '' Ibsen 's '' Kosmersholm , ''
Browning	PERSON	's '' A Blot in the ` Scutcheon , '' one of the early plays of
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	, and one of the lighter comedies of M. PaiUeron , -- performances for which fewer allowances have had to be made than one woidd have thought inevitable , considering all the diffi - culties attendant upon any new enterprise of their sort , performances that have proved more interesting and satisfying to those who take the di-ama seriously than any to be witnessed at the same time in the theatres of
Chicago	LOCATION	, well suj -RRB- - plied as those theatres have been with `` attrac - tions '' of the kind approved by the syndicate .

		The performances have not drawn large audi - ences , because the outing season was over when they began , and they have been given in a sparsely populated region .

		But they have attracted the right sort of attention in the right way , which is very much to the point .

		What is still more to the point is the fa `` t that the work is now transferred to one of the best of the
Chicago	LOCATION	theatres , there to be continued , on the scale of four afternoon performances a week , throughout the season .

		Its brief suburban history has revealed it as something too good to be spared , and even the tribe of newspaper critics , predisposed to scoff at anything that bears the reproach of being '' uplifting '' or the stigma of '' literary '' quality , has been compelled , if not exactly to pray , at least to treat the enter - prise with respectf id consideration .

		And so the plays that have won a deserved success on the boards of the sylvan theatre are now to be repeated in the heart of the city 's life , and are to be followed by others of their kind -- by mas - terpieces bearing the names of
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Strindberg	LOCATION	and
Giacosa	PERSON	and
Echegaray	PERSON	.

		These names , it need hardly be said , are the greatest among the dramatic writers of the present day .

		If their plays are too good for a public whose dramatic appetite is fed upon showy inanities , and whose applause means no more than the crackling of thorns under a pot , it must be so much the worse for the public .

		A theatre-man of the '' practical '' sort said to us , when Mr.
Robei-tson	PERSON	's preliminary announcement was made , '' Have you seen the list of the plays ? ''

		This query was intended to be the last word of scorn concerning so hopeless a px ` ogramme , and when we replied that it was the most interesting announcement we ha ^ l seen during a thirty years ' acquaintance with theatrical conditions in
Chicago	LOCATION	, we knew well enough that the reply woidd mean nothing to the querist .

		Here were the two points of view clearly defined , that of acquiescence in a commercialized theatre de - graded to the level of shallow entertainment , and that of faith in the -RSB- > ower of the drama to re - assert its lost dominion , and take its place once more among English-speaking people as one of the vital forms of creative litei-ature , as an effec - tive agency in the shaping of thought and conduct .

		If it be said that we are following after false gods in thus directing our chief attention to the translated drama , there is the obvious answer that the continental dramatists are the only ones now dealing seriously with the problems of modern life , and that they offer us the only available models .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, no doubt , and all the rest of those who share in his ideals , would be glad enough to produce serious mod - ern plays originally written in the English lan - guage , were such to be hatl .

		But the category is well-nigh non-existent , and all our hopes of re - constituting the lost literary species must depend upon our being made to realize , by foreign ex - ample , how far we have lapsed from the paths of dramatic virtue .

		When English playwrights begin to produce works that belong to literature as clearly as do those of the leatling dramatic craftsmen of
Europe	LOCATION	, then we may begin to cut loose from foreign teaching , although even then we should be unwise to forego altogether the benefits of the new international solidarity of social and ethical aim .

		It is because Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's experiment , which has now become
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 something more than an erperiment , has been attempted along what we can not but believe to be the right line of effort , that it has seemed to us to have a significance beyond its modest pretensions , and to deser \ - e the wide publicity of the present statement .

		WAGXER 'S FOLK-THEORY .

		In that vast medley of good sense , soond criti - cism , rhapsody , and rambling philosophy , the prose works of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, there is one idea which lifts itself again and again above the backs of its fellows , like the tenth wave upon the sea .

		It is his Folk-theory -- the proposition that all art , music , literature ,
spring	DATE	from the people ; that the articulate fashions itself out of the inarticulate , the defined out of the undefineil .

		as the clouds concentrate from the mist - The thought was .

		of course , not original with
Wagner	PERSON	.

		It is implicit in the Wolffian hj-pothesis about the Homeric poems .

		Herder fos - tered it by his investigations into and collections of popular literature .

		Hegel philosophized about it .

		It mav , indeed , be considered the leading contribu - tion of
Germany	LOCATION	to universal criticism , though
Lessing	PERSON	and Goethe were too wise to subscribe to the doctrine .

		And the idea has had a great run elsewhere .

		Ferguson , in his Historj - of
Archi	LOCATION	- tecture , applies it to that art .

		and describes how the cathedrals of
Europe	LOCATION	and the temples of
India	LOCATION	' • rose like exhalations '' from the spontaneous con - tributions of work and material by the people at large ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	carries the thought still further , and asserts that the common soldiers win all the victories of war .

		with little or no assistance from their gen - erals .

		In
America	LOCATION	, the '' man behind the gun '' has become a national faith .

		The true explication of the matter depends mainly on what we call the people .

		It is obvious that every - thing that is done must be done by somebody .

		Every piece of work must be the product of indi - vidual mind and hands .

		The people do not gather together in assembly to make a proverb .

		All the men and women of a country do not put their heads together to create a song or ballad .

		The cathedral or temple must have someone to inspire and plan its building -- someone to train and direct the work - man and look after the expense .

		The folk music must have originated at first in single minds , to be taken up and repeated by the masses .

		No matter how many the strong minds may be which inspire , orginate , create , direct the work of the world , they are few in number compared with the great multitudes of humanity .

		All arts , at least , are primarily arts of expression .

		And expression is the work of rare , sparsely scattered genius , or the result attained by trained and educated minds .

		The modem idea is that raciness and originality ' of thought , vividness and terseness of utterance , are to be found everywhere among the people .

		Back to natural humanity , we are told .

		The present writer can claim a pretty wide acquaintance among the ordinary every-day folk of the world -- seafaring I men .

		railroad laborers , lumbermen .

		Italians , Hon - i garians , Irish , Negroes , Brazilian and Bolivian peons .

		-- and he can testify that their intelligence and inspired wisdom are no great things .

		Good - ness , honesty , brave endurance , they have in plenty ; but they are mostiy dull and silent people .

		The only great artist in expression I can recall among laboring folk was a small searcaptain .

		His line was profanity ; and never have I known such pyro - technics of swearing -- the oaths darting npward like a rocket and bursting into myriads of corros - cating sparks .

		It is true that when we go among unfamiliar people we are often struck by daring singularities of thought or speech .

		-- but if we inquire into the matter we wfll find that these fehciries are common propertj - , have been handed down from time immemorial , and were probably invented by a few forgotten geniuses .

		Owing to their permitted unconventionality .

		their imposed necessities , the poor do express themselves in char - acter -- in variations of dress , habit , surroundings , and action -- more than the well-to-do : hence their hmnor of contrasts and their picturesqueness .

		which artists of all kinds seize upon and exploit .

		As for the well-to-do -- the middle classes -- no creation of any kind can be expected of them as a body .

		Self - sacrifice , devotion , the fanaticism of the idea , the scorn of comfort and consequence , -- these are the qtialities of originating minds , and they are not to be looked for among those who wish to get on or keep up in the world .

		The leader or the multitude -- which does the important work of the world ?

		As to which does the necessary work -- the sowii ^ and rea | Mng of harvests , the building of houses and roads , the trans - action of life 's daily business , -- there is .

		of course , no question .

		But this is the hand-to-mouth part of existence , and adds little of permanent value to the world .

		And even here it is the inspired few who discover and train the processes of nature , and invent the mechanical and labor-saving devices .

		But the things superimposed upon mere animal life -- relig - ions , literatures , arts , and sciences , -- these are the work of an immeasurably small minority of man - kind , the pioneers and pilots who go sounding on their dim and perilous way ahead of humanity .

		It may be urged that genius of every sort draws on the common experience and thought of mankind , that the race or nation pours into the poet or artist or inventor the ideas which he gives back to them in completed work , I confess I do not see how the transfusion of brains or blood from the many to the one is accomplished ; and there are too many instances of great men holding themselves solitary and aloof from the crowd , in whose minds have surged all the thoughts and imaginations of the world , to make the theory believable .

		Of course , such men have their progenitors in the past : they belong to a brotherhood of talent which stretches 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, down from the beginning of time .

		When we say , for instance , that
Burns	PERSON	's songs
spring	DATE	from the people , we merely mean that he had a dozen or score of predecessors whose half-forgotten work fur - nished him hints and help .

		Of course the creator , when he conies , has to use the material he finds at hand to build with .

		A poet has to use the language of his race , which is itself a gi'aveyard of dead poets and thinkers ; he has to look abroad and use the men and women he knows as models .

		But he has in his own mind and heart the thoughts and pas - sions -- the hopes , desires , loves , hatreds , doubts , and scorns -- which he is to express .

		What I wish to emphasize is the distinctive quality of genius and its comparative rarity .

		Someone has said that all the persons who have really moved or improved the world might be gathered into a not over-large hall .

		And the secondary talents -- the popularizers , the propa - gators and imitators of others ' ideas -- are not such a mighty multitude .

		The vast bulk of mankind is taken up with getting its living , and has little time for things of the mind .

		The most popular poet or musician or artist has a comparatively small audi - ence .

		Only religious ideas have the power to spread wide and penetrate deep into the human mind .

		A man may enjoy life without the poet , but he fears to face death without the priest .

		The best way in which the people can cooperate with the creator is by receptivity -- the readiness to applaud and reward the man who can originate .

		In some measure , the genius and the public are like the flint and the steel -- they must conspire to pro- duce a blaze .

		Sometimes the receptivity is present ; but the genius does not come .

		The Chinese have throughout their history exhibited a marvellous will - ingness to be led and taught ; they have made the reward of learning , the search for literary ability , almost the sole business of the state ; but so far as we know , literary ability has refused to develop .

		More often the man of genius arises , but his state or people are not ready to recognize him .

		But when these two conditions combine , we get the spontaneous outbursts of art which star the march of man .

		In full perfection , there are hardly more than three of the outbursts to be counted .

		One was that bloom aud efflorescence of beauty and grandeur at
Athens	LOCATION	after the Persian war .

		Inflamed with patriotism , the Athenians poured the spoils of that victory at the feet of architects and sculptors , and encouraged the poets to record the greatness of their race in a marvellous series of dramas .

		The second period of prodigious growth was in
Italy	LOCATION	when paint - ing and poetry were called into being by religious requirements -- by the revival of learning , and by the new joy of life .

		The third harvest was in
Elizabethan England	LOCATION	, when our race , freed from religious despotism , freed from the fear of foreign domination , demanded the most joyous and profound drama the world has known as an expression of its energy and adventurous spirit .

		A simulacrum of such prodigalities of artistic life has often been brought about by the action of princes or rulers ; their patronage being an artificial stim - ulation to a soil which would otherwise have been barren , or productive of only stunted crops .

		In such cases the people had little to say about the matter .

		No doubt the Roman senators and captains wondered what
Augustus	PERSON	could see in
Virgil	LOCATION	and
Horace	PERSON	and
Ovid	LOCATION	.

		These poets certainly did not get their encouragement from popular appreciation .

		It was a little better in the capital of
Louis XIV.	LOCATION	, for the public did flock to the theatre .

		But the power of the court gave the stamp of authority to CorneiUe ,
Racine	LOCATION	, and Molifere , rather than to their mediocre rivals .

		And it was the strong hand of the King which probably saved Moliere from being hanged by the priests or murdered by the mar - quises .

		The citizens of
Saxe	PERSON	-
Weimar	LOCATION	absolutely fought against the glory which was to crown them .

		They thought Goethe an interloper , and
Schiller	PERSON	no better than he ought to be ; but
Karl August	PERSON	persisted in his patronage , and gave
Germany	LOCATION	its classic literature .

		The subjects of
Ludwig	ORGANIZATION	rose in rebellion against
Wagner	PERSON	, and compelled the aban - donment of projects which , when finally carried out , brought so much honor to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In general , all such art commanded from above lacks the breadth and natural force of the sponta - neous creations .

		For one thing , while a prince can give an artist leisure and opportunity , he necessarily and unconsciously deprives him of liberty .

		And the greatest art can not dance in fetters .

		When literature descends to the day of dedications and adulation of private patrons , it breathes hard indeed , and finally gives up the ghost .

		One remarkable recent instance there is of a lit - erature almost made by the state , but made without any conditions of service or servility being imposed upon the recipients of the government help .

		For nearly a hundred years ,
Norway	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	have pursued a steady course of patronage to able men .

		They wanted a literature , and were willing to pay for it .

		They are , or were , poor countries , of no gi'eat importance on the map of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They had no reading public to reward authors , --
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	records that he received eighteen doUars for the copyright of his first long novel , -- but by exercise of wonderful discrimination the governments succeeded in selecting their best men , not after they had become famous , but when they were practically unknown , and by giving them pensions and travelling grants kept them alive until their work lifted the Scandinavian countries to a literary equality with any modern state .

		Oehlenschlager ,
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	,
Andersen	LOCATION	, in
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Ibsen	PERSON	and
BjOrnson	PERSON	in
Norway	LOCATION	, to name only a few of the most eminent , were thus tided over their difficulties and encouraged to create .

		In reading
Andersen	PERSON	's autobiography , or
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's letters , one is struck indeed by the pitiful smallness of the sums they received .

		But it was enough .

		It was given when tliey needed
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 it , and it was given without any conditions .

		Often indeed one or another of these authors was in practical rebellion against the authorities who were feeding him , and was fearfully unpopular among the people who paid the taxes .

		It is almost axiomatic that a man of genius must be in rebellion against his time .

		It is axiomatic , too , that the new prophet shall be killed with the weapons of the old one .

		Imagine the
English Government	ORGANIZATION	and the Church of
England	LOCATION	giving
Darwin	PERSON	a grant to pursue investigations which were to undermine religion I Imagine the French authorities helping the Barbizon school of painters to prove that previous French art was false I Yet this is very much what the Norwegian state did in aiding Ibsen to pen his satires on politics and society .

		A more intelligent patronage of literature was pro- bably never practiced .

		There has been nothing like it in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	.

		That part of the English Civil List which goes to reward men of letters or artists of any kind is so small , at least in comparison with other pensions , as to encourage contempt for such professions in the public mind .

		And the gifts are usually made after the recipient 's working time is over .

		In
America	LOCATION	not even this much has been done .

		So far as I know , there has never been a dollar paid to any American writer or artist by way of grant or pension .

		Pictures and statues have of course been ordered by the government ; but this has been a matter of bargain .

		And positions in the diplomatic or consular service have been conferred upon men of letters .

		But the positions had to be given to somebody , and it is to be presumed that a due return of work has been made for the salaries .

		Such positions might keep men of genius alive , but they would hardly quicken their intellects or secure them time for the production of great works .

		This is merely a statement of facts , and not a complaint .

		Indeed , under our system of life and government , it is probably best to leave things as they are .

		Whom could we trust to discriminate in the granting of state aid ?

		If a thousand pensions were granted to-morrow for the encouragement of art and literature and science , it is prettj - certain that they wovdd go in the main to the mediocres , and that the men of genius would be left with an additional mortification .

		To return to the main theme , it seems to me a misuse of terms to say that literature and art
spring	DATE	from the f > eople , when , save in rare and special epochs , they have to be forced down the people 's throat , either by the self-sacrifice and energj * of their producers , or by the authority of king or gfovemnient .

		In every age there is a commercial kind of literature and art , insipid , tawdrj - , foolish , which the people demand and are willing to pay for .

		But almost always the new , the great , the significant art descends on them from above , and they hate it , and do aU they can to destroy its creators .

		CASUAL comment : LiBRAKY-scHOOL EXTEX8IOX , like
University	ORGANIZATION	exten - sion , strives to make good , so far as possible , the lack of strict and regular training in early life .

		This latest educational extension movement is now somewhat of an old story in the library world , but the good and system - atic work done by the
New Jersey Library Class	ORGANIZATION	, under the auspices of the
Newark Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, has a certain freshness of interest as set forth in the pages of a small pamphlet just published by the class .

		In
October , 1904	DATE	, a circular was issued by the
Newark	LOCATION	library proposing that the library assistants of the near vicinity , or such of them as were not library-school graduates , should club together , engage a good teacher , and take a course of lessons in some branch of library economy .

		Thirty-three responded to the call , and
Miss Josephine Rathbone	PERSON	, of the
Pratt Library School	ORGANIZATION	, was ' secured for a series of ten lessons in reference work , the class meeting on
Monday	DATE
mornings	TIME	for two hoars at the
Newark	LOCATION	library and paying a fee of
twenty-five cents	MONEY	for each member .

		An informal quiz at the end of each lesson , sometimes an assignment of home work , and an optional examination at the end of the course , served to give variety and completeness to the instruction and to keep alive the interest of the pupils .

		Similar courses have followed in the succeeding years , and seventy persons have profited by one or more of them .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	and
Miss Winser	PERSON	, of the

		A pleasantly chatty article on field-mice , chipmunks , and other '' small country neighbors , '' enlivens the opening pages of the current '' Scribner , '' while sundry much - quoted utterances on '' Nature Fakers , '' and an excursion into the field of Irish mythology , and a brief apprecia - tion of

		Yet , curiously enough , it is only a year and a half ago that the student editors of a Utile magazine issued monthly from the

Loeb	PERSON	announcing that '' the President hereafter will not write for publication during his incumbency of his present ofBce except on matters of public interest and in an ofiicial way . ''

		It is interesting , then , to bear in mind , while reading the '' Century '' article on Irish Sagas , or the `` Scribner '' paper on squirrels and woodpeckers , that the subjects discussed are `` matters of public in - terest , '' and are treated '' in an official way . ''

		• • • Thrift uf libr .

		\ ry admlxistration is illustrated by some striking statistics printed in the 27th annual report of the public library of
Peoria	LOCATION	, 111 .

		In a table showing the number of books circulated yearly per 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, attendant , we find that whereas
Louisville	LOCATION	circulates 2248 ,
Boston	LOCATION	4348 ,
Chicago	LOCATION	8351 , and
Los Angeles	LOCATION	14,738 , the thrifty town on the
Illinois	LOCATION	river gets its books into use at the rate of 23,717 per annum for each attendant employed .

		Another interesting question is .

		How long does it take to issue any book called for ?

		The average time in
Boston	LOCATION	, according to a late report , is ten minutes , as Librarian
Willcox	PERSON	-LRB- of
Peoria	LOCATION	-RRB- informs us ; and he continues , referring to his own library : '' The average of three trial tests made by us on
Saturdays	DATE	at our busiest hom-s , was 307 books in 101 minutes , or a trifle more than tliree a minute . ''

		But that is ambigu - ous .

		One might stand at the delivery desk in
Boston	LOCATION	of a
Saturday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	and watch the stream of books flowing over the counter in an uninterrupted current , and possibly one would find that even more than 307 were sometimes issued in the space of one hour and forty-one minutes .

		The real point is , how long before the passage of the first book noted in this continuous stream was this particular volume applied for ?

		How - ever , we do not doubt the nimbleness of the
Peoria	LOCATION	attendants .

		On the subject of open shelves , Mr.
Willcox	PERSON	feels a little disheartened .

		Even with a limited appli - cation of the system , he has to report an average loss of ninety-nine volumes a year for the last three years .

		But he appears to comfort himself a little with the assurance that other libraries are sufl : ering larger losses than his ; for he prints
Boston	LOCATION	's shameful record of
1693	DATE	volumes stolen in one year , the
Providence	LOCATION	loss of
1796	DATE	, and the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	record-breaking total of 4044 a year for two years .

		What is the public con - science coming to ?

		The situation seems to call for something like a grand mass-meeting of protest and reform , or a thorongh and simultaneous ventilating of the whole disagreeable busmess in the public press .

		Who will point out the effective remedy -- short of a return to chains and padlocks for library books ?

Shelley	PERSON	's letters to Miss Hitchener , sparingly quoted from by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	m liis life of the poet , were last year added to the manuscript treasiu'es of the British Museum , which in the same year became the richer by one hundred and fifty-eight published works or editions previously unknown to bibliographers .

		Con - cerning the correspondence between
Shelley	PERSON	and
Miss Hitchener	PERSON	, it appears to bear witness to a friendship as violent as it was brief .

		The lady kept a school at Hurstpierpoint in
Sussex	LOCATION	, and became favorably known to the poet in his early republican days because of her advanced opinions in politics and religion .

		So enthu - siastic did he become in his admiration for her that he not only sent her a boxful of his revolutionary pam - phlets , which nearly got him into trouble with the custom-house officers at
Holyhead	LOCATION	, but he also insisted on her joining his household soon after his unhappy marriage with
Harriet Westbrook	PERSON	.

		At first regarded by the Shelleys as a second
Portia	LOCATION	, and so named by them , the gifted lady soon found herself less passion - ately admired ; in fact , the '' Portia '' gave place to '' the Brown Demon , '' and thus the friendsliip came to an end .

		The lesson of this characteristic episode , those who run may read .

		... Spenser , the poets ' poet , has been made in some measure the children 's poet as well , in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, where the Story Hour conducted by the
Free Library	ORGANIZATION	has pleasantly familiarized many boys and girls with the legends of the `` Faerie Queene . ''

		Mr.
John Thomson	PERSON	, the librariani says in his Eleventh Annual Report : '' It is still necessary in some sections of the city to issue tickets limiting the number of the children to the capacity of the rooms used for the purpose -LSB- of the Story Hour -RSB- and to avoid overcrowding and its consequent disorder .

		Seventeen members of the Free Library staff have taken part in the programmes this
winter	DATE	.

		They have devoted time outside of their regular hours to serious study in preparing the stories , and have entered into the work with that hearty enthu - siasm which ensures success .

		The programme of the year has contained some very popular features .

		Four well-chosen stories from
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's ' Faerie Queene ' have led to the reading of the simpler editions of the English Classsics , and ' Una and the Lion , ' ' St. George and the
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' Britomart and
Florimel	PERSON	' have become well known to hundreds of children . ''

		This is an encourag - ing report .

		We need not despair of the republic so long as its schoolchildren take delight in Spenser .

		One is reminded incidentally of Pope 's boyish fondness for the '' Faerie Queene '' more than two centuries ago . ''

		There is something in Spenser , '' he declared in later life , '' which pleases one as strongly in one 's old age as it did in one 's youth .

		I read the '
Faerie Queene	PERSON	' when I was about twelve with a vast deal of delight , and I think it gave me as much when I read it over a year or two ago . ''

		... The old-fashioned way of writing history , the way of
Rollins	PERSON	and
Robertson	PERSON	and
Hume	PERSON	and
Gibbon	PERSON	, is evidently the way chosen by Dr.
Emil Reich	PERSON	in the appalling task he is now engaged upon , the writing of a ''
General History of Western Nations	ORGANIZATION	from
5000	DATE	B.C. to
1900	DATE	A.D. '' A histoi-iographer of the modern school , spending more time in the recording of events than those events themselves occupied , woidd need a score or more of Methuselah-lives to do full justice to such an under - taking .

		But the fluent and versatile author of '' Success in Life '' and ''
Germany	LOCATION	's Swelled Head '' shows no signs of flinching .

		Emulating the doers of large tilings in literature and learning , he heroically enters upon his self-appointed task . ''

		I attempt to do for the history of the Western nations , '' he declares , '' what
Bichat	LOCATION	did for Anatomy ,
Bopp	PERSON	and
Pott	PERSON	for Linguistics , or Savigiiy for Roman Law .

		I try to write the ' General Part ' of history . ''

		And then he explains that '' at the basis of all that happened in the history of VV ^ estern nations there is a series of some twenty to thirty general facts , which singly , and still more by meeting , blending , or antago - nizing one another , created a multitude of particular facts .

		The present work treats mainly of these general facts , each of which has conditions , details , and effects of its own . ''

		History has as many meanings , and is capable of being told in as many ways , as there are historians , not to say readers ; and that is I ` eason enough for Dr.
Reich	PERSON	's re-telling of the old story .

		May Clio smile upon him !

		... What
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries ate and DRANK is not without interest to his present-day readers .

		The Elizabethans , as one might imagine , were not exactly delicate feasters languidly toying with half - tasted dainties .

		There has just been made public a letter from the
Earl of Leicester	ORGANIZATION	to Lord
Burleigh	PERSON	wherein is found an amusing reference to the virgin queen 's love of malt liquor , and her insistence upon having it good and strong . ''

		There is not one drop of good drink for her here , '' writes the Earl from

		That was an age that knew not breakfast food ; no pre-digested , concentrated , brain-biiilding preparation of crumpled crumbs or crinkled com figured on the
morning	TIME	table of sixteenth-century
England	LOCATION	.

		Bread and ale were the staples on which they breakfasted , or at least these appear to have been the chief items of the queen 's morn - ing meal .

		In her father 's reign , we are told , the maids of honor were allowed for breakfast one loaf , one manchet , two gallons of ale , and a pitcher of wine .

		Of a certain Lady Lucy it is wi-itten that she daily broke her fast upon a chine of beef , a loaf , and a gallon of ale , while for her pillow meal she was served with a posset porridge , a goodly slice of mutton , a loaf , and a gallon of ale .

		XovEL-NOTKS OF AN '' OLD FOGY , '' as he calls him - self , suggest a few comments .

		Dr.
William Everett	PERSON	, in a newspaper article on '' An ' Old Fogy 's ' Novel Reading , '' calls us back to the re-perusal of some of the imperishable masterpieces -- and also to some whose imperishability is not so free from doubt .

		His praise of
Scott	LOCATION	, glowing though it is , is not excessive .

		What appreciative reader of the Waverleys will ever tire of hearuig or uttering eulogies on their author ?

		Has it ever been noted , by the way , how almost invariably a true lover of Shakespeare proves to be also a loyal admirer of Scott ?

		From the more immediately and perhaps irresistibly appealing ephemeralities of the cur - rent '' best sellers , '' what a satisfaction to turn back and solace oneself with the everlasting humanities of those two immortals !

		They impart a sense of security and permanence that fails us in the bewildering variety and copiousness of twentieth-century fiction .

		Among other old authors lauded by Dr.
Everett	PERSON	are
Miss Austen	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	,
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	,
Samuel Lover	PERSON	,
Bulwer Lytton	LOCATION	,
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		But the faults , the obvious faidts , of Lover and
Bulwer	PERSON	must tell more and more heavily against them , while even
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	will hardly succeed again in creating such a delirium of delight as that described by Dr.
Everett	PERSON	.

		... English stage cen80r.ship , with its amusing and frequently irritating absurdities and inconsistencies , may possibly undergo a long-desired reform before the cen - tury is much older .

		This at least is the hope of Mr.
Edward Gamett	PERSON	-LRB- son of Dr.
Richard Gamett	PERSON	-RRB- whose play , '' The Breaking Point , '' was recently rejected by the official censor as unfit for presentation .

		The author now makes an appeal to the public by printing his play and offering as literature what he was forbidden to present as acted drama .

		Should his readers take sides with him and regard the suppression as imwarranted , their moi-al support , added to a long accumulation of indignant protests in the past , might lead to an over - turning of the old order -- reluctant though the old order is to change in conservative
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Meanwhile whatever the injured playwright may have lost in tem - per should be more than made up to him in pounds , shillings , and pence ; for what could more strongly appeal to a reader 's curiosity -- and , what is more im - portant , to a book-buyer 's purse -- than a suppressed play ?

		... The secret of Sully-Prudhomme 's fame , the rea - son of the haunting charm of some of his lines , is to be sought in a hopeless passion that swept him off his feet and carried him some distance up the slope of
Parnassus	LOCATION	when he was already thirty years old and his character too maturely developed to admit of recovery from his disappointment . ''

		She '' married another , and he wrote '' Les Vaines Tendresses . ''

		It is said that certain exqui - site fragments of his poems , notably the simple line from '' Le Vase Bris ^ , '' -- ' ■ N ' y tonchez pas .

		il est bria ^ , '' -- have not only become classic as literature , but have entered into the language and been adopted as proverbs .

		Again , it seems , we have illustrated in this poet , whose recent death turns our eyes upon him if only for a passing moment , the old truth that whatever man achieves of great and worthy and lasting is paid for out of his very heart 's blood ; that only he who can spend himself , who will give his life , shall win immor - tality ... Shakespeare the all-sufficing was a whole lib - rary to the late
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, who in girlhood was all but forbidden by her father to read any book except the Bible . ''

		Kavanagh , '' however , was smuggled into the house , and also
Lydia Maria Child	PERSON	's '' I. `` tters from
New York	LOCATION	'' ; or , rather , the latter found refuge in a box beside the doorstep , the former safely running the block - ade and getting itself hidden under the piano .

		After reading ''
Kavanagh	PERSON	, '' says Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, '' Emily thought in ecsta.sy , ' This then is a book , and there are more of them ! ' ''

		Losing , temporarily , the use of her eyes , it was a comfort to her to think that there were so few real books that she could easily find someone to read them all to her .

		But when , Liter , she so far recovered her eyesight as to read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, she said to herself , '' Why is any other book needed ? ''

		Per - haps the secret of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's originality , of her never reminding her readers of anyone but herself , is to be found in that meagreness of literary fare that early forced her to rely on her own resources of imagination and conjecture and high thinking .

		What would have been intellectual starvation to most others was intellec - tual stimulation to her .

		The reading of prisoners , which has lately been brought into notice and made a subject of discussion through the report of the librarian at

		A VETERAN 'S Memories of War AND Peace .

		* Retired from the army service nearly thirteen years ago , Gen.
Oliver Otis Howard	PERSON	has since been occupied in educational and literary pur - suits , especially in furthering the fortunes of various schools for colored youth , such as
Howard University	ORGANIZATION	,
Atlanta University	ORGANIZATION	, Lincoln Memo - rial
University	ORGANIZATION	, and many others , and in pre - paring for publication the rich reminiscences of a long and active and variously useful life .

		Born in
1830	DATE	at
Leeds	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, the descendant of generations of
New England Howards	ORGANIZATION	and Otises , he feels a pardonable satisfaction in the favorable circumstances of his origin and up - bringing , and may well have been fired from the first with an ardent ambition to do something to enhance , in his own person , the fair fame of his lineage .

		Farm work and country schooling contributed to the shaping of body and mind , until he began his preparation for coUege at the Hallo well high school -- of whose excellent cur - riculum at a somewhat later date Mrs.
Martha Baker Dunn	PERSON	has written entertainingly in her ''
Cicero	PERSON	in
Maine	LOCATION	. ''

		Entering Bowdoin at the early age of fifteen , the energetic la < l was gradu - ated in
1850	DATE	, in the same class with Senator
Frye	PERSON	and the late
Charles CarroU Everett	PERSON	, Dean of the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	, whom an odd trick of the memory makes him call
Carroll S. Everett	PERSON	.

		In college at the same time also was ''
Mell '' Fuller	PERSON	, the present
Chief Justice of our Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		From Bowdoin young
Howard	PERSON	proceeded , in consequence of an unexpected vacancy , to the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	at
West Point	LOCATION	, where he led his class at the end of the first year and ranked fourth at the end of his course .

		Choosing the ordnance department , he served first at the Watervliet Arsenal , then as Chief of Ordnance in the
Seminole	LOCATION	campaign in
Florida	LOCATION	, and was then appointed instructor in mathematics at
West Point	LOCATION	, whence at the outbreak of the Civil War he hastened home to assume com - mand of the
Third Maine Regiment	ORGANIZATION	; and from that time onward his movements become a part of our national history .

		Rising from colonel to major-general , from the command of a regiment to that of an army corps , he took part in forty - seven important engagements , the most note - worthy of which was the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, • Autobiography of
Oliver Otis Howard	PERSON	.


Major-Oeneral U.S.A.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		where he commanded the left wing of the Federal forces .

		Subsequently transferred to the West , he saw a good deal of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	and
Sherman	PERSON	, and has recorded his impressions of those two generals , with the latter of whom he had abundant opportmiity to become well acquainted in the course of the
Atlanta	LOCATION	cam - paign and the march to the sea .

		Of
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	's services as Commissioner of the Freedmen 's Bureau much could be said ; but our remaining space can better be given to illustra - tive extracts from the book itself .

		A passage from his West Point life -- from his experience as teacher there -- shows him to have been even then a man of larger interests , of a more serious and scholarly turn of mind , than the ordinary army officer . ''

		I took up the Hebrew language and recited with some regularity to an p -RSB- piscopal clergyman near High - land Falls .

		He was a scholarly man and interested himself greatly in my progress .

		Lectures , in connection with Bible study , I delivered habitually once a week in what we called ' the little church under the hill . '

		This church where the soldiers ' families attended was so arranged that a partition separated the altar and all that belonged to it from the main room .

		This enabled the Catholics to have their services in the
morning	TIME	, when the partition doors were opened , and the other people in the
afternoon and evening	TIME	, when the doors were closed .

		Here we had , every Sabbath for nearly four years , a thriving
Sunday	DATE	school , of which I was the superintendent .

		In this active Christian work , cadets , the chaplain 's daughters , and other ladies of the post assisted regularly with the music and as teachers .

		Usually in the evening we had a Methodist clergyman to preach and conduct the services .

		Sometimes our chap - lain , who was an Episcopalian , would give an address , and sometimes the clergy of other denominations . ''

		I always endeavored to do something in addition to what my military duties proper and the preparation for them required .

		It may be said that this was not a fair preparation for what might be required of me sooner or later m the army proper ; but I do not think so .

		This training to which I subjected myself enlarged my sympa - thies and acquaintanceship , and was , indeed , a stepping - stone to all that followed . ''

		It was through
Blaine	PERSON	's friendly offices that the command of the
Maine	LOCATION	regiment was obtained for the young West Point graduate , Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	being then Speaker of the state
House of Rep	ORGANIZATION	- resentatives .

		A picture of the budding states - man is thus drawn : '' One coiUd hardly find a more striking character .

		His figure was good -- nearly six feet and well propor - tioned ; his hair , wliat you could see of it under his soft hat pushed far back , was a darkish brown .

		It showed the disorder due to sundry thrusts of the flugers .

		His coat , a little long , was partially buttoned .

		This , with the collar , shirt front , and necktie , had the negligee air of a di-ess never thought of after the first adjustment .

		His head was a model in size and shape , with a forehead high and broad , and he had , as you would anticipate in
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 m. Btroag fmee , a large nose .

		Bnt the distingnishing feature of his face was that pair of dark-gray eyes , very full and bright .

		He wore no beard , had a slight lisp in ^ > eech , with a clear , penetrating , nasal tone .

		He excelled even the nervous Washbnm in rapid utterance .

		Nobody in the
Maine House of Bepresentatives	LOCATION	, where he had been for two years and of which he was now the Speaker , could match him in debate .

		He was , as an opponent , sharp , fearless , aggressive , and uncompromis - ing ; he always had given in wordy conflicts , as village editor and as debater in pnUic assemblies , blow for Mow with ever-increasing momentom .

		Yet from his consummate management he had already become pop - ular .

		Such was
Blaine	PERSON	at thirty years of age . ''

		Instead of quoting any harrowing descrip - tions of battle and bloodshed , let us cite the author 's reflections upon the lesson of such scenes in military - history .

		In his detailed and interesting account of the battle of
Grettysburg	LOCATION	, he writes : '' It is sometimes said to me that writing and speak - ing upon the events of the war may have a deleterious influence upon youth .

		I can conceive of two reasons for such a warning -- one , that a soldier by his enthu - siasm may , even unconsciously , infuse into his writing and speech the war spirit , and thus incite strong desires in younger minds for similar excitements and deeds ; and , secondly , a soldier deeply affected as he must have been in our great struggle for national existence , may not take sufficient pains in his accounts of historic inci - dents to allay any spirit of animoaty or dissension which may still exist . ''

		But with regard to the first , I think there is need of a faithful portraiture of what we may call the after - battle , a panorama which shows with fidelity the fields covered with dead men and horses : with the wounded , numerous and helpless , stretched on the ground in masses , each waiting his torn ; the rough hospitals with hay and straw for bedding , saturated with blood and wet with the rain ; houses torn into fragments ; every species of property ruthlessly demolished or deatroyed -- these , which we can not well exaggerate , and such as these , cry out against the horrors , the hate - ful ravages , and the countless expense of war .

		They show plainly to our children that war , with its embodied woes and fnries , must be avoided , except as the last appeal for existence , or for the rights which are more valuable than life itselL '' The author dates his more intimate acquaint - ance with
Sherman	PERSON	from the
evening	TIME	of
Nov.	DATE	.

		14 .

		1863 , when
Grant	ORGANIZATION	and
Sherman	PERSON	had an interview at
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, at which the writer himself was present . ''

		My real acquaintance with
Sherman	PERSON	began that evening .

		It was a privilege to see these two men .

		Grant and
Sherman	PERSON	, together .

		Their unusual friend - ship -- unusual in men who would naturally be rivals -- was like that of
David	PERSON	and .

		Jonathan .

		It was always evident , and did not grow from likeness , but from nnlikeness .

		They appeared rather the complements of each other -- where the one was especially strong , the other was less so , and rice rena .

		It was a marriage of characters , in sympathy , by the adjustment of dif - ferences .

		`` Grant in oommand was , as everybody then said .

		habitoally reticent .

		Sherman was never so .

		Grant meditated on the situation , withholding his opinion until his plan was well matured .

		Sherman quickly , brilliantly , gave you half a dozen .

		Grant , once speaking of Sherman in cadet phiaae , said : '' He bones all the time while he is awake ; as much on horseback as in camp or at his quarters . ''

		It was true .

		Sherman had remarkable topographical abUity .

		A country that he once saw he could not forget .

		The cities , the villages , the streams , the mountains , hills , and divides -- these were as easily seen by him as human faces , and the features were always on hand for use .

		It made him ever playing at draughts with his adversary .

		Let the enemy move and
Sherman	PERSON	's move was instant and well chosen . ''

		Grant appeared more inclined to systematixe and simplify ; bring up sufficient force to outnumber ; do uneijjected things ; take promptly the offensive ; follow up a victory .

		It was a simple , straightforward calco - lus , which avoided too much complication .

		It made Grant the man for campaign and battle .

		Sherman was always at his best in campaign -- in general maneuvers -- better than in actual battle .

		His great knowledge of I history , his tc ^ wgraphical scope , his intense suggestive I faculties seemed often to be impaired by the actual conflict .

		And the reason is plain ; such a mind and body as his , full of impulse , full of fire , are more likely to be perturbed by excitement than is the more iion - boimd constitution of a Grant or a Thomas . ''

		Gen.
Howard	PERSON	's work in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	among the Indians , at
West Point	LOCATION	as Superintendent of the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and in numerous other fields of labor , must be passed by without even a brief word of appreciative mention .

		The whole story , fully but modestly told , will be found in his book .

		He takes the reader delightfully into his confidence , and writes with an astonishing recollection of detail .

		An autobiography at once so full of incident and so free from matters of small importance has rarely been produced .

		From first to last there is a sense of reality , of human significance , in the two ample volumes .

		Their clear print and typographical correctness will recommend them to failing eyes and to readers impatient of compositors ' blunders .

		246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, I ` histoire de Chine and his
Essai Hur Vhistoire	PERSON	du Japon have been so well received that they are now out of print .

		His studies in Japanese literature are interesting and valuable .

		But this new work is undoubtedly the most impor - tant of all .

		It will comprise five volumes , cov - ering the whole field of Japanese history , three of which have already appeared .

		The first three volumes deal each with a period -- the first treating of
Ancient Japan	LOCATION	, the second of
Feudal Japan	ORGANIZATION	, the third of
Japan	LOCATION	of the Tokugawas .

		Volumes four and five will treat of
Modern Japan	LOCATION	-- i. e. , from the downfall of the Toku - gawa shoguns in
1867	DATE	to the present time .

		There is an introduction of 135 pages in which the author lays down certain laws of the evolu - tion of culture and the history of civilization .

		In these preliminary statements are some views which are distinctly personal , and little likely to receive the unqualified approval of readers .

		The sketch is , however , interesting , suggestive , and entirely in place .

		Coming to his subject proper , the author first presents general facts regarding the land and its peoples .

		He considers the Japanese a mixture of Ural-Altaic and Malay , and thinks these elements are stiU to be traced geogTaph - ically -- the Ural-Altaic landing at
Nagato	ORGANIZATION	and following along the coast of the
Sea of Japan	ORGANIZATION	, while the Malays followed along the Interior Sea .

		Mixing , with little influence from the aboriginal Ainu , these elements have given the present Japanese .

		The aiithor then studies in detail , for each minor period of time , the progress and movement of culture .

		He clearly describes the conditions of life , customs , govern - ment , politics , literature , art , and religion of each .

		Nowhere else , perhaps , can the student find so satisfactory a series of pictures -- de - tailed paintings -- of the Japanese .

		And it is not merely an interestingly descriptive presen - tation ; causes , motives , tendencies , are con - stantly kept in view .

		It is
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of the English People '' over again , but done for the Japanese by a foreigner .

		The move - ment is well sustained , the wealth of detail re - markable , the style attractive , with some striking descriptions of scenery .

		Frequent quotations from Japanese literature are given , not as samples of Japanese writing so much as for the matter they contain .

		To render many of his dis - cussions clear to non-specialists in the oriental field , the author is often compelled to present actual studies of subjects both Japanese and Chinese .

		Thus , preliminarily to considering the introduction and influence of Confucianism in
Japan	LOCATION	, the author enters into a serious exam - ination of Confucianism in itself and in its relations to general civilization .

		One most important feature in our author 's treatment is his constant emphasis upon the outside influences that have acted upon
Japan	LOCATION	and affected its development .

		From its insular nature ,
Japan	LOCATION	is necessarily isolated , and lias escaped much of contact with other nations .

		This has no doubt had its influence in shaping the Japanese character .

		But in spite of its relative isolation ,
Japan	LOCATION	has always received influences from without , and our author delights to trace these in detail .

		Everyone , of course , knows that
China	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	have made a profound impression upon
Japan	LOCATION	, but compara - tively few realize that many more western lands have long been jjotent in her development .

		Our author himself says : '' But priests and literati have taught the Japanese more than Buddhism and Confucianism ; they have taught them the civilization of
India	LOCATION	and of
China	LOCATION	, and therefore that of the entire vvorld .

		Bahylonia and
Egypt	LOCATION	, mothers of all culture ,
Persia	LOCATION	-- mistress of
India	LOCATION	with
Darius	PERSON	, --
Greece	LOCATION	-- mistress of
India	LOCATION	with
Alexander	PERSON	, -- the Roman Empire , sovereigns of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor ,
Cliristianity	LOCATION	, preached even to the Descan and in
Central Asia	LOCATION	, have all left tlieir trace in the civiliza - tion of
India	LOCATION	and even in that of
China	LOCATION	.

		Henceforth the Japanese , rare as their relations with the Continent may have been tlu-ough centuries , participated in the life of the entire world , since they have known the uni - versal civilization . ''

		And this is of
Ancient Japan	LOCATION	.

		Since then , similar influences have continuously made them - selves felt .


Japan	LOCATION	, though lai-gely pursuing a course of independent development , has never been actually shut off from the world .

		Another point of great interest , somewhat akin to the preceding , while thrown sharply into view by the author 's treatment , is sug - gested rather than actually discvissed .

		This is the remarkable synchronism of great world movements in separated areas .

		Feudalism in
Japan	LOCATION	coincides with feudalism elsewhere ; wide - spread and pervasive belief in witchcraft afflicts
New England	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	at the same time ; outbreaks of emotional religion sweep the world irrespective of the petty contact between nations ; periods of unbelief and doubt affect all men simultaneously , -- the
last half of the nineteenth century	DATE	weakened faith alike in Christian dogma , in Buddhist faith and practice , in American Indian animism , in African fetichism .

		And one may seriously inquire whether we are not now at the beginning of a religious revival which wiU sweep the world -- not to the enthi-onement of one great world-religion , but to the strength -

		THE DIAL 247 ening and rebuUding of many now tottering creetls .

		It is not fair to shoulder ail the above illustrations on our author , nor to conunit him to any prediction ; but he clearly brings out the fact of such synchronisms .

		They are most interesting , and can not be fidly explained by contact and interesting influences .

		One characteristic of the Japanese that can - not be too much emphasized is clearly brought out in this work .

		Fraetz wTote , in
1565	DATE	, that the Japanese found great pleasure in meeting strangers and questioning them with curiosity upon the manners and customs of other coun - tries , even into the least details .

		So at the time of
Will Adams	PERSON	, the constant questioning and writing down greatly impresse < l the English and Dutch visitors .

		Golownin , the Russian prisoner of
1811	DATE	, left a delightful account of the repeated inquisitions through which he passed .

		Avidity to take in from without is no new trait in Japanese character .

		The work is supplied with maps , chrono - logical tables , glossaries , and indexes , rendering it thoroughly useful to the student .

		Thus does Mr.

Jackson	PERSON	, filled aU his letters with unprintable expressions , and was as anxious as many a great man before him to l -RRB- e known as a good fellow and a sad dog , -- apparently on the slender show - ing of a few youthful escapades indulged in under the competent tutelage of
Francis Hayman	PERSON	.

		But in spite of unavoidable gaps and defi - ciencies , even the early chapters of the book are not dull .

		Throughout his life
Gainsborough	PERSON	had many interesting friends , most of them actors or musicians ; while all the wit and beauty of eighteenth century
England	LOCATION	sat to him for por - traits , and the royal family patronized him with a truly royal abandon .

		Some anecdotes which Mr.
Boulton	PERSON	relates of Gainsborough 's patrons have but the slightest connection with the painter , but they all help to reproduce the atmosphere of the time in which he lived , and to give , by an economically suggestive method , that sense of background which many more bulky and pre - tentious biographies satUy lack .

		Gainsborough was a spicy and a fluent letter - writer , and it is perhaps by quoting his corre - spondence with
William Jackson	PERSON	of
Exeter	LOCATION	, a musician , and with
Garrick	PERSON	, that Mr.
Boulton	PERSON	throws most light on the artist 's whimsical and capricious temper and independent spirit .

		A letter to
Jackson	LOCATION	, dated at Bath in
1769	DATE	, shows
Gainsborough	PERSON	in his most delightful vein . ''

		My dear
Jackson	PERSON	, -- Now you seem to lay too much stress upon me , and show yourself to be a serious fellow .

		I question , if you could splice all my letters together , whether you could find more connection and sense in them than in many landskips joined , where half a tree was to meet half a church to make a principal object ... '' Depend upon it ,
Jackson	PERSON	, you have more sense in your little finger than I have in my whole body and head ; I am the most inconsistent changeable being , so full of fits and starts , that if you mind what I say , it will be shutting your eyes to some purpose .

		I 'm only sensible of meaning , and of having once said , that I wished you lived nearer to me ... You have one fault , which I must tell you of : you can stop to gaze with wonder and astonishment upon such a fellow as H y , and let slip all his merit of care , labour , and prudent selfishness through your own fingers . ''

		I look upon this letter as one of my most agreeable performances , so do n't let 's have any of your airs .

		I could say a deal noore ; but what can a man say , pent up in a comer thus ?

		-- Yours ,
T. G. '' Jackson	PERSON	seems to have been rather a thank - less friend ; his coldly critical , complacent style in writing of Gainsborough makes an unpleas - ant contrast with
Gainsborough	PERSON	's impidsive solicitude for the mediocre musician 's every interest . ''

		Pray send me word , '' he writes , when news has come that
Jackson	PERSON	is ill , '' whether there is any occasion for Doctor
Moysey	PERSON	to come to you , in
Palmer	LOCATION	's opinion -- 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, damn your own .

		for you are too much like me to know how it is with you . ''

		Equally delightful are the letters to
Garrick	PERSON	, filled with discussions about the actor 's art , in which
Gainsborough	PERSON	was deeply interested , and with considerations regarduig an idealized por - trait of Shakespeare which Grainsborough had in earnest contemplation for several years . ''

		Shakespeare shall come forth , as the lawyer says , '' he declares gaily . '' '

		Damn the original picture of him , with your leave , for I think a stupider face I never saw , except D -- h 's . ''

		But finally he abandons the project -- with equal gayety . ''

		Shakespeare 's bust is a silly smiling thing , and I have not sense enough to make him more sensible in the picture ; and so I teU ye , you shall not see it . ''

		In the person of Governor
Philip Thicknesse	PERSON	,
Gainsborough	PERSON	had a friend and patron whose generosity and solicitous oversight , always exer - cised with characteristic eccentricity , must have been as inconvenient at times as at other times they were welcome .

		At the painter 's death Thicknesse published a short but very inter - esting memoir of him , which is authority for many good stories , seldom accurately dated , but full of the spirit which is more essential than the letter .

		One such anecdote foUows . ''

		When a certain duchess sent to know the reason why her picture was not sent home , he gave it a wipe in the face with his background brush , and sent her word that her Grace was too hard for him ; he would not , he said , paint it .

		That inelegant message lost her an excellent representation of her beautiful person -LRB- for she was beau - tiful -RRB- , and
Gainsborough	PERSON	's spirit deprived him of a hundred guineas . ''

		Governor
Thicknesse	PERSON	did not like Mrs. Gains - borough .

		He relates how , when he was helping
Gainsborough	PERSON	with the troublesome business of finding a house in Bath , and they went to the artist 's wife to report progress , she was thrown into a panic at the mention of the fifty pounds rent . ''

		The poor woman , highly alarmed , thinking it must all come out of her annuity , exclaimed , ' Fifty pounds a year !

		Mr.
Gainsborough	PERSON	are you going to throw your - self into gaol ? '

		But upon my telling her that if she did not approve of the lodgings at fifty pounds a year he should take a house of a hundred and fifty , and that I would pay the rent if he could not ,
Margaret	PERSON	's alarms were moderated . ''

		There was perhaps some excuse for the lady at this time , for
Gainsborough	PERSON	had yet to make his name , but her continued parsimony in later years is certainly against her .

		Governor Thicknesse assures us that if
Gainsborough	LOCATION	, tired with stand - ing before his easel , went to the city on business and took a hackney coach to ease his tired limbs . ''

		He was obliged to be set down in
St. James	LOCATION	's Square , or out of sight of his own windows , for fear of another set down not so convenient either to his head or his heels as riding out twelve pennyworth of coach hire , after having earned fifty guineas previously thereto . ''

		But in spite of the Governor 's anecdotes , and others , Gain.sborough was apparently very fond of his wife , and though he lived in a time when scandal was busy in the painting-rooms of fash - ionable artists , never a word of it was associated with his name .

		We might go on quoting from Mr.
BoiUton	PERSON	almost indefinitely , for he has placed unlimited stores of good things at the disposal of his readers .

		He has utilized the accepted sources of biographical material , marshalling his facts in simple orderly fashion , and dealing with them in a dignified and yet thoroughly genial and appreciative way .

		His descriptions of Gains - borough 's works and his critical comments are likewise written with rare skill and discrimina ^ tion , and it is only because they are less quota - ble than the narrative portions of the book that less has been said about them here .

		Numerous half-tones reproduce
Grainsbor	PERSON	- ough 's portraits and a few of the '' landskips , '' in the painting of which , according to a curious tradition , the artist was happiest .

		His friend Angelo declares : ''
Gainsborough	PERSON	, for all his apparent playfulness of style , often told
Quin	PERSON	, who again assured my father of the fact , that nothing coidd equal the devilism of portrait painting . ''

		Wliich sounds so like Guinsborough that we shoidd never think of questioning its somewhat complicated authenticity .

		The labor leaders have already found what they regard as the heel of Achilles in the part relating to trade unions , and will have none of the au - thor 's advice : and it must be admitted that he has not duly considered in his argument some very important aspects of the subject .

		If the advocates of the present high tariff read his remarks on that subject , he ma .

		\ expect some profane comments from that camp .

		It is diffi - cult to please all : probably it is best to try to be accurate as to facts , for these stand a great deal of hammering .


Germany	LOCATION	has advanced so rapidly during the past few years that
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	are compelled to inquire for the causes of her phenomenal success in manufactures and com - merce .

		Not long ago , this country , which held the '' empire of the air , '' was counted out of the race of
ri %	PERCENT	als in business .

		The essential causes of this material success seem to be scientific investigation , industry , and reliabilitj - , fertile invention , improved organization , and rational care for the workman without whom science and invention would be useless .

		^ Ir .


Dawson	PERSON	, in his book on '' The
German Workman	PERSON	, '' has given a very readable account of that splendid system of '' social policy '' '' by means of which the health and efficiency of the workmen have been promoted as by no other people in the his - tory of the race .

		The principal measure is the imperial industrial insurance system , by means of which millions of persons are lifted above the need of charity and the soiuces of sickness are stopped at their very springs .

		All the efssential features of this masterly policy are clearly de - scribed in Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's book .

		The argument of -RSB- Mr.
Tenney	PERSON	, in '' Contrasts in Social Progress , '' is cumulative .

		The assump - tion -- or , more fairly , the working hypothesis -- is the idealistic theory of social progress , in opposition to the materialistic or economic inter - pretation of history .

		The history of the hiunan race is a series of social experiments , extending over vast areas of territory , over billions of lives , and over ages of time .

		The peoples chosen for stiidy are the Hindus , Chinese .

		Moslems , and Christians .

		The result of these experiments is held to be that , while all these peoples show the benign influence of the truth they knew , the essential truths of Christianity - have had a pe - culiar and special power for good , and surpass all others in power for improvement of social conditions .

		The illustrations of this superiority are found in civic conditions , family life , educa ^ tion , literature , moral thought , altruistic service , self-extending altruistic power .

		Time is an essential factor in progress .

		Christianity itself has never been perfectly represented by its fol - lowers , and the church has been slow to appre - ciate the meaning of the truths for which it stood .

		The world is yet in its infancy , and these ideas have yet before them a vast future for development and creative influence .

		The central ideas which have most transformed mankind are those of the unity and moral character of God , spiritual worship , fraternity of the children of a common Father , and eternal life .

		The author manifestly aims to be fair ; he uncovers the errors and evils of
Christendom	LOCATION	, and praises the virtues and truths of alien civilizations , and everywhere are the evidences of painstaking industry in the collection of facts and of expert judgments .

		The English university life is in an atmos - phere of leisure ; the roots of the tree of knowl - edge are not pulled up every hour , to measure their growth in the
night	TIME	.

		Students there take a long time to read , reflect , compose their sen - tences , and send out a worthy thought in fitting form .

		Mr.
Bussell	PERSON	's '' Christian Theology and Social Progress '' is the ripe fruit of prolongetl reflection and often learned investigation .

		All the great pioneers of philosophy , down to the most recent , are made to yield their contribu - tions to the solution of the ethical and religious problems of our age .

		The central thought of the work seems to be that social progress is without a rational goal and an adequate inspiration if it is not under the guidance and influence of the Christian religion .

		The author says : '' It is my aim to show how general welfare is bound up with the faiths and hopes of Christian belief ; and again , how the general welfere can only rightly be secured by justice to the particular , by resj -RRB- ecting the units which make up the whole ; a heap composed of valueless atoms is itself with - out value . ''

		It is the same question raised by
Tennyson	PERSON	when he asked if one can really re - main enthusiastic and make sacrifices for the life of a worm or a fly .

		It is a striking proof of the freedom of modem science that an honored professor in an orthodox theological seminary , endowed by millionaires , should retain his place and his honors after publishing a plea for socialism , or something very like it .

		The author of '' Christianity and the Social Crisis '' is a teacher of church history , and the historical argument for a social theology is the best part of his book .

		Next to this in 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, value is his honest and searching exposure of the inconsistencies between ecclesiastical conduct and teaching and the fundamental ideas of the Christian religion .

		Of less value is the later and constructive part of the work , where an attempt is made to outline the immediate meas - ures which should be taken to mitigate the evils of our time ; for nothing more than palliatives can be expected until a radical revolution in government has displaced the present political organization of society .

		Such questions can not be successfidly treated in the form of rhetorical appeals to somewhat vague and elementary feelings , and without a mastery of teclmical economic reasoning which is not revealed in the woi ' k itself .

		When we grow weary of writers who flatter the class of '' happy possessors , '' weary of eco - nomic orthodoxy , weary of monotonous praises of patriotism and law , we may refresh ourselves at the pungent and acid
spring	DATE	of anarchistic communism .

		Under the stimiUating influence of such a work as
Kropotkin	PERSON	's '' Conquest of Bread , '' we seem to be living in a world of madmen , and the air about us is full of fanciful images , roots in the air , white mourning goods , black vests at weddings , men with long hair , women with heads cropped and bald .

		Yet
Kropotkin	PERSON	is not a lunatic ; he is a close reasoner , a leai * ned traveller , a keen observer , and he brings into brilliant light uninterpreted truths .

		Reject his extreme individualism if you will ; but you must admit that human society might be better , and that voluntary organization effects more than we credit to its account .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	is not all .

		Even manual work , now associated with inferior social posi - tion and inhuman conditions , may be made attractive to rational men seeking happiness .

		This new edition of '' The Conquest of Bread , '' issued by a publishing house of the conservative type , is a sign of the times , an evidence that we rather prefer to face all possible suggestions , however heretical , and let discussion and reflec - tion and stern experience sift the chaff from the wheat .

		Those who confuse anarchism with socialism may learn from Krojwtkin that these are antagonistic theories , -- perhaps ignorant armies clashing in the
night	TIME	.

		Wild as may seem the speculation , the accoimt of the possi - bilities of scientific agriculture and the doctrine that social science is '' the study of the needs of man and the means of satisfying them '' will justly provoke fresh reflection and open new vistas .

		With the kindest intentions , it is difficult to do justice to a book like ''
Gillette	ORGANIZATION	's Social Redemption '' as interpreted by Mr.
Severy	PERSON	.

		The .

		volume is bulky and has been compiled with great industry .

		Sensational '' stories '' from daily newspapers , even of the '' yellow '' type , are seriously treated as historical materials , without rational criticism .

		All the muckrakers are here invited to unloatl their misavory bur - dens , and the resiJt is a sort of literary dumping - ground .

		Doubtless many of the evils here described really exist , and ought to be made known ; but we also need some constructive suggestions .

		Near the close -LRB- p. 752 -RRB- , in the appendix , the author finally hints at a great discovery , a huge dream which will occupy another tome . ''

		The new system proposes to bring about the amelioration of the race by organizing a world-wide corporation , with an unlimited , elastic , and constantly self-adjusting capitalization -- a capitalization which shall always represent the exact amount of the cor - poi-ate assets , falling as they fall , rising as they rise . ''

		This corporation is to purchase and control all means for the production of wealth throughout the world .

		The curious and cour - ageous reader wUl find in the book more of the same kind of reasoning .

Atlantic Montlily	LOCATION	, '' and now those who are unwilling to take their novels piecemeal may read '' The Helpmate '' in the form of a completed book .

		We may say at once that it is not as remarkable a performance as its predecessor , but we must quickly add that it is so far above the run of novels • The Helpmate .

1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 as to afford a high degree of intellectual satisfaction .

		It tells a semi-tragic story of English pro \ - inL-ial life , and its thesis -LRB- for it is a work of marked tendency -RRB- is that a g ^ ood woman , by virtue of her very gjood - neas , may work the most abominable mischief .

		The title of the book is ironical , for the woman in ques - tion , so far from being a helpmate to her husband , deals with him in such exasperating fashion that she drives him into the immorality of a clandestine establishment .

		It seems to be the author 's intention to condone this lapse , and throw all the responsi - bflity upon the • * spiritual voluptuary '' to whom he is wedded , which attitode results in a certain con - fusion of moral values .

		We are constantly assured , in set terms , that he is essentially a good man -- one of the best of men -- and this assurance , despite tJie clearness of his grievance , we can not discover to be borne out by any interpretation of character based upon his conduct .

		As a matter of fact , he is exhibited to us as the ho -RRB- nme sensuel may en , capable enough of negative goo < lness , bat too easy - going and weak of will to arouse in us any deeper form of sj-mpathy than a mild and qualified pity .

		The wife forgives him , but in a superior sort of way , and what he wants is not so much forgiveness as wifely affection .

		He is constitutionally incapable of sinking to the depth of abasement which , in her opinion , ought to be his spiritual level , and it seems to him that to live a clean life henceforth is the only comfortable and sane way of atoning for his past missteps .

		This , however , is not her affair , and because he will not , of his own motion , remain for - ever plunged in black gulfs of remorse for her mor - bid satisfaction , she thinks that she must make his life miserable by the means that are still within her reach .

		In this she is entirely successful , and , although the book closes with the prospect of a new dawn of hope for his blighted life , it is difficult for us to believe tliat the old estrangement will not soon recur .

		The book is certainly a remarkable study of the marital relation , although in a ease excep - tional rather than tj-picaL It is extremely plain - spoken at times , but not in a way that should offend a healthy mind .

		`` Growth , '' by Miss
Margaret Todd	PERSON	, is a novel difficult to describe in terms that shall convey an adequate idea of its remarkable qualities .

		The title is unpromising , to begin with , and yet it is exactly the right title for a book that records the develop - ment of its characters , and makes us know them by showing us how they react to their environment .

		The substance of the book is verj - largely religious discussion , embracing types of thought as far re - moved from one another as Scotch Presbyterianism and the faith of Some .

		This , again , seems far from a recommendation of the book to the interests of novel-readers .

		And yet without this feature , the storj - simply could not have been brought into exist - ence .

		We can promise those who are not repelled at the outset by these forbidding considerations that they will find in them no cause of serious offence .

		In half a dozen instances at least .

		Miss
Todd	PERSON	has achieved veritable triumphs of characterization ; she has created actual persons into whose lives we enter with the deepest sympathy .

		Xor is a storj ' wanting , although it is a story which makes its essential ap - peal to the cultivated intelligence , and is devoid of sensational happenings .

		The scene is
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, for the most part , varied by excursions to country places , to
Italy	LOCATION	, and even to
Portugal	LOCATION	.

		The men are , mostly theologfical students , ministers , and priests ^ although one layman , a physician , plays an im - portant part .

		Of the women , one is a settlement worker with medical training , another , her sister , is a worldling zealous in the interests of the Catholic church , still another is an actress who becomes cele - brated in the course of the story .

		And out of all this diverse material we get a picture of human life that grows fairly absorbing in its interest as we proceed , a dramatic structure in which the claims of both spirit and sense are allowed , a residual philos - ophy that is shaped to fine intellectnal issues , yet which keeps all the time in close contact with the world of practical affairs . ''

		The Successor , '' by Mr.
Richard Pryce	PERSON	.

		is an English novel three years old .

		although now pub - lished in this country for the first time .

		It con - cerns the desire of Lord
Alton de Merringham	PERSON	for an heir to whom his estate may descend .

		He has already buried two wives when the story opens , and is married to a third , who remains childless , like her predecessors .

		Failing a direct heir , the estate must go to a nephew , a nice enough boy , but one whose mother is so ambitious for her son that she is de - plorably lacking in tact in suggesting Ids claims upon her kinsman .

		In this situation the third Lady
Alton	PERSON	has an idea .

		It is an idea so audaciously im - moral that even a modern novelist would not dare to put it in plain terms , and we come no nearer to a statement in the present instance than the decla - ration of one of the characters that he has `` such a little storj - to tell of silence and mystery and the
night	TIME	as
Boccaccio	PERSON	, at one end of the line of story - tellers , or de Maupassant at the other , would have rejoiced to find to his pen . ''

		What the story is we learn by indirection , and imperfecdy at that as the plot is worked out - Presently Lord
Alton	PERSON	dies ^ r ^ retful at losing his hold upon life , but maliciously - happy in the knowledge that a chUd will soon be bom to bear his name .

		The rest of the stor -RRB- ' deals with the growth of this child to womanhood , the sin - g ^ ular efforts of her mother to appease an awakened conscience , and the final righting by his marriage with the heiress of the wrong that had been done the nephew .

		However venturesome the foundation of its plot , this book can not be charged with gross - ness ; it handles a situation that is , to put it mildly , a difficidt one , with both delicacy and distinction of treatment .

		Its spirit is that of comedy clinging to the skirts of tragedy , and its method has been learned in the school of Mr.
Henrj	PERSON	-
James	PERSON	.

		The seasoned reader will get from it no great harm , but much delightful entertainment The immature reader will do just as well not to make its acquaintance .

Oct. 16	DATE	, For the second time , if memory serves , Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	has found a setting for a novel in the Channel Islands . ''

		A Man of Sark '' tells , in the first person , of the adventures of a sturdy youth who seeks his fortunes as a privateer diu-ing the Napoleonic wars .

		Although loyal to
England	LOCATION	, he is mistaken for a Frenchman after an exciting '' engagement , and his English captors take him to a prison stockade by the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		When he escapes and finds his way back to
Sark	ORGANIZATION	, he is welcomed as one from the dead .

		He is also just in time to rescue the maiden whom he has loved all his life from the hands of certain villainous persons who have abducted her .

		This is only a small part of the whole story , which begins with the hero 's childhood , but it is the dramatic climax .

		The author has evidently steeped himself in the history , the folk-lore , and the `` ustom8 of the island folk whom he describes , and tells a tale that is deeply appealing and full of varied interest .

		We approach Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's '' The Secret Agent '' with anticipations that are not fulfilled .

		Its pro- gramme of anarchists and bombs and detectives promises lively entertainment , but we get instead interminable descriptions and discussions of motive .

		The result is a good story completely smothered by analysis .

		Both analysis and characterization are exceedingly acute , for few men are Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's equals in command of the incisive touch and the illuminating phrase .

		But a novel upon such a theme as this calls for action , and again action , and of this we get next to nothing .

		We hardly recall an equal disappointment since reading '' The Princess Casamassima . ''

		If the reader will make up his mind beforehand to look for nothing but psycho - logical interest , he will find it a-plenty .

		But the natural man in him must be prepared for shocks .

		He will be expected to remain unchafed while a dramatic conversation is indefinitely suspended until the author has freed his own capacious mind at great length , and , when the anarchist outrage which is the climax of the story actually comes off , he will be expected to hark back , and toil laboriously up to the climax a second time .

		These things are exasperat - ing , of course , but they are inseparable from Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's way of working , and those who have read his other books are faii-ly forewarned .

		In compari - son with the bulk of this narrative , its grim closing chapters have an unexpected directness and concen - tration .

		Again , in '' Winston of the Prairie , '' as recently in '' The Dust of Conflict , '' Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	pre - sents us with a hero who is under unjust suspicion of murder , and who , in consequence , seeks new sur - roundings and adopts a new name .

		Again , also , • despite the suspicion attaching to him , he wins the love of a girl who is conquered by his sheer manli - ness , and whose faith in him remains unshaken by false report .

		Here the similarity ends , for the new novel takes us , not to
Cuba	LOCATION	, but to the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, with which country the author showed us his familiarity in '' Alton of Somasco . ''

		The tale is a vigorous one , mostly about people with red blood in their veins , and it has a skilfully-contrived plot .

		The hero 's impersonation of another man ; leads to exciting complications , and it is difficult to see how he is going to extricate himself from the false position in which he is placed .

		But his ser - vices to the little farming community , which he teaches to win prosperity out of seeming disaster , are so substantial that when the hour of disentangle - ment comes , he both clears his name and finds con - donation for his deception .

		In the wheat-raising region of
Western Canada	LOCATION	, Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	has found a field almost as virgin to the novelist as to the agriculturist , and so subdued it to his purposes that his work will not easily be matched .

		We can not help noting one persistent peculiarity of his diction -- the use of the word ''
doUai	LOCATION	's '' where '' money '' would be the natural word to employ .

		Is this idio - matic to the country of which he writes ?

		We have noticed it frequently in all three of the novels above named , and it gives us a slight shock every time it occurs .

		The ingenious author of '' The Cat and the Cherub '' has given us a full-fledged novel in * '
John Kendry	PERSON	's Idea . ''

		It is a
California	LOCATION	novel , and it has much to do with
Chinatown	LOCATION	and its denizens with ways that are dark .

		There is a particularly picturesque old scoundrel named
Chan Kow	PERSON	who , when things get too hot for him , contrives his own taking-off -LRB- by means of a substitute -RRB- , and departs for
Paris	LOCATION	to enjoy his deviously-gotten wealth .

		This obese compound of philanthropy and villainy is an adept in disguises , and we never know under what name or in what form he will next appear .

		He ex - ploits his fellow-countrymen , whom he calls cochons de Chinois , and takes care to gi'atify all his private revenges before he takes his leave from the scene .

		His connection with the story comes from his friend - ship for the hero , to whose father he had owed his start in business , and from his knowledge of the opera - tions of a gang of counterfeiters , whom the hero is bent upon unearthing .

		The motive of this quest is supplied by his interest in a young woman , who is involved with the counterfeiters in some unexplained fashion .

		John 's Idea is a vague one of doing some - thing for the benefit of mankind -- of becoming '' a part of the whole Continuous Performance . ''

		But it is too indefinite to interest us until it finds con - crete embodiment in the heroine , from which time on the story itself is a continuous performance , ex - cept for certain long-winded passages of analytical philosophy that the judicious reader will skip .

		It is a story of many startling surprises ; in fact , there is an ambush upon nearly every page ; that anything like it ever happened , or could happen , we greatly doubt , but that does not prevent its being a highly readable melodrama , with a style that comes near to exhibiting distinction .

		Reading '' The Younger Set , '' by Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	, we are compelled to repeat what we said of `` The Fighting Chance , '' -- that the author has been ill-advised to desert the field of historical and
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 fantastic romance for the field of modern realism .

		He is much more interesting when he deals with Revolutionary scenes and characters than when he deals with the undesirable citizens who live in our modern fashionable society , and who constitute noth - ing more than the scum upon the surface of our real civilization .

		The '' younger set '' as he describes it , and as we know it only too well from journalistic report , seems to be devoid of both manners and ideals , and its existence would be difficult to justify upon any grounds .

		Of course , Jlr .

		Chambers , in his capacity of clironicler and satirist , ostensibly shares this view , but we can not help feeling that he is no less anxious to exhibit his intimate familiarity with the ways of '' smart '' people than he is to scourge their follies and expose the vacuity of their life .

		The treatment is marred by the note of insincerity , and the virtuous types that the author contrasts with the vicious ones are too unreal to be taken seriously .

		The hero is too preposterously goo < l , and the heroine , adorable though she be , is too nearly impossible as a product of such surroundings .

		She is like the pure water-lily blossoming upon the surface of the foul waters , but the simile is too pretty to be true .

		The story has many elements of popularity , and will probably attract a large public .

		Its meloth-amatic contrasts and episodes , the sentiment with which it reeks , the up-to-date jargon of its conversations , and the general animation which pervades it , are quali - ties tliat appeal strongly to the average reader of fiction .

		It has , besieges , certain elemtnts of positive excellence , such as constructive art , poetical elegance of diction , and a sympathetic touch .

		The author is particularly happy in writing about children , and his little girl of twelve or fourteen is so natural and withal so winsome a creation that we are inclined to think of her as the most successful of his char - acters .

		Mr.
Leroy Scott	PERSON	's '' To Him That Hath '' is an unusually striking and effective novel .

		It is basetl upon a principle of casuistry that no clear-sighted person could justify , and it involves a self-sacrifice that is , calmly considered , preposterous , but , given these questionable conditions , the story is invested with absorbing interest .

		The hero , placed in charge of the affairs of the Rev.
Philip Morton	PERSON	, heatl of
St. Christopher 's Mission	ORGANIZATION	in the slum reg ^ ions of
New York	LOCATION	, suddenly deceased , discovers that his friend , reputed a saint , has really conmiitted suicide to escape the consequences of an embezzlement of the mission funds .


David Aldrich	PERSON	, the hero in question , is appalled at the thought of an exposure , and of the blow that it would deal to
Morton	PERSON	's devoted followers , reclaimed from evil by what has seemed to be the example of his devoted life .

		He takes the bm-den of the crime upon liis own shoulders , and suffers the penalty of the law , which means a prison term of several years .

		AH this is hurried over in a few open - ing pages .

		The substance of the story is found in
David	PERSON	's efforts to earn a living after his release , in his struggle with the extreme of poverty and wretchedness , and in his desperate devices to pre - serve the secret which has made him an outcast and left the memory of his dead fi-iend enshrined .

		The heroine , who is the daughter of one of these pluto - crats whom our novelists delight in holding up to contumely , has loved
David	PERSON	before his disgrace , and after his release from prison tries to aid him in the rehabilitation of his character .

		In a deeply impres - sive scene , she at last discovei-s the truth about him , and is ovenvhelmed by compassion at the thought of his long martyrdom .

		At the same time her ej-es are opened concerning the sources of her father 's wealth : she leaves her luxurious home , and becomes Da 'S ` id 's wife , accepting all the obloquy for the sake of her love .

		The plot of the novel is forced , as we have seen , and the action is over-melodramatic , but it is a particularly striking production for all that , and its essential pathos is relieved by much subsidiary inci - dent , and even by touches of genuine humor .

		It was inevitable that the insurance scandals of two years ago should sooner or later furnish the enterprising novelist with materials for a tale .

		Mr.
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	is the one who has seized the opportunity , and his production is entitled '' Light-fingered
Gentry	PERSON	. ''

		The easy-going methods of the insurance coi `` porations , as revealed in the
Hughes	LOCATION	investigation , are effectively exploit `` d. as well as the corrupt alliance of political with finan - cial interests whereby the system was so strength - ened that it seemed impregnable to attack .

		In the case of the novel , matters do not come to the point of public exposure , for the hero is not an eloquent district attorney , but merely an officer of one of the companies , whose interests are best served by its reorganization upon a relatively honest basis of dealing with the public .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	is well ac - quainted with the ins and outs of his subject , but his portrayal of conditions is marked by a stronger bias against the methods of the companies than the facts would be likely to justify .

		Still , considering the possibilities of sensationalism inherent in the theme , he has avoided the extremer forms of over - statement .

		The private interest of the story is inconsiderable .

		The chief magnate has a daughter , who in due course discovers that her father is not tlie humane and upright pei-son she has hitherto believed him to be .

		This is a frequently-worked situation , but in the present case , the young woman in question is not the real heroine .

		That place is filled by the hero 's wife , whom he divorces early in the narrative , and long afterwards , when the rich possibilities of her nature are revealed to hini , he seeks to win once more .

		Thb reawakened love proves doubly his salvation , for it not only restores his domestic happiness , but also works in him a moral regeneration which bears fruit in the conduct of the business which is at last brought under his control .

Gawain	PERSON	and the Lady of Lys , '' translated by Miss

Oct. 16	DATE	, Bkiefs on Neat Books .

		La , t , iudie , The news of the death of Sir
Spencer	PERSON	of an English Walpole camelast
summer	DATE	as a shock scholar .

		^ ^ j-jjg readers of his historical writ - ings .

		His judgments were those of a man of large experience in public affairs .

		He had a sure and penetrating glance beyond the threshold of person - ality , and could estimate the forces which led to great decisions .

		From his writings one would infer that he had the saving grace of humor , and that other grace , akin to it , of genial appreciation of those with whose principles of action he could not agree .

		The loss of a man of such qualities of mind seems intimate and irreparable .

		The regret wiU be increased by the reading of his '' Studies in Biography '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , which was published earlier in the year .

		Several of these essays have already appeared in English reviews .

		With the exception of two -LRB- one on Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	, another on Napoleon III . -RRB-

		, they relate to Englishmen -- Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	, Mr.
Cobden	PERSON	,
Lord Dufferin	LOCATION	,
Edward Gibbon	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Disraeli	PERSON	, and
Lord Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is also an essay on '' Some Decisive Marriages of English History . ''

		Sir
Spencer	PERSON	distributes his judg - ments as he moves along .

		In the case of
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, if not of Disraeli , he uses some hard words .

		One may be inclined to feel , for example , that he gives the famous '' blood and iron '' speech a setting unnecessarily ugly .

		With
Bismarck	PERSON	this was not a dogma of political action , but , rather , an inference from past experience .

		Other men have sought ends which have implied as much bloodshed , but have avoided the odium of declaring frankly where it all led to .

		One reads with greater relish the essays on the Englishmen .

		These do not pre - sent matter which is new to readers of the author 's other books , but they emphasize the personal side and introduce nmch that would be irrelevant in the ordinary historicixl narrative .

		In the essay on Disraeli he reaffirms the opinion which he expressed a few years ago in his `` History of Twenty-five Years , '' -- namely , that Disraeli '' had few deep convictions on the political questions which came before him from time to time ... and he was so intent on the tactics of the political campaign , that he had hardly time to think on the subjects for which he was struggling . ''

		It should be added that the reader receives from all these essays an impres - sion as stimulating as if he had had a quiet and illuminating conversation with a man of wide obser - vation and fruitful reflection .

		Vo „ r centuries ' ^ ^ - T -
H. S. Escott	PERSON	has twice before of English proved himself an astute observer country life .

		^ ^ ^ ^ skilled interpreter of contem - porary social conditions in
England	LOCATION	.

		His latest book , `` Society in the Country House '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , is an intimate , gossippy chronicle of the history of some of the great English estates , particularly those in the southern counties .

		A trenchant introductory chapter explains the fourteenth-century origin of the country house , sketches its rise to the height of its power in
Tudor	LOCATION	times , when its political and social functions had become fully developed , and shows how , now as then , its influence is strong and its place in the structure of English society assured .

		In sixteen lengthy chapters Mr.
Escott	PERSON	conducts his readers to as many gi-oups of country houses , tracing the rise of each great family , characterizing its most interesting representatives and most famous visitors , drawing upon a store of racy anecdote and curious legend , and fully substantiating his claim that the country house has associations with the spiritual , literary , and social movements of the nation , which are even stronger than those more pictm ` esque and popularly recognized bonds which unite it with the chase , the turf , and the stage .

		Mr.
Escott	PERSON	pursues his subject with a leisurely thoroughness that is characteristically British , but his style is crisp and nervous enough to hold the reader 's interest .

		Here is his characterization of the eleventh duke of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, known among his intimates as the '' Jockey , '' and famous for his large hospitality : '' A shrewd , tolerably read , voluble man , with a smattering of literature and science that passed , in a duke , for learning , he said some clever things , about
Ireland	LOCATION	in particular , but more that were merely coarse , on all subjects in general . ''

		Mr.
Escott	PERSON	is an expert gatherer of bon mots , such as
Balfour	PERSON	's description , given at a Battle house-party in
1881	DATE	, of
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's conversation , -- `` A brazen mask talking l | is own novels , '' -- or the Evangelical Mrs.
Sargent	PERSON	's partisan denimciation of
Newman	PERSON	as '' a confirmed old Papist . ''

		The Pembrokes , the Stanhopes ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Disraeli	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and
Horace Walpole	PERSON	are a few of the names that Mr.
Escott	PERSON	mentions most often ; but one merit of his book is its avoidance of monopolies , whether exercised by persons or periods .

		An index to proper names rendei-s Mr.
Escott	PERSON	's mass of material available for hasty consultation .

		The inconstant ^ Curious and not wholly edifying Benjamin spectacle is offered by
Mme. de Stafil Constant	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ ^ j Benjamin Constant in their un - happy attachment to each other .

		Constant appears to have been a good deal of a coquette , and a male coquette less easily wins our indulgence than one of the other sex .

		Mme. de
Stael	ORGANIZATION	's amours were many , and are now too well known to call for comment .

		A parcel of letters written by her , between
1804	DATE	and
1816	DATE	, to her `` most inconstant of Constants '' has been unearthed by a great-granddaughter of Mme. Constant by her first marriage -- the
Baroness Elisa	PERSON	- beth de
Nolde	PERSON	.

		These letters , edited by her with abundant introductory and connecting narrative , have recently been published in French , and are now issued in English -LRB- in
Miss Charlotte Hardwood	LOCATION	's translation -RRB- by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		Sainte-Beuve says of
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	's relations to Constant , that she was `` his male , '' he being of that unrobust , some - what unmasculine character that needs a virile com - plement in its mate .

		The French way of looking
1907	DATE	, -RSB- THE DIAL 256 at such clandestine love affairs as this is well illus - trated by the following editorial paragraph : '' Must one always smile in hearing a liaison spoken of , or regret the indiscretion committed when the details are published ?

		A love that weakens , and sometimes , alas !

		destroys genius , should be punished by oblivion ; but there is another love that is worthy to live by remembrance , because without it , perhaps , genius would not have flown so high .

		It is a necessity with some natures , to find beings whose intelligent under - standing permits them to pour forth their over-full souls .

		To bow to convention , to restrain an un - quenched thirst for happiness , is sometimes more fatal to genius than to give way to its inclinations . ''

		These letters of Mme. de Sta6l , with their frefjuent references to current events , have some historical as well as biographical interest , but are perliaps not quite so important or interesting as the
Baroness de Nolde	ORGANIZATION	would have us believe .

		The translation is a little too obviously a translation .

		This is the situation which Mrs.
Anna Benneson McMahan	PERSON	's skilfully edited antliology , '' With
Wordsworth	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , endeavors to grapple with .

		Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	refers , in her introduction , to the natural desire of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's admirers , when trav - elling through the regions he has immortalized , to identify the actual spots mentioned in the poems . ''

		The attempt to do so from the top of a coach , '' she adds , '' with a copy of ' The Excursion ' in hand , is a familiar sight in the
Lake District of England	LOCATION	.

		The result is a failure both geographically and poet - ically . ''

		It was Professor Knight who , twenty years ago , suggested the publication in one volume of the poems of
Wordsworth	PERSON	containing allusions to the
Lake Country	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	has enlarged the plan to include a few poems connected with the poet 's early life in
Somersetshire	LOCATION	, and some of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's letters , as well as a few of
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	's .

		She has also provided a comple - ment of over sixty very beautiful illustrations , which the publishers have had skilfully reproduced .

		These will recall to the tourist the places that he saw from the coach-top , and they will help the less travelled reader to realize the almost magical charm of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's environment .

		Liist but not least , Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	has written a general introduc - tion , intended to disann popular prejudice against
Wordsworth	PERSON	's self-centred austerity by emphasiz - ing the more winning side of his personality , and also a special introduction for each of the four groups into which she has di \ - ided the poems and letters .

		These prefator -RCB- - notes are verj ' brief , and contain chiefly significant biographical items culled from memoirs not likely to come within the ken of the busy `` general reader . ''

		Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	has already proved herself , -- as editor of ''
Florence	LOCATION	in A ttudv of the Book of Job .

		the Poetry of the Brownings '' and of volumes upon
Shelley	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	, -- a singularly inspiring guide to intimate acquaintance with recondite poetic ti'easure .

		Mr.
Francis Coutts	PERSON	presents in '' The Heresy of Job '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- an attractive and useful volume con - taining , first , introductorj ' matter explaining the editor 's conception of the poem 's purpose and mean - ing ; second , the poem itself divided into three parts .

		Prologue , Debate , and EpUogue ; third , some pages of notes elucidating certain obscurities in the text ; fourth , an appendix containing the speech of Elihu the Buzite , which the editor regards as an in - terpolation ; fifth , a list of commentaries consulted : and , finally , the `` Illustrations of the Book of Job , Invented and Engraved by
William Blake	PERSON	, '' and fii-st published in
1825	DATE	, by
Blake	PERSON	himself .

		Job 's `` heresy '' consisted not in a denial oi Gtod or a rejection of religion , but rather in a refusal to sub - scribe to the smug orthodoxy of his three friends ,
Eliphaz	LOCATION	,
Bildad	LOCATION	, and Zophar , -- a refusal that finds itself amply justified in what the editor entitles `` The Epilogue , '' being tlie last eleven verses of the book .

		Epilogue and Prologue are printed in prose form ; the Debate , or body of the poem , being ar - ranged metrically .

		Worthy of note is the variety of ways in which this work has been classified by its various admirers .

		Mr.
John Owen	PERSON	, in his book on `` The Five Great Skeptical Dramas of Hbtory , '' brackets it with the '' Prometheus Bound , '' ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' '' Hamlet , '' and '' El Magico Prodigfioso , '' as a drama .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has written an essay upon it as an epic poem -- a tribal epic , if we remember rightly .

		And now , following somewhat in his footsteps , Mr ,
Coutts	PERSON	calls it '' one of the gfrandest epic utterances ever given to the world . ''

		The reader may find it worth while , incidentally , to look up Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's recent ai-ticle on a Babylonian forerunner , or archetype , of our biblical Job .

		The Hebrew poet to whose genius we owe the latter is supposed to have lived , in the period following the return from
Babylon	LOCATION	.

Maddox Hueffer	PERSON	has written a good - sized volume designed to be `` an interpretation '' of the English people in town and countrj ' .

		Though not a guide-book in the ordinary sense , the volume may be profitably read by anyone purposing a trip to
England	LOCATION	, for the introductory impressions it affords of the people and their environment .

		To one who has seen
England	LOCATION	and the English at first hand , the book will have only a recreative interest .

		Parts of it wUl remind him pleasantly of his own experiences and impressions , while other parts will suggest to him numerous points of disagreement .

		The author has produced a book of personal impressions only .

		He writes in a slightly psychologic vein , in lang ^ uage as informal as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's , though far less economical .

		The first five chapters , devoted to
London	LOCATION	, form the most # 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, readable as well as the most valuable pai-t of the book .

		They take up , successively , '' The Soul of
London	LOCATION	, '' '' Roads into
London	LOCATION	, '' '' \ Vork in
London	LOCATION	, '' and '' Rest in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		Inviting as these chapter - heads are , the reader will not obtain from a perusal of the subject-matter as much information as he is likely to expect .

		It will give him , however , a use - ful and fairly accurate picture of
London	LOCATION	as it im - presses one to-day , -- of
London	LOCATION	, the ever-growing , all-absorbing city democracy that inspires the admira - tion of every visitor and the interest of every student of municipal institutions .

		The reader of serious purpose will feel no little disappointment that the '' interpretation '' is not more interpretative .

		The author 's over-fondness for dissertation is a blemish that gi-ows more trying to the reader as he advances .

		From
London	LOCATION	one is taken through another series of chapters into the English country .

		Instead of a description of that which is truly picturesque from the traveller 's point of view , or a study of social and industrial conditions such as would appeal to the student .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	talks diffusively of rural sights and scenes , of people and their manners , in terms half historical and half in the present tense . ''

		The Spirit of the People , '' '' Faiths , '' and ' • Conduct '' ai-e among the subjects which conclude the volume .

		Every broad-minded Canadian will oth ` ert `` ee ` her .

		welcome such reasonable criticism of himself and his country as is con - tained in Mr.
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	's ■ '
Canada	LOCATION	To-day '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	frankly admits the limi - tations of any such attempt to appraise the life and cliaracteristics of a new country , developing with extraordinary rapidity , and presenting problems of unusual complexity , from the data of a more or less casual visit .

		At the same time he very properly contends that the intelligent onlooker lias the advan - tage over the native of a broader and more detached point of view .

		He wUl , of course , '' ■ miss all the finer texture of the spirit and life of the people , will learn very little of their domestic life or the subtler psychology that underlies their social and religious institutions : he will make some false generalizations by imperfect induction , some abso - lute errors of observation or of record , upon which critics will rightly fasten for the harrying process which they profess . ''

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	thus shrewdly disarms the well-meaning reviewer .

		It may be said , however , with strict impartiality , that in the main he has handled such questions as the so-called Americanization of
Canada	LOCATION	, British Columbian problems , the immigi-ation policy of the country , the French in
Canada	LOCATION	, the Colonial preference , etc. , with fairness and more than a measure of intelli - gence .

		A large portion of the book is devoted to a discussion of
Canada	LOCATION	's fiscal policy , past , present , and prospective .

		While Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's views on fiscal questions are somewhat discounted by his atti - tude -LRB- that of the typical Britisli free-trader -RRB- of com - plaisant incredulity as touching the possibility of merit in any other fiscal system , his analysis of the Canadian tariffs and their influence upon the growth of
Canada	LOCATION	's trade with
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, respectively , is a valuable addition to the literature of the subject .

		Thf reiolt of doivn-trtHldm mittionf .

		How can it be right , how is it even possible , for us to enjoy life and to take delight in literature and art , when millions of our fellow-beings are starving and other tens of millions are only keeping the wolf from the door by a dreary and desperate struggle of lifelong duration ?

		This question can not but present itself to the reader of Mr.
Charles Edward Russell	PERSON	's social and economic studies entitled `` The Uprising of the Many '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		These chapters , largely a republication of material that has already appeared in '' Everybody 's Magazine , '' form a powerful in - dictment against the shameless greed of `` vested interests , '' and exhibit om * own country as tolerating , constitutionally , legally , and by tacit consent , some 1 of the most outrageous injustices in the history of the world .

		The author has travelled widely , and with his eyes open ; and while he brings from
India	LOCATION	, with her famines and plagues and other preventable ills of the most grievous sort , an account of social con - ditions that goes some way toward reconciling an i American to his own happier lot , the description of certain excellent features in the government of j
Switzerland	LOCATION	and in the young commonwealths of i
Australia	LOCATION	and
New Zealand	LOCATION	, with detailed pictures j of the seemingly excellent working of governmentr !

		owned railways and other public utilities , almost inspires a longing to emigrate .

		The book tends to convince one , among other things , that there may be something of profound wisdoni in President
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's recent suggestion that we need a new constitution adapted to the new conditions .

		It is rather strange that Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's wide-ranging travels and studies failed to include
Russia	LOCATION	; but his book is rich in instructive matter as it is .

		Some radirat domeitie reform !

		Few subjects are so unfailingly inter - esting to aD sorts and conditions of readers as the subject of hygiene -- as the quack-medicine advertiser well knows .

		But the book now under review is not the production of a quack .

		Dr.
Norman Bridge	PERSON	's ''
House Health	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Papers '' -LRB- Duftield -RRB- contains much good advice , and some that is perhaps not so good be - cause the counsel of an extremist .

		The exchange of children he seriously urges as a remedy for evils arising from incompatibility of temperament , thus making light of the sacredness of filial and parental bonds .

		He also recommends the transfer of children from parents who for any reason feel offspring to be a burden , to childless couples whose happiness is incomplete for the lack of offspring .

		The virtue of ventilation and of out-door life finds an ardent advocate in Dr. Bridge : but to maintain that houses full of cracks and crannies make excel - lent homes because sure to be well ventilated , is going to extremes , as perhaps also his advising us

		THE DIAL 257 to sleep with a draught Wowing across the l -RRB- ed and never to fear catching cold from an inrush of pure air .

		But the fresh-air doctrine can hardly do harm even when preached in this radical form .

		The abomination of stuffy living rooms and unventilated assembly halls contributes much to the unenjorment of life , to put it mildly .

		One point , in closing , to poor sleepers .

		If noises keep you awake , take a small lump of paraffin , warm it in the mouth , chew - ing it , perhaps , to soften it , and apply it as a stopper to the ear -- a morsel to each ear .

M. Gabriel Compayr	PERSON	^ .

		The subjects of the volumes are as follows : `` Jean JaeqsM Bonaseau and Education from Nature , '' '' Her - bert
Spencer	PERSON	and Scientific Education . '' ''

		Pestalorzi and
Elementary Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Herbart and Education by Instmction , ^ '' Montaigne and Education of the Judg - ment , '' and ''
Horace Mami	PERSON	and the PubUc School in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The tnnslatioos oi these volumes are by various hands .

		Professor
Hugo P. Thieme	PERSON	's '' Guide Bibliographique de la
Litt	PERSON	^ rature Fran?aise de 1800 k 190C '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: H. Welter -RRB- is a work that represents an enormous labor on the part of the compiler .

		There are upwards of five hundred large double-c-olumned pages of fine print , giving ns complete list # of the publications of nearly a thousand authors , with dates and publishers , and , with each author of any importance , a bibliography of criti - cal referenees , based upon both books and periodicals .

		More than eight thousand volumes of periodical liter - atnre have been searched for these references , and this represent * only a part of the editor 's labors .

		Many a student will arise to eall him blessed for thus coUectiug this mass of bibliographical material , and classifying it for ready use .

		.

		\ new edition of '' Stars of the Opera , '' by Miss
Mabel Wagnalls	PERSON	, Ls published by the
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a volume of sketches , based upon personal interviews with tome of our best-known operatic singers , while between these interviews are interspersed sketches of the operas with which these artists are chietiy iden - tified .

		There are many illustrations .

		A 8ee < md series of Miss
Gladys Davidson	PERSON	's `` Stories from the Operas '' is published by the
J. B. lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume contains also biographical sketches and has portrait illus - trations . ''

		The

		Anyone wishing to buUd , remodel , or decorate a house , or to plan a suitable garden for it , can find some - thing suggestive and to his purpose in Mr.
William Herbert	PERSON	` sbook of architectural studies , reprinted from the `` Architectural Record '' under the title `` Housesfor Town or Country '' -LRB- Duifield -RRB- .

		The book is la \ ishly illustrated , with a view both to making details plaiuer and to prov - ing the author 's main contention , namely : that
Ameri	PERSON	- can architecture , after pursuing its course through the devious errors of heterogeneous imitation , has entered upon a renaissanee and has already acquired a certain distinctive and national quality , artistic because appro - priate to our climate and modes of living .

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	discusses typical town and country houses and the house for all the year , both in general and in detail . ''

		The American Coimtry Estate '' and '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	in Rela - tion to Out-of-Doors '' are two suggestive titles to the would-be landscape gardener , and a concluding chapter on '' New Uses of Old Forms '' contains some interesting theories about original effects , good and bad .

		The twenty-first volume of '' Book-Prices Current '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Elliot Stock	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has come to hand .

		It con - tains a very full report of nearly sixty books-sales held in
London	LOCATION	during the season of 1906-1907 .

		Care has been taken to omit nothing important , irrespective of the prices realized , and to make the index especially complete and convenient .

		Tlie sales of the libraries of Mr.
Van Antwerp	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	and of the
Duke of Sutherland	ORGANIZATION	were of exceptional interest , and full reports of these and other very important sales , with the neea - sarv descriptions and notes , have made the current volume a little larger than usual .

		The unusually high average price for the year is accounted for by the record sums realized for a few highly prized works , such as the Kilmamock edition of Bums 's poems , which brought # 700 ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's first fobo ,
1623	DATE	, 13,600 ;
Walton	PERSON	's `` Compleat Angler , ''
1653	DATE	, # 1,290 : and .

		among the manuscripts , the Shellev Note Books , which sold for # 3,000 .

		The '' thin paper '' editions of standard authors pub - lished by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	provide much good reading in moderate bulk and at a corre - spondingly moderate price .

		We have before us an edition of Hugo 's novels in eight volumes , including ''
Hans	PERSON	of
Iceland	LOCATION	'' and ''
Bug Jargal	PERSON	, '' besides the five great works .

		We have also a ten-volume set of the more popular historical romances of
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Sue 's '' The Wandering Jew '' makes a two-volume set uni - form with the above .

		A collection of '' Imperial Songs , '' being poems by the Emperor of
Japan	LOCATION	and other imperial and distin - guished personages , reproduced in autog ^ raph facsimile , as well as in English translations by the Rev.
A. Lloyd	PERSON	, is an interesting volume that comes to us from the
Kinkodo Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		Here is a sample poem , expressive of one of the many admirable senti - ments of His Majesty : '' The foe that strikes thee for Uur ooontry 's sake Strike him with all thr micht .

		But while thou strik ` st Forget not gtill to love him . ''

		The same translator pves us '' The Praises of Amida , '' in a series of seven Buddhist sermons from the Ji ^ tan - ese of Mr.
Tada Kanai	PERSON	.

		This booklet is published at
Yokohama	LOCATION	by Messrs.
Kelly	PERSON	and
Walsh	PERSON	.

		ADAM
SMITH	PERSON	AND MODERN SOCIOLOGY a study in the method - ology of THE SOCIAL SCIENCES .

		By
ALBION W. SMALL	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is the first of a series which the author will edit on the preparations for sociology in the fragmentary work of the nineteenth-century social sciences .

		The main argument of the book is that modem sociology is virtually an attempt to take up the larger program of social analysis and interpretation which was implicit in
Adam Smith	PERSON	's moral philosophy , but which was suppressed for a century by prevailing interest in the technique of the production of wealth .

		It is both a plea for revision of the methods of the social sciences and a sy-mptom of the reconstruction that is already in progress .

		NOTES 291 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 292 TIfi : EQUIVOCATIONS OF PRAGMATISM .

		Technical metaphysics is not the province of The Dial .

		But a fasliion of thinking , the name of which '' fairly spots the pages of the philo - i < ophical journals , '' and which has even Ixicome a theme of newspaper jest and comment , is perhaps not too recondite for a journal of the broader literary criticism to which nothing human is alien .

		The Pragmatic Sanction , if I may say so , of pragmatism is found in the fact that Professor
James	PERSON	and Mr.
Schiller	PERSON	-LRB- who calls it Humanism -RRB- have wTitten entertaining books about it .

		From the pragmatist point of view , this suffices .

		The cause or concomitant of so pleasing an effect must be itself commendable .

		Philosophj ^ , we are told , is an affair of tem - perament .

		And as we all have temperaments , but are not quite sure that we have philosophies , we are flattered .

		But .

		imfortunately , in addition to the genial pragmatist temperament that willingly accepts a '' loose world , ' '' and could be content in the tub of Diogenes if open to the sun and air , there exists as an irreducible fact the thin , rigid , logical temijerament -- whether to be classified as tough or tender I hardly know .

		And the first reaction of this temperament to a new all-embracing philosophy that can '' satisfy both kinds of demand . ''

		and at the same time agreeably tickle our sense of subtlety and inge - nuity , is a lot of uncomfortable distinctions and reserves .

		All philo.sophies outside of Bedlam admit the appeal to experience .

		But a phil - osophy that peremptorily demands the `` cash value '' of every proposition in experiential terms may sometimes be in too great a hurry to '' cash in . ''

		Some propositions , as
Cicero	LOCATION	knew , can be cashed only by a clever orator at the bank of opinion .

		All philosophies to-day accept in some sense the test by resiUts .

		But a philosophy that makes special profession of so doing runs the risk , despite the caveat '' unless the belief incidentally clashes wth other ^ ^ tal benefits , '' of contemplating only immediate , ob \ ` ious , emo - tional consequences , to the neglect of the remoter effects which must be tracetl by close observation and prolonged consecutive thought .

		The imme - diate results of pragmatism are readable lectures , and a pleasant stir and hum , as of '' something doing ' in the philosophic world .

		But if the remote consequences of this contribution to the gayet -RCB- ' of nations included a weakening of the sense of logical coherence and relevancy in all who take the game seriously , a painfid utilitarian calculus would be required to determine the inclination of the balance of profit and loss , and the consequent truth or falsity of the doctrine .

		The comprehensiveness claimed for the new philosophy seems to rest on a series of equivo - 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, cations .

		The Platonist 's , the
Schoolman	PERSON	's , the Berkeleian insistence on unequivocal definition of all ambiguous terms is triumphantly annexed as a part of the pragmatic method .

		But in his own practice there is nothing of which the pragmatist is so shy as the explicit acknowl - edgment of the double meanings of his words . ''

		Rationalist , '' for example , is habitually taken in the sense of a priori absolutist , though a recognition of the meanings given to the term in
Lecky	LOCATION	's , or rather in
Benn	PERSON	's , '' History of Rationalism '' would force pragmatism to choose between identification with its own left wing of positivism and its right wing , '' The Will to Believe . ''

		The test of theory as '' working hypothesis '' by its results in the scientific order of verifiable external fact is continually con - founded with the test by alleged or predicted consequences in the moral , social , and emotional order .

		True ideas are defined as those which we can '' assimilate , corroborate , validate , verify '' -- as if the indefinite subjective terra ' ■ assimilate '' were synonymous with the precise objectivity of '' verify . ''

		In style as well as in logic , the pragmatist manifests a gi-eat-soided superiority to consist - ency .

		He protests in the name of nominalistic devotion to the concrete richness of particular fact against such innocent abstract personifica ^ tions as ' The Law , '' '' The Latin Langiiage , '' but habitually speaks of his own philosophy as `` she '' and dwells complacently on '' her '' gen - iality , `` her '' comprehensiveness , `` her '' demo - cratic mannei 's .

		And it must be admitted that '' she '' is attractive .

		She jumbles unrelated things in so fascinating an Emersonian fashion that the toughest mind has a glimmering of their final reconciliation in God .

		She says undisputed things in such a lively way that one must be not only hard-headed but hard-hearted not to iiccept the disputable into the bargain .

		Fcmme est souve?it varie : She wins our assent to the statement that abstract propositions must be verified in pai-ticular experiences , and asks us to admit that speculative opinions are `` validated '' if they warm the cockles of our heart and help us to live .

		She is convulsed with laughter at the old-fashioned seventeenth-century gai * b of the encyclopaedic
Leibnitz	PERSON	, but is willing to bury
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	because , in spite of his bad literary manners , his heart wa.s in the right place and he was fond of little -- facts .

		She affirms that abso - lute truth is a chimsra , and infers not that probability is the guide of life and our chief study should be its degrees , but that one thing is as probable as another -- and more so , if it is interesting or consoling .

		She begins with reason as the faculty or method by which we inquire what is , or must be , or probably will be , and ends by celebrating it as the triumph - ant affirmation of what we wish to be .

		She alternately takes '' rational '' in the sense of intelligible , in terms of efficient causation , and intelligible in terms of conformity to the heart 's desire .

		She denounces metaphysics as a cobweb of verbal illusion spun by schoolmen , and instead of dropping it and devoting herself to philology , mathematics , or history , spins a new web of her own with glittering threads of metaphor and epigi-am .

		Such is Pragmatism in its most brilliant repre - sentative .

		Professor
James	PERSON	.

		It is not a logically coherent doctrine or method , but the picturesque expression of a temperament , and of certain lively likes and dislikes -- of the genial instmct for the illuminating , the vivid , the human touch that makes his writings such good reading , of a Baconian delight in the rhetorical exaltation of scientific method and exact verification , com - bined with a vivacious impatience of the thing , of a distaste for the tender , solemn , periodic , and pantheistic fluency of his friend and colleague Professor
Royce	PERSON	, and a natural preference for his own breezy , staccato , eruptive , electrifying , Emersonian manner ; above all , of the wish to believe , or retain the right to believe , in cer - tain manifestations the probability of which in the present state of our knowledge is negligible , and a consequent aversion to those close esti - mates of the degrees of reasoned probability which tend to circumscribe and hamper the flights of popular philosophy .

		But there are other types of pragmatist and other methods of approach to the doctrine .

		To some , it is simply scientific positivism or empiricism .

		Philosophy and literature , which are hardly progressive sciences , periodically awaken to the perception that their formulas have become conventionalized and have lost touch with life and fact .

		The cry is raised , `` Back to nature and reality . ''

		This experience is felt as unique by each new generation of reformers and innovators .

		And the new for - mida , even when no better than the old , is at least for a time more vividly realized .

		Many students of our own day , brought up in what Mill woidd undiscriminatingiy style the '' Ger - man school '' of philosophy , and supposing them - selves to be at the opposite pole of thought from Mill , have , under the steady pressure of physical
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		275 science and modem empiricism , been forced into substantial agreement with him .

		But they are unwilling to wear the old-fashioned Comtist or positi ^ - ist label .

		And they hare too long bowed to the idol of '' Apperception '' to profess them - selves at this late day followers of the mere assoeiationist Mill who had no use for the word in his vocabulary .

		Pragmatism enables them to express their painfully achieved empiricism in a language which may blend in any desired proportion new elements with the pious reten - tion of Hegelian and Kantian terminology In a Pickwickian sense .

		Again , there is the psychological and evolu - tionary '' method of approach .

		From this point of \ - iew , the much abused
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	is the chief inspiration of the pragmatists .

		For it is from him that they learned to look upon mind as an instnunent gradually fashioned in the evolutionary process to serve the practical needs of the organism .

		-- though , it is true , the germ of the same idea might have been found in a more poetic form in
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's doc - trine of the subordination of the intellect to the will .

		But is not this an admission that , after all , pragmatism is • • true '' ?

		If the intellect is merely a tool , a means to an end .

		how can it isolate itself and operate disinterestedly in vacuo ?

		Well , absolutely it crannot .

		But we are not dealing with absolutes .

		In actual human experience we know that there is a vast differ - ence between the '' dry light of the intellect '' and the mind all of whose processes are suffused with emotion and which easily believes what it wills .

		We know that in nothing do men differ more than in the measure they possess of this power of clear-eyed intellectual detachment -- which we may denominate , according to taste , the Schopenhauerian release of the intellect from the sla \ `` ish
ser %	PERCENT	- ice of the will , or Evolution 's last best gift lo man .

		It is a verj - precious gift ; and if pragmatism tends to confuse and impair it , to encoui-age in its st `` ad vague , loose , and emotional thinking , why .

		pragmatism is prag - matically condemned by its own consequences .

		Lastly , we may note as a third possible prag - matic group .

		-- the practical men .

		the men who ask to have • ' the goods delivered . ''

		who want to `` get there . ''

		who believe that '' nothing succeeds like success , '' who are ' • out for the dollars '' and the votes , who are confronted by • • a condition , not a theory , '' who know that the measure is sure to pass , who deplore their dexiations from the absolute ideal , but who '' had '' to have the money , or carry the precinct , or sell a hundred thousand copies .

		We fancy them especiallv nu - merous in our hustling time .

		But the Socrates of Plato 's '' Gorgias '' held debate with them long ago .

		and heard and said all that there is to be said pro and con .

		They are not philosophers , thotigh they supply matter for philosophy .

		And they are naturally attracted to a philosophy which not only justifies their t -RSB- k-pe .

		which is well .

		but may seem to • • ^ • alidate '' the surrival of no other type , which is not so well .

		But why this fierce denimciation of the harm - less necessary shibboleth of the most up-to-date philosophy ?

		^ Tiy .

		because it is neither necessarj '' nor harmless , but superfluous so far as true , confusing so far as equivocal , and emasculating so far as false .

		A professed pragmatist may be .

		as we have seen , a positi > ` ist imwilling to wear his label , a half-emancipated Hegelian , a pjs - chologist systematically exaggerating the sub - ordination of the intellect to the will , a Kantian postulating what he can not prove * ' as if '' it were so .

		a Newmanite undermining reason in the interests of dogma ; a wistful poet consulting the • ' Oracle of the Gold-fishes '' : a Napoleonic seomer of • • ideologists '' : an adept in psychical research asking us to accept the indefinitely improbable because in the infinity of our ignorance we can - not prove it a priori impossible ; a writer of genius confounding and exploiting all these tendencies in an entertaining book .

		Such a word can only confuse the public , as it has con - fused the publishers of Professor
Santayana	PERSON	, who gravely advertise that poetic but fundamentally hard-headed rationalist as a pragmatist .

		Of all the possible meanings of the term , there remain but one or two not already better expressed .

		It might be used to name the in terrorem argument popular with a certain school of Apologetics , which challenges us to accept its d -LRB- ^ ^ mas on penalty of dire consequences to the soul 's welfare or the social order if we do not .

		But the prag - matists themselves woidd lie the first to protest against this limitation of the term , and Mr.
Alfred Benn	PERSON	has coined a better name , or at least a less ambiguous one .

		for the idea in his • • Ophelism . ''

		There remains the supposition that
Pragma	PERSON	- tism is merely the will or the right to believe , masquerading in the garb of scientific positivism and unmetaphysical common-sense .

		This the pragmatist pronounces • • an impudent slander . ''

		But a door must lie either open or shut : and if Pragmatism is not essentially the will to believe , the emlvirrassing question which its ingenious expositor received one morning on a postcard recurs : '' Is a pragmatist necessarily a complete materialist and agnostic ? '

		276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		The
November	DATE	issue of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' is probably the most interesting num - ber ever published of any American magazine .

		It marks the completion of the first half-century of a periodical whose distinction may fairly be called unique -- a periodical more intimately associated than any other with the best traditions of our liter - ature , and intrenched as no other has ever been in the affections of our more serious public .

		No other magazine is a national institution in the sense of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' and no other can boast a career of such high and uniform .

		achievement .

		Adapting itself freely to the changing needs of the successive years , it has always stood for sobriety and sanity as well as for literary excellence , and has always upheld the finer ideals of thought and conduct .

		For this steadfastness in the faith as delivered to the fathers of the republic it deserves well of their descendants , and the ripe age to which it has now attained should prove the occasion of many a warm tribute to its virtues .

		As the covers of the magazine have informed us for many years , it has been devoted to literature , science , art , and politics , and it is thus appropriate that each of these great interests , as related to American life , should be made the sub - ject of a fifty years ' review in this jubilee number .

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, President
Pritchett	PERSON	, Dr.
Mabie	PERSON	, and President
Wilson	PERSON	, are the respective authors of these four retrospective surveys .

		But even more interesting is Professor
Norton	PERSON	's account of '' The Launching of the Magazine , '' Mr.
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	's '' An Early Contributor 's Recollections , '' Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	's `` Recollections of an
Atlantic Editorship	LOCATION	, '' to say nothing of the hitherto unpublished poem by
Lowell	LOCATION	, -- all of which f eatm ` es precede the fom - special summaries .

		Nor is the feast yet ended , for President
Wilson	PERSON	has no sooner ended his plea for the individualism that is essentially American , than Mr.
Arthur Oilman	PERSON	entertains us with an account of ''
Atlantic Dinners	ORGANIZATION	and Diners . ''

		He is followed by the present editor , who has unearthed the old cor - respondence-book of
F. H. Underwood	PERSON	, and , under the caption '' The Editor Who Was Never the Editor , '' has printed a great niunber of interesting letters .

		Finally , we have a chatty contribution on '' Unbound Old Atlantics '' by Miss
Lida F. Baldwin	PERSON	.

		We say finally , and yet besides all these treasures of reminiscence , the anniversary number contains much matter of the usual sort .

		But that is another story .

		... The cheekful improvidence of genius has something winsome in it , even to those who have to foot the bills of these care-free children of the muses .

		Burns , De Quincey ,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
William Oodwin	PERSON	,
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and all the other
Harold Skimpoles	PERSON	, whether of fact or of fiction , are interesting and attractive largely because of their sharing with the lilies of the field a constitu - tional inability to toil and spin .

		That very lack of practical foresight that irritates us , and that would bring speedy ruin and disgrace upon oui ' own heads , somehow allures and fascinates the uncalculating part of our nature , which , after all , so largely governs our conduct and so almost exclusively deter - mines our affections .

		No worldly-unwise absurdity or unpredictable eccentricity on the part of the late artist
Whistler	LOCATION	, for instance , could make him other than a most entertaining and , on the whole , ingra - tiating personality .

		There has lately come to light an incident that illustrates , though not in just the way one might have expected , his extraordinary forgetfulness in practical matters and his utter lack of business instinct .

		Being dunned by a creditor whose patience had become exhausted , and receiving formal notice that legal measures would be resorted to unless remittance of the amount due was made by return of post , the artist sought the aid and advice of a friend living in the neighborhood .

		Explaining that he had a small balance at his banker 's , the amount of which he could not tell , he asked his friend to stop at the bank on his way to business and ascertain how much the deposit lacked of eighteen pounds , the amount of the debt ; and this deficiency the friend was requested to make good , as a temporary loan , so that
Whistler	LOCATION	might imme - diately mail a check to his creditor .

		The desired assistance was promised , and soon the state of the artist 's account was being looked into by the bank cashier , who after a few minutes ' search among the ledgers submitted to the astonished friend a memo - randum indicating that
James A. McNeill Whistler	PERSON	had to his credit a balance of something over six thousands pounds -- a pleasant revelation to the absent-minded depositor , though he was sorely puz - zled to account for the whence and the wherefore of that astonishing balance .

		The late dean of British men of letters ,
David Masson	PERSON	, so long survived the appearance of his more important literary works that probably more than one admirer of his monumental '' Life of Milton '' only became aware that its author was still alive from reading the notice of his death -- if the bull is permissible .

		Sixty-three years ago
Carlyle	PERSON	hailed the young author of `` The Three Devils : Luther 's ,
Milton	PERSON	's , and Ooethe 's '' as the honestest of literary craftsmen and a friend that was simple , sincere , open-minded , and helpful .

		Long after that , it is interesting to recall , this honest literary crafts - man was proposed to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, or by him , as perhaps the suitable person to undertake the difficult and delicate task that finally , as all the world knows , fell to
Froude	PERSON	.

		In a review of Lord
Cockburn	PERSON	's '' Life of Lord
Jeffrey	PERSON	, '' contributed to '' The North British Review '' fifty-five years ago , Professor
Masson	PERSON	, discussing Scottish influence on British literature , inclines to the opinion that the peculiar characteristic of the Scotch intellect , the funda - mental quality of the perfervidum incjenium
Scot	PERSON	- orum , is emphasis . ''

		All
Scotchmen	PERSON	are emphatic ''
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL `` 77 he declares .

		^ If a Seotefaman is a fooL he gives such emphasis to the nongetwe he ntters as to be considerably more insufferable than a fool of any other coontry : if a Scotchman is a man of genins .

		he gives such emphasis to the good things he has to eommunicate that they have a supronely good ehanee of being at once or very '' oon attended to . ''

		In
Ifasson	ORGANIZATION	's vigor and effectiveness there is sorely no ladt of emphasis .

		Whatever he had to conimnnicate had a ver -RCB- * good chance of being attended to with - out much delay .

		Bom in
Aberdeenshire	LOCATION	and hold - ing for almost half his long life a professorship in
Edinburgh University	ORGANIZATION	, he was through and through a Scotchman , and was also the teacher of eminent
Scotchmen	PERSON	, from
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	and
Henrj	PERSON	- Drum - mond in the late siarties , to
Barrie	PERSON	and
Crockett	PERSON	in the early eighties -- and who knows how many others , of a later decade , that are still to make themselves famous ! '

		As first editor of ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine , '' young
Masson	PERSON	rallied about him as contributors many of the foremost writers of the time , with
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	among them .

		As a force stimulating to good literary work by both example and precept , he made himself felt in
London	LOCATION	as afterward in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		Filling for many years a chair of English literature and rhetoric , he gained the love as well as the respect of his pupils .

		`` His work in the class , '' sapi one who knows .

		• • was always alive with enthusiasm , the enthusiasm bom of broad scholarship and resolute conviction that he had a great message to deliver .

		The text of the lectures was not the main thing : it was the man .

		Belief , not novelty , is the basis of all originality .


Masson	PERSON	did not seek to train special researchers along Ph.D. lines of barren activity : his aim was ever to develop that latent power of vision which is the source of all great literary ejcpression . ''

		• • • The Rhodes scholabs fbom this oocxtky , of which the first have now been graduated , promise to reflect no discredit on the land of their birth .

		It is just three years ago that fortv -- three students from all parts of the
United States	LOCATION	, from urban universities and from fresh-water colleges , matriculated at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and selected their various courses of stndy .

		Of this number two died and one resigned his scholarship before completing the course , while the remaining fortv - are accounted for as follows : Twenty-four entered regular courses leading to the degree of
A.B.	LOCATION	.

		three choosing claasies .

		seven history , six law , four English literature , two theology , one German , and one geology .

		In the published dass lists at the end of the course , six were placed in the first class , eight in the second , seven in the third , and three in the fourth .

		As it is a distinction to win even a second class , and no dishonor to be enrolled in the third , it will be seen that our twentj -- fonr made a very creditable showing .

		Of th ^ sixteen students study - ing for degrees other than
A.B.	LOCATION	.

		five chose the course leading to the deg ^ ree of Bachelor of Civil Law , the hardest coarse at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and usually entered upon by Englishmen only after an ordinary law coarse and several years ' practice at the bar .

		One of the five Americans took a first daas an examination at the end , one a second , and the othos thirds .

		# ag ^ American students followed special or research coorses analogous to those required for the ^ i.D. \ degree in our universities : but three were forced to abandon their projects for lack of adequate instruc - tion or direction , two failed to pass their examinadons , and three secured degrees .

		Of the three remaining I out of the whole namber , one chose not to ~ read '' I for any d ^ ree , while the other two selected courses impossible to finish in three years ; and one of these two remains longer , at his own expense , the other l > eing permitted to carry on his studies tn aiagHtia .

		This is a very good showing , on the vhole , f < v pioneers , and encourages hope for better things still to come .

		If none of our men has yet proved him - self a prodigy of scholarship , a
Rhodes Colossus	ORGANIZATION	, so I to speak , it must be remembered what disadvantages I of various kinds this initial lot of Americans had to contend against in meeting the Oxford students on their native heath .

		But whatever they may have failed to acquire of book-learning , they have enjoyed advantages of foreign traveL have seen a bit of the great world , and have in most cases picked up a modern language or two , in a oonversational way .

		on the Continent .

		... The kbscue of the Haxvaki > Hottse at
Stratford	LOCATION	is to be credited to two widely separated : and widely different persons -- Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	i of
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	.

		and Mr.
Edward Morris	PERSON	of '
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The current number of `` The Harvard < Graduates ' Magazine '' gives an interesting aoeount , from
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	's pen .

		of her disinterested and -LRB- by ilr .

		Morris 's generous aid -RRB- successful endeavors to preserve for all time -LRB- humanly speaking -RRB- the : historic house on High Street ,
Stratford	LOCATION	, where in I the year
1605	DATE	Katharine R < ^ r8 married Robert !

		Harvard , and where , as a boy of seven or eight , their son
John	PERSON	, visiting his grandparents , must more than once have seen
William Shakespeare	PERSON	pass along the street to or from the bouse that he had recently built for himself , and that was long a ^ suffered to yield to the ravages of time , or iconoclasm .

		This Rogers-Harvard house was bailt in
1596	DATE	, when
Katharine	PERSON	was twelve years old .

		by her father
Thomas Rogers	PERSON	: and before
Miss Corelli	PERSON	and Mr.
Morris	PERSON	took in hand its purchase and restoration it had become all but a hopeless wreck .

		Thirteen ; hundred pounds and more from the publie-spirited
Chicago	LOCATION	man 's pocket , and intelligent supervision on the part of the no less public-spirited authoress , secured the honse and put it practically into the same condition as when little
John Harvard	PERSON	whipped his top -LRB- if boys whipped tops in those days -RRB- before its ' door .

		To
Harvard Universitj	ORGANIZATION	- , as was right and fit - ' ting , the rehabilitated structure was then made over : and henceforth American tourists will have another excellent motive for visiting the town of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		This tribute to the memoij of the founder ^ 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, of our oldest university came late , as did the granite monument over his grave in
Charlestown	LOCATION	, which was not erected till he had been dead one hundred and ninety years ... The author of forty novels , Mrs.
Mary Jane Holmes	PERSON	, leaves a multitude of readers to mourn her loss .

		The estimated sale of her mildly sensational love stories -- beginning with ' • Tempest and Sun - shine , '' published in
1854	DATE	when
Mary Jane Hawes	PERSON	was still in her ` teens -- is something over two mil - lions of copies .

		She continued to write nearly to the last , and her books , which number nearly forty , com - peted successfully with the more loudly heralded productions of the younger school of writers .

		Though leading a happy domestic life with her husband ,
Daniel Holmes	PERSON	, a lawyer , she had no children except the offspring of her fertile brain ; and that had been productive ever since she was fifteen years old , when she entered the literary field through the modest gate of the country newspaper .

		Her later contribu - tions to periodicals , in tlie shape of essays and criti - cisms and good counsels , were numerous .

		Interesting to the student of heredity is her relationship to the once noted Congi'egational preacher and writer of
Hartford	LOCATION	, Rev. Dr.
Joel Hawes	PERSON	, her uncle , who with her parents .


New England	LOCATION	farming folk of literary and artistic tastes , exerted considerable influence on her thoughts and studies .

		That hers was a pre - cocious intellect is shown by the fact that at thirteen she was teaching school , and at fifteen , as above noted , writing for publication .

		The intellectual life , however , is on the wliole the life of health and endur - ance , and she nearly attained the scripturally allotted length of days .

		Her stories had a pleasantly domestic atmosphere , and she was , as fiction-writers go , a safe entertainer to her large class of readers , the majority of whom were women and girls .

		• • • Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	's translations from the German have long been recognized as contributions to English literature .

		Librarians and booksellers find that these romances are almost invariably called for as Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	's books , not as
E. Marlitt	ORGANIZATION	's , or
Werner	PERSON	's , or Prau von HilJern 's .

		This involuntary and inevitable ascription of authorship to the trans - lator is without a parallel .

		No one ever thinks of crediting
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	with
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's works , or Miss Hapgood or Mr.
Dole	PERSON	with
Tolstoy 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
A. L. A.	PERSON	'' Catalog of 5000 Volumes for a Popu - lar Library '' Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	's name appears , in its proper alphabetical place , at the head of her trans - lations -- or such of them as are included in the selected library ; but no other translator is similarly honored .

		About fifteen years ago , when what was expected to be the last of her books made its appear - ance , she excused herself from further labors of the sort on the plea that the daughter of her father -LRB- the late
William H. Furness	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	-RRB- and the sister of her brother -LRB- Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	-RRB- ought to be engaged in worthier work than translating German love stories for American girls to read .

		But she has at last broken her vow -- if this perhaps playful utterance of the writer can be called a vow -- and her publishers are about to issue still another translation of hers , from the German of
Adolpli Streckfuss	PERSON	, entitled `` The Lonely House . ''

		the pre - paration of wliich has probably been to Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	a pleasant change from the Shakespearian researches in which she has of late years been aiding her brother .

		... Muscular librarianship , like muscular
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , ought to be the kind peculiarly suited to this strenuous era . ''

		No mollycoddles need apply '' might appropriately be appended to an advertisement for a public librarian .

		It may be with a view to some such future physical requirements as are here hinted at that the library workers of
England	LOCATION	are now developing their brachial and crural muscles at cricket .

		An English periodical , unassuming in size and in title -LRB- it calls itself '' The Library Assistant '' -RRB- reports that '' the return match between library assistants north of the Thames and assistants south of the Thames was played at
Regent	ORGANIZATION	's Park on
Aug. 28	DATE	.

		The South Side was again successful , obtaining 64 runs as against 39 scored by the North .

		A full report of the game will appear next month . ''

		The time may come -- though we confess we are not eagerly awaiting its advent -- when '' The Library Journal '' or '' Public Libraries '' will give detailed reports of close and exciting ten-innings games between
the Cleveland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	nine and the
Detroit Public Library	ORGANIZATION	nine , or of fierce struggles on tlie gridiron between the Carnegies of
Pittsburg	LOCATION	and the
John Crerars	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The curious part of all this is that
America	LOCATION	has allowed herself to be anticipated in this new movement , whereas hitherto she has taken the lead in all branches of library science .

		... The rehabilitation of French literature in the eyes of the American reading public is urged by
M. Hugues Le Roux	PERSON	.

		He suggests the establish - ment in
New York	LOCATION	of a large depot for the sale of the best , and only the best .

		French books , all objec - tionable yellow-backs to be barred out .

		M.
Marcel Provost	ORGANIZATION	would have a similar warehouse opened in
London	LOCATION	.

		Still another French litterateur ,
M. Jules Claretie	PERSON	, is quoted as deploring that Americans form their notions of modern French literature from pornographic rubbish .

		Reference has already been made to the step lately taken by a prominent English publishing house in issuing novels from across the Channel in sober and respectable cloth binding .

		With all these well-meant endeavors Gallic literature ought to be able to hold up its head in foreign lands .

		• `` • Japanese women of letters are no new twentieth-century development in the
Island King	LOCATION	- dom .

		In an ancient anthology of the
Nara	LOCATION	period , or eighth century of our era , there are quotations from writers of the gentle sex ; and their delicacy of sentiment and artistic conmiand of the language are adjudged of superior merit .

		The male authors make a poor showing in comparison .

		The QrEEX of thk Fbexch Stage .

		* In the • ' personal , professional , and social recol - lections as woman an.l artist '' of the greatest living French actress , one is not surprised to find the domesric reoollefctions as wife and mother placing no part whatever .

		So identi - fied Is ^ Ime .


Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	with her art and her ambitions that no one ever thinks of her as the widow
Damala	PERSON	, and few remember that she has enjoyed the pleasures -- if they were pleas - ures to her -- of maternity .

		Hence it is that in her very characteristic and brightly enter - taining memoirs we have on every page the
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	of the stage , the eccentric and versatile woman of genius , very much as she is already known to the world .

		With a reticenc-e not unusual in autobiog - raphies of women Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	omits to mention the date of her birth ; but as she after - ward speaks of herself as a young woman of twenty-four at the time of the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, one can make a shrewd guess at the year when she was bom .

		It is worth notins that her mother was but sixteen jears old when she gave birth to this child of genius -- worth noting becatise it has been lately ascertained that men and women of genius are as a rule the late-bom children of their parents .

		From infancy the little
Sarah	PERSON	, by her own showing , had all the qualities of wilfulness , impulsiveness , nervous - ness , and uncontrollabilitj - .

		that have marked her maturely developed character .

		Let us quote one characteristic incident of childhood , which is related in the course of a description of her theatrical debut at the Comedie Fran - caise , when two veterans of the stage showed her especial kindness . ''

		Both men had been moved by the same sentiiiient of protection for the poor , fragile , nervous girl , who was , nevertheless , so full of hope .

		Both of them knew my leal for work , my obstinate will , which was always struggling for victtny over my physical weakness .

		They knew that my device ' Quan d m ime ' had not been adopted by me merely by chance , but that it was the outcome of a drfiberate exercise of will power on my part .

		My mother had told me how I had chosen this device at the age of nine , after a formidable jump over a dit ^ h which no one could jump , and whii-b my young cousin had dared me to attempt .

		I had hurt my face , broken my wrist , and was in pain all over .

		While I was being carried home I exclaimed furiously : ' Yes , I would do it again , gtUBid-mane , if any one dared me again .

		evening of that day .

		my aunt , who was grieved to see me in such pain , asked me what would give me ainr pleasure .

		My poor little body was all bandaged , hot I jumped with joy at this , and quite eonsoled I wfai ^ > eied m a coaxing way : ' I should like to have some writing paper with a motto of my own .

		* My mother asked me rather slyly what my motto was .

		I did not answer for a minute , and then , as they were all waiting quietly , I uttered such a furious ' Quand-mieme ' that my Aunt
Faure	PERSON	started back muttering , ' What a terriUe child ! ' '

		* In a rapid , lively style the writer narrates her childish joys and woes , ^ ^ ctories and defeats , at boarding-school and convent , where her rather scanty education -LRB- imder pedagogic supervision -RRB- was obtained , and where she seems to have lived up to her reputation of '' a terrible child . ' ''

		And yet she must even then have been attractive and interesting , for she was hardly more than a child when she received an offer of marriage from a rich tanner who enjoyed an income of sixty thousand francs and offered to settle a fortune of a half million on his young bride .

		This half million , or any part of it .

		she was to be at liberty to make over to her mother , then a widow , if she chose ; and if she refused him the tanner assured her that he should die of despair .

		Yet she did refuse him , choosing art for her brid ^ room instead , and he found conso - laticm elsewhere .

		After a course of study at the Conser \ - atoire
Nationale de Musique et de Declamation	ORGANIZATION	, the gifted young woman -- for her histrionic talent was speedly recognized -- received an invitation to join the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	: and here she made her first public appearance as actress .

		Some of the press comments on those early performances of hers are interesting to read now after the lapse of almost half a century .

		Here are a few chosen at random , and as quoted in the book . ''

Bernhardt	PERSON	, who made her d ^ bat yesterday in the role of Ipkigenie , is a tall , -LCB- H ^ tty girl with a slender figure and a very pleasing expression , the upper part of her face is remarkably beautifuL She holds hersdf well , and her enunciation is perfectly clear .

		This is all that can be said for her at present . '' ''

		The same evening ' Les
Fenunes Stivantes	PERSON	' was given .

		This was Mile .

		Bemhaidt 's third appea r ance , and she took the role of HenrieUe .

		She was just as pretty and insignificant in this as in that of Junie -LRB- he had made a mistake , as it was IpUgenie I had played -RRB- and of
Valerie	PERSON	, both of which loloi had been entrusted to her previously .

		This performance was a Tery poor affair , and gives rise to reflections by no means gay ... The pitiful part is , though , that the comedians playing with her were not much better than she was , and they are Socielaireg of the Th ^ tre Fran ^ ais .

		All that they had more than their young comrade was a greater familiarity with the boards .

		They are just as Mile .

		Bernhardt may be in twenty years ' time , if she stays at the Comedie Francaise . ''

		280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, '' Mile .


Sarah Beniliardt	PERSON	appeared wearing an eccen - tric costume , which increased the tumult , but her rich voice -- that astonishing voice of hers -- appealed to the public , and she charmed them like a little Orpheus . ''

		As the wi'iter confesses in a later chapter , she '' had a continual thirst for what was new '' ; and therefore her sudden changes from one theatre to another , or from the stage to private life , and back again , need not surprise us .

		Her '' matl prank '' of a seemingly motiveless trip to
Spain	LOCATION	, without telling her mother and sisters of her project , was only one of many impulsive acts of her young womanhood .

		Her intense interest in the fortunes of the French armies in the war with
Prussia	LOCATION	, and her anguish over their defeat , reduced her to a condition in which for three days she was '' between life and death . ''

		On hearing of the enemy 's triumph at Sedan , she was utterly prostrated . ''

		The blood rushed to my head , '' she says , in language that might perhaps astonish a physician , '' and my lungs were too weak to control it .

		I lay back on my piUow , and the blood escaped through my lips with the groans of my whole being . ''

		She turned the
Odeon	LOCATION	, where she hatl been playing , into a military hospital , and seems to have acted very energetically the part of chief nurse .

		With equal vehemence , a few years later , she threw herself into the perilous amuse - ment of ballooning . ''

		I adored and I still adore balloons , '' she gushmgly declares , and then enlivens her narrative with a graphic account of a balloon ascension in which she reached a height that made breathing difficult and caused other bodily discomfort .

		But queerest of all queer things was her practice of studying her parts and of sleeping in her coffin . ''

		My bedroom was very tiny .

		The big bamboo bed took up all the room .

		In front of the window was my coffin , where I frequently installed myself to learn my parts .

		Therefore when I took my sister to my home I found it quite natural to sleep every night in this little bed of white satm which was to be my last couch , and to put my sister in the big bamboo bed under the lace hangings ... Three days after this new arrangement my manicure came into the room to do my hands and my sister asked her to enter quietly because I was still asleep .

		The woman turned her head , believing that I was asleep in the armchair , but seeing me in my coffin she rushed away , shrieking wildly .

		From that ■ moment all
Paris	LOCATION	knew that I slept in my coffin , and gossip with its thistle-down wings took flight in all directions . ''

		A picture -- and a very pretty one it is , too -- is given of the fair sleeper in her satin-lined coffin , her hands crossed on her bos -LRB- -RRB- m , and her white robe sprinkled with flowers .

		In opening the chapter on her
London	LOCATION	debut , the writer says , '' I had never been on the sea when it was decided that the artistes of the
Comedie Francjaise	ORGANIZATION	should go to
London	LOCATION	. ''

		But she forgets that matl scamper into
Spain	LOCATION	, when she journeyed by coasting vessel from
Marseilles	LOCATION	to
Alicante	LOCATION	, '' six days of rough sea . '

		Consid - erable space is given to the American tour of
1880	DATE	, with which the book ends .

		As a final quotation a few passages descriptive of
Chicago	LOCATION	, as the visiting French actress saw it , may be of interest . ''

		I went to the
Palmer House	ORGANIZATION	, one of the most mag - nificent hotels of that day , whose proprietor , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	, was a perfect gentleman , coiu ` teous , kind , and generous , for he filled the immense apartment I occupied with the rarest flowers , and taxed his ingenuity in order to have me served in the French style , a rare thing at that time . ''

		We were to remain a fortnight in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Our success exceeded all expectations .

		This fortnight at
Chicago	LOCATION	seemed to me the most agreeable days I had had since my arrival in
America	LOCATION	.

		First of all there was the vitality of the city iu which men pass each other without ever stopping , with knitted brows , with one thought in mind , ' the end to attain . '

		They move on and on , never turning for a cry or prudent warning .

		What takes place behind them matters little .

		They do not wish to know why a cry was raised ; and they have no time to be prudent , ' the end to attain ' awaits them ... '' On the day of my last performance , a magnificent collar of camellias in diamonds was handed me on behalf of the ladies of

		* The history of the South since the war is summed up in the two volumes of the Lee-Thorpe series , by Messrs.
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Bruce	PERSON	.

		Both ; authors , writing with ease of stjle and breadth of view , have produced readable books .

		In the work of Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	there is a commendable absence of pettj - detail .

		In Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's volume at times the statistical matter becomes monoto - nous ; however , it is possible for the reader to omit much of this and confine his attention to the valuable comments and interpretation of the author .

		There is probably no greater contrast in historj ' than that shown by the accounts given by these two ^ vriters respectively of the most !

		impleasant period in our national life and of the succeeding most LnspLring one .

		The Reconstruc - tion period has few hopeful signs ; the succeeding ; period has few that are not ho -RSB- > efid .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's volume treats mainly of Reconstruction in the South , only one chapter being devoted to affairs at the North .

		Other chapters deal with the usual topics -- the South after the war .

		Lincoln 's and
Johnson	PERSON	's plans and acts , the Freedmen , ^ lilitai'V
Government	ORGANIZATION	, Impeachment of the President , Congressional Reconstruction ,
Carpet-bag Government	ORGANIZATION	,
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	, and the end of Reconstruction .

		One distinctively original chapter is devoted to a study of the race tendencies of the negroes and whites .

		Throughout the work , emphasis is laid upon the importance of the negro factor in the Reconstruction conti-oversies , and an effort is made to give an intelligible account of just what the race question meant .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	says but little of economic conditions , and not much of the social disorder that existed during this period ; these matters are briefly disposed of in Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's succeeding volume .

		The omission leaves the Reconstruction account largely a political one , though there is a chapter on Religious Conditions , with some caref id summaries of the Fetlei-al labor regidations for the negroes .

		black secret political societies --
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	and
Union League	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is one general criticism that may be made of Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's volume : on some matters he writes his history too much from laws and official regulations .

		Now , Recon - struction laws , especially carpet-bag laws and Freedmen 's Bureau regulations , can not always be taken at their face value .

		Much interpreta - tion and explanation is necessary .

		The author following the letter is led to ascribe much importance to the Reconstruction laws as a nationalizing force .

		This is a purely legal ^ ^ ew , and is superficial .

		People are not made into a nation by law ; certainly the Southern people were provincial much longer because of those laws .

		This legal habit of mind also leads the author , in writing of the Civil War , to adopt the use of such terms as rebel , rebellion , treason , etc. , a use no longer considered histori - cal .

		One or two other points may be criticised : it is not likely that the Noi-th
Carolina Union	LOCATION	- ists cared much for the negroes -LRB- p. 141 -RRB- , -- such was not the custom of Southern unionists : it is hardly worth while to say that the native whites might have controlled the blacks in Reconstruction , for the Reconstruction plans themselves practically prevented that , and the Freedmen 's
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	and the
Union League	ORGANIZATION	did the re.st ; also , in neglecting to some extent social matters the author does not offer adequate explanation for the irritation of the whites imder the Reconstruction government .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's book has but one chapter about political matters .

		More than half the space is given to a statistical accoimt of the constantly increased output from Southern farm , forest , sea , mine , and factory .

		One chapter discusses the growth of cities suice the war , and another the increase of imports and exports .

		That Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	is a master of an enormous fund of economic information is pi * oved by his two chap - ters on Southern financial matters and trans - portation facilities .

		These chapters , and those on etlucation and literature , population , and social and political tendencies , make up the most original part of the work , the first half being mainly a summary from the census and other official publications .

		The story of progress in the South as told b -RCB- - Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	is mainly the story of the advance of the white districts -- those r ^ ons kept back before the Civil War by the institution of slavery .

		Most of this progress had been made since
1880	DATE	, the transition period from
1865	DATE	to
1880	DATE	being one of doubt as to whether the ^ 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, white districts or the black would dominate industrially .

		The failure of free negro labor in the fertile Black Belt has finally given to the poorer whites their opportunity , and good use they are making of it .

		The leading whites have since the war gone from the Black Belt plantations to run the railroads , banks , mines , and factories of the white districts .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	asserts that the i -RRB- lantations of the Black Belt are breaking up into small farms , -- a statement true for most of the Upper South , but not for the heart of the old slave districts in the Lower South .

		There immense plantations have been and are being formed .

		A hundred small truck farms near Mobile do not offset the forty square mUe plantation recently formed in the
Alabama Black Belt	LOCATION	.

		In his treatment of social matters , it is seen that the author holds to the caste theory of ante - bellum society , a theory that will not do for the newer states of the South .

		This tradition of a class system is fast becoming a fetich , espe - cially among the '' professional Southerners '' who live upon a past that never existed .

		Of educational conditions since
1865	DATE	, Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	gives a good account .

		Here , however , he falls into the same error that Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	makes in attaching too much importance to laws .

		The carpet-bag educational system for
Louisiana	LOCATION	did no more to found the school - system in
Louisiana	LOCATION	than
John Locke	PERSON	's Funda - mental Constitutions did to establish a titled nobility in
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		As the author himself shows very clearly , school systems in the South were developed only as popidation became dense enough to support schools .

		In many places in the South it will be long years before schools can be maintained with any degree of success .

		It is the reviewer 's opinion that Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's explanation of the South 's lack of a literature is inadequate .

		He says it was because there was no `` literary centre . ''

		But the causes of this lack lie deeper .

		Why was there no literary centre ?

		The answer is obvious to those who study the nature of ante-bellum intellectual activity .

		Both Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	and Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	seem to think that certain work in the South can be done safely only by negroes , -- the old ante - bellum notion .

		But the industrial progress of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	whites since the war has proved that there is but one place where whites can not work -LRB- the coast of
South Carolina	LOCATION	-RRB- , and no work that whites can not do and do better than blacks .

		Some Black Belt planters , however , will still assert that only a negro can make a cotton crop ; and yet within ten miles of them will be whites producing more cotton per capita than is made on the best Black Belt plantation .

		The old beliefs about the influence of climate upon whites have lasted a long time , in spite of hard knocks .

		In summing up , Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	says that there are certain influences more powerful than all others in advancing the prosperity of the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		`` These influences
spring	DATE	from the subdivision of lands : the diversifica - tion of agi-iculture ; the growth of manufac - tures ; the extension and control of railroads ; the spread of education : the more rapid expan - sion of the white than of the black popidation ; and finally the restriction of suffrage .

		In these seven facts of supreme importance is to be found the very kernel of all that the Southern people have accomplished since the abolition of slavery ; they are the foundation stones on which the superstructure of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	material greatness is fast rising . ''

		* '' Plays of our Forefathers '' is the not alto - gether fortunate title of a volume by
Professor Charles Mills Gayley of the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet it is due rather to our language than to any fault of the author that the title does not give a clearer hint of the content of the book .

		Had we the German word fJrahuen it woidd fit the case exactly ; for Professor Gayley deals with the beginnings of the modern drama .

		Like the classic tragedy of antiquity , the modern drama has its roots in things religious .

Greece	LOCATION	into the masterpieces of a Sophocles , find their first expression among the untutored barbarian invaders of

		The story of the outgi'owth of the liturgical plays from the Easter trope , and their gradual development through the Christmas and the Advent tropes , not only into a world cyclus but back to the fall of Lucifer and forward to the last Judgment , is not , to be sure , new ; it has , however , never been • PLAys OP OUR Forefathers .

TELE	ORGANIZATION	DIAL 283 presented with more compelling interest .

		With admirable clearness the author also ti-aces the development of the hmnorous from the appear - ance of Balaam and his ass in the procession of the prophets .

		Whatever of pagan survival may linger in the festival of the ass , his appeai-ance within the church doors turned each event with which he could Ije connected into burlesque .

		The festival of fools also grew out of the liturgy , though doubtless it owes elements to the Roman festival of the New Year ; but the humorous element once introduced , it was bound to pre - vail , and ended by banishing itself , as well as the serious liturgical drama , from the church .

		The author sketches the transition from church to guild , and devotes the longer and more important part of his volume to a study of the English cycles of miracle plays and moralities .

		Their collective story , the manner of their pre - sentation , the historical order of the various cycles , their dramatic development , and the introduction of romance and aUegorj ' .

		are some of the subjects taken up and accorded scholarly treatment .

		The volume is admirably Ulusti-atetl with well chosen reproductions from numerous sources , old cuts , manuscripts , and monuments each furnishing something .

		In his preface .

		Professor
Grayley	PERSON	says ; '' I have hoped that the reatling public might be interested in the mediaeval drama , not only as an instance in the development of literaiy art , but as a chronicle of the ideals and traditions , the religious consciousness , the romance and humour of times that seem to be remote , but after all are modern in a myriad surprising ways , and human to the core .

		To laugh and weep , to worship and to revel for a season , in the manner and spirit of our ancestors , were infinitely more pleasing than the pride of con - troversy or the pursuit of scientific ends . ''

		Thus his own is perliaps the best characterization of his work .

		He has a rare power of imparting life and human interest to matter that in hands less skilful either overwhelms or wearies the reader .

		He makes us feel that the men who foimd edification and amusement in these plays were , after all , much like ourselves .

		He brings home his facts occasionally by a reference that is startlingly modern : for example , in describ - ing a miracle of Saint
Nicholas	PERSON	, who restored to life three murdered boys whose bodies had l > een cut into pieces and salted as pork , he remarks : '' This was before the days of tinned meats ; but the methods of the packing-houses were , even then , not above suspicion . ''

		Pos - sibly it is imfair to the author to cite this !

		passage ; it might convey the idea of a prevail - I ing tone of burlesc ^ ue , and nothing is further from the truth .

		The fact is simply that Pro- fessor Gayley can not deal with any subject without imparting to it something of the viva - ' city and wit that are a part of his nature , lending to even the didlest detail the feeling that , though now possessing only antiquarian I or historical interest , it belonged in its time to i the vital issues of the day .

		To the customs and forms of our period he often gives a new interest by showing that they can really claim a stately ancestry ; thus , the modem vaudeville '' stunt '' claims as its remote and forgotten progenitor the sermon joyeux that grew out of !

		ecclesiastical burlesques in
France	LOCATION	.

		The sug - I gestion , too , that many a fool 's soliloquy in the ' Elizabethan drama may be traced to the same source , is not only probable but may explain !

		the sophistical nonsense and parodied scholas - ticism of many such passages .

		Indeed , the whole chapter on '' Secular By-Products in Satire and Wonder '' is of special interest .

		The choice of the term '' By-Products '' is another illustration of the modernity of Professor Gay - ley 's thought .

		His book is not only one to be commended to the scholar but to be enjoyed by the general readier .

		The most recent of the many works dealing with this material is entitled ''
The Great Plains	LOCATION	, a
Romance of Western Exploration	ORGANIZATION	, Warfare , and Settlement , '' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	has shown in previous publications , in both fact and fiction , his knowledge of the re - gions beyond the AUeghenies .

		The present effort lies in the category of his '' Historic Illinois . ''

		It is history in a lighter vein ; history adapted to general reading .

		It makes no pretence to a source basis ; it is not free from minor inac - curacies ; it ha.s little attraction for the close student ; it bars footnote references ; and it col - lects the authorities in a brief `` note of acknowl - edgement '' following the Introduction .

		This list of authorities includes for the most part neither official document nor original narrative , but secondary descriptions like those of
Hough	LOCATION	,
Chittenden	LOCATION	,
Inman	LOCATION	,
Bowles	PERSON	,
Richardson	PERSON	, and
Lummis	LOCATION	.

		Mingled with these , however , will be found occasional excerpts from more serious writers -- from
Castenada	PERSON	's Journal , from
H. H. Bancroft	PERSON	, and from
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		The volimie is best described as a collection of border stories and traditions , with running commentaries on contemporary conditions from the Spanish exploration to about
1870	DATE	.

		The choice of material is commendable , the weaving skilful , and the interest well sustained .

		The excellent characterization of stages of Western development may be judged from the following extract , which is the concluding paragraph of the book . ''

		It was a long , toilsome , aud perilous jouniey , from that f ar-otf time when Cabega de Vaea made his solitary pilgrimage amid his ' hump-backed oxen ' to the time of the invasion by Anglo-Saxon civilization .

		For thi-ee hundred and forty-three yeai 's , those vast green Plains had been the scenes of struggle ; the sun of
midday	TIME	and the stars of
midnight	TIME	had watched the slow transfor - mation .

		The marching of troops under three banners ; the desperate battles amidst the dreary buttes ; the slow , sullen retreat of savagery ; the stern advance of silent , persistent frontiersmen ; the slow rolling cara - vans piercing the wilderness ; the daring riders spurring their horses across the wide Plain ; the victim sobbing in torture ; the lost traveller praying in famine ; the white , dead faces upturned to the pitiless sky , -- all that had been and gone .

		And then , out of the
East	LOCATION	, they came to take possession ; over the long miles , across the rivers and the prairies , eame the conquering Anglo-Saxons -- men , women , children -- armed with the plough and the spade , animated by the dogged resolution which is the inheritance of their race , thrilling to the thought of home and to the passion of possession .

		The hour and the man had come ; the
Great American Desert	LOCATION	was a thing of the past .

		Le
Roi	PERSON	est mart ; vive le Roi ! ''

		The material chosen by Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	falls naturally into three groups : the exploration of the
Great Plains	LOCATION	, the struggle for their posses - sion , and their occupation and settlement .

		In the first group appear
Coronado	PERSON	and his Spanish fellow-explorers ,
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, the fm -- traders , and the
Santa	LOCATION	Fe trailers .

		The second division embraces the stage coach , the pony express , and the border warfare following the Civil War down to
1870	DATE	.

		Under the third head come the struggle for

Pacific	LOCATION	railroads , mushroom towns , outlaws , and scouts .

		The volume has some spirited and interesting illustrations , presumably reproduc - tions , for the most part , from some older work .

		His new book will meet a welcome from all who wish to know the present conditions and future prob - lems of

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, being a thorough-going English - man , seems haunted by a fear that

Tennyson	PERSON	's reference to a '' cycle of Cathay , '' so that a subject of the Mikado may exclaim , '' Better fifty years of

		In much the same way , British wiseacres of the last century talked about the
United States of America	ORGANIZATION	, which threw away thrones , kings , political churches , religious persecution , entail , and feu - dal I ` elics generally .

		However , toward the end of his work Mr.
Watson	PERSON	relieves us of our fears by showing that while

		But he does not seem to know that new workers have come into the field , both with the spade and with investigations among the Ainu -- the white men who first inhabited the whole archipelago , and that Japanese history has been virtually recon - structed within the last half - decade .

		ilr .


W. G. Aston	PERSON	, pioneer , veteran , scholar , and translator of the Nihongi -LRB- a. d. 720 -RRB- , has shown that Mr.
Heam	PERSON	was entirely wrong in suppasing that ancestor-worship existed in prim - itive
Japan	LOCATION	.

		On page 8 of his just issued * ' Shinto , the Ancient Religion of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	1907 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Aston	PERSON	shows that so far from • • Shinto or Ancestor-worship '' ' being the creed of the ancient inhabitants , as held by ilr .

		Heam and followed all the way through by Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, such a notion is utterly without founda - tion and against the facts , ilr .

		Aston declares that the last and most valuable work of Mr.
Heam	PERSON	, • •
Japan	LOCATION	, an Interpretation , '' is greatly marred by this misconception .

		Dr.
G. W. Knox	PERSON	, in his truly scientific book , • •
The Development of Religion	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' points out the same serious blunder into which foreign writers have fallen , following uncritic ^ al native ones by whom the allied ancestor-worship is orthodoxy sub po ` na .

		As the ancient records show , ancestor - worship is imknown to the genuine early records , and was borrowed from the Chinese .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	, the worship of ancestors is a mediaeval production and a comparatively modem devel - opment .

		A more intimate acquaintance with the origins of the Japanese , who are a verj - mixed people , would have given a different form and spirit to the whole forecast of the future of the Japanese , as set forth in this book .

		If the author had learned from original sources the actual work - ings of the Japanese mind , and if he were more familiar with the inner movements of contem - porary Christian thought , with the details of missionary education and the lives of native preachers and Christian scholars , -- and , in general , with the great transforming forces evi - dent in the press , the literature , and the life of the nation , especially since the outbreak of the war with
Russia	LOCATION	, -- his opinions might have been quite different .

		It is doubtful if he would then have seen in the Japanese either a '' Mon - golian '' nation or an essentially '' Oriental '' people : still less would he have held that the intellect of the nation is dominated by ancestor - worship .

		The former homogeneous and earnest hotly of poor stu - dentSf `` who , under the sternest rules , were all fitting for one of the four learned or Latin professions .

		... When they have asked us for some - thing that will make them successful and cultured bread - winners , we have gpiven them an ill-assorted , ill-begotten college course that is ' neither fish nor flesh , nor good red herring . '

		... We have put most of onr sentiment and money into the greatness of the institution , to the neglect of pre - paring each man for his future '' -LRB- pp. 88-89 -RRB- .

		The decay of true university ideals , particularly the ideal of scholarship , is declared to be a result of the lack of individual training .

		In this connec - tion the author refers largely to the report of the
Committee on Improving Instruction	ORGANIZATION	in
Harvard Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege ; four times in this report the committee refers to the feeling on the part of the students that proper means are not taken to `` keep them up in their work . ''

		Mr.

		Concerning the abuses in athletics Mr.

		There is perhaps nothing really new in this part of his book , but the truth is declared so vigorously that one gets a new strength of impression . ''

		We spend scores of thousands of dollars upon athletes who really do not need further attention for their individual good , but should be encouraging their weaker brothere by working daily along with them '' -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- . ''

		These are merely fragmentary specimens of the great indictment which Mr.
Birdseye	PERSON	brings against the modern college .

		Let us hasten to say that he is no mere railing accuser .

		Himself a college graduate , he is in deepest sympathy with all the true ideals of higher education .

		From the athletic work , some features of which he condemns so unsparingly , he would have the college authorities learn a great les - son : the modern athletic coach is the one man who provides genuine individual training for the student . ''

		In the student 's opinion , the professional trainer has been the great problem-solver , and therefore he has been allowed to become dominant '' -LRB- p. 237 -RRB- .

		To his example the membei-s of the faculties are referred , for it is by his methods that they must succeed .

		One of the most interesting ideas of the book is the conception of the college fraternity as the main substitute for the home life and training provided by the earlier American college .

		Mr.
Birdseye	PERSON	is an enthusiastic Greek , and devotes to the fraternities not far from one-fourth of the whole book .

		`` What then , is the conclusion of the whole matter ! '

		Not idle regret , nor recrimination , nor carping criti - cism ; certainly not despair .

		The two words which indicate the means of solution are cooperation and devotion . ''

		The problem is great , inmiinent , wide - spreading , and will prove too vast for any one of us alone or for divided forces .

		No time must be lost : let home-making influences cooperate with pedagogic ; alumni with faculty and trustees ; pa - rents with all the others ; and one and all with the undergi-aduate '' -LRB- p. 381-82 -RRB- .

		Professor West 's book entitled `` American Lib - eral Education '' consists of six papers prepared for special occasions , dealing with the
American College and University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first paper is a report of
Princeton	LOCATION	's experiment with the tutorial system : there is , perhaps necessarily , so much theory in educational discussions that a report of an actual experiment is refreshing .

		Professor West 's verdict as to the experiment at
Princeton	LOCATION	is distinctively favor - able ; fortunately , he reports several definite results , which seem to demonstrate the good influence of the new system .

		First , the use of the
University Library	ORGANIZATION	by undergraduates increased ; and , more - over , the increase consisted mainly , not of light reading , but of books of history , philosophy , litera - ture , and science , -- books , as Professor West says , that ought to be the natural reading of a man who calls himself a student .

		In the second place , con - versation on the campus has changed its char - acter . ''

		Things intellectual are now in good form , if spoken of without affectation ... even tangents and cosines sometimes fly around the campus ... I fully believe there is coming the recoveiy of the lost art of conversation '' -LRB- pp. 22-23 -RRB- .

		Finally , the evenings at the
University	ORGANIZATION	have taken on a different character , -- more lights in the rooms , fewer stroll - ers , greater quietude . '

		• The atmosphere of study is brooding and settling over the old halls . ''

		The second paper , on the changing conception of the faculty in American universities , deals mainly with the relation of the faculty with the President , and concludes with the very rational proposal that the faculty should in general control the educational policy of the institution , but that the President should have the power to take any question for final settle - ment to the trustees or regents of the institution .

		In the third chapter , Professor West takes to task our standards of graduate work , finding that these standards are threatened just now by an unen - lightened specialization and a mania for publication , and as a result the publications are largely char - acterized by a sort of solemn pedantry .

		All this is doubtless so well known as to be almost trite , and yet so true and so important that we may well approve

		Would it not be well for some t `` n - didate for a doctor 's degree to make a study of doctors ' theses with a view to showing the utter futility of the great majority of them ?

		In the fourth paper the writer presents four perils which beset our system of liberal education .

		Here again the reader finds himself on very familiar ground .

		The first peril is commercialism , under which heading technical studies receive some criti - cism ; the second L '' * illiteracy -- in the sense of ignorance of good literature ; the third is '' the disposition to do the pleasant rather than the hard thing '' : and the fourth , the peril of confusion in College councils , particularly respecting pre .

		`` cribed and elective studies .

		Of the fifth paper , on the • • Length of the
College Course	ORGANIZATION	, '' no special mention seems necessary ; the sixth , on the
American College	ORGANIZATION	, was published for the
Paris Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, and its contents are not new to intelligent Americans .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	's recent book on ' • Growth and Education '' does not differ greatlj - in plan and gen - eral content from a considerable number of works on the physical development of the child : it comes , however , with rather unusual authority on account of the high scientific standing of the writer , and it is enriched by a broad view of the subject , and a certain warmth of treatment which adds greatly to the value of a book intended for teachers .

		There are several chapters of rather peculiar interest : that on '' Man in the Light of Evolution '' ' presents very , briefly and clearly certain facts of evolution which are essential to any safe thinking on educational subjects .

		In '' Hints irova Embrj-ologj - '' there are gathered in one brief chapter some things which every teacher needs to know and which the unin - itiated would find hard to glean from other avail - able sources .

		In the chapter on `` Mortality and Morbidity , '' Professor
Tyler	PERSON	shows very clearly that statistics of death-rate , to which much attention has been paid , are of less value to the educator and hygienist than the facts concerning the contraction of the diseases which lead to death , a thing which probably took place months or even years before the actual death .

		WhUe the book deals mainly with bodily growth and development , the writer is led naturally by his subject into the field of moral and inteUectnal culture .

		He recognizes the importance of character-forming agencies in all periods , but justly emphasizes the high school as the time of final determination .

		■ ' Is even the development of a literary , historic , or scientific taste the chief end of the hi ^ h school ?

		Is there somethin | ^ still higher , better suited to adolescent needs ?

		I believe that we will agree that the greatest homan need is complete devotion to the highest moral and religions ideals : and that character is formed early , at least in tendency .

		It usnally does not change essentially after the yonth is twenty years old .

		It will improve , grow and strengthen ; bnt the growth will be along lines already marked .

		In one word , character is formed in the high school and this is its period of most rapid development '' -LRB- pp. 193-4 -RRB- .

		The book contains a valuable appendix , including tables of growth and vital statistics , and an extensive bibliography .

		We recommend it heartily for the library of every teacher .

		The growth of imiversity departments of education and of professional training for secondary teachers has for some time called for suitable text-books , which have not hitherto been forthcoming .

		We now have a work from the hand of Professor De Garmo , which will be of value in this respect .

		This is the first of two volumes on '' The Principles of Secondary Education , '' and treats of - The Studies '' ; the second is to treat of '' Aims and Processes . ''

		What the present volume contains is briefly as follows : In the Introduction , the social basis and the individual basis of secondary education are discussed ; the social basis consists of the existing conditions of educational opportunity , and the consequent selection of the secondary pupils ; the individual basis is the character of the early adolescent , particularly his growing individuality , for which constant allowance must be made .

		Next , the studies of the secondary school are discussed , -- their selection , classification , and value ; and , finally , the organization of the studies into currinda .

		The book contains valuable appen - dices , consisting mainly of typical curricula , proposed and actual , the latter including both Ameriesm and foreign ty ^ pes , and characteristic modern forms such as manual training and conmiercial high schools .

		It is evident that such a systematic treatment by an authority so competent and respected as Professor De Garmo will be welcomed by students of education in
America	LOCATION	, and particularly by teachers of the prin - ciples of secomlary education , who will find the book invaluable as text-book and reference .

		The Introduction sets forth the Presuppositions imderlj-ing
American Secondary Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		We can not but feel that the score of pages devoted to this subject is too little ; upon the principles here laid down must rest the whole discussion of the selection and treatment of studies , as well as the doctrines of school organization and discipline .

		We could wish that the sociological ideas involved in the first section had been more thoroughly clarified and related to the theme ; it is hard to see how the social classifi - cation quoted from
Patten	PERSON	, of '' dinger , sensualist , stalwart , and mugwump '' -LRB- p. 7 -RRB- is connected with the problem of secondary education ; indeed , the whole classification strikes one as not merely '' fan - tastic nomenclature * ' but a fantastic idea - The author recognizes the fact that the secondary - school deals with selected groups ; but the fact that they are selected is of little significance unless we keep in mind to what end they are chosen and trained namely , for leadership .

		This dominant idea in all higher education , beginning with tlie high school , does not come into due prominence - We be - lieve that any true doctrine of the secondary school must be founded largely upon this idea ; both the studies and the discipline must recognize this ; every 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, pupil should grow into a consciousness , not of priv - ilege , but of duty , -- to think more clearly , act more wisely and strongly , and serve his day and genera - tion more fully , than his fellows who have been denied the higher training bestowed upon him .

		The second section of the Introduction deals with the individual basis ; that is , the nature of the adolescent period .

		The reader who shares the ten - dency of the times to consider this period extraor - dinary in character and preeminent in importance will be disappointed with the scanty eight pages here devoted to it , and that without mention of two of the most significant elements in the period -- the development of sex , and the rise of vocational im - pulses and ideas .

		To the student of the history of education since the
Revival of Learning	ORGANIZATION	, one of the momentous fact.s is the passing of Latin and Greek as the sole vehicle of knowledge and culture , and the rise of literature and science in the vernacular tongues .

		To liim , the keynote of a discussion concerning the value of the ancient languages in education may well be put in Professor De
Garmo	PERSON	's own words : '' The more a given group of studies is urged as a necessity in education , the more imperative becomes the need of determining its inherent worth , lest the tradi - tional estimate of its value be over or under rated '' -LRB- p. 103 -RRB- .

		We can not resist the conviction that the author has not lived up to this principle with respect to the study of foreign and especially ancient lan - guages in the secondary school .

		The reasons for this conviction can not be given here in full ; one fact is , however , suggestive : eighteen pages are devoted to linguistics , five to literature in general , one to literature in the mother tongue .

		Nor can we feel that this is an accident , but rather that it is indicative of the real attitude of the discussion .

		Truly , we have wandered far from the educational ideals of our spiritual ancestors the Greeks !

		The style is everywhere clear and readable , and the make-up of the book is satisfactory , in spite of a few typographical errors .

		One or two minor criticisms may be suggested : on page 129 we should surely read hundreds instead of '' thousands of years ago '' ; it is not clear why the OherreaZschule is omitted from the list of German secondary schools -LRB- p. 172 -RRB- ; is not `` many-sided attention '' a contra - diction in terras ?

		Doubtless many-sided interest is meant -LRB- p. 121 -RRB- .

		JSurope after the downfall of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		For the ordinary student , the period of the Restoration , coming after the tragic and spectacular collapse of the Napoleonic empire , seems fiUed with dreary details of petty repression .

		A closer scrutiny has credited it with some distinguishing merits , -- the preserva - tion of peace for a half-century , so necessary for the restorative process in the higher sense of the word .

		Still more important was the silent administrative , industrial , and commercial revolution which was far advanced before the period ended .

		In the new vol - ume of the `` Cambridge Modern History '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- which treats The Restoration , these features are properly emphasized .

		This is especially true of the chapters on
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, by Professor Bourgeois and Professor
Pollard	PERSON	.

		Professor PoUard evidently believes that the work of administrative and commercial reform was , for the scattered prov - inces of
Prussia	LOCATION	, more essential than the g ^ ` ant of a parliamentary system of government .

		The vol - ume also contains a special chapter on '' Economic Change , '' but so much of positive fact is crowded into its thirty-five pages as nearly to smother definite impressions .

		As in previous volumes of this series , foreigners have been called upon for contributions within their fields .

		In addition to Professor Bourgeois , there are Dr.
Askenazy	PERSON	for
Russia	LOCATION	and
Poland	LOCATION	, Professor Segi-fe for
Italy	LOCATION	, and Professor
Altamira	ORGANIZATION	for
Spain	LOCATION	.

		This diversity of authorship results occasionally in an embarrassing diversity of views .

		For example .

		Lady Blennerhasset writes that the policy of Consalvi '' impressed upon the Papal restoration a stamp of high statesmanship and moderation , '' while Professor
Segre	PERSON	remarks that '' The Church had restored a government far more despotic -LSB- than that of the Aiistrians in
Lom	LOCATION	- bardy -RSB- , and rendered more destructive and oppres - sive by its internal confusion -- a blind , changeable and capricious government , '' etc. .

		Again , referring to the period after the commotions of
1830	DATE	, whUe Professor Segrfe characterizes
Louis Philippe	PERSON	's Italian policy as '' timid '' and '' uncertain , '' Profes - sor Bourgeois thinks the
Citizen King	ORGANIZATION	steered amidst the rocks of foreign intervention with consummate skill and foresight .

		In the present volume there are chapters which fill lacunae left in the two earlier volumes , notably the chapter of Mr.
Kirkpatrick	PERSON	on the Spanish Dominions in
America	LOCATION	, which intro - duces his chapter on the Establishment of Inde - pendence in
Spanish America	LOCATION	.

		The chapters on English and German literature also cover much of the eighteenth century .

		If there appears less unity in this volume , because there is no great central fig - ure or theme , it nevertheless possesses sound utility .

		Saint

		Undoubtedly this flavor of modernism , this bold mixture of the tragic and the comic , so marked in these * ' tragi-comedies . ''

		will appeal to the readers whom the monotonous solemnity of the classieal drama sometimes wearies .

		In his 135 page intro - duction , the editor has well brought out the char - acteristics of the two plays .

		The notes are extremely useful for the understanding of the style of the period , and as complete as could be desired : the bibliography covers all that is of prime importance on the subject .

		This edition of

		The author does not approach his subject with zeal for any cause he represented , nor with a spirit of eulogy , but gives a fair picture of the man in his strength of individual persistence and his weakness of impracticability .

		Large resea ^ ^ was neeessary to the eomfJete sketches the antlior gives of the various enterprises with which
Owen	PERSON	was connected , and this is shown also in the appended bibliography .

		Owen 's theories are deduced from his various writings and lectures , but not introduced in sufficient quantity to cause tediousness or distrac - tion .

		In short , the two volumes furnish an excellent example of what unbiased and tmprejudiced biog - raphy should be .

		Comparisons with modern prob - lems of child-labor and conditions of workingmen are inevitable in the reader 's mind , and modem improved conditions are appreciated when one reads that at New Lanark Owen found in his newly purchased cotton mills no less than five hundred children apprenticed from the parish workhouse .

		At the same time , one queries how modem work - men would take
Owen	PERSON	's method of hang ^ g beside each spinner a wooden paddle painted to show his conduct on the preceding day , -- t. c , white for '' excellent , '' yellow for '' good , '' blue for '' indif - ferent , '' and black for '' bad . ''

		There is no boasting , no attempt at self - glorification .

		Instead , there breathes throughout the spirit of lofty devotion to duty that made General

		We are shown something of the appalling horror of war as seen by the man in the ranks , but this is not dwelt upon unduly .

		The things brought into prominent relief are the intense patriotism of the army and the rela - tion that existed between officers and men , which we are told was exceedingly close and tender , and akjn to that between parents and children .

		Con - sidering the great difficulty of finding PInglish phrases to give the exact meaning of the original , the translation has been very well done , though occasionally the choice of words is not happy .

		No review of the work would be quite complete without some reference to the colored frontispiece , repro - duced from a drawing made by the author with his left hand after he had lost his right in the war .

		As might naturally be expected , there are some amusing errors of diction , as in the reference to works on the scenery of

		The navve acceptance of such legends as the simul - taneous formation of

		For the most part , however , the book is accurate and well suited to the needs of readers who do not care to go deeply into the subjects treated .

FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, and '' The Canticle of the Sun '' by
St. Francis of Assisi	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Adventures of Uncle
Sam	PERSON	's Soldiers '' ' is the title given to a new volume in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Adventure Series . ''

		There are a dozen stories , and among their authors are
Julian Ralph	PERSON	,
John Habberton	PERSON	, and Gen.
Charles King	PERSON	.

		A monograph on '' The JEsthetic Doctrine of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Edwin Preston Dargan	PERSON	, is pub - lished by the
J. H. Furst Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		It is a
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	doctoral dissertation of the normal type , and of something more than the normal interest .

		Professor
Earle W. Dow	PERSON	's '' Atlas of European History , '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a volume of moderate dimensions , and , of course , better than its predecessors because it embodies the latest political arrangements of
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The poems of the late
Richard Hovey	PERSON	are now pub - lished by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a neat set d ux volumes , five of which are devoted to the several parts of the dramatic cycle '' Laimcelot and Guenevere . ''

		The sixth volume is '' Along the Trail , '' a collection of vaga - bond lyrics .

		An edition of '' Grace Abounding '' and '' The Klgrim 's Progress , '' included in a single volume , is now added to the '' Cambridge English Classics , '' of which the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	are the American publishers .

		Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	has edited the text from the most complete editions .

		Dr.
Charles Seignobos	PERSON	's '' History of Medieval and of Modem Civilization , '' in a translation made by Professor
James Alton James	PERSON	, is pubhshed by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		This is the second of a series of three volumes which will reproduce , altogether , the essential parts of the author 's '' Histoire de la Civilisation . ''

		Miss
Laura #	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lockwood offers to the academic public a '' Lexicon to the English Poetical Works of
John Milton	PERSON	, '' the result of labors extending over a dozen years .

		The usefulness of such a work to literary students is so obvious that no comment is needed .

		The pages are double-coliunned , and there are nearly seven hundred of them .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, publish a '' Swedish Grammar and Reader , '' the work of Professor
J. S. Carlson	PERSON	.

		This is a book that has been much needed , and does for the student of Swedish what Professor
Juhus Olson	PERSON	's similar work does for the student of Norwegian .

		The selections which fill the `` reader '' section of the volume are judiciously made and of much interest .

		The Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, who , soon after the death of
Frederick Law Olmsted	ORGANIZATION	, had the good judgment to republish his narrative of '' A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States , '' have now continued the good work then begun by following it with a new edition of '' A Journey in the Back Country . ''

		This work , Uke its predecessor , fills two large volumes .

		It was originally issued in
1860	DATE	, and the experiences which it relates date six or seven years further back .

		As time goes on , these books will become more and more important to the historian , and it is safe to predict that the late twentieth century wUl think of them , and use them , as we now use and think of the books of
Arthur Young	PERSON	.

		n ^ HIS imposing work is issued in three sections of two volumes each .

		- * - The author is the leading historical writer in
Italy	LOCATION	at the present time .

		The translator is himself an authority on
Venice	LOCATION	, with the repu - tation of knowing more about
Venice	LOCATION	than any other living English - man .

		The volumes are distinguished typographically by being printed in the beautiful Italian type , cut by

		`` It is remarkable and hardly credible that so excellent a work should have waited so long for an English version ; and yet the delay has brought its compensations , for during all this time
Signor Mol	ORGANIZATION	- menti has been adding to his knowledge of his subject and to his book , so that he is now able to present the latest and in many cases the definitive statement .

		Moreover , the invention and the perfecting of process engraving have made it possible for the publishers of this work to illustrate it properly , at a cost which would not have been dreamed of earlier .

		And
Horatio Brown	PERSON	, himself / afzV ^ princeps among living British knowers , lovers , and historians of
Venice	LOCATION	, has been secured to put
Signor Molmenti	PERSON	's exuberant Italian into sound English prose .

		More than passing notice should be made of the illustrations of this work .

		They are chosen wisely to illustrate every part of the text , -- views of buildings , maps , facsimiles of draw - ings , half-tones of paintings and sculptures , and reproductions of illuminations .

		The work should appeal with equal force to the general reader and the specialist . ''

The Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		`` The new volumes deal with the Golden Age of this great commercial empire , every portion of the daily life of the Venetians , their government and their art being discussed with the authority that has won such high praise for the preceding part of the work .

		The typographical beauty of this book , ` with the admir - able binding and attention to mechanical details , adds a ivorthy chapter to the history of American publishing . ''

1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 299 THE CRIMSON CONQUEST | N his story , just published under the title of `` The Crimson Conquest , ''
Charles B. Hudson	PERSON	has utilized to the full the glamour and magnifi - cence of this to us almost mythical age .

		Since
Lew Wallace	PERSON	wrote '' The Fair God , '' novelists have neglected the romantic period of the Span - ish subjugation of the peoples of Central and
South America	LOCATION	.

		Few episodes in history offer more dramatic possibilities than the advent of
Pizarro	PERSON	's band of freebooters among the peace - ful tribes of
Peru	LOCATION	. ''

		This tale is of days when the green forest-aisles and mountain trails of
America	LOCATION	saw the glint of the steel of men in armor .

		It has to do with times when the abo - rigine looked upon the sparkle of lance , the flutter of pennon , the gleam of corselet , helm , and morion , and felt his primeval turf tremble beneath the hoofs of steeds in full panoply .

		It tells of plumed and plated cavaliers , who found in the wilderness of the New World adventures no less hardy , and near as strange , as any fabled one encountered by knight of old . ''

		The heroine is a daughter of that Inca of
Peru	LOCATION	whom
Pizarro	PERSON	so shamelessly did to death , and sister to his successor on the throne ; the hero , one of the bravest of
Pizarro	PERSON	's doughty following , a knight of
Castile	LOCATION	.

		`` Most remarkable is it , and doubly welcome , nhen the highest standard of excellence is approached by the first volume of one to fame unknown .

		To this dignity of precedence arises
Charles B. Hudson	PERSON	's ' The Crimson Conquest , ' a stately romance of the Incas at the zenith of their splendor .

		In intensity of interest he surpasses a famous predecessor in his field ,
Prescott	PERSON	, prince of chroniclers , for with the same fidelity to history ,
Hudson	PERSON	has redrawn the grim shapes of atrocities practiced upon the superstitious and practically defenceless Children of the Sun .

		but has intertwined with the piteously true detail of Castilian pillage and perfidy the love story of the Princess
Rava	PERSON	and the Spanish Captain , Cristoval .

		The treachery of his leader , by which the captive Inca Atahualpa was put to ignominious death after delivering the price of his promised freedom , made Cristoval an ally of the oppressed Peruvians .

		Assisted by
Pedro	PERSON	, the cook , he escaped the death penalty of sedition , rescued
Princess Rava	ORGANIZATION	from
Rogelio	LOCATION	, the wheedling Veedor , and effected an adventurous flight to sanctuary across the Andes . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 322 NOTES 322 LIST OF N'EW BOOKS 323 THE MASTERPIECES OF ENGLISH XARRATIVE VERSE .

		It has long been a thought of mine that a collec - tion should be made of the best specimens of English narrariTe verse , corresponding to the many anthol - ogies of lyric and ballad poetrj - .

		To do this adequately would require that some of the crown jewels of English literature should be torn from their settings -- that the epics and long poems should be dismembered .

		Sacrilege this , but perhaps the fragments would show to as much advantage in juxtaposition with rival pieces as they do in their present frameworks .

		Lyric poetry we have always with us .

		It is so much the natural language of the human heart , so much the necessary iiistnm -LSB- ient of personality , that one can not imagine it ever becoming unfashionable or obsolescent .

		The drama , too .

		holds its own , partly by help of the stage and partly by its own inherent virtue , as the most concentrated form by which action can be presented .

		We can not afford to neglect the drama of the past , though we may refuse to pay any attention to the plays of the present .

		But epic and narrative poetry have fallen upon evil days .

		They have suffered far more than the other two supreme forms of verse by the competition of the novel and the short story .

		Verse undoubtedly makes greater demands upon a reader than prose .

		To read a novel is as easy as to forget it .

		To read verse requires either an instinct or an education .

		But its stamp endures .

		It has form , where prose has merely force .

		It ha # architecttiral symmetry , sculpturesque outline , color , and music -- qualities which are only faintly present in prose .

		The vast increase of readers among the untrained and flabby-minded is respoA - sible for the present occultadon of portry .

		They follow the line of least resistance , and read what gives them the least trcmUe .

		And some of our chief American pro * emen , who ought to know better , take advantage of this condition and affect to speak super - ciliously of verse .

		They talk mysteriously of their '' new art , '' of the '' more subtle methods '' of their prose , and relegate the eternal forms of literature to the garret as outworn lumber .

		The casual observer can see no new art in their books , only an art as old as commonplace has always been , and a method as obvious as mediocrity has always used .

		It is hard to convince one that a photographic albimi of an ordinary American faniUy is a more valuable national possession than the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	or UflBzi gal - leries .

		It is not difBcult to cut off seventeen yards of pump-water and call it a novel , or to string together vague phrases and solemn puffery and call it an essay .

		Even the really great prose works of 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, our language have not the form of adamant and soul of fire of the great poems .

		The best of our novels , if brought into competition with '' Paradise Lost , '' would disappear like the serpents of the
Magi	ORGANIZATION	before
Aaron	PERSON	's animated rod .

		The best of our short stories would show like shadows beside the white enchant - ment of '' Christabel '' or the glowing splendor of `` The Eve of St. Agnes . ''

		A collection such as I suggest would have to begin with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		Langland 's ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	'' is , for any practical purpose , not English ; and Beowulf and the great Welsh and Irish legends and epics are not English at all .

		What poet better than
Chaucer	PERSON	for the fore-front of such a book ?

		The morning freshness , the
spring	DATE	vitality of his landscape , the lusty vigor and naturalness of his people , would open the collection with a thrill and tingle of life .

		The Prologue to the '' Canterbury Tales '' to show his humor and creative force , the '' Knight 's Tale , '' per - haps somewhat condensed , to show his romantic strain and the richness of his verse , and the '' Prioress 's Tale '' to show his pathos , would be my selections .

		English narrative verse leaps from Chaucer to
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, -- from the realist with romance in his blood , to the idealist touched with the love of the flesh and the adornments thereof .

		Spenser 's sen - suousness , however , is at second-hand ; it is the mirrored reflection of great galleries of pictures , rather than of the wide world itself .

		The opening canto of '' The FaSrie Queene , '' the canto describing the garden of
Acrasia	LOCATION	, and one dealing with
Britoraart	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's most brilliant heroine , would be a fair representation .

		The vast mass of Elizabethan verse would hardly yield more than one poem ,
Marlowe	PERSON	's '' Hero and Leander . ''

		It is a translation , but it has all the merits of an original , and it glows like a clear star amid the fogs and clouds of
Daniel	PERSON	,
Drayton	PERSON	, and the other epic writers of the time .

		Shakespeare 's two narrative pieces show the crescent might of the master 's hand , but they are encumbered and tire - some and altogether unable to hold their own with the work of the real story-tellers .

		Again there is a wide gap , until we come to
Milton	LOCATION	.

		I would choose the first four books of `` Paradise Lost , '' and should think it no irreverence to the great poet to tear them from their place .

		In the rest of the work we are moving in a high region ; but we are hardly conscious of the height , and we are conscious of many inequalities and dreary wastes .

		The first precipitous rising of the eternal peaks , the outlook over
Ulimitable	LOCATION	horizons , are lost to us .

		If nothing remained of the poem but the scenes in hell and the opening view of paradise , we would gaze in wonder on the unparallelled fragments and declare that the hand that wrought them was the mightiest in the history of literature .


Dryden	PERSON	's superb and manly genius hardly ever showed to greater advantage than in the Fables of his old age .

		Of these I should choose ''
Theodore	PERSON	and Honoria '' and '' Cymon and Iphigenia . ''

		I do not see how we could do without the whole of Pope 's '' Rape of the Lock , '' a work so brilliant in design and execution , so airy in invention , and so studded with glittering lines and passages , that it is mere pedantry to refuse it homage as a poem .

		Artificial it is , of course ; but it is Nature which makes that art , as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	assures us .

		Fops and bells , and powder-puffs and silver buckles , are all in the uni - versal round .

		The main force of eighteenth-century verse in
England	LOCATION	was diverted from the three primitive forms of poetry into satire , didactic and descriptive work .

		Great things were done in these , but not until the Romantic Revival came in sight did creative art in poetry again rear its head .

		Aside from his songs ,
Burns	PERSON	is a satiric and didactic writer .

		Only his `` Tam O'Shanter '' could be gathered into our casket .

		Wordsworth in the main is didactic and descriptive , yet he would yield us at least three narrative pieces -- ''
Michael	PERSON	, '' '' Hart-Leap Well , '' and ' * Laodamia . ''


Hazlitt	PERSON	gave his vote for two lines of the last-named piece as the best in the language .

		The whole poem is of solemn and ineffable beauty .

		Goethe 's '' Bride of
Corinth	LOCATION	, '' a piece far superior to
Wordsworth	PERSON	's in di-araatic effect and story-telling technique , is a mere fool to it in depth and compelling power .

		Coleridge 's '' Christabel '' and the '' Rime of the Ancient Mariner '' are two pinnacles of pure art .

		In them the absolute , the perfect simplicity of word and cadence , is substituted for style , and the mys - terious utterance of impassioned reverie for thought .

		Coleridge is the inspired bard , the true descendant of the Druids .

		I think there can be no doubt as to his original , though perhaps vague , plan for the completion of ''
Christabel	PERSON	. ''

		How could the child , the '' limber elf '' of the wonderful concluding lines , have got into the poem if he had no meaning ?

		Scott 's poetry is a good deal better than it gets credit for being .

		It is not made out of the original elements , as the poetry of Chaucer and
Burns	PERSON	is , -- at least those elements are fused and distilled in an alchemist 's retort , in the hope to get something finer than
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the product is healthful and invigorating .

		One might take from him the first canto of the '' Lay , '' the first canto of the '' Lady of the Lake , '' and the last canto of ''
Marmion	PERSON	. ''

		The great personality of Byron -- a volcano which spouted fire and ashes over
Europe	LOCATION	, whose track can be traced to this day -- required a personal form of expression .

		His greatest work is autobiographic or satiric .

		He did not take much interest in anybody but himself , and so was unfit for the drama or the epic .

		Yet '' The Vision of Judgment , '' while it is satire , is also magnificent narrative . ''

		The Prisoner of Chillon '' has a sombre gi'eatness , and the
Haid	PERSON	^ e book of ''
Don Juan	PERSON	'' is enchantingly beautiful .

		The
Northern Lights of Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's verse -- thin , wavering , unsubstantial -- did not concentrate into any solid epic creation .

		Probably his best narrative
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 work is the translation of the Homeric `` Hrnm to
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	, '' where the Greek original kept him within meAsnr & ble reach of reality . '

		^ Jnlian and Maddalo '' has fine lines and passages , and a brooding depth of tone . '

		• The Sensitive Plant '' is characteristically and entirely Shelleyan .

		The `` Hyjjerion '' of Keats seems to me the per - fect model of English narrative verse .

		Greek where
Milton	PERSON	is
Asiatic	LOCATION	, plastic where
Coleridge	PERSON	is vision - ary , manly where
Tennyson	PERSON	b feminine , he is , in mere manner , nearer than anvone else to the Ionian father of them alL His assimilative genius comes out in '' Lamia , '' where , adopting
Drvden	PERSON	's style , he far surpasses his master in originality of design and wealth of detail .

		`` The Pot of Basil '' is the most human of his poems , and • • The Eve of St Agnes '' the most complete exhibition of all the resooreeB of the poetic art .

		Never was the
Muse	PERSON	more decked and adorned , or more irradiated with inward light Our book ought `` to contain something bj -
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	and by
Moore	PERSON	, in the first case to show how far poetry can descend into prose -- herd swine like the Prodigal Son -- without forfeiting its birthright and in the second case to show how it can put on tinsel and false gauds without losii ^ its character for right virtue .

		One of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's - ` Tales of the
Hall	PERSON	' ■ would do : and .

		on the principle of taking a man 's most characteristic piece in this kind ,
Moore	PERSON	's '' Paradise and the Peri '' might be a good selection .

		It is sweetly prettj - anyhow .

		For various reasons ,
Blake	PERSON	,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and Tom Hood haidly seem to yield anj-thing to our purpose .

		I should g ^ ve a good part of Landor 's - Gebir , '' whose Laconism is a thing by itself in our literature .

		And I should include the first half of Home 's `` Orion , '' a poem which , though it echoes
Milton	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, holds itself not unworthily on a level with their best , and which has .

		besides , a spiritual individuality of its own .

		Arnold 's '' Sohrab and Rustum '' would complete this noble group of blank - verse poems .

		A collection such as is suggested would , bv bring - ing widely separated poems together , compel them to justify themselves .

		Each poet would be tried by a jury of his peers .

		The over-great reputation of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's narrative poetry would thus probably stand corrected .

		His sun would be shorn of some of its beams , ''
Maud	PERSON	, '' his best effort I should say , in creative art is hardly narrative , and could not be ad - mitted .

		The `` Morte D ''
Arthur	PERSON	, '' ''
Elaine	PERSON	, '' ``
Vivien	PERSON	. ''

		and • • Guinevere '' would have to he the selections .


Browning	PERSON	's magnificent `` Childe Roknd to the Dark Tower Came '' and the delightful ' • Flight of the Duchess '' would claim admittance .


Browning	PERSON	's most characteristic form of art is the monologue . ''

		The Ring and the Book '' is a collection of mono - logues .

		This bastard form , wliich is neither drama nor narrative nor lyric , seems to me thoroughly tmnatural .

		A soliloquy in a play is bad enough , but it is sometimes a matter of sheer necessity to a dramatist , and it is always remotely possible that the solQoquist might talk aloud .

		But a soliloquy in plain air , with no compelling cause , seems folly 's farthest flight in literature .

		From Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	one could take ' ^ Lady
Geraldine	PERSON	's Courtship , '' '' The Rhyme of the Duchess
May	DATE	, '' and ''
Bertha	PERSON	in the Lane . ''

		There is unquestionably a touch of over-wrought sentiment in these poems , but they are the utterances of a noble mind , and , what is more to the purpose , they are delightfully readable and rememberable .

		The question of admitting the ballad form of poetry might come up in
Rossetti	LOCATION	's case .

		The ballad , as I take it , is the naive relation of an incident with no conscious effort of art If this is so .

		Rossetti 's poems are not true ballads at all , for they step forth in powder and plumes and war-paint and with all the ftaraphemalia of the artist 's study .

		`` Sister
Helen	PERSON	, '' `` Rose Mary , '' and `` The King 's Tragedy '' would be good representations of his fine though somewhat elaborate poetry .


William Morris	PERSON	is one of the most voluminous writers of narrative verse in the language .

		But the grey monotony of his poetry -- its lack of saliency in phrase , picture , or character -- keep it from preeminence .

		No greater critical mistake was ever made than the equalling of this builder of mistj - dreams in rhyme with the fresh , vivid , poignandy real Chaucer .

		But he deserves a niche in our book , and his ' * Atalanta '' is probably as good a piece as could be chosen .

		We are aU apt to be a little cautions in suggesting our near neighbors for apotheosis .

		The American poetry of the past should furnish its ` quota to this collection , -- but our literature has not extended itself much in the line of epic or narrative verse .

		Perhaps a good part of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's -
Evangeline	PERSON	, ''
Lowell	PERSON	's '' Vision of Sir Lannfal '' -- whose opening verses are the most exquisite movement he ever achieved -- and
Poe	PERSON	's `` Raven '' might be allowed to stand as our best specimens of this kind of poetry .

		The foregoing poems , with perhaps a few others unintentionally omitted , could probably be comprised in two not over-thick pocket volumes .

		These would indeed contain '' infinite riches in a little room . ''

		And their publication ought to be a factor in the coming and inevitable Revival of Poetry .

		Charles
Leonard Moose	PERSON	.

		A REXAKSABLE TRAXSFOHMATIOX OF A BOOK - TITLE was effected by the
San Francisco	LOCATION	fire -- which wrought other transformations also .

		President
Jordan	PERSON	's little book , `` The Hiilosophy of Despair , '' destroyed -LRB- that is , the plates were destroyed i in ibe conflagra - tion , now rises from the fiery furnace , transfigured and glorified , as '' The Philosophy -LRB- rf Hape ^ '' a title which is thought to be '' more cheerfully descriptive of the author 's purpose . ''

		This , of course , is not the first time that real and apparently overwhelming disaster has proved itself the one thing needed to convert a fancied despair into a living hope .

		ProbaUy the publishers had no intention to point a moral by this change of names , but to the person fond of moralizing -- and who is not ?

		-- the moral is there , nevertheless .

		306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		The jubilke numuku of `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' con - tains a veiy interesting account , by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, of how the magazine was launched in the
fall of 1857	DATE	.

		An active existence of half a century is enough to make venerable any institu - tion -LRB- for surely `` The Atlantic '' is an institution -RRB- , and almost any man of parts , in this country .

		In Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's case the activity has covered considerably more than fifty years , while his mere continued existence as an individual has now added him to the honorable roll of octogenarians .

		To be precise , the present issue of The Dial is dated upon Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's eightieth birth - day , which gives us a pretext for paying once more our tribute of respect to the fine intelligence which he has so efl ` ectively brought to bear upon so many problems of art and conduct , and to the ethical idealism which he has ever sought to translate into action in our public and private life .

		Although his professional interests have been those of the scholar , he has never lapsed into the indifferentism that scholarship often assumes as its pre - scriptive right , and his influence has made itself felt for good in many a great public cause .

		The moral strength of his mherited puritanism has blossomed into sweetness in the genial sunlight of modern liberal thought , and his life stands for us as an embodiment of those qualities which we cherish as characteristic of Americans in the best sense .

		A man is in no way better tested than by the friendships he makes , and no American of our time better meets this test .

		Longfellow and
Emerson	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	and
Curtis	PERSON	on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	,
Kuskin	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	and
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	on the other , all bestowed upon him their intimacy , and enriched his life with their affectionate regard .

		And the esteem in which those men held him has been shared by count - less others , unknown to fame , whose ideals he has helped to ennoble , and whose gratitude they would find it diffi - cult to put into words .

		• • • The land of ' juveniij ; delights is undoubtedly
Fairyland	LOCATION	.

		What particular nook or corner , or grove or glen , or hill or vale , has most attracted great men in their tender infancy , has been inquired into by an enter - prising publishing house ; and as a result of the investi - gation we now have -- after a more than sufficient course in `` books that have helped me '' -- something about '' books that have enchanted me . ''

		A volume entitled '' Favorite Fairy Tales : The childhood choice of Repre - sentative Men and Women '' presents sixteen selected stories , the favorites of twenty judges of wide repute m the literary world .

		But there is no unanimity of choice : the highest number of votes cast for the same tale is five ; '' Cinderella '' and ''
Jack	PERSON	the Giant-Killer '' received each that number , while even such nursery favorites as '' Little Red Riding Hood '' and '' Beauty and the Beast '' had only a single champion apiece .

		More authoritative and valuable would be -- if we could have it -- the actual childhood choice , as uttered in childhood instead of in retrospect , of all these illus - trious ladies and gentlemen , or perhaps even the childhood choice of the same number of bright boys and girls not yet illustrious .

		AVould the six-year-old
Henry James	PERSON	, for example , have made the same choice , and in the same words , as the sexagenarian Henry
James	PERSON	?

		This is what he characteristically says about '' Hop-o ' - My-Tliumb , '' which finds in him its single admirer among the twenty judges : '' It is the vague memory of this sense of him , as some small , precious object , like a lost gem or a rare and beautifid insect on which one might inadvertently tread , or might find under the sofa or behind the window cushion , that leads me to think of ' Hop-o ' - My-Thumb ' a-s ray earliest and sweetest and most repeated cupful at the fount of fiction . ''

		• • • Humors and oddities of advertising are too novel , and often too amusing , to pass unnoticed in these days when advertising is cultivated iis a fine art , and each advertiser seems determined to outdo liis rivals in the invention of some extraordinary eye-attracting , attention-compelling , interest-awakening device in words or pictures or in both .

		Lady
Betty Bulkeley	PERSON	, in that popular novel , '' Lady Betty Across the Water , '' found the advertising pages not the least interesting part of American magazines ; while more than one American visitor to
England	LOCATION	has discovered most amusmg reading in the '' want '' columns of British newspapers .

		What a wealth of homely detail in the following : '' The invalid widow of an army officer would like to exchange a talking parrot for a second-clasii railway ticket from
London	LOCATION	to
Glasgow	LOCATION	. ''

		Henry
Kingsley	PERSON	, half a century ago , in one of his many confidential asides to the readers of '' Ravenshoe , '' professed to be able at any time to banish care by reading -- reading anything , even adver - tisements .

		In the '' help-wanted '' columns of a great city daily there has just appeared a gem of the litera - ture of its kind .

		Let us quote : `` I desire to secure the services of a woman -- not the usual type of ' refined lady ' who is constantly on the hunt for a job -- but a masterful , dignified woman of character , common-sense , and gootl breeding , who is qualified by temperament and education to take charge of my twelve-year-old daughter .

		The religioiLs convictions of applicants are of no concern to the advertiser , nor need applicants possess an academic or university degree , but their English must be somid -- gi'ammar perfect .

		I would not care to seriously consider engaging a woman who combined daisies and violets on her winter bonnet , or one who referred to ciockery as ' porcelain , ' or one whose elegant repose of manner is mere vacuity , or one who bids for sympatliy by frequently recurring , in soreness of spirit , to her ' past reverses which are responsible for present anomalous and unfortunate circumstances , ' or one who extorts reluctant gleams of pleasure only f i-om melancholy pangs of grief , or one who beflours her face with the incessant acit de poudre , or one who in manner may be likened > into a hurricane . ''

		Tlius by the method of exclusions do we gam a more and more definite con - ception of the kind of woman desired ; though the acil de poudre must remain a puzzler to mascidmity .

Charles Lamb	LOCATION	.

		Per - plexing difficulties were encountered by those engaged in this search .

		It was commonly held that the house at 19
Colebrook Row	ORGANIZATION	had once been occupied by the Lambs , but a rather prosaic and disenchanting bit of evidence was brought forward to disprove this .

		Certain old sewer-rate books were disinterred and consulted , and thus it was demonstrated that no person by the name of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	had paid sewer rates in
Colebrook	LOCATION	Row within the period in question .

		So at last the right house was found at 64
Duncan Terrace	ORGANIZATION	,
Islington	LOCATION	, where the tablet has with proper formalities been set .

		Then , in
Holden	LOCATION	's Directory of

		That mouthpiece of all that is most • determinedly and defiantlj - British , the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' in speaking of the third volume of Sir

George Trevelyan	PERSON	's literary skill to help it .

		Whatever were the virtues of
Washington	LOCATION	, whatever the courage and endurance of those who fought imder him and some of those who fought against hum , it remains the melancholy truth that the governing factor of the situation , the thing which lost and won
America	LOCATION	, was nobody 's genius and nobody 's heroism , but the criminal ignorance of English statesmen and the slow incompetence of English generals . ''

		Of course the time is long past for declaim - ing against tlie '' pestilent rebellion '' of the American colonists , and no Englishman now thinks of refus - ing to dignify that colonial uprising ^ vith the name `` revolution '' ; but a refreshing if belated candor is evinced in the above extract , in which , if scant credit is given to
Washington	LOCATION	and his compatriots , the grains of comfort for the British side are few and innutritions .

		Some interesting statistics -LRB- perhaps the first of the kind ever compiled and made public -RRB- from the

		The
Pratt Library	ORGANIZATION	is a fair sample of the average public library , serving the wants of an average community .

		The month of

		In that month 8934 persons came to the delivery room to draw or return books , and of these persons 55 per cent were found to be women and girls , and 45 per cent men and boys .

		The librarian adds : '' As we know from observation that there are many more women and girls who come to get books for father , husband , or brother , than there are men and boys who come to get them for mother , wife , or sister , we conclude that there is verj - little difference in the I masculine and feminine use of the library , as far as numbers go .

		It is certain that as a rule the men read less fiction , and it is interesting to note that everj -

		The various reading rooms of the reference department were found to be frequented by men and boys in a great majority over women and girls , or
seventy-three per cent	MONEY	.

		It is pleasing to meet this evidence that man , the bread - winner and the busy member of the family , is neverthe - less a library-goer , even if he has largely ceased to be a chia ^ h-goer L'nlike the husband who took shelter behind his wife , who had '' got religion '' for the two , the paterfamilias of to-day need not point to his better half as monopolizing the culture of the partnership .

		For helping to redeem the human mind from error on this disputed question , we thank the

		From his first entrance as a sleek , well-groomed , beautifully-caparisoned riding-horse , to the pitiful scene where he is beheld vainly tugging at a monstrous load up a terrible hill in a blinding snow - storm .

		308 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, THE AMERICAN MARKET FOR FRENCH BOOKS .


Paris	LOCATION	,
November 4 , 1907	DATE	.

		What is the matter with the market for French books in the
United States	LOCATION	?

		This is the interesting question that has lately been xuider discussion in the columns of several of the important journals of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		That inde - fatigable gentleman ,
M. Hugues Le Roux	PERSON	, has been investigating the case , and he has called in consultation a number of the literary doctors most in repute at the moment , such as Messieurs
Paul Hervieu	PERSON	,
Marcel Provost	PERSON	,
Jules Claretie	PERSON	,
Henri Houssaye	PERSON	, and
Abel Hemiant	PERSON	.

		All are agreed that the reputation of the French book among us is in a very bad way , and that something ought to be done at once .

		We may well be interested in their efforts .

		For if the
United States	LOCATION	should cease altogether to be importers of French books , it would not be the French authors and publishers who would be the only losers .

		We should be immeasurably poorer without the part that
France	LOCATION	can contribute to our intellectual life .

		It would appear , from the diagnosis of
M. Le Roux	PERSON	, that the trouble may be traced to a variety of causes .

		In the first place , in the words of one of the journals referred to , there is a united effort on the part of com - peting nations to stifle the propagation of the French language and French thought in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		These competitors , among whom the Germans occupy naturally a foremost place , liave foimd most efficient allies in the teachers of French in om - schools , colleges , and universities , of whose incompetence M. Le Roux draws a terrifying pictui-e .

		The teachmg of French in the
United States	LOCATION	, it seems , is almost whoUy in the hands of Germans , Swiss , Belgians , and Americans , equally unable , for different reasons , to interpret French thought and initiate our youth into the real secrets of the French language .

		As
M. Le Roux	PERSON	visited not a few of our schools and universities as the official lecturer of the
Alliance Frangaise	ORGANIZATION	, it is to be supposed that this sweep - ing condemnation is based upon personal observation , and I suppose it would be out of place on the part of one of these same incompetent Americans to protest .

		And in support of this opinion ,
M. Maxime Ingres	PERSON	, who , I presume , is not yet forgotten in
Chicago	LOCATION	, has sketched , in the
Matin	LOCATION	, what he avers to be the exact and lifelike portrait of the professor of French in our country , but what appears to one of the incompetents to be a most grotesque caricature .

		To say the least ,
M. Ingres	PERSON	has not been scrupulously exact in his statements of fact .

		But all these enemies , active and passive , wilful and unconscious , of the French book among us would not have brought it to the sorry pass in which it now is were it not for an tmclean sore that it bears within itself .

		For it is ag ^ - eed among our doctors that if the good name of French literature is in a decline , and consequently the demand for French books has fallen off , a principal reason is to be found in the charge of lubricity and indecency to which they are so often open .

		La Utterature pomographique is largely responsible for the situation .

		Authors and publishers , catering to the debauched taste of the sensuiil reader , have so swollen the mass of this ill-smelling literature that it is begmuing to be taken to represent French letters , to their serious hurt .

		The hasty and unwarranted conclusion has been drawn that all French books are alike , and no better than the worst ; and as a result the great American public , whose modesty is so sensitive , almost irritable , will have none -- or very few -- of them .

		If this diagnosis is correct -LRB- and few will think that it is wholly wrong -RRB- , the remedy proposed hardly seems likely to result in a complete cure .

		What is suggested , beyond the more effective organization of publishers to push their interests over-sea , is nothing more than a kind of inspection to which literature for export , at least to the
United States	LOCATION	, is to be subjected .

		No work shall be allowed to pass that can not be branded as sound and wholesome .

		To say nothing of the discrimination which such action contemplates against the home market , it may be doubtful whether it can possibly accomplish its purpose .

		Inspection may have saved the foreign market for American meat .

		But a book is a very different thing from a piece of meat .

		If a book is stamped as unclean , it is not at all sure that it is thereby irrevocably consigned to the soap-vat .

		If there were a lively demand for tainted meat for food , it is pretty sure that some would find its way to the eager purchaser .

		Of course the Utterature pomographiqiie is not published from miselfish motives , nor thrust by missionaries into the hands of unwilling readers .

		In producing books of this kind , authors and pubhshers are reckoning on a public demand .

		If they find them profitable , how are they to be convinced that it would be still more profit - able not to publish them , or not to allow them to reach a certain region of territory or a certain circle of readers ?

		And how could they prevent them from reaching that circle of readers if they were so convinced ?

		And then comes the question .

		What are the boun - daries of this literature , and how is it to be defined ?

		Are the tales of Maupassant to be included within it ?

		Is Zola a pornographic author ?

		Are all the doctors whom M. Le Roux lias called in consultation , --
M. Marcel Provost	PERSON	, for example , -- in position to cast the first stone at some unexportable brother ?

		I strongly suspect that , while their diagnosis contains much truth , it does not contain all the truth , and that the American distrust of the French book is based partly upon a deep difference , national aud racial , of habit and feeling with regard to certain matters -- that difference that made so intelligent and liberal a critic as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, with all his recognition of tlie eminent and superior qualities of the French mind and its achievements , lodge against that people the charge of worshipping at the shrine of the
Goddess Lubricity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tlie agitation of the question , a propos of the commercial interest which the American market offers , is worth noting rather as a symptom of awakening consciousness in this direction tha : i as promising any great direct or immediate result .

		We may regret that it seems rather a sordid motive that prompted this consciousness to express itself ; but as a symptom it is none the less most welcome , and infinitely more important than any practical measures that it may provoke .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have just read , with much satisfaction , the interesting and appreciative review of ray brother 's autobiography , in your issue for
October 16	DATE	.

		The notice , all in all , is so satisfactory to
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	's many friends that I the more readily ask your attention to one or two very natural errors , which you may deem it worth while to correct in another issue of The Dial .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 In the first paragraph ,
Lincoln Memorial University	ORGANIZATION	, of
Cumberland Gap	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, is classed as one of the schools for '' colored youth . ''

		It has nerer had a colcwed stodent , and was not designed for such , but for the
American Mountaineers	ORGANIZATION	-- from which racial stock
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	is supposed to have had his origin .

		President Lincoln himself personally directed General
Howard	PERSON	's attention to the loyalty of these mountaineers , andtfaoogfa in the Reconstruction period
Geueral Howard	ORGANIZATION	fonnded a number of schools for colored youth , like
Howard L'niversity	PERSON	in
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C , this
University	ORGANIZATION	at
Cumberland Gap	ORGANIZATION	was designed exclusively for whites , and for the past fifteen years or more
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	has devoted almost his entire time and energies to the laying of its foundations and building it up , not only by ample endowment , but also in the confidence and affec - tion of the mountain people .

		One other point , which might seem to yon as merely technical , is the reference to
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	's military career as reaching < mly to the command of an
Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a matter of fact , he became the Commander of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	, the same army with which
Grant	ORGANIZATION	captured
Vicksburg	LOCATION	, and which
Sherman	ORGANIZATION	commanded in one or two campaigns and at the battle of
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		It consisted of three fidl
Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	and other detached bodies , amoimting to over a hundred thousand men .

		The tliree Corps were the 15th -LRB-
Logan	LOCATION	's -RRB- , 16tli -LRB-
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , and the 17th -LRB- Blair s -RRB- .

		As
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	is the only remaining Army Commander of the Civil War , it seems worth while to keep this fact in view in considering the value and merit of these two volumes of autobiography .

		THE rescit : of a poem in distress .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
Thk Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Do you ever listen to an author 's tale of woe -- even a poet 's ?

		May I tell you the sad story of the sacrifice of a poem -- two poems , indeed -- not to the eccen - tricity of printer or proof-reader -LRB- that would be too common ^ , bot to an editor 's curious mismating of titles , a mockingly perverse juxtaposition ?

		Poems are sensitive products ; as a wind makes sport of a rose , so -- bat I will proceed .

		Four or five years ago one of the minor magazines offered a number of prizes , one being a prize of two hundred dollars , for the best poem less than thirty-six lines in leng ^ .

		Inspired by a gambler 's hope of wealth , I sent the editor four or five pieces , concealing my name in a sealed envelope , according to the rules of the game .

		In two or three mouths came an envelope from the editor 's sanctum .

		Conld I be the lucky winner ?

		But my hope of riches subsided when I read the contents : the editor asked me to divide the prize with no less than nine other poets !

		I will not comment upon the point of editorial honor involved in this method of securing large returns of poetry for a very small outlay of dollars .

		My grievance vented itself in laughter ; I let the editor have the poem , and also three others for which he nobly offered sixpence apiece .

		In a few months the first was published , and a second soon after .

		Of the two which lingered in the editor 's desk , one , which I called '' The Question , '' had been written in the lightest spirit of badinage for a '' 1 Jttle Room '' valen - tine party .

		It began : What U love ' .

		Lore u a fire .

		But tears ca n't quench it , -- ' and continued with nnmeroos fnTidons answers to the I query in the first line .

		The other piece had been written somewhat earlier , ' and in a very different mood .

		Its subject was rather ambitious : human personality , the ego , especially the feminine ego , the summing-up of all life in the individual soul .

		Titles are very boresome , and I had never found a good one for tlus poem . ''

		The Answer , '' '' The Question , '' `` Myself '' were some rather inadequate experiments , and I scarcely knew under which of them it had gone to the magazine .

		Judge , then , of my horror when , in a recent issue of the same magazine , I found the two poems printed together !

		The valentine poem became '' The Question , '' the other `` The Answer , '' and both , by the unhappy association , were stabbed , killed , reduced to ashes .

		My heart went out to the hapless reader who should obediently take the two pieces together and try to make the second answer the light question of the first .

		Whether he would read them both as serious , or both as a joke , my jumbled In ^ in scarcely dared inqiure .

		Twice in vain I had written the editor for proofs , and thus he and fate flouted me .

		Not only that , but here , in the serious poem , was a pivotal word deliberately changed to a weak one without so much as a '' by-your-leave . ''

		Had I no right to feel aggrieved ?

		And now , being an editor yourself and therefore solicitous for the honor of your clan , will you rescue a poem in distress ?

		Will vou nntangle my verses on human personahty -- on the ego , myself -LRB- you may find a title if you can -RRB- -- from the evil meshes in which they were smothered , and let them I stand free at last upon your page ?

		Here are the verses : What am I ?

		I am Earth the mother .

		West Point Half a
Centtjky Ago	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The pages of General
Schaff	PERSON	's '' Spirit of Old West Point '' breathe at once the poetiy and ro - mance of warfare , as the poet and the romancer are fond of conceiving it , and also the grim hor - ror and sad pity of it all , as seen and felt by the soldier on the battlefield .

		This curious mingling of seeming incompatibles , symbolic of the self - contradictory element in life itself , shows the author to be a poet as well as a warrior , a man of imagination as well as a man of action .

		His love of poetic imagery , his tendency to infuse with life and feeling the inanimate objects about him , his fondness for drawing spiritual truths from material facts , give to his narrative a higher beauty and a deeper meaning than we are wont to find in a soldier 's reminiscences .

		Graduated from
West Point	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	, the au - thor was sent at once to the field , where he served under
Meade	PERSON	,
Hooker	PERSON	, and Grant .

		Thus it is that his memories of the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and of his instructors and fellow-students , are con - tinually calling up other memories of campaigns and battlefields where some of those teachers and classmates played more or less important parts .

		This repeated jumping from the bank of the Hudson to that of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, from the cadet chapel to the Wilderness , from the recitation room to the field of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, makes rather jolty reading , but gives variety and life to his chapters , and affords frequent opportunity for pen-jjainting and for outbursts of patriotic elo - quence .

		A reverent and at times a devout tone sounds through the book and shows this soldier to have been equipped for spiritual no less than for carnal conflict .

		He was , while at the Acad - emy , a member of `` Howard 's little prayer - meeting , '' which never numbered more than ten or fifteen souls , and which
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	has himself described in his own memories of West Point .

		The almost simultaneous appearance of the older and the younger West Pointers ' books adds interest to the following passage from the junior 's pen : '' My other instructor m pure mathematics was Major -
Greneral O. O Howard	PERSON	, probably known more widely among the church-going people of our country than any officer of his time .

		His head is now almost snowy white , and his armless sleeve tells its story ; yet when I saw him last there was the same mild , deeply sincere , country - bred simplicity in his face that it wore when , so many years ago , I sat on the bench or stood before him in the • The Spirit op Old West Point .

		His voice too had barely changed at all ; it was still pitched in the same mellow , clerical !

		• ey , and accompanied , when humorous in its vein , with the same boyish smile in his earnest blue eyes , -- eyes always filled with that light of another and a hoher land , the fair land of the Clu-istian 's gaze . ''

		As there are few now living who have seen and can distinctly remember General
Winfield Scott	PERSON	, it may be worth while to take a look at him tlirough the younger soldier 's eyes .

		The old warrior was , at the time now recalled , in command of the army , with his headquarters at West Point . ''

		The old General made himself heard , considered , and felt throughout the comitry .

		He was over six feet six inches tall , and in frame was simply colossal .

		It so happened that only the rail separated his pew in the chapel from the one which I occupied , -- it was four or five pews back , on the right side facing the chancel , -- and I felt like a pigmy when I stood beside him .

		The old fellow was devout ; but it was said that whatsoever church he attended .

		Episcopal ,
Baptist	LOCATION	, Methodist , or Roman Catholic he threw himself into the service with the same depth of reverence .

		Nevertheless he would sometimes swear like a pirate .

		Surely , I think nature must have been in one of her royal moods at his birth , for there was magnificence in the dignity of his great , kingly , illuminated countenance ... We were all proud of the old hero , and more than ever when , in the blaze of full uniform and with uncovered head , he stood at the left of the present King of
England	LOCATION	at the review given for him at West Point in
1860	DATE	. ''

		General
Schaff	PERSON	's estimate of West Point as a character-builder and a maker of men finds repeated expression in his book .

		To him his alma mater is indeed a gracious mother of noble sons , and his ideal of a liberal education is a four-years coui-se under her fostering care .

		He dwells fondly on the
Acatlemy	ORGANIZATION	's honored past , on its historic antecedents which have made it what it now is .

		At the same time the man of letters speaks in him when he ventures to criti - cize what he thinks an excessive devotion to science in the curriculum , and urges the counter - claims of history and literature .

		However , he continues in panegyric strain : '' But weigh the course as you may , -- and certainly her graduates have worthily met the mighty problems of war , -- this must be said : West Point is a great char - acter-builder , perhaps the greatest among our institu - tions of learning .

		The habit of truth-telling , the virtue of absolute honesty , the ready and loyal obedience to authority , the display of courage , -- that virtue called regal , -- to establish these elements of character , she labors without ceasing .

		Tlie primary agency in accom - plishing her ends is , and has been , the tone of the cadets .

		This tone , the very life and breath of the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	, tracks back to a fine source , to the character of
Washington	LOCATION	and the best society at the time of the Revolution , for , since the day when he had his head - quarters at
West Point	LOCATION	, it has been exclusively a mili - tary post , completely isolated from the social ferment and adventitious standards of commerce and trade .

		But I can not resist the conclusion that , if militarism grows more ascendant , serious changes must take place iu the ideals of West Point ; for ideals feed on culture , they lie down in the green pastures of knowledge , their shrines are not in dnuns but iu the aspirations of the heart .

		Militarism once fully entrenched tolerates no challenge of preced - ence and cidture ; scholarship , idealism , those great liberating forces , must grow less and less influential as less and less they are appreciated and reverenced .

		Nothing , it seems to me , could be worse for West Point or worse for the army as a profession than to have the
Academic Board	ORGANIZATION	sink to the level of mere teachers ; in other words , to see West Point fall from the level of a nniversity to that of a jiost school at a garrison ... '' Among the post-gi-aduate reminiscences so generously interspersetl , nothing is better than this picture of General Grant : '' Let me say in this connection that of all the officers of high rank whom I have ever met , onlj - Grant and
Sherman	PERSON	did not charge the atmosphere about them with military consequence .

		While at City Point I frequently joined my friends of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's staff ... at his headquarters .

		The Geuei-al , in undress unifonn , always neat but not fastidious in appointments , would sit at the door of his tent , or sometimes on one of the long settees that faced each other imder the tent-fly , smoke , listen , and sometimes talk ; and not a soul of us , from the youngest to the oldest , ever had a thought of rank .

		Without lowering liis manner to the level of familiarity , he put every one at his ease by his natural simplicity .

		He had none of the caprices of moods or vanity .

		Quiet in his presence and natural in his manner , gentle in voice , of absolute purity in speech , of imatf ected , simple dignity .

		Grant threw a charm around his camp-fire .

		West Point never graduated a man who added so little austerity or pretense to the peak of fame . ''

		The foretaste that ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' readers have hatl of these very readable chapters ought to give additional relish to the completed book , which contains much additional matter , as well as nmnerous and excellent views of West Point buildings and scenes , past and present .

		One looks in vain for the author 's portrait among the plates ; but regret at not finding it would prob - ably have given place to a greater regret had General

		All About Everythln-g ix Homer .

		* From various volumes on Homeric subjects the rather rebellious re ^ aewer happened to turn to Mr.
A. D. Godley	PERSON	's unique '' Verses to Order , '' and a kindly
Athena	ORGANIZATION	guided his eye to this delight : ' • POLUPHLOISBOISTEROUS Homer of old Threw all his augments into the sea , Althoug ^ h he bad often been courteously told That perfect imperfects begin with an e : But the Poet replied , with a dignified air , ' What the Digarama does anyone care ? ' ''

		And in all seriousness what does anyone care about nine-t `` ntLs or more of the flood of Homeric controversy and commentary ?

		For instance , may we beg the courteous reader to turn his twin-eyed gaze ujwn the following tabulation from a German scholar , and the generalizing comment ?

		Homeric Modem Warfare .

		Womids on the Head , 21 per

		Perhaps the joyous German insistence on these details was innately military ; perhaps it was CA'en proudly national , intended to offset the enthusi - astic Frenchman who suggested that the author * Life is the Homebic Age .

		312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, of the Iliad was aide-de-camp or military sec - retary to Agamemnon .

		Be that as it may , let us try to imagine the thrill of enlarged horizons conveyed by the above to a reader who has been following Achilles in his death-dealing rage , or standing by
Menelaus	PERSON	when the tiiice-ending arrow of
Pandarus	LOCATION	had brought him nigh to death , and blood was staining his shapely thighs , '' even as when a woman , Mieonian or Carian , stains ivory with pui-ple , to be a cheek-piece for horses . ''

		And , lest Philology should be preeminent in pedantic motley , her sister Archajology occasionally assumes the jingling bells and sings that '' one square half-inch of ancient potsherd is worth a hundred written tomes . ''

		Fortunate was the boy who `` began his Homer with few notes and no problems .

		His was the joy , in some measure , of the old Greek audience that hung on the winged words as they came from the lips of Ion or some other rhap - sodist ; for even yet the divine magnetism of which
Plato	ORGANIZATION	tells may stream tlirough the series of rmgs from poet to reader , and work compel - lingly upon the mind of man .

		Howbeit , the two sisters in their ordinary mood of loving and laborious ministry have achieved notable results and have deserved thorougldy well of the one demi-god or the thousand men who moulded the Homeric poems .

		They have brought us to a delectable inn , where , as we enjoy our poet , we may order almost any favorite theory and have it served by at least one eminent scholar while our stupid opponent is being equally well served at the neighbormg table .

		If the descendants of WoK still seek to tear the poems asunder , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	sturdily defends their essen - tial unity ; if a few still cling to the '' ballad '' theory ,
M. Breal	PERSON	pins his faith to a real epopee emanating from a formal or even courtly civil - ization .

		Moreover , while the sisters leave us this pleasant luxm-y of wavering about numerous questions , they have in many cases enabled us to exchange an old problem for a new one , and not a few of the difficidties they have actually settled .

		Some time in the course of the second mil - lennium
B.C.	LOCATION	, -- say from the seventeenth to fourteenth centuries , -- an opident civilization of a decidedly oriental tinge spread over the sprinkled isles of the ^ gean and some of the neighboring shores .

		At various centres were dynasts of great wealth , having at their com - mand skilful artificers in many crafts , par - ticidarly cunning workers in metal , whose products still delight our eyes and command Our admiration .

		Then came a change , not as cataclysmic as we were asked to believe , but still a material change ; and the golden glories gave way to an age that was yet wealthy and comfoi-table , although its life was simpler and its crafts more humble .

		During this period the Homei'ic poems were either evolved or created , the work of countless minor bards , or of several great poets , or primarily of one supreme master .

		Personally the present writer has always been inclined to believe roughly in the essential unity of final authorship .

		This does not preclude either the free utilization of rich material by the fashioning author , or minor accretions from later hands .

		At any rate , the Iliatl and Odyssey came into being in the course of this second era .

		From an exact date one still shrinks , although
M. Breal	PERSON	is willing to assign '' the works passing under the name of Homer '' to the era of the last Lydian kings .

		Between eleven hundred and eight hundred B. c. would seem as close an approximation as would be safe at present .

		The poems certamly con - tain traces of the earlier '' golden '' civilization , and we need not be regarded as very teri'ible stratifiers if we can not limit the picture to quite as short and definite a period as does Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		We have spoken of the poems as things writ - ten ; and it is pleasant to reflect that one more bogy of our childhood days has been laid to rest : '' necessary oral transmission '' has disappeared before evidences of writing long antecedent to the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey .

		Fur - thermore , they were written in a conventional dialect that does not belong to any one of the recognized ethnical or linguistic divisions of the early Greeks , such as ^ olic or Ionic .

		To this an interesting parallel has been found in the Ti-oubatlour use of
Limousin	LOCATION	, wherein are mingled many Provencal , Italian , and other forms .

		Such a settled dialect and the elabo - rate hexametrical verse point to a long line of sinjrers as well as to an audience with a trained taste .

		Indeed , there is much to support the contention that the poetry is primarily court poetry , if we use the term with due reserve as to the connotation .

		For of times the court must have been very simple ; and the connec - tion between princes and retainers was so close that for the most part they doubtless heard the songs together .

		And the singers sang of count - less things , alike of those that had been , and those that were , and those that coidd never be .

		To help us understand the song , many men have written many books , the latest being from the hand of the honored
Ilillhouse Professor of Greek m Yale University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		THE DIAL .

		31S point of view has been philological , not archseo - logical .

		From the poet 's language he has attempted to discover what was before the poet 's mind . ''

		Arch `` ological studies are warmly recommended in conjunction with the author s work ; but his own book `` seeks to set forth with regard to Homeric antiquities simply what may be learned from the Homeric poems them - selves , with such illustration as is obvious or naturally presented from other sources . ''

		The outcome is a vohmie of the Eealien type so common in
Grermany	LOCATION	.

		Thus , one chapter treats of '' Trade antl the Crafts , '' another of '' Animals , Fishes , Birds , and Insects . ''

		another of `` Homeric War , '' and so on .

		Then imder each subdivision , -- e. g. , '' Fortification of the Homeric Age '' or ' •
Beha %	PERCENT	- iour with different Wotmds , '' -- all the pertinent passages are care - fuUv collected and briefly commented upon .

		Not infrequently there is an archalogical refer - ence or a helpful parallel from the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment .

		In accordance with the general plan , everything in the poems , from olives to
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, is pigeon-holed and made immediately available .

		One of the most attractive chapters Ijears the caption • • The Troad . ''

		Every man has visual - ized a Troad of his own ; and some are in a position to share the enthusiasm of Professor
Seymour	PERSON	's traveller . ''

		I took advantage of a little leisure to read the Iliad over again in the presence of the great natural features of the scene .

		Xo one who has not seen the magnificent outline which bounds the horizon of the plain of Troy can bring home to his mind the stirring and marvellous narrative of the poet as Homer meant it to affect his readers , or rather hearers . ''

		We too remember some days of dream in the Dardanelles or on the Troad .

		Agamemnon
Schliemann	PERSON	was our cabin-mate , and the expe - dition was under the leadership of Professor
William Dorpfeld	PERSON	, as brilliant as he is thorough .

		But after all , as we look back , we are not sure that the elusive genius loci was not caught as well in the ill-equipped schoolroom of our boy - hood days as it was in the material Troad , vis - ited even under such glorious conditions .

		And we are gratefid to the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	classicist for pointing out that Homer was not a topographer .

		As a matter of fact the writer of the Iliad needed no more knowledge of the plain of Troy than could be attainetl by a man who had learned his geography from others -- pirates , travellers , or what not .

		We know now that
Hissarlik	ORGANIZATION	is the site of Troy : that the coast-line is not materially changed ; that the Mendere is the Scamander , and that the
Dumbrek	PERSON	is the
Simois	PERSON	.

		It will also be recalled that on the site of the city Pro- fessor Dorpfeld found nine strata , representing nine successive settlements , and that he places Troy in the sixth layer from the bottom .

		As one listens to the eminent German 's own arguments , glowingly delivered amid the pathetic ruins , one is almost enthusiastically sure of his eorreetness even in details ; but cold reason would indicate that some modifications of his views are quite possible if there shall be any serious excavation by other hands , -- an unlikely contingency for the present generation .

		Touching some minor points on the plain , the views may well be as shifting as the betl of the Scamander itself , with - out marring either our enjoj-ment or our essential imderstanding .

		Professor
Seymour	PERSON	's chapter offers an accessible and reliable summary of the most recent conclusions , and his readers should feel comparatively at home in the passages in - volving a conception of these storied scenes .

		The chapter on the Troad is separated from its important kinsman dealing with ''
Cosmo	ORGANIZATION	- graphy and Geography . ''

		Here the main fea - ture of current interest is the controversy as to whether the
Ithaca	LOCATION	of the poems is the modem
Ithaca	LOCATION	, or Lenkas .

		Our author pronounces no decision , but seems inclined to favor Professor
Dorpfeld	PERSON	's choic-e of the latter island .

		In a later chapter , however -LRB- p. 94 -RRB- , he speaks of the island of
Ithaca	LOCATION	as though it had been definitely identified .

		In recent Homeric geographical dis - cussion the most startling thing is ''
M. Beraxd	PERSON	's sumptuous book intended to prove that the Odyssey was only a Greek paraphrase of the ` Sailing Directions of Phoenician mariners . ' ''

		This work is promptly and deliberately shelved by Professor Se _ \ Tnour , and few will question the soimdness of his tenet that '' we need not be more definite than Homer . ''

		But we may be allowed to mention , in passing , that parts of I
M. Berard	PERSON	's adventurous essay are uncommonly readable .

		It is so pleasant to bave every possible or impossible Homeric place identified beyond : controversy ; and this the zealous Frenchman does for us with truly national charm .

		ilany other captions invite comment , partio - idarly '' The Homeric State '' ; but we must limit ourselves to a brief note on `` Women and the Family . ''

		This chapter b ^ ins with a depiction of eight women selected as Homeric types .

		Here too our author follows the same I conscientious method of quotation and comment ' that he does elsewhere .

		Although this involves rather uncomfortable limitations , inasmuch as it is a little hard to conceive of
Helen	PERSON	and Andromache as
Realien	LOCATION	, it certainly precludes 814 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, efPusIveness .

		And if Professor
Seymour	PERSON	does no undue glorifying , neither does he sin with
Lemaitre	PERSON	in his Contes , and a few serious critics , by spoiling the white picture of the girl
Nausicaa	LOCATION	, and troubling with little Parisian peb - bles of doubt the still sweet depths of
Penelope	LOCATION	's faithfiU heart .

		To the topics taken up later in the chapter , the liealien method is better adapted ; and we have a clear treatment of such questions as the heading of the chapter would readily suggest .

		Of the foregoing , as of all other sections of '' Life in the Homeric Age , '' it may be said that they represent painstaking erudition .

		Professor
Seymour	PERSON	has spent a large part of a studious life in preparing himself for the wi-iting of such a book ; and it is probably a rash reviewer who would assail him , save in the numerous details that are always debatable in such a connection .

		And yet , in all respectfid honesty we must point out some not unimportant grounds for unfavor - able criticism .

		The most serious disappointment is due in part to the fact that the title , '' Life in the Homeric age , '' suggests a volume teeming with movement and inspiration ; whereas the very method of treatment precludes the realiza - tion of any such conception .

		In the second place , the work seems too detailed for a yoimger student , while for an advanced worker it ought to embody more residts from Archaeology and the increasingly important science of Anthro - pology .

		Again , one is compelled to notice a regrettable lack of proportion , a habit of repeti - tion that might be called otiose if one did not know the over-conscientious author , and a con - stant reciu-rence of a negative method of eluci - dation .

		Of this last tendency one could quote scores of instances .

		Thus : '' The Achaeans had no written documents ; and no mortgages to foreclose . '' ''

		Nothing indicates the existence of detailed rules for the bringing up of chil - dren . ''

		The next two sentences show in addi - tion a modernity that the re ^ aewer feels to be thoroughly infelicitous : '' The success or failure of the fight does not rest Nvith him -LSB- the private soldier -RSB- : he is not ' the man behind the gun . ' '' ''

		This is ' team work ' rather than ' individual play ' ; but it is not a Macedonian phalanx . ''

		The explanation of the painfid frequency of these examples is doubtless to be sought in the prior employment of much of the material in the class-room , where every device to arouse and maintain interest may be not only legitimate but laudable .

		In an ambitious and dignified work , however , they are surely out of place .

		Minor questions of style we pass in silence save one .

		The laundrying expedition of
Nausicaa	ORGANIZATION	is mentioned ten or twelve times , and she almost invariably '' laves the linen . ''

		when one would so much prefer to have her wash it .

		But there is a larger question involved ; for if we are dealing with a very late epopee and a very artificial court life , we should liave to regard
Nausicaa	ORGANIZATION	's fateful expedition as the caprice of an archaiz - ing princess who would certainly '' lave the linen . ''

		Flowever , it is probable that even
M. Breal	PERSON	woidd not carry the point to such a logi - cal conclusion , and Professor
Seymour	PERSON	is doubt - less repeating a phrase , not advocating a theory .

		And it may well be that we should have left this for the classical journals , to which we must suiTcnder so many opportunities to air our presumptuous differences of opinion on technical points .

		Despite all our efforts , the patient reatler will have noticed our skepticism as to the final value of many books of the Realien type ; but if we are to have them , they should adhere stiictly to their plan and not exhibit an imnatural admix - ture of aesthetic criticism .

		If one is occasion - ally tempted to believe that there is nothing less real than liealien , one is often sleepily forced to conclude that there may be nothing more anaesthetic than aesthetics .

		In this respect Professor
Seymour	PERSON	is above reproach .

		The seven hundred pages are well and cor - rectly printed , and the binding is exceptionally appropriate and attractive .

		The illustrations on the whole ai-e helpfid and well-chosen , although one queries the appositeness of the Apollo Belvedere -LRB- facing p. 176 -RRB- .

		There is an English index as weU as a Greek one .

		To the service - able Bibliography even the general reader should now add Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Homer and his Age '' and
M. Breal	PERSON	's '' Pour mieux connaitre Homere , '' which are mentioned in the preface as appearing after most of '' Life in the Homeric Age '' was in type .

		Both of these books are stim - ulating and enjoyable .

		On the purely archaeo - logical side , we should probably recall '' The Discoveries in
Crete	LOCATION	'' by Professor
Ronald Burrows	PERSON	, who discusses the points of contact between the recent excavations and the problems of the Homeric poems .

		THE DIAL 315 The Exglish Xovel axd the Rascally Axti-Hebo .

		* Eight years ago the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	published a book by Professor
Frank Wadleigh Chandler	PERSON	entitled '' The Picaresque Novel in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		further described on the title-page as Part I. of • • Eomances of Roguery . ''

		It was one of the
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	• • Studies in Liter - ature , '' the result of a detailed research into the character and development of the Spanish picaro .

		With hxunor and appreciation un - usual in combination with so much erudition , it showed forth the picaresque rascal , deliciously light-handed , hard-hearted , and glib-tongued , but quite lacking in subtlety of motive -- so mer - cenary indeed as fully to warrant Professor
Chandler	PERSON	's epithet for him of ' • anti-heroic . ''

		It was by virtue of the light that this primitive anti-hero throws upon the hero -- and the anti- hero as well -- of later and more sophisticated romance , -- by virtue , that is , of the position of picaresque literature as an episode in the history of the novel , -- that Professor
Chandler	PERSON	claimed a larger interest for his work than its specialized character might otherwise have warranted .

		But he developed tJiis interesting thesis largely by implication , promising to make it erplicit in a later work , which should rest on the strong foundation afforded by a scholarly investigation of Spanish origins .

		And now Professor
Chandler	PERSON	has fulfilled his promise .

		We do not mean to imply that he necessarily regards • • The Literature of Ro - guery . '

		just published in two volumes by
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	, ilifflin

		of his earlier work ; but we are satisfied to accept it as such , hoping , how - ever , that he will continue to make further con - tributions to a subject which , in its endless and delightful ramifications , he has made peculiarly his own .

		Indeed , we feel that he r ^ lly owes ns at least one more volume as a forfeit for his choice of too general a title for this one .

		Some of the most delightful rascals in literature are quite outside the main trend of the novel 's de - velopment , and if the ballad ra-scaLs , Bums 's and Father
Prout	PERSON	's heroes , and the rogues so deftly sketched in by essayists like Lamb ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	, receive only casual con - sideration or entire omission in a volume en - titled ' • The Literature of Roguery . ''

		iallv when he is as oompetait to do so as Pro- fessor
Chandler	LOCATION	.

		As has been already suggested .

		Professor !

		Chandler 's new book is a study of the develop - \ ment oi one branch of modem fiction .

		The preface states the purpose of the work so accu - rately and so interestingly tihat it deserves to be quoted in fidl , but an excerpt must suffice . ''

		In the broadest sense , this history follows the for - tnnes of the anti-hero in literature .

		More narrowly , it is a study of realism , for it investigates the role enacted in literary art by the observation of low-life .

		Speeifl - callv , it traces in English letters a notable series of gradations from the first crude records of actuality to the complete re-sha -LCB- Mng of experience by the imagination , and in this process it points a constant tendency toward romanbcism , counteracted at times by fresh returns to fact .

		It aims therefore to do a three-fold service : first , to exhibit in its origins and organic growth a body of literature of considerable extent and intrinac interest ; secondly , to trace the development of anti-heroism in letters as reflecting the disintegrating play of the forces of evil in society ; and thirdly , to exemplify a signifiout process and tendency in art . ''

		In accordance with this plan , the opening chapter defines the rogue as differentiated from other delinquent types , and the literature of pre - ponderant roguery as differentiated from that in which the anti-hero is only a minor character or a mere foil for the virtuous hero .

		It then takes a rapid survey of the early stages of the rascal romance in
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		Next follows an account of roguery in English literature as it was developed through the Georgian era , at which point the first volume closes .

		With the consideration of the eighteenth century novelists , the study necessarily becomes more limited , more detailed , and for the general reader probably more interesting .

		With the possible exception , however , of a part of the first chapter , there is nothing esoteric or aca - I demic about Professor
Chandler	PERSON	's work .

		Indeed , i its greatest charm lies in its peculiar oombin - i ation of authority - with htiman interest , of I scholarly methods and an imposing bibliography j with a fine sense of proportion , -- a lai ^ grasp !

		of the matter as a whole and in its relation to other lines of literary research .

		The style has the same two ^ ged appeal ; it is keen , clear-cut , subtle , keeping the fine line between the easy dogmatism of ignorance and the over-qualified hesitancy of the absorbed student , oppressed by masses of detail .

		It is of course impossible to make adequate comment upon any part of Professor
Chandler	PERSON	's study in a brief review .

		Investigators in related fields will like to know that there are complete bibliographies for every section of every chapter ; 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, and they will be particularly interested in orig - inal studies of types like the anatomy of roguery and the criminal biography , which are here for the first time defined and brought into connec - tion with imaginative literature .

		On the other hand , the general reader -- to employ a much abused term -- wiU enjoy such topics as roguery in recent fiction , cockney rogueries , and Borrow 's and
Thackeray	PERSON	's rascals -LRB- the two authors are classed together under the suggestive heatling , '' Sympathetic and Satiric Rogtie Realism '' -RRB- .

		The reader will appreciate , too , the catholic taste and the open-mindedness which show the same interest in modern detective tales and seventeenth-century jest-books , and which link
Greene	PERSON	's conny-catching pamphlets with
Flynt	PERSON	's '' Tramping with Tramps , '' and the Georgian dramas with
Pinero	PERSON	's '' Profligate '' and
McLellan	PERSON	's ''
Leah lOeshna	PERSON	. ''

		Professor
Chandler	PERSON	imderstands the arts of apt quotation and trenchant summary .

		As in his first book , he develops his second and third theses largely by suggestion , stating facts at length and conclusions briefly , and depending upon the sympathy and good judgment of his readers to amplify whatever part of his thesis interests them most .

		One issue not explicitly stated in the preface is the development of the aesthetic concept of roguery from the naive gaiety of the ^ icaro or the crude outline sketches offered in early treatments of the
Robin Hood	ORGANIZATION	and
Robin Goodfellow	PERSON	legends , to the sophisti - cation of a
Becky Sharp	ORGANIZATION	, a
Pringle	LOCATION	, or a
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	, and finally to the evasion of the whole moral issue as personified in Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's Quack , in Kipling 's '' Soldiers Three , '' in
Raffles	LOCATION	, gentleman thief , and in
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, detector of crime , but possessed of all the sang froid , dash , and daring that in earlier literature are the special prerogatives of the rogue him - self .

		All this is of course implied in a study of rogue literature , but Mr.
Chandler	PERSON	's method brings it into special prominence ; and many readers will find it the most interesting feature of his work .

		To illustrate the unusual distinction of Mr.
Chandler	PERSON	's style , we make a few quotations , chosen almost at random .

		Of Jonathan Wild he writes : ''
England	LOCATION	sank to the nadir of social misrule in
the first third of the eighteenth century	DATE	, and its prince of darkness was Jonathan Wild .

		He represents the acme of professionalism in crime .

		As a terror inspirer he has long been invoked by novelists and dramatists , and every criminal chronicle holds him its darling . ''

		Again , in placing
Defoe	PERSON	in the picaresque stream , he says : ''
Defoe	PERSON	had no perception of fine shades of character or of character-development ; the feelings he presents are the simplest ; and emotion with him is the exception rather than the rule .

		Maternal afl : ection , for example , although
Moll Flanders	PERSON	is the mother of twelve children , finds no expression in action , and but little in words . ''

		In speaking of some of
Dickens	PERSON	's rogues he writes : ''
Dotheboys Hall of Wackford Squeers	ORGANIZATION	is as much a place of torment as the school of Doctor Cabra attended by
Don Pablos	PERSON	.

		But
Dickens	PERSON	's earnestness of purpose and special plea for educational i-eform , if they favor over-emphasis , are in contrast with the rollicking trav - esty of the Spaniard .

		Squeers is a rascal , deserving of his sentence to transportation ... The plotting felon ,
Brooker	PERSON	, and the swindler , Sir Mulberry Hawk , verge on the villainous ; but the itinerant
Crummies	PERSON	family and sly
Mantalini	PERSON	, gone to the demnition bow-wows , are pleasantly picaresque . ''

		Finally , we wiU let Mr.
Chandler	PERSON	's concluding paragraph state what he feels that his book has accomplished . ''

		As a force moulding literary history the English literature of roguery has proved most potent in affect - ing the drift of the drama in the early seventeenth centui-y , in cooperating to create the novel in the eight - eenth century , and in amplifying the scope of that novel , and in producing the detective story in the nineteenth centmy .

		If it has stood at a far remove from art in such departments as the anatomies of roguery and the criminal biographies , and in such a work as `` The English Rogue , '' it has also achieved artistic distinction in the later fiction , and it has reckoned among its devotees many whose names rank high in the annals of literature .

		Most picturesque in the days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, most immoral in the days of the Stuarts , and most earnest and at the same time most merry under the
Georges	PERSON	, it has become since the advent of the nineteenth century most diffused , complex , and varied .

		Now it views sordid actuality in the dry light of reason ; now it yields to the play of imagination and of sentiment ; now it is merely ingenious .

		It receives the tribute alike of the roman - ticist and of the realist .

		It adapts itself equally well to the purposes of the moralist and to those of the jester , to the propaganda of the humanitarian reformer , or to the inventions of the light-hearted teller of tales .

		To entertain has ever been its purpose , but although much of it has done only this , in the main the genre has acquired significance in so fai '' as it has also subserved the ends of satire , or revealed the mannei 's and life of the underworld , or contributed to an understanding of character , or furthered a study of social conditions with a view to social improvement .

		In some or all of these directions the literature of roguery has successfully adventured in the past , and these remain the pathways open to its progress in the future . ''

		* The figurative application of a Scriptural text is a favorite device of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's , and it again appears in '' The Fruit of the Tree , '' her latest work of fiction .

		A note of seriousness , and of deep under - lying purpose , is thus struck by the very title-page ; and it need hardly be said at
this late day that	TIME	, besides its accomplished artistry , Mrs. `` Wharton 's ■ work alwaj 's gives us the sense of ethical responsi - bility .

		Her latest theme is perhaps the most daring that she has dealt with , and certainly the one which most demands a responsible attitude , for the par - ticular case of conscience here brought under her analysis is that of the right to shorten human life when its prolongation means only suffering with no attendant hope of recovery .

		Such action as this is justified -LRB- in theory -RRB- by many people who take life seriously and look it squarely in the face , although the law g ^ ves the action no countenance , and the instinctive inheritance of many centuries of Christian civilization causes most of us to recoil with horror from the suggestion .

		And even those who are -RCB- -RRB- er - suaded to give theoretical approval to the principle would find it impossible to foimulate a safe working - rule for its application .

		We fancy that the con - sciousness of this difficulty , almost as much as the instinctive revolt against any violation of the sanctity of human life , helps to line up the professional moralists in a solid opposing phalanx whenever the humanitarian plea for mercy to the condemned suf - ferer is voiced .

		On the other hand , the sternest champion of the law , whether moral or civil , which forbids the taking of human life , would be likely to weaken inwardly when confronted by some partic - ularly heart-rending case of agony for which no na - tural end but death is possible , and which might be summarily ended with relief to all concerned .

		In such a case , the ethical philosophy which is no more than a calculus of pleasure and pain is apt to make all idealistic systems appear ineffectual .

		And the one who should , in such a case , translate this phil - osophy into action , although a criminal in the eyes of the law , would at least be entitled to a certain awful kind of sympathy .

		These are among the reflections that come to us whUe reading Mi-s .

		Whar - ton 's novel .

		As a conscious artist , she realizes that it is not her business to take sides , but rather to present a concrete example , and leave her readers • The Fruit of the Tree .

		to react upon it in their special modes of pity and indignation .

		It is such an example that she has presented , with moving effect , in '' The Fruit of the Tree . ''

		Perhaps we get as near as anywhere to the author 's point of ^ - iew in the following passage about the woman whose act is held before our gaze : '' She accepted the last condition as she had accepted the other , pledged to the perpetual expiation of an act for which , in the abstract , she stiU refused to hold herself to blame .

		But life is not a matter of abstract principles , but a succession of pitiful compromises with fate , of concessions to old tradition , old beliefs , old charities and frailties .

		That was what her act had taught her - -- that was the word of the gods to the moi-tal who had laid a hand on their bolts . ''

		He would be a harsh moralist , who , in the presence of the poignant tragedy portrayed in this book , should maintain that the woman 's punishment does not meas - ure up to her desert , and who should not be able to make large allowances for an act which , however inti'insicaUy horrible , is the outcome of the purest pity and the tenderest love .

		The great
San Francisco	LOCATION	earthquake now makes its appearance in fiction , serving as an effective climax to Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's new international novel .

		The book is entitled '' Ancestors , '' for no more dis - cernible reason than is offered by the fact that the heroine is of Spanish origin , and is supposed to exhibit certain ancestral traits .

		However , novelists nowadays are hard pressed for titles , and almost anything will serve .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's hero is a young Englishman in political life -- a sort of Rosebery-Cnrzon-ChurchiU blend -- who becomes a peer much to his disgust , and is thereby precluded from what has seemed to be his destined leadership of the Commons .

		The heroine is an American cousin from
California	LOCATION	, who at this juncture per - suades him to forsake English politics , come to
America	LOCATION	, and there carve out for himself a new career .

		About a third of the book is taken up by these preliminaries , and then the scene is shifted to
California	LOCATION	, where it remains for something over four hundred pages .

		The English peer becomes plain
John Gwynne	PERSON	, a rancher , and a student of political life in his new home .

		The fact that , by an accident of travel , he had been born in Vir ^ nia , permits him to claim American citizenship by a technicality , and supports the visionary suggestion that he may be eligible for the presidency .

		When the story closes , however , he has got no farther toward this goal than a sort of local leadership .

		But he gets his American cousin before the curtain falls , which is what the novel-reader chiefly demands .

		The strength of this book is found in its intimate depiction of
California	LOCATION	, both natural and social .

		Here the author is on firm ground -LRB- to speak with only figurative intent -RRB- , and writes whereof she knows , albeit with some exagger - ation and erudeness of coloring .

		But the story is made fairly tedious by endless passages of analysis and discussion , and its inordinate length is not justified by a corresponding richness of invention and imagination .

		Of its style there is not much ot 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, say .

		It exhibits rawness rather than refinement , and is ahnost wholly devoid of charm .

		Another novel of the international type is '' The Shuttle , '' by Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett	PERSON	.

		Here again we have a title with only the vaguest sort of relevancy , one that has to be justified by the occar sional insertion of figurative reflections upon the web of comity that fate is weaving between the shores of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		In the present case it is a snarl that is woven rather than a web , for the story starts with an international marriage that proves most distressing in its results .

		Suffice it to say tliat the bride , who is the daughter of an American magnate of fabulous wealth , is so cowed by the brutality of her noble and vicious spouse that she supinely places her fortune in his hands , ceases to communicate with her own family , and sinks into the position of a drudge , an unconsidered appendage of his decayed household .

		This situation is , of course , improbable to the verge of being preposterous , but it provides a setting for the main part of the story , which begins when Betty appears upon the scene .

		Betty is the younger sister of the abused wife , and as soon as she reaches the age of discretion , she starts for Eng - land on the mission , long cherished in secret , of dis - covering and rescuing the lost member of the family .

		She arrives at a time when the villainous husband is absent in parts unknown , grasps the situation , and presently dominates it .

		Her doings are of a nature to astonish the natives and everybody else , and when the husband re-appears , he discovers that he has a new member of his household , a rehabilitated estate , and a wife who shows signs of possessing a will of her own .

		These phenomena surprise him at first , and then make him more malignantly villainous than he had been before -- there can be no doubt that in this portrayal Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	gives us good measure .

		The element of sentimental romance in the book is pro- vided by
Betty	PERSON	's relations with a neighbor , an im - poverished nobleman , a figure of the taciturn-heroic type , whom everyone but
Betty	PERSON	misjudges .

		She dis - covers him to be a diamond of the purest water , al - though a rough one , and all is well in the end , save for the villain , with whom all is ill , yet not ill in proportion to his deserts .

		Betty seems to us an un - usually fine character ; fine , that is , in the sense of artistic and sympathetic portrayal .

		The story is a long one , and might be shortened to its advantage .

		Mr.
Friedman	PERSON	, in '' The Radical , '' gives us another variant upon the well-worn theme of the political leader engaged in the struggle with the hydra-headed -LRB- or octopus-footed -RRB- monster of corrup - tion .

		His hero makes his way upward by sheer strength of character and rugged honesty .

		After he has served his apprenticeship in munici -RSB- -RRB- al and state politics , he becomes a Representative at Wash - ington , and eventually a Senator .

		But after this , his career does not present the record of successful achievement so popular with the novelists who por - tray this type of character ; for our author gives us the novelty of a hero who is defeated in the end , and forced to succumb to the forces of evil arrayed against him .

		Probably Mr.
Friedman	PERSON	is not quite as pessi - mistic as this outcome would seem to indicate , for the closing page seems to hint that we are not through with the hero , whose last recorded words , as he departs from
Washington	LOCATION	, are to the effect that the
White House	ORGANIZATION	has both a front and a back door .

		Still , a story of this type which ends in de - feat is something of a novelty , and attention must be called to the fact .

		The scene of Mr.
Friedman	PERSON	's story is placed , for the most part , in the national capital , and it is evident that the author has spent some time there , note-book in hand .

		He is well - equipped with the facts of political life , and with the social 8ymJ -RRB- athies needed for their effective interpre - tation .

		He writes as an avowed spokesman of our present-day militant democracy , which is probably as biased , in its own way , as the effete aristocracy which it antagonizes .

		And we must add that the present book , in the details of its workmanship , is not as finished a production as the author 's previous writings would lead us to expect .

		Things happen to a sui-prising extent in the novels of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	, and more of them than usual happen in ``
Beth Norvell	PERSON	, '' his latest fiction .

		The scene is in the mining region of
Colorado	LOCATION	, the hero is a mining engineei ' , and the heroine a young woman who has run away from her villainous hus - band , and is supporting herself by enacting various parts as leading lady of a theatrical company .

		The hero succumbs when he first sees her , and applies for a position as scene-shifter and general utility man with her troupe .

		This enables him to be on hand at various critical junctm-es , and he knows how to utilize his opportunities .

		In the end the villain is conveniently disposed of , and all is well .

		It is all melodrama of a rather preposterous sort , and the hero 's conversation is a little more prepos - terous than anything else in the book .

		Another story of the West , but one considerably more serious in artistic intent , is `` Money Magic , '' by Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	.

		The hero is a reformed gambler and the heroine an emancipated `` biscuit - shooter . ''

		The gambler reforms because that is the condition the '' biscuit ^ shooter '' imposes upon him , and her emancipation is from the drudgery of the country hotel in which her days have been spent .

		Just as this arrangement has been effected between the two , a '' bad man '' gets the gambler off his guard , and `` fills him with lead . ''

		-LRB- We drop into these playful idioms as a natural consequence of associa - tion with the unspoiled figures of Western romance . -RRB-

		The gambler is supposed to be on his death-bed , and a marriage is hastily contrived ; but he unexpectedly recovers , although remaining a cripple .

		The couple now remove to the
Springs	LOCATION	, where they occupy a jjalatial residence , and get into `` society . ''

		The woman develops possibilities , which a young lawyer -LRB- who now comes into the foreground -RRB- is quick to per - ceive .

		Various affecting scenes then follow , grow - ing out of the wife 's struggle with her awakened self , and the pathetic self-effacement of the husband .

		The effacement is finally made complete , and the story

		THE DIAL .

		319 ends with a new life in prospect for his widow .

		There is a certain amount of truth in this narrative , and fairly effective characterization , although the latter most be described as crude rather than subtle .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has done much better work than this , and will , we trust , do it again . ''

		Whatever thy task , thou art even as one who twists the thread and throws the shuttle weaving the web of Life .

		Ye are all weavers , and Allah the Merciful , does He not watch beside the loom ? ''

		This impressive quotation -LRB- is it from the Koran ? -RRB-

		at once introduces and sets the keynote for `` The Weavers , '' a new novel by .

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	.

		The words presage breadth of treatment and a serious nnderljang purpose .

		Their omen is not without fulfilment , for the author has embodied their mes - sage in a work that , despite certain quite obvious faults , is nevertheless endowed with unity of design and fine idealism .

		The faults may be dismissed with a few words .

		They are found in a somewhat heavy and repetitious style , an excess of melo - dramatic action and of Egyptian local color , and an element of what is intended to be comic relief , provided by a stray American whose language and conduct are alike impossible .

		Allowing for all these things , there remains a tale of varied and absorbing interest , the most ambitious and probably the most successful of Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	's writings .

		The story is of
Egypt	LOCATION	fifty years ago , but of an
Egypt	LOCATION	brought into such relations with
England	LOCATION	as to justify the large share of attention given to English scenes and characters .

		The author has imagined a young Englishman of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	nurture , transferred by acci - dent , as it were , to the Egyptian court , and placed in a position of such responsibility that the destinies of the country are in his hands .

		There is a little of Lord
Cromer	PERSON	and a good deal of
Gordon	PERSON	in his make-up , and his career is in many respects strik - ingly like that of the last-named Englishman , whose personality and situation in the eighties have been borrowed for the uses of this romance of the sixties .

		Particularly is this description true of the relations between our
Quaker David	PERSON	and the home govern - ment , which supports him in a half-hearted way , and finally abandons him to his fate .

		More fortunate than
Gordon	PERSON	, however , he is saved from his desper - ate peril , and his enemies are routed when all hope seems lost .

		This situation provides a tense climax for a work that lays a strong hold upon our sympa - thies , and that depicts , in a manner that is something more than superficial , the sharp contrast , if not the deep essential antagonism , between East and
West	LOCATION	.

		Sir
GUbert	PERSON	is a man of the world whose thought is tinged by poetic imagination , and it is to this unusual combination that the effectiveness of his work is due . ''

		Lord
Cammarleigh	PERSON	's Secret '' is a diverting tale by Mr.
Roy Horniman	PERSON	.

		By way of anticipating its strain upon the reader 's credulity it is styled `` a fairy story of to-day '' upon the title-page , and with this warning we are measurably prepared to be sur - prised .

		Granted , however , a single initial impossi - bility , the story goes on smoothly and naturally enough ; and this , we take it , represents a more artistic metho < l of dealing with the impossible than that which demands our acceptance of new miracles in every chapter .

		The hero is an audacious youth of parts , introduced to us upon the verge of starvation .

		At his wits ' ends , he one day comes across Lord ' Cammarleigh , whom he has never seen before , notes a look of terror upon his face , and whispers to him dramatically : '' I know your secret . ''

		Thereupon he is at once taken into his lordship 's household , installed as private secretary , given the power of the purse , and made practically master of position and fortune .

		He uses the opportunity to such excellent effect that he eventually marries an aristocratic I maiden , gets a seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	, and sequestrates for his own benefit a large share of
Cammarleigh	ORGANIZATION	's fortune .

		As for the secret , he never finds it out , and , what is worse , even the reader gets no hint of its nature .

		But it is dark and deadly enough to make Cammerleigh a puppet in the hero 's hands , and to give ns the delight of following the career of a particidarly eng ^ aging adventurer .

		The hittory of tlavery m
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Since the reversal in our foreign and colonial policies which has taken place since
1898	DATE	, American students are devoting more attention to the history of
Latin	LOCATION	-
America	LOCATION	.

		The most recent product of investigation in that field is '' A Historj ' of .

		Slaverj - in
Cuba	LOCATION	,
1511	DATE	to 1868 '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by
Herbert H. S. Aimes	PERSON	.

		The title is too comprehensive , since the only subject treated is the slave-trade to
Cuba	LOCATION	, legal and illegal .

		The author traces the history of the trade from the beginning to the end , describing the policy of
Spain	LOCATION	, the desires of the Cuban planters , the methods of the traders , attempts at suppression , and the slave - trade in international politics , with here and there some remarks upon the economic situation in
Cuba	LOCATION	and its relation to the slave trafiSc In a sense , this is a scholarly work .

		It is the result of much labor , and is based upon the best authorities , Spanish , French , and English , both documentary and printed .

		But the narrative in which the author presents the results of his work is something fearful and wonder - ful in its raw and careless crudeness .

		It would seem that no effort was made to give the work a clear and readable form .

		At times it is difficult to under - stand the author 's meaning ; there is unnecessary word coining ; technical terms are not sufficiently explained ; quotations are not well introduced , and indirect quotations are in bad form ; too many minute facts are given , and not enough effort is exerted to work them into a logical narrative , -- in fact , the author seems to have lost himself in his mass of details .

		But in spite of all these defects , we can dig out , with the author 's assistance , certain general conclusions , such as these : the Spanish government was desirous of limiting the slave trade : 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the Cuban planters wanted more slaves than they were permitted to import , though at times they showed a lively sense of the danger of having large numbers of negroes ; but few female slaves were imported for a long time , and thus the slave trade was considered more necessary ; though illegal after about
1820	DATE	, it was practically impossible to prevent the smuggling in of slaves in large numbers .

		Of enlightening comment and well developed conclu - sions , there is a distinct lack .

		There is no descrip - tion of the plantation economy in
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		The point of view of the author is unusual : he writes of the slave-trade in exactly the same spirit that he would write of the sugar-trade ; there is no horror of the ti-affic , no preaching , no apology , no defense or attack .

		Throughout the book one finds expressed the author 's opinion that for the development of
Cuba	LOCATION	slave labor was needed and
Spain	LOCATION	should have allowed unlimited traffic in
Africans	LOCATION	-- an opinion not warranted by the experience of the past nor proved sound by conditions of to-day .

		Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's `` Tennyson '' artrdi ^ r ^ af ; . '

		-LRB- D'ltton -RRB- is written with a threefold object , -- '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- to give a simple narrative of the life of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, with a sketch of his temperament , character , ideals , and beliefs ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- I have tried from his own words and writings to indicate what I believe to have been his view of the poetical life and character ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- 1 have attempted to touch the chief characteristics of his art from the technical point of view , here again as far as possible using his own recorded words . ''

		The book gives us Mr.
Benson	PERSON	at his best , lingering in the quiet of his study over the pages of a beloved author , and desir - ing , as he says , '' to share with others an inheritance of pure and deep delight . ''

		Nothing new is offered , or attempted , in the brief outline of the poet 's life , nor is there anything novel or startling in the dis - cussion of his works and his art ; but a quiet sym - pathy , a genial appreciation , pervades the book and makes it most enjoyable , even inspiring , reading .

		The author holds with
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, and with many less critical readers , that
Tennyson	PERSON	's early poems were his best , that his '' real gift was the lyric g ^ ft , '' and that '' while he continued careless of name and fame he served his own ideal best . ''

		In charging
Tennyson	PERSON	with obscurity in the speeches he puts into the mouths of his characters , as in '' The Princess '' and the '' Idylls '' -- an obscurity even surpassing that of
Browning	PERSON	-- he goes too far .

		Tennyson never throws grammar and syntax to the winds , nor does he make his verse stagger under a load of obscure and unimportant Italian allusion .

		Some of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's terse and humorous comments on his brother poets throw gleams of light on the concep - tion he had of his art .


Wordsworth	PERSON	, for his lack of fire , seemed to him '' thick-ankled '' ; of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	he said , '' To me he appears to move in a wide sea of glue '' ; and
Horace	PERSON	's Sapphic stanza , he used to declare , '' is like a pig with its tail tightly curled . ''

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's style is , as usual , of so scholarly an Factort in modern history .

		excellence that it is a little disturbing to catch him writing of a '' perspicuous critic . ''

		Surely , so accom - plished a classicist ought not to ignore the distinction between perspicuus and perspicax .

		The inter - spersed comments on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's metres tend to show what an amazing command of his instrument the poet had .

		In fact , the whole book sends one back to the poems themselves with increased admi - ration and renewed zest . ''

		Factors in Modern History '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- is the promising though some - what indefinite title of a recently published volume of lectures by the eminent English historian , Professor
A. F. Pollard	PERSON	of
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's purpose is , however , not so broad as the title-page would suggest : his aun is to point out and discuss the nature of the forces that directed the course and shaped the events of English history during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , the
Tudor	PERSON	and
Stuart	PERSON	periods .

		The work is therefore not a history as that word is commonly understood ; it is not a re-statementof historic events , but an effort to bring out the significance that lies beneath the ordinary well-known facts of the period under discussion .

		Among other '' factors , '' the author discusses nationality , the rise of the middle class , the growth of parliamentary independence , the new monarchy , conflicting religious and political ideas , and colonial expansion .

		On some of these subjects Professor
Pollard	PERSON	offers little that is either novel or startling , but in every case the manner of treatment is interesting and suggestive .

		Of greatest interest is the author 's review of the early Tudor period , in which he re-states the conclusions published in his biographies of
Cranmer	PERSON	,
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, and the Pro- tector
Somerset	LOCATION	.

		He still holds that while
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		was only in a minor degree responsible for the Anglican reformation , he was directly responsible for the growth of parliamentary vigor and inde - pendence that proved so fatal to the pretensions of the Stuarts .

		As he reads the records , there was more tyranny , more coercion , more interference with parliamentary freedom , in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	than in that of her father .

		It will interest the reader to note that to emphasize the virtues of the `` flexible '' British constitution Professor
Pollard	PERSON	contrasts it with our own , under which neither
House	ORGANIZATION	nor ministry '' can remove the other ; they can only annoy one another , and impede one another 's action until the period preordained by the Constitution has elapsed . ''

		The work closes with a lecture on the present condition of historic study at
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	, which is interesting for its own sake , but hardly belongs in a volume devoted to the '' factors in modern history . ''

		A word should be added in appreciation of the author 's literary style : the reviewer recalls no other discus - sion that brings out the humor of history so freely and so delightfully .

		Professor
Pollard	PERSON	's latest work is one that lovers of history will read with enjoy - ment as well as with profit .

		^ ^ ^ jj jg jjjjg unabashed admission of all that is charged against him that makes him a rather piquantly interesting and oddly amusing figure to contemplate in the brief study of his life and work offered by Mr.
Holbrook Jackson	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. G. W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Conceiving that the press and the public have failed to understand Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and to take him with sufficient seriousness .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	has presented him .

		carefully and admir - ingly drawn , in fourfold phase , -- `` The Man , '' `` The Fabian , '' * ■ The Plaj-wright , '' and '' The Philosopher . ''

		The book is well written , and , in its biographical pages esj -RRB- ecially , highly entertaining .

		Its subject is certainly a man of unusual endowments , and is just now making himself heard in tones that men can not , or will not , shut their ears to .

		As the author says that ` Six .

		Shaw looks upon himself , not primarily as an artist , but as a philosopher , we need not here pass judgment on his books and plays , but may content ourselves with querying whether his philosophy , despite the attention it is now commanding , will prove to have in it anything of permanent worth .

		He wakes up the drowsy , and makes them gasp and stare ; but -LRB- to use the language of pragmatism -RRB- new truth , in order to vindicate its claim to be truth at all , must not merely be novel and forward-reaching , but must at the same time be sufficiently in harmony with old and accepted truth to coalesce with it and grow naturally from it .

		Nature makes no leaps , and your saltimhanque is a prodigious leaper .

		In other words , are we ready to throw overboard the greater number of our cherished ideals , to hold with this new philosopher that ' • duty is what one should never do , '' to bow down to the Life-force as the supreme object of our worship , to intermit our homage to cour - age and justice and fidelity and ehastit -RCB- - , and all the other old-fashioned virtues ?

		Shall we cease to demand in our prophets and teachers that modest dignity and self-respecting reserve that seem to us -LRB- whether rightly or wrongly -RRB- so sadly lacking in the brilliant author of '' Man and Superman '' ?

William Elliot woTid-raef	PERSON	.

		GrifiBs , the well-known writer on Japanese affairs , is a popular resuml of the impor - tant events in the history of
Japan	LOCATION	, from the earliest times to the beginning of the present year .

		The author is conceded to be the best informed
Ameri	PERSON	- can on the subject concerning which he writes .

		He was the first of that army of foreigners -LRB- the number is not less than five thousand -RRB- who have been called into the service of
Japan	LOCATION	in pursuance of the cele - brated Charter Oath taken by the
Mikado	LOCATION	in

January , 1871	DATE	.

		Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	is an enthusiastic ad - mirer of the Japanese , and his story of the growth of their civilization , to which he has contributed no small share himself , is marked by a spirit of genuine svmpathy and good-will .

		Of the influence exerted by foreigners in
Japan	LOCATION	, he says , they not only sowed the first seeds of faiowledge , but that they created new sciences , inaugurated railroad and telegfraph sys - tems , built steamships and lighthouses , and in a thou - sand ways taught the Japanese how to utilize the forces of nature , develop their national resources , and improve the condition of man .

		He considers the Japanese the most '' improvable '' race in
Asia	LOCATION	, if not in the world .

		In spirit , body , institutions , mental initiative , and methods of life , they are , Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	declares , radically un-Mongolian , and should not be classed as Mongolians ; indeed , they refuse to be classed as such .

		He praises the alliance with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and says the Japanese owe the British peo - ple more than money for their friendship .

		Of
Japan	LOCATION	's position as a world-power .

		Dr.
Grifhs	PERSON	writes interestingly .

		He denies that her statesmen are ani - mated by any policy of aggression , and affirms that her highest ambition is self-preservation .

		The author has treated the ancient worthies in small compass , and devotes most of his book to a consid - eration of what has been done in this science during tbe last fifty years .

		Before that time , astronomical progress was associated almost entirely with the greatest exponents of the science , and the treatment of the subject is therefore almost necessarily bio - graphical .

		But during the past fifty years there have been so many worthy workers in various astro - nomical fields that the biographical treatment of the earlier times is supplemented by a topical one .

		Here wide and accurate knowledge is shown by the author , who brings the discussion of each topic thoroughly down to date ; in one case he inserts some informa - tion gained while the book was being printed .

		The reader is thus led to feel that the presentation is thoroughly modem .

		Upon disputed topics , like that of the supposed inhabitability of Mars , a conserva - tive opinion is expressed .

Scott Oliver	PERSON	's ``
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, point of riew .

		an E ^ say on American Union '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- gives opportunity to express renewed appre - ciation of this study of our Revolutionarj - and early national history from the English point of view .

		The author is a careful and judicial student , and the study is valuable in itself ; but its chief value comes from the outside treatment of the period that has been most idealized by our own writers .

		The reader sometimes receives a mild shock when the traditional ideals are treated irreverently ; but the 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, treatment is never flippant .

		It seems impossible for any American writer to discuss the character and achievements of
Hamilton	LOCATION	without enthusiastic admiration or violent denunciation , according to the writer 's political bias , so positive was
Hamilton	PERSON	's character and so striking his achievements .

		Mr.
Oliver	PERSON	is an ardent admirer without partisan pre - judices , seeing in
Hamilton	LOCATION	the guiding intellect in national affaii-s during the whole period of his ac - tivity .

		Rather scanty weight is allowed even to
Washingfton	LOCATION	's influence and initiative .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Ancient Hebrew Literature , '' in four volumes , edited by the Rev.
R. Bruce Taylor	PERSON	, is a welcome addition to the '' Everyman 's Library '' of the Messrs. Button .

		It is simply an edition of the Old Testament and
Apocryplia	LOCATION	, the books classified under such heads as law , history , philosophy , and poetry , and printed without artificial division into chapters and verses .

		The authorized ver - sion is the basis of the text , although absolute mistrans - lations are corrected .

		This set of volumes , together with the New Testament volume edited for the same series by Principal
Lindsay	PERSON	, gives us a complete Bible that may be read as another book , with eyes unvexed by the typographical devices that make hard readmg of the Scriptures in the ordinary form of publication .

		A new volume has been added to the late
Philip SchafE	PERSON	's '' History of the Christian Church , '' the labor of cai ` rying on the work having been undertaken by his son , Dr.
David S. Sehafl	PERSON	.

		The special period of this volume is the Middle Ages , and , with another volume now in press , the work will be brought down to the Reformation .

		Thus the lacima left in the history by
Philip Schaif	ORGANIZATION	's death will be filled , and the continuous history , in eight volumes , will be available for study and reference .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the pub - lishers of this , as of the precediugvoliunes . ''

		A Book of Quotations , Proverbs , and Household Words , '' edited by Mr.
W. Gurney Beuham	PERSON	, is a stout volume of more than twelve hundred pages , published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is described as `` a collec - tion of what is quotable , as well as of what is quoted . ''

		The first third of the book is given up to quotations from individual authore ; then we have groups of quotations imder various miscellaneous categories , and then neai-ly three hmidred pages of quotations from foreign lan - guages , ancient and modern .

		An extensive selection of pi-overbs follows , and an elaborate verbal index com - pletes the work .

		We know no other book of the kiud that contains so much matter , and we can heartily rec - ommend it as an additiou to the reference shelf . ''

		Narratives of
Early Virginia	LOCATION	'' is a new volume in the series of ''
Original Narratives of Early American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It is appropriately and intelligently edited by the Presi - dent of the oldest of
Virginia	LOCATION	colleges .

		Dr.
Lyon Gardiner Tyler	PERSON	.

		Selections from the doughty
John Smith	PERSON	fill about two-thirds of the volume ; the remain - ing contents include narratives and letters by
George Percy	PERSON	, Lord De-la ^ Ware ,
Don Diego de Molina	PERSON	, Father
Biard	PERSON	,
John	PERSON	R '' fe , and
John Pory	PERSON	.

		The period covered is that from the first settlement to the dissolution of the Company in
1624	DATE	by the aggrieved monarch .

		The Great Galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	'' is the title of a series of booklets started by the

		They are books of pictures with practically no text , and the subjects of the four now issued are the
Louvre	LOCATION	, the
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Tate Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		What is probably the most desirable edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poems is offered by the volume which forms a part of the edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's works , in ten volumes , edited by Messrs.
Stedman	PERSON	and Woodberry a dozen years ago .

		The volume of the poems is now pubUslied separately by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Books about the music-dramas of Richard
Wagner	PERSON	multiply apace .

		We now have '' The Wagnerian Ro - mances , '' by Miss

		From Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have '' The Story of the Ring , '' by Mr.

		Two new volumes , '' Toledo '' and ''

		Each of these volumes , in addition to the text , contains about five him - dred full-page photographic plates .

		The series is pub - lished by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		385 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 390 MONCURE D ANIE L
CONWAY	PERSON	.

		It was a rich life , and a helpful one , that ended when Dr.
Conway	PERSON	died in
Paris	LOCATION	, on the fifteenth of
last month	DATE	.

		It had covere < l just three - quarters of a century , and had entered into active relations with many of the most signi - ficant developments and personalities of the period .

		He said in his Autobiography published three years ago : '' The eventualities of life brought me into close con - nection with some large movements of my time , and also with incidents little noticed when they oecnrred , which time has proved of more far-reaching effect than the immediately imposing events .

		I have been brought into personal relations with leading minds and characters which already are becoming quasi-classic figures to the youth around me , and already show the nsoal tendency of such figures to invest themselves with mythology . ''

		A life which may be described in such terms as these can not fail to be of deep and instructive interest , and , now that its accounts are closed , many readers shoidd wish to make acquaintance , renewed or original , with the volumes which con - tain its autobiographical record .

		Few volumes of the kind are of equal interest , or equally deserving of thoughtful consideration .

		Probably the most essential characteristic of Dr.
Conway	PERSON	's life was its open-mindedness , and the accompanying determination to know the truth of whatever matters occupied his atten - tion .

		A man must be singularly honest with himself to be able to escape , as completely as this man did , from the prison-house of wont and prepossession , to construct anew his per - sonal habitation of clear thinking and right living .

		Starting on his career as a narrow evangelical -- a circuit-rider in ilaryland -- he became a powerful exponent of liberal religious thought ; bom into a slaveholding family , and inheriting the prejudices of his social class , he became an impassioned ally of the abolitionists , incidentally liberating his own family slaves , and finding a new home for them on the free soil of
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The readiness , thus illustrated , to let thought have its way , and to square the action with the idea , was the controlling prin - ciple of the noble life now brought to its close , and constitutes its fundamental title to our respect .

		The events of Dr.
Conway	PERSON	's early life may be very briefly smnmarize < l.
Dickinson College	ORGANIZATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, was his alma mater , and gradu - 864 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ated him at the age of seventeen .

		He studied law for a time , then went into the ministry .

		His adoption of Unitarianism was made at about the time when he became of age , and the change in his religious outlook was largely due to the influence of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		This year of his majority he spent the
summer	DATE	at
Concord	LOCATION	, where he met the gentle sage with whom he was to become so intimately associated .

		A year of study in the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	followed ; it was the year of the
Anthony Burns	PERSON	episode and of the Kansas-Nebraska bill , which matters confirmed the young man in his anti-slavery principles .

		During the next seven years , he occupied Uni - tarian pastorates in
Washington	LOCATION	and
Cincin	PERSON	- nati .

		The
Washington	LOCATION	incumbency ended with a '' fatal sermon , '' too outspoken for the slavery interest to stomach , and the preacher , charged with `` desecration of his pulpit , '' was promptly dismissed .

		He removed to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	, and it was there that he was married .

		It was also there that he edited '' The Dial , '' second of that name , a monthly magazine which lived exactly one year .

		The outbreak of the Civil War brought Dr.
Conway	PERSON	to the
East	LOCATION	again , and engaged him in many intellectual and humane activities in the cause of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, which was to him emphat - ically the cause of freedom .

		Soon after the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect , he accepted an offer from
England	LOCATION	to lecture in that country .

		He thus entered upon what was to be a foreign sojourn of more than twenty years , during which time he acted as minister of the
South Place Chapel	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, besides doing much work in journalism , scholarship , and lit - erature .

		He sums up in these words his record up to the time of his change of residence : `` I had said my say in
America	LOCATION	; I had borne my testimony , as the Quakers say , in all the towns of
Ohio	LOCATION	, in every important town of
New England	LOCATION	, and in the chief cities of
New York	LOCATION	, in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and surround - ing places , and in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		I had written innum - erable articles and letters in papers and magazines , and my two books on the crisis were in wide circulation .

		It appeared , therefore , a fair time for me to go for a few months to represent the moral and political situation as viewed by American anti-slavery people . ''

		The life of the score of years that followed , as we read of it in the Autobiography , is rich in many kinds of interest .

		Dr.
Conway	PERSON	had the social instinct to a remarkable degree , and his combination of intellectual force with sweetness of temper won for him both the respect and the affection of a great number of the leading spirits of the time , on the Continent as well as in
England	LOCATION	.

		In
1875	DATE	, Dr.
Conway	PERSON	made a vacation visit to the
United States	LOCATION	, but it was not until
1884	DATE	that he finally severed relations with his
London	LOCATION	congregation , and came home for good .

		This latter statement , however , needs much qualifica - tion , for he continued to make frequent journeys abroad , and , as we have seen , it was in a foreign land that his career came to an end .

		How far afield his wanderings took him appears from '' My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East , '' that fascinating supplement to a fascinating Autobiography .

		His deep interest in the oriental religions made him eager to study them at first hand , and enter into personal relations with their leading exponents .

		Long before he made this pilgrimage he had published '' The Sacred An - thology , '' a collection of passages from the great religious writings of the
East	LOCATION	, which had been one of his most widely-circulated books .

		Other books resiUting from his studies in comparative religion were '' Deraonology and Devil Lore , '' '' The Wandering Jew , '' and ''
Solomon	PERSON	and Solomonic Literature . '

		The literary activities of his later years were mainly devoted to subjects connected with American history .

		He had seen some of the most important parts of American history in the making , and had been deeply impressed with the fact that every historical happening tends to become quickly obscured by legend .

		In particular , he knew well from his own expe - rience how widely variant from the truth was the popular or legendary idea of the Civil War and its chief actors that had come to be gen - erally accepted a generation later .

		When he turned to make researches in our earlier annals , he kept this lesson at heart , and in the true spirit of exact scholarship went straight to the docu - mentary sources and did not allow traditions to cloud his vision or impair his judgment .

		His method is exemplified by his biographies of
Edmund Randolph	PERSON	and
Thomas Paine	PERSON	.

		His life of
Paine	LOCATION	, in fact , together with his critical edi - tion of
Paine	PERSON	's writings , constitutes the chief literary monument of Dr.
Conway	PERSON	's career .

		It revealed the subject as he really was , and dis - ` pelled forever from all serious minds the bogy thatf or generations had been on pulpit exhibition for the pointing of a cheap and sensational moral .

		Dr.
Conway	PERSON	's books , unless we except the Autobiography , will not perpetuate his memory with the wider public .

		His voluminous output of writing was either frankly ephemeral or nar - rowly specialized , and these are not the qualities that make for lasting fame .

		But the memory of his personality will be cherished for at least

		THE DIAI .

		8 `` & another generation by those who were privileged to hold intercourse with him .

		He was one of the best of talkers and one of the sincerest of friends , and his s -RCB- ^ npathies radiated upon all who came within their range .

		He will be missed in his familiar haunts -- the Century , and the Authors , and the homes that knew him as a loved and honored guest .

		But the sadness caused by his death wiU be tempered by the thought that he lived his life fully , and made the world abetter place than it would have been without him .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NAVAL CAPTAIN AND A LITERARY STYLIST are UOt every day encountered in one and the same person ; but this unusual combination exists in Captain
Alfred T. Mahan	PERSON	, whose books owe no small part of their popu - larity to the graceful and readable style in which they are written .

		In his new volume , '' From Sail to Steam , '' one of the personally reminiscent chapters treats of the author 's development of his own medium of expression , and shows that , whatever he may believe as to the poet , he holds that the prosateur is bom and made .

		With Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, he would reject the first spontaneous utter - ance and substitute the embellished and full-rounded period .

		His remarks , the fruit of his own experience as a writer , are of interest to anyone who holds a pen ; and is there anybody who does not ?

		At the same time , just as one takes a malicious pleasure in convicting a gram - marian of a solecism , so one feels a mischievous tempta ^ tion to expose one or two little faults of style in this admirable writer 's observations on style .

		Among the '' minute details '' that seem to him '' worthy of the ut - most care '' is the following : '' to avoid an adjective which belongs to one of two nouns being so placed as to seem to qualify both . '' ''

		To avoid an adjective 's being placed '' would be correct -LRB- so the purists say -RRB- although awkward ; better , '' to avoid placing , '' etc. , or '' never to place , '' etc. .

		The Captain tells us that he abhors the split infinitive , and we are not very fond of it ourselves ; but he also shuns the relative '' that . ''

		In this we think he deprives himself of a useful and indeed almost indispensable word .

		Where the relative clause completes the mean - ing of the antecedent , '' that '' is the proper pronoun to use , though '' which '' is often allowed to take its place .

		If the Captain will permit one further suggestion , would it not be well to make more generous provision for the sup - port of one 's present participles ?

		To leave a poor parti - ciple all alone , with no friendly noun or pronoun to lean against , is almost cruel .

		For example , in his recent entertaining magazine article on '' Old-time Naval Offi - cers , '' our author says , speaking of the flag-officer and himself : '' Going ashore one day with him for a constitu - tional , he caught sight of my necktie , '' etc. .

		The sense is plain enough , but '' going '' agrees with neither '' he '' nor `` necktie '' ; in fact , its hopeless disagreement amounts to a sort of grammatical dyspepsia .

		Again , ten lines further down the page : `` Going ashore together one day for a walk , the surgeon smudged his clothes , '' etc. .

		Once more : '' Judging by my experience , ... the life of an aide is literally that of a dog . ''

		How simple and satisfying to have put '' judged '' instead of '' judg - I ing '' !

		But of course all this is unimportant .

		Perhaps , like the higher mathematics , this grammatical haLv splitting has a fascination inversely proportional to its utility ... Miss
Alma-Tadema	PERSON	's sunny philosophy finds pleasant expression in her reported conversation regard - ing her forthcoming book on the simple life , the ethical basis of happiness , and kindred themes of interest to the homely philosopher that dwells in each one of us . ''

		This book of mine , '' she is quoted as saying , ■ ' has never been published , and I came over here to give a few readings from it because I have always loved to read , and because I wanted to see my friends here , and I thought that would be a pleasant waj ' of doing it .

		My book is n't at all a practical handbook of happmess .

		Perhaps some day I shall write a more practical book on the subject ; but it seemed to me the ethical part , the spiritual basis , came first . ''

		To
Miss Alma-Tadema	PERSON	, happiness is very much what
Boston	LOCATION	is to the true Bostonian .

		Just as to him
Boston	LOCATION	is not a geogi-aphical locality but rather a state of mind , so to this cheerful lady happiness is '' something quite apart from outward circumstances ; it is a matter of the mind , '' and , '' if we have the right attitude of mind nothing can make us really unhappy . ''

		She does admit , however , after experience of an
Atlantic	LOCATION	voyage , that '' seasickness damps one 's ardor for life , though it does n't last long . ''

		As to loneliness , she says : '' I do n't see how one can be lonely when there is always Nature ; but I believe the best happiness comes from being always ready to give friend - ship and fellowship and affection , and to receive it . ''

		In all this , and in more which we do not quote , there is sanity and sense that could hardly be improved upon -- unless one were to '' beat the Dutch '' ; for Miss
Laurence Alma-Tadema	PERSON	is the daughter of a Dutch father -LRB- as everyone knows -RRB- , and so , if not exactly a daughter of
Holland	LOCATION	, is at least a granddaughter of that brave little country ... A NEW LIBRARY JOURNAL is one of the palpable results of the recent thirtieth annual convention of the
British Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		Some time before that event , the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	had sent out a circular to the public libraries of the kingdom , urging their cooperation with the
National Home Reading Union	ORGANIZATION	in furthering the interests common to both .

		The outcome of this and subsequent agitation and discussion has now appeared in the shape of an invit - ing monthly magazine called '' The Readers ' Review , '' which will treat not only of matters pertaining espe - cially to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but also of such themes as the libraries subscribing to it shall choose to bring forward for discussion ; and it will thus serve as the official organ of the local library at the same time that it stands for the larger interests of the
Home Reading Union	ORGANIZATION	and of public libraries throughout the land .

		The
Union	ORGANIZATION	undertakes to provide sixteen pages of literary matter and important news items , and the Library Asso - ciation is invited to nominate an editorial committee as its own representative -- or perhaps to take entire charge of the editorship .

		This point is not quite clear to us .

		Book-lists and local advertisements are spoken of as to be forthcoming from the various subscribing libraries , and these libraries may either sell or distribute gratui - tously the copies for which they subscribe .

		The saving in printing expenses to the several libraries by this coop - erative action , and the gain expected from advertise - ments , will more than pay for the copies of the period - 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ical taken by the cooperating libraries .

		It is reported that the scheme has already met with favor from some of the principal boroughs in the kingdom , although
London	LOCATION	itself is moving slowly in the matter .

		The whole plan illustrates for us our British cousins ' superior aptitude and fondness for cooperation .

		In cooperative schemes they are a long lead ahead of us .

		• • • Public library borrowers of fiction are much fewer in proportion to the whole number of public - library patrons , than au unthinking reader of circulation statistics would infer .

		For example , the
Grand Rapids Public Library	ORGANIZATION	mmibers about 15,000 card-holders ; but in the past year , as has been ascertained , only 3890 of these persons drew fiction , while of this number 1050 , or barely seven per cent of the library 's patrons , drew more than sixty per cent of all the novels drawii , and 152 drew sixteen per cent .

		Therefore the familiar re - port that two-thirds , or three-quarters , or four-flfths , of a library 's total circulatioi ; has been fiction , need not induce gloomy apprehensions of a softening of the public brain .

		Probably not more than a quarter of the card - holders -- and those largely in the sentimental stage of their adolescence -- are readers of novels only .

		In - deed , it is probable that not - so many as one-quarter read nothing more serious than story-books from Jan - uary to
December	DATE	; and even readers of innumerable novels may actually spend more time over a few serious books than over fiction in the course of the year .

		Ten historical or scientific works might easily demand more hours of reading and study than a hundred novels of the day .

		The latter are often run through at odd moments as a '' rest cure , '' after strenuous intellectual labors .

		Furthermore , hundreds and thousands of novels are taken from the library and returned imread or but partly read .

		A chapter , a page , a turning of the leaves per - haps , or a glance at the end , may convince the borrower that the book has no meat for him , and back it goes .

		While , then , signs of serious-mindedness are always to be welcomed m public-library patrons , there is no cause for despair in statistical evidences of even a greatly disproportionate borrowing of fiction .

		• • • The status of the librarian as the representa - tive of a learned profession was commented upon by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	in his speech at the recent laying of the comer-stone of a new library building in
Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		He deplored especially the low estimation in which librarians are held in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and urged a more generous recognition of their services .

		These words of the
Laird	PERSON	of Skibo the Secretary of the Library Assistants ' Associa - tion regards asalmost equivalent to insult added to injury . ''

		From Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, `` he says in the Association 's official journal , '' such remarks are simply amusing , seeing that by building bookless , incomeless libraries , he has done more than any man to bring ill-equipped men into the profession .

		A
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	provincial library that can not afford books can not afford to pay a professional libra - rian , and the man appointed is simply another unfit recruit .

		The satire of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's is even more biting when he compares the superior technical training of the American librarian with ours , seeing that he has never lifted a fmger in this country for the education of the librarian . ''

		Without heartily applauding the cen - sorious tone of this utterance , one may appropriately enough urge that the admitted zeal and unselfishness of library workers deserve more handsome recognition , in terms of dollars and cents , both from the private benefactor and from the public treasury .

		Librarian - ships , like professorships , might well be endowed .

		This by way of suggestion to any man of millions who is haunted with the fear of dying disgracefully rich .

		• • • The disadvantages of UNIVERSALCULTURE , granted the possibility of the whole world 's ever attaining to what we here and now regard as culture , must have suggested themselves to many an idle muser As a man thinks , so is he .

		A world in which all nations and races cher - ished the same ideals and thought the same thoughts would be insufferably monotonous .

		For one thing , would not all men come to look alike ?

		Even as it is , with the spread of international communication and the inter - change of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western ideas , national types are said to be disappearing , and all mankind is assunmig , or in danger of assumuig , a dreary sameness of linea - ment and expression .

		A German artist who makes a speciality of studying the lines and features of the hu - man face declares that we are all getting to be as like as peas in a pod .

		The final result will be the composite human being , like the composite photog ^ ph ; and the standardized face , like the standardized railway , the standardized flour-barrel , or -LRB- terrible thought -RRB- the stand - ardized spelling .

		Already this student of physiognomy finds the same characteristics in Irishmen as in American Indians , and in the
Esquimaux	LOCATION	as in the Japanese .

		However , this retrogi'ade movement from complexity and differentiation and specialization back to primal uniformity and sameness will not go very far in our day and generation .

		One can comfortingly say to oneself , as one does in estimating the probable duration of the sun 's heat , '' The world will last out my time , any way . ''

		• • • The
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	craze for spelling-reform reached its climax in the late formal acceptance by the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	, in council assembled , of one hundred and eighty '' reformed '' words .

		These redeemed repro - bates , having been brought to see the error of their ways , having put off the old man , which is unphonetic , and put on the new , which is created in the office of the
Spelling-Reform Association	ORGANIZATION	, are henceforth admitted to good and regular standing in the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	vocabu - larj - .

		But no puuishmeut -- neither suspension nor expul - sion , nor even so much as a censure -- will be inilicted on those students who still prefer the unregenerate spelling .

		The list invites a few comments .

		Shorter and simpler than a catalogue of words in - or would have been an enumeration of those in - our , if any such are to be sanctioned .

		If gipsy , then why not Egi/itian , since the two are etymologically the same ?

		But perhaps the omission is due to the latter 's being a proper noun .

		Whisky is perhaps a logical concession to the now general practice of writing whiskies in the plural .

		Rime for rhyme makes one shudder .

		Doubtless there are in the list many spellings that , even without
Cohmibia	ORGANIZATION	's sanc - tion , the world would in time have learned to endure , to pity , and finally to embrace ; but the world dislikes to be asked to hasten in such matters .

Leslie Stephen	PERSON	must have formed an interesting collection after their owner had finished using them .

		The purchaser who would need ten or twenty or fifty dollars for a suitable gift at a jewelry store , finds that for two or three or five dollars wisely expended at a book store he can procure a gift always acceptable and in good taste .

		The `` Publisher 's Weekly '' says on this point : `` The strength of the book trade is in the fact that it is midway between the necessaries and the luxuries .

		The richer classes will not buy expensive jewelry , and their Christmas purchases are the more likely to be of books .

		This will be true also of the great middle class , people who find in books a convenient and inexpensive present .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		BROWNING 'S NARRATIVE VERSE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dlvl . -RRB-

		In his survey of English narrative poetry , published in your issue of
November 16	DATE	, Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	repeats a criticism of
Browning	PERSON	that has been heard frequently before -- that the monologue , his most ' characteristic form of art , is thoroughly unnatural .

		One may heartily agree with what Mr.
Moore	PERSON	goes on to say , !

		that a soliloquy may easily be overdone ;
Browning	PERSON	him - j self overdid it , for example in `` The Return of the Druses , '' act ii , scene i , in which
Djabal	ORGANIZATION	leads off with a long soliloquy and follows it up with five '' asides '' before he and KhalU begin to converse together -- to say nothing of the asides in which
Djabal	ORGANIZATION	and Anael indulge later in the scene .

		But with
Browning	PERSON	's master - piece the case is different .

		If Mr.
Moore	PERSON	will take down '' The Ring and the Book '' once more , he will find , I think , that it contains just three solUoquies -- the remarks of the two lawyers and of the Pope .

		In the first and the last poem
Browning	PERSON	speaks in his capacity of editor and interpreter ; all the other speakers address one or more persons and can not therefore be said to soliloquize .

		With regard to the artistic merits of mon - ologues of this kind , I do not see how speaking that is intended to be heard is less artistic than writing that is intended to be read .

		And to say that one must not speak beyond a certain length of time is a good deal like saying that a sunset may be crimson to a certain degree , but not more so ; it is to utter the most baneful kind of criticism that literature has to encounter .

		But how about the soliloquies of the lawyers , the Pope , and , for that matter , of any and all of
Browning	PERSON	's poems ?

		Here again Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is right if one accepts his premises .

		A soliloquy talk no compdling came is doubtless unnatural ; though it were rash , perhaps , to say the most foolish of all the many follies of literature .

		But does
Browning	PERSON	lack the compelling cause ?

		De Archangelis is writing his speech in defense of
Guido	LOCATION	.

		Surely there can be no artistic sin in projecting his thoughts upon paper -- even to the extent of aU the thoughts that come to him until the speech is pigeon - holed and he goes off to play with
Cinoncello	PERSON	.

		Similarly , Bottinius reads his finished speech , with brief com - ments ; what can be more natural or lifelike ?

		The Pope speaks 212S lines , it is tme , -- a little more than the number in `` Macbeth '' ; but surely there is a com - pelling cause for his prolonged deliberation , -- it is not merely Guide 's life , worthless as that appears , not merely his own eternal welfare , it is the triumph of justice over injustice , of righteousness over the subtle forces of hell .

		As the arbiter of this strife , the Pope may well pause .

		That his utterance should be a soliloquy , is in the nature of things inevitable ; a powerful situation could hardly be devised that would provide him with an interlocutor .

		I am not pleading with Mr.
Moore	PERSON	for the inclusion of any part of '' The Ring and the Book '' in his proposed anthology -- which may we have soon ; but he might do worse than print therein '' Caponsacchi '' and '' Pompilia , '' the stories of two of the most impressive cliaracters of the world 's fiction .

		If we are to have an anthology of English narrative verse , might it not be better to include in it `` Ten - nyson 's '' The Passing of Arthur '' ' in preference to the poet 's cruder earlier form ''
Morte D'Arthur	PERSON	, '' as recom - mended by Mr.
Charles L. Moore	PERSON	in your current issue ?

		The rules that govern the making of an anthology must of necessity be based on personal preferences .

		But the selection of an experiment in preference to a completed form seems to me so peculiar that for a mo - ment one is tempted to think it possible that the writer confused the '' Morte D'Arthur '' with '' The Passing of
Arthur	PERSON	. ''

		QuEEK
Victoria	LOCATION	as Letter - Writer .

		* The long-awaited
Letters of Queen Victoria	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	and
Viscount Esher	PERSON	, have at last appeared in three generous octavos , not far from two thousand pages ; and yet the correspondence extends only to the beginning of the year
1862	DATE	, and is , so the editors intimate , a mere sifting of the whole mass of available material .

		If a sieve with even finer meshes had been used , and a good third or half of the actu - ally published letters kept back , we should still have been served with no scant measure .

		In - deed , for purposes of honest reading -LRB- not skim - ming -RRB- and hearty enjoyment , it is not impossi - ble that if these letters had been , like the Sibylline Books , diminished by two-thirds , the remaining third would , like them , have been worth as much as the whole .

		Communications of a merely formal nature , and those that , like many to the writer 's '' dearly beloved Uncle '' -LRB- King Leopold of
Belgium	LOCATION	-RRB- , contain nothing but pretty out-gushings of affection , are so little varied or original in conception and expression , that a very few might fairly answer as repre - sentative of all .

		There are enough that are important , as illustrative either of current his - tory or of personal character , without including those of lesser interest .

		For the letters , merely as examples of epistolary literature , are in no way remarkable ; their writer was far from being a
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	.

		The monotony is pleasantly relieved by the insertion of many letters to the Queen , by extracts from other contemporary documents , and by an occasional passage from her majesty 's diary .

		Moreover , the care and skill shown in editing and annotating this great quantity of miscel - laneous matter are all that could be desired .

		Besides the editors , several other men of letters , expert in various departments of learning and literature , have taken part in the preparation of these volumes .

		Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	'' has read and criticised the book in its final form '' ; Lord KnoUys has aided in the selection of material ; Mr.

		and others have rendered service of different kinds .

		A word , now , from the editors as to the general plan of the whole work .

		`` His Majesty , the King , having decided that no attempt should he made to puhlish these papers in extenso , it was necessary to determine upon some definite prin - ciple of selection .

		It became clear that the only satis - factory plan was to publish specimens of such docu - ments as would serve to bring out the development of the Queen 's character and disposition , and to give typical instances of her methods in deallug with political and social matters -- to produce , in fact , a book for British citizens and British subjects , rather than a book for students of political history .

		That the inner workings of the imwritten constitution of the country , that some of the unrealized checks and balances , that the delicate equipoise of the component parts of our executive macliinery , should stand revealed , was inevitable . ''

		It was thought the less desirable to make the work a detailed history of the years 1837-61 '' as Sir
Theodore Martin	PERSON	, under the auspices of the Queen herself , has dealt so minutely and exhaustively with the relations of the
Queen	ORGANIZATION	's innermost circle to the political and social life of the time . ''

		A few extracts , to exhibit if possible in so brief a space the Queen 's character in process of development , and to give an idea of '' her methods in dealing with jjolitical and social matters , '' may now be fitly introduced .

		The letters really begin nine years before the assigned date , the earliest one having been written in
1828	DATE	.

		It is the first of a long series to Prince , and afterward
King	PERSON	,
Leopold	PERSON	, brother to the Duchess of Kent .

		As girlishly human as that of any little nine-year-old Miss to a fond uncle , it offers the strongest possible contrast to the great mass of later letters , so many of which are formal and official and written by a secre - tary 's hand . ''

		My dearest Uncle , -- I wish you many happy returns of your birthday ; I very often think of you , and I hope to see you soon again , for I am very fond of you .

		I see my Aunt Sopliia often , who looks very well , and is very well .

		I use every day your pretty soup-basin .

		Is it very warm in

		P. S. -- I am very angry with you .

		Uncle , for you have never written to me once since you went , and that is a long while . ''

		Another letter ,
six years later	DATE	, to the same beloved uncle , shows the writer deep in history , ancient and modem .

		It was certainly no ordin - ary mind that coidd , at her age , understand and enjoy the works in which she declares herself so deeply interested .

		Shorn of introductory and concluding amenities , the letter reads as follows : '' As I have not got Sully 's Memoirs , I shall be delighted if you will be so good as to give them to me .

France	LOCATION	, from the year 180S till
1814	DATE	.

		I have also begun Rollin .

		I am very fmd of malring tables of the Kings and
Queens	LOCATION	, as I go on , and I have lately finished one of the English Sovereigns and their consorts , as , of course , the history of my own country is one of my first duties . ''

		The courting and the espousal of the young Queen receive due mention in the correspondence of early
1840	DATE	, but the editors have permitted no desecration of the innermost sanctuary of the heart .

		In a letter written on the day following her marriage , the happy bride exclaims , with lavish use of italics and capitals , and splendid disregard of grammar and syntax : ' • I write to you from here -LSB-
Windsor Castle	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- , the happiest , happiest Being that ever existed .

		Really , I do not think it possible for anyone in the world to be happier , or as happy as I am .

		^ NTiat I can do to make him happy will be my greatest delight . ''

		Passing now to the revolutionary disturbances of

Melbourne	LOCATION	on the l-Sth of ilarch . ''

		Lord
Melbourne	LOCATION	will agree with the Queen that the last three weeks have brought back the times of the
last century	DATE	, and we are in the midst of troubles abroad .

		The Revolution in
France	LOCATION	is a sad and alarming thing .

		... The poor
King	PERSON	and his Government made many mistakes within the
last two years	DATE	, and were obstinate and totally blind at the last till flight was inevitable .

		But for six : een years he did a great deal to maintyin peace , and made
France	LOCATION	prosperous , which shonld not be forgotten ... Lord
Melbourne	LOCATION	's kind heart will grieve to think of the real want the poor King and Queen are in , their diimer-table containing barely enough to eat ... Surely the poor old King is sufficiently puni ^ ed for his faults . ''

		Reference is also made to the discontent in Ger - many , but the writer feels assured that `` the good Germans are at bottom very loyal . ''

		She also gives thanks that
Belgium	LOCATION	is not involved in the prevailing disturbances .

		Among the many statesmanlike letters and messages of the Queen , a eommimication to
Lord Clarendon	LOCATION	, Foreign Secretary , written on the eve of the outbreak of the Crimean War , will serve as an illustration of her clear-headedness and sagacity .

		We quote a few sentences , but can not feel sure how far they are the unprompted expression of her own mind . ''

		As matters have now been arranged , it spears to the Queen , moreover , that we have taken on ourselves in conjunction with
France	LOCATION	all the risks of a European war without having bound
Turkey	LOCATION	to any conditions with respect to provoking it .

		The hundred and twenty fanatieal Turks constituting the Divan at
Constantinople	LOCATION	are left sole judges of the line of policy to be pursued , and made cognisant at the same time of the fact that
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	have bound themselves to defend the Turkish Territory !

		This is entrusting them with a power which
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	has been jealous to confide even to the hands of the British Crown .

		It may be a question whether
Elngland	LOCATION	ought to go to war for the defense of so-called Turkish Independence ; but there can be none that if she does so , she ought to be the sole judge of what constitutes a breach of that independence , and have the fullest power to prevent by negotiation the breaking ont of the war . ''

		A visit of the
Emperor Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		to
England	LOCATION	, in
1856	DATE	, moved his royal hostess to certain reflections on the strangely contradictory qualities of his character .

		From a five-page '' memorandum * ' in which the Queen attempts to analyze that character , a few words may be quoted .

		The paper begins with comments on the remarkable combination of circimistances that had brought
England	LOCATION	and her ancient foe and rival ,
France	LOCATION	, into close alliance , and had made it possible for the nephew of the hated Corsican to set foot on British soil as a friendly visiting monarch .

		The writer 's sex would not be hard to guess , did we not already know it .

		`` That he t , < a very extraordinary man , with great qualities , there can be no doubt -- I might almost say a mysterious man .

		He is evidently possessed of indomit - abk courage , mtfiatdung jbrmmea '' f pnarpote , ndf-rdiaitee , peneeenatee , and great teorecy ; to this should be added , a great rdiance oa what he calls his Star , and a belief in omens and incidents as eonnected with his future destiny , which is almost romantic -- and at the same time he is endowed with wonderful tdf-contrai , great calmness , even gendenesf , and with '' power otfiuematioH , the effect of which upon all those iriw beeome more intimately acquainted with him is wnml senri & fy felt . ''

		And so on , with a use of italics that seems almost frantic .

		She thinks him more German than French in disposition , astonishingly tactful and versed in public affairs for one reared in com - parative obscurity , and in one sense irresponsible for his acts of cruelty and wrong , because he be - lieves himself the passive instrument of a heaven - appointed destiny .

		The whole document forms one of the most curious items in the whole book .

		The two qiudities most typical of English middle-class character , as the editors point out , are common-sense and fomily affection ; and these qualities the Queen possessed in generous 370 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Hence her popularity , and herein the appeal which her letters make to the general reader .

		Of the handsome appearance of these three ample volumes , and of their many excel - lent and appropriate illustrations , and also of the f uU index and the carefully prepared genea - logical tables , there is no room to speak .

		It is little wonder the work was long in making its appearance .

		Notable Achievements in Wood-Engraving .

		* The distinguished achievement of Mr.
Tim	PERSON	- othy
Cole	PERSON	as a wood-engraver has been more than once noticed in these columns .

		Continuing the monumental series of reproductions of paint - ings by the old masters , begun many years ago with '' Old Italian Masters , '' and followed at considerable intervals by '' Old Dutch and
Flem	PERSON	- ish Masters '' and '' Old English Masters , '' he now presents us with a volume on '' Old Span - ish Masters . ''

		The thirty-one examples of his work contained in it add fresh lustre to his fame .

		Though not all of equal excellence , they are as beautiful artistically as anything he has previ - ously done , and some of them are quite unsur - passed .

		Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's skill with the graver shows no sign of diminution .

		His line is stiU as mar - vellously varied , as virile and sympathetically expressive , as ever .

		There is , too , the same cer - tainty of handling and feeling for tactile values -- to quote Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's phrase , -- the same combination of strength and refinement , that have marked his finest performance in the past .

		Wood-cuts have been so almost entirely su - perseded by photo-mechanical engravings that it seems worth while to set forth here the points wherein each is superior to the other .

		The greater fidelity of the mechanical process is in - contestable , and in spite of more or less inevitable distortion of tone values and the general deaden - ing of the whole effect , the result yields a far better basis for forming an opinion of the orig - inal than any hand-wrought engraving can give .

		If , however , a wood-engraving leaves something out of the reproduction , it affords a much richer quality of tone and preserves more of the atmo - sphere -- the enveloppe , as the French woidd say .

		To put it in another way , the mechanical reproduction is soulless even when authentic , while the wood-cut m ay retain the vitality of the * Old Spanish Masters .

		original though something is perforce left out .

		A comparison of Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's engraving of '' The Spinners '' by
Velasquez	PERSON	with a goo < l photo - engraving of the picture will show clearly what is meant by the foregoing .

		In almost any of the surfaces , -- as , for instance , that of the gown of the woman lifting the curtain , or that of the wall at the right of the alcove , -- it will be found that the engraver has not fuUy brought out all of the subtle modulations and broken color of the painting .

		The wood-cut does , however , give a sense of the way in which brilliant rays of light and pulsing shadows play through the room , and there is a mellowness and softness of tone that the mechanical engraving can not ap - proach .

		Within the limitations imposed by the nature of his art , Mr.
Cole	PERSON	has wrought wonders ; but to appreciate his engravings at their fuU value they should be considered not as reproductions , but as interpretations in another medium .

		Viewed in this way , we may best enjoy their very great beauty in and for itself , and may get from them something we must almost certainly miss if we endeavor to translate them back into the medium from which they were copied .

		Take , for example , the superb engraving of '' The Menippus '' by
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		Wherever the eye may play over it , its texture is entrancing .

		Whether or not it is faithful to the smallest de - tail is unimportant .

		Faithful it is , in a large sense ; but apart from that , it is a work of art in itseK , and the fact that it is based upon another work of art is , or should be , a minor considera ^ tion .

		Similar delight is afforded by each of the en - gravings in this volume , though not always in the same degree .

		Those from the portrait of El Greco by himself , and the '' Head of a Young Man '' by
Velasquez	PERSON	, are veritable triumphs ; and a number of others -- as
Murillo	PERSON	's '' Im - macidate Conception '' and his '' St.
John	PERSON	the Baptist , ''
Morales	PERSON	's ''
Madonna	PERSON	and Child , '' and El
Greco	PERSON	's '' Coronation of the Virgin '' -- are only a little less noteworthy .

		In some instances Mr.
Cole	PERSON	has not been quite so happy in his rendering , as in the `` Portrait of King Philip IV .

		as a Sportsman '' by
Velasquez	PERSON	, where the treatment of the tree leaves something to be de - sired ; in the `` Madonna of the Little Bird '' by
Morales	PERSON	, where the motion in the lines used for the drapery in the background is not quite pleas - ant ; and in '' The Adoration of the Shepherds '' by
Murillo	PERSON	, where again the lines used in en - graving the figure of the shepherd in the fore - ground may be thought a bit too insistent .

		But
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 faultfinding is ever an ungrateful task ; these comparisons should be understood as being made with Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's work at its best , and at his best he is a master without a rival .

		Without having knowledge of all the cir - cumstances that governed jVIi ' .


Cole	PERSON	in making his choice of the paintings reproduced , criticism of the selection would be imfair .

		Were they to be estimated solely for the artistic value of the originals , it woidd be difficult to justify the inclusion of as many works b -RCB- * Murillo as by
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		In the accompanj-ing text Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	champions the cause of Murillo and finds comparison between him and Valasquez '' unjust and profitless . ''

		It is the ' • intrinsic human - ness '' of the works of the Se \ - illian painter that appeals to him more especially .

		Their trivial - ity and lack of intellectual force do not seem to count with him , which is the more surprising as what he has to say about Vela.squez is very gootl indeed , and as he is careful to point out ' that his paintings , in spite of their natiiralism , owe much of their distinction to ' • the decorative quality of the compositions . ''

		As this quality -- the harmonic arrangement of line , mass , and tones -- is fundamental , it furnishes a criterion for all works of art ; yet of its application to these by
MurUlo	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	has naught to say .

		In the main , however , his text is excellent , and should not be overlooked by those who buy the book for the sake of the engra \ 4ngs .

		chances , of moving accidents by flood and field '' ; and the slippered philosopher , too , delights in such tales '' of hair-breadth ` scapes i ' the im - minent deadly breach . ''

		The very sound of such enchanted words as '' The Gold Coast , '' '' The Spanish Alain , '' '' The Frozen North , '' ''
Darkest Africa	PERSON	, '' and '' The Southern Cross '' stir the imagination .

		The spirit of the wanderlust is an abiding one , though the world grows smaller and the volume of books describing it grows ever larger .

		No recent book on
Africa	LOCATION	more strikingly confirms Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	's saying , '' Bx
Africa	LOCATION	aliquid semper novi '' than the books of
Herr C. G. Schillings	PERSON	, the German animal photographer and naturalist .

		Out of
Africa Herr Schillings	ORGANIZATION	has brought the most wonderfid and most intimate pictures of wild animals we have ever seen . ''

		In
Wildest Africa	LOCATION	, '' the naturalist-photographer 's latest work , is a stout volume of over seven hundred pages , with over three hundred photographic studies direct from the author 's negatives .

		It brings the lives of African birds and beasts before us with almost startling accuracy .

		At first view , these pictures are likely to be disappointing ; they lack that sharpness and distinctness of outline which we associate with ordinarj ' photography .

		But as one grows familiar with them they take on a new aspect , that of impressionistic art .

		On this particular point ,
Herr Schillings	PERSON	says : `` Considering the extreme difficulty of taking por - traits of living animals in their wild , timid state , such pictures can only in a few instances lay claim to tech - nical perfeeticm .

		But so far as my taste goes , a certain lack of sharp definition in the picture ... is not only no disadvantage , but is even desirable . ''

		The author writes further on this subject : '' It must be noted tliat if the animals are drawn so as to stand out separated from the landscape which is a needful accessory of the picture , and brought forward into the foregroimd in an obviously selected pose , they must appear umiatural to the eye of the expert .

		Such pictures can not fail to give an unnatural impression , for in the freedom of the wilderness the animal would never present itself in this way to the eyes of man .

		... It has been a keen satisfaction to me to find that many world-renowned artists have appreciated warmly the beauty of these photographs , and have given expression to this feeling .

		I have been told , for instance , -- what I myself had already noticed , - -- that many of the pic - tures , especially those showing birds on the wing , bear a great resemblance to certain famous works of Japanese painters of animal life , works that seem to dive into the secrets of nature . ''

		Bearing these words in mind , we can ^ new a photogi-aph of a herd of antelopes , a troop of gazelles , giraffes , or zebras , or it may be a flock of cranes or storks , and understand how they and 372 THE DIAL ^
Dec. 1	DATE	, their environment are one ; their bodies and their very actions sha < ling into the hazy atmosphere of their native wilds , or melting away into in - definite outlines in the shimmering light of the African veldt or jungle .

		As a matter of fact , there is a wide divergence between title and text in this volume : the larger part of the text deals with matter entirely foreign to the title .

		After an introductory chapter treating the changes in
Africa	LOCATION	dui'ing the past decade , the author writes on such diverse topics as the development of ani - mal portraiture , the disappearance of African wUd game , and then -- of all topics !

		-- '' Sport and Nature in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		This foreign matter is followed by chapters relating to the real sub - ject of the volume , the most interesting one be - ing `` The Capturing of a Lion '' ; and the book closes with two more chapters on photography and its possibilities as helps to the study of wild-life .

		Mr.
F. A. McKenzie	PERSON	, an Englishman , in his volume entitled '' The Unveiled East , '' depicts
Japan	LOCATION	as a menace to the trade and prestige of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in that region .

		The opening words of the book tell the reader what the uplifted veil reveals . ''

		By the extension and maintenance of territorial supremacy outside her own borders , by securing exclu - sive trading privileges , by a wholesale system of mono - polies , subsidies , bounties , and concessions , and by the skilful use of her limited tariff autonomy ,
Japan	LOCATION	has entered fully upon a campaign of aggressive imperial - ism ... Entering
Korea	LOCATION	under the guise of friend - ship and alliance , her representatives have absorbed the govermnent , made the Emperor virtually a pris - oner , forced the British chief of the
Custom Service	ORGANIZATION	from office , acquired many concessions , and seized the lands and homes of the common people in town and country . ''

		Manchuria too , the author asserts , will soon be under the rule of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, and the integrity of
China	LOCATION	is threatened with the grasping hand of the wUy Japanese .

		National pride and economic necessity are driving the Japanese onward , and it is time , so Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	thinks , to treat them , '' not as children , not as serai - angels , but as a great , ambitious , and strong - purposed nation . ''

		Such is the drift of Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	's book ; but we do not wish to con - vey the idea through our quotations that the author is a
Jeremiah	PERSON	.

		Quite to the contrary , his book is well-balanced and reserved in opinion and in fact , and makes interesting and profita - ble reading for anyone concerned in Far Eastern affairs .

		Besides his thorough discussion of commercial and diplomatic affairs in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, the author has entertaining chapters on the new Chinese army , the '' new woman '' in
China	LOCATION	, and the great missionary question .

		On the last topic , Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	says : `` The day of the foreign missionary of the old type in
Japan	LOCATION	is over .

		The missionary work there to-morrow will rather be done by the occasional visits of expert foreign evangelists and by the literary and intellectual efforts of a few highly trained teachers , than along present lines . ''

		England 's opportunity in the vital issues soon to be sifted in the
Far East	LOCATION	lies in her being the friend and protector of
China	LOCATION	; and , concludes the author , `` English and American interests in the Far East are identical . ''

		No book on our present list is more worthy of extended consideration that the one bearing the title '' The Near East . ''

		Although the volume is published anonymously , every page reveals the author as one who investigates his subject thoroughly , discriminates his information care - fully , and writes convincingly .

		Moreover he apparently had easy access to the powers that ` rule in
Montenegro	LOCATION	,
Bosnia	LOCATION	,
Servia	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Roumania	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		He sipped coffee , smoked cigarettes , and talked with the '' various kings and princes of the Balkan states , '' the Sidtan of
Turkey	LOCATION	, and nearly all the members of the various cabinets , as well as with people of the middle class and with peasants , in order to form some conclusion as to the real situa - tion -- political , economical , social , and finan - cial -- in this European hotbed of discord .

		He found
Montenegro	LOCATION	the most interesting country in all the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		Prince
Nicholas	PERSON	, its i-ider , told the author that the solution of the Balkan difficulty lies in placing
Macedonia	LOCATION	under a governor-general who must be a European prince .

		Against the advice of his
London	LOCATION	friends and contrary to the strong opposition of Prince
Nicholas	PERSON	, and , moreover , in spite of the fact that the insurance companies declined to accept the risk of accident , the author went to the
Accursed Mountains	LOCATION	in
Northern Albania	LOCATION	-- a country hitherto practically a sealed book , for there are no printed accounts of actual travel there , nothing even in the journals of the
Koyal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Accursed Mountains are inhabited by brigandish tribes -- the '' real thing '' out of the story-book -- who hold life cheap .

		They come down from the mountains in armed bands , and walk through the town , a dozen or so together , in complete defiance of the Turks .

		After much trouble , the author enjoyed the unique pleasure of being the guest of
Vatt Marashi	PERSON	, chief of the
Skeli	PERSON	, the strongest and most feared of the mountain bands .

		This story-book brigand spoke significantly of the revolt of the Albanians from the Turk .

		878 '' The revolt will come one day ere long -- when we are ready .

		We can , however , afford to wait at pres - ent .

		Turkey will soon have her hands full with Bul - garia and
Macedonia	LOCATION	, and then -- well , we shall help
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and in a week there wo n't be a Turk in
Skodra	LOCATION	. ''

		In
Bosnia	LOCATION	, the writer found the clever , subtle , evil hand of
Austria	LOCATION	working in Machiavellian style -- one of extermination and extension .

		When writing on the subject of
Austria	LOCATION	and Ger - many in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, the writer is so intensely in earnest that the reader holds his breath at the audacious charges made against those na - tions .

		But his very earnestness is proof of his own assertion that his purpose is not '' to scream hysterical condemnations . ''

		One of the most astonishing features in this rather remarkable book is the author 's commendation of
King Peter of Servia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The world has come to think , rightly or wrongly , that
King Peter	PERSON	is sadly out of place as a ruler in this highly sensitizetl region .

		In all circles of society , the author tells us , the
King	ORGANIZATION	is recognized as a model father , as a wise ruler who leaves j > olitics to his ministers , and as a man who concerns himseK with the more humble duties of advancing the cause of sanitation , agriculture , and religion .

		Surely a new picture of King
Peter	PERSON	I In regard to the ever-present quarrel between the
Bidgar	PERSON	and the Turk , the author is clear that ''
Bulgaria	LOCATION	has right on her side , and in the name of humanity it is the duty of the Powers to support her . ''

		The Turks , at least those in high place , regard their govern - ment of
Macedonia	LOCATION	with complacent equanimity , denjnng that they aid and abet the Greek bands in massacring the Christians , and viewing the possibilities of war with Bidgaria with perfect tranquillity .

		This tranquillity and equanimity , asserts our author , doubtless arise from the re - liance of
Turkey	LOCATION	on
Germany	LOCATION	.

		All Turks are fascinated by the benign smile of
Germany	LOCATION	; they are mystified as to what
Austria	LOCATION	will do in event of war , and they are given to treating
Great Britain	LOCATION	with studied politeness .

		In conclusion , the author predicts war in that country within a few months .

		An excellent map , manj ' choice illustrations made from photographs by the au - thor and by
Princess Xenia	LOCATION	of
Montenegro	LOCATION	, and a gootl table of contents , make the volume a pleasing one .

		Mr.
F. G. Aflalo	PERSON	, an Englishman , came to our country on two ambitious quests : first , to meet the President , and , secondly , to catch tar - pon on the
Florida	LOCATION	coast .

		Both ambitions were happily attained .

		Such hospitality and such good luck should have inclined the author to a more considerate valuation of the land which gave him such good entertainment .

		But not - withstanding his plea of candor , Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	, in his volume entitled '' Sunshine and Sport in
Florida	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	, '' amuses himself by giving some hard raps to us and our institu - tions .

		In the first part of his book , '' The Way There '' -LRB- meaning his trip to
New York	LOCATION	, to
Washington	LOCATION	, and the South -RRB- , the author takes a shy at our cigars , children , coffee , food , tea , men and women , and our idea of liberty . ''

		I venture to suggest that there is in one hour in
London	LOCATION	more personal liberty than in a year of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		This last statement , we gather , arises from an incident in a
New York	LOCATION	street - car in which a large and overheated bricklayer sat on the author 's knees without as much as '' by your leave . ''

		The South , in Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	's opinion , is to be pitied for the paralyzing influ - ence of the negro question .

		The author s view of the race problem is revealed thus : '' I wish that some of the poor negro 's advocates could know the sensation of being hustled off a side - walk by a buck nigger in the full flush of emancipation . '

		There are , to be sure , many words of praise for us and our institutions , -- the zoological collection and the aquarium in
New York	LOCATION	, the beauty of
Washington	LOCATION	, and the scenery of
North Carolina	LOCATION	around
Asheville	LOCATION	; but on the whole , the view is warped and per - verted .

		Had Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	gathered his impressions at greater leisure , and generalized less from trivial instances , he woidd have informed his volume with the more genial spirit which we associate with the men who go a-fishing .

		For we can find no fault with Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	's story of his tarpon fishing .

		He writes on that subject with such zest and good-humor that we too can fish with him from our arm-chair .

		All that j pertains to tarpon catching , from the cost of the tackle to landing the game , is interestingly recounted in the book .

		In eleven days the author caught seventeen tarpon , most of them on the
afternoon of the last day	TIME	.

		As a matter of mere sport , however .

		Mi * .

		Aflalo does not rank tarpon fishing very high .

		If one 's tackle holds , one is likely to land one 's catch -- imless , as often occurs , a shark takes a hand in the sport , a tip breaks , or the fish is foid-hooked .

		With less jx -RRB- werfid tackle , so the author con - tends , the sport would be increased , as more skill would be required .

		But sometimes , as happened to the \ vriter of this book , the heavy tackle which makes tarpon fishing a cometly makes a ti-agedy in the play of fishing , as when a shark takes the bait .

		Mr.
Aflalo	PERSON	suffered the unpleasant sensation of being towed for over 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, two hours in his boat by a shark which had taken the bait , -- a grim performance which made ordinary fishing seem commonplace .

		Mr.
Alexander Macdonald	PERSON	, the author of '' In Search of El Dorado , '' is one of those venture - some spirits of our day whose exploits challenge comparison with the deeds of soldiers of fortune of earlier times .

		He has wandered over much of the world in search of gold , opals , and pearls , and his book recomits his adventures in such remotely related lands as the Ivlondike , the back-blocks and the Never-Never Land of Aus - tralia , and British
New Guinea	LOCATION	.

		Nature , how - ever , has made the balance so even over the globe , that the seeker for her treasures finds sufficient occupation and diversion .

		The gold - seeker is ever rewarded with a host of tales , if not with a phethoi-a of wealth ; and of the tales , Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	has garnered his share .

		At times his adventures are a little too marvellous , the coincidences a bit too striking , and the luck or ill-luck slightly too much colored ; but we can appreciate the stories , for they are capitally told .

		The reader who remembers his boyhood stories of the gold-hunters in
Australia	LOCATION	wiU enjoy this breezy book .

		REMrNISCENCES OF AX ENGLISH AllTIST .

		* Although not the foremost of living British artists , Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	enjoys the distinction of being the most widely known .

		Wherever the English language is spoken , his name for more than a quarter of a century has been as a household word among those to whom art is something more than a mere abstraction .

		Nor is his fame confined to his own countrymen and theu - cousins in the colonies and in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is even greater on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	than at home ; and in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, in particular , he is the idol of a considerable nimiber of the more progressive spirits who regard placid acceptance of traditional views as stifling , and hail Mr.
Crane	PERSON	as the leatler under whose guidance the arts of design shall be revivified .

		The reason for this lies not so much in the quality of the work from Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's hand , as in the fact that almost from the beginning of his career he has been a pioneer .

		To some extent also it is attributable to his fertility of ideas , and to a fondness for allegory which captivates those who value art less for its aesthetic message than • An Artist 's Eeminiscences .

W. J. Linton	PERSON	, to learn the craft of drawing on the wood , in that day a necessary accomplishment for those who intended devoting themselves to book illustrating .

		In
1863	DATE	, an introduction to Mr.
Edmund Evans	PERSON	-- whose name deserves wide renown for notable achieve - ment in the development of color-printing -- led to the designing of the children 's picture-books with which , so long as he continues to be known , the name of
Walter Crane	PERSON	will be associated .

		He was but twenty when the first of these l > ooks appeared .

		Like many so-called children 's books , their refinements m design and coloring were bcjyond the appreciation of the very young ; and , to quote Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's words , they were issued '' not without protest from the publishers , who thought the raw coarse colors and vulgar designs usually curre ^ jt appealed to a larger public , and therefore paid better . ''

		The distinctive quality of the Illustrations for these books was due in large measure to the influence of some Japanese color-prints that were presented to the artist by a lieutenant in the navy , who had recently visited
Japan	LOCATION	.

		From the first they found favor in the eyes of people of taste , and soon achieved wide popularity .

		Unfortimately , the cost of production made an edition of at least fifty thousand copies neces - sary to yield a profit to the publishers , and their unwillingness to allow Mr.
Crane	PERSON	a royalty above the price paid him for his designs caused him to '' strike , '' and so about
1875	DATE	the series came to an end .

		In
1876	DATE	'' The Baby 's Opera '' was brought out mider different auspices ; and this , meeting with marked success , was followed by '' The Babys Bouquet , '' '' Baby 's Own aEsop , ' and , in the course of years , by many other picture-books to delight grown-up chil - dren if not wee ones .

		Though considered by Mr.
Crane	PERSON	as of less importance than the more ambitious works sent by him to the
London	LOCATION	ex - hibitions , it is nevertheless upon his designs for book illustration , for paper hangings , and other decorative purposes , that his reputation chiefly rests .

		It was in these that he marked out a new path , and inspired others quite as much by what he suggested as by what he accomplished .

		Their teaching was reinforced by a book on '' The Claims of Decorative Art , '' and by numer - ous lectures afterward published in book form .

		THE DIAL 375 Together with
George Clausen	PERSON	.


W. Holman Hunt	PERSON	, and others , ilr .


Crane	PERSON	did much to give impetus to a movement begun in
1886	DATE	as a pro- test against the arrogant attitude of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	, which , as
Holman	PERSON	Hunt phrased it in a letter to '' The Times , '' ' constituted • ' a per - petual injury to art '' by helping ' • to dazzle the feeble judgments of the world as to what is true merit . ''

		The idea of an exhibition open to all artists , each of whom should be eligible upon committees and should have a voice in their selection , appealed strongly to Mr.
Crane	PERSON	, who about this time had become an ardent socialist of the type representetl by
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Through the timidity of many of its supporters , the original idea fell through : but it bore fruit a little later in the formation of the Arts and
Crafts Exhibition Society	ORGANIZATION	, of which 3 > Ir .

		Crane was the first president .

		To the extensive adv ^ - tising this movement received , his popularity on the continent may in large measure be ascribed , though it would be unfair to hold him responsi - ble for the eccentricities perpetrated by some of his disciples imder the guise of '' Secessionism '' and '' L'Art Nouveau . ''

		In the course of an active life and extensive travel .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	has been brought into con - tact , and frequently into intimate relations , with many of the distinguished men of his day .

		It might well be expected , therefore , that in '' An Artist 's Reminiscences '' ' he would give a new exemplification of the sajnng that such recol - lections furnish the most fascinating form of literary dissipation .

		Instead , we have a long autobiography , crowded with tri \ Tal detail , in - teresting , no doubt , to the circle of those imme - diately concerned , but not esjjecially enlivening to the world at large .

		\ \ ` here detail would be of interest it is often lacking .

		The catalogue of eminent people whom he mentions is little more than a list of names , casually introduced , -- as in the following example : '' We continued to extend our a ^ uaintanceship in
Rome	LOCATION	, chiefly in the English and American colony .

		At the hotel
Molaro	PERSON	, nearly opposite to us , lived Mr.
Healy	PERSON	and his family .

		He was an American portrait painter of considerable repute in his own country .

		They used to give evening conversazioni : and I remember on Mie occasion , in the
spring of 1872	DATE	, General
Sherman	PERSON	, who had been Commander-in-Chief of the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	forces in the American Civil War , was the principal lion , -- a tall , thin , keen , but kindly-looking American . ''

		To such brevities of description there are .

		naturally many exceptions , and there are occa - sional word-pictures for which we should be grateful .

		One of these -- it is too long to be here given in full -- tells of his early master , Mr.
LLuton	PERSON	. ''


W. J. Linton	PERSON	was in appearance small of stature , but a very remarkable-looking man .

		His fair hair , rather fine and thin , fell in actual locks to his shoulders , and he wore a long flowing beard and mustache , then beginning to be tinged with grey .

		A keen , impulsive - looking , highly sensitive face , with kindly blue eyes , looked out under the unusually broad brim of a black ' wide awake . '

		He wore turn-down c < d -RSB- ars when the rest of the world mostly turned them up -- a loose con - tinental-looking necktie , black velvet waistcoat , and a long-waisted coat of a very peculiar cut , having no traditional two buttons at the junction of the skirts at the back , trousers of an antique pattern belonging to the ' forties , ' rather tight at the knees and falling over
Wellington	LOCATION	boots with small slits at the sides .

		He had abundance of nervous energy , and moved with '' quick , rapid step , coming into the office with a sort of breezy rush , bringing with him always a stimulating sense of vitality .

		He spoke rapidly in a light-ton ^ voice , frequently punctuated with a curious dry , obstructed sort of laugh . ''

		Amusinff anecdote is not abundant in the book , and it is a pity to be obliged to state that as a literary production it is marred by rather frequent slipshod writing .

		In this there is some - times entertainment , as when we read : ''
Bateman	PERSON	was the most remarkable draughtsman of flowers among modems I have seen , after the best Japanese work . ''

		But what shall be said about such a sentence as the following ? ''

		This had the effect of malting me very shy of offer - ing any more MS. to editors , though I continued to write , simply as an outlet for one 's thoughts and ideas . ''

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's comments upon both people and events are always kindly , and are singularly free from acrimony .

		If he ever had fallings - out with any of his associates , he has seen fit to keep them to himself .

		In this connection , one incident that he relates is worth repeating for the light it throws upon the view held by Sir Edwaid Bume-Jones regarding the work of another eminent artist . ''

		Mr.
Leyhnd	PERSON	of Prince 's Gate I also met about this time .

		He was a notable patron of art , and very wealthy , but became still more celebrated as the owner of the famous peacock room decorated by Wliistler .

		I recall a dinner in that room he gave to a company of artists , most of them exhibitors at the Grosvenor , I think , as well as some
R.A. 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bume-Jones was there , and Val .

		Prinsep ,
G. H. Boughton	PERSON	,
E. J. Pointer	PERSON	,
T. Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	,
Spencer Stanhope	PERSON	-LRB- I think -RRB- ,
Comvns Carr	PERSON	, and others .

		I sat next to Bxime-Jones , and the conversation happened to turn on
Whistler	LOCATION	's work , and I expressed my appre - ciation of its artistic quality .

		I was rather surprised to find , however , that Bume-Jones could not , or would not , see his merit as an artist , or recognize the differ ^ ence of his aims .

		He seemed to think there was only one right way of painting , and after a little discussicMi , he said , with some emphasis , ' This is the only time we ever had a difference and -- it shall be the last ! '

		I forgot , or did not realize , that the libel case of
Whistler V. Ruskin	PERSON	was about to come on , in which Bume-Jones was an important witness for the defendant , and , in 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, fact , though much against the grain , and only under the strongest pressure from
Ruskiu	LOCATION	, he undertook to appear in court for him .

		Under the circumstances he could hardly aiford to allow any credit to
Whistler	LOCATION	. ''

		Admirers of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's art will find scat - tered through the pages of the volume a very full record of his work in various forms , and reproductions in black-and-white of many of his more important compositions .

		The book will be valued for these , but still more as the life - record of a man of refined and gentle person - ality , who , while keeping well to the fore in the storm and stress of a busy world , has yet been more truly a dweller in '' the magic world of romance and pictured poetry . ''

		Holiday Publications .

		I. Travel and Description .

		The residential
London Square	LOCATION	is essentially an English institution .

		Those groups of private houses , whose inhabitants have a sort of prescriptive right over the iron-fenced park or garden on which their residences abut , have no counterpart in any other quarter of the globe .

		And they are as fascinating as they are unique , -- these pleasant green oases set in the thick of the noisy and murky city .

		It is of these residential Squares , far more numerous than the uninformed reader would believe , that Mr.
E. Beresford	PERSON	Chancellor has written , entitling his study `` The History of the Squares of
London	LOCATION	,
Topo	ORGANIZATION	- graphical and Historical '' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- .

		The stout quarto volume is handsomely bound , and thirty-six photogravure illustrations reproduce quaint old prints , engravings , and drawings , picturing the Squares in by-gone days .

		`` It has been absolutely impossible to be exhaustive in the treatment of the different Squares , '' writes Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	in his pre - face . ''

		What I have attempted to do , is to set down their history , to describe their formation , to trace the occupancy of their houses to interesting , notable , and , in some cases , notorious people , and here and there to enliven a mere dull enumeration of names and dates by some story or anecdote which may seem to be not wholly out of place in a book of this character .

		Had I attempted to do more than this , the result would have been stupendous , for it is a fact that , taken as a whole , the history of the Squares of
London	LOCATION	and their inhabitants , past and present , makes a large inroad on the literary , the artistic , and the political annals of the country . ''

		The most fam - ous Squares are treated separately , the others are discussed in neighborhood groups .

		Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	's account of his style is too modest .

		There is very little indeed in his book that can accurately be called `` dull enumeration , '' and there are plenty of anec - dotes , bits of forgotten history , and curious reminis - cence . ''


London	LOCATION	is nothing to some people , '' Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	quotes Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	as saying , '' but to a man whose pleasure is intellectual ,
London	LOCATION	is the place . ''

		It is to this type of man , who loves the Lon - don squares and streets for their crowding human associations -- with real people and with imaginary people , who , thanks to
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	and the rest , are no less real , -- that Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	's scholarly and yet picturesque record will appeal .

		For such a person it is hard to imagine a more welcome gift than this leisurely guide to the quiet little squares through which he has often rambled , with a pleasure in the scenes that was vague by comparison with the vivid enjoyment that Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	's good company will afford him .

		Quite different in its appeal , but equally infused with the pungent , compelling charm of
London	LOCATION	, is one of
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's holiday publications , '' The Colour of
London	LOCATION	, Historic , Per - sonal , and Local . ''

		The text is written by Mr.
W. J. Loftie	PERSON	, and the illustrations and a quaint essay are furnished by the Japanese artist ,
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, whose career in
London	LOCATION	is the subject of an appre - ciative introduction by Mr.
M. H. Spielmann	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Loftie	PERSON	writes of a few of the myriad aspects of Lon - don , -- its color , in the broadest sense of the word , its boundaries and districts , its fashionable quarters past and present , its curious names , its pleasant parks , its quaint records and its quainter corporation gov - ernment , -- treating them all in a delightfully sug - gestive fashion , with a true feeling for the oddities and ramifications of his subject .

		The artist 's essay is an amusingly naive account of his impressions of
London	LOCATION	and its people , of his artistic experiences there , and particularly of his delight in the
London	LOCATION	fog , wnth its mystically beautifying influence on line and color .

		Like all Japanese artists , Mr.
Markino	PERSON	makes only skeleton sketches on the spot , filling them up later from memory and aiming at essential truth rather than accuracy of detail .

		His studies of Lon - don are neither Japanese nor European , but a blend of the two .

		It seems unlikely that fuU justice has been done their delicate coloring in the printing , but even so they are pretty , quaint , striking , and sugges - tive of new values .

		Some of the best are night-scenes done in sepia .

		The subjects vary from ``
Sunday	DATE	Morning in Petticoat Lane , '' '' The Flower-Sellers , Piccadilly , '' and ''
Sloan Square	ORGANIZATION	on a Wet Day , '' to `` Tourists before St.
Paul	PERSON	's Cathedral , '' '' A
Winter Afternoon	ORGANIZATION	,
Chelsea Embankment	PERSON	, '' and `` The Porch of the Carlton Hotel at Night . ''

		The enterprising young Japanese , that is to say , seems to know all parts of his beloved
London	LOCATION	, and to have observed it with the stranger 's open-mindedness and the artist 's sensitiveness to effect .

		It is seldom , even in these days of unique and beautiful travel books , that anything so thoroughly delightful as Mr.
Edward Penfield	PERSON	's '' Holland Sketches '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is published .

		The illustra - tions , some of which have already appeared in con - nection with the '' Sketches '' in
Scribner	LOCATION	's Magazine , are of course in the poster style , which Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	originated in
America	LOCATION	, and which he has developed , both artistically and mechanically , in a manner quite
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		377 his own .

		Nothing could be better suited to his style than the quaint Dutch peasants in their baggy trousers or voluminous skirts , picturesque caps , and clumsy wooden sabots .

		Queer little by-streets , flapping wind - mills on the banks of quiet canals , fishing smacks with patched brown sails , '' interiors '' hung with
Delft	LOCATION	and old brasses , -- these are the things that Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	paints and writes about .

		Geographi - cally speaking , he does not go far from the beaten path in his wanderings through
Holland	LOCATION	; but he never has a beaten-track experience , even when he travels to
Marken	PERSON	on the regular tourists ' steamer .

		He went from
Rotterdam	LOCATION	to
Friesland	ORGANIZATION	in a '' boeier , '' which is a real Dutch freight-boat , willing to carry stray passengers and advertised to sail '' any time to-day . '' '' '

		Any time to-day ! ' ''

		Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	com - ments . ''

		How delightfully Dutch !

		Everyone has time to talk and smoke , and no one is ever in a hurry .

		For a life of elegant leisure , commend me to
Holland	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus at every point Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	shows himself in sympathy with the situation in which he finds him - self , whether he is spending a lonely '' Christmas at
Caf	ORGANIZATION	^ Spaander , '' poking around the side-streets of
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, or buying a sandwich in * ' The Magenta Village '' of a woman who refuses to understand his Dutch but capitulates to his realistically colored drawing of bread and cheese .

		A book like '' Poets ' Country '' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- , which aims to trace the relations of some English poets with the aspects of '' their ain countrie , '' and to pic - ture these scenes in beautiful colored illustrations , might easily degenei-ate into a purely mechanical performance .

		But with Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	as editor , and joint contributor with Professor
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	, and Messrs.
E. Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	,
W. J. Loftie	PERSON	, and
Michael MacmiUan	PERSON	, and with Mr.
Francis S. Walker	PERSON	supplying fifty oil paintings for colored reproduction , '' Poets ' Country '' can not fail to possess substantial literary and artistic merits .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's preface points out that there are poets and poets ; some who are nomads from birth , loving strange lands better than their own , some , like
Shelley	PERSON	, whose country is the '' Land of Dreams , '' but others , like
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Drayton	PERSON	, or
Tennyson	PERSON	, who found their highest inspiration in the familiar English scenes among which their lives were spent .

		However , the dreamers and the wanderers have not been excluded from this book ; and some of the essays which show how little a poet may know about nature are quite as illumin - ating as those devoted to the poets who were patient and loving students of her many moods .

		The authors and the illustrator have varied their methods to suit a wide range of subjects , and yet each con - tribution is distinctive of its author 's individuality .

		The book is one to delight lovers of poetry and lovers of the English country .

		There are twenty - four essays , discussing as many poets or groups of poets , and varied authorship gives them both variety and authority .

		The illustrations are intrinsically beautiful , and are , besides , excellent examples of the best modern color-printing .

		It is now more than forty years since Mr.
William Dean HoweUs	PERSON	published his '' Venetian Life , '' but the flood of travel-literatvire that has followed in its wake has not thrust it from its assured place in American letters .

		In fitting recognition of this fact
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifilin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued a beau - tiful new edition , for which twenty full-page illustra - tions in color have been furnished by Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	.

		The typography and general plan of the volume were placed in the hands of Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	, designer of the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	editions , and it is needless to say that the result is a book of rare distinction .

		Mr.
HoweUs	PERSON	has done his part by adding to and revising his impressions and by writ - ing a personal introduction , addressed '' to the read - er 's private eye , '' which chronicles the history of his maiden adventure in the field of pure literature , and comments , with delightfid humor , upon the author 's early style and youthful point of view .

		Mr.
Grarrett	PERSON	's illustrations make a worthy and harmonious com - plement to the text , though necessarily limiting themselves to its pictorial interest .

		It is the peculiar charm of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's interpretation of
Venice	LOCATION	that it is not limited to these aspects ; the beauty of the city of lagoons , the humor and the pictm-esque - ness of its social life , and the wealth of its historical associations are combined in his pages to form a signally complete and sympathetic interpretation of a fascinating theme .

		Most of the travel-books mentioned in this article describe regions likely to be familiar to many of their readers , who will enjoy living over their own experi - ences while they share those of the authors .

		But `` The Savage South Seas '' -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- , painted by Mr.
Norman Hardy	PERSON	and described by Mr.
E. Way Elkington	PERSON	, wUl attract by virtue of the novelty of its theme .

		The material of the book is arranged under three headings -- British
New Guinea	LOCATION	, the
Solomon Islands	LOCATION	, and the
New Hebrides	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are sixty colored page-plates , portraying the island scenery and the native tj-pes and manners and cus - toms in a great variety of aspects .

		As is fortunately coming more and more to be the rule nowadays , the text of the book is well worthy of the pains that have been taken to beautify it .

		Mr.
Elkington	PERSON	is not a tourist writing impressions caught snap-shot fashion over a steamer raUing .

		Sixteen years ago he took his first trip to
New Zealand	LOCATION	, where he tried gold and gum digging , cattle-driving , and journalism .

		Since then he has traveUed around the world , and has already published several volumes reminiscent of his South Sea experiences .

		He does not state any of these facts in the text , which is a purely impersonal narrative ; but the authoritative tone and the evidently intimate knowledge of native customs are proof positive of something beyond a cursory observation of life among the islanders . ''

		From
Gretna Green	LOCATION	to Land 's End '' -LRB- CroweU -RRB- is a book that readers who look forward to a trip abroad will enjoy and that returned traveUers wUl thoroughly appreciate .

		Miss
Katherine Lee Bates	PERSON	is its author , and her text is supplemented by excel - 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, lent illustrations made from photogi-aphs especially taken for this book .

		Miss
Bates	PERSON	writes informally of her
summer	DATE	wanderings through the west of
England	LOCATION	.

		History , ballad lore , '' open-air delights , '' and particularly literary associations , are touched upon in informal , intimate fashion , the variety of scenes visited making possible a delightful variety of impressions .

		Miss
Bates	PERSON	does not get far off the beaten tracks , but her experiences are not the casual ones of the hurried
summer	DATE	tourist .

		Her reminis - cences have a leisurely atmosphere ; and she de - scribes several unique sights like the Ambleside and
Grasmere	ORGANIZATION	rush-bearings and some out-of-the-way villages in
Devonshire	LOCATION	and
Cornwall	LOCATION	.

		No doubt all cities are complex , meaning a differ - ent thing and making a different appeal to each observer ; but perhaps none is quite so subtle or so many-sided as
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In `` Nooks and Corners of Old
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB-
M. Georges Cain	PERSON	introduces us to a
Paris	LOCATION	that probably no one else knows as well as he .


M. Cain	PERSON	is curator of the
Carnavalet Museum	ORGANIZATION	, which houses the historic collections of the city of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Of the object of his book he writes : `` Seek - ing only the rare , if not the never-yet-brought-to - light , we would simply give to those who , like us , adore our old City a little of the joy we have each day in ' strolling ' about this incomparable Town .

		Our object is to continue , by means of walks through what remains to us of the dear old
Paris	LOCATION	, the series of documents painted , pencilled , or engraved , which are contained in the
Carnavalet Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		... It is a delightful nook in which still throbs a little of the old soul of the great City ! ''

		There is nothing aloof or academic in
M. Cain	PERSON	's account of the landmarks of the
Paris	LOCATION	of by-gone days ; he takes his readers on four delightful rambles through four divisions of the region that held the germs of the great city of to-day .

		The book is artistically illustrated from photographs , etchings , drawings , and water-colors , some from the Carnavalet and other historic collec - tions , others showing modern views of the old quar - ters .

		This notice would be sadly incomplete should it conclude without some mention of the long and delightful introduction contributed by
M. Victorien Sardou	PERSON	, who gives many entertaining reminiscences of the
Paris	LOCATION	of his childhood and youth . ''

		A
Spring Fortnight	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd ,
Mead	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Josephine Tozier	PERSON	, is a sprightly combina - tion of romantic fiction and traveller 's impressions .


Angela Victoria	PERSON	, its protagonist , is a delightful wanderer , who goes where she pleases , sees what she pleases , and always has a good time .

		In her own charming fashion she visits Le Mans ,
Poitiers	LOCATION	,
Carcassonne	LOCATION	, Aries ,
Tarascon	LOCATION	, and half a dozen other cities of
Southern France	LOCATION	, and many excellent illus - trations from photographs show characteristic views of them .


Angela Victoria	PERSON	had an object in making her journey .

		She had been intending ever since she was sixteen to write a book ; and at thirty-six she had finally gotten as far as to decide that it should be a book of travel .

		But , as usual ,
Angela Victoria	PERSON	did the unexpected -- or at least the unan - nounced .

		Among the many things that pleased her rather uncritical taste were good-looking men .

		She happened upon one at Angers , met him again at
Saumur	LOCATION	, helped him to explore
Poitiers	LOCATION	, -- after having been properly introduced by some friends who appeared opportunely in a motor car , -- definitely abandoned the book at
Carcassonne	LOCATION	, and at Tarascon accepted the man , who promised that she should continue to travel as she pleased and should write ten books about each trip if she wanted to .

		It woidd be hard to imagine a more delightful and appropriate subject for a lavishly illustrated book of travel than the
Riviera	LOCATION	.

		Its possibilities have been utilized to the full by Mr.
William Scott	PERSON	, who is both author and artist of `` The Riviera , '' just published by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		As is perhaps inevitable when the character of the subject is considered , the book is chiefly - notable for its illus - trations .

		These depict both the gaiety and the quaint - ness of the region , its tropically luxuriant vegetation , its crags and castles , and its changeful blue sea .

		Alto - gether they give a complete and artistic picture of the region which some one has called the loveliest garden-spot of the eai ` th .

		The text is filled with information , and it is hard to think of a phase of the subject that it does not touch upon , from accounts of the early inhabitants to descriptions of Riviera tourists and '' chit > chat '' about the characteristic delicacies of the
Riviera	LOCATION	hotels .

		Three chapters , one on the French Riviera and two on the
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	stretches of the Italian coast , give the intending traveller a cursory glance at the many stopping-places from which he may take his choice ; while a general chapter entitled '' The Sunny South '' gives a bird 's - eye view of the whole region and suggests some unexplored corners of it and some unconventional points of view for the consideration of the traveller who wishes to see things with his own eyes .

		``
Mexico	LOCATION	and Her People To-day '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is a book of up-to-date information of a miscellaneous sort about a nation concerning which , thougli she stands at our very doors , most of us know very little .

		As Mr.
Nevin A. Winter	PERSON	, author of the book , puts it , '' Every schoolboy knows of
Loch Katrine	PERSON	and
Loch Lomond	PERSON	in bonnie
Scotland	LOCATION	, and most people are familiar with the location of
Lago di Como	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		And yet I should not be surprised if fair - sized towns could be found in the
United States	LOCATION	where no one could tell whether such a body of water as
Lake Chapala	LOCATION	existed or not .

		As a matter of fact , it is ten times as large as all the lakes of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	combined ; and it embraces islands larger than the entire surface of Loch Lomond . ''

		This is probably a fair example of the popular ignor - ance about Mexican geography , and it undoubtedly extends to the resources of the country and their state of development , if not to the customs and characteristics of the people .

		The author 's preface calls attention to the fact that many of the best books about
Mexico	LOCATION	are now out of print , wliile American interest in the Mexican situation and the progres -

		THE DIAL 379 sive movement among the Mexicans make a new work , whose aim is to give reliable information rather than to advance radical theories , f > articularly timely .

		The book is illustrated by some fifty photo - graphs , reproduced in sepia .

		These were taken by the antlior and his travelling companion , Mr.
C. B. Birt	PERSON	Akt ANT -RRB- Architecture .

		Miss
Estelle M. Hui-U	PERSON	's volume on '' Portraits and Portrait Painting '' -LRB- Page -RRB- deals with a branch of art which the amateur student is likely to find both diffi - cult of approach and unattractive ; and accordingly it has been generally avoided by the writers of popu - lar art-manuals .

		Miss Hurll , however , has braved prejudice and chosen the field of portraiture for ex - ploitation in her latest Ijook .

		The studies are effec - tively illustrated in sepia half-tones , which reproduce a representative collection of great portraits , from
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's time to
Sargent 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		A brief but very signi - ficant introduction puts the tyro right upon the gen - eral principles of portrait-painting , suggesting the correspondence between poi-traiture and literary biography , explaining the interpretative , aesthetic , and photographic purposes of the art , the difference between the subjective and objective methods , and the general relation between the painter and his time and environment With these interests in mind , the reader embarks the more readily upon the main body of the text , which is a brief survey of portrait painting from the Middle Ages to the present , show - ing what each age and nationality has contributed to the art , with some information about the people who , often quite by chance , have been fortunate enough to be the subjects of famous portraits .

		`` It is impossible to put one 's finger upon a definite date for the origin of portrait painting , '' Miss Hurll ex - plains , because it grew gradually out of religious figure-painting ; but the general reader will be well satisfied to begin with the Italian painters of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries .

		Titian ,
Dilrer	PERSON	,
Holbein	LOCATION	,
Rubens	PERSON	,
Van Dyke	LOCATION	,
Frans Hals	PERSON	.

		Rem - brandt , and
Velasquez	PERSON	are accorded detailed study , and there are general chapters dealing with schools and tendencies .

		The ability , alreatly noticed in con - nection with the preface , to hold the reader 's inter - est by a crisp style , and by a skilful presentation of salient points and large issues , is evident throughout the book , which is an unusually satisfactory example of its class .

		The preface to the first edition of Mr.
Kenyon Cox	PERSON	's '' Old Ma-sters and New , '' published without illustrations in
1905	DATE	, gave promise of a future edition , augmented and enlarged , in which those masters and others , old and new , should be treated of .

		The pub - lishers decided , however , that an entirely different collection of essays should be offered , rather than an enlarged edition of the first series , and '' Painters and Sculptors '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , handsomely bound and profusely illustrated with upwards of a hundred full - page reproductions , many from rare and inaccessible originals , is the result That an artist may be quite as broad-minded in his views of art as any lajinan , the writings of Fromentin sufliciently attest ; that Mr.
Cox	PERSON	is an artist of equal catholicity of judgment is proved by the present volume , in which the artist - critic touches upon `` The Education of an Artist , '' `` The Pollaiuoli , '' `` Painters of the Mode , '' `` Hol - bein , '' '' The Rembrandt Tercentenary , '' ''
Rodin	PERSON	, '' and `` Lord
Leighton	PERSON	. ''

		Through these pages we are helped to acquaintance with the artists whose names figure in the chapter headings , shown their points of view , and given a general insight into their pictorial methods and motives .

		It is a careful and detailed work , which will of course appeal especially to students of art , the numerous illustrations being valuable adjuncts to an appreciation of the great masters ' work .

		With these , and a tasteful binding , the volume is one of the attractive holiday books of the season .

		`` Famous Painters of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
J. Walker McSpadden	PERSON	, is a book about painters rather than a book about painting .

		Eleven men -- West ,
Copley	LOCATION	,
Stuart Inness	PERSON	,
Vedder	PERSON	,
Winslow	LOCATION	, Homer , La Farge ,
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Sargent Abbey	LOCATION	, and Chase -- are the subjects of as many biographical sketches .

		The author 's aim is to give a readable , picturesque account of the artists as men , telling how their im - pulse to paint first showed itself , how they worked behind their easels , and how they lived among their friends .

		There is only the most casual effort to appraise an artist 's work or estimate his standing , though the story of the origin of a picture is given , where it has a human interest and there are some descriptions of paintings , but always from the prac - tical observer 's point of view .

		Mr.
McSpadden	PERSON	is a lively chronicler , and understands the art of telling an effective anecdote , as well as of judicious quota - tion from memoirs , autobiography , and magazine reminiscences .

		There is a bibliog ^ phy for the use of students who wish to pursue their researches further , and forty excellent pictures of the painters and their work .

		The make-up of the book is decidedly attrac - tive , and while its point of view is popular there is nothing superficial about its method .

		The season 's addition to
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's guides to the art galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	is `` The Art of the Prado , '' written by Mr.
Charles S. Ricketts	PERSON	.

		It is imiform with other volumes in the series , bound in cloth , appropriately decorated , and profusely illustrated with full-page plates in duogravure .

		The Prado gallery is probably one of the least known , as it is certainly one of the most interesting , among the world 's great treasure-houses of art In a suc - cinct introductory chapter , Mr.
Ricketts	PERSON	explains the general character of the collection , which he de - scribes as less complete and constructive than the
Louvre	LOCATION	, wider in range than the galleries of
Venice	LOCATION	, MUan , or
Antwerp	LOCATION	.

		-- as a whole the result of magni - ficent art patronage exercised , at particularly for - tunate moments and without too much national bias , to produce '' a gallery of masterpieces . ''

		Among these , the collection is rich in works of
Rubens	LOCATION	,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, and the Italian painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ; while all the greatest pictures 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, of
Velasquez	LOCATION	, with four or five exceptions , are to be found here , and there is no other place where the specialist can study the Spanish school .

		On the other hand .

		Van Dyke 's portrait work is poorly represented , and there is an almost total absence of Italian Prim - itives , except Fra Angelico and
Mantegna	PERSON	.

		When he embarks xipon detailed criticism , Mr.
Ricketts	PERSON	is fortunate in his ability to awaken and to hold his readers ' attention .

		He apportions his space about evenly between the Spanish painters and the out - siders , so to speak .

		He does not burden his pages with detail imintelligible to everyone except the few who read his book in direct connection with their visits to the
Prado	LOCATION	; and he does understand how to give his criticism a turn which is at once illuminat - ing and suggestive .

		The plates are of excellent quality , and their subjects are wisely chosen .

		Since Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	withdrew from the field of black-and-white illustration , Mr.
Hannson Fisher	PERSON	has taken his place as the matinee-idol , so to speak , among illustrators , and the painter ` par excellence of the beautiful American girl and the weU-dressed and well-groomed men who naturally dog her footsteps .

		This account of the matter is fair neither to Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	nor Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	, because it allows popularity of subject-matter and facility of style to obscure masterly workmanship , a gift for pictorial anecdote , aiid a keen appreciation of the '' human comedy '' of life and love .

		`` The
Harrison	PERSON	Fisher Book '' of pic - tures , which Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons publish , contains work in both black-and-white and in color , including illustrations of popular novels , pictures which have appeared in various magazines , and many drawings hitherto unpublished , -- altogether a repre - sentative selection from the artist 's best work .

		The cover-design is a ``
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	girl '' done in color .

		Illustrated Books of Fiction .

		Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	has found an extremely tempting title for his new volume of stories and essays .

		`` Days Off and Other Digressions '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- suggests all sorts of vague and therefore delightful possibilities , which Dr. van Dyke brings to realiza - tion in his characteristically charming fashion .

		The introductory essay states that '' A day o # E is a day that a man takes to himself , '' explains this thesis , and suggests modestly that the essays interspersed among the stories , on day-off opinions and preju - dices , are merely chapters to be read or skipped , as the reader 's day-oif humor pleases .

		Furthermore , nothing in the book is meant '' to prove anything , or convince anybody , or convey any profitable in - struction '' ; it is only a book to `` browse through '' in one 's days off .

		The first story , with its ironic title , '' A Holiday in a Vacation , '' certainly belongs in the book .

		The next is a `` Fisherman 's Luck '' tale , telling how
Bolton Chichester	PERSON	of the Petrine Clnb went fishing when he was engaged to be mar - ried , and thereby met with a singular adventure . ''

		Books that I Loved as a Boy , '' '' Notions about Novels , '' and '' The Art of Leaving Off '' are written in informal conversational style , and are based on distinctly day-off philosophy .

		Among the nature essays and animal stories , '' Silver-horns '' will pro- bably raise fresh doubts in the minds of some naturalists , whUe '' Little Red Tom '' is labelled '' A Contribution to the Fight about Nature Books . ''

		A number of attractively tinted illustrations and an artistic cover-design give a decorative touch to a volume that is sure to be a favorite with holiday shoppers .

		One of the prettiest novelettes of this season , as well as one of the most delightful from a literary point of view , is Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	's '' The Old Peabody Pew '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It appears in holiday dress with colored illustrations by Miss
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	, and festive page decorations and end-papers in color .

		Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's sub-title , '' A Christmas Romance of a Country Church , '' states tersely the three elements that combine to produce the simple little story 's charm .

		There is the Christ - mas spirit , which makes the book an especially appropriate holiday gift , there is romance , -- the inevitable feature of successful fiction , -- and there is the genuine atmosphere of old
New England	LOCATION	, easy enough to counterfeit , but very difficult to reproduce in a fashion that will create the illusion of reality for those who have intimate knowledge of the quiet little villages clustering about their white-spired churches , with their
Dorcas Societies	PERSON	, their Peabody Pews , and their humble romances .

		The story appeared some two years ago in one of the magazines ; in covers -- especially in covers as pretty as those which have been provided for it -- it is sure to find hosts of new readers . ''

		Holly '' is a Southern girl , beautiful of course , and fascinating to the verge of distraction , whUe her inexperience , her orphaned state , and her `` re - duced circumstances '' lend the needed touch of pathos to the portrait .

		HoUy lived in a house which she supposed was her own , but which really , through a series of curious accidents , belonged to a certain Mr.
Winthrop	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		He , supposing it to be empty , came down to
Florida	LOCATION	to occupy his prop - erty during a much needed vacation -- and found
Holly	PERSON	.

		His invalid state disarmed
Holly	PERSON	of her sec - tional prejudices , but there are plenty of other com - plications -- including an irascible Southern suitor approved by all
Holly	ORGANIZATION	's friends -- to make a lively story .

		It is related by Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	, well known as a writer of clever novelettes .

		Being longer and more ambitious than his previous efforts , it is natural that it should not be quite so well finished .

		Nevertheless `` Holly '' is a pretty story , prettUy bound , and illustrated in line and color by Mr.
Edwin F. Bayha	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Lippincott . -RRB-

		`` Gallantry '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the odd title bestowed by Mr.
James Branch Cabell	PERSON	upon a collection of twelve of his eighteenth century tales , reprinted , with considerable additions , from various magazines .

		One of them , '' In the Second AprU , '' was accom - panied , when it appeared in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' by four colored illustrations done by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	.

		These are reproduced with the new version .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 The distinctive character of Mr.
Cahell	PERSON	's short-story type is too well known to need much comment .

		His stories are studies of temperament , of epochs , of '' precious '' stylistic effects ; but the story-interest invariably remains strong . ''

		Gallantry , '' it appears from the quaint '' Epistle Dedicatory to Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	, '' is Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's characterization of the atti - tude of the eighteenth century towards life .

		His description of the gallant is , a bit of very pretty writing in prose , pleasantly suggestive , as is the versified prologue , of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	. '

		• My Lady Caprice , '' by Mr.
Jetfery Farnol	PERSON	, has already been printed in magazine form under another title -- `` Chronicles of the Imp . ''

		It is now pub - lished by
Messi	ORGANIZATION	`` s. Dodd ,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with four colored pictures by Miss
Cliarlotte Weber Ditzler	PERSON	, besides decorated headings and page-borders , and a pretty cover from which the '' Lady Caprice '' her - self , done in facsimile of a gold-framed miniature , looks mockingly out at the reader .

		The comedy of which she is heroine is set in
London	LOCATION	and at
Selwyn Park	LOCATION	, countiy-seat of the attractive young English - man whom a titled aunt of the capricious
Miss Elizabeth	LOCATION	has selected as her niece 's future husband .

		But the Imp , who is
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's nephew , and the hero , who tells his own story , conspire to defeat this plan .

		The Imp is decidedly the most ingenious and interesting person in the book , but the Lady 's posi - tion as the central figure in the romance furnishes good warrant for giving her the title-r6le .

		In the '' Little Novels of Famous Cities '' series -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- appears Mr.
Duffield Osborne	PERSON	's pretty story of old-time
Perugia	LOCATION	, entitled '' The Angels of
Messer Ercole	PERSON	. ''

		The small size of the book , its decorated cover and page-borders , and the sepia-tinted illus - trations -- from photogi-aphs of
Perugia	LOCATION	, her master - painters , and their works -- are the holiday features of the edition .

		The story , which has been printed before , relates how Ercole da Passigno , humble pupil in painting of
Pietro Vaimucci	PERSON	, `` The Perugian , '' became a bold lover , daring to lift his eyes to the golden-haired Princess Ottavia Baglioni ; and how between them they defied '' coward caution and the pride of princes '' and made their dream of love come true .

		Staxdakd Literature et Holiday Form .

		Undoubtedly the most sumptuous of the illustrated new editions of the year is Messrs. Button 's reprint of `` The Ingoldsby Legends , '' with pictures by Mr.
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	's illustrations for ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' were so popular last fall as to create an urgent demand for more of his work , new or old ; and accordingly a small English edition of '' The Ingoldsby Legends , '' published in
1898	DATE	, has been used as a basis , so to speak , of a new definitive edi - tion .

		That is .

		some of the pen-and-ink drawings in the earlier edition have been reproduced for the new one , with more or less re-drawing and on a larger scale to conform to the quarto size of the issue .

		Many of the twenty-four colored illusti-ations are quite new , and the rest have been worked over and especially colored .

		Great pains have been taken with the color-printing , and special mounts are used for the colored and the more ambitious line-drawings .

		The text has been entirely re-set , and the binding is buckram with decorations in gUt .

		But these details are of small moment compared with the essential fact that Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	has caught the fantastic humor of the '' Legends '' so perfectly that one feels for the first time his fuU power . ''

		Rip Van Winkle '' and even ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' furnished him with a relatively small opportunity .

		Therefore admirers of Mr
Rackham	PERSON	's very individual stj ` le will prefer these drawings to any of his previous work ; and persons who have been doubtful about the legitimacy of his effects and inclined to object to the loose rein he gives his imagination will find in the
Rackham	LOCATION	'' Ingoldsby Legends '' further evidence on which to base their distaste .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	honor the cen - tennial of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's birth by the publication of a new illustrated edition of `` The Hanging of the Crane , '' daintily bound and elegantly printed .

		The publisher 's note repeats
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	's interesting account of the origin of the poem , and explains that the dozen illustrations , which are done in color by Mr.
Arthur I. Keller	PERSON	, were actually made at
Craigie House	ORGANIZATION	, where the poem was written and most of the scenes which it relates were enacted .

		The colonial architecture of the house also furnishes motives for many of the text decorations by
Miss Florence Swan	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is needless to say that the edition is mechanically a very beautiful one , well worthy of the anniversary that calls it forth .

		One of the prettiest of the season 's holiday productions is
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's illustrated translation of `` Immensee , '' Theodore Storm 's idyllic masterpiece .

		Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	, the translator , furnishes , besides a sing ^ arly grace - ful rendering of the text , an interesting apprecia - tion of Storm and his work .

		The illustrations and decorations are done by
Margaret	PERSON	and
Helen Maitland Armstrong	PERSON	, whose artistic cooperation is responsible for some of our most beautiful decorated editions .

		The water-lily , which was
Reinhardt	PERSON	's symbol for his lost love , is the decorative motive on pages and cover .

		Nine delicately tinted illustrations reflect the lyric sentiment and restrained pathos of the text .

		`` Old comedies are mostly those which , in spite of their being more than a hundred years old , are yet lively and sprightly enough to amuse a modern audience . ''

		So writes Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	in an appreciative introduction to a new illustrated edi - tion of `` The Rivals '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		There is no ques - tion that `` The Rivals '' is `` lively and sprightly enough '' to please modern audiences , and modern readers too .

		Mr.
Power O'Malley	PERSON	has illustrated the play for the present edition in a fashion to em - phasize both its old-time quaintness and its sparkling humor .

		His eighteen pictures are reproduced in photogravure , except the frontispiece , which is col - ored .

		Typography and binding are artistic .

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons publish a beautiful holiday reprint of George Wither 's ''
Christmas Carroll	PERSON	, '' with pictures and ornamental text done by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	.

		The ''
Carroll	PERSON	'' is printed twice , once in ornamental lettering , a couplet or a quatrain to a page , with dainty pen-and-ink drawings above and below it and on the opposite page ; and again in type , plain and unadorned , at the back of the book .

		A brief note on the poet 's life is also included .

		The end-leaves of this edition are espe - cially attractive ; and so is the cover , which depends upon fancy lettering and color for its adornment .

		A particularly attractive Christmas anthology is that compiled by
Miss Ina	ORGANIZATION	RusseUe Warren , chiefly from the work of the older English poets .

		Of course there is no possibility of finding all one 's old favor - ites in so small a collection , but there will surely be several of them in `` Under theHoUy Bough '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book is illustrated vnth sepia half-tones , separ - ately mounted .

		The cover-decoration is a sort of composite of mistletoe and hoUy , the leaves being of the hoUy shape , but the berries , for some strange reason , colored white instead of red .

		Miscellaneous Holiday Books .

		Unique among the publications of this or any year is `` The Indians ' Book , '' `` recorded and edited `` by Miss
Natalie Curtis	PERSON	, and published with every pos - sible advantage of typography and color-printing by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title-page de - scribes the book as `` an offering by the American Indians of Indian lore , musical and narrative , to form a record of the songs and legends of their race , '' with illustrations from photographs and from original drawings by Indians .

		There is a curious foreword by
Hiamori	PERSON	, Chief among the Cheyennes and the
Dakotas	LOCATION	, and one of the most enthusiastic and helpful of the contributors to the work . ''

		I want all Indians and white men to read , '' he says , `` and learn how the Indians lived and thought in the olden time , and may it bring holy-good upon the younger Indians to know of their fathers .

		A little while , and the old Indians wUl no longer be , and the young will be even as white men . ''

		This is , in brief , the double purpose of the book ; its originality consists in the fact that
Miss Cmtis	LOCATION	has literally done nothing but coUect , edit , and aiTange contri - butions actually made by the Indians .

		The songs and stories are theirs , chosen by the chiefs of the different tribes and their people , often after long and earnest considei'ation , as being the most worthy to be preserved among the lore of the tribe .

		The drawings , cover-design , and title-pages are all the free-hand work of Indians , although sometimes they have used an inverted basket to form a circle .

		The interesting lettering on the tribal title-pages , of which there are twenty-fom - , each with a char - acteristic symbolic design by a member of the tribe , was done by Miss Angel De
Cora	PERSON	of the Winnebagoes , art instructor at the
Carlisle Indian School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Curtis	PERSON	's Introduction explains how she collected her material , going by rail , wagon , or on horseback from tribe to tribe ; offering friendship , and every - where meeting a warm response and hearty coopera - tion in her work , in which her part was planned to be that of `` the white friend come to be the pencil in the hand of the Indians . ''

		She carried to the camps and villages only a note-book and pencil , a camera , and a color-box for the use of the Indians ; and she wrote down their songs and stories as she listened to them `` by the light of the tipi fire or under the glare of the desert sun , in adobe houses while the women ground the corn , or in the open camp where after some festival or ceremonial gathering a leader re-sang for the book a character - istic song . ''

		She respected their superstitions and reserves , tried to represent all types of thought and all sides of life , especially to get at the primitive motives and notions of a primitive race , and to re - cord the stories and songs of the very oldest men .

		These were often entirely unknown to the younger tribesmen , and sometimes were even told in archaic language .

		Perhaps the best recommendation that
Miss Curtis	PERSON	's work as editor , translator , and musical transcriber can have is the Indians ' testimony that her book '' speaks with the straight tongue , '' and the eagerness with which they have awaited its appear - ance .

		To most of its white readers the book will be a revelation of the vaguely stirring genius and the art , mystic in its intent , spontaneous in its symbolism , of a child race .

		It seems almost incredible , in view of the recent popularity of biography , that
John Harvard	PERSON	's life should have waited untU now to be written .

		But the fact is that while his name became a household word in
America	LOCATION	long before
George Washington	LOCATION	's , absolutely nothing was known about him save that he was a minister of God and '' gave gifts '' ; so that when in
1842	DATE	,
James Savage	PERSON	offered a reward of five hundred doUars for five lines of information about
John Harvard	PERSON	in any private or public capacity , no one could claim it .

		Since then , however , the baptis - mal entry in the archives of
St. Saviour 's Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Southwark	LOCATION	, has been discovered , and assiduous re - search has unearthed some other facts and suggested many theories .

		And now comes the first biography , written by Mr.
Henry C. SheUey	PERSON	and entitled ''
John Harvard	PERSON	and His Times '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		`` The pioneer is liable to take a wrong trail now and then , '' explains Mr.
SheUey	PERSON	, modestly , in his pre - face ; '' and some allowances will no doubt be made on that score . ''

		But Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	shows himself ac - curate and unbiased in stating his slender store of absolutely determined facts , and singularly clever in piecing them together and eking them out with ingenious possibilities .

		One of the most interest - ing of these is involved in his attempt to prove , by a chain of circumstantial evidence , that the par - ents of
John Harvard	PERSON	were introduced to each other by
WiUiam Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Throughout his account he aims to '' place ''
John Harvard	PERSON	in his environ - ment , English and American , and thus to make a firm background for the somewhat attenuated out - line sketch , which further investigation may modify
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 or fill out The biography is appropriately hound in
Harvard	LOCATION	crimson , with the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	crest and other decorations in gold , and there are a number of inter - esting and apposite illustrations from photographs .

		`` There were once two people who supposed that they had lived a happy life .

		To be sure , the Man Had Always Wanted a Farm , and the Woman Had Never Wanted a
Country House	ORGANIZATION	; but they had jogged along in comfortable and contented fashion for years and years , until that fateful moment when they walked one day in a forest . ''

		So Mrs.
Frances Kinsley Hutvhinson	PERSON	begins her account of '' Our Country Home '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- which the man who had always wanted a farm , and the woman who had changed her mind about having a country house , together built and beautified .

		The forest which in - spired them was a bit of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	woodland along the shore of a lovely little lake .

		They bought seventy - two acres of it , and leaving all but a small part un - touched except for a roadway leading through it , planned a house and garden for the part bordering on the lake .

		An architect and a landscape gardener were calle < l in to draw up a general scheme , but the owners constituted themselves a consulting staff , in which was vested the final authority .

		They were in no hurry to finish their house ; they realized that as a matter of fact it could never be finished , and that , if it should ever seem to be so .

		the fun would be over .

		Pictures of the house in its first and second years , of an upstairs porch before and after three years of vine culture , and of the formal gfarden in its various stages , show that a woodland home can - not be made , but must grow .

		The illustrations in the volume , which are made from photographs by the author , are a decided feature of interest .

		There are nearly two hundred of them , picturing the house from various vantage-points and showing many in - teresting bits of detail , practical as well as artistic .

		Mrs.
Hutchinson	PERSON	tells her story most entertainingly , giving many suggestions to readers who are inter - ested in having country homes of their own .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	may be unfailingly relied upon to add a volume or two to each year 's quota of illus - trated books , for which , with versatility unusual in these days of specialization he furnishes both text and illustrations .

		This year , instead of exploring some new field with note-book and camera , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has chosen to revise and greatly enlarge two of his eai ` ly volumes , first issued some ten years ago and now published as companion volumes by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The titles are '' The Farmer 's Boy '' and '' The Country School . ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	was a
New England	LOCATION	farmer 's boy , and he firmly believes that there is more fun in being that particu - lar kind of boy than in being any other imaginable kind .

		His recollections are therefore pleasant , though not so rose-colored that they lack the note of reality .

		Readers who have had similar experiences will find Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	a very competent conductor back to the happy land of childhood ; and those who have never been
New England	LOCATION	boys and girls -- for Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	finds it impossible to leave out the g ^ ls from the story -- will enjoy the book just as much , since boys are boys the world over .

		The memories of district-school , based on Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's experiences and those of his friends , are also written informally , as the story of one child 's school-days .

		Both books gain a unique interest from the fact that the life they picture is passing away ; district schools are being deserted , the telephone and the rural mail service have altered the distinctive tone of
New England	LOCATION	farm life , and it is now if ever that the record of the older period must be written .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	does not explain how he got his photographs of old-time boys and girls .

		Most likely he hunted out suitable sub - jects in some remote corner of rural
New England	LOCATION	.

		But however obtained , the pictures are certainly interesting and effective .

		Mrs.
Lucy FitchPerkins	PERSON	assures us that she is aloyal Westerner , but her '' Book of Joys '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- tells of a
spring	DATE	and
summer	DATE	spent in two quaintNew
England	LOCATION	villages , in old houses of the sort that stand far back from the street , shaded by elms and pines , with lilac bushes along the front path and apple-trees , laden with flowers or fruit in season , in the back yard .

		Mrs.
Perkins	PERSON	is keenly alive to both the delights and the limitations of the old-school
New England	LOCATION	life , seeing it with the clear eyes of an alien who is sympathetic to its charm but fully conscious of its whimsicalities and oddities .

		Being city-bred , Mrs.
Perkins	PERSON	feels the lack of congenial society in the country , but with characteristic optimism she finds compensation in '' a more intimate acquaintance with cats and dogs and other live-stock ; and , '' she adds , '' if one agreed with the misanthropist who said that the more he saw of men the better he liked dogs , it might he considered a fair exchange . ''

		However , the neighborhood of
Marston Hill	ORGANIZATION	is not a solitude .

		There are Cousin
Henrietta	PERSON	and her husband , who own the place ; there is Barney Bump , who helped buUd them a rustic pergola , expostulating , mean - while , that '' it looked so wild you 'd expect gorillars to come out on it any minute '' ; and there is the '' little dove-colored lady '' who had a distractingly beautiful old-fashioned garden , but whose ideas about
Chicago	LOCATION	temporarfly snapped the
summer	DATE	's speU of joy for Mrs.
Perkins	PERSON	.

		And at the old homestead there were a Bride and
Groom Elect	ORGANIZATION	, and a large family party gathered to attend their wedding , which furnishes a fitting climax to the
summer	DATE	's pleasures .

		Mrs.
Perkins	PERSON	, being hitherto known rather as an artist than as an author , has naturally chosen to illustrate '' A Book of Joys '' herself , providing five full-page drawings in color , and for a cover design an inset colored picture of an elm-shaded farm-house .

		People who like old furniture and who like still better to go in pursuit of it and to discover it in the most unlikely places , will look far before finding a book so exactly to their taste as
Robert	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Shackleton	PERSON	's '' The Quest of the Colonial '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume is illustrated by many excellent and useful photographs of tj ` pical styles of old furniture , brass , silver , etc. , and is given a decora - tive touch by the addition of a colored frontispiece 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, and appropriate head and tail pieces cleverly drawn by Mr.
Harry Fenn	PERSON	.

		It contains a great deal of definite and accurately stated information for the amateur collector , besides many anecdotes calculated to quicken his enthusiasm and arouse his envy and admiration .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Shackleton	PERSON	went on exploring tours all through the East and South , and made many discoveries , some of which they bore home in triumph , while others , even finer , were left in the hands of too-avaricious dealers or too-wealthy rivals .

		But the true collector counts possession only one joy -- though the crowning one -- among the many that go to make up his experiences .

		Not the least of these are involved in the necessity of suitably housing his antiques , and not the least interest of Mr. and Mrs.
Shackleton	PERSON	's book is the account it gives of their making over their house to tit the sort of furniture they preferred .

		Of course a book that touches upon so many branches of the large subject of '' Antiques '' can not be exhaustive , but the begin - ner does not want exhaustive treatises ; he wants to be guided through the first stages of promiscuous buying .

		This is what Mr. and Mrs.
Shackleton	PERSON	offer to do for him .

		Incidentally they give much encour - agement to the buyer of small means , assuring him that even the choicest specimens are within his reach if he knows where to go for them .

		Books on old furniture are having at the present time a vogue similar to that given to books on natural history a few years since .

		The subject , in its various relations to history and economics , and to the prin - ciples of art and construction , is one that admits of a great variety of treatment .

		A recent contri - butor to the literature of old furniture is Mr.
Fred Roe	PERSON	, whose '' Ancient Coffers and Cupboards , '' pub - lished in
1902	DATE	, is now followed by '' Old Oak Fur - niture '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		In this volume the author 's interest in his subject is that of the antiquary , the collector , and the artist .

		His illustrations are fur - nished from his own drawings , including the beau - tiful frontispiece of a handsome sideboard in his possession , reproduced in color .

		His '' Seventeenth - Century Chair , '' indexed to be shown on the title - page , however , appears to have been lost from the book , possibly in the American edition only .

		The author gives little in the way of scientific classifica ^ tion , and enlightens his readers but little regarding the development of the various styles of domestic furniture , but wi'ites always with the collector in mind , ready to warn him against forgeries and other pitfalls which beset the path of lovers of old oak , and incidentally tells of certain traditions attached to some famous articles of furniture in the native English oak , which , in the hands of English work - men , assumed a distinctive character of its own about the time of Elizabeth . ''


Browning	PERSON	's
Italy	LOCATION	'' is the somewhat misleading though intrinsically correct title of an interesting study of Italian life and art as it is interpreted in
Browning	PERSON	's poetry .

		The book is written by Miss
Helen Archibald Clarke	PERSON	, and published with a de - corative cover-design , fancy end-leaves , and some two dozen photographic illustrations of present-day
Italy	LOCATION	, by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fact is that
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's types are so vivid , and his situations so intensely dramatic , that the average reader has to think twice before he realizes that they belong to the Middle Ages , and that ''
Browning	PERSON	's
Italy	LOCATION	'' means
Italy	LOCATION	of the Renaissance .

		Miss
Clarke	PERSON	classifies
Browning	PERSON	's Italian interests under five chapter-headings : The Dawn of the Renaissance , Glimpses of Political Life , The Italian Scholar , The Artist and His Art , and
Pictures of Social Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		For each she supplies the needed background of history , connecting it with the poetry by liberal quotations , -- a method which makes possible the extension of her audience beyond the limited circle of those who know
Browning	PERSON	thor - oughly .

		On the other hand , the historical studies are complete enough to interest students of
Browning	PERSON	, because of the new light they cast on the sources of his love for
Italy	LOCATION	and on the relation between the historic facts of the records and his poetic inter - pretation of them .

		A whimsical bibelot , which may be counted upon to please fastidious readers , both in substance and mechanical features , is Mrs.
Anna Benneson Mc	PERSON	-
Mahan	PERSON	's ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Gift to Queen Bess '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		It relates in a simple vivid style that gets a quaint coloring from the archaic type , the story of the court presentation of '' Midsummer Night 's Dream '' before Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	in the Christmas revels at
Whitehall Palace	ORGANIZATION	in
1596	DATE	.

		Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	handles her story with a light touch that deftly conceals much genuine erudition .

		Her treatment is fanciful and suggestive , but at the same time has an air of verisimilitude that takes her read - ers back to the
Mermaid Tavern	ORGANIZATION	, crowded on a
Club night	TIME	, and to the Queen 's Palace , decked for a festi - val and thronged with Elizabethan lords and ladies .

		There are many pretty illustrations picturing the setting of the tale , and the cover-design is a unique conception .

		Among all the holiday books of the season none is more thoroughly artistic in binding , decoration , and make-up than '' Gods and Heroes of Old Japan '' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- .

		Miss
Ada Galton	PERSON	is responsible for the decorative features , and Miss Violet
M. Pasteur	PERSON	for the text .

		This latter consists of short stories taken from the sacred writings and ancient histories of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Some are legendary and miraculous ; others correspond to the tales of our own age of chivalry .

		They are simply and gracefully told , with a quaintness that suits the primitive type of the stories .

		The wide page margins are decorated in tint , with a great variety of graceful floral designs and with odd little figures in attitudes that are fuU of meaning and suggestion .

		Many of these sketches are after
Hokusai	ORGANIZATION	and other old masters .

		There are also four full-page drawings in color , -- one of them , `` The Iris Page , '' being perhaps the crown - ing feature of the book .

		Decorated end-leaves and an attractively designed cover complete a book sure to please those who appreciate Japanese art and are interested in oriental mythologies .

		NOTES 432 LIST OF NT : W BOOKS 432 THU WHIT TIER CENTENARY .

		When the hard-pressed Spartans sent to
Athens	LOCATION	for a leader at the time of the Mes - senian war , they were not a little surprised when there came to them , instead of the soldier they expected , a lame schoolmaster .

		But his songs proved more potent than strategy , and so inspired them that they won their cause .

		No less striking an adjustment of unexpected means to unforeseen ends is found in the history of our own great national conflict which issued in the triumph of human liberty .

		It was of
Emerson	LOCATION	that
Lowell	PERSON	wrote : '' To him more than to aU other causes together did the young martyrs of our Ci \ Tl War owe the sustaining strength of thoughtful heroism that is so touch - ing in every record of their lives . ''

		But the words fit
Whittier	LOCATION	almost as well , and the in - spiring influence of our Quaker Tyrtaeus , even more directly than the spiritual counsels of our Puritan sage , kindled the fires of devotion that ' consumed our fortress of vested wronff .

		It is j highly significant for the spiritual interpretation I of the Civil War that its outcome shoidd be 1 so largely attributable to these two men , both i having the temperament of the recluse , and both forced by the pressure of events to come out into the open and address plain speech to their fellow-men upon the commanding prac - tical question of their time .

		We celebrated the
Emerson	LOCATION	centenary four years ago ; to-day , fifteen years after his death , we celebrate the centenary of
John Greenleaf Whittier	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was years before
Emerson	PERSON	said , '' There is an infamy in the air , '' that
Whittier	LOCATION	--
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	and man of peace -- took the militant attitude toward the institution of slavery .

		In the early thirties , when
Emerson	PERSON	was still rather repelled by the vehemence of the reformers ,
Whittier	LOCATION	had allied himself with Garrison , and enlisted for the war . ''

		My heart both leaped to answer thine , And echo back thy words .

		As leaps the warrior 's at the shine And flash of kindred swords . ''

		And from that time on , until the breaking of the storm-cloud of war , he was outspoken and uncompromising in his stand for righteousness , although still trying hard to reconcile the need 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, for action with the spirit of non-resistance .

		Lowell pictures him in
1848	DATE	as '' Both singing and striking in front of the war .

		And hitting his foes with the mallet of Thor , '' and others than
Lowell	PERSON	must have wonderingly '' O leather-clad Fox , Can that be thy son , in the battle 's mad din .

		Preaching brotherly love and then driving it in To the brain of the tough old Goliath of sin .

		With the smoothest of pebbles from
Caataly	ORGANIZATION	's
spring	DATE	Impressed on his hard moral sense with a sling ' ! ''

		And so for more than thirty years , and until the end of the war was in sight , he fought stoutly on , and was at last free to raise the paean of his ''
Laus Deo	PERSON	. '' ''

		Ring and swing .

		Bells of joy I On morning 's wing Send the song of praise abroad !

		With a soimd of broken chains Tell the nations that He reigns Who alone is Lord and God ! ''

		When the long conflict was over , and the political passion that had hitherto inspired his song had achieved its aim ,
Whittier	LOCATION	found his intimate self once more , and became what Nature had all along meant him to be -- the poet of his own native section . ''

		Snow - Bound '' and '' The Tent on the Beach '' are the works by which he is likely to live the longest , because of the sincerity and fidelity with which they picture what is now a fast - vanishing phase of American civilization .

		They are the pieces which make him peculiarly the poet of
New England	LOCATION	, and justify
Parkman	PERSON	's exact description : '' His genius drew its nourishment from her soil ; his pages are the mirror of her outward nature , and the strong utterance of her inward life . ''

		The course of the twentieth century will carry
New England	LOCATION	far from those conditions of primitive simplicity which made a poet like
Whittier	LOCATION	possible , and that body of his work which enshrines for pos - terity the old homely life which nurtured him will grow increasingly precious as that life , with all its accidents , recedes into the past .

		Among
Whittier	LOCATION	's titles to our gratitude two have been considered -- his championship of the cause of freedom and his industry as a chron - icler of
New England	LOCATION	life and legend .

		A third chief title is based upon his religious poems .

		The atmosphere of Puritanism in which he grew up was tonic but harsh , and needed the soft - ening breath of airs from some milder source of spiritual refreshment .

		The principles of Quakerism supplied just this need , and produced in
Whittier	LOCATION	the fortunate blend of strength and gentleness , of austerity and tolerance , that made his religious utterances so singularly appealing .

		He had the vision of the '' One faith alone , so broad that all mankind Within themselves its secret witness find , The soul 's communion with the Eternal Mind , '' and in many a simple and touching strain he impaii `` d that vision to restless souls seeking after peace .

		There is nothing that is offen - sively dogmatic in his religious verse , only the pure gold of aspiration for the good and faith in its ultimate realization .

		It is safe to say that
Whittier	LOCATION	's fame as a poet has steadily brightened during the years since his death .

		There was a time when criti - cism viewed him with a supercilious air , dwell - ing upon his perfectly obvious limitations , his lack of fuiish , his defect of ear , and the general crudity of many of his improvisations .

		These things obscured the critical vision , and pre - vented his entire work from being seen in its true perspective .

		We do not now dwell upon them so much , because his qualities of positive excellence are seen to be more deserving of attention .

		He has been variously compared to
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	,
Cowper	PERSON	, and
Burns	PERSON	, and even to
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		The comparisons may not be close , but the fact that he suggests thepi at all is significant .

		The faithful and minute realism of his
New England	LOCATION	descriptive pieces more than confirms the likeness with
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, and the lyrical quality of
Burns	PERSON	, his acknowledged master , is echoed in many of his
New England	LOCATION	songs and ballads .

		It was a Southern poet ,
Paul Hayne	PERSON	, who spoke of his verse as '' rhythmic gold , '' and compared him with the poet of '' The Task '' in this quatrain : ''
Grod	PERSON	's innocent pensioners in the woodland dim .

		The fields , the pastures , know and trust in him , And in their love , his lonely heart is blest , Our pure hale-minded
Cowper	PERSON	of the West . ''

		As for
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	, if
Whittier	LOCATION	touches him at all , it is upon the idyllic side , and also in a few rare flashes of spiritual insight .

		We have often thought that the closing stanzas of '' Burning Drift - Wood '' would not suffer greatly if set in comparison even with the faultless stanzas of '' Crossing the Bar . ''

		Here they are , ready for the touch-stone . ''

		I hear the solemn monotone Of waters calling unto me , I know from whence the airs have blown That whisper of the Eternal Sea . ''

		As low my fires of drift-wood burn , I hear that sea 's deep sounds increase .

		And , fair in sunset light , discern Its mirage-lifted Isles of Peace . ''

		One word more , and this centennial tribute shall end .

		What have the younger poets learned of thee ?

		is the question once put by
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 409 Mr.
Stetlman	PERSON	, dedicating to
Whittier	LOCATION	a volume of verse .

		And the answer was this : '' Ri ^ hteons angler , bnmin ^ scorn Of the oppressor , love to hnniankind , Sweet fealty to country and to home , Peace , stainless purity , high thoughts of heaven .

		And the clear , natural music of thy song . ''

		But more significant than this incisive sxmi - mary is the title of the dedicatoiy lines -- '' Ad Vatem '' -- for it reminds us that the poet was also the prophet .

		All true poets are prophets in some degrees , but few wear the robes with
Whittier	LOCATION	's dignity .

		It is the authentic accent of prophecy that we hear in '' Ichabod '' -- as noble a poem as any of Hugo 's '' Chatiments '' -- and in the • ' Centennial Hymn ' '' whose stately measures embody a rational ideal not likely to become outworn . ''

		Oh make Thou us , through centuries long , In peace secure , in justice strong ; Around our gift of freedom draw The safeguards of thy righteous law : And , cast in some diviner mould .

		Let the new cycle shame the old ! ''

		SOME FRIENDSHIPS OF
WHITTIER	LOCATION	.

		WITH LETTEES HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED .

		Among the centenary thoughts on
Whittier	LOCATION	, impressed upon us by re-reading his published letters and listening to scattered reminiscences , has been a realization of the large and varied circle of friends who were recipients of his sympathetic and loyal good-will .

		With his contemporaries in literature , who are ranked to-day among the greater authors , he did not maintain cordial and free relations .

		In his young manhood he lacked educational and social opportunities to form such bonds of friendship ; in later life , his mingled shyness and ill-health pre - vented him from accepting many friendly invitations that came to him .

		For
Emerson	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	he had great admiration , but he was reserved and sometimes ill at ease in their company .

		In the
last decade	DATE	of his life he exchanged cordial notes of congratidation with
Holmes	PERSON	, as they shared successive birthdays with their honors .

		With three men of lettei-s he was on more intimate tenns of friendship , --
Edwin P. Whipple	PERSON	,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, and
James T.	PERSON	.

		Fields .

		For the women winters who came to him often for advice and encouragement , he had warm regai 'd , and his letters to them show real cordiality and often humorous responsiveness .

		His friendship with
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	and
Abigail Dodge	PERSON	-LRB- ``
Gail Hamilton	PERSON	'' -RRB- was expressed in many letters and in hours of hos - pitality at his
Amesbury	LOCATION	home .

		He was deeply interested in the literary achievements of two women who are still writing graceful prose and verse , Mrs.
Harriet Prescott	PERSON	SpofEord and
Miss Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	The former was his neighbor , when at her home near
Newburyport	LOCATION	, and with her and her husband
Whittier	LOCATION	had relations of true friendship .

		He acknowledged indebtedness to Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	for the germ-ideas of two of his poems , `` The King 's Missive '' and `` The Captain 's Well . ''

		Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	offered the story of Captain Valentine
Bagley	PERSON	and his well to
Whittier	LOCATION	before she wrote her poem , believing that `` all the legends of the countiyside belonged to him , '' but he did not then intend to use this story .

		The letter following , loaned by Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	and never before published , was written in
1882	DATE	, after the publication of her verses ; the tribute which
Whittier	LOCATION	paid to her poem may be applied also to his later rendering of the same tradition .

		`` Oak Kaoll ,
Danven	PERSON	, 8mo. , 17 ,
1882	DATE	. ''

		Mt dear Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	: '' I had the pleasure of meeting thy best friend in the cars the other day , and he told me that a copy of thy
Valentine Bagley	ORGANIZATION	poem had been sent to me .

		I searched my great pile of papers for it , but failed to find it until very lately .

		I have read it with the hearti - est satisfaction .

		The touching and beautiful story could not be better told .

		It is worth ten thousand dollars to
Amesbury	LOCATION	, and would be cheap at that , if thee had not given it to us .

		It has made the old well immortal .

		It has indissolubly wedded
Powow River	LOCATION	and the
Merri	PERSON	- mack with the Sea of
Oman	LOCATION	and the Cove of
Muscat	LOCATION	.

		Between the boughs of
Daniel Himtington	PERSON	's apple-trees the date-palms of Arabia will wave and rustle forever . ''

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	was associated in
Whittier	LOCATION	's life with those other friends , Mr. and Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	.

		Her stories of
New England	LOCATION	life gfave him rare pleasure .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	has allowed the publication of one of his letters to her which reveals his constant sympathy for his friends .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	was visiting Mrs. Fields in
Boston	LOCATION	at this time . ''


Amesbury	LOCATION	,

		My dear frlend : '' I wonder whether you know in
Charles	LOCATION	street how cold it is !

		The world seems freezing up , -- another ice-period is upon us .

		We are 18 degrees below zero here
this morning	TIME	.

		It must be terribly hard for the poor in your city .

		If it were not for such angels of mercy as our dear Annie Fields and her associates , what would become of them ? ''

		I enclose a long notice of thy writings by the literary editor of the
Providence	LOCATION	Daily Jotu-nal ,
Kate H. Austin	PERSON	, a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	friend of mine .

		If it gives thee half the pleasure it has given me , I shall be satisfied . ''

		Do n't let ... risk her life too much this terrible weather .

		I have been thinking of her daily outgoings ever since this awful wave of cold has rolled upon us .

		With a great deal of love for her , I am thy affectionate friend ,
Johjj G. WHrmER	PERSON	. ''

		Please hand the enclosed check to A. F. I want , in my small way , to share in her work , or if possible to relieve a little of the suffering she is obliged to witness . ''

		One of the memorable friendships of
Whittier	LOCATION	with another poet came in his later years , when
Paul Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	paid the visits to
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Whittier	LOCATION	which he has described in '' The Snow - Messengers . ''

		After that day at
Danvers	LOCATION	, in
1879	DATE	, 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the two poets , once so diametrically opposed in political faith , became friends whose correspond - ence gave mutual pleasure .

		Mr.
William Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	has permitted the use of two letters from
Whittier	LOCATION	to his father which are revelatory and gracious .

		The first is dated
November , 1880	DATE	.

		`` It is nearly a year ago since thee and dear Mrs.
Hayne	PERSON	were here .

		I was wishing this morning that you could see our trees , which
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	has painted more gloriously than ever before .

		How do you do ?

		The newspapers say thy health is better , but we were pained to hear of thy illness some months ago .

		For myself , I am feeling the effects of age : -- am rarely free from pain , and find all writing and serious thought very wearisome .

		I realize that there is little left for me but to trust and wait ... Yet I am thankful for the many blessings , -- for friends , for books , for the ever beautiful natiu-e , and hope that , despite of many errors and shortcomings , I have not lived wholly in vain .

		The poetical temperament has its trials and keen suscep - tibdity to the hard , harsh , and milovely things of life ; but , my dear friend , we have also a capacity for enjoy - ment which others do not know , -- ' the still air and deUghtful studies , ' the glow and enthusiasm of rhythmic utterance , and the rapturous love of all beauty and har - mony .

		And as
Holmes	PERSON	says , ' It is a satisfaction some - times to sit under a tree and read our own songs ... The election is at hand .

		However it goes , I hope the country will not suffer .

		I long for peace and kindly feeling . ''

		After the death of
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	wrote to Hayne : '' Ever since our great poet fell asleep , I have wanted to write thee , but I have scarcely courage or strength for the effort .

		I heard from my dear Mrs. Fields , who had visited him , that he was wishing to see me .

		As soon as I was able I went out from
Uoston	LOCATION	on the Sun - day of his last week .

		His daughter told nie he had been taken suddenly ill the night before , and it was not possible for him to see me or anyone .

		I was greatly grieved , but 1 hoped he was not seriously ill .

		He was more comfortable afterward but no permanent restora - tion .

		The last two days of his life he slept much and seemed quiet .

		And so he passed as from one lower cham - ber to one higher .

		Ah me !

		but the world seems the less for his leaving .

		And a feeling of great loneliness op - presses me .

		... I should have answered thy last letter but for illness and weakness .

		I am so dreadfully oppressed by my correspondence with strangers that I can not do justice to my friends .

		My letters for the last six mouths have been at the rate of twenty a day . ''

		In his earlier and later years alike ,
Whittier	LOCATION	had many friends among the Quakers whose faith he always maintained , while he was ever open-minded toward all creeds .

		He was interested in the scientific research and discussions which were wide-spread during the later decades of his life .

		In
1879	DATE	an
English Quaker	ORGANIZATION	,
Stanley Pumphrey	PERSON	, visited
Whittier	LOCATION	at
Oak Knoll	ORGANIZATION	, with some friends of the poet , Pliny and Thomas Chase .

		To his guests he spoke freely of his religious experiences and hopes .

		A record of the conversation was kept in a diary , from which I am privileged to quote these exti'acts .

		Referring to the seeming conflict between science and religion ,
Whittier	LOCATION	said : '' I am surprised at the anxiety of some religious teachers with regard to the effect of scientific investiga - tions .

		We must never be afraid of truth , and , more than that , truth can never conti'adict itself .

		Even evolution , if that can be proved , would not affect the doctrines we have been talking of '' In the same conversation
Whittier	LOCATION	spoke with earnest interpretation of the motives which suggested to him his poem on `` The Eternal Goodness . '' ''

		It was directed against the Calvinistic teaching in the midst of which I was brought up .

		Some of my friends have felt uneasy with that poem .

		It has sur - prised me very much that they should be .

		I am sure it came from my heart .

		I sometimes heard teachers that represented God as a tormentor .

		This wounded me I felt that I would not love the God who was thus depicted .

		It seemed to shut me up in a selfish love as though I must just love Him for what He gave me , or what I hoped that He would give .

		This did not satisfy me .

		I wanted to love Him for Himself .

		Charles
Kingsley	PERSON	told me how he passed through the same strug - gle , how he and his wife would he awake agonizing , because they could not love God , being what they imagined Him to be .

		Through a severe and paurful struggle I have learned to have larger hopes for the race than I once entertained .

		I do not think thatGod 's love for His creatui-es ever ceases , or that probation closes with the grave .

		This view seems to me the necessary conse - quence of our retaining our personality in the other life .

		Giod will not in the resurrection make us mere automata .

		We must have the exercise of free-will , the power of choice , or we cease to be ourselves .

		I sympatliise with the old divine who maintained that , if even the devil would repent , God would forgive him .

		But do not thiuk I wish to detract from the force of our Saviour 's ex - pressions .

		I accept them .

		I can see the possibility of eternal punishment .

		I believe it would be the inevitable result of eternal rebellion .

		The penalty must follow sin ; we see it in this life .

		I am thankful for the altered teaching of the present day .

		Friends have had their share in counteracting Calvinistic views . '

		These unstudied utterances well express the deeply religious faith which was so large a part of
Whittier	LOCATION	's nature , and are an interesting commentary on the notable poem to which they refer .

		No such action has been proposed to or taken by the

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Books that are hard to classify are nnmerons enough , heaven knows -LRB- or at any rate librarians know -RRB- , without the addition of literary hoaxes and other masked , disguised , hybrid , or nondescript products of the writer 's art .

		Among recent puzzlers of this sort to which the President of the
American Library Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion has called attention are '' ■ The Letters of a Chinese Official , '' `` As the Hague Ordains , '' and `` Indiscreet Letters from
Pekin	LOCATION	. ''

		To a cataloguer , at first glance , or even at second and third glance , these are all serious , trnth-telling books ; but to the intelligent reader , with more time to study them than the over-worked cata - loguer can command , they are nothing but fiction painted over with a more or less thick coating of plausibility and loeal color .

		The '' make-up '' of the ' Chmese Official '' was so deceptive as to move a certain eminent public man to write , and almost to publish , a serious rejoinder in the form of a solemn defense of Christianity and Western civilization ; but in the nick of time he learned diat the Chinaman was bom in
England	LOCATION	and had never worn a pigtaiL Books , too , that deal with inventions of the future or wars of the twenty - first centnry are a thorn in the cataloguer 's flesh .

Dewey	PERSON	and his decimal system , and laugh to scorn Mr.
Cutter	PERSON	and his ejcpansive classification .

		The decimal scheme should * have been made a duodecimal , or better a quin - qoedecimal or octodecimal one ; the expansive system would need a more than India-rubber elasticity to in - clude all the whimsical creations of an author 's brain .

		For a private reader , in the seclusion of his own study , to have been deceived by one of these masqueraders , is humiliating enough ; but for a professional cataloguer to have placed his gullibility on public record in a printed catalogue , or even in a card-catalogue , tends to lessen the joy of living .

		• • • The uteratctse of taxatiox , if tax bills and tax-collectors ' books can be called literature , contains some quaint and curious reading .

		Certain ancient documents belonging by inheritance to a
Boston	LOCATION	business man have been brought to light and made to show how taxes were assessed and collected in the latter part of the eighteenth century , when the metropolis of
Xew England	LOCATION	was still under town government .

		A tax bill of
1780	DATE	, made out against one
William Dodd	PERSON	, who owned no real estate , charges him with a tax on '' pei ^ sonal estate and faculty '' to the amount of 26Z , 17 `` , & d -- for town and coimty .

		His state tax on the same items was 12 / , 18 * , Ad .

		His state poll tax was twenty pounds sterling !

		And his town and county poll tax , forty pounds and ten shillings !

		!

		Total ,
1001	DATE	, a * , lOd .

		Yk the IhII is neither crumpled nor torn , nor does it other - wise display marks of indiguation or anger .

		The citizen of that day was required , in terms probably more amus - ing to us than to him , to state the number of ratable polls in his family , sixteen years old and upward to twenty-one years , and the number of polb of other and curious varieties ; the number of his dwelling-houses , shops , distilleries , sugar-houses , bake-houses , tan-booses , slaughter and other houses ; of his pot and peail-Mii works , iron works , furnaces , rope-walks , grist and full - ing mills , saw and slitting mills , and all other mills of whatever description ; also the number of ounces of silver plate in his possessicHi , the acreage of his araUe lands and of his orchards , his stock of wheat , rye , oats , barley , Indian com , peas , and beans , his acreage of fresh meadow and salt marsh and every other conceivable variety of land ; and so on to inconceivable length .

		Finally the climax was reached in a demand to know the number of his '' cow rights '' and how many barrels of `` cyder '' his whole estate yielded annually .

		We read little about tax-dodgers in those virtuous days , bnt the filling out of such a schedule as is here indicated must have tried the patience and tested the honesty of
William Dodd	PERSON	and his neighbors .

		• • • The particularttt or library statistics is becoming so minute as to impress the obi `` erver with the painstaking vigilance of librarians and asalstante .

		Sometimes , indeed , a gentle amusement is aroused by the ingenuity displayed in this department of library lore , and the outsider wonders what new task will next be imposed upon the indefatigable statistician .

		The public library of
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, has begun to keep count of the questions propounded in its reference room , and now announces a gain of
1156	DATE	such queries over laat year , the present year 's total falling little short of k myriad , without including inquiries for books , maps , and other publications kept in the room .

		Here , too , the contestants in 112 debates were furnished with ammunition for their argumentative encounters , and the department at all times has been crowded with infor - mation seekers from every walk of life .

		Useful appli - cations of , or fruitful deductions from , these as yet rath ^ dry statistics are to be hoped for some day .

		There is brought to mind , by the way , a certain library whose head conceived the idea of having his subordinates keep a re - cord of all books applied for unsueeessf ully , -- name of book and name of disi ^ pointed applicant to be in each case put down in black and white .

		Though such a record might have furnished an illustration , more impressive than
Johnson	PERSON	's poem , of the vanity of human wishes , to require it to be kept was asking too much of library - assistant human nature , and a curious chapter was thus lost to the literature of libnuy statisties .

		• • • Interestixg facts about younger sojre aijd daughters were brought to light in a paper read by Dr.
Louise G. Rabinovitch	PERSON	of
Xew York	LOCATION	before the late
International Congress	ORGANIZATION	on Psychiatry , at
Amsterdam	LOCATION	.

		After studying the hves of seventy - ^ our great men and women -- poets and prose - writers , politicians , painters , and musicians -- Dr.
Rabinovitch	PERSON	reports that only teo of the number were first-bom children , while a great majority of these seventy-four persons of genius were youngest or neit-to-the-youngest children .

		For instaiice ,
Coleridge	PERSON	was the last-bom of thirteen children ,
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	the eleventh of twelve children ,
Washington	LOCATION	Irving the youngest of eleven , Balzac the youngest of three ,
George Qiot	PERSON	the youngest of four .

		412 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Napoleon	PERSON	an eighth and probably youngest child ,
Daniel Webster	PERSON	the youngest of seven ,
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	the seventeenth child of his parents and the last-born chihl of the last-bom child for several generations back , Rembrandt the last of six , Rubens of seven ,
Landseer	PERSON	the fifth of seven children ,
Reynolds	PERSON	a seventh child ,
Weber	PERSON	a ninth ,
Wagner	PERSON	the yoimgest of seven ,
Mozart	PERSON	the same , Schubert the thirteenth of fourteen ,
Schumann	PERSON	the last-bom of five .

		The prominent part played here by the sacred seven is noticeable .

		Moreover , since maturity in the parents seems to be necessary for the production of children of geniiis , have we not here indicated a sphere of usefulness for L -RRB- r.
Osier	PERSON	's effete quadragenarians ?

		A reading of Dr.
Rabinovitch	PERSON	's list makes one wish he might have chosen , not so much his parents as the order of his birth ; but if all were to choose to be youngest sons or daughters , an obvious difficulty would present itself , comparable with that of the Irishman 's railway train which should insure condi - tions of safety by having no first or last cars attached .

		Statistics , however , let it be recalled in closing , can be made to pi-ove almost anything ; and it would doubtless be an easy matter to draw up a list of first-born men and women of genius -- which also would be interesting reading ...
John Harvard	PERSON	's benefaction seems to be held in rather slight esteem by at least one of the thousands of his livuig beneficiaries .

		Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	, a loyal son of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, shows the courage of his convictions in refusing to join the general chorus of praise .

		He is reported as saying , and with a good deal of reason when one calmly considers the matter , that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	'' has had Ids full share of posthumous honor for what was at best but a small contribution to the triumph of civiUzation , while other men who did more have been honored less , or , more politely speaking , have far sui-passed
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in the value of their counsels and donations . ''

		Harvard 's bequest of
# 700	MONEY	and liis library to the infant college came when the school was already established by legislative enactment and appro - priation , so that no founder 's honors are properly his ; nor does his gift impress the present generation by reason of its size .

		But it was timely ; and because the testator had the good fortiuie to die at the '' psycholog - ical moment '' in the struggling institution 's existence , he stepped into an imperishable renown .

		We live in an unjust world , and the prizes are never awarded with exaet equity ; but perhaps , in this instance , instead of seeking to honor
John Harvard	PERSON	less we might better strive to honor Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's '' other men '' more .

		The unveiling of Zola 's monument in
Paris	LOCATION	brings to light a pathetic incident that caused the death of its sculptor ,
Constantine Meunier	PERSON	, and that might well be made the theme of some powerful novel or drama or poem .

		Indeed , it is not inconceivable that Zola him - self might have treated it effectively .

		The celebrated Belgian sculptor , as we learn through his collaborator ,
M. Alexandre Charpentier	PERSON	, was devoted to his children .

		He had two sons , the older thirty years of age , the younger twenty-eight .

		One of them , of delicate con - stitution , had recently died , of tuberculosis ; the other , who had entered the army , was absent in
French Guiana	ORGANIZATION	.

		Only a few days after the death of the son at home the father received a long telegram announcing the sad fate of the other , who had died of a fever that commonly proves mortal to Europeans in tropical lands .

		Then followed a tragic experience for the father : for six weeks he kept receiving letters from the young captain who -- so sudden had been his end -- continued to the last de - scribing the life about him and giving animated ex - pression to his high hopes for the future .

		Under this refinement of torture , Memiier developed tendencies to heart-disease , and finally succumbed .

		In all this there is something of the grim horror of Greek tragedy .

		THE DIAL 413 9 ^ bt fleto ^ oohs .

		The Lefe Story of a True Americax .

		* It is the fashion of many in these days to draw gloomy pictures of the ruin that awaits the Republic at the hands of the European immigrant .

		Doubtless the steerage of every trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	liner brings in indi \ nduals des - tined to be of no material service , if not of positive injury , in the work of building up a self-governing people ; but at the worst it must be admitted that we can match from the native - bom product the most dangerous elements ever discovered in our importations from beyond the seas .

		There is a bright as well as a forbidding side to the subject , and it is well to consider once in a while some of the genuine contributions which the immigrant vessel has not infrequently made to the very highest tj-pes of the various phases of American citizenship .


Carl Schurz	PERSON	was too effective a fighter for any cause which appealed to his judgment and conscience to get through this world without making enemies and subjecting himself to harsh and partisan judgment , even at the hands of many well-meaning people .

		His entrance into the field of American politics came at a period when the habit of exaggerated partisanism had been fastened upon the country by the acerbities growing out of the .

		slavery question , and the effect of the Civil War was to maintain that habit among the masses , with but slightly dimin - ished force , throughout his life .

		But it was not in his nature to submit his own judgment and conscience to partisan leadership .

		Xo measiire whatever coiUd coimt on his support merely because it had the stamp of party approval , nor was his political thinking ever of that hazy type which tends to confuse party with country .

		Indeed , the first experiences of his budding manhood had taught him that country itself , in so far as country is identical with governmental organization , may go radically wrong , and that ideal citizenship must look still deeper for its ultimate standards .

		Of course a man who plants himself on a moral rock of that kind is '' impracticable ' '' to the average politician , who finds sand a more workable material than solid rock in more ways than one .

		And , sad to say , too many of us who have had experience enough to know better are always ready to accept the interested politician 's estimate when such a man comes into view .

		And yet with all the bitter • The Bbxi.viscescbs op Cam ,

		criticism which Mr.
Schurz	PERSON	's militant political ; independence has again and again called forth , there are few to-day who would seriously gainsay his title to a conspicuous place in the highest ranks of intelligent and patriotic American citizenship , during the fifty years of his partici - pation therein .

		The romantic siiory of his part in the abortive revolutionary movement of
1848	DATE	, his successful escape after defeat , and his daring penetration back into Prussian territory for the rescue from imprisonment of his old friend Professor
Kinkel	PERSON	, has been bandied about by the press so often that few have not met with its main facts gar - nished up in one style or another ; but no art of fiction could improve on his own detailed relation of the fact # , in the first of the two vol - umes before us .

		We shall attempt no epitome of a romance too good to be broken , and merely remark that nothing less than a courageous and unflagging advocate of personal and political liberty could grow out of such a youth as is here pictured .

		It was no mere chance that brought such a young man as
Schurz	ORGANIZATION	to
America	LOCATION	in the decade preceding our Civil War .

		He was bom for American citizenship , and nothing short of the most perverse interference with the eternal fit - ness of things could have kept him permanently out of this birthright .

		The revolutionary move - ments of
Europe	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	were premature , so far as anything more than a mere seed-sowing for an indefinite future was concerned ; but in
America	LOCATION	a struggle was in progress into which youthful idealism could throw its strength and enthusiasm with reasonable grounds for hope of early and substantial results .

		The funda - mental principles of liberty were already im - bedded in the
United States Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, and the question at issue was , in the last analysis , what to do with an institution radically at !

		variance with the essential character and the successful working of that document .

		German - American citizens were already numerous and influential in various parts of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but the `` Native American * ' movement , with various subsidiary causes , had led the majority of them to afiBliate with the Democratic party .

		Schurz I reached
America	LOCATION	in
1852	DATE	, and was fairly get - ting his bearings in the land of his adoption when the wreck of the Whig party cleared the i way for the formation of a new organization capable of considering the slavery question free from the trammel of past alliances and working i its way steadily towards a permanent solution , I in place of the shifty and unsatisfactory com - 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, promises with which the
Clays	ORGANIZATION	and
Websters	ORGANIZATION	and Calhouns of the immediately preceding era had sought to keep their constituents quiet .

		Naturally ,
Schurz	ORGANIZATION	threw in his lot with the new movement , and proved a very effective worker in detaching German voters of the
Northern States	LOCATION	from their former Democratic allegiance .

		It has always been recognized that the German element in
Missouri	LOCATION	was one of the most pow - erfid influences in holding that
State	ORGANIZATION	in the
Union	LOCATION	; and for the fact that this vote was so strongly massed on the right side when the crisis came , much credit is due to the efforts of Mr.
Schurz	PERSON	.

		By the year
1868	DATE	his effectiveness on the stump was so well recognized that he was invited into
Illinois	LOCATION	to take part in the great Lincoln-Douglas campaign , and here began the acquaintance which led Lincoln to so high an opinion of the young German 's character and ability that
three years later	DATE	he insisted upon sending him as Minister to
Spain	LOCATION	, in spite of his foreign birth , his record as an anti- monarchical revolutionist , his less than a decade of American citizenship , and the active opposi - tion of the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He himself asserts that the President would have been wise to heed such objection ; but he proved thoroughly efficient during the short time that he held the position , and Secretary
Seward	PERSON	declared himself well pleased with his services .

		As might have been expected , however , a life of comparative ease in
Madrid	LOCATION	could not satisfy his ideas of duty when once the country be - came involved in what was evidently to be a long and bloody struggle for existence .

		He took the first plausible opportunity to ask for permission to return to
Washington	LOCATION	on a fur - lough , and then persuaded the President to ac - cept his resignation from the diplomatic service and send him to the front .

		That his services as an officer in the army were intelligent , effective , and faithful in every way , will hardly be denied to-day by any unprejudiced reader of the evi - dence , though unfortunately the necessity in higher quarters of finding a scapegoat for the unfortunate blunders at ChanceUorsville long threw a whoUy undeserved reproach upon the
Eleventh Corps	ORGANIZATION	, to which his forces belonged .

		As a matter of fact .

		General
Schurz	PERSON	had dis - tinctly foreseen the danger of just such an attack as
Jackson	PERSON	actually made , hatl reported the movements of hostile troops directly in har - mony with his forecast , and had protested again and again that the
Eleventh Corps	ORGANIZATION	was in an absolutely fatal position if the apparently in - tended assault should come .

		But in spite of all this warning , the superior authority was capable of believing that
Jackson	PERSON	's forces were in fuU retreat , and of leaving the array in a position which would have been justifiable only if that unwarranted theory had been a demonstrated fact !

		The frank , dignified , and lucid presenta - tion of the whole case , with which the second volume of these reminiscences closes , leaves nothing to be desired , and is highly honorable to the mind and heart of the writer .

		It is a great misfortune that the story breaks off at so early a period in the author 's career .

		We are not told , in these volumes , whether he left materials for its continuation through the remaining forty years of his active life , but it may easily be conceived that the present might not be the most auspicuous time for the publi - cation of such materials , at least so far as they concern the imperialistic movement of the past decade .


Carl Schurz	PERSON	was emphatically an idealist , but never a mere doctrinaire .

		Holding unswervingly to the belief in personal and political liberty as the best means of social and political progress , he yet realized at a very early period in his career that liberty in itself is no cure-all for human troubles .

		It merely clears the way for possible improvement . ''

		The newly arrived European democrat , having lived in a world of theories and imaginings without having had any practical experience of a democracy at work , behold - ing it for the first time , asks himself : ' Is this really a people living in freedom ?

		Is this the realization of my ideal ? '

		He is puzzled and perplexed until it dawns upon him that in a condition of real freedom man mani - fests himself not as he ought to be b > it as he is , with all his bad as well as his good qualities , instincts and im - pulses ; with all his attributes of strength as well as his weaknesses : that this , therefore , is not an ideal state , but simply a state in which the forces of good have a free field as against the forces of evil , and in which the victories of virtue , of enlightenment , and of progress are not achieved by some power or agency outside of the people , for their benefit , but by the people themselves . ''

		Few men of his time appreciated order and efficiency in government more highly than did
Schurz	LOCATION	, as is amply proved by his vigorous and long continued battle for order and efficiency in the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	; but he realized that even such desirable qualities as these come at too high a price when imposed from without , at the sacrifice of freedom .

		Even a slow and comparatively disorderly approach to better things , through the stony path of experi - ence , is better than the firm hand which reaches down from above and removes disorder and responsibility at the same time .

		THE DIAL 415 '' What is sometimes called the Art of Self-go vermnent is not learned by masses of people theoretically , nor even bv the mere presentation of other people 's eiperi - eaees by way of instructive example .

		Practice is the only really effective teacher .

		Other methods of instruc - tion will rather retard , if not altogether prevent , the development of the self-governing capacity , because they wtII serve to weaken the sense of responsibility and self-reliance .

		This is the reason why there is not an instance in history of a people having been successfully taught to govern themselves by a tutelary power acting upon the principle that its wards should not be given the power of self-government until they had shown them - selves fit for it . ''

		He was perfectly willing to admit that self - government does not reach the highest possi - bility in point of a wise and economical administration of public affairs .

		We can easily conceive of a wise , just , benevolent , and unselfish despot capable under any given circumstances of controlling affairs more advantageously than the people , through any possible machinery of self-government , could manage them for them - selves .

		But with all its shortcomings in the work of administration , self-government is im - measurably superior as an educator . ''

		The foreign observer in
America	LOCATION	is at once struck by the fact that the average of intelligence , as that inteUigence manifests itself in the spirit of inquiry , in the interest taken in a g ^ reat variety of things , and in alertness of judgment , is much higher among the ma .

		`
Bifa	ORGANIZATION	here than anywhere else .

		This is certainly not owing to any superiority in the public school system in this country -- or , if such superiority exists , not to that alone -- but rather to the fact that here the individual is constantly brought into interested contact with a greater variety of things , and is admitted to active par - ticipation in the exercise of functions which in other countries are left to the care of a superior authority . ''

		We would gladly take up various other phases of this commendable and interesting career , and illustrate them by ample quotation , did space permit .

		The constant evidence of the author 's keen appreciation of the highest achievements in music , the drama , and other branches of artistic effort , can not fail to give pleasure to every cultivated reader .

Kachel	PERSON	's acting drew him again and again into the theatre , and the overwhelming impression which the mysterious power of the Alsatian Jewess made upon him is described in para - graphs hardlv less artistic and effective in their own way and for their own purpose than was
Rachel	PERSON	's acting in the field to which it belonged .

		Indeed , one of the notable things in the career of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	was the ease with which he acquired a mastery of English surpassed by very few even of the native-bom Americans of his time .

		With the externals of this work one might easily pick a few quarrels .

		There should have been some guide to its contents , such as a brief analytical paragraph at the head of each chapter .

		Again , either the proof-reading has been lament - ably careless in a considerable number of instances , or else bad editorial judgment has religiously followed mere slips of the pen in the original manuscript .


Carl Schurz	PERSON	himself was hardly likely to have had three ways of spelling the name of his friend Greneral Schimmelpf ennig , nor could he have forgotten that the running mate of General
Scott	PERSON	in the Presidential cam - paign in progress when he first landed on American shores was named
Graham	PERSON	, not
Gorhatn	PERSON	.

London	LOCATION	attire for a walk down Piccadilly -- a blue serge suit and a straw hat !

		Moreover , in this land of virulent malarial fever and pestilential diseases Mr.
Landor	PERSON	carried only the simplest remedies , such as carbolic soap , castor oil , caustic , and iodine .

		And the greatest of these was castor oil !

		-- his panacea for aU aches and ills , from incipient fever to the restoration of a man who was struck by lightning .

		To this disregard of the ordinary pre - cautions against accidents , the author ascribes his continuous health during his arduous jour - ney .

		But an important factor doubtless was his faith in the value of sunshine ; for , imlike many travellers in
Africa	LOCATION	, he seldom made night marches .

		But to whatever due , his splendid physical condition allowed him to use every moment of his time in energetic activity .

		Abyssinia and the
Emperor Menelik	PERSON	form the subject of some very interesting chapters of the book .

		The Emperor is , according to the author , an admirable man . ''

		He possesses an abnormal amount of sound sense .

		He is as just and fair to his coxmtry as is possible to an Emperor ; he is generous enough with what he possesses , and tries at all times to do what is right and proper .

		His simplicity and natural charm of manner are quite delightful . ''

		This charming Emperor certainly has a novel way of obtaining building material . ''

		If he wishes to put up another building , in the Palace for instance , or a church somewhere , he rides out upon his mule and picks up a stone or a piece of wood , which he carries back upon his shoulders to the Palace , or to the spot where the erection is to be made .

		The thousands of soldiers who always follow him nmst imitate his example , so that by the evening plenty of building material is already at hand . ''

		Many curious customs of the Abyssinians are recounted , and although they are but semi - civilized -- a state in which they are not long to be allowed to remain -- they appeal to us for one marked trait revealed in the following comment : '' There is one great thing in
Abyssinia	LOCATION	-- goods travel in absolute safety , when not accompanied by a military escort .

		Caravans can travel from one end of the country to the other , provided the necessary passes are carried , without fear of being robbed . ''

		To the west of Abyssinia the author met sev - eral tribes with jjecidiarly long legs .

		These Shiluk ,
Denka	LOCATION	, and Nuer people have such remarkably developed anatomical structures that the observer is led to believe that they have been especially built by Nature to live in marshy regions . ''

		Often one sees them along the river banks or in their villages , standing for long periods of time upon one leg , not unlike flamingoes , the other foot resting upon the knee of the extended leg . ''

		Among the Djur tribe , the iron-working indvistry has reached a relatively high degree of development .

		Notwithstanding their rudiment - ary tools , they smelt iron-ore and work the extracted metal with considerable success .

		Still farther west the author saw a `` hard-working factory of vermicelli . ''

		Of the much-disputed `` sleeping sickness , '' a sort of death-in-life disease , Mr.
Landor	PERSON	, as usual with him when discussing any controverted point , has a well-defined opinion .

		He believes that it is a disorder of the spinal vertebrae , '' producing severe effects mainly upon the cere - bellum , and , owing to the exhausted condition of the patient 's blood , causing the intense drowsiness and exhaustion from which the suf - ferers generally never wake up . ''

		The usually assigned cause of the disease , the tze-tze fly , is held innocent by our author .

		Very naturally , the explorer writes at some length on the conditions in the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		I think there could be no better proof that the natives are well treated by the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	than to see how neat and flourishing all the villages were , and how numerous was the population on the Belgian side in comparison with the other side , the French .

		K these people were so ill-treated as they are made out to be -LRB- only by people who have never been there -RRB- , I do not believe for one moment that they would remain where they are .

		All they would have to do would be to cross the river and go over to the French side ... Nothing could be simpler .

		Far from it , the inclination is just the other way .

		The people from the French side go over to the Belgian side in far greater numbers than those of the Belgian to the French .

		They find they can do better business and live just as happy in the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	, where roads were constantly being cut by the Belgians , and the coimtry was fast being improved . ''

		In regard to the indictment against the Bel - gian
Government	ORGANIZATION	concerning the mutilation of natives , our author dismisses the whole horrible business with the assertion that photographs of hundreds of mutilated individuals , mutilated by their own people , can be taken in any part of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		In the country aroimd
Fort Archambault	LOCATION	the custom of elongating the lips of the women , to enhance their beauty , was more pronounced than in any other part of
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		It was most ludicrous to hear these young ladies talk , especially when they had two plates , one in the upper and one in the lower lip , as these clapped like castanets , and the voice became nasal and unmusical ... The plates in the hps were occasionally removed , when the upper lip hung down so low in a loop as to reach lower than the chin , and left a repulsive aperture under the nose through which one could see the teeth .

		THE DIAI .

		417 From the r ^ on of the
Ubanghi River	LOCATION	the explorer journeyed to
Lake Tchad	LOCATION	, in order to study the mooted geographical problems about that lake ; thence he travelled in a wide semi - circle northward and eastward in
Kanem	LOCATION	, to visit some of the fanatical tribes on the border of the
Borku	PERSON	and the
Sinussi	PERSON	region , and to study the fanatical
Musselman	PERSON	movement against the white people .

		This movement imdoubtedly orig - inated among the Marabu -LRB- priests -RRB- . ''

		These people , '' says Mr.
Landor	PERSON	, `` at best a most un - scrupidous lot , are blowing the fire with all their might , and the time will come when they will feel strong enough and will make a firm stand against Christianity . ''

		Superstition , which is rampant among the people , is carefully nursed by the priests . ''

		The Sultan of
Zinder	PERSON	himself tells a story , in all seriousness , of a -RSB- ^ Iarabu being transformed into a lion under his own -LRB- the Sultan 's -RRB- eyes .

		In order to be able to accom - plish a similar feat of transmigration , the Sultan had been smearing himself with powder for three consecutive months . '

		In the Nigerian region was met one of the most interesting people described in the book .

		The Tuaregs .

		according to the author , are re - specters of women .

		Unlike those of other African tribes , the Tuareg women are quite free ; they go where they wish ; they take a leading part in the councils of the tribes ; they make war or peace between tribes , and often they are at the bottom of the raids upon passing caravans or upon weaker tribes .

		The men of the tribe fight their enemies in a manly way .

		They do not poison their spears or their arrows , and disdain to carry fire-arms , for with such modem imple - ments of warfare , say the Tuaregs , you can kill your enemy without being seen or running any danger to yourself .

		From
Lake Tchad	LOCATION	to
Timbuctu	ORGANIZATION	, a distance of about 1500 miles , the country is inhabited by the Tuaregs , the
Haussas	PERSON	, and the tribes of the
Niger Valley	LOCATION	.

		The author made a consid - erable visit at
Timbuctu	ORGANIZATION	, and writes an inter - esting account of this town with the melodious name .

		Here , as elsewhere in
Africa	LOCATION	, Mr.
Landor	PERSON	found much to commend in slavery -- not as a theory , but as a condition beneficent to the slave .

		We can readily agree vs-ith our author , in view - ing the pictures presentetl in the book , that the varieties of head-dress worn in
Timbuctu	LOCATION	are most remarkable .

		Mr.
Landor	PERSON	's opinion of
Africa	LOCATION	, at least that part of
Africa	LOCATION	through which he travelled , is indicated in the following passage . ''

		People in
Europe	LOCATION	hare a most erroneous idea that all conntries in
Africa	LOCATION	must be highly picturesque ; but , indeed , there is no continent in the world where an3rthing is more difficult to find than is picturesqueness among the people , scenery , or buildings , in the zone of
Africa	LOCATION	I travelled .

		There is no attractive colour to speak of in the landscape , the light being too brilliantly diffused in the middle of the day , and the contrasts too hard and violent in the morning and evening .

		As for the people , they are ungraceful and ugly , and wrapped In clnmsy clothing , usually white or brown ...
Central Africa	LOCATION	has a depressing effect .

		One never sees or hears any - body enjoy life thoroughly .

		All moan , sulk , and look or feel nasty about everything . ''

		Mr.
Landor	PERSON	's book has none of the usual characteristics which we associate with African travellers ' tales .

		There are few exciting adven - tures with animals , and the most momentous accident which seems to have happened to the author was to cut his hand while opening a tin can .

		But Mr.
Landor	PERSON	did not go to
Africa	LOCATION	to find adventures , and his trans-African journey was planned in such an unpretentious manner and carried out in such a thoroughgoing busi - ness-like way that we can not hold him account - able for not realizing our youthful expectations of direful accidents by field and flood .

		He is far more concerned with the characteristic fea - tures of that countrj ' than we have even inti - mated in this review .

		The rivers , mountains , elevations and deserts , the flora and fatma , the various complicated tribal divisions and names , the languages and customs of the tribes , and the host of details which of necessity must con - stitute the study of the observing traveller , are the objects which appeal to him .

		It should be added that the volumes are splendidly printed and handsomely and profusely illustrated .

		H. E. COBLEXTZ .

		Reading new books instead of old is not a thing that it is usually thought necessary to urge upon present - day readers ; but Mr.
Richard Whiteing	PERSON	, of '' No. 5
John Street	PERSON	, '' has taken the trouble to advise this practice , forestalling objections by adding that '' for every age the chief business is to reset the problems and principles of the past in terms of the present .

		You need never , therefore , fear you would miss anything of first im - portance . ''

		But how are we to know surely and at first hand what were the problems and principles of the past I without studying the records of that past ?

		A conspic - uous instance of what Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	regards as undue attention paid to antiquity he finds in the monumental
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' Modern '' History , which begins its multi - voluminous treatment of modem events with the year
1492	DATE	. ''

		You may imagine at this rate , '' he says , '' what chance Methuselah himself would have to catch up , say , with our first Reform Bill . ''

		All this would be more convincing if urged , not by a writer of modem books , but by one of the ancients , as by
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, for example , or
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, or
Terence	PERSON	, or Tacitus .

		Can not the
Psychic Researchers	ORGANIZATION	obtain for us the views of these gentlemen on this interesting question ?

		418 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's Various Ways .

		* There are so few stories among the new nature books that they may seem on the whole rather inferior in interest to those of other seasons .

		But in range of subject at least they are unusual , and among them are several books quite out of the ordinary .

		The eyes of nature - lovers will brighten at sight of the new volume by
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, which he calls '' The
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- ligence of the Flowers , '' and intends in some sort as a complement to the essay on bees .

		The title suggests such endless adaptations of root , stem , and leaf , as well as blossom , that disap - pointment awaits the reader unless heed is given to the author 's warning that he wishes '' merely to recall a few facts known tfl every botanist , '' and has `` no intention of reviewing all the proofs of intelligence which the plants give us . ''

		He confines himself almost entirely to the delicate arrangements for cross-fertilization , de - scribing them with as great scientific accuracy as if he were not a poet .

		But the charm of the book lies nevertheless in the fact that he is a poet .

		Life is to him a great inclusive mystery in which flowers have a share comparable to that of human beings . ''

		It would really seem as though ideas came to the flowers in the same way as to us .

		The flowers grope in the same darkness , encounter the same obstacles , the same iU-will , in the same unknown .

		They have the same laws , the same disillusions , the same slow and difficult triumphs . ''

		The book-making is daintily done , though one longs for drawings of lilies and orchids in place of the photographs of conventional gardens .

		If flowers have intelligence , animals must have morals .

		At least the reader is tempted to make that logical connection between
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's book and Mr.
Thompson Seton	PERSON	's '' Natural History of the Ten Commandments , '' which attempts to show that animal tribes have • The Intelligence of the Flowers .

		Cin - cinnati :
Jennings & Graham	ORGANIZATION	, flourished in proportion as they have approxi - mated obedience to the decalogue . ''

		Years ago , '' says the author , '' I set for my theory that : The Ten Commandments are not arbitrary laws given to man , but are fundamental laws of all highly developed animals . ''

		^ The novelty of this theory makes the essay , which is little more than a pamphlet in bulk and binding , the most original writing of the group under discussion .

		Scoff as the reader may at the beginning , he is likely in the end to consider the idea a possible argument for moral evolution .

		Mr.
Seton	PERSON	evi - dently believes in separating business and pleas - ure , for though he outlines a few stories to prove his points , he does not allow himself to elaborate them enough to interfere with the seriousness of his purpose .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	's new volume , '' Whose Home is the Wilderness , '' on the contrary , is a story - book pui-e and simple .

		To our surprise , the author appears in its pages gun in hand .

		But he usually manages to turn his shooting into a joke , and to tell entertainingly how his interest in his intended victim overcame his desire for meat .

		The title of one chapter , '' Wild Folk One by One , '' expresses the underlying idea of the stories , which is that each animal has its own individuality , and that this is much more marked among the wild than among the domesticated species .

		Two of the stories , ' * A Sable Hero '' and '' Himself , '' will hold their own with the best Mr.
Long	PERSON	has written .

		The first relates how a crow , bent on giving the alarm-call to a flock of birds , deliberately faces the gun which has just shot down his mate , and how the gunner feels '' that a man must not shoot a bird like that '' ; the second is dedicated to the white - throated sparrow , and comes as near as one would think possible to putting into words the author 's feeling for his kindred of the wild .

		That we need to reform some of our ideas is several times indicated -- as in this instance : '' To imderstand a wild goose two things are neces - sary , luck and a good disposition ; luck to find him at home , and a disposition to lay aside your gun and your prejudices and to see with an open mind .

		If happily these two pleasant things have ever fallen to your lot , you no longer call a person a goose unless you mean to pay him a compliment and you no longer speak of a wild goose chase as a symbol of a useless and hopeless quest ; for among all the birds there is none that so readily responds to your advances , and none that so abimdantly repays you for yoiu ' time and trouble . ''

		In make-up the book corresponds to previous volumes from the same pen , except that the mar - ginal drawings are more varied .

		The two bird books of the present group are of very different chai-acter .

		Mr.
Rich	PERSON	's
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 419 '' Feathered Game of the Northeast '' is a sportsman 's book in the sense of giving elab - orate and accurate descriptions of game birds , and not in the sense of giving lengthy admoni - tions about shooting .

		Aside from an emphatic plea for obedience to game laws and moderation in killing , the author for the most part leaves methods to be inferred .

		His descriptions are so good that enjoyment of them need not be con - fined to sportsmen , while the numerous full-page drawings will help bird-lovers to identify closely related species of plover , duck , grouse , etc. .

		To most readers Mr.
Finleys	PERSON	hunting will seem even more satisfactory , for it was done only with the camera .

		The attractive title '' Americ ^ an Birds Photographed and Studied from Life '' ' gives only a slight idea of the attractiveness of the text .

		One is tempted to dare a superlative and call this.the most delight - ful bird book that has been written .

		It con - fessedly does not cover the entire field , but it has something new to say of the commonest birds , and many uiiimagined things about rarer species such as yellow-throats , weavers , warbling vireos , and eagles .

		The ingenuity which was required to place the camera for some of the pictures -- that , for instance , of the eagle 's nest one hundred and twenty feet from the ground -- would give interest to the pictures even if they were not fascinating for their own sakes .

		An individual bird or family is studied in each case , and the author makes them so human that we half repent of spying upon their secrets .

		To us , the end justifies the means ; but we should like to know how the birds felt about it .

		In several instances even this is made known , as when Mr.
Finley	PERSON	cut out the wood at the back of a chickadee 's nest and took a snap-shot of the sitt ` mg mother-bird who bravely kept her place .

		This is what happened next : '' I knew she had done a heroic de `` d. I sat down under the tree to watch .

		As soon as all was qoiet she shot from the door like a winged bullet and struck right on the limb beside her mate who had been dee-dee-ing to her all the rime .

		Of course , birds do not feel as we feel , but I do n't believe a sweetheart ever met her lover returning from a field of battle with a greater show of joy .

		They simply threw themselves into each other 's arms .

		It was n't a silent meeting either ; there were real cracks of kisses and twitters of praise .

		Chickadees are not human by any means , but had she not defended her home all alone against a giant ? ''

		After alL the outdoor life is not entirely for the animals , and two good books on campLag remind us that man may share it if he will .

		The first is a reprint of articles by Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	which have appeared in the magazines , recount - ing his trip to the Yellowstone with President
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and a visit to
Sagamore Hill	LOCATION	.

		The friendship between the two men is ideal , and ad - mirers of both will be glad to have these records of it in available shape .

		These '' prominent citizens '' disport themselves on a vacation like boys on a holiday , and one would ask nothing better than to have seen them as they ran from camp coatless and hatless to see the mountain sheep descend a precipice , or raced each other down the hills on their skis .

		The book is plainly bound , but has some excellent photographs .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's `` Camp and Trail '' is not an account of journeys , but a book of directions for those who intend to go camping and tramping in the
West	LOCATION	.

		So far as one who has not had experience can judge , the advice about clothes , food , tents , cooking utensils , etc. , is thoroughly sensible .

		Certainly with the drawings , and even the names of firms that furnish the desirable articles , the way of it all is as ' * plain as plum porridge , '' so that the westward-faring man , though a tenderfoot , can not err therein .

		A book about gardens does not necessarily belong with nature books , since a garden is the place where art and nature meet .

		But it is pleas - ant to find in the present collection as enjoyable a volume as Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	's ''
Eversley Crardens	PERSON	and Others . ''

		To be sure , the volume is in one way an encourager of envy , for the reader can only hear about the garden and look at the pic - tures of it , while the writer not only has the garden but has had the joy of making it .

		But if the reader does not receive his share of the pleasure it is his own faidt .

		Even the long list of plant-names can be made as impressive as the Catalogue of the Ships if they are read in the right spirit .

		For practical purposes the book will have little value for Americans , since the English climate is so much kinder to roses and other things .

		But anyone who is enthusiastic about flowers will enjoy the combination of good sense and artistic feeling with which Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	presents the whole process of gardening , from the dme when the soil is turned '' moist and blue on one side where the spade presses , softly lilac and chocolate where it breaks and crumbles , '' to the time when the cut flowers stand in the vase -- '' which should always form a harmonious whole with them . '

		`` God 's Calendar , '' by Mr.
William Quayle	PERSON	, sums up in a general way much that has been said in detaU in the other volumes .

		Having read of the individual bird , beast , and blossom , we may read here of the individual month , and what it accomplishes in the world . ''

		Twelve comings and goings of the moon , with a few days excess 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, thrown in for good measure , as is customary with God ; and God 's Calendar is an accomplished loveliness . ''

		Each month is celebrated some - what briefly , but with rather a sure sense of its peculiar quality , and the word-pictures are en - forced with delicate photogravures . ''


January	DATE	is winter at noon .

		Weather cuts up now if at all .

		The sense of mastery , cold , cruel , relentless , is in winter 's heart ...
March	DATE	is the feast of trumpets of the year .

		It is the wind month .

		Jehu 's driving was a jog trot compared with the speed of the
March	DATE	winds .

		...
June	DATE	for the wild rose blooming !

		June never wears at her throat other than a wild rose flower .

		Nor could a colorist like Titian conjure up a tint more enticing . ''

		But it is obviously unfair to quote disjointedly .

		The tone of the book is distinctly rapturous , but it will find many appreciators .

		One would sur - mise that it will be especially popular with the older generation of readers , who have not been sated with nature books , and who will like it for expressing feelings which they have never quite dared to voice for themselves .

		her disposal , the author reproduces no little of '' the charm of that wonderful century , '' as she calls it ^ the charm of romance and color and joyous life .

		As Sainte-Beuve has said , the letters cover '' twenty-seven years of the most delightful period of the most agreeable French society '' ; and of course these letters are the most valuable of all extant material to a biog - rapher of their writer .

		Yet they have not been drawn upon imduly in this work ; familiarity will never breed weariness of their piquant charms .

		Who does not enjoy having the page before him brightened up with a vivid touch like the following ?

		The mother is referring to a Provencal gentleman described by her daughter . ''

		I have seen sleeves like those of your chevalier , '' she writes . ''

		Ah !

		what a charming picture they make , dancing in a plate of soup , or sweeping over a salad bowl !

		But though they draw everything with them , I ques - tion whether they would draw me ; in spite of my weakness for fashion , I have a great aversion to slovenliness . '

		Portraits in abundance , and views of three houses once lived in by
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	, adorn the volume ; but the personal attractiveness of the lively and witty
Marquise	PERSON	, as delineated by the pens of her admirers , appears to have been less successfidly repro - duced by the artist 's brush .

		Miss
Aldis	PERSON	, quot - ing the malevolent
Bussy de Rabutin	ORGANIZATION	, speaks of the pupils of her eyes as being of different colors -- using the word `` pupil '' where she evidently means '' iris . ''

		Her fidelity , in gen - eral , to her authorities deserves praise ; she does not , like some of her sex who have essayed biography , vaidt from the spring-board of her imagination high over the actual facts .

		It was but a short while ago that the name of the
Empress Eugenie	PERSON	, who now seldom emerges from the retirement of her Hampshire home , came into some prominence by reason of her alleged promotion of the Hispano-English royal marriage , she being godmother of the bride and feeling a deep interest in both bride and groom .

		Thus the present life of her , entitled '' The Last Empress of the French , '' by Mr.
Philip W. Sergeant	PERSON	, comes not inopportunely from the press .

		Agreeably written , clearly printed , and handsomely illustrated , the book is worthy of its subject .

		It shows , too , care and painstaking research in its preparation ; but one might have expected that the restraint imposed upon the biogTapher by the
Empress Eugenie	ORGANIZATION	's being still alive woidd have been off - set by the advantage of some little help from her in the clearing up of certain obscurities in her

		THE DIAL .

		421 evoitful history .

		No traces of such timely aid , however , are manifest ; and the curious world is still left in darkness concerning some of the more important details of her acquaintance and marriage with
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		Not even when and where she first met him are we yet to know .

		However , swallowing our disappointment as best we can , we turn the pages and hit upon many passages of a very real and human interest .

		The famous '' Mondays '' at the Tuileries , with charades or tableaux under the supervision of Merimee or Viollet-le-Duc , or with romping games that somewhat scandalized those of stiff and stately habit , are pleasantly noticed , with other incidents of court life .

		On the whole , one is left with the impression of a beautiful and lovable character , after following the fortunes of the polynomial Spanish grandee 's charming daughter from her birth in the city of
Granada	LOCATION	to her widowed and childless retirement at Famborough Hill .

		Studying once more the enigmatic genius of her imperial spouse , one can well agree with ^ Ir .

		Sergeant in his assertion that ' • history 's final verdict upon
Napoleon HI	ORGANIZATION	.

		has yet to be heard . ''

		and that '' perhaps no final and satisfactory verdict can ever be given . ''

		A late decision in the
Evans	PERSON	will case may remind some newspaper readers of the famous and wealthy American dentist 's part in effecting the
Empress Eugenie	ORGANIZATION	's escape from
Paris	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	in the war-distracted
summer of 1870	DATE	.

		This rather exciting story , drawn chiefly from the
Evans Memoirs	ORGANIZATION	, is again fully narrated .

		Other equally good things in the book must be left tmnoticed in so brief a review .

		Of a different character from the preceding , thou ^ on the same general subject , is the '' Court Life of the Second French Empire . ''

		detailing `` its organization , chief personages , splendour , frivolity , and downfall . ''

		Thewriter 's gathering together of a great amount of history and myth , gossip and scandal , joke and anec - dote , is a performance of which he is either so little proud , or from claiming the credit of which he so modestly shrinks , that the authorship is ascribed to '' Le Petit Homme Rouge '' -- the Little Red Man who is supposed to have haunted the Palace of the Tuileries and other residences of the French court , and to have his qtiarters now , under a republican rule , in the
Elysee Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Li the more abundant leisure enjoyed by this gossipy ghost in these less superstitious , less credulous times , he has taken to recording his memories of the past : and hence we are treated to the present good-sized volume of miscellanies -- history , biography , and scandal - ography -LRB- for it unblushingly professes to give some of the worst court scandals current -RRB- .

		We said ' • imblushingly , '' and said so advisedly , because the Little Red Plan 's complexion must make it impossible for him to blush ; he leaves that to his readers .

		Among the many items of innocent interest with which his pages are also sprinkled may be mentioned the account of the luxury indulged in by the imperial household , wlule the Empire , all unsuspected by the pam - pered inmates of the Tuileries , was tottering to its
fall	DATE	.

		His stable alone , with its three or four hundred horses and its scores of attendant menials , cost
Napoleon HI	ORGANIZATION	.

		nearly
two million francs	MONEY	a year .

		A matter of considerable imcer - tainty referred to in the foregoing paragraph is confidently cleared up by the Little Red Man , who asserts that the first time
Eugenie de Montijo	PERSON	saw her future husband '' was after the
Strasburg	PERSON	aSsat in
1836	DATE	, when , being in
Paris	LOCATION	, they -LSB- she and her mother -RSB- happened to call at the
Prefecture of Police	ORGANIZATION	to see the Prefect 's wife , Mme.
Delessert	PERSON	, a Spaniard by birth and a family friend , on which occasion they saw the Prince passing in the custody of several police - men . ''

		The book furnishes entertainment and amusement , which is probably its prime purpose .

		A '' Life of Louis XI . ''

		can not but call instantly and pleasantiy to mind that `` delicious
summer	DATE
morning	TIME	, before the sun had assumed its scorching power , and while the dews yet cooled and perfumed the air , '' when a youth in short gray cloak and smart blue bonnet adorned with a single sprig of holly and an eagle 's feather came walking with springing step from the north-east and made his way across a wide brot ^ tributary to the Cher , toward the royal castie of Plessis-les-Tours .

		The kingly occupant of tihat castie turns out , upon historical inquiry , to be far different from the inhtmianly cold and calcu - lating and cruel villain of ''
Qnentin Durward	PERSON	. ''

		His latest biographer , Mr.
Christopher Hare	PERSON	, appears to be the first to have nuide use of the nine large volumes of
Louis	LOCATION	's '' lettres missives '' and '' pieces justificatives '' which have just been published under the auspices of the
Societe de THistoire de France	ORGANIZATION	.

		A remark of the Abbe Le Grand quoted by ^ ir .

		Hare helps to explain why this able and in many respects estimable ruler has hitherto ` been the victim of a '' concert of maledictions . ''

		The Abbe sajrs : • ' As it was needful for
Louis XI.	LOCATION	, in order to establish law and order in the kingdom , to punish various great lords , even princes of the blood , such as the dukes of Alen ^ on and Bourbon -- the
King	LOCATION	being also the persistent enemy of the great 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
House	ORGANIZATION	of Burgiuidy -- and as all these lords and princes had chroniclers in their jjay , we can not wonder that the
King of France	ORGANIZATION	received from them the character of a sanguinary tyrant . ''

		The occasional scraps of fifteenth-century French that the author has interspersed give a quaintly realistic touch to his picture of feudal
France	LOCATION	.

		This '' most difficult period of history '' presents a network of tangled politics and a snarl of interminable feuds ; and the patience and skill with which Mr.
Hare	PERSON	has threaded his way through it all deserves praise .

		Portraits , maps , chi'onological table , bibliography , and index are duly provided .

		The gossipy pen of the
Comtesse de Boigne	ORGANIZATION	by no means ceased from its pleasant labors with the year
1814	DATE	, which closed her first vol - ume of '' Memoirs '' as edited by
M. Charles Nicoullaud	PERSON	and ah-eady reviewed in these pages .

		A second instalment covering the years
1815	DATE	-
1819	DATE	is now published , uniform with its prede - cessor and giving promise -LRB- though unexpressed -RRB- of more still to follow ; for the writing appears to have been done about the year
1835	DATE	-- which , at the leisurely pace of the chapters already printed , would provide matter for three or four additional volumes .

		The four years now passed in review seem to have been spent by the writer with her parents , first at
Turin	LOCATION	, where her father was settled a short time as French Ambassador ; then in
London	LOCATION	, whither he was transferred in the same capacity ; and finally in
Paris	LOCATION	, which became his home once more upon his retirement from the diplomatic service .

		The unloved and imloving husband ,
M. de Boigne	PERSON	, is mentioned but three times in the whole volume .

		The
Comtesse	ORGANIZATION	's experience of the life diplomatic moved her at its close to write : `` I have seen the diplomatic career under the pleasantest con - ditions -- when my father occupied an embassy of first importance , enjoyed the complete con - fidence of his own Government , and was in high favour with the
London	LOCATION	authorities -- neverthe - less I emphatically repeat that it is one of the least agreeable that a man can pursue . ''

		Among the more important events touched upon by the writer are
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's return from
Elba	PERSON	, his defeat at
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and the restoration of Louis XVIII .

		She thinks that '' possibly if he -LSB-
Napoleon	PERSON	-RSB- had found among his former civil servants the same enthusiasm which inspired the military , he would have been better able to accomplish the gigantic task which lay before him ■ ' ; but `` his instinct for government imme - diately understood that these people represented public feeling much more than the soldiers . ''

		A significant footnote is a letter from Rainulphe d'Osmond , the
Comtesse	ORGANIZATION	's brother , to his father , in which he narrates an occurrence that is also described in the page above ; and as the brother 's letter is obviously the sister 's source of informa - tion , a little comparison of the two accounts shows the readier that in this instance , and pre - sumably in others , the entertaining author is wont to clothe the baldness of fact in the embroidery of fancy .

		Much , therefore , that she records is to be taken with reservations .

		Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	's '' George Sand and her Lovers '' is written in a spirit of protest and revolt .

		To him English reserve in affairs of the heart and English intolerance of illicit love are nothing but ridiculous prudery -- an exhibition of men and women '' capable of better things grovelling at the feet of bourgeois conventions . ''

		This is perhaps an extreme representation of his attitude , and the quotation is wrested somewhat violently from its context ; but it is plain that his sympathies in the matter are on the further side of the Englisli Channel .

		Convinced that previous biogi-aphies of the gi-eat Frenchwoman have slighted an interesting side of her character , he attempts to make good their shortcomings -- to fill out their reticences -- by detailing , from a great mass of extant letters to and from
George Sand	PERSON	, the particulars of her successive passions .

		Contrasting the examples of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	and
George Sand	PERSON	, very much -LRB- as he evidently thinks -RRB- to the latter 's advantage , he declares that whereas in
England	LOCATION	romance is degraded to tlie level of intrigue -- or so it seems to the French -- in
France	LOCATION	the endeavor is to raise intrigue to the dignity of romance ; and the best instance of such laudable endeavor is furnished by the sub ^ ject of his volume . ''

		Living in an extravagant age , '' he says , '' she gloried in her own contri - butions to its extravagance .

		She not only ' lived her own life ' but boldly asserted her right to do so .

		Her feeling apparently was that , when she loved , she was making history ; and she took pains that the future historian should not find the records incomplete .

		Not only did she most carefully preserve such records of her amours as her own and
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	's letters , and leave directions that they should be published after her death : she also chronicled them from day to day -- almost from hour to hour -- in her letters to various friends . ''

		Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	s previous achievement in '' Madame de Stael and her Lovers ' ought to have qualified him for a similar study of George Sand ; and those inter - ested in this branch of literature will probably not be disappointed in this volume .

Douglas Sladen	PERSON	writes about the sights of the
Vatican Palace	ORGANIZATION	which are not generally accessible to the public and of the routine of life , official and personal , that centres in those hidden portions of the palace .

		The history of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, its gradual construction and decoration , its libraries , private chapels , and
Borgia	ORGANIZATION	apartments on the one hand , and on the other the elaborate machinery of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	hierarchy , -- the cere - monies that accompany the death and election of a Pope and the creation of a cardinal , the duties of the
Papal Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Cardinal Nephew	ORGANIZATION	, the simple every-day life of the Pope , the Papal andiences .

		the functions of the
Papal Court	ORGANIZATION	and the Sacred Congregations , -- these are the topics of which Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	writes .
