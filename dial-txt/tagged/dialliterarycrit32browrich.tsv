		BRIEFER MENTION 25 NOTES 26 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 27 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 27 A LINK W ITH THE PAST .

		The transmission of intellectual traits from generation to generation is a subject that has engaged the attention of many writers .

		The researches in this field of Mr.
Francis Galton	PERSON	, for example , are widely known , and , while they can not be said to have formulated anything like a psychological law of intellectual heredity , they have contributed many side-lights to the illumination of the subject .

		There are probably no better illustrations of this kind of inheritance than are afforded by the annals of New En - gland .

		There are many cases in which intel - lectual leadership became a family tradition , and in which inherited distinction carried with it , as the most sacred of obligations , the man - date to keep the torch alight .

		Since for over two centuries the best thought of
New England	LOCATION	was devoted to religious ends , the most con - spicuous examples of our intellectual aristocracy are to be found in the ranks of the clergy ; although , in later generations , education , states - manship , and even literature proved to be suitable channels for the diversion of energies which , in their ancestral manifestations , had mainly served the purpose of the Puritan the - ology .

		It would be deeply interesting to collect the cases in which the minister 's calling de - scended , from father to son , through four , five , six , or even more generations ; it would be deeply interesting , also , to inquire into the number of cases in which the forceful intel - lects of our own time have sprung from roots first planted in the churches of
Colonial New England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The resulting exhibit would con - stitute a peerage of the sort unknown to
Burke	LOCATION	; it would exemplify that peerage of the intellect which alone deserves the respect of rational men .

		The family of the
Mathers	ORGANIZATION	, distinguished for four generations , is the example that will first occur to the great majority of persons whose attention is once directed to this subject .

		But other families are almost equally striking , and a moment 's reflection will add to the list the names of
Winthrop	LOCATION	,
Hale	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Dana	PERSON	,
Dwight	PERSON	, and
Adams	PERSON	.

		We doubt if the history of any European country , or of
England	LOCATION	itself , can make as remarkable a showing of the per - sistence of intellectual force as is made in the history of
New England	LOCATION	by the families already named , and the others that might be named with them .

		The ways of heredity are past finding out in the present state of our knowl - * edge , but it may fairly be said that descent from one of these famous stocks creates a rea - sonable presumption that the descendant will be found possessed of much more than the average mental vigor , and will be pretty likely to do something toward maintaining the tra - 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, dition of his ancestry .

		In such a descendant the manifestation may possibly take a perverted form , and will probably take a form that would have startled his Puritan forbears , could they have foreseen it ; but the transmitted strain will contrive to express itself in some fashion , al - though it may not be in such fashion as to attract widespread attention .

		We have been led to these reflections by news of the death , two days before
Christmas	DATE	, of
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	, the dean of American letters for a number of years past , and a distinguished member of a family quite as remarkable as those which have already been mentioned by name .

		For three generations , the Channings have been represented in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can literature .

		The name was first made famous by the great Unitarian divine ,
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	-LRB- 1780-1842 -RRB- .

		The foremost
Ameri	PERSON	- can theologian of his day , and one of the stoutest fighters against the evil of slavery , his influence as a thinker was felt all over the world , and his books were translated into many languages .

		His brother
Walter	PERSON	-LRB- 1786-1876 -RRB- was a physi - cian by calling , a professor at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and a writer of many kinds of books .

		A third brother ,
Edward Tyrrel	PERSON	-LRB- 1790-1856 -RRB- , was the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor of rhetoric and oratory to whom so many of our nineteenth century writers have paid their tribute of affectionate memory .

		In the second generation of Channings , we find
William Henry	PERSON	, the son of a fourth brother of the three named above , and distinguished as the Unitarian clergyman who succeeded Mar - tineau in his Liverpool pastorate .

		Then comes
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	, 2nd -LRB- 1818-1901 -RRB- , the son of
Walter	PERSON	, and the occasion of the present article .

		To this generation also belongs
William Francis	PERSON	, a distinguished physician and scientist , the son of the great divine .

		The third generation carries the family tradition for liter - ary distinction down to our own years , being now represented by Professor
Edward Channing	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, whose historical work is well known .

		He is the son of
William Ellery	PERSON	, and his cousin , Mrs.
Grace Ellery Channing	PERSON	-
Stetson	ORGANIZATION	, a poet of creditable achievement , is the daughter of
William Francis Channing	PERSON	.

		The second
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	, who ^ ied the other day at the age of eighty-three , had been a resident of
Concord	LOCATION	off and on for nearly sixty years .

		As the husband of a sister of
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, as the close associate of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and as one of the best-known American poets of half a century ago , his life linked the twentieth cen - tury with a past that now seems remote indeed , not so much for the years that separate us from it as for the changes that those years have brought in our national ideals .

		Although he broke the silence as recently as
1886	DATE	with a poem on
John Brown	PERSON	, his work was mainly done nearer fifty than fifteen years ago , and many who took note of his death the other day must have learned at the same time with no little surprise that he had lived on into the new century .

		How completely he belongs to the far distant past may be illustrated by the fact that it was nearly sixty years ago that
Poe	PERSON	con - tributed his contemptuous review of Channing to ''
Graham	PERSON	's Magazine , '' accusing him of ex - hibiting the vices of transcendentalism , and of having been '' inoculated with virus from Ten - nyson , '' or , in other words , of having '' adopted and exaggerated that noble poet 's characteris - tic defect , having mistaken it for his principal merit . ''

		Of the justice or injustice of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's charges the reader may be allowed to judge from the present reproduction of the '' Hymn of the
Earth	LOCATION	, '' one of Channing 's best and most typical poems . ''

		My highway is unfeatured air , My consorts are the sleepless Stars , And men my giant arms upbear , -- My arms unstained and free from scars . ''

		I rest forever on my way .

		Rolling around the happy Sun ; My children love the sunny day , But noon and night to me are one . ''

		The forests and the mountains high .

		No leaf may fall , no pebble roll .

		No drop of water lose the road ; The issues of the general Soul Are mirrored in its round abode . ''

		In this poem , the Emersonian influence is clearly distinguishable , but there seems to be no evidence of a Tennysonian inspiration .

		Something of the latter , however , may possibly be traced in the following stanza from another poem , which is also noteworthy for containing

		THE DIAL the one verse of Channing that has gained currency as a '' familiar quotation . ''

		`` I am not earth-born , though I here delay ; Hope 's child , I summon infiniter powers , And laugh to see the mild and sunny day Smile on the shrunk and thin autumnal hours ; I laugh , for hope hath happy place with me , -- If my bark sinks , 't is to another sea . ''

		The list of Channing 's writings includes the '' ' Poems '' of 1843-47 , and - the following vol - umes of verse : '' The Youth of the Painter , '' '' The Woodman , '' '' Near Home , '' '' The Wanderer , '' '' Eliot , '' and ``

		JOHN
BURROUGHS AS PROSE WRITER	ORGANIZATION	.

		As Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's tale of work is now very considerable , and is little likely to be materially increased , we may offer some notes of general ap - preciation of his theme and style .

		Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's true theme is bird-life .

		Never has lived a man more intimate with birds than he . ''

		A friend of mine , '' he says in '' Riverby , '' '' picks up Indian relics all about the fields ; he has Indian relics in his eye .

		I have seen him turn out of the path at right angles , as a dog will when he scents something , and walk straight away several rods , and pick up an Indian pounding-stone .

		He saw it out of the corner of his eye .

		I find that without conscious effort I see and hear birds with like ease .

		Eye and ear are always on the alert . ''

		The in - tensity of his devotion may sometimes lead him to exaggerate their likeness to humanity , as when he remarks : '' Birds show many more human traits than do quadrupeds .

		That they actually fall in love , admits of no doubt ; that there is a period of court - ship , during which the male uses all the arts he is capable of to win his mate , is equally certain ; that there are jealousies and rivalries , and that the peace of families is often rudely disturbed by outside males or females , is a common observation . ''

		But I have myself seen an English hen-sparrow holding a cock by the top-knot , and dangle him clear off his feet while her friends punished him with violent peckings .

		The charm in bird-life is that they live , unlike us , in all three dimensions ; at least , they go up and down by no such clumsy contrivances as stairs or elevators .

		Haunting realms as yet unconquered by man , they bewitch us with their grace ; but clip their wings , and their poetry vanishes .

		Not the ostrich , but the eagle , fires the imagination .

		The flight of birds does not receive as much attention from Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	as it might ; although he is conversant with all their melodies , and his very best writing is on this theme .

		But are not birds singers because they are flyers ?

		Quickly and often hid from mates and companions , they acquire the far - reaching fetching calls which are musical notes .

		Hence the sweetest singers are not the large birds , or sea birds , or prairie birds , but small birds of the dense forest , as thrushes , warblers , and vireos .

		Next to birds , Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	is most felicitous in characterizing rustic life , animal and human , and general aspects of nature , seasonal and diurnal .

		Mark this fine sketch of
March	DATE	weather : '' This was a typical
March day	DATE	, clear , dry , hard , and windy , the river rumpled and crumpled , the sky in - tense , distant objects strangely near ; a day full of strong light , unusual ; an extraordinary lightness and clearness all around the horizon , as if there were a diurnal aurora streaming up and burning through the sunlight ; smoke from the first
spring	DATE	fires rising up in various directions ; a day that winnowed the air , and left no film in the sky .

		At night how the big
March	DATE	bellows did work !

		... The stars all seemed brighter than usual , as if the wind blew them up like burning coals .

		Venus actually seemed to flare in the wind . ''

		At its best , the style of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	is emi - nently clear , simple , and forcible .

		It disdains mere polish and urbanity , but it has a pleasant rustic tartness .

		The quiet , peace , and mildness of the countryside envelope and pervade ; the simplicity and rurality of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	and Seneca prevail .

		High distinction , power , passion , imagination , are lack - ing ; but we find much hard Yankee shrewdness and common-sense .

		His muse is pedestrian , and often trudges ; yet his absolute genuineness , honesty , and modesty are so refreshing and engaging that we are charmed .

		I believe that Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	conceives himself of an order diverse from
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and critics gen - erally distinguish them ; but my impression is that he affiliates more closely with
Thoreau	PERSON	than with any other author .

		While Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	has not the mordant genius , or the stern ever-haunting idealism , er the craftmanship of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, still he often writes in
Thoreau	LOCATION	's vein ; but a single passage in illustration must suffice .

		`` < One
spring	DATE	morning five swans flew above my barn in single file , going northward -- an express train bound for Labrador .

		It was a more exhilarating sight than if I had seen them in their native haunts .

		Tbey made a breeze in my mind , like a noble passage in a poem .

		How gently their great wings flapped ; how easy to fly when
spring	DATE	gives the impulse !

		On another occasion I saw a line of fowls , probably swans , going northward at such a height that they appeared like a faint waving black line against the sky .

		They must have been at an altitude of two or three miles .

		I was looking in - tently at the clouds to see which way they moved , when the birds came into my field of vision .

		I should never have seen them had they not crossed the precise spot upon which my eye was fixed .

		As it was near sundown , they were probably launched for an all-night pull .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, They were going with great speed , and as they swayed a little this way and that , they suggested a slender , all but invisible , aerial serpent cleaving the ether .

		What a highway was pointed out up there !

		-- an easy grade from the
Gulf	LOCATION	to
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay . ''

		This is
Thoreau	LOCATION	to the life , in its concise and noble simplicity .

		We might well suspect it of being an extract from the '' Journals . ''

		The importance of naturistic writers , among whom Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	has a notable place , can not , of course , be compared with that of the humanistic ; for humanism is the real goal of man , and naturism but a mere sidepath .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was right in regarding Fleet Street as more interesting than
Greenwich Park	LOCATION	.

		Naturism , as a cult and code and vocation , distracts man from the city ; that is , from civiliza - tion -LRB- civis -RRB- .

		But as an avocation , the study of bird - life contributes to a noble and broad love of all life , and those who have stimulated this study have a real function in humanism .

		Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	does this .

		He inducts us into a real intimacy with bird - life in all its sweet intensity , its ceaseless , eager , vehement activity , -- birds are never , like beasts and men , mere loafers , -- and he does this without scientific assumption , without moonshiny specula - tion , and without literary finery .

		`` PROVEN '' FOR `` PROVED . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The mail of every week , if not every day , brings to the writer assurance of the growing use of what is for him a most distressing perversion of our good old En - glish speech .

		The latest ofPense is in Admiral
Schley	PERSON	's bill of exceptions to the majority findings of the board of inquiry : `` Which was proven by an overwhelming weight of testimony . ''

		Not long ago a contributor to The Dial was in fault : • ' Herein is the immortality of the poet Tennyson proven '' ; and in the current issue of one of our better magazines , another magazine which has to its credit long years of high usefulness begins an advertisement : '' During the year just passed , ... has proven more fully than ever . ''

		Again , in an editorial in what may , perhaps , be called our leading weekly , there appeared last week : '' But that
America	LOCATION	has as yet no considerable class of such men is proven by varied evidences . ''

		The inflectional ending en for the past participle is an old English form , and is admissible only in the case of verbs which have retained it .

		Prove comes from the Latin through the French , and , like other foreign verbs , has had only the form proved for both past tense and past participle .

		The use of proven is a silly affectation of an unreal archaism .

		The rhetorics are all against it .


Lewis	PERSON	says , `` ' Proven is a Scotch legal term . ''

		Kittredge says , '' The past participle proven should be avoided . ''

		This sort of instruction will have but little effect , if we are constantly to have before us such weighty examples to the contrary .

		The Making op an American .

		*
Jacob Riis	PERSON	, reporter , philanthropist , reformer , author of '' How the Other Half Lives , '' needs no introduction to the nation whose ideals he could scarce honor more highly than he has done in calling his autobiography `` The Making of an American . ''

		The most striking quality of his book is un - doubtedly its artless frankness , which is at first in equal measure appalling and delightful .

		But before one has read far , he agrees unqualifiedly with that wise friend of Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's who told him , when he was hesitating over the first chapters of his reminiscences , '' to take the short cut and put it all in . ''

		She evidently knew her man , understood the absolute unity of purpose that ran through every act of his life , and felt how fatal it would be should his readers miss seeing that here is a man whose house of life has no back doors and no alley windows .

		The whole of Mr.
Riis	PERSON	is in his book , then , and the real Mr.
Riis	PERSON	.

		He is '' speaking right on '' in words that have no fictitious lime - light glare about them , and little of the grace of artful manipulation ; but they are plain - speaking words , whose charm is that they are instinct with the thrill and throb of life , with the joy of labor and the pathos of joy . ''

		The Making of an American '' is the work of a man who deals not with words per se , but with the things behind the words .

		It is the work of a man , too , who never forgets his past in his present , nor loses sight of his defeat because he has turned it into a victory .

		So the second remarkable thing about Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's book is that ftvery page of it is alive .

		And why did the son of a Danish school - master in the sleepy little old town of
Ribe	PERSON	, want to become an American ?

		Because
Elisa	PERSON	- beth , now his '' silver bride , '' had jilted him , out of respect to her father 's very natural scruples about his eligibility as a son-in-law .

		Here was a boy who seemed to have no sense of the fitness of things , who preferred carpentry to schooling , and who during the short time he had spent at his books had been interested in no study but English , and that only in order to read
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's paper , '' All the Year Round . ''

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL scribed to '' All the Year Round . ''

		The boy
Jacob	PERSON	's first years in
America	LOCATION	were difficult enough without the additional hardship that absolute ignorance of the `` American lan - guage '' would have involved .

		He landed in
New York	LOCATION	at the age of twenty - one , with the vaguest notion of what he meant to do next , but with plenty of youthful assur - ance that
Providence	LOCATION	would provide for him somehow , if he only gave her a fair chance . ''

		Of course I had my trade to fall back on , but I am afraid that is all the use I thought of putting it to .

		The love of change belongs to youth , and I meant to take a band in things as they came along .

		I had a pair of strong hands , and stubbornness enough to do for two ; also a strong belief that in a free country , free from the dominion of custom , of caste , as well as of men , things would somehow come right in the end , and a man get shaken into the corner where he belonged if he took a hand in the game .

		I think I was right in that . ''

		The confirmatory sentence comes easily now , but his trust in the ultimate justice of a democ - racy must have been strained well-nigh to breaking in the six years ' struggle that fol - lowed .

		The first two years were spent literally in taking '' a hand in things as they came along , '' -- in putting up miners ' huts on the
Allegheny	LOCATION	, working in clay-bank and brick - yard , as wood-chopper , trapper , hired man , carpenter , ship-builder , and peddler .

		Between jobs the young
Dane	PERSON	was a homeless , often penniless , wanderer , a tramp except at heart .

		But he never lost hope ; instead he faced life with a smile and bided his time for setting right the injustices done him and others like him .

		He tells of one awful night spent in a station house in
New York City	LOCATION	, when he was robbed , and the only friend he had in
America	LOCATION	, a little black-and-tan terrier , was maliciously killed before his eyes . ''

		The outrage of that night became , in the providence of God , the means of putting an end to one of the foulest abuses that ever disgraced a Christian city , and a main -
spring	DATE	in the battle with the slum as far as my share in it is concerned . ''

		Thus Mr.
Riis	PERSON	made acquaintance with Mul - berry Street and the Five Points , in a fashion that was later to give sting and poignancy to the police-reporter 's attitude toward them .

		To these years also can be traced his ambition to be a reporter .

		Writing of his second winter in
America	LOCATION	, he says : '' It was about this time that I made up my mind to go into the newspaper business .

		It seemed to me that a reporter 's was the highest of all callings ; no one could sift wrong from right as he , and punish the wrong .

		In that I was right .

		I have not changed my opinion on that point one whit , and I am sure I never shall .

		The power of fact is the mightiest lever of this or of any day .

		The reporter has his hand upon it , and it is his grievous fault if he does not use it well . ''


Jacob Riis	PERSON	has apparently wasted very little time changing his mind .

		It would take too long to tell how he won
Elisabeth	PERSON	through sheer conviction that he could not do without her , and how for a precisely similar reason , by the hard road of under-pay and over-work , he finally got a staff appointment at Police Head - quarters , on the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune . ''

		Now began the real work of his life , for which everything hitherto had been a sort of preparation .

		Mulberry Street was his chance both from a professional and a philanthropic point of view .

		There were hostile police to circumvent and rival reporters to beat ; there were all the woes of the Other Half to be re - ported in the big sense -- which is always Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's sense -- of the word .

		He prayed that he might do his work well and then he '' dived in , '' bent on exploiting the facts in which he trusted , determined to tell each story of shame and crime so that beneath the `` foulness and the reek of blood '' his readers might '' see its meaning , or at all events catch the human drift of it . ''

		In this spirit he began his career as police - reporter .

		On its professional side it immedi - ately resolved itself into '' a ten years ' war , '' out of which the despised `` Dutchman '' came with what he tells us is the only renown he ever coveted , '' that of being the ' boss reporter ' in Mulberry Street . ''

		The '' battlesome account '' of those stirring days is full of good stories of the ups and downs , the set-backs and triumphs , of the fray .

		The one perhaps which best proves Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's oft-repeated assertion that the true re - porter is a man of power , having absolutely noth - ing in common with the ubiquitous , sensation - loving nuisance who sometimes bears the name , is the story of his famous trip up the Croton water-shed .

		The printed report of what he saw , confirmed by photographs , made a sensation , but it was not sensational .

		It was fact , and the result was an unpolluted water-supply for
New York City	LOCATION	.

		Incidentally the disclosure of the imminent possibility of a cholera epi - demic was one of the biggest '' beats '' on record . ''

		Beats '' alone , however , did not satisfy Mr.
Riis	PERSON	; he remembered his dog and he wanted to settle with
Mulberry Bend	ORGANIZATION	, through which he walked home between one and four o'clock every morning . ''

		There were cars on the Bowery , but I liked to walk , for so I saw the slum when off its guard .

		The instinct 10 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, to pose is as strong there as on Fifth Avenue .

		It is a human impulse , I suppose ... But at 3
A. M.	PERSON	the veneering is off and you see the true grain of a thing .

		So , also , I got a picture of the Bend upon my mind which so soon as I should be able to transfer it to that of the community would help settle with that pig-sty according to its deserts .

		It was not fit for Christian men and women , let alone innocent children , to live in , and therefore it had to go .

		So with the police lodging - rooms , some of the worst of which were right there ... The way of it never gave me any concern that I remem - ber .

		That would open as soon as the truth was told .

		The trouble was that people did not know and had no means of finding out for themselves .

		But I had . ''

		Delightfully Platonic , this trust in the power of truth to make men free ; but it is not ad - vanced as a general proposition , and it was justified .

		There were those who had ears to hear -- the
Charity Organization Society	ORGANIZATION	, the
City Health Department	ORGANIZATION	, the
King 's Daughters	ORGANIZATION	, the various social settlements and tenement commissions , above all President
Koosevelt	PERSON	of the
Police Board	ORGANIZATION	and the rest of the Strong administration , -- and they put themselves at the other end of the line , the organized , ad - ministrative end , whose value Mr.
Riis	PERSON	fully appreciated , though he never meddled with it much .

		`` To represent is not my business .

		To write is ; I can do it much better and back up the other , so we are two for one .

		... I value the good opinion of my fellow-men , for with it comes increased power to do things .

		But I would reserve the honors for those who have fairly earned them , and on whom they set easy .

		They do n't on me .

		I am not ornamental by nature . ''

		Nor did he care to be ornamental .

		Always a worker , he wished to be known as one who worked well ; after that to avenge the death of a little black - and-tan dog .

		This , it seemed to him , could best be done by letting light and air into the slums whose spiritual darkness and foulness had killed his dog , -- by bringing to them the flowers of the fields , by planting small parks there to be bits of God 's country in a godless place , by establishing decent schools and pleasant play-grounds , which are the children 's rights .

		How he '' sat up with his club , '' the fact , until these reforms were achieved , is the story that makes up the last half of his autobiography . ''

		I would not have missed being in it all for anything . ''

		That sentence strikes the keynote of the impression which Mr.
E-iis	PERSON	's book leaves with the reader .

		If its frankness and virility are singular , no less so is its unassuming opti - mism , its keen sense of the joy of combat , of the infinite interest and inestimable value of a life lived honestly and with purpose .

		Every journalist who is weighted with a sense of the futility of newspaper work , passing , as it does , into innocuous desuetude with the next `` extra , '' should read this book .

		He can scarcely fail to get from it an inspiration that will make him view his responsibilities in their largeness and take up his '' club , '' the fact , with new purpose to wield it well .

		But the thesis has a wider application .

		To '' hitch your wagon to a star , '' to make cosmic connections , to see each little day as an important item in a big account , is a philosophy that will ennoble every worker .

		And Mr.
Riis	PERSON	's contribution to its literature is of special value because he shows its practical bearing , freights it with no isms nor ologies , combines it with a very human sense of the importance , not of martyrdom , but of success ; and best of all , perhaps , tinges it with a delightful sense of humor .

		His qual - ity as a humorist and a charming raconteur ^ with a full fund of racy anecdotes about him - self and his friends , each reader must enjoy for himself .

		It has been the purpose of this review to show the motives which made his game of life seem worth while to him , and , from his point of view , gave his autobiography its excuse for being .

		The Financiering of the Confederacy .

		* There has been a sort of poetic glamor cast over the struggle for `` the lost cause '' which has fascinated the mind of even so matter-of - fact a man as the economic historian .

		This is doubtless a partial explanation of the fact that while great portions of the economic and financial history of `` the
United States of America	LOCATION	'' are almost untrodden fields , so con - scientious an investigator as Professor
Schwab	PERSON	has undertaken the task of furnishing us with a careful and comprehensive study of the financial and industrial history of the short - lived '' Confederate States of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The economic history of the Confederacy centres about the efforts made by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	statesmen and financiers to secure the means of carrying on the war .

		Under the wisest administration of fiscal affairs , this would have been a most difficult problem .

		The desire to prove the advantages of slavery as an indus - trial system had led ante-helium writers in the ♦ The Confederate States of

		THE DIAL 11 South to boast of the wealth of the
Slave States	LOCATION	and to compare the resources of this part of the country with those of the North , to the invariable detriment of the latter .

		The fact remains that the South was industrially far weaker than the North , and such resources as she did possess , in her agricultural lauds and her slaves , were unfitted to bear the strain of a long war or to furnish to the government the income necessary to prosecute the struggle .

		Memminger of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, who was selected by President
Davis	PERSON	as the first Secre - tary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, and whose name is likely to be as permanently identified with the Con - federate fiscal policy as that of
Chase	ORGANIZATION	is with the fiscal policy of the Federal government at this time , was not fitted either by training or ability for the position which he occupied ; and his administration met with no considerable success .

		Perhaps no man could have made a success of Confederate finances under the cir - cumstances , and with the ideas in regard to finance then prevailing among the people ; but Secretary
Memminger	PERSON	can not entirely escape the responsibility for the fiscal policy actually adopted . ''

		We miss in him the ability to foresee the inevitable consequences of the measures be proposed , and the power to assume leadership by winning the confidence of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and their cooperation in framing a policy that should have secured the fullest use of the resources of the South instead of one that dissipated and deranged them .

		A financier of like talent to that of the Southern military leaders would doubtless have conducted the affairs of the treasury with more success , '' In accordance with the usual practice of modern governments , the Secretary and Con - gress planned from the very first to place more reliance on loans than on taxes , -- though it is important here to note that , in making pro- visions for the first loan , the Confederate Con - gress voted that an export duty be laid , the proceeds of which were consistently devoted to the payment of the interest on these early bonds .

		As a consequence , these bonds all through the war were quoted at a higher figure than the later issues .

		The first loan of
$ 15,000,000	MONEY	was successfully floated , though it caused a suspension of specie payments in certain quarters .

		The inevitable issue of
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	notes began on
March 9 , 1861	DATE	, and from this time on this measure was frequently resorted to .

		Intended at first as only a temporary expedient , it soon became almost the sole reliance of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	for funds to carry on the war .

		That this would be the inevitable outcome , the experience of other governments had clearly shown ; yet some excuse may be found for the Secretary and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the fact that this was the most popular as well as the expected method of raising the revenue .

		Bonds did not prove popular , and , while a produce loan attempted during the first year of the war met with some success as a means of raising revenue , it led to a demand on the part of the cotton planters , who were unable on account of the blockade to market their crop , that the government should purchase the entire cotton crop in
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	notes made legal tender .

		Memminger at first hesitated , but , finally convinced that this meas - ure would result in the complete ruin of the credit of the government , he advised against it .

		Before the end of
1861	DATE	, the Confederacy was irretrievably committed to the policy of forced loans , in the shape of non-interest-bearing
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	notes , as the chief fiscal reliance of the government .

		Apart from an insignificant customs duty , no provision had been made for taxation .

		The year 1862 brought no improvement in the condition of affairs or in the methods pur - sued by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the Secretary .

		No taxes were levied , and further issues of notes were resorted to .

		Futile efforts were made to prevent the currency from becoming redundant , by making the notes and bonds interchangable .

		This only increased the redundancy ; for debtors wished notes to pay debts , and bonds were ex - changed for the notes .

		Finally , in
September	DATE	, a sweeping provision was made which allowed the issue of bonds and notes to an unlimited amount whenever needed to pay government expenses .

		Strenuous efforts were made to bor - row abroad on the security of the cotton and tobacco secured from the produce loans ; and these efforts met with some success , though , as the speculation in cotton grew , the planters were unwilling to part with their cotton in ex - change for the bonds .

		Agents of the Con - federate government were sent to
Europe	LOCATION	, and in
December , 1862	DATE	, two of these agents suc - ceeded in floating bonds on the basis of cotton as a pledge .

		The bonds could be exchanged for cotton delivered within ten miles of a railway station within the
Confederate States	LOCATION	during the war .

		The French banking house of Er - langer
& Cie.	ORGANIZATION	took the work of floating a loan of 116,000,000 , and would have liked to have a larger loan , so great was the demand for cotton in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In spite of the risky char - acter of the investment , the ''
London	LOCATION	Econo - mist '' rated these bonds higher than Federal 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, securities , and the
fifteen millions of dollars	MONEY	were subscribed five times over .

		The quota - tions went as high as 95 ; but after the Federal victories of
1863	DATE	the price fell .

		Years after the war was over , the foreign holders of these bonds had their hopes raised that the bonds would be redeemed by the government of the
United States	LOCATION	, or by that of some
Southern State	ORGANIZATION	, or from funds of the Confederate gov - ernment supposed to be in some bank in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope .

		The loss to European investors in these bonds , Professor
Schwab	PERSON	estimates at
$ 9,750	MONEY	, - 000 ; while the profits to the Confederacy he considers to have been not more than
$ 1,283	MONEY	, - 930 .

		The failure of note-holders to convert their notes into bonds led Secretary
Memminger	PERSON	to recommend , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to pass , certain measures intended to make funding compul - sory , and which virtually meant repudiation .

		The measures did not accomplish their purpose , and the decline in the value of the notes was much more rapid .

		Funding soon ceased .

		Prices in
1863	DATE	and
1864	DATE	rose to prodigious figures .

		In this latter year .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	, acting on the advice of both President
Davis	PERSON	and Secretary
Memminger	PERSON	, began an admitted vio - lation of contracts , and actual repudiation , by taxing out of existence the notes which their holders refused to exchange for bonds .

		This measure , which caused the complete wreck of the Confederate credit , failed of its purpose -- the prevention of a further fall in prices .

		Memminger resigned in
June	DATE	, and was fol - lowed by Secretary
Trenholm	PERSON	, who sought in vain to restore public confidence by advocating the repeal of the repudiation measures and the adoption of a policy of raising revenue through taxation .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	refused to adopt these recommendations , and the closing days of the Confederacy are marked by the creation of a large floating debt and by government specu - lation in specie , while little attempt was made to keep up the arrears .

		In the matter of legal-tender legislation , the
Confederate	ORGANIZATION	government avoided the mistaken policy of the government at the North , no
Confederate Congress	ORGANIZATION	having actually adopted this expedient .

		It would be wrong to refuse credit to whom it is due , and it is due to Mem - minger in this instance to state that he strenu - ously opposed a legal-tender act in
1861	DATE	, and again in
1862	DATE	; and it is also proper to credit the
Confederate Congress	ORGANIZATION	with having stead - fastly refused to be carried away by the same arguments as at this time convinced Secretary Chase and the
Northern Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Candor compels the further statement , however , that the fact that no other currency than the Con - federate notes existed in the South made the supposed gains from a legal-tender act much less than in the
North	LOCATION	.

		The legal-tender acts of various
Southern States	LOCATION	, and the desperate funding measures of the
Confederate Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1863	DATE	and
1864	DATE	, make it highly probable that the same
Congress	ORGANIZATION	would have adopted a legal-tender act if there had been any hope of raising the value of the depreciated notes by so doing .

		Instructive , entertaining , almost amusing , is the history of the Confederate currency and its effect upon prices .

		Whether or not it was the only fiscal resource that could have been employed by the Confederate government , it is certainly true that it was the one adopted in response to public demand ; and that it was public demand , as well as fiscal exigencies , that caused one issue of notes to follow another .

		In
March , 1865	DATE	, the gold dollar was worth
$ 65	MONEY	in Confederate currency , while the rise in the currency price of commodities was in most cases even greater than the rise in the price of gold .

		Professor
Schwab	PERSON	has made a careful study and comparison of both
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	prices during the war ; but the results of his investigation , best shown in his tables , can not be adequately given here .

		The example set by the central government in the matter of note-issue was imitated by the
State	ORGANIZATION	governments in the South , by the mu - nicipal corporations , and even by private cor - porations and business firms .

		Added to these issues were counterfeit notes , the genuine notes shading off into the counterfeit so that the issue of the latter was scarcely resisted and but little condemned .

		It is perhaps the most unfortunate consequence of the issue of an irredeemable paper currency , that this deviation from the path of strict business integrity on the part of the government is reflected in the lowering of the moral tone of the people .

		The redundant currency in the South encouraged speculation , and speculation encouraged gam - bling of all sorts .

		Gambling was prevalent in all the large cities as well as in the army , and other kinds of vice accompanied it . ''

		Ruffians , thieves , and prostitutes abounded , and vice in every form became common .

		Ttie South from this point of view does not present an attractive picture , which is only matched by the description of the social conditions prevailing at the time of similar upheavals in other countries , -- for instance , in
France	LOCATION	during the
last decade of the eighteenth century	DATE	. ''

		THE DIAL 13 It is pleasant to be able to record that in a time when business morality was at a low ebb , and both the law and public opinion favored the debtor class , especially if the creditor hap - pened to be a Northern man , not all debtors took advantage of the opportunity offered of escaping the payment of their obligations .

		The bankers and merchants of
New Orleans	LOCATION	deserve especial mention for having refused to repudiate their contracts , and for insisting on paying their obligations to their Northern correspondents in full .

		The Secret of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Years ago ,
Lowell	LOCATION	, writing about Shakes - peare , implied an apology in the title of his essay , '' Shakespeare Once More '' ; and yet books are still being written about the world 's master-poet without our having yet come to the feeling that the subject is exhausted .

		In the latest contribution to the study of his message and his art , '' What is Shakespeare ? ''

		by Professor
L. A. Sherman	PERSON	of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, the problem of reaching an un - derstanding of his significance for us , of mak - ing him potent as an element in our culture , is approached in an altogether new fashion .

		It is the author 's belief that
Shakespeare	PERSON	is not for the student alone , but as well for all who will put themselves in the way of receiving his inspiration .

		If this is true , the problem becomes at once a question of training in in - sight ; since certainly , without some sort of preparation , the great mass of those who are reading to-day will not enjoy
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neither will they , or the special student , enjoy him if they are to come to an understanding of him only through detailed explanation from someone else .

		Pleasure in any literary product comes , not in knowing , but in divining ; not in reaching a conclusion , but in following the steps to the conclusion .

		Professor
Sherman	PERSON	's book , then , is not an attempt to explain
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, to find in him new depths of wisdom , to make us see the man afresh in his work .

		It is , instead , an attempt to make it possible for the reader -- any reader -- to come into direct personal relations with
Shakespeare	PERSON	without the intervention of an interpreter .

		Following out this purpose .

		Sec - tion I. is given to a brief discussion of the • What is Shakespeare ?

L. A. Sherman	PERSON	.

		subject ; after which , in Section II. , there comes a running interpretation of the spiritual significance and the art of '' Cymbeline . ''

		Professor
Sherman	PERSON	's scholarly sureness , his keenly psychological gift of analysis , his ready grasp of the spiritual potency of character and dramatic situation , find here very satisfying expression .

		The treatment of the play , extend - ing to over a hundred pages , is as full , as minutely critical , as sympathetic and human , as anyone could well wish .

		All this is , of course , in the way of preparation for what the reader is afterwards to do for himself with other plays .

		The discussion takes up such matters as might or should come into the mind of any discerning reader , -- matters of real human interest , not questions of date , op of position in the order of development of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's powers , or of other things that have a curious interest only .

		At every step the reader learns how to divine by following the process of divination in another .

		Sections III .

		and IV .

		are concerned with a much less exhaustive treatment of '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' and ''
Eomeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' it being assumed that with a little help the stu - dent can now realize
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ultimate meanings for himself , and find pleasure in so doing .

		Section V. takes up the question of '' Shakespeare 's Dramatic Art , '' illustrating it in the main from the handling of character and plot in '' Macbeth . ''

		We have been made to feel something of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's greatness as an artist in the preceding pages ; but here this becomes more luminously real .

		It is a part of the moving power of Professor
Sher	PERSON	- man 's handling of his theme , that human in - terest , vital meanings , and technical skill ofthe artist , are brought before us together as ac - cordant elements of one supremely great literary whole .

		It adds greatly to our relish of a play to follow the author as he shapes its meaning into satisfying and compelling artistic forms .

		A little less than fifty pages are then de - voted to '' Shakespeare the Man , '' a showing of about all that is really known of him , written from the view-point of a charitable under - standing of some of the doubtful things of his life , things which have generally been inter - preted in less kindly fashion .

		This , and the two concluding sections of the book on the '' Groupings of the Plays '' and '' Personal Study of the Plays , '' are in the way of direct giving of information , but it is information which the reader may properly wish to gain at second-hand .

		Time spent in acquiring it for 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, one 's self would be given to consideration of externals , not to getting at the heart of Shake - speare .

		An appendix contains questions on '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' and ''
Twelfth Night	PERSON	, '' of the sort which the author has made familiar to English teachers throughout the country .

		It will be at once apparent that the book is a working tool for students and inquirers , rather than an effort to make literary capital out of a great heritage of the English race .

		If it were to be read merely for its own sake rather than for its helpfulness , the plan of treatment might very properly be criticised , since the different subjects are more or less detached , and they certainly do not follow one another in any definite order of logical devel - opment or of increasing interest .

		Indeed , the concluding portions seem to be , even more than was needful , a gathering up of unrelated matters which it may merely be convenient to have at hand .

		In comparison with such a work as that of
George Brandes	PERSON	, it of course seems in - complete ; the rich glow of the latter , its showing of a brilliant life giving expression to the greatest range of poetry shaped from the most varied experience , is lacking .

		But only the scholar familiar with all that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote can follow
Brandes	PERSON	with steady and in - telligent interest .

		The reader who wishes to obtain at second-hand as much knowledge of Shakespeare as he can in a short time , or who would satisfy his soul with a string of grace - fully phrased sentiments and critical opinions , will be disappointed in the book .

		There are other books that serve such a purpose better ; but for the earnest reader really desirous of commg to fellowship with the world 's greatest mind , we have had few books more truly helpful .

		Recent American Diplomacy .

		* The two books reviewed in this article deal with timely and pressing issues in an interest - ing way , and , in some instances , from different if not opposite points of view .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's work , which may be first considered , is an exposition of five '' questions '' : The Fur Seals and the
Bering Sea Award	LOCATION	, the Interoceanic Canal Problem , the
United * American Diplomatic Questions	ORGANIZATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		States and
Samoa	LOCATION	, the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, and the
North East Coast Fisheries	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is made clear by the author that in the
Bering Sea	LOCATION	controversy the
United States	LOCATION	^ under color of Russian imperial documents , partly forged , vainly asserted the right to ap - propriate a vast expanse of open navigable ocean , in total conflict with the motive and reason of its great struggle in the early part of the century for the freedom of the high seas of the world .

		By the arbitrators we were con - victed of numerous wrongful and violent visi - tations and captures on the public seas , inflicted upon the ships and crews of a friendly power -- the power against which , in
1812	DATE	, we had declared war for similar acts of invasion against ourselves . ''

		It is to be regretted , '' says Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, '' that in this matter the
United States	LOCATION	should have appeared before the tribunal and the civilized world in the unfor - tunate light of taking a step backward in order to resuscitate and reclothe a defunct doctrine . ''

		That the
United States	LOCATION	, by cession from
Eussia	LOCATION	, could take nothing in the main oceans not the common possession of all nations was a decree of the arbitrators fully justified in American organic law and international practice .

		As to our relations with
Samoa	LOCATION	under the
Berlin	LOCATION	Treaty of
1889	DATE	, it is said that their history reveals the first genuine instance of departure from a time-honored policy of non - intervention in the domestic affairs of alien nations .

		Elsewhere it is shown , as was shown a hundred years before , that this rule of non - intervention is based upon a fundamental prin - ciple of the
American State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this novel treaty entered into with
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, it is said that the signatories assumed the responsibility of policing the internal af - fairs and external relations of a people '' not accepted as members of our Union and in whose interests we had , as a nation , not the least concern . ''

		We are told in rapid and lifelike narrative of the inevitable incidents of this form of world-power .

		We read of many flag - raisings , some by American consuls and naval officers , some by Germans , and others again by the greatest of all flag-raisers , the British Empire .

		We read of a great British firm , personifying , for the time being , the '' inter - ests '' of that Empire ; also of a still greater commercial body styling itself Godeffroy and Company , a largely capitalized German con - cern in its later state boasting the rather com - prehensive corporate name of the

Hamburg	LOCATION	.

		It would seem that upon the appearance of this ponderous example of organized wealth among those tropical palm - groves the primacy of
Germany	LOCATION	in the trio of depredators became a mere question of time .

		In the sequel the time proved to be ten years .

		But for that decade of impossibility , sorrow , and bloodshed , we read of many confusions and outbreaks , intensified by independent or cooperative fusillades and naval bombardments of the sea coast Samoan villages .

		The end of our share of this triangular pandemonium was accomplished , as had been its beginning , by an exercise of the treaty-making power .

		The treaty of
1899	DATE	is a diplomatic document which a repentant American statesman might peruse with a mournful sigh of relief .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	refers to it as marking '' the final episode of American complicity in Samoan affairs . ''

		Even Professor
Hart	PERSON	thinks '' the Colonial system as applied in
Samoa	LOCATION	farcical '' ; and he says also that '' the
United States	LOCATION	has for more than a hundred years been a great Colonial power without suspecting it . ''

		The existence of this century of colonial power is explained further on in Professor
Hart	PERSON	's book .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	is moved to give us this en - tire treaty of
1899	DATE	, with its signatures by our
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	and the German and British Ambassadors Extraordinary and
Plenipoten	PERSON	- tiary .

		We have hardly space for the surmise that our Secretary probably demanded and secured the insertion of Article III .

		in which is embodied the
Golden Rule of Diplomacy	ORGANIZATION	, Equal Rights to All the signatory confederates .

		The chief value of
Samoa	LOCATION	as one of our diplo - matic precedents must always be found , not in our military and mercantile successes over the weak and defenseless , not in the promotion of '' interests '' which followed or preceded the flag of our country , but rather in the deeply impressive moral lesson that neither vanity nor passion nor yet self-interest could suffice to postpone longer the necessary measure of re - treat from an unprincipled invasion .

		To those who think they find in flowers culled from the anthologies of history a surer precept for human guidance than that felt in the impulse of the personal conscience , the epic of our
Samoan Colony	ORGANIZATION	will read as something deeper than a farce .

		That colonization was tried in
Samoa	LOCATION	and found wanting is also history , and might have been foretold upon elementary canons of divination .

		The topic to which Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	gives the largest attention is not
Samoa	LOCATION	, but the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are among the conclusions reached by him : In reality the doctrine was only a new name for the right of self-protection ; a principle as old as man himself , called into expression by apprehension of European ag - gression in the Americas . ''

		The Spanish possessions were in revolt and offered a tempt - ing field for the exploitation of European arms .

		The American people were impressed with a sense of danger in every European advance '' ; the doctrine '' voiced that apprehension in a way that satisfied every American citizen . ''

		The author feels no apprehension that our people will not remain '' alert and watchful of their own interests . '' ''

		Higher principles than devotion to the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	will guide -- principles of an organic law upon which the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	is founded and of which the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	was but a single expression . ''

		In Professor
Hart	PERSON	's '' Foundations of Amer - ican Foreign Policy '' is presented a conception of
America	LOCATION	as a '' World Power '' very dif - ferent from that implied , if not asserted , by Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	.

		The first care of the author is to disprove the groundless charge of '' iso - lation . ''

		The truth concerning the accusation is fearlessly retold .

		We are not , never have been , isolated .

		The question when and how to exercise American influence in the counsels of the nations has never been one of prerog - ative , but of expediency reserved to the judg - ment of our public men .

		The key to our foreign policy is not in any formula or maxim of statecraft , but in deep principles of human in - terest .

		Our diplomatic history shows that '' the government has never hesitated to assert itself anywhere on the globe if its interests seemed sufficient . '' ''

		In such a crisis as that of
1898	DATE	, therefore , the
United States	LOCATION	took no new position , but re-asserted what history shows had never been abandoned -- the place of a world-power . '' ''

		All the discussion on the future policy of the
United States	LOCATION	really comes down to the question whether it is to the
National	ORGANIZATION	interest to go far afield in new enter - prises . ''

		The author considers our recent military operations against
Spain	LOCATION	as '' justified by national interest . ''

		True , at first sight they appear '' abnormal . '' ''

		To seize islands , to sub - vert long-established colonial governments , '' '' to distribute dynamite shells among malcon - tents '' -- all these exercises of our '' latent prerogatives in international concerns '' seem to many minds to have been '' an aggressive departure from our
National Policy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This to the author is an unhistorical error .

		We 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Americans live so fast '' that we run away from our own history . ''

		To recall the absent-minded reader to his own country he is pointed to the '' precedents , '' more than sixty in number , of '' actual or authorized use of force outside our National jurisdiction . ''

		These instances , in - cluding the War of the Revolution , the War of
1812	DATE	, and every other big or little American war , are apparently made the basis of the in - ference that the War of
1898	DATE	was not `` ab - normal . ''

		There is among Professor
Hart	PERSON	's other sug - gestive titles a chapter upon '' Brother
Jon	PERSON	- athan 's Colonies . ''

		The author asks : '' What is the essential conception of a colony ?

		Is it anything more than a tract of territory sub - ordinate to the inhabitants of a different tract of country and ruled by authorities wholly or in part responsible to the main administration instead of to the people of their own region ? ''

		Since
1784	DATE	, we have always had such colonies side by side with us as the ruling nation , '' only we have chosen to call them ' terri - tories . ' ''

		Thus
Illinois	LOCATION	and many others of our States were once '' Colonies . ''

		If so , it would seem that they must have been colonies in the special sense in which the ruler abdicates in advance .

		By many this generalization of the term '' colony '' will be deemed a forced one .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	's work is a revised collection of recent magazine articles and is supplemented by an index and a bibliography likely to be of great use to those seeking information upon the momentous questions of vast human in - terest recently and suddenly projected upon the field of American public and private life .

		hundred thousand have gone over him .

		The few years of distance have lessened the degrees of his arc on the horizon .

		Yet , of course , this does not diminish his true importance , nor give any suggestion whereby better to judge his permanent value .

		The high tides and the surges hide temporarily many a solid crag that will look out for centuries above the fluctuant waters .

		But the fact that we are beginning to get away slightly from the first fever of the great Norwegian 's triumph , out of the clutches of the Ibsen cult , suggests that the time is at hand when rational judgments can be formed , when the average person may trust himself to investigate and have an opinion for himself .

		Whether Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	will be one of the true lit - erary immortals , one among the select few , may still be an open question in the minds of well-informed and critical persons .

		But there can be no question that he has been a tre - mendous force in modern literature during the
last half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, that he is a writer of extraordinary originality , and that he has reflected in his writings the peculiar phases and problems of latter-day men and society .

		This means that no well-informed person can afford to be without a reasonable knowledge of the man and the scope and ten - dency of his works and a first-hand acquaint - ance with some portion of his product .

		To this end the re-publication of Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's translation of Jager 's literary biography of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	will be welcomed .

		What remained of the first edition of the work , which appeared in
1890	DATE	, was destroyed in the
McClurg fire three years ago	DATE	.

		This , together with the fact that six important dramas had appeared since that earlier publication , made a new edition doubly desirable .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has written ac - counts of these six later dramas , and united them into a final chapter , which brings the biography down to '' The End of the History , '' so far as the account of the author 's printed works goes .

		As the title of the book indicates , this is an account of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's literary works strung in the order of their appearance upon the thread of his personal career .

		The accounts are just what such reviews ought to be .

		Per - haps they do not leave enough room for com - parison among themselves and with the works of standard writers .

		Perhaps , too , the details of the man 's life are here and there too full .

		But in the main these details throw light upon the dramas .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's translation stands

		One is surprised to find no allusion to Jager 's own later book , ''

Atlantic	LOCATION	that we were prepared to give it a cordial welcome , and it was with no little satisfac - tion that we found its pages to numher nearly seven hundred .

		We are of those who , recalling the ample dimensions of many a work of modern fiction , from
Thackeray	PERSON	to
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, believe that a really good novel can not be too long , and since '' Sir
Richard Calmady	PERSON	'' proves itself to be a really good novel , its length counts among its conspicuous merits .

		`` Lucas Malet '' has done good work before this , upon a lesser scale , -- provokingly good work , in the sense that its possibilities always seemed to be better than its achievement .

		At last , she has given herself full swing , and the result is a work that must be reckoned with as a contribution to serious literature .

		To avoid misunderstandings , we hasten to say that it is not a novel of tendency , it has no thesis to maintain , it is simply a rich picture of human life , as presented in the relations of a small group of people , the chief of whom is so abnormal an individual that it is no small triumph to have so delineated his character that sympathetic interest gets the better of natural repulsion , making us acquiesce in an outcome which at the start we should be in - clined to reject as monstrous .

		Richard comes into the world horribly deformed : his lower limbs are shortened to half the natural length ; his whole history is a struggle to make life ^ eem endurable under such appallingly adverse conditions ; and in the end it is made more than endurable by the love of a woman whose physical endowment is as superb as his own is defective .

		It is a veritable union of souls that we are by gradual but inevitable steps led to contemplate , and in that view we forget all the rest .

		Sir
Richard	PERSON	's life history , as here set before us by Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's admirable art , is interesting through - out all its stages .

		He is a winsome child , and becomes most pathetically winsome when the sense of his difference from other children first obtrudes upon his consciousness .

		He has all that wealth can procure , and in addition all the satisfaction that can be bestowed by social position and dis - tinguished lineage .

		But these fortunate circum - stances serve only to bring into greater relief the contrast between his physical disability and the mode of life which his birth offers .

		The mockery of it all becomes poignantly real to him as he grows to manhood , and finds that nearly all the joys of living , in the physical sense , are denied him .

		Although naturally generous of nature , and of fine spiritual endowment , he becomes morbid and cyn - ical , and for a term of black years gives free rein to the baser elements of our common nature .

		How he is saved from these depths of self-degradation , and finally reconciled with such life as is possible for him , is the theme of the closing chapters , which are strongly moving in their power and beauty .

		One scene in particular is memorable .

		It is in the theatre at
Naples	LOCATION	; Sir
Richard	PERSON	has just touched the nadir of his spiritual abasement , and fate brings upon him the crowning humiliation of physical insult .

		His brain is reeling with imminent fever , and his mental condition , as he sits in his box , is portrayed with absolute psychological mastery .

		This is the turning-point in his career , and when he rallies from the disease it is to grope slowly and with faltering steps upward into the light of a cleansed existence , and a renewed belief in life .

		It has been a hard struggle , but egoism is finally merged into altruism , and with the transformation The Great White Way .

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the world becomes once more a fit place to inhabit , even for such a creature as he is .

		Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	does not gloss over the unpleasant aspects of his life , and her descriptions are often unconventional to the point of daring .

		But we can not think her work open to condemnation for this lack of reti - cence , since its moral purpose is clearly held in view , and worked out with a firm hand .

		Two criticisms seem to us fair .

		One of them is that her hero too continually broods over his misfortune , too continually tortures himself and others by speaking of it .

		Terrible as such an a # Oliction must be , it would in time find its way into the background of consciousness ; it is the wont of nature to provide some sort of workable adjustment even in so des - perate a case as this .

		The other criticism is directed to the machinery of the story .

		The introduction of the chap-book jingle , with its prophecy of Sir
Richard	PERSON	's birth and fortunes , is a melodramatic feature quite unworthy of the art that has given us this sustained and impressive creation of character .

		Popularity may safely be predicted for '' The Benefactress , '' by the author of ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	and Her German Garden . ''

		Considered as a story , it .

		is no great affair , but it makes up for the lack of plot-interest by its acute characterizations of per - sons and places , and by its shrewd humor .

		The heroine is a young English girl whose home sur - roundings are rather vulgar , and who escapes from her depressing English environment through the happy chance of a country estate in
Germany	LOCATION	to which she falls heiress .

		She visits the property with no further intention than that of inspection , but when on the spot , a fine philanthropic notion gets into her unsophisticated head , and she deter - mines to convert her new property into a home for forlorn females with whom the world has dealt harshly , herself living with them as a sort of guardian angel .

		There are to be twelve of the chosen , and they are to be secured by judicious advertising , and careful sifting of the applications .

		When three inmates of the home have thus been secured , the plan is put in full operation , but proves a distressing failure .

		The atmosphere of love and sympathy which the heroine seeks to create for her charges somehow fails to develope , and she is made to suffer for a too confiding faith in human nature .

		Instead of fitting into the scheme of things prepared for them , the women display about every form of meanness and hypocrisy and backbiting .

		Things are all at sixes and sevens , and the benefactress , having learned her lesson , does not know how to escape from her unpleasant predicament .

		Fortu - nately , a neighboring nobleman provides a way of escape upon the usual terms .

		What becomes of the philanthropic idea after their marriage is not related , but we may imagine the outcome .

		Events are huddled far too closely together near the end of the story to be satisfactory , but the author has had her fling , and that is , after all , the main purpose of her book .

		Knowing German life as intimately as she does , her book is charmingly revealing , but we may say fairly that the disagreeable types of char - acter upon which the author 's talents are exercised seem to have been selected with a malicious sort of delight , and that they are not suflBciently relieved by characters of more attractive endowment .

		The book is one to make its German readers wince , and even to make its English readers feel that the so - ciety which it depicts is caricatured rather than portrayed . ''

		The Secret Orchard '' is the work of Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	PERSON	, which is equivalent to saying that it is artfully contrived and full of romantic charm .

		Bat it is a rather poor example of the usually exquisite craftsmanship of these writers , and will add nothing to their reputation .

		The trusting wife , the libertine husband , and the young woman who makes the mischief , are all familiar enough to the novel-reader , and with these three the story is almost wholly concerned .

		It is saved from being commonplace by ingenuity of incident , animation of manner , and a diction which has the touch of delicacy .

		The * ' secret orchard '' is simply a figurative designation of the unhallowed scenes in which unlicensed love accomplishes the wreck of faith and happiness .

		In `` The Traitor 's Way , '' Mr.
S. Levett-Yeats	PERSON	tells a story of the French court and the French wars during the brief reign of
Francis II	PERSON	.

		It is a vigorous narrative , replete with dramatic situations , but not very successful in sketching the historical background of the action .

		The hero -LRB- who tells the story -RRB- assures us at the outset that he is a traitor of the blackest dye , and his performance makes the assurance good .

		A book which has a despicable hero is always handicapped , and the hero in the present instance makes matters worse by the pos - session of a sort of conscience that compels him to insist upon his own villainy upon every possible ^ occasion .

		We are bound to take him at his word , and the result is rather unpleasant . ''

		A woman is something fugitive , irrational , in - determinate , illogical , and contradictory . ''

		These words from
Amiel	PERSON	are given us as the introduction to Mrs.
Peattie	PERSON	's story of '' The Beleaguered For - est , '' and to their concrete illustration the book is devoted .

		It is a story that must be wronged by any retelling , for it deals with temperament rather than action , and the character of the woman who is its central figure is delineated by an infinity of delicate touches , not by a few bold strokes .

		That an impulsive girl should link her fortunes with those of a morose man of middle age , already half - paretic through addiction to an insidious drug , and go off to live with him in his lumber-camp in the northern wilderness -- this is the least part of the story , and yet it is about all there is to tell .

		What chiefly concerns the reader is the development of her character under these conditions , and it is with keen interest that we follow the process by which a strong-souled woman is shaped to take the place of an erratic and irresponsible maiden .

		When the term of her self-discipline is ended by the fortunate
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 death of her husband , and she returns to civilization with the closing chapter , we feel the satisfaction of having witnessed a deeply interesting experiment in kinetic psychology .

		Mrs.
Peattie	PERSON	's book has many good qualities .

		Although it has chiefly to do with a morbid theme , it is rather bright than gloomy , rather high-spirited than dejected .

		It is also amazingly clever in its turn of phrase , so clever , indeed , that it moves in a sort of artificial world of its own , in which people are invariably witty or epigrammatic when they converse , and preternat - urally subtle when they fall into the mood of re - flection .

		The vernacular of the logging-camp , which plays a necessary part in Mrs.
Peattie	PERSON	's novel , reappears in the next book on our list , '' The Strength of the Hills , '' by Miss
Florence Wilkinson	PERSON	.

		Here the scene is not
Michigan	LOCATION	, but the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	, and with this common feature the resemblance ends .

		Miss
Wilkinson	PERSON	's book is the ninth in the '' Amer - ican Novel Series '' of which we have spoken on several earlier occasions , and the second volume of the series to bear a woman 's name .

		It is a much better book than the author 's earlier novel , although certain trivialities of incident weaken it not a little .

		The hero is a semi-educated rustic , a lumberman by vocation , and by avocation an itinerant lay preacher of the Methodist persuasion .

		He is rugged and sincere , but not exactly loveable .

		The novel gets its title from his character , and his personality dominates the action throughout .

		But the book is not all sombre , and many animated scenes relieve the gloom which the hero generally contrives to bring with him .

		In fact , we are rather glad when he is in the background , although his character af - fords the raison d'etre of the writer 's scheme .

		His sister Sararose , wayward and charming , is always a welcome presence , and the serious young woman who understands and almost loves him wins a high place in our esteem .

		Also , and perhaps above all the rest of its good qualities , the book is filled with the spirit of the woods and the mountains , and effectively preaches the Wordsworthian gospel upon every possible occasion .

		The tenth in this same '' American Novels Series '' is by Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	, and its scriptural name is '' Let Not Man Put Asunder . ''

		We surmise the divorce problem from the mere sight of the title - page , but this hardly prepares us for the number of unhappy marital combinations that appeal to us for sympathy and judgment .

		To begin with , the hero and heroine are married and divorced , to be reunited at the very end .

		Meanwhile , the heroine has married another man , himself having a divorced wife living at the time .

		When the latter dies , he takes it so much to heart that he shoots himself , thus leaving the way clear for his second wife to return to her first husband .

		Meanwhile , the hero 's sister has got a divorce from her English husband , and the latter straightway marries another Amer - ican girl , herself the child of parents divorced early , and remarried late in life .

		Here is a coil indeed .

		The purpose of it all seems to be the in - culcation of Mr.
Punch	PERSON	's `` do n't , '' as applied to divorce instead of marriage .

		The sermon is not very effective , for the social difficulties of a divorced person seem to provide the chief arguments against the practice .

		The story has little action , and is characterized by a certain hard brilliancy .

		The occasional attempts to be either pathetic or tragic are made perfectly futile by the artificial nature of both theme and treatment .

		It is natural to expect steady progress in the work of a young novelist of Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's parts , and we think , on the whole , that '' The Real World '' indicates a real advance in his grasp upon life .

		A haunting sense that the shows of existence are not its reality has obsessed the minds of many poets and seers , from
Plato	LOCATION	to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, from Omar to Kant ; -- as
Carlyle	LOCATION	somewhere says : '' All deep souls see that . ''

		But the mind that has once detected the illusion does not rest content ; it strives to construct the elements of a new world that shall have the stamp of reality .

		To it then comes the behest of the spirit chorus in '' Faust '' : `` Prach tiger Baue sie wieder .

		In deinem Busen baue sie auf ! ''

		That way , no doubt , lies mysticism , but that way also lies the possibility of reshaping life in accord - ance with eternal truth and the divine purpose .

		This may seem a solemn exordium for our brief discussion of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's new novel , but the work of this writer has a quality that suggests large ideas and philosophical problems .

		In form , the novel is essentially a biography of its hero during the years that bring him to full manhood .

		We believe that '' Jock o ' Dreams '' was first thought of for a title , which would have had the advantage of indicating more clearly the personal character of the work .

		The hero is a youth who from his earliest years lives a life apart from its dull and vulgar environ - ment , a youth beset by fancies , who slowly struggles upward to the light of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil .

		He finds his real world in the moment of victory over temptation and the triumph of will over sensual impulse .

		The central passage of the book is so fine that we must quote it . ''

		Out of the shadows of things , out of the broken ideals , the wooden dummies with which he had labored so many years , a world seemed to be born , a new world that was true to the touch , where he could live and work untormented by shadows .

		He felt the eternal conviction of will , undebatable and undemonstrable -- the will that shapes and makes ; the will that creates the real from the unreal ; the will that out of pain and labor gives peace ! ''

		The real world is the world in which such abstractions as truth and justice and righteous living are seen to be the only things that are truly concrete , and each of us may , by a resolute exercise of the will , recreate this world for himself .

		There is a quite different sort of realism also to be found in Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's novel -- the sort of literary 20 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, realism of which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is the typical ex - emplar .

		Some of the earlier chapters might almost be taken for the work of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, were it not for their lack of gentle humor and genial philos - ophy .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's philosophy is austere rather than genial , and a somewhat deadly seriousness takes the place of humor .

		This we take to be a defect , as well as the fact that it is rare for one of his characters to impress us as a person of strong vitality .

		In a word , Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's work thus far seems to us over-intellectualized -- a good fault , considering what most novelists expect us to put up with , yet none the less a fault of balance and of sympathy .

		The unexplored regions about the poles constitute about the only part of the earth 's surface that may now be exploited by romancers who wish to be ab - solutely untrammeled by actual fact .

		Central
Australia	LOCATION	, the Gobi desert , and the land of
King Solomon	ORGANIZATION	's mines might properly be put to such use a few years ago , but exploration has now left little to discover anywhere short of the polar circles .

		Both of the poles have recently been chosen for the purposes of romantic fiction , the
North Pole	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Robert Ames Bennet	PERSON	, and the
South Pole	LOCATION	by Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bennet	PERSON	's book is called ''
Thyra	PERSON	, a Romance of the Polar Pit . ''

		The hero gets there in a balloon , and finds a race of hardy Norsemen , the descendants of a daring viking leader who , a thousand years ago , found his way through the icy barrier of the North .

		By a strange chance , a fragment of the Gospels , translated into
Old Norse	ORGANIZATION	, also found its way to the pole , and so we are confronted with the strange spectacle of a com - munity , essentially heathen in tradition , yet having a polity based upon the Sermon on the Mount .

		The adventures of the hero and his companions are very surprising indeed .

		There is a love story , of course , with
Thyra	PERSON	for its polar heroine .

		The narrative has no style worth speaking of .

		Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's '' Great White Way , '' which is '' a tale of the deepest South , '' also has little to boast of in the way of literary art , but it presents a fairly thrilling series of happenings .

		For the Antarctic region also proves to be inhabited by a strange isolated people , to which the explorers find their way by means of yacht and balloon .

		This folk is characterized by the power of thought-transference , which obviates the grosser necessity of speech .

		-LRB- We recall a use of the same idea in an Antarctic romance published about twelve years ago . -RRB-

		The greater part of the story is occupied with the process of reaching the pole , and this is really the best of the book , for the languid race who are discovered at the end of the journey are not of exciting in - terest .

		The jocular millionaire who carries out the expedition provides the book with an element of farce-comedy , but his cheap witticisms grow mo - notonous after a time .

		The love situation , in this case , is created within the limits of the exploring party , and thus dispenses with an analogue of Mr.
Bennet	PERSON	's Arctic heroine .

		Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	has set out to make the American public acquainted with a new Polish novelist , Mrs.
Eliza Orzeszko	PERSON	, whom he calls '' the greatest female writer and thinker in the Slav world at present . ''

		This claim is a safe one , as far as the average reader is concerned , who is probably unacquainted with the work of any other woman writer of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	, or
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		Without venturing to subscribe to Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	's comparative dictum , we may at least say that '' The Argonauts , '' which he has chosen out of some forty volumes to represent the work of this accomplished woman , is a novel well worth reading , and unexpectedly strong in its portrayal of character .

		The Argonauts are the seekers for the golden fleece , and in our modern world they are called money kings and captains of industry .

		These titles are fairly descriptive of Mrs.
Orzeszko	PERSON	's Darvid , who is the central figure in her work .

		He is a man of iron will , command - ing personality , and an extraordinary genius for the solution of business problems .

		These qualities have made him enormously wealthy , but in the process of acquiring fortune , he has neglected his human duties as husband and father , and in the end this neglect recoils upon him , to the undoing of all his happiness .

		His suicide is the strictly logical outcome of such an existence ; it takes the world by surprise , for he is at the height of his success , but the reader , who is shown what the world does not see , understands what it means to be brought face to face with the grim fact that life has been a failure in all its highest and holiest obligations . ''

		The Argonauts '' is a book that strikes no un - certain ethical note , and reveals a virile intellectual endowment on the part of the writer .

		Another of the stronger women novelists of
Europe	LOCATION	is the
Neapolitan Signora Serao	PERSON	, who is already fairly well known to our public .

		A recent translation gives us in a single volume the two stories , or novelettes , called '' The Ballet Dancer '' and '' On Guard . ''

		While we have frequently ex - pressed admiration for the longer novels of this writer , we have felt that they were somewhat over - loaded , and that their excessive realism of the Zola type was a hindrance to their full effectiveness .

		From these two briefer studies we get a finer sense of the writer 's powers , and a far greater artistic satisfaction than we got , for example , from '' The Land of Cockayne . ''

		There is little here that is superfluous ; the presentation is vivid , the psychol - ogy bears the stamp of truth , and the pathos is made the more moving from the very restraint used in its exhibition .

		Two Russian novelists of force and originality have just been introduced to the English public .

		Mr.
Dmitri M	PERSON	^ rejkowski is the author of an am - bitious trilogy in which he seeks to portray the conflict between Paganism and Christianity , not only in the ancient world , when these two gigantic forces literally clashed , but also in the modern world , which still finds the two terms typical of conflicting elements in human nature .

		According
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 to the author 's view , both these elements are legiti - mate and sacred , and he seems to foresee , as a sequel to our present civilization , which treats
Pa	ORGANIZATION	- ganism and Christianity as opposing influences , a future civilization which shall reconcile the two in a single harmonious synthesis .

		The first section of this trilogy is called '' The Death of the Gods , '' and has for its subject the career of the
Etfiperor Julian	PERSON	.

		One can hardly miss the essential similarity between Mr.
M	PERSON	^ rejkowski 's romantic treatment of the great Apostate and the dramatic treatment given it by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, in his wonderful * ' Emperor and Galilaean . ''

		In both cases , there is the same broad sympathy with the ideals of the hero , the same recognition of the hopelessness of his effort , and the same prophetic vision of a time when the old opposition shall no longer divide men from men , and even array the soul of the individual against itself .

		Certainly , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's vision of the '' third kingdom '' is at one with the vision of the author of this romance .

		We shall await with much in - terest the two remaining works , in which
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	and
Peter	PERSON	the Great are to be the central figures .

		Meanwhile , we may say of the present work that it is extraordinarily brilliant in its col - oring , and successfully combines a truly vital in - terest with the truthfulness of scholarship .

		The career of '' Maxim Gorky , '' whose real name is
Alexei Maximovitch Pyeshkoff	PERSON	, has been varied and picturesque .

		Apprenticed to one trade after another , he soon tired of them all , finding a vagrant life much more to his taste .

		He became a cook 's boy on a Volga steamer , a laborer in a bakery , an apple-peddler , a dock hand , a porter , and a railway watchman .

		He has thus seen much of life in its humble aspects and on its seamy side , for his career also includes several terms of imprisonment .

		He was an enthusiastic reader of all sorts of books from childhood , and began his literary career by writing sketches and stories for the newspapers .

		Recog - nition was promptly accorded to his literary work , and now , at the age of thirty-two , he has become one of the most famous of living Russian writers .

		His ``
Foma Gordy	PERSON	^ eff , '' now translated by
Miss Hapgood	PERSON	, is a very disagreeable book , yet a book that holds the attention by its extraordinary power of vivid portraiture , both of the minds and the bodies of its characters .

		We get very near to primitive man in these pages , where the brutish in - stincts of mere animalism find full play .

		This is relieved by an occasional touch of poetry or of mystical exaltation , but the sum total of the im - pression is not far from disgusting .

		In ''
Orloff	PERSON	and his Wife , '' which is a collection of
Maxim Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's short stories -LRB- '' Tales of the Bare - foot Brigade '' -RRB- , we have evidence of the author 's versatility , although the types with which he is wont to deal are generally taken from the lower ranks of life .

		One exception is offered by the story of ''
Varenka Olesoff	PERSON	, '' which is concerned with char - acters of education and breeding .

		It is the only story in the collection that we have read with gen - uine satisfaction , or that proclaims its writer in some sense the compatriot of Tourgudnieff .

		Most of these pieces , in fact , are not stories at all , but realistic sketches of life , portrayals of mood , and psychological revelations .


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	's ''
Nanna	PERSON	, '' published in the popular series of '' Tales from Foreign Lands , '' is a translation of the book called '' A
Paul and Vir	PERSON	- ginia of a Northern Zoae . ''

		It is one of the earlier and slighter works of the versatile Danish novelist and poet , but is nevertheless a charming idyl of sea-coast life .

		As the only one of
Herr Drach	PERSON	- mann 's books thus far turned into our language it deserves a cordial welcome , and all the more so because of the exceptional grace and finish of the English in which it is reproduced .

		There was a time when it seemed the tendency of historical investiga - tion to belittle the heroes of a past generation .

		Either we are having the inevitable reaction , or the modern demand for novelty has caused the discovery of a more productive field in the glossing of characters reputedly debased .

		What - ever the cause , the student of to-day apparently delights in ferreting out undreamed-of virtues and various condoning attainments in the bad men of history .

		Mr.
Frederick Baron Corvo	PERSON	has capped the climax in his '' Chronicles of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Bor - gia '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author has unquestionably delved deep into the literature , and in particular into the church literature , of the Borgian period , and presents his gleanings in a fashion so uncon - ventional as to add greatly to whatever interest may be felt in the subject itself .

		Moreover , the reader who has the courage to accustom himself to the author 's amusing yet distracting use of capitals and full titles , will find in the English employed sufficient entertainment for the time spent in pe - rusal .

		Either Mr.
Corvo	PERSON	is a great master of the English language and disdains to use common words , or he is a distinguished example of the dic - tionary-taught foreigner .

		His method of treatment is as unique as is the language employed ; pro- fessedly scorning a systematic arrangement of ma - terial , he skips from one topic to another with a suddenness that perplexes , yet attracts by its very freedom from restraint .

		It becomes an interesting study to guess where he is likely to touch next .

		As for the subject-matter of the book , the defense of the Borgias becomes an exceedingly easy task by the methods used .

		Mr.
Corvo	PERSON	first postulates the immorality of the times , and so excuses his heroes as simply representatives of their period .

		This suf - fices for the undeniable looseness of life displayed by

		This note of explanations that do not explain has been dominant in the news from the dark continent from the beginning of the war , and it seems to be still in fashion .

		Mr.

		Under the terms of enlistment , he furnished his own horse and most of his equipment , and was to be paid a few pence a week .

		He remained at

		His experiences were not unpleasant -- apart from the humiliating fact of his capture ; and he returned to

		The letters are charming , so far as their style is concerned : the sprightly correspondence of a witty woman of the world .

		From them it may be deduced that
Great Britain	LOCATION	lost no time in beginning the series of errors which still characterize her South African policy .

		The Dutch were antagonized , their prej - udices ignored , themselves made the objects of British contempt , and an open disregard was shown of anything like a desire for a permanent alliance of interests between the two nationalities .

		The letters are valuable as describing in some detail the sowing of the crop of dragon 's teeth which Mr.

		Ten of his recent '' Essays and Addresses '' have been gath - ered into a neat little volume -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , uniform with his `` Obiter Dicta '' and `` Res Judicatae '' ; and those who enjoy Mr.

		The fact that some of these were addresses deliv - ered on `` occasions '' may account for their slight - ness of structure and lightness of treatment -LRB- e. g. , the address on the

		His book , '' The Desert '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is not a work of travel , nor is it an artist 's diary of two years ' enforced sojourn in the desert .

		It is better described by the sub - title , '' Studies in Natural Appearances , '' and is a very comprehensive discussion of the arid world in all its aspects , though never technical and always full of life and interest .

		First impressions of the desert landscape , the make of the desert , the in - cessant strife , of contending forces and the inevitable triumph of silence and desolation , are all portrayed with skill and power .

		The mirage , the desert sky and clouds , and the wonderful color effects , are described and critically analyzed from the artist 's point of view , while the scientific explanation of the phenomena is given in untechnical language .

		The writer is also a naturalist of very keen powers of observation .

		The struggle for life is here at its keenest ; sharp and thorny , lean and gaunt , swift and fierce , are the favorite adjectives .

		The Painted Desert , the Grand Canyon , the mesas and foothills of
Southern Arizona	LOCATION	, and the mountain barriers of
California	LOCATION	, are described with equal charm .

		No less pleasing are the occasional glimpses of the author 's personality which the reader catches from time to time in his soliloquies on art and nature , on life and destiny .

		It is larger in scope than her volume on '' Women of the French Salons , '' but , like the earlier work , is scholarly enough to be authoritative without being compendious enough to be dull .

		How hard it must have been for a modern woman to write of Sappho and the

		She says unmistakably , '' So much we know ; the rest we can only guess . ''

		To this wisdom of keeping her historical conscience clear , she has added that of choosing a sensible point of view .

		She discusses the women of the early and the later ages of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, of the early Church , and of the Renaissance , not in their relation to any narrow phase of the '' woman question , '' but as all - around beings who have husbands , children , homes , and social graces , as well as political possibilities .

		A more just and wholesome estimate than this of the gains and losses of the modern woman , it would be difficult to find .

		But with all her scholarliness and wisdom , the author does not forget that '' it is necessary also to please . ''

		Her writing is never heavy , and her wit is often deliciously caustic .

		Her sense of selection is unerring , and saves her work from being crowded and encyclopaedic .

		The club woman who has a paper to write may think the chapters discursive , and the historic thread of '' this from that '' too slightly traced .

		But he who reads for enjoyment will find ample amends in the delicately appreciative pictures of the women of the past , and the pungent comments on the times in which they lived .

		Music : Us nature and Us masters .

		In '' Music and Its Masters '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , Mr. 0 .

		B.
Boise	LOCATION	, a musician of international reputation , has en - deavored , through showing the true nature of music and the conditions that are essential to its growth in breadth and significance , to incite amateurs to a more respectful consideration of its claims .

		All real students are familiar with the history of music , from the first pan-pipe to the elaborate perfection of the modern orchestra ; so that this portion of his work , together with his treatise on the origin of music and the character of its action on intellect and emotion -- favorite themes with aesthetic phil - osophers , -- are superfluous .

		His discussions on musical compositions , from
Polestuna	LOCATION	to the present day , are more a propos ; and in his critical analysis of the works of the great musicians he is particu - larly successful in showing the special intention of each master , the individuality , and , where pos - sible , the underlying purpose of his art .

		It is not hard to discern that the author is a keen Wag - nerian , and consequently holds a high opinion of
Brahms	PERSON	and
Tchaikovsky	ORGANIZATION	.

		The earnest study of any branch of learning broadens the perceptions ; and when Mr.
Boise	PERSON	formulates his reasons , tersely and precisely , for naming
Bach	PERSON	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Schu	PERSON	- mann ,
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	, as the epoch-making musicians , we realize the true value of his critical ability .

		The book is pervaded by an enthusiasm which gives a peculiar zest to its critical portions ; it is not technical in the ordinary acceptation of the term , although the mention of certain fundamental principles was necessary in forming a basis for the author 's sesthetic theories .

		Colonial Fights and Fighters '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is his latest contribution to the literature of gore , -- the successor in publication , though the predecessor in historical time , of his '' American Fights and Fighters . ''

		His point of view is admirably set forth in the ad - jectives with which he decorates his dramatis per - soncB , thus : '' The proud , cruel , domineering , in - domitable Spaniard '' ; '' the gay , debonair , dashing , brilliant Frenchman '' ; '' the merciless , rapacious , lustful , yet courageous Buccaneer '' ; '' the base , brutal , bloodthirsty Pirate '' ; '' the plumed and painted Savage with his fearful war-cry , his stoic endurance , his subtle strategy '' ; `` the cool , stub - born , persistent , persevering , heroic Englishman '' ; and '' the hardy Colonist , adding to his old-world stock the virtues generated by the new life in a new land . ''

		These phrases seem to indicate a certain lack of the humorous sense in the reverend author : what a re-arrangement of epithets there would be , for example , if the painted Savage were permitted to put in print his impressions of the heroic En - glishman and the hardy Colonist !

		Unquestionably the book is interesting -- just as the apples were to our first parents in the
Garden	LOCATION	.

		So was its com - panion volume on '' American Fights and Fighters , '' and so will be the volume newly announced on '' Pioneer Fights and Fighters . ''

		But there will be the feeling in certain quarters that the books will be read , not for the excellence of the cause for which the fighting was done , -- for there seems to have been just as many fighting against the cause as for it , -- but for the fighting itself ; and if this is what Christianity is coming to mean in the
twentieth century	DATE	, the lees we have of it from the clergy the better .

Syria	LOCATION	and There was no portion of the ancient Palestine in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	world that was so often early Umes .

		overrun by invading armies as the eastern shore of the
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	.

		Its loca - tion between the great powers of
Asia	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	made it of peculiar importance .

		Professor
L. B. Paton	PERSON	's '' Early History of
Syria	LOCATION	and Palestine '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a collection and presentation of the main facts found in the literatures of ancient oriental peoples touching this small section of country .

		The whole stretch of time covered extends from the earliest traditions and records of the population of those lands down to the fall of Babylon in 538 B. C .

		This period is broken into thirteen chapters .

		Some of those preceding the settlement of the Hebrews in Palestine are '' The Earliest Inhabitants , '' '' The Old Babylonian Supremacy , '' '' The Amoritic Mi - gration , '' `` The Rule of the City of Babylon , '' '' The Canaanitic Migration , '' '' The Egyptian Su - premacy , '' and `` The Rise of the Aramaean Nations . ''

		In the treatment of each of these chapters , the author has either consulted the sources themselves , or specialists who deal directly with the ancient records .

		His scrupulous care in dealing with the actually recorded facts of those records is every - where in evidence , unless we should except his method of dealing with the records of the earlier books of the Old Testament .

		Theories seem largely to have dominated much that he has to say on the statements recorded in the
Hexateuch	LOCATION	.

		But the book does a valuable service in collecting and arranging material otherwise found only in scores of works .

		The Bibliography of the subject and the chronological tables are especially serviceable for students who are entering upon the study of those early times .

		Index and maps also add no small part to the completeness of this volume -- a useful handbook for every student of the ancient Oriental world .

		When Mr.
H. G. Hutchinson	PERSON	in his The borders ^ ^ ^ .

		^ ^ ^ '' Dreams and their Mean - of dreamland .

		• „ , ^ x i , , i ings -LRB- Longmans -RRB- tells the reader that he introduced a sketch of what science has to say about dreams so as to '' bring the reader up -LRB- or down -RRB- to that equal state of ignorance with the writer , '' he disarms all criticism .

		This is an avowedly popular book , is agreeably written , and in large measure is a contribution to the anthro - pology of dreams .

		There is , too , an entertaining discussion of the dreams that are of most frequent occurrence , upon which the author has collected quite a fund of material .

		The dreams of falling , of flying , of appearing in society with a shocking paucity of garments , of being pursued by a bogey , or even of dying and holding a post-mortem exam - ination of oneself , -- these all occur and are variously presented from the answers of correspondents .

		Upon this follow two rather dreary and inconse - quential chapters from the material furnished by the Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	as to telepathic and premonitory dreams .

		The whole volume thus does nothing more than loiter agreeably in the outskirts of an interesting region .

		It is a traveller 's account of a country , lightly and agreeably presented ; not a student 's report upon the fauna and flora .

		Taken at its proper standard , it forms as agreeable an in - troduction to this aspect of dreamland as may easily be found ; but whether it is a good or desirable side is another question .

		For people who like this sort of book , this book may be recommended as the sort they are likely to enjoy .

		Burton
Kingsland	LOCATION	's '' Etiquette of poiueness for All Occasions '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, for Americans .

		p ^ gg ^ Q ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ title that is too inclusive .

		The author is concerned only with a single class -- that comprised in what is known as '' polite society , '' -- and only with making those in this class as polite as possible .

		Now there are occasions in life which have little or nothing to do with polite society as such , and there are other oc - casions in which it seems to be necessary to be im - polite ; and these Mrs.
Kingsland	LOCATION	leaves quite alone .

		It was
Sidney Smith	PERSON	, if recollection serves aright , who remarked that the memory of social obliquities
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 persisted when that of sins failed ; and in a society so plastic as that in
America	LOCATION	, the need for instruc - tion among those who are going up the social ladder is doubtless great .

		For these , such books as this are written .

		Nothing is said , however , about such methods of climbing as involve the snub - bing of those outstripped in the ascent , or the con - ciliation of those above ; nor are any provisions made for those who might like to climb down with ease , if not with grace .

		What the book might con - tain to advantage is a plain statement that the practice of polite manners , as generally understood in the
United States	LOCATION	, requires a certain endowment of wealth , -- social position of almost any sort being based upon expenditure more or less lavish .

		The book has a praiseworthy chapter on manners in the older countries ,
France	LOCATION	in particular , from which it may be learned that Americans at their politest have still a great deal to learn .

		Generally speaking , American etiquette might be discussed under two heads : When Does it Pay to be Polite ?

		and When Does it Pay to be Rude ?

		Mr.
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	has cast much light on this alternative problem in his admirable '' Theory of the Leisure Class . ''


Hamilton	PERSON	' ^ ^ ^ little volume on
Alexander Ham	PERSON	- at a builder ilton , written by Mr.
C. A. Conant	PERSON	of the
Republic	LOCATION	.

		f ^ r the `` Riverside Biographical Series '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is only an outline of the great career of its subject , but it shows the skill of the trained student and writer in its clearness and pro- portion .

		Mr.
Conant	PERSON	seems to be of the opinion that the form of our government , its successful establishment , and its later greatness , are due to
Hamilton	PERSON	more than to any other man .

		Wash - ington and
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Marshall	PERSON	are made sec - ondary in their direct influence toward these ends .

		This impression may be due to the narrow limits of the sketch , and the fault of making its subject the centre of influence is partly inherent in histor - ical biography ; but the reader who is familiar with our history can easily supply the other influences that were working with
Hamilton	PERSON	's , while the un - trained reader will get from the book what he needs to fill out the common idea of our early national history .

		A brief The history of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	from biography of a biographical point of view is pre -
Cromweii	PERSON	.

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new reprint of the earlier work by Mr.
Samuel Rawson Gardiner	PERSON	.

		Though revised by the author , little change has been made in the subject matter .

		The work has long been regarded as a model in condensed biographical writing , and its appearance at a moderate price will certainly be wel - comed .

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's
Cromwell	PERSON	differs from the more modern
Cromwell	PERSON	in that greater stress is laid upon the earlier and military period of his life , and less upon his acts as a ruler of
England	LOCATION	.

		Present - day criticism attributes to Cromwell a great genius in constructive statesmanship .

		This is not the view of Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	; though the plea is not combatted , for it had not arisen at the time the book was writ - ten .

		It is likely indeed that in the recent Crom - well revival a greater prescience has been credited to him than he was rightly entitled to ; and in this respect an acquaintance with Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's simple , honest , and God-fearing hero will well serve to restore a just balance .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		For the curious , '' The Last Words of Distinguished Men and Women '' -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.
Frederic Rowland Marvin	PERSON	, will have a melancholy interest .

		The names of those whose death - bed reflections are here recorded are arranged in alphabetical order , and in most cases a few lines , sometimes a page or two , of bio - graphical comment are added .

		The compilation has evidently been made with care , and in details of ty - pography and printing the book is very satisfactory .

		A wide range of names is covered in the three hundred and more pages , and the volume should have some value for reference , Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	has compiled for Messrs.
McClure	PERSON	,
Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a selection of '' Songs of Na - ture '' from English and American poetry .

		The volume is a very personal one , being made up wholly of the things that the editor likes , rather than of the things generally approved .

		The introduction makes some pertinent observations , such as : '' The painted , padded , and perfumed Nature of many of the younger poets I can not stand at all . '' ''

		When I find poppies blooming in the corn in an American poem , as I several times have done , I pass by on the other side . ''

		A serious hook , but one in which the subject is too comprehensively grasped to be devoid of humor , is Mrs.
Heloise Edwina Hersey	PERSON	's '' To Girls : A Budget of Letters '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author 's ex - tended experience as an educator enables her to speak with authority , and this same experience has given her that charity which does not fail because strenuous de - mands are made upon it .

		The lighter phases of life are touched upon , as well as the great questions of all ages -- religion , wealth and its uses and abuses , health , and a thousand things besides which may be read with advantage by the sex to which the letters are not ad - dressed as well .

		There is a notable absence of cant throughout the book .

		`` The Laurel Song Book , '' edited by Mr.
W. L. Tomlins	PERSON	for advanced school work and choral societies , is published by
Messrs. C. C. Birchard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The collection is noticeable for its large proportion of compositions by recent writers , mostly Americans .

		While the aim is laudable enough , while excellent things are written by modern composers , and while the taste of Mr.
Tomlins	PERSON	himself is nearly always true to a high mark , yet we can not but feel that young people should be occupied chiefly with songs that have an unquestioned place in the history of culture , rather than with recent compositions , no matter how meritorious .

		The songs we learn in childhood remain with us for life , and it means a great deal to go through life with the immortal melodies ringing in our ears .

		Nothing should be al - lowed to divert the teacher of singing from this con - ception of his primary obligation .

		THE DIAL 27 of French literature will find it particularly useful for orientation in the regions of recent poetry and the drama , which , even more than the others , need just such a survey as is given them in this satisfactory study .

		The stories are very brief , very numerous , and very simply told .

		The pictorial features of the book , although of a sort frowned upon by severe educational theorists , will doubtless be welcome to the childish reader . ''

		It is just such a book as we should expect from Mr.
Lang	PERSON	upon the subject , wise and witty , un - expectedly allusive , temperate in its judgments yet warmly sympathetic with the genius of the poet .

		Con - sidered as sober criticism , it is a book of fine insight and thorough acquaintance with its subject .

		It is also a book that scintillates with epigrams , and reflects light from many strange sources .

		With all its seeming light - ness of manner , it really outweighs almost any of the graver commentators .

		BRIEFER MENTION 56 NOTES 56 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 57 PHASES OF LITERARY CRITICISM .

		It is generally conceded that in the domain of literary criticism ,
America	LOCATION	is far behind
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Is this be - cause the American people are too busy to think ?

		Is it because , when they have a few hours to spare from the mad scramble for money , they devote themselves to recreation and amusement and let books take care of themselves ?

		Is it because the morning and afternoon newspapers supply all their needs in the way of reading , with an occasional frothy novel snatched up and devoured with no higher literary purpose than to find out whether the hero and heroine marry in the last chapter ?

		There can be no doubt that the constant reading of newspapers spoils the mental appe - tite and digestion for thoughtful , masterly books .

		So many people are concerned with the present , with the concrete affairs of every - day life , that they actually think it a waste of time to read anything that will improve their minds .

		Hence the works of learned professors and of great authors -LRB- I do not mean popular authors , though certainly some of the latter are great -RRB- have a surprisingly limited circulation as compared to the whole population of the country .

		And even yet comparatively few people make a hobby of books as they do of other things .

		If high-class and scholarly books now go begging among the masses , it follows that critical effort shares in the general apathy .

		There is little inducement for scientific criti - cism to assert itself .

		The output of the pub - lishers is too often reviewed by professional critics in that perfunctory and hackneyed fash - ion which carries less and less weight each year with the general reader .

		Why ?

		Because professional critics are seldom original think - ers .

		Besides , so enormous is the inflow of books -- largely worthless -- that , in order to keep their desks and tables half-way cleared , newspaper critics often '' notice '' volumes of which they have not even cut the leaves .

		Scientific criticism is not accomplished in or for a day , a week , or a month .

		Criticism of a quality worthy the name implies that its pro- 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, ducer has lived as well as browsed in a library ; so that he knows his own capacity not only to think , but to love , to feel , to suffer .

		In other words , he must know some of the true mean - ings of life from actual experience , and not alone from study and hearsay .

		This require - ment , too , makes the great poet , -- as well as the great man in whatever walk of life .

		Lit - erature and art are in their broadest sense expressions of life , of which the creative mind interprets some or many phases .

		Someone has defined art as truth filtered through a person - ality .

		But these definitions amount to very little .

		The main thing is to winnow the wheat from the tares in literature , and to read only such works as have intellectual beauty , moral force , and those ineffable inspirations which strengthen mind and character .

		Contemporary criticism of the highest qual - ity shows a wide divergence from that of fifty years ago , in that it is more liberal , more thor - ough , more expert .

		Its standards are higher .

		Arrant trash it usually leaves alone , as not worth wasting time over .

		This was once not so .

		Compare the quibbling , sometimes vicious , criticisms of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	with the calm and philosophic utterances of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Yet to some minds Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	was often too academic , too nonchalantly sure of classic criteria .

		With most men and women , popular expo - sition still wins the greatest favor , -- just as in creative literature what is simple and universal makes the strongest appeal .

		If there is one thing more than another that has vitiated En - glish and American criticism within the
past half century	DATE	, it has been the tendency to sneer without cause , to make light of serious efforts , to lug in the morbidly introspective or the merely flippant things .

		Here and there a clear - eyed and clear-minded student rises to the requirements of the hour and gives us the final products of his analysis and ratiocination .

		Such results represent the most conscientious insight plus a broad culture and that indispensable something which we call style .

		We need more critics , not less ; but we want them on the order of
John Addington	PERSON	Sy - monds ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	, Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	,
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	,
Edmund Clarence Sted	PERSON	- man .

		Do we need such critics as
Taine	LOCATION	, whose relentless and inadequate logic so repelled , dried , corroded , and saddened the delicate yet far from effeminate soul of Amiel ?

		The read - ing of
Taine	LOCATION	, he said , had to him '' the smell of the laboratory ; it never inspired , but only informed , and gave algebra to those who asked life , the formula for the image , the heady fumes of distillation for the divine intoxication of Apollo . ''

		As to a portion of
Taine	PERSON	's work , this seems aptly true .

		Time and again I have tried to read '' On Intelligence , '' and always with the same result -- a sort of hungry dis - appointment .

		`` One must stand as well with the public sentiment as with God himself , '' says the
Talmud	LOCATION	; and it also says , '' To the wasp men say .

		Neither thy honey nor thy sting . ''

		If the critic has something to tell from the depths of his own heart , who will not listen ?

		We shall not think of him then as a man who has failed as an author and turned blackguard ; but as one who understands and respects his vocation .

		It is an admirable thing to be sure first of the good points in an author 's work , to be attuned to the best that is in him .

		Few men are always equal to their best , and per - haps if they were they would become monot - onous or too strong for human nature 's daily food .

		If Homer sometimes nods , if
Lowell	LOCATION	drops occasionally from his higher moods , if
Stevenson	PERSON	ranges from the most exquisite word-carving to childish dalliance , if Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	frequently strains his diction to its most attenuated limits , even if Mr.
Howells	PERSON	some - times prefers to exalt the commonplace with an art fit for the realms of pure Romance , -- we should remind ourselves that they all were or are human .

		If , in print , we choose to differ from them we must be certain that our point of view is at least wide enough to stand upon with both feet .

		Sainte-Beuve said of
Massillon	LOCATION	: '' It is not given to all minds to feel and to relish equally the peculiar beauties and excellences of Mas - sillon / To like
Massillon	LOCATION	, to enjoy him sincerely and without weariness , is a quality and almost a peculiarity of certain minds , which may define them .

		He will love
Massillon	LOCATION	who loves what is just and noble better than what is new , who prefers elegant simplicity to a slightly rough grandeur ; who , in the intellectual order , is pleased before all things with rich fertility and cult - ure , with small sobriety , with ingenious amplification , with a certain calmness and a certain repose even in motion , and who is never weary of those eternal com - monplaces of morality which humanity will never ex - haust . ''

		It is doubtful if
Schopenhauer	PERSON	would have felt edified by hearing the great French divine ; for
Schopenhauer	PERSON	had the incredible temerity to say that '' no change of human nature can ever be affected by the spread of moral doc - trines . ''

		So here again is the point of view , which must not be lost sight of for a moment .

		If a man stands aloof in bis own inflexible
1902	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 37 egotism to judge the efforts of others , he never can be a true critic .

		He must divest himself of personal prejudices and blind habits of ar - bitrary taste .

		If he applies comparisons , they must , in all justice , be such as he would will - ingly have his own statements weighed by .

		In other words , the critic owes it to his readers to put himself in the author 's place as much as possible .

		This , to be sure , was not
Macau	LOCATION	- lay 's way nor
Jeffrey	PERSON	's .

		Macaulay was a blind partisan in his decisions about everything .

		He sometimes demolished '' his man , '' and then set him up again as he thought the man should have been in the first place .

		And we derive an idea from reading Macaulay that he was not so shrewd in his discrimination as his in - telligence was colossal .

		Even when on the wrong side of a question he was forcible and clear , but these very qualities only made more vivid and complete his errors .

		With true British obstinacy , he would argue out an ab - surd proposition to the bitter end , sometimes as though in sheer desire to turn on a torrent of literary and historic allusions .

		The ideals of a by-gone age are not binding upon us , except as we wish to have them so .

		We are far removed from much of the pagan thought which coexisted with the highest civi - lization of the Greeks .

		They bequeathed much that the cultivated race of to-day would not willingly lose ; but have we not gained much that they never had ?

		It is the business of criticism to keep in touch with the movement of evolution and with the spirit of the twentieth century .

		Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	declares that '' the whole art of criticism consists in learning to know the human being who is partially re - vealed to us in his spoken or written words . ''

		This shows that Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	is as much inter - ested in life as in literature -- a good symptom in any kind of a connoisseur .

		To some bookish souls literature is life itself , and the men and things around them vague shadows .

		A poetical friend of mine often confesses that he lives in the moon , and his practical knowledge of every - day matters is most amazing or amusing , ac - cording as one may regard it .

		We are a great deal better organized socially and intellectually than people were in that age which '' made no sign when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, its noblest son , passed away . ''

		Two sayings of
Emerson	LOCATION	-- `` Great - ness appeals to the future , '' and `` To be great is to be misunderstood , '' -- contain clues to the reason why some great authors are not always appreciated in their own generation and country .

		Censure does not necessarily imply a stand - ard .

		A man may inveigh against something without having taste or sensibility to back him .

		Censure is no more the purpose of true criticism than is praise .

		Nearly every fool thinks he can write a book , and most fools think they can criticise one .

		The greatest skill , however , is not displayed in tearing down , but in building up .

		It is wisely put in
Max Miiller	LOCATION	's epigram : '' It is the heart that makes the critic , not the nose . ''

		And by Richter : '' Criticism often takes from the tree caterpillars and blossoms together . ''

		Our best thinkers have brought about a mental and moral uplift in the ranks of the great middle classes of the
United States	LOCATION	, who demand for themselves and for their children the best that our men of genius can produce .

		And with such a gigantic incentive as the favor of the best portion of the American public , our authors are rising magnificently to the occasion , and will lift professional criticism too .

		Some of our very best criticism , which the public knows nothing about , is performed in the lead - ing publishing houses and by the editors of the great magazines .

		The readers and literary advisers employed by these publishers are men and women of exceptional ability in their field .

		They reject probably 90 per cent of the manu - scripts submitted to them , and though they thus disappoint many aspirants they maintain a certain creditable standard .

		Many worthless manuscripts are published sooner or later , but they do not come out with the imprint of any high-class firm ; they lack the stamp which presupposes at least good workmanship .

		Again , many manuscripts have good material in them , but are technically faulty ; in which case they are sometimes sent back to be revised by the author .

		The same is true of
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		sent to magazine editors .

		Thus , in many ways , the public is spared the pain of reading shoddy or slatternly writing in books and publications issued by these careful and exacting houses , which have won their reputation by these methods .

		Critical acumen and skill enter into this routine to an extent undreamed of by the average reader .

		Many expert editors handle the '' copy '' in a large magazine office , and errors seldom escape their Argus eyes .

		Indeed , if some books , even by veteran authors , were published as written , without pruning or altera - tions by a sagacious editor , the critics would be neglecting their duty not to condemn them with merciless vigor or ridicule them out of the market .

Jan. 16	DATE	, C ^ ^ Ittto § 00ks .

		The Truth about
China	LOCATION	.

		* When the tenth edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica	ORGANIZATION	comes to be issued -LRB- is not its pre - decessor even now growing obsolete on our shelves ? -RRB-

		no article will demand more thorough re - writing than that which is headed ''
China	LOCATION	. ''

		That the torpid self-centred existence of ages should have been so violently shaken by the war of
1894	DATE	and the explosions of
1900	DATE	, and should thenceforth reluctantly but inevitably form part of the nervous fretwork of the na - tions , are among the most significant facts of the last turbulent decade .

		Of the score or more of books on
China	LOCATION	-LRB- in English alone -RRB- brought out since the dramatic scenes at the Peking Legations during that memorable sum - mer , the majority will have their day and cease to be .

		Made up of impressions received during the strain of those trying days , they are good material for the historian rather than historical writing .

		Of all countries ,
China	LOCATION	offered the least appui to the impromptu interpreter of national feeling as voiced in national move - ments ; the only safe rule apparently being to reverse the application of occidental motives , so far as they can be retraced from results .

		To do this with discretion -- that is , with a knowledge when not to do it -- is not vouch - safed to war correspondents or the average globe-trotter ; nor must it be expected of them .

		We are now pretty well assured that an ade - quate account of the recent crisis in
China	LOCATION	could be prepared only with the aid of special natural gifts , and after long residence in the country , supplemented by a full acquaintance with the possibilities -- and impossibilities -- of the Chinese language .

		For these things not many men are sufficient ; but probably no living writer more nearly fulfils their hard conditions than does Rev.
Arthur H. Smith	PERSON	, who is already so widely and favor - ably known as the author of '' Chinese Char - acteristics '' and '' Village Life in
China	LOCATION	, '' and who now presents us , in two handsome vol - umes , the winnowed results of a life of thought and observation , under the appropriate title of ``
China	LOCATION	in Convulsion . ''

		In a certain sense the book has been nearly thirty years getting itself written .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	knows the Chinese character better probably than any other living *

Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		American .

		His long residence and study , his penetrating eye for detail , his judicial temper , his piquant style , and his saving grace of humor , make a combination of qualifications whose net result , as seen in this book , is the most interesting and authoritative document in its somewhat crowded class .

		The author recognizes at the outset the dif - ficulty of his task , quoting with approval Mr.
A. R. Colquhoun	PERSON	's somewhat ponderous sen - tence , '' immense and indefinite duration multi - plied by incomputable numbers of population must make an aggregate literally incompre - hensible . ''

		In the first chapter , entitled '' Re - moter Sources of Antipathy , '' Chinese seclusion , ignorance , and conceit are admirably described without being accounted for .

		The national aversion to foreigners , according to Dr.
Smith	PERSON	, needs no further rationale than the fact that the foreigners are not Chinese .

		But this funda - mental reason has been well buttressed during the past century by international complications , arising mainly from foreign eagerness to press trade upon reluctant
China	LOCATION	; and by the distrust which the introduction of Christianity has aroused among the literary classes .

		About this vexed matter of the missionaries Dr.
Smith	PERSON	speaks with perfect candor .

		Aside from the natural unwillingness of Chinese scholars to admit that anything could be added to their wisdom , there is the special question of ancestral worship , a central tenet of Con - fucianism , and the first one to be abandoned by Christianized Chinese .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	adds : '' We are not concerned at this time either to defend the almost universal judgment of the Christian church in
China	LOCATION	in regard to the worship of ancestors , or to inquire by what means some via media may be employed to combine reverence to man and worship to God , so that neither shall infringe upon the other .

		Our object is simply to make it clear that we recognize the present attitude of the Christian church -LRB- Protestant and Catholic alike -RRB- as a great bar to the spread of the Gospel in
China	LOCATION	, and perhaps as the most potent single cause of Chinese hostility . ''

		The anti-foreign riots of the past forty years , directed mainly , but not exclusively , against missionary stations , are rapidly sketched , be - ginning with the attack , in
1868	DATE	, on the Inland Mission at
Chen Chiang	PERSON	; and including the Tientsin massacre -LRB- 1870 -RRB- , the anti-French riots at
Shanghai	LOCATION	-LRB- 1874 -RRB- , and the various outbreaks in '' turbulent
Canton	LOCATION	. ''

		The bitter hatred which both fomented these attacks and was increased by them received , in the
last quarter of the century	DATE	, fresh impetus from the '' commercial intrusion , '' chiefly of railways ,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 telegraphs , and mining enterprises ; and from the various acts of territorial aggression on the part of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Probably there is not another country on the planet where events and conditions such as have been very imperfectly hinted at would not long before have pro- duced an outbreak . '

		What the Barbarians want , ' said a ruler quoted in
Mencius	LOCATION	, ' is my territory . '

		The events of the past few years had made it clear to the per - ceptions of the Manchu rulers of the Chinese Empire that , in these days also , ' what the Barbarians want is my territory . '

		The Barbarians were , it is true , numerous and strong , but so were the Chinese .

		The more they reflected on the intolerable situation , the fiercer grew the flame of their anger , and the more determined the resolution by one master stroke to put an end to their bondage .

		The Chinese Tiger , when roused , is himself reputed to be a formidable beast .

		When he should have been equipped with
Boxer	PERSON	wings , he would be absolutely invincible .

		With this view , and in this hope and confident expectation , was launched such a singular crusade as the weary earth , after nineteen centuries of experience in the Christian era , and we know not how many precedent to that epoch , had never seen before . ''

		Due weight , as a factor in the outbreaks of
1900	DATE	, is assigned to reaction against the ex - tensive reform scheme projected by the young
Emperor Kuang Hsii	PERSON	in
1898	DATE	.

		A pathetic interest attaches to the heroic attempt of the young Manchu ruler to lift his vast empire by main force from the ancient ruts , and to set it in the ways of progress .

		His failure was briefly advertised in the curt announcement -LRB- Sept. .

		28 ,
1898	DATE	-RRB- that
Kuang Hsii	PERSON	had abdicated , and that the redoubtable
Dowager Empress	ORGANIZATION	had once more assumed the government .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	laments that '' There was so little appreciation on the part of Foreign Powers of the nature of the crisis ... The Empire drifted into the whirlpool without the representatives of the leading nations of the West realizing that there was anything unusual in progress , although the connec - tion was of the same sort as that by which a pestilence follows a war .

		The dethronement of
Kuang Hsii	ORGANIZATION	car - ried within itself the fruitful seeds of the Boxer out - break . ''

		Four chapters are devoted to a masterly an - alysis of the causes and progress of the
Boxer	PERSON	movement .

		The Chinese name of this secret society , I Ho Ch ` iian , '' literally denotes the ' Fists ' -LRB- Ch ` iian -RRB- of Righteous -LRB- or Public -RRB- -LRB- I -RRB- Harmony -LRB- Ho -RRB- , in apparent allusion to the strength of united force which was to be put forth .

		As the Chinese phrase ` fists and feet ' signifies ' boxing and wrestling , ' there appeared to be no more suitable term for the adherents of this sect than ' Boxers , ' a desig - nation first used by one or two missionary cor - respondents of foreign journals in
China	LOCATION	, and later universally accepted on account of the difficulty of coining a better one . ''

		And so , after this elaborate introduction , we are led by the author to the heart of his nar - rative , -- the Siege of the Legations in Peking .

		The rest of the first volume and more than half of the second is devoted to the story of those eight weeks of suffering and heroism , which must go back to the siege of the
Lucknow Residency	ORGANIZATION	in
1857	DATE	to find its equal .

		The style , in obedience to the subject , grows more abrupt , and takes on the diary form in the present tense .

		Every feature which made the days terrible and the nights hideous is given its place in this clear and straightforward nar - ration .

		The world knows the outlines well enough ; but Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's story is as vivid as a biograph , and will be eagerly read by all .

		Naturally , we all want to know what so acute an observer and so wise a man as Dr.
Smith	PERSON	thinks will be the outcome ; and so we hasten to the last two chapters , '' A Twelve - month of Foreign Occupation '' and '' The Out - look . ''

		There are plenty of ugly passages in the accounts of loot , outrage , and murder on the part of the allied troops -LRB-
America	LOCATION	's skirts being fairly clean -RRB- , none of which is palliated by the author , who says , '' There have been times when it has seemed as if the foreign troops had come to
Northern China	LOCATION	for the express purpose of committing within the short - est time as many violations as possible of the sixth , the seventh , and the eighth command - ments . ''

		On the other hand , the conduct of the missionaries is justified by so good a judge as Minister Conger '' before the siege , during the siege , and after the siege . ''

		As to the outlook .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	believes that the Chinese will continue in the future , as in the past , to be moved by moral forces as by no others ; and finds the solution in Christianity . ''

		It has been in
China	LOCATION	a disturber , as it always is and always has been everywhere ... There has been much in the method of its propagation in
China	LOCATION	which is open to just criticism , and which at this crucial junc - ture ought to be fearlessly exposed , frankly admitted , and honestly abandoned , new and better methods re - placing those which have proved faulty and unworthy .

		... It is well that the dilemma should be recognized and squarely faced .

		Unless
China	LOCATION	is essentially altered she will continue to * imperil the world 's future . '

		Other forces have been to some extent experimented with , and have been shown to be hopelessly inadequate .


Chris	PERSON	- tianity has been tried upon a small scale only , and has already brought forth fruits after its kind .

		When it shall have been thoroughly tested , and have had oppor - tunity to develop its potentialities , it will give to
China	LOCATION	, intellectually , morally , and spiritually , the elixir of a new life . ''

		40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, Such are the concluding words of this re - markable book .

		They will meet with the assent of many , the rejection of some : but they must command the respect of all who reach them after a careful perusal of the
1600	DATE	pages that precede them .

		And if the editors of that tenth edition of the Encyclopasdia have not as yet '' placed '' their article on
China	LOCATION	, we recom - mend them to assign it to the Rev.
Arthur H. Smith	PERSON	.

		It may be added that the volumes are hand - somely printed and bound , and richly furnished with illustrations , maps , charts , and indices .

		The
Marcus Whitman IjEgend	PERSON	.

		* The story of
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	has passed into history .

		Everyone thinks that he knows how Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	undertook a perilous jour - ney across the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	in the
winter of 1842	DATE	in order to inform the administration at
Washington	LOCATION	of the inroads that the
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay Company were making into
Oregon	LOCATION	; how he exacted promises from President
Tyler	PERSON	and Secretary
Webster	PERSON	not to abandon the terri - tory ; and how , by hurrying back and organ - izing a great emigration , he saved it to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The various versions of this story differ in details , but the burden of them all is that Whitman saved
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		The '' sen - sation '' of the annual meeting of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Detroit	LOCATION	a year ago was a striking paper by Professor
Edward G. Bourne	PERSON	of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, which proved not only that this story is inaccurate in details but that it is entirely unfounded in its main out - lines .

		Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	went east not to save
Oregon	LOCATION	but to save his mission .

		Even if he saw
Webster	PERSON	and
Tyler	PERSON	, there is no reason to think that he changed the policy of the ad - ministration in the slightest degree .

		He did not organize and could not have organized the emigration of
1843	DATE	, but joined it after its organization and rendered valuable assistance on the way .

		Professor
Bourne	PERSON	is not the first to discover the groundlessness of the Whitman story .

		It was pointed out in
Oregon	LOCATION	papers between
1882	DATE	and
1885	DATE	by Mr.
Elwood Evans	PERSON	and by Mrs.
F. F. Victor	PERSON	.

		Mr.

		the subject , and has brought to light much important evidence .

		But Professor
Bourne	PERSON	may fairly be regarded as the
Columbus	LOCATION	of the discovery , since he is the first to succeed in forcing it upon public attention .

		His paper was printed in the
January	DATE	issue of '' The American Historical Review . ''

		It has recently been reprinted in an enlarged and revised form in his '' Essays in Historical Criticism , '' issued as one of the ''
Yale Bicentennial Publications	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In his original paper Professor
Bourne	PERSON	con - tented himself with proving that the Whitman story was without historical foundation .

		In reprinting it he has prefixed another paper in which he traces the origin and genesis of the legend that has been attached to Whitman 's name .

		The story first appeared from
1864	DATE	to
1866	DATE	, nearly twenty years after
Whitman	PERSON	's death , in articles in
California	LOCATION	and
Oregon	LOCATION	papers , originating with
H. H. Spalding	PERSON	and
W. H. Gray	PERSON	, two of Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's associates .

		In the years immediately following his death , when he was most likely to have been eulogized , not a word was heard of his great political services .

		The
Oregon Treaty of 1846	ORGANIZATION	provided for compensation to the
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay and Puget 's Sound Companies for their possessory rights within the territory of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In
1863	DATE	a treaty with
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	provided for the settlement of these claims , and a com - mission , acting under the treaty , began their examination in
1865	DATE	and later awarded | 660 , - 000 to the two companies .

		While this settle - ment was pending , most of the mission land claims were disallowed by the
United States	LOCATION	government on the ground of abandonment .

		These were the circumstances that furnished the motive for the publication of the earliest versions of the Whitman story .

		At about the same time Spalding learned that the govern - ment had printed and circulated as a public document a Catholic account of the Whitman massacre , which reflected upon the conduct of the Protestant missionaries .

		Smarting under the disparagement of his work , the loss of the mission lands , and the fancied injustice of the payment of the foreign claims , Spalding de - voted himself to a campaign of vindication .

		From
1868	DATE	to
1870	DATE	he travelled through
Oregon	LOCATION	and other parts of the
United States	LOCATION	, delivering lectures , collecting endorsements , inspiring newspaper articles , and securing the adoption of resolutions and memorials drafted by himself .

		The burden of these memorials was the great service rendered by Dr.
Whit	PERSON	- man and himself in saving
Oregon	LOCATION	to the
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41
United States	LOCATION	and the justice of the mission land claims , though the latter were discreetly kept in the background .

		The object of these memorials , aside from the repudiation of the Catholic document , may be illustrated by a single extract . ''

		It is our deliberate conviction that the
Lapwai	LOCATION	mis - sion belongs to the
American Board of Foreign Missions	ORGANIZATION	as the mission home of our Brother Spalding ... That the interests of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and of the tribe would be better subserved by the appointment of Mr.
Spalding	PERSON	there than by any other man ... The plea of voluntary abandonment of the
Lapwai	LOCATION	mission ... is simply absurd . ''

		In
1871	DATE	Spalding secured the publication of all of these testimonials , petitions , and papers , as a
Senate	ORGANIZATION	document under the title '' Early Labors of Missionaries in
Oregon	LOCATION	, '' and this document became the principal source of the later versions of the Whitman story .

		In the meantime .

		Gray ,
Spalding	ORGANIZATION	's associate , pub - lished a similar account of Whitman 's services in his `` History of
Oregon	LOCATION	, '' issued in
1870	DATE	.

		Incorporated in a public document and in a formal history of the state , written by an early settler , later writers , without further investi - gation , accepted the story as true .

		At this point began the second propaganda of the story .

		Friends and descendants of the missionaries and the churches that had sent them out were naturally pleased to discover that
Oregon	LOCATION	had been saved to the
United States	LOCATION	by the missions ; and various persons devoted themselves to the diffusion of this im - portant information through the medium of magazine articles , pamphlets , and books .

		The story received its widest circulation in an his - tory of '' Oregon : The Struggle for Posses - sion , '' published by Rev.
Wm. Barrows	PERSON	in
1883	DATE	.

		This book , by reason of its inclusion in a popular series , its issue by a prominent publishing house , and the fact that it presented the only short and convenient account of the
Oregon	LOCATION	controversy , reached a large sale .

		Sev - eral biographies of Whitman were written .

		Two appeared in
1895	DATE	, one of them bearing the striking title '' How Whitman Saved Ore - gon . ''

		In
1897	DATE	the Congregational churches , throughout the country , celebrated the anni - versary of Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's death as '' Whitman Day . ''

		By systematically importuning writers and publishers of school histories of the
United States	LOCATION	to include the story in their text-books , its champions have secured for it practically universal circulation and universal acceptance .

		Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's refutation is complete at every point , and it now remains to correct the perversion of history that has been wrought .

		Dr.
Wm. A. Mowry	PERSON	has been especially con - spicuous by reason of the unusual prominence that he has given to Whitman in the series of school histories of which he is the author .

		Hi '' ''
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	and the
Early Days of Oregon	ORGANIZATION	, '' published during the
summer	DATE	, is the latest and most conservative statement of the Whitman story .

		This book was not hastily undertaken as a reply to Professor
Bourne	PERSON	, but is the result of the careful investigation of many years .

		It is evident , however , that the author is not equipped for critical work in history .

		This conclusion is first suggested by the bib - liography with which the book opens , thrown together as it is without any plan of arrange - ment , misquoting titles , omitting dates of pub - lication , and containing many errors , among which the assignment of the Spalding report to the wrong session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may be men - tioned .

		The first impression is further con - firmed by the author 's treatment of his material .

		He quotes a great deal of personal testimony , but fails to evince any appreciation of the dif - ference in value attaching to testimony taken at different periods , and in many cases omits to indicate the time at which the testimony is taken .

		He is also much given to painting his - torical pictures to fill up the gaps in the narra - tive and to make it interesting , in a way that suggests the Rev.
Mason Weems	PERSON	.

		A single quotation will serve as an example .

		The ex - perience of
Lovejoy	LOCATION	, Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's companion upon his famous ride , is described as follows : '' It was the dead of winter .

		He was one man , alone , in the midst of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, in an unfrequented pass .

		... In his solitude during that longest week of the entire trip , probably the longest of his life , he must have made much of the companionship of their little dog .

		It is sad to think that a little further on in their journey , when their provisions had utterly failed , not only were they obliged to kill a mule for food to save their lives , but stern necessity compelled them to kill and eat that faithful dog . ''

		This picture is apparently based upon Mr.
Lovejoy	PERSON	's statement that they were `` from want of food , compelled to use the flesh of dogs '' mules , and such other animals as came in their reach . ''

		It is hardly worth while to point out the variations contained in Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	's version .

		The important fact is that he applies the same methods to the essential points of the story that he does to the non-essential .

		When he comes to
Whitman	PERSON	's
Washington	LOCATION	visit , he says : '' Exactly what happened in
Washington	LOCATION	is difficult to determine .

		From the best reports we feel quite sure that the following account 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, is not far from the truth . ''

		Then he gives the imaginary conversations with
Webster	PERSON	and
Tyler	PERSON	invented years afterward by
Spalding	LOCATION	, in spite of the fact that there is no direct evidence of Whitman 's having seen
Webster	PERSON	and only very uncertain evidence of his seeing Tyler .

		In place of a careful citation of author - ities , we find such expressions as '' doubtless , '' `` it seems probable , '' '' we are told , '' `` from the best reports we feel quite sure , '' and the like .

		Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	evidently intends to give an im - partial account of the life of Whitman , but is prevented by his preconceived opinions from seeing facts in their true light .

		Nevertheless , he presents much important material ; so that it is quite possible , by making allowance for his constructions , to read the true life of Whit - man in his pages .

		The main points of this life , as already suggested , respect , first , the purpose of his ride , second , the incidents and object of his visit to
Washington	LOCATION	, and , third , his connection with the emigration of
1843	DATE	.

		The
American Board	ORGANIZATION	established its
Oregon	LOCATION	missions in
1836	DATE	by sending out Whitman and Spalding as missionaries and Gray as agent .

		Two years later the missions were reenforced by the addition of
Eells	LOCATION	,
Walker	PERSON	,
Smith	PERSON	, and
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The missionaries quarrelled fiercely among themselves , a fact which Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	passes over as charitably as possible .

		In Feb - ruary of
1842	DATE	the
Prudential Committee of the Board	ORGANIZATION	decided to discontinue the southern branch , transfer Whitman to the northern one , and recall
Spalding	LOCATION	.

		When this order was received in
September	DATE	, Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	, feeling that its execution would be a great mistake , called a meeting of the missionaries , to whom he communicated his resolution to go east im - mediately in order to present his view of the situation to the
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of his journey appears in the authorization of the missionaries , which advised Dr. Whitman '' to visit the
United States	LOCATION	as soon as practicable to confer with the
Committee of the American Board for Foreign Missions	ORGANIZATION	in regard to the interests of this mission . ''

		Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	unac - countably omits the last eight words of this authorization , as Professor
Bourne	PERSON	points out .

		Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's purpose is also clearly stated in a letter written by Mr.
Walker	PERSON	at the time of his departure , which Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	erroneously attributes to Mr.
Eells	PERSON	.

		There is no sugges - tion anywhere of a political motive .

		Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	attributes its absence to fear of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	and of the condemnation of the
American Board	ORGANIZATION	, but these reasons would not have restrained Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	from referring to it in letters written while in the east to per - sons not connected with the
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	also argues that but for a political motive , Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	would have waited until
spring	DATE	, since a
summer	DATE	trip across the continent would have served the purpose of the mission equally well .

		Exactly the reverse appears to us to have been the case .

		The
Board	ORGANIZATION	in
February of 1842	DATE	had ordered the discontinuance of the mission , and would expect the order to be obeyed not later than the
spring of 1843	DATE	.

		If the order were to be withdrawn , representations must reach the
Board	ORGANIZATION	by that time .

		Arriving in
Boston	LOCATION	, Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	succeeded in securing the reversal of the order , and thus accomplished his purpose .

		That Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	also visited
Washington	LOCATION	appears from a letter that he addressed to the Secretary of War after his return to
Oregon	LOCATION	, which began as follows : '' Sir , In compliance with a request you did me the honor to make
last winter	DATE	, while in
Washington	LOCATION	, I herewith transmit to you the synopsis of a bill , '' etc. .

		There is no other contemporary reference to Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's
Washington	LOCATION	visit .

		In later years several persons testified that they re - membered having seen him there .

		Dr.
Lyon G. Tyler	PERSON	writes that
John Tyler , Jr.	PERSON	, President
Tyler	PERSON	's son and secretary , told him that '' he remembered Whitman very well , that he was in
Washington	LOCATION	, 1842-43 , full of his project to carry emigrants to
Oregon	LOCATION	, that he waited on the President and received from him the heartiest concurrence in his plans . ''

		This does not necessarily mean much , since it was the custom of nearly everyone , who visited the national capital , to pay his respects to the President .

		That Dr.
Tyler	PERSON	does not regard it as sustaining the claim that Whitman in - fluenced the administration appears from a recent letter to the writer of this review , in which he says , `` I do not believe that Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	controlled the policy of President
Tyler	PERSON	's administration in any way . ''

		That President
Tyler	PERSON	discussed the political situ - ation with Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	is extremely improb - able , since he had refused the request of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	for information upon the ground that he did '' not deem it consistent with the public interest to make any communication upon the subject . ''

		A very plausible reason for Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's visit to
Washington	LOCATION	and for his interview with the Secretary of War was a de - sire to strengthen the title to the mission lands .

		1902 -RSB- THE DIAL .

		43 These lands were held merely under a permit from the War Department , and Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	expressed his anxiety upon the subject in his first letter , written to the
American Board	ORGANIZATION	after his return to
Oregon	LOCATION	, in which he said , '' Un - less the
Board	ORGANIZATION	gets a special grant of the land the mission occupies , it will be likely to be taken from the mission by preemption when - ever
Congress	ORGANIZATION	takes possession of the country and grants land to settlers . ''

		As to
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's connection with the emi - gration of
1843	DATE	, Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	admits that '' it can be clearly shown that he was not the sole cause of this great westward movement , '' but he endeavors to show that he was one of its prime movers .

		In regard to this emigration Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	on his way back to
Oregon	LOCATION	wrote the Secretary of the
American Board	ORGANIZATION	from
Shawnee	LOCATION	Mission : '' You will be surprised to see that we are not yet started .

		The emigrants have some of them just gone and some of them have been gone a week and some are yet coming on .

		I shall start to-morrow .

		I regret that I could not have spent some of the time spent here in suspense , with my friends at the
East	LOCATION	.

		... I can not give you much of an account of the emigrants until we get on the road .

		It is said that there are over two hun - dred men besides women and children .

		They look like a fair representative of a country population .

		Few , I conclude , are pious ... We do not ask you to be the patrons of emigration to
Oregon	LOCATION	, but we ask you to use your influence that , in connection with all the influx into the country , there may be a fair proportion of good men of our own denomination who shall avail themselves of the advantages of the country in common with others . ''

		From this letter it appears that Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	was not only not engrossed with the organization of a great emigration , but that he regretted the time he was compelled to spend with it , and was almost disgusted with its character .

		What Whitman 's real plan of emigration was appears very clearly in the documents that Dr.
Mowry	PERSON	presents .

		It is stated in the letter , already cited , written by Mr.
Walker	PERSON	, just as Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	was leaving for the east , and repeated in the partial sanction that was given it by the
American Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	himself states it in his letter to the
Board	ORGANIZATION	written immediately after his return to
Oregon	LOCATION	, and again in letters written shortly before his death in
1847	DATE	.

		In all of these statements the emigration was regarded solely from the standpoint of the missions , and not at all from the standpoint of American interest in the territory ; a fact wholly inconsistent with the theory that
Whitman	PERSON	was so devoted to the national interests that he undertook his winter journey to secure them .

		What Whitman wanted was a small emigration of pious people to assist the missions in checking the papists , and not the great emigration of all sorts and conditions of men that saved
Oregon	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		No one man saved
Oregon	LOCATION	, but the spontaneous movement of masses of men .

		It was a part of that larger movement which , beginning with the
Allegheny Mountains	LOCATION	, in little more than a century pushed the American frontier across the continent to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and afforded the most marvellous example of na - tional expansion in all history .

		In that struggle
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	played a man 's part , and , like hundreds of others , fell a victim to Indian treachery ; but that he is entitled , either by the breadth of his views or by the measure of his achievement , to rank as one of the leaders of the struggle can not for a moment be ad - inJtted .

Mary Stuart	PERSON	and the `` Casket IiETters . ''

		* One who has been following Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's literary activities for the last few years will recognize in his '' Pickle the Spy '' and '' The Companions of Pickle , '' as well as in his more recent volume on '' The Mystery of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, '' the by-products of the author 's '' His - tory of
Scotland	LOCATION	, '' recently brought to a con - clusion .

		Or , if this designation has a derogatory shade , it might be fairer to refer to the books first named as the results of the author 's pre - liminary studies for the latter .

		It would be difficult on any other assumption to understand how Mr.
Lang	PERSON	should have been inclined to devote such minute study , and two impressive volumes , to
Pickle	ORGANIZATION	and
Pickle	ORGANIZATION	's companions .

		But the same wonder would not be felt regard - ing an extended study of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	.

		As with her personality in life , so with her memory and the problems surrounding her career and her fate : the charm is perennial .

		The most serious charges against the char - acter of the Scottish queen are involved in the partial or complete authenticity of what are known as the '' Casket Letters , '' a series of eight epistles which first came to light in the hands of
Balfour	LOCATION	,
Morton	PERSON	, and other Scotch lords hostile to
Mary	PERSON	, on the
19th of June	DATE	, four days after the so-called battle of
Carberry Hill	LOCATION	, where
Mary	PERSON	was taken captive by her *

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, banded subjects .

		When produced , the letters were in a trunk-shaped box less than a foot long , adorned with gold metal filagree .

		These letters , the originals of which disappeared soon after their production before the English Com - missioners who were examining the charges against
Mary	PERSON	, in
December , 1568	DATE	, were appar - ently without address , date , or signature .

		Mor - ton testified that the casket was taken by
George Douglas	PERSON	from
Dalgleish	PERSON	, a valet of
Bothwell	ORGANIZATION	's , who revealed its existence and hiding-place under torture .

		Dalgleish had come into
Edin	PERSON	- burgh a few days before
June 19 , 1567	DATE	.

		Douglas and
Dalgleish	PERSON	then took the casket to
Morton	PERSON	, who kept it in his sole possession until next day , the 21st , and then opened it in the presence of various lords .

		No inventory was made of the contents of the casket , the docu - ments were not marked , and no minute was made of the character of the contents , although the assembled lords -- all hostile to
Mary	PERSON	, and some of them privy to the murder of
Darnley	LOCATION	, others to the murder of
Riccio	PERSON	-- recognized the letters as damaging to
Mary	PERSON	.

		After this examination , the letters were returned to the custody of
Morton	PERSON	, who produced them eight - een months later before the English Commis - sioners and declared that he had not altered them .

		Moray , who conducted the case against
Mary	PERSON	, required the papers to be re-delivered to
Morton	PERSON	, various copies and translations hav - ing been taken .


Morton	PERSON	had possession of the casket -LRB- with the letters in it ? -RRB-

		not long before his death in
1581	DATE	; it was heard of for a few years longer , and then disappeared from sight forever .

		The supposed originals were never collated or examined critically by unprejudiced ^ experts , and their presentation before a com - mission when
Mary	PERSON	was not present , either in person or by counsel , gives them no real value as evidence that would stand before a civilized court .

		The only form in which the letters exist to - day is that of copies or translations , none of which are duly certified as true copies .

		This throws the whole burden of the proof upon the internal evidence of the compositions , and this is vitiated by the fact that the alleged original letters were produced from no one knows where , by a mortal enemy of
Mary	PERSON	, himself a murderer and unscrupulous perjurer ; and were , even after their production , left for months in his irresponsible keeping .

		After a minute and ingenious examination of this internal evidence , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	inclines to the opinion that Letter II. , the most compro - mising of them all , is probably partly or alto - gether a forgery , although there remain circum - stances indicating the authenticity of parts of it .

		This letter , if admitted as genuine , would prove
Mary	PERSON	's connivance at the murder of
Darnley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Letters IV.-VIII .

		testify more or less clearly to
Mary	PERSON	's amour with
Bothwell	PERSON	, and to her connivance in her own abduction and marriage with him .

		The authenticity of these letters Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is less disposed to ques - tion , although he concedes the possibility that all of the eight are forged .

		If any forgery was committed in connection with the letters , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	inclines to lay it upon Lethington , whose duplicity and motives for such action he shows forth at length .

		The '' Casket Sonnets , '' sometimes called Letter IX. , are treated very summarily , ap - parently because '' a distinguished historian is occupied with a critical edition '' of them .

		The suggestion that the letters , if forgeries , are based upon the sonnets ; that the sonnets were the original documents found in the casket ; and that their tone and style were developed into the letters , with the addition of more in - criminating details by the hostile lords , deserved a more extended discussion .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	regards the sonnets as much less open to suspicion of forgery than the letters , and at the same time finds a decided similarity between them , even to the phraseology .

		He even admits that the suspicion we have mentioned '' is suggested . ''

		On the whole , the chapters devoted to the discussion of the '' Casket Letters '' succeed admirably in impressing the reader with the general untrustworthiness of all the people who surrounded
Mary	PERSON	, friend or foe .

		In this maze of intrigue , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	sets himself the problem of figuring out the probabilities of truth .

		He admits us to his study , and invites us to listen while he thinks aloud .

		He weighs this evidence , and rejects it ; he considers that testimony , and admits that there may be something to it , provided -- ; he conjectures , he balances , he puts himself in the place of both accusers and defenders , he wrestles with the calculus of probabilities , until at last '' We feel as stupid from all of that As though we 'd a mill-wheel under our hat , '' And the author himself is not far from coming out '' at the same door where in he went , '' -- to wit , that
Mary	PERSON	was more or less guilty , but not so guilty as her enemies have said ; and that her accusers are at least as bad as she .

		In the opening chapters , describing '' The
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 Dramatis Personae , '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is at his best .

		Here we find once more the literary artist who was buried under the rubbish of '' Pickle the Spy . ''

		It would be greatly desirable to have an entire biography of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	completed in the style and the manner of these opening chapters .

		For instance , this description of the Earl of Morton : '' The son of the most accomplished and perfidious scoundrel of the past generation , Sir
George Douglas	PERSON	, brother of Angus the brother-in-law of
Henry VIII.	ORGANIZATION	,
Morton	PERSON	had treachery in his blood .

		His father had alternately betrayed
England	LOCATION	, of which he was a pen - sioner , and
Scotland	LOCATION	, of which he was a subject .

		By a perverse ingenuity of shame , he had used the sacred
Douglas	PERSON	heart , the cognizance of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, the achievement granted to the descendants of Good
Lord James	PERSON	, as a mark to indicate what passages in his trea - sonable letters might be relied on by his English em - ployers .

		In
Morton	PERSON	's father and uncle had lived on the ancient inappeasable feud between Douglases and Stewarts , between the
Nobles	PERSON	and the Crown .

		It was a feud stained by murder under trust , by betrayal in the field and perfidy in the closet .


Morton	PERSON	was heir to the feud of his family , and to the falseness ... His sanctimonious snuffle is audible still in his remark to
Throckmorton	LOCATION	, who asked to be allowed to see
Mary	ORGANIZATION	in prison .

		Morton answered that ' the day being destined to the
Communion	ORGANIZATION	, continual preaching , and common prayer , they could not be absent , nor attend matters of the world . '

		... A red-handed murderer , living in open adultery with the widow of Captain
Cullen	PERSON	whom he had hanged , and daily consorting with murderers like his kinsman
Archibald Douglas	PERSON	,
Morton	PERSON	approached the Divine Mysteries .

		His private life was notoriously profligate ; he added avarice to his other and more genial peccadilloes . ''

		The fine plates with which this volume is liberally supplied add much to the author 's ability to make the past re-live .

		But inasmuch as there is not in existence a copy of the '' Casket Letters '' in
Mary	PERSON	's own hand , it is not quite evident why the discussion is accom - panied with plates showing her authentic writ - ing , with a fac simile of the MS. of the '' Casket Sonnets '' which are not in
Mary	PERSON	's hand , and a plate by a writing expert showing how Letter III .

		would look in
Mary	ORGANIZATION	's hand .

		A LITTLE book entitled '' How to Remember without Memory Systems or with Them '' -LRB-
F. Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Eustace H. Miles	PERSON	, is a saner book than most that deal with this topic .

		Though it contains a fair statement of the psychology of memory and rational chapters of advice , it does not rise sufficiently , either by originality or excellence of execution , above the average of its class to call for extended remark .

		Strivings with Social , Problems , * One of the most imj -RRB- ortant of the recent contri - butions to our knowledge of society is Professor
Ross	PERSON	's treatise on '' Social Control . ''

		It is a fuller working out of the thoughts suggested in the author 's articles published in the '' American Journal of Sociology '' during recent years .

		Since then , he has had excellent opportunity to observe the work - ing of a system of control in vogue in
California	LOCATION	, and has made extensive studies in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		His particular field of investigation has been among the Western European peoples and their descend - ants in
America	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	.

		Among these most restless and individualistic of men he seeks to dis - cover the secret of '' that degree of harmony we see about us . ''

		In general , this harmony is a fabric erect - ed by the community and imposed upon the individ - ual .

		But individuals are characterized by certain qualities of adaptation to society .

		The first chapters are given to the consideration of these qualities , under the titles Sympathy , Sociability ,
Sense of Justice	ORGANIZATION	, and Resentment .

		Under favorable circum - stances , these qualities may produce a '' natural order . ''

		But this is far from perfect , and in course of time '' society invariably developes a certain measure of control over the individual . ''

		The need of control is shown by illustrations of life in new settlements , and its methods are discussed under such titles as `` Public Opinion , '' `` Law , '' `` Social Suggestion , '' '' Art , '' '' Illusions , '' etc. .

		Social con - trol is liable to abuses , such as being used in the interests of a class ; and even when properly directed , it must be within reasonable limits , for '' the art of domesticating human beings may succeed only too well . ''

		The third of the studies undertaken by the Com - mittee of Fifty for the Investigation of the Liquor Problem appears under the title '' Substitutes for the Saloon . ''

		It is written by Mr.
Raymond Cal	PERSON	- kins , and is the most satisfactory of the three , in that it deals with more complex questions and a • Social Control .

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, greater mass of material , by a logical method and in a lucid style .

		The references to the numerous preliminary studies made in different cities , as a basis for the work , and the extracts from their re - ports , convince one of the care with which the foundation has been laid .

		The book is a mine of information in regard to various lines of philan - thropic work .

		But , better than that , the material is so handled that one finds it most interesting reading as well as a convenient book of reference .

		And , best of all , one is impressed by the author 's keen insight into the real significance of these agencies of betterment , and his appreciation of the reasons for their incomplete success .

		The first and third chapters , entitled '' The Saloon as a Social Centre '' and < ' The Clubs of the People , '' are par - ticularly valuable as showing what the saloon really is to the great bulk of its patrons .

		One feels himself in the place of the man at the bar , and is therefore in the best position to realize the practical value of the various '' substitutes '' that have been pro- posed .

		This book is a necessity to all rational temperance workers ; indeed , it is difl & cult to see how anyone interested in the betterment of society can afford to be without it .

		In '' The Science of Penology , '' Mr.
Henry M. Boies	PERSON	has collated and systemized the modern doctrines pertaining to this subject .

		The author 's official position has made it his duty to study care - fully the problems of crime and pauperism , and with this book he has filled a serious gap in our literature in these fields .

		Most of the recent pub - lications have been more or less fragmentary studies of the criminal 's nature .

		These have had their important influence in modifying the science , and now Mr.
Boies	PERSON	gives us an excellent statement of its present position .

		The book ought to be of great value to all connected with prison administration , and it will certainly be valuable in college and uni - versity work . ''

		The World of Graft '' is a collection of studies of the professional thief and swindler in his relation to government , some of which have appeared from time to time in ''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- lard has been criticised for his persistent '' spying upon the unfortunate , '' but in this book it is less the unfortunate and more the rogue that is studied . ''

		Graft '' is defined as the '' generic slang term for all kinds of theft and illegal practices generally . ''

		The grafter '' may be a political boss , a mayor , a chief of police , a warden of a penitentiary , a mu - nicipal contractor , a member of a town council , etc. '' It is this contingency that complicates municipal administration .

		The public sometimes sets a rogue to watch a rogue , and each preys upon the other and both upon the public .

		The evidence as to this condition is especially clear in the cases of
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, where the author 's statements seem to have been somewhat irritating to the police .

		Another attempt to solve the problems growing out of over-crowding in cities appears in '' Back to the Soil , '' by Mr.
Bradley Gilman	PERSON	.

		A group of wealthy men become interested in an attempt to found a farm colony that shall possess all the ad - vantages of city life without its evils .

		A tract of land four miles square is obtained , and divided in such a way that all the houses mav be built in a circle about a central park and within a few rods of each other .

		With difficulty , families are induced to come from the city slums , and various industries are established , including a market in the great city for the sale of
Circle City	ORGANIZATION	products .

		This , it is thought , disposes of the industrial and economic questions ; but the task of educating and socializing the people is more difficult to handle .

		Thoughts will intrude of our thousands of country villages with all the economic advantages of
Circle City	LOCATION	, and nothing more .

		`` Tolstoy and his Problems '' is the title of a series of essays by
Aylmer Maude	PERSON	, bearing upon
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's personality and theories , and upon the South African war .

		The author has enjoyed inti - mate friendship with
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and many of the incidents of his daily life and his comments upon fellow-reformers are of interest .

		The tactical value of the doctrine of non-resistance seems to make it especially attractive to the author , as it gives him a fine advantage over the English government and the war Quakers .

		In '' Social Institutions '' Mr.
Denton J. Snider	PERSON	rounds out his work in psychology with an inter - pretation of the institutions of society in the terms of the
Hegelian School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though the book is diffi - cult reading , the author hopes to render it '' intelli - gible to any reader who is willing to think a little . ''

		This requires , however , '' a given nomenclature which indicates in the word the connecting thought , '' and the exposition '' of this nomenclature occupies forty pages of the Introduction .

		The definition of institution is important : '' Will is actualized in an object which is itself Will , and this is a Will which wills Will .

		Such an object which is existent in the World as Will , whose end and purpose is to secure Will , is an institution . ''

		In `` A Day with a Tramp , and Other Days , '' Mr.
Walter A. Wyckoff	PERSON	yields to the public clamor for more stories about the American workman , by filling in a few of the gaps in his published diary .

		The remarkable reception of '' ■ The Workers '' fully warrants the publication of this appendix .

		It is written in the same vivid style , and will make its readers still more eager to hear what the author has to say about his recent investigations in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The appearance of the second edition of Pro- fessor
Henderson	PERSON	's '' Social Spirit in
America	LOCATION	'' may well serve as an occasion for congratulating the reading public upon its appreciation of this work .

		We have no wiser or more kindly leader in social betterment than the author , and certainly such a book is one of the strongest forces that make for justice and improvement in society .

		THE
DIAL 47 Recent American Poetry	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In its recent bicentennial celebration ,
Yale Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity was fortunate in more ways than one , but in no way more fortunate than in numbering among its sons the foremost of our living poets .

		It was preordained in the fitness of things that Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	should be the poet of the occa - sion , and that he should respond to the call with an ode entirely worthy of himself and of his alma mater .

		The '' Mater Coronata , '' recited by him last
October	DATE	at
New Haven	LOCATION	, is a poem dignified and severe almost to the point of bareness .

		It is un - adorned by the minor rhetorical graces , but it is weighty with thought and the burden of the highest ideals of the spirit .

		Two stanzas occurring midway in the poem may be taken to represent the quality of the whole . ''

		No oracle betokened the obscure Grim years encountering which the elders bowed , Yet know not faintness nor discomfiture , But set the buttress sure That should upstay these tabernacles proud ; '' These fanes , that bred their patriot to vie In steadfastness , erect of thought to live , Or , when the country bade , undauntedly Without lament to die Save that he had but one young life to give . ''

		There are twenty-seven of these stanzas in all , * Mater Coronata .

		logically knit together for the unfolding of their high argument .

		Another of the small volumes of verse that are collected every few years by Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	has just been published with the title , '' Poems and Inscriptions . ''

		The poems are mostly occasional , reminiscences of consecrated places , and tributes to great men , such , for example , as the piece inscribed to
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and suggested by a visit to the house of the composer in
Vienna	LOCATION	. ''

		Here unto the bitter end abode He who from pain wrought noble joy for men .

		He who from silence gave the world to song ; For in his mind an awful music rose As when , in darkness of the under-seas .

		Currents tremendous over currents pour .

		He heard the soundless tone , its voice he was , And he of vast humanity the voice , And his the empire of the human soul . ''

		The '' Inscriptions '' of this volume were written for the buildings of the
Pan-American Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, and are conceived in the spirit of a fine literary art .

		The last of them is '' To the statesmen , philosophers , teachers , and preachers , and to all those who , in the new world , have upheld the ideals of liberty and justice , and have been faithful to the things that are eternal . ''

		Among the poets of the younger generation in this country there are not more than three or four whose achievement reaches the level of Mr.
George Santayana	PERSON	's work .

		In his new volume , '' A Hermit of
Carmel	LOCATION	, and Other Poems , '' he displays his varied gifts -- melody and mysticism , passion and philosophy -- in ampler measure than hitherto , and wins the respect of all lovers of serious poetry .

		For the title-poem and its sequel , dramatic in form rather than in treatment , we care less than for the lyrical numbers that follow .

		Of these , the very first strikes the philosophical note most characteristic of Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	's work .

		The verse is of the brooding sort , with a haunting and melancholy sweetness all its own .

		The poem is called '' Premonition . '' ''

		The mnffled syllables that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	speaks Fill us with deeper longing for her word ; She hides a meaning that the spirit seeks .

		She makes a sweeter music than is heard . ''

		A hidden light illumines all our seeing .

		An unknown lore enchants our solitude .

		We feel and know that from the depths of being Exhales an infinite , a perfect good . ''

		Though the heart wear the garment of its sorrow And be not happy like a naked star .

		Yet from the thought of peace some peace we borrow .

		Some rapture from the rapture felt afar . ''

		Our heartstrings are too coarse for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's fingers To wake her purest melodies upon .

		And the harsh tremor that among them lingers Will into sweeter silence die anon . ''

		We catch the broken prelude and suggestion Of things unuttered , needing to be sung ; We know the burden of them , and their question Lies heavy on the heart , nor finds a tongue . ''

		Till haply , lightning through the storm of ages , Our sullen secret flash from sky to sky , Glowing in some diviner poet 's pages And swelling into rapture from this sigh . ''

		48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, A sheaf of translations comes next after the lyrical section of the volame , and includes examples of
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	, Musset , and
Gautier	PERSON	.

		Greatly dar - ing , hut justified of his venture , Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	has translated
Gautier	PERSON	's marvellous poem , '' L'Art . ''

		We had thought that the paraphrase of Mr.
Dob	PERSON	- son 's '' Ars Victrix '' was the best that could be hoped for as a version of this poem in English , but Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	has given us a true translation , so nearly perfect that we are lost in admiration of his skill .

		We must quote the last part of this tour de force , wishing that we had space for the whole . ''

		Show in their triple lobe Virgin and Child , that hold Their globe Cross - crowned and aureoled . ''

		-- All things return to dust Save beauties fashioned well .

		The bust Outlasts the citadel . ''

		Oft doth the ploughman 's heel .

		Breaking an ancient clod .

		Reveal A Csesar or a god .

		`` The gods , too , die , alas !

		But deathless and more strong Than brass Remains the sovereign song . ''

		Chisel and carve and file , Till the vague dream imprint Its smile On the unyielding flint . ''

		Translation can do nothing better than this , which must always stand as one of the supreme achieve - ments of its kind .

		Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	's section of '' Convivial and Occasional Verses '' reveals the poet in a new character .

		His touch is not quite light enough for felicity in this manner , but we have read with a good deal of satisfaction the story of '' Young
Sammy	PERSON	's First Wild Oats . ''

		The theme may be gathered from these remarks of the Deacon to the Doctor -- '' Cousin
Sammy	PERSON	's gone a-tooting To the
Creole County	LOCATION	fair .

		Where the very sun 's polluting And there 's fever in the air .

		He has picked up three young lasses , Three mulattoes on the mart , Who have offered him free passes To their fortune and their heart .

		One young woman he respected , Vowed he only came to woo .

		But his word may be neglected Since he ravished the other two . ''

		These , be it observed , are the antics of young
Sammy	PERSON	, and there is a world of meaning in what follows : '' Now he looks on outraged faces And can laugh , defying God : He can stretch his hand , relieving .

		And strike down a cheated slave .

		Oh , if
Uncle Sam	LOCATION	were living .

		This would bring him to his grave I '' This excellent fooling serves , as it were , to usher in the noble poem called ''
Spain	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, '' which occupies the penultimate place in the volume .

		It is a philosophical panorama of the historical fortunes of
Spain	LOCATION	in both the old world and the new , and in it the Spanish blood of the author finds expression in many proud imaginings . ''

		By sloth and lust and mindlessness and pelf
Spain	LOCATION	sank in sadness and dishonour down , Each in her service serving but himself .

		Each in his passion striking at her crown .

		Not that these treasons blotted her renown Emblazoned higher than such hands can reach : There where she reaped but sorrow she has sown The balm of sorrow ; all she had to teach She taught the younger world -- her faith and heart and speech . ''

		And now within her sea-girt walls withdrawn She waits in silence for the healing years .

		While where her sun has set another dawn Comes from the north , with other hopes and fears .


Spain	LOCATION	's daughters stand , half ceasing from their tears .

		And watch the skies from
Cuba	LOCATION	to the Horn . '

		What is this dove or eagle that appears , ' They seem to cry , ' what herald of what morn Hovers o'er Andes ' peaks in love or guile or scorn ? ' ''

		A characterization of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	opens the new volume of poems by Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	.

		It yields such fine verses as these : '' The color of the ground was in him , the red earth ; The tang and odor of the primal things -- The rectitude and patience of the rocks ; The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn ; The courage of the bird that dares the sea ; The justice of the rain that loves all leaves ; The pity of the snow that hides all scars ; The loving-kindness of the wayside well ; The tolerance and equity of light That gives as freely to the shrinking weed As to the great oak flaring to the wind -- To the grave 's low hill as to the Matterhom That shoulders out the sky . ''

		The ring of these lines is rather rhetorical than poetical , and this we find true of most of Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's work .

		He is so moved by social passion , and so eager to proclaim the gospel of human brotherhood that he confuses the boundary line be - tween the sermon and the song . ''

		What do we need to keep the nation whole .

		To guard the pillars of the
State	ORGANIZATION	?

		We need The fine audacities of honest deed ; The homely old integrities of soul ; The swift temerities that take the part Of outcast right -- the wisdom of the heart ; Brave hopes that Mammon never can detain , Nor sully with his gainless clutch for gain . ''

		Admirable doctrine , no doubt , but not exactly poetry .

		When preaching becomes prophecy , we get much the same thing . ''

		Be constellated , star by circling star ; Give to all mortals justice and forgive : License must die that liberty may live .

		Let Love shine through the fabric of the
State	ORGANIZATION	-- Love deathless , Love whose other name is Fate .

		Fear not , we can not fail -- The Vision will prevail .

		Truth is the
Oath of God	ORGANIZATION	, and , sure and fast , Through Death and
Hell	ORGANIZATION	holds onward to the last . ''

		In two of these poems , '' The Angelas '' and '' The Sower , '' Mr.
Markham	PERSON	turns to the inspiration that gave him the best-known of his pieces .

		This is from '' The Sower '' :
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 '' Not his the lurching of an aimless clod .

		For with the
august	DATE	gesture of a god -- A gesture that is question and command -- He hurls the bread of nations from his band ; And in the passion of the gesture flings His fierce resentment in the face of kings . ''

		We much doubt if the sower does anything of this sort .

		But the poetry of his act was once expressed by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	in lines of which Mr.
Markham	PERSON	gives us only a faint echo . ''

		Pendant que , d ^ ployant ses voiles , L'ombre , oil se roSle une rnmeur , Semble 6largir jusqu'aux ^ toiles Le geste auguste du semeur , '' We are impelled to a closing comment by Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's line -- '' The shy arbutus glimmers in the wood . ''

		We do not wish to be hypercritical , but a poet is bound to look to his accents , and the word '' arbu - tus '' has been greatly abused .

		Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	speaks scornfully of the man who is not ashamed to be ignorant of the Eustachian tubes , but who would blush if caught saying '' Iphig ^ nia . ''

		Now for such a man we should feel sympathy rather than scorn .

		One can be well-educated without knowing anything of the Eustachian tubes , but ignorance concerning the pronunciation of `` Iphig ^ nia '' betokens a vital defect of culture .

		Mr.
Clinton ScoUard	PERSON	is a poet who needs no in - troduction ; his eight volumes of verse have already secured for him a high place among our writers of taste and refinement .

		A ninth volume is `` The Lutes of Morn , '' beautifully printed in a private and limited edition . ''

		Hold them , I pray you , not in niter scorn .

		These broken echoes of the Lutes of Morn ! ''

		he adjures his readers , with greater modesty than is needful .

		The volume contains ballads , lyrics , and sonnets , all upon Oriental themes , marked by rich coloring and graceful diction .

		`` Orchards stretch their bloomy span Round the walls of
Hamadan	LOCATION	; Purples deepen on the grape ; Lyric brooks make blithe escape ; Yet are all the glories gone That the lord of
Macedon Saw	ORGANIZATION	, ere drew the orgy on .

		And the Bacchic revel ran Round the walls of
Hamadan	LOCATION	. ''

		This is the kind of verse that Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	used to give us , with more , perhaps , of fancy , but less of actuality , in the days when he was still a man of letters .

		We must quote in full Mr.
ScoUard	PERSON	's verses , `` By the Waters of
Galilee	LOCATION	. ''

		`` The wind is low in the oleanders , Softly stirring the rosy sea ; Oat from the hill a rill meanders Down to the waters of
Galilee	LOCATION	.

		`` A burning blazon of blue enamels The rainless heaven that arches o'er ; And Druses drowse by their crouching camels .

		Where meadows dip to the shingly shore .

		* ' Grumbling walls that the hyssop clings to , Such is
Magdala	LOCATION	's glory now ; And the only ear that the cuckoo sings to Is that of the mate on the carol bongh . ''

		The columned city that
Herod	PERSON	fashioned .

		That glistened white in the noonday blaze , Naught is left of its past impassioned Save ghosts that wander its squalid ways .

		`` Never a sail nor a galley oaring The shimmering reaches of liquid calm ; Only a watchful vulture soaring Over the crest of a lonely palm .

		`` But still the mountains , violet , vernal , And the brooding vales where the shepherds be , And the sun , in its equipoise eternal , Looking down upon
Galilee	LOCATION	. ''

		And ever , to halo the desert places .

		By the spell of the girdling silence bound .

		The haunting thought of the face of faces .

		Of Him through whom this is holy ground . ''

		From the lute to the violin is a natural transition , and so we come next to Mr.
Alfred L. Donaldson	PERSON	's volume .

		These '' Songs of My Violin '' are intro - duced by a '' Prelude '' that takes our thought back to the old instruments and their makers .

		`` For , as the sea-shells found along the shore Retain the echoes of the ocean 's roar And murmur with the music of the spheres -- So are old violins inlaid with song Distilled of memories that throb and throng Athwart their dream-life of a thousand years . ''

		To each string of the violin the writer 's fancy has assigned a characteristic color , G being silver , D red , A white , and E gold .

		Then the spirit of each string announces its own character , and at once breaks into song .

		Thus the E string , heralded very properly by an excerpt from the '' Rheingold , '' in - spires the ifollowing verses : '' From a golden isle , in the sunset sea , I bring a golden gift for thee .

		In the wondrous island a fairy dwells , Where earthly sighs are asphodels .

		At a spinning-wheel , spinning all day long , She weaves the sunshine into song .

		And she spins it straight into magic strings For harps through which the zephyr sings When it sighs through heaven the hour of rest -- The mild-voiced curfew of the
West	LOCATION	.

		One of these she sends as a gift for thee ; A golden , sunbeam-woven ' E ' I '' A few '' Stray Songs and Sonnets , '' upon musical and other themes , complete the contents of this col - lection .

		We are a little startled by the symbolism of '' Begotten ` neath the sign of three glad sharps , From its blue cradle in the Key of A , The firstling chord is weaned and launched in air , '' but the author assures us that his arbitrary as - sumptions have no serious philosophy underlying them .

		The Bishop of
Peoria	LOCATION	has a deserved reputation as a writer of graceful and scholarly essays , uphold - ing the highest ideals of thought and conduct ; but as a poet he is less widely known .

		His volume entitled '' God and the Soul '' is a sonnet-sequence of the spiritual life , divided into four books , each of which is prefaced by three or four lyrical preludes .

		A characteristic sonnet , fairly representative of its nearly two hundred fellows , is the one called '' Transformation . ''

		Uhrnry , -RRB- 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, '' When throagh long years we watch the setting sun , As day by day he passes from our sight , Leaving repose and blessings of the
night	TIME	, Sweet as the rest that comes when work is done .

		Peaceful as heart of meditative nun .

		Our souls are dyed in the soft , sober light .

		Until they glow like Alpine mountain height Bathed in rich hues , when night all else has won .

		`` So they , whose thought to God is ever near , Qrow like Him , luminous , pure , and serene .

		They live in worlds where all is calm and clear As cloudless skies and windless streams between .

		They walk the solemn shores of time , and hear The waves break on eternal shores unseen . ''

		This elevation of soul is maintained -- no mean achievement -- throughout the entire series of
Bishop Spalding	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets .

		They are open to the complaint of diffuseness , of uneven execution , and of a too facile diction , but their spirituality is unfailing , and they must take a high place in the class of religious and meditative verse to which they belong .

		They seem to us quite as good , for example , as the poems of '' The Christian Year . ''

		`` The Feast of Thalarchus , '' by Mr.
Cond ^ Benoist Fallen	PERSON	, is a dramatic poem of the early days of Christianity .

		Thalarchus , feasting with his sensual crew at
Antioch	LOCATION	, is vouchsafed a vision of
Simeon	PERSON	upon his pillar , beset by the demons who strive to possess the soul of the saint .

		The spectacle moves Thalarchus to the depths of his soul , and , as one in a trance , he beseeches
Simeon	PERSON	to pray for him , the companions of his orgy meanwhile regard - ing him with mingled wonder and amusement .

		The devotion of Simeon avails both to repulse the de - mons and to reclaim the soul of Thalarchus , who , awakening from his stupor , proclaims his conver - sion .

		There are both poor and good verses in this poem .

		For the former we may take the lines : '' Daintiest meats unknown In this our Antioch before , to spur The jaded appetites of ancient revellers ; Succulent dishes dressed by so rare art That sated gluttons shall hunger at the sight ; Such subtle witcheries for eye and ear That they shall swoon with giddy surfeit ; Beauty So prodigal of all her charms that
Venus	PERSON	' Self would stale upon the general eye . ''

		As an offset to this specimen of slovenly workman - ship , we will select a passage from
Simeon	PERSON	's song of praise . ''

		And so the whole round world And the respondent heavens , O Lord , utter Thy glory and make manifest thy praise !

		For thine the gentle silence of the
night	TIME	, And thine the softness of the balmy air , And thine the sweet refreshment of repose And strength renewed in man and beast and fowl ; And thine the glory of the golden moon , And all the splendour of the rising sun Shedding the benediction of its light Upon the waking world . ''

		By way of contrast to the unrelieved seriousness of the two volumes just noticed , we now take up two volumes of verse in lighter vein .

		Mr.
Charles Henry Webb	PERSON	's '' With Lead and Line along Vary - ing Shores '' is a worthy successor to his '' Vagrom Verse '' of a dozen years ago .

		It is a warm-hearted book of wit and tenderness , of unpretentious effort and genuine feeling .

		Here is a specimen fragment : '' Of all the ages ever known , Of Brass or Bronze , of Brick or Stone , The blackest and the worst , I think .

		Is this pestiferous Age of Ink .

		In volume vast the torrent pours .

		Its volumes blocking all outdoors ; And fed and fattened as it flows With verses scanned and potted prose .

		Though all would dam it , -- and some do , -- The Deluge still is apres nous .

		^ ^ Most of these pieces are personal or occasional , and their felicitous lightness of touch may.be well illus - trated by the closing stanzas of the tribute paid to Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	a year ago , when the veteran poet was the guest of honor at the Authors ' Club . ''

		Yet if one have a catboat , dear , Instead of a balloon , Without some friendly slant of wind One can not make the moon .

		So , while all other brows and ears With laurel thou dost twine .

		Although they be less prominent , Oh , please remember mine . ''

		And I will drink , when I get where There 's something fit to drink , Instead of stuff as thin as though Each author brought his ink -- A cup to him who from his heart
Pours Poesy	ORGANIZATION	's choicest wine .

		And as a critic never wrote Or thought -- one unkind line . ''

		Our second volume of fanciful and sentimental verse is Mr.
Ray Clarke Rose	PERSON	's '' At the Sign of the Ginger Jar '' -- a title that will be familiar to readers of a certain
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper , in whose columns many of these pieces first saw the light .

		Their merit is much above the average of news - paper poetry , and the approved masters of vers de sociSti might have been glad to sign them .

		A pretty trifle is '' Dolly in the Rain . '' ''

		When Dolly tiptoed in the rain The shameless sun peeped out to see -- Well , certain charming things were plain When Dolly tiptoed in the rain !

		I peeped out too , but with disdain The saucy maiden glanced at me .

		When Dolly tiptoed in the rain The shameless sun peeped out to see . ''

		No less dainty , but a shade more serious , are the two quatrains called `` Star Tracks . '' ''

		Alone in bed at night I lie And watch the stars that dot the sky ; They are so yellow and so bright I call them daisies of the night . ''

		When day returns I step abroad To view the wondrous works of God , And yellow daisies , as I pass , Shine out like stars upon the grass . ''

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	has produced a very charming volume , delicate in sentiment , and graceful in expression .

		Fifty other examples might be quoted that are quite as good as the two we have chosen .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 The far West now claims our attention with two volames of verse , and we are recalled to more se - rious moods . ''

		In the Realms of Gold , '' by Mr.
Lorenzo Sosso	PERSON	, is a very serious book indeed , and its themes are of the highest -- God and the human soul .

		There is nothing very striking in the volume ; its contents are of a kind that a hundred minor poets are putting forth every year .

		A favorable example is this pleasing but not distinguished trib - ute to '' The Morning Star . ''

		* ' I thrill with joy to view afar The pale resplendent morning star : Radiant within the pearl-gray skies Before the burning snn arise , As each wan flower is glistening , As early bird s begin to sing .

		It seems some vestal pure and fair
Within Qod	ORGANIZATION	's vast cathedral there . ''

		It is the star in all the host Of stars that I still love the most ; The star of hope , the star of love .

		Who in those regions pure above , Seems in its passionless repose Like to a white and virgin rose Placed by a seraph on that shrine Whose holy incense blends with mine . ''

		Our other
Californian	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
Lionel Josaphare	PERSON	, and his book has the strange name , `` Turquoise and Iron . ''

		The explanation quickly follows , and this is its fashion : '' The innocently azure skies allure .

		Like turquoise hopes above an iron world .

		In happy passion or in mood obscure .

		The innocently azure skies allure .

		But , oh !

		when toiling toward a vision pure , The beaten body to the earth is hurled , The innocently azure skies allure .

		Like turquoise hopes above an iron world . ''

		The principal poem in this volume is called '' The Winged Heart . ''

		In the second stanza , this heart is addressed as a `` bleeding ace . ''

		A later stanza is the following : `` Still the living , living soul
Pines	LOCATION	within its human hole .

		And , without the boldened knife .

		Sits that hideous , tortured thing , that tortured cripple , hu - man life .

		'T is a serpent 's fangy jole .

		And the foldings of its tail still in the cursed future roll .

		And here seek I to explain Why my haunted crisscross brain In this manor should be dwelling while my heart flies in the rain . ''

		This poet should give his '' crisscross brain '' a rest .

		His unregulated imaginings are much too ambitious .

		Why , we wonder , do these
California	LOCATION	poets put their portraits in their volumes .

		Some months ago , we found
Christopher Mar	PERSON	- lowe in a historical romance , and now he is pre - sented to us in a five-act tragedy , the work of
Miss Josephine Preston Peabody	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a daring thing to follow in the footsteps of Home , whose '' Mar - lowe '' is known to all lovers of English poetry , a daring thing to embody the soul of `` Our morning star , sole risen before the sun , '' in any form of imaginative composition .

		But Miss
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	has been venturesome before this , for in her '' Fortune and Men 's Eyes '' she set speech upon the lips of Shakespeare .

		In this tragedy of ''
Marlowe	PERSON	, '' we have the figure of the fiery-hearted poet , glowing with the passion for perfection which made him solitary even when surrounded by his boon companions .


Greene	PERSON	,
Peele	PERSON	,
Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, and
Nash	PERSON	all appear , and
Richard Bame	PERSON	, of evil memory .

		The play begins with the success of '' Faustus , '' and ends with
Marlowe	PERSON	's death in the tavern at
Deptford	LOCATION	.

		He engages in the brawl with
Francis Archer	PERSON	, but is made to die by his own hand , his indignant spirit gladly escaping from a world in which the fairest-seeming things are the most de - ceitful , in which hypocrisy and insincerity are the passports to success .

		The scene in the third act with
Her Ladyship	PERSON	, the woman of rank in whose love he had once believed , offers the fine passage which we here reproduce .

		`` O
Helena	LOCATION	, How cheaply at the last you sell your God !

		Thirty pieces of silver , I had sworn Would be too little .

		Ah , but not for you .

		Not even with a kiss , but with a lie .

		You shew me how you rate Him , -- all of you !

		I waited for the reason .

		There had been A chance to make you glorious with some truth , -- And me to blink at unaccustomed gold : A brave * I love you not , -- I wish you gone ! '

		-- Such valor of the devil as he respects !

		But this poor coinage of an outcast metal .

		Stamped with God 's image I Ha , deny Him , I ?

		What have I seen of Him that I should know Where He is or is not ?

		I have searched the mire .

		And found Him not , indeed ; and for such temples As Holy Writ would have it that He dwells in .

		Look you , how cold and empty !

		-- Cold , not pure .

		No flame of heaven or hell , -- no fire at all .

		Deny Him , I ?

		And thou , dost thou affirm ?

		-- Living denial !

		-- Gentle blasphemy !

		Will you begone ?

		Nay , hear my parting word .

		Unmask yon ,
Helen	PERSON	.

		-- Truly you must go The way of dreams .

		Will you believe you live ?

		No , no , I think not , no indeed , not you !

		The fire burns out and leaves the ashes there .

		The cock crows and the spirits must begone .

		1 took you for a Woman , thing of dust , -- I -- I who showed you first what you might be !

		But see now , you were hollow all the time , A piece of magic .

		Now the air blows in .

		And you are gone in ashes .

		Well , begone !

		Ashes to ashes , dust to dust !

		-- Nay , go . ''

		This heartless woman whose falsity makes of all life a hideous mockery to the poet is effectively con - trasted with the gentle Kentish maiden whose pure memory saves for him some remnant of his faith in mankind .

		She is an exquisite figure , limned with delicate art .

		We have read Miss
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	's play -- every word of it -- with genuine pleasure .

		The poetry and character of the historical
Marlowe	PERSON	have always seemed to us to provide a sort of touchstone of taste and judgment ; who loves the one and under - stands the other can not go very far astray either in poetical appreciation or in human sympathy . ''

		The Heart of the Road , and Other Poems , '' by Miss
Anna Hempstead Branch	PERSON	, is a volume of serious lyrics , touched by mysticism , and expressive of an abstract mode of thought .

		They seem to derive in some measure from
Rossetti	PERSON	, although the 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, inspiration is not always as evident as in '' The Watch-Tower of the Soul , '' for example . ''

		I will be silent in my soal Since God has girt me round With His own silences in which There is no space for sound .

		Only His voice perchance may drop Like dew upon the ground . ''

		I will be silent and will lean Myself into all space .

		Love , didst thou think in all this life That thou couldst touch my face ?

		Nay , for God bade that I should turn Unto Himself for grace . ''

		This archaic mannerism and afEectation of naivete has to be very well done indeed to be convincing .

		Miss Branch 's verses become a little monotonous , but they have a good deal of the poetic spirit and much subtlety of rhythmical effect .

		Miss
Dickinson	PERSON	's new volume opens with '' The Cathedral , '' a poem in sections , providing a sort of poetic inventory of a cathedral , from the chimes to the cloister close . ''

		The High Altar , '' for example , is thus celebrated : '' A throne with King invisible , that stands For deathless dynasties not made with hands , Founded on certainty of things unseen , Whose law is perfect and whose fear is clean .

		Whose sovereign majesty doth condescend Unto the lowliest of them wljo bend Far down beneath upon the humblest stair , Submissive subjects of the altar 's care . ''

		Miss
Dickinson	PERSON	's poems are nearly all inspired by a rather vague religious sentiment , and their expres - sion is too strained to be effective .

		Her interpreta - tion of natural beauty seems to us finer than her religious philosophizing .

		The really beautiful '' Vale ! ''

		may be given as an illustration of her work at its best . ''

		Now let the frosty sentence pass !

		For I have garnered astors in my soul .

		To blur with sentiment the stolid year , Beyond the largess of their purple dole .

		And I have wrung the life-blood from the hours , Forgot old pain amid the russet wold .

		Steeped love in azure and immensity .

		And burned regret in scarlet and in gold .

		Ventured the circle of the hazel witch .

		And claimed of gusty winds rough brotherhood -- And buried in my heart a rain-wet path That led to sunset lurid through a wood .

		Amid gray embers one hot hope is let -- A torch unto a royal memory .

		And through the benison of dying leaves Blows my consent unto the chill decree .

		Now is all prophecy fulfilled !

		Thy rustling footfall .

		Autumn , bear thee soon Within the dim , unmeasured hills of Time Led by the waning of the hunter 's moon I '' The '' Sonnets and Songs '' of Mrs.
Charles Ken	PERSON	- dall
Adams	PERSON	make up a volume of verse that marks a distinct advance upon the author 's earlier '' Choir Invisible . ''

		The new poems are richer in content and more flexible in style than the old ones were .

		Since the sonnet is the form chiefly favored by Mrs.
Adams	PERSON	, we select a sonnet for our illustration , one equally fine in thought and in expression .

		It is called ''
Cuba	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Is thine the land that bore the honored name Of
Washington	LOCATION	?

		-- the land where Lincoln died ?

		Counting the cause of freedom sanctified So long as earth shall glorify their fame ?

		Look to it that thou smother not the flame They kindled , lest it be in time denied .

		And all their lofty leading thus defied .

		The womb that bore them know a bastard 's shame ! ''

		I stand with outstretched arms and bleeding heart .

		As in the name of ' Liberty ' I plead ; Arise !

		and fear alone the envenomed dart That searcheth , worse than death , ignoble deed ; Yea , read on tombs of those who died for Right , No bloodless sword did yet a tyrant smite . ''

		Something like half a hundred of these sonnets make up a sort of cycle upon Shakespearian themes and characters , and are characterized by insight and sympathetic feeling alike .

		Miss
Dorothy King	PERSON	's '' Verses '' are very simple things indeed , and make up a modest sheaf of about twoscore pages .

		`` First Notes of Spring '' is a pretty bit of song . ''

		Little brown buds on the lilac-bushes .

		Curling leaves where the tulips wake .

		Glimpses of green from sleeping jonquils .

		Chirpings sweet which the sparrows make . ''

		Tinkling sounds where the brooks are playing .

		Brilliant moss where the gray stones lie .

		Golden gleams from a happy crocus Greeting the
Spring	DATE	with ecstacy . ''

		Soothing breath of the warm winds blowing , Twitt ` ring music the robins sing .

		Then , with its thrill of perfect beauty .

		Comes the flash of a blue-bird 's wing . ''

		Last on our present list comes '' The Destiny , and Other Poems , '' by
Miss Florence Brooks	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title-poem is a set of lyrics loosely strung together , in which we have vainly sought for a unifying principle .

		The best of the lyrics is this : '' The body is not , love , save for the soul ; Dumb is the flesh and dead .

		Thy essence is elusive as the scroll Woven and formed and fled When the blue waves of forest smoke unroll Their tendrils overhead . ''

		I have grown sacred , love , because of you , Because of these blest hours ; And wine is as my mouth , and honey-dew My tears , and many flowers My flesh , and all my veins the heaven 's blue , -- The chrism of love is ours . ''

		Aside from the difficulty of picturing a wave with tendrils , these stanzas are not bad .

		An '' Ode to the Mountains '' is one of the more ambitious pieces in this collection , and we quote the opening stanzas : '' The dreaming mountains lie athwart the plain In plentitude of pride and distant calm ; Their grandeur is a psalm Of vaster harmonies than human tongue Creates to voice its pain -- A lovely anthem from their inmost caverns sprung . ''

		Yet far within that lofty wooded height Are sweet and sacred haunts my soul may see .

		Unknown , forever free From profanation of the blinded crowd That struggles in the night Below the towering summit 's earthward drooping cloud . ''

		Atravellerin ^ mf '' ^ ^ 0 ; ^ ' ^ ^ ^ ^ J V ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ agO , WaS Western wilds able , in addition to other journeyings , thirty years ago .

		^ ^ traverse the
United States	LOCATION	from north to south along the line of La Salle 's travels in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, and again from east to west along the line of De
Soto	PERSON	's and
Cabeza de Vaca	ORGANIZATION	's wanderings in the previous century , naust have a story to tell .

		Such a story Mr.
Paul Fountain	PERSON	has attempted in '' The Great Deserts and Forests of
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		As a tale of adventure , the work might have been greatly im - proved by giving it somewhat more of human in - terest and paying more regard to personal episodes which must have been of a thrilling nature .

		As a book of travel , it could have been made more in - forming if the writer had taken the trouble to identify his routes upon some map of modern date , and thus have adopted a more acurate geographical nomenclature ; and also if his recorded impressions of men -- white , black , and red -- had been more generally correct .

		But the book is evidently not intended to serve either as a tale of adventure or a book of travel .

		The writer 's chief incentive in making these extensive journeys far away from the haunts of men was an intense love for natural his - tory .

		While not technically a naturalist , -- a fact which he frequently deplores , -- he yet made copious notes of his close observations of natural phenomena ; and these would be of great value at the present time , when such a widespread popular interest is taken in the various branches of natural history , were it not that they must be used with great caution .

		For there are abundant opportunities for errors to creep into a transcription of notes made more than a quarter of a century since , however accurate those notes may have been in the first in - stance .

		The author has had frequent occasion to correct himself by means of footnotes and append - ices , and the reader will discover many instances where errors have escaped his attention .

		The value of the notes , even when correct , might have been enhanced had the book been furnished with an in - dex .

		Mr.
Fountain	PERSON	is an Englishman , and has written for English readers ; and his book is , un - fortunately , likely to perpetuate erroneous ideas regarding
America	LOCATION	and the Americans already too widely held among English stay-at-homes .

		Dr.
William Mason	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, Sr/mai ^ n. ^ ^ ^ the distinction of being the dean of the musical profession in
America	LOCATION	.

		For over fifty years he has been closely associated with musical affairs in this country and abroad ; and in his '' Memories of a Musical Life '' -LRB- Cen - tury Co. -RRB- he writes frankly , yet from a professional standpoint , of the development of music during
the second half of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		Dr.
Mason	PERSON	was born in
Boston	LOCATION	on
January 24 , 1829	DATE	, the son of
Lowell Mason	ORGANIZATION	-- widely known as the composer of hymn tunes and sacred melodies , and the man through whose efforts music was introduced into the public schools of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		He displayed his fondness for music at an early age , and was sent abroad to obtain a musical education , intending to study under Moscheles ,
Hauptmann	PERSON	, and
Richter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Through the misunderstanding of a letter , he did not begin his instruction with
Liszt	PERSON	until four years later ; he gives a very careful account of his first lesson with the great composer , and explains the characteristics of
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	's method .

		In his chapter on '' Music in
America	LOCATION	To-day , '' he says : '' Enormous progress in the art and science of music has been made in
America	LOCATION	since I began my studies in
Germany	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	... The time has gone by when it was necessary for students of the piano to go abroad to complete a musical education .

		There are now teachers of the piano of the first rank in all our principal cities , who secure better results with American pupils than foreign teachers do , be - cause they have a better understanding of our national character and temperament . ''

		Though the few original musical exercises included in the book appear at a casual glance to be simple , they are the result of long and laborious study .

		In fact , through - out the work the strong musical bent of the author 's mind is very marked .

		It is not alone the nice points , the apices juris of interpretation and con - struction , that he cares about or closely examines ; it is rather the broad general principles which lie , or ought to lie , at the basis of all interpretation .

		Dr.
Mason	PERSON	has numbered among his friends a long line of celebrities , and he writes about many of the great musicians in a reminiscent manner , though there is a plentiful intersprinkling of criticism which serves to illuminate the record and give it propor - tion .

		The illustrations , which are '' tipped in '' on different paper from the text and printed frequently in the faded color of the original manuscript , are remarkably interesting ; they include many repro - ductions of autographs from the author 's musical album , including manuscript music written by
Wagner	PERSON	,
Joachim	PERSON	,
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	,
Rubinstein	PERSON	,
Greig	PERSON	,
Schumann	LOCATION	, and others .

		On the whole , the make-up of the book is in harmony with its interesting con - tents .

		Popular essays ^ ^ of .


Brander Matthews	PERSON	has chosen ori the English an apt title for his recent volume of language .

		essays upon the English language -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		`` Parts of Speech '' -- the phrase is suggestive of endless exercises in parsing and '' dia - gramming , '' of all the dull abstractions of the old - time grammar lesson .

		With this connotation in mind the reader is prepared fully to appreciate the leaven in the new idea of the parts of speech : the conception which interprets the phrase literally , and which Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	is doing much to popu - larize .

		As he himself states it in his prefatory note , bis purpose in almost all these essays is to show '' that the English language belongs to the peoples who speak it -- that it is their own precious possession , to deal with at their pleasure and at , 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, their peril . ''

		This thesis -- that '' a language grows and is not made , '' that the many speakers , and not the few writers , of English , are the coart of last resort , not to be moved by the over-academic scruples of `` pedagogues and pedants , '' -- he dis - cusses in many of its implications .

		He shows how slang phrases and new words lose their plebeian associations when one realizes that the language is a living organism whose rehabilitation by means of these very despised neologisms is necessary to its literary power and vigor .

		Then , if the language is a race product , the character of '' the stock that speaks it '' becomes a vital matter , and its future in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	a legitimate and interesting field for speculation .

		The consideration of the linguistic ideals of the English race , whose basal motive seems to have been a desire for ef - fective simplicity , leads to discussions , first of the logical method of naturalizing foreign words , and then of the consideration due to the spelling reform movement .

		The ground covered in these essays , however familiar to the linguistic expert , will be new and inviting to many readers .

		Particularly will teachers of secondary English who have made no systematic study of historical English grammar find this popular exposition of the principles under - lying the science of language of the greatest interest and value .

		The life and work of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		In ''
Richard Wagner	PERSON	: His Life and His Dramas '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	has sought '' to supply
Wagner	PERSON	lovers with a single work which shall meet all their needs . ''

		A glance at the literature of the subject already accessible in English will serve to place Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book among its possible competitors .

		First of all , we had the translation of
Nohl	ORGANIZATION	's compact biography .

		Then came Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's elaborate two-volume work .

		More recently , we have had the rather slight performance of Mr.
Lidgey	PERSON	, and an English translation of
M. Lavig	PERSON	- nac 's exhaustive treatise .

		Of other books about
Wagner	PERSON	, dealing with parts of his work or aspects of his genius , there have been many , but those above mentioned are , as far as we can remember , the only ones that in any way dispute the field with Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	.

		The two brief accounts may be dismissed because they are brief ; Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's work is mainly biographical and critical , not supplying such analyses as are given by Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	;
M. Lavignac	PERSON	's work alone has a purpose and a plan closely similar to those of the work now under con - sideration .

		We should find it difficult to advise the lover of
Wagner	PERSON	, restricted to a single book , be - tween these two ; we should rather cut the Gordian knot by telling him to procure them both .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's work is a treatise of five hundred pages , painstaking and scholarly in execution , and more temperate in its judgments than are the books of most Wagnerian enthusiasts .

		Bather less than half of the contents are given up to biography and artistic characterization .

		The other and larger half provides an analytical account of the series of the music-dramas , from '' Rienzi '' to '' Parsifal , '' with the sources of their plots , the architectonics of their dramatic structure , and the significance of their musical themes .

		The illustrations of the volume are a portrait of the composer and a large number of illustrative passages in musical notation .

		The ` work is highly satisfactory in all respects , and , while we can not say that it supersedes its predeces - sors , it certainly supplements them in a way that fully justifies its existence .

		An elementary work on the Surely no one can feel , in presenting a fresh popular work bearing upon French Revolution , ^ .

		There must needs be much fresh material , or much novelty in treatment , to warrant such a production at this time ; and yet we find neither the one nor the other in the elementary sketch entitled '' The Last Days of the French Monarchy '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- , by Miss
Sophia H.Mac	PERSON	-
Lehose	PERSON	.

		To quote from the preface , the work is intended '' to enable the reader to approach the more important histories with interest and intelli - gence . ''

		The book 's sole title to distinction , in competition with the many similar works upon the market , is its wealth of illustration .

		The repro - ductions of old cuts and paintings are both inter - esting and well done , and together with excellent typography and presswork serve to make a very pretty book .

		Probably the author would assert also that a service had been rendered in the multi - tude of footnotes cited as references to the body of the text .

		In reality , profuse use of footnotes is necessary and excusable only in a technical mono - graphic work on a new or controverted topic , as in a voluminous exhaustive production ; in either of which cases , the citations serve as the proof of statements made or arguments advanced .

		The lack of any distinctive feature in style , treatment , or contents precludes any critical review .

		In short , the book presents the facts ordinarily stated , in the manner customary with a score of other works of like scope .

		It closes with
1788	DATE	and is preliminary to the Revolution itself , which is to be considered in a succeeding volume .

		, _ ... Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	, the author of An English ' j p poeVs view of a subtle essay on poetry , and ot a Walt Whitman .

		yolume of poems as well , has written an elaborate essay on ''
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's Poetry '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , and accompanied it with about fifty pages of selections from the `` Leaves of Grass . ''

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	is of those who admire Whitman judi - ciously , with discrimination between the finer and the baser aspects of his expression , finding much dross in the melting-pot into which the poet cast the product of his imagination , but finding also the pure metal underneath .

		The substance of the wri - ter 's criticism is found in the following passage : `` Sometimes we find ourselves in the middle of plain , inofEensive prose without quite knowing how we got there .

		1902 J THE BlAL 55 Sometimes there is a sudden descent from lofty heights to ignominious depths .

		Sometimes a momentary plunge into the commonplace or the grotesque mars the movement of an otherwise beautiful passage .

		But through all its ups and downs the form of Whitman 's poetry suits itself admirably to the matter , or rather to the spirit .

		The want of harmony and rhythm is quite as much inward as outward .

		A chaotic philosophy -- a philosophy which does its best to give back to the ' void and formless Infinite all that
Time	ORGANIZATION	has won from it ' -- is fitly mirrored in a formless outward form . ''

		Throughout the essay .

		Whitman 's artistic dualism is brought into prominence -- `` consciously and theoretically , he is the poet of democratic equality , -- and therefore of chaos ; unconsciously , and in spite of himself , he is the poet of the ideal . ''

		The writer believes that '' the poet , pure and simple , will be remembered and honoured when the socio - political prophet has been forgotten , or , if remem - bered , has fallen into disesteem . ''

		In making his selections , which occupy less space than the essay itself , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	has sought to give us only the best of Whitman .

		More than half of his pages are occupied with the three great pieces : '' When lilacs last , '' '' Out of the cradle endlessly rocking , '' and the '' Passage to
India	LOCATION	. ''


Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's Nothing but praise awaits the `` New '' New Canterbury Canterbury Tales '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Tales . ''

		jyjj .


Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	.

		Alone among the writers of the day , perhaps , is he competent to add to the work of Chaucer without doing violence to the literary convention of that early time .

		In plan and treatment he has followed his original closely , assembling his party together under the leadership of the
Prioress of Ambresbury	ORGANIZATION	in the royal city of Winchester on Mayday in the year of grace
1450	DATE	, on their way to do pious duty at the shrine of St.
Thomas i	PERSON	,
Becket	LOCATION	at
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were only five days on their journey , in which time six tales are told by the miscellaneous company under the headship of the noble
Prioress	ORGANIZATION	, after a delightful prologue has introduced a little romance of its own by way of providing the necessary links between the several stories .

		The Scrivener of the party tells of '' The
Countess Alys	PERSON	, '' that good wo - man for whom the Order of the Garter was founded ; Captain
Salomon Brazenhead	PERSON	, veteran of Italian wars , discloses the tragic history of '' The Half-Brothers , '' drawn from the annals of
Venice	LOCATION	and
Milan	LOCATION	; the Prioress herself takes the pathetic legend of '' St.
Gervase	PERSON	of Plessy '' from some '' Lives of the Saints '' unknown to others ; Master
Richard Smith	PERSON	, a shipman of Hull , discourses upon '' The Cast of the
Apple	ORGANIZATION	, '' an episode on the Welsh border ; and young
Percival Perceforest	PERSON	recounts a merry little comedy of errors , styled ''
Eugenio	PERSON	and Galeotto , '' with its scene alternating between
Venice	LOCATION	and
Mantua	LOCATION	.

		All these are in prose , like Chaucer 's ''
Parson	PERSON	's Tale '' and '' The Tale of Meliboeus '' ; and all most successfully avoid the introduction of modern thought and feeling , though not modern phrasing .

		Nothing in recent years gives more promise of literary permanence than Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's latest book .

		Leaders of ^ ^ * '' ^ '' ® ' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the times is Mr.
James	PERSON	finance and
Bimley	ORGANIZATION	's `` Millionaires and Kings industry .

		^ f Enterprise '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , with its fifty or more brisk sketches of leading Amer - ican financiers md captains of commerce .

		The English authorsiip of the book lends it an added interest to us , aid it must be admitted that full justice has been done to the American spirit of alertness , energy , and progress .

		Compiled under the auspices of tie Messrs.
Harmsworth	PERSON	, the volume bears witness to its journalistic origin in the pith and point that diaracterize its chapters .

		All that the curious neei to know about Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	and Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	and Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, and half a hundred ^ other '' dngs of enterprise '' now prominent in the public eje , is agreeably set forth in pages fairly bristling with figures , usually running up into the milliors , preceded by the pound-sterling sign .

		In tastefilness of binding , in wealth of full - page portraiture and other illustration , and in ex - cellence of papr and print , this cyclopaedia of contemporary putocracy almost rises to the dignity of literature .

		5ven the most unworldly will be tempted to lingtr over its wonderful tales of mate - rial achievemens .

		Essays by the late Dr.
Everett	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` he late Dean of the
Harvard Di	ORGANIZATION	- • inity School , Dr.
C. C. Everett	PERSON	, has leen such a power in the world of thought during the present generation , that a posthumous colection of his writings is sure of a cordial receptioi .

		The twelve '' Essays Theological and Literary '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- exhibit a well-defined unity , the theological ones being philosophical rather than dogmatic , .

		nd the literary ones being devoted to revealing the same spiritual ideas imbedded in the poetry of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Fnm the author 's point of view , phil - osophy and poery are very much akin .

		He finds in
Tennyson	LOCATION	an -LRB-
Browning	PERSON	two of the great spiritual forces of our ceitury , presenting together the higher life in its f ulnes , doing together what no one singer could have accanplished .

		Emerson is the repre - sentative optiaist of the age , behind whom the preacher has sh-ewdly entrenched himself ; while no literary wok strikes its roots so deep into our modern though and life as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Faust . ''

		The keen critical aialysis with which these points are developed attes their philosophical as well as literary value .

		Jnder the title of '' Animals '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	has Drepared a popular natural history of mammals , -- especially such mammals as have not been domesicated by man .

		The contrast to the the '' Diary of -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , is a young Scottish o # Bcer who was fiUiig a post in the bert

		Then is little or no attempt at continuous description ; ani we are won by the simplicity and obvious truth of t e young fellow who took his war so gayly , or his gol so seriously , as to be laying out a putting ground in th intervals of the assaults .

		The Diary is furnished with desirable maps , and is preceded by an appreciative puface from Mr ,

Henry Wotton	PERSON	ar < of no slight in - terest .

		The volume , in type and fom , is a facsimile reproduction of the original , which i very rare ; and our only criticism is that the types , lossibly not too clear in the original , suffer in the reprciuction .


Wotton	PERSON	was a man of attainment , and his prsonality speaks through his writings .

		The style is qui nt and amiable , and the matter equally quaint and ttractive to the lover and collector of rare specimens .

		Students of international problems will find interest in the account here given of political conditions under the control of

		The great preponderance of works of fiction among the books drawn from public libraries has always been a subject of much concern to librarians and other men engaged in the busi - ness of public education .

		It comes up for discussion perennially , and various are the sug - gestions made for the correction of what is generally recognized as an evil .

		While there is nothing to say against the practice of reading fiction , abstractly considered , there is much to say against the novel-reading habit which seems to be fastened upon the majority of those who use our public libraries .

		When the statistics of circulation show that works of fiction constitute from fifty to eighty per cent of the books that are taken for home reading , there is certainly some reason to think that the library is regarded as a source of entertainment rather than of public education , and some reason to question the wisdom of taxing the people at large for such a purpose .

		Even if careful consideration of the whole subject convinces us that a library , put chiefly to such uses , is better than no library at all , and still on the whole a worthy object of public support , it is certainly obligatory upon those who control the supply of free books to use all possible vigilance in minimizing the evil of thoughtless reading , and in encour - aging the literary and studious tastes of readers .

		Very often the statistics themselves disguise the evil which they can not wholly conceal .

		A library which reports sixty per cent of fiction among the books circulated will very likely report also from ten to fifteen per cent of juve - nile literature -LRB- most of which is fiction -RRB- , and from five to ten per cent of books in foreign languages , of which novels form the larger fraction .

		Some librarians regard this condition of affairs with complacency , and , while seizing every opportunity that is offered to encourage the reading of serious books , still hold to the view which was advocated by the late
W. F. Poole	PERSON	-- the view that most of these novel - readers would read nothing at all unless they could get what they wanted , and that it is well for them to acquire the reading habit even if a wiser judgment disapproves of their habitual selection of books .

		There is much to be said for this view , and for its corollary that the 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, exercise of the reading habit in any form tends to bring about a gradual elevation of literary taste , especially if the reader be supplied all along with gentle and unobtrusive incitements to the acquisition of better standards and broader interests .

		This sort of stimulus has to be applied tactfully , and it is a distinctive characteristic of the good librarian that he knows how to apply it with judgment and with - out ruffling the reader 's temper .

		The natural man , who has outgrown the years of tutelage , resents being practised upon by others for his own good , and , although he may be led to the water , he must be left to believe that he is drinking it of his own volition .

		The subject of fiction in the public library has recently come up for renewed discussion in connection with a report from
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, according to which the librarian , during the past four years , has reduced the circulation of fiction by about one-fourth .

		This may not seem strange news to the general reader , but to those who know anything of library work from its professional side , the report is so startling that it seems almost sen - sational .

		One librarian says it is what Lord Dundreary would have called a '' staggerer . ''

		Experience shows the percentage of fiction to be so nearly uniform from year to year that a change of as little as five per cent would excite comment .

		Naturally , then , a change -LRB- and for the better -RRB- of something like five times that percentage is a cause for both surprise and curious interest .

		By just what means so great a reduction of novel-reading has been brought about we do not know , but so gratifying a result is sure to excite the spirits of both inquiry and emulation in the breasts of librarians all over the country .

		There are many devices of the obvious sort for the lowering of the percentage of fiction and the raising of the percentage of serious , reading , and these have been used by all good librarians in the
United States	LOCATION	during the quarter-century that librarianship has been rec - ognized as one of the professions .

		They in - clude such things as the limited supplying of novels and the liberal supplying of better books , the publication of annotated and descriptive lists upon special subjects , the coiSperation of librarians with teachers in the work of the schools , the opening of the library shelves to easy access on the part of the public , and the judicious use of personal counsel on the subject of reading .

		But there seems to be a rather narrow limit to the efficacy of any of these de - vices , or of all of them together ; if they have proved adequate to effect the reduction reported from
Springfield	LOCATION	, the case is as surprising as it is exceptional , and few librarians will be hopeful of accomplishing similar results by such means .

		What we wish now to consider are certain methods of a farther-reaching and more radical sort that have either been put inta operation of late years here and there , or that have been suggested by the recent revival of interest in the discussion .

		The ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' not long ^ ago invited professional opinions upon this sub - ject , and elicited several suggestions that are deserving of serious consideration .

		Mr.
Herbert Putnam	PERSON	, who by virtue of his official position is the leader of the profession of librarianship in
America	LOCATION	, makes a sugges - tion that may be pronounced radical , but that commends itself to the sober intelligence after the first shock of surprise is over .

		It is , simply , that no works of fiction be purchased by public libraries for at least a year after publication .

		Nothing could be more sensible than the following words : '' There is , however , a demand for fiction which I do not believe can legitimately be met by the public library .

		That is the demand for the latest new novel merely because it is the latest new novel .

		We all read current novels also and enjoy and profit by them .

		But the demand for them is largely artificial , for a pur - pose merely social , and it is apt to be transitory .

		No free library can meet it adequately , and the attempt to meet it is an expense and annoyance to the reader and expense and burden to itself . ''

		The exclusion of the newest fiction from the library shelves would doubtless occasion a great outcry , but the loss to the public would be more imaginary than real .

		Every librarian knows how hollow is the pretence of meeting the popular demand for the novels of the day .

		To supply that demand would entail an ex - penditure that no librarian could sanction .

		Take such a novel , for example , as '' The Crisis , '' and such a library , for example , as that of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Probably five hundred people were daily clamoring for that particular novel during the weeks that immediately followed its publication .

		To satisfy them , it would have been necessary to purchase several thou - sands of copies , with the absolute certainty that next year they would be collecting dust upon the shelves , if not actually consigned to the lumber-room .

		The satisfaction of an ephem - eral fancy of this sort is an absolutely illegiti - mate demand to make upon any public library .

		The only library that has a right to spend
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 76 money in this reckless fashion is the private enterprise of the
Mudie	PERSON	type , which exists for the special purpose of catering to the taste of the moment .

		What such a library as the
Chicago	LOCATION	institution actually does in the case of a novel like `` The Crisis '' is to purchase forty or fifty copies of the work , and supply one applicant out of every two or three hundred .

		`` In proposing to supply such a novel , '' says Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	, '' the library deludes the public and reduces its capacity for service really serviceable . ''

		It does not really supply the demand , and succeeds only in gratifying an occasional applicant at the cost of creating ex - asperation in the breasts of the thousands who , knowing that the book is in the library , ask for it from day to day until they desist from sheer weariness .

		We are inclined to think , on the whole , that every public library would be well-advised in adopting Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's suggestion , thus forc - ing its patrons to take , as far as the library is concerned ,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's well-known advice against reading books that have not kept alive for at least a year .

		Using '' The Crisis '' once more for our illustration , it is safe to say that by next
summer	DATE	the demand for that excellent story will have fallen to normal proportions .

		It will still be asked for by a few people , and it will be as proper to provide copies to be read as it is proper to provide copies of `` The Spy . ''

		This , of course , presents an extreme case , for , besides the two or three novels that a capricious public marks for its favor every season , there are two or three hundred others of merit sufficient to entitle their claims to be recognized .

		But the reasoning to be employed is similar in all the cases ; the demand for cur - rent fiction is essentially temporary and artifi - cial , and it is doubtful if it be the policy of wisdom to put into a public library any books for which there may not be some reasonable demand year after year .

		The librarian who is unwilling to make him - self disliked by refusing to supply the public with current novels may find a sort of way out of the difficulty by adopting a plan which has already been successfully operated in a few places .

		This is the plan of opening a special department of new fiction , buying enough books to meet the demand , and making a small charge for their use .

		The doctrinaire objection that all the services of a public library must be free may be met by stating the obvious fact that this particular service is impossible unless it be made self-supporting .

		The fee might be a very small one -- much less than that charged by the private libraries -- and yet sufficient to make the books thus circulated pay for them - selves .

		The average novel costs the library rather less than one dollar ; it may be in con - stant use for a year or more before it is worn out ; if it is made to bring in
two cents	MONEY	a week during that year , the transaction will be fair to all parties -- no appreciable burden , cer - tainly , upon the reader , and no burden upon the budget except on the score of library service .

		At the end of the book 's career , it will have provided entertainment for possibly fifty fam - ilies , at practically no cost to the library ; it will have paid for itself , and may be thrown away with a good conscience .

		If the public library is , in any real sense , to provide its patrons with the latest novels , we believe that this is the only legitimate way of doing it .

		But we are sufficiently tainted with the educational theory of the library to think Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's plan , after all , the one better deserving to be pursued .

		The two suggestions thus considered are the only ones that go to the root of the matter .

		Other suggestions are of the nature of ingenious devices or persuasive methods .

		One of the best of them is the two-card system which gives every card-holder the right to draw two books at the same time , only one of which may be a work of fiction .

		This encourages collateral reading of the serious kind , and is said to secure good results .

		Practical librarians are now gen - erally learning how much good may be done by such things as open shelves , special bib - liographies of timely interest , talks with teachers and school children , object-lessons in model collections of standard literature , the encour - agement of clubs and study-classes , and the judicious selection of the fiction that is provided for circulation .

		These means are all praise - worthy , and are , in their aggregate employment , productive of marked benefit .

		And , in all this discussion , it must not be forgotten that the reading of good fiction is something more than entertainment , that it is a study of one of the great forms of creative literature , and one of the most potent agencies whereby the sym - pathies may be quickened , the horizon enlarged , the higher interests aroused , and culture at - tained .

		We have forever passed the day when thoughtful people could condemn the reading of fiction as such ; we have come to understand for good that the best novels are among the best books there are , however we may deprecate the reading of the shallow and sensational sorts of fiction .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY : ITS PURPOSES AND POSSIBILITIES .

		Those who are working for popular education and the betterment of social condkions are again indebted to the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, who includes in his last annual report a chapter devoted to the statistics of public libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The rapid and greatly accelerating growth which is shown to have taken place since the report of five years ago , in the number _ of libraries reporting , the number of volumes which have been added , and the work the libraries are accomplish - ing , comes as a surprise even to those who have been most interested in watching the development of the library movement .

		In view of this evidence of material prosperity , and the prominence which has in the past few years been given to the public library , it may not be unprofitable for us to consider what the public library of the present day stands for ; what is its aim and purpose ; what the place it holds in the < ; ivic life of this day , that cities should so readily assume its support ; what the meaning of the oppor - tunity it holds which makes it appeal so forcefully to the philanthro -RSB- -RRB- i8t , not only as a means of enriching the daily life of the people , but of giving to the stu - ■ dent the means of making individual research , by furnishing the rare and costly collections which are necessary for such work ; in short , to consider to what the public library has already attained , and to discover , if we can , to what larger things the spirit which has been moving so mightily in these latter days may be leading us .

		The function of the public library is to supply books , for purposes of both entertainment and information , to its readers .

		It aims to supply the best books to the largest number .

		It seeks not only to supply the needs of the individual reader , but to supplement all other educational forces of the city and to aid any eJSort which is made for its good .

		In its educational work , the city library of to-day parallels the schools , from the kindergarten to the university , and goes beyond the latter in its - services to the advanced student and investigator .

		The children 's rooms in our libraries know no age limit , and welcome the youngest children that are able to use books , or even to enjoy pic - tures ; showing them that a book may be to them a source of delight , rather than a task , and solicit - ing their interest in its proper care and handling .

		Each important subject , as history , • biography , travel , science , poetry , and even political science , ethics , and religion , is represented by books suitable for younger readers ; and this collection is cata - logued , classified , numbered , and arranged in a manner similar to that of the main collection .

		If in addition to this , as is often the case , the holders of juvenile membership cards are allowed to use the main collection , when the time arrives that -LRB- their membership is transferred to the general cir - culating department , they are not coming upon unknown ground , but are entering a territory with which they may have already made themselves acquainted , and in which they will find familiar landmarks and guides .

		The curricula of the public schools are carefully studied , and books which will aid the pupil in enlarging the subject , broadening his horizon , and deepening his interest , are plenti - fully supplied , -- the books recommended for col - lateral reading being , of course , included in the number .

		The education of the individual in the schools and beyond , is comprised in three periods , as fol - lows : First : That of acquisition alone , in which the text books are descriptive , little more than statements of fact , and the work mainly that of memory .

		Second : That of comparison , in which truths and facts are placed in relation to each other and inter - preted ; the work of the reason and of judgment .

		The two are not separated by a definite line , the work of acquiring knowledge going on still in the second stage .

		Third : That of investigation and original re - search , whether under the auspices of an institution , or independently .

		In this the student uses the knowledge already acquired as stepping-stones to discovery in realms still unknown .

		In the first stage the library is of value by broadening and presenting in a more attractive way the facts of the text books .

		As the pupil passes gradually into the second stage , of compari - son and interpretation , the value of the library becomes greater , and its use essential to any full understanding of the relations of the subjects under consideration .

		For work in the third stage the library , the storehouse of all human knowledge , is indispensable .

		He who would reach out and pluck treasures from the unknown in any field , must first master and plant himself firmly upon that which is known .

		Dr. Oilman , in describing the function of a university in conserving knowledge and promot - ing investigation , has happily said that '' Libraries and museums are the dwelling places of univer - sities . ''

		While the library is thus the handmaid and helper of the school throughout the entire course , and is the workshop of the advanced student , the investigator and explorer , it has a function of even greater importance for those whose opportunities for education do not go beyond the public schools , and a function which no other institution can so well perform ; that is , to continue the education for good citizenship that is begun in the public schools .

		To the large number , -- to the great majority of our boys and girls , -- who leave school at the age of fourteen or fifteen , when they are just ready to enter the high school , whose work in school has been largely that of learning the art of reading and of storing their memories with elementary knowl - edge , whose work has been almost entirely in the first stage of education , -- to these the public
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL TT library must be high school , college , university ; it must give to them the only opportunity they are likely to have of broadening and increasing their knowledge , of properly relating and interpreting the facts of nature and of life , and making their knowledge a consistent whole instead of a mere collection of isolated facts .

		This is an additional and still more weighty reason for training children in the use of the library from their earliest school - days ; as , in addition to its immediate advantage in their school work , it will make them acquainted with that institution which must be their main reli - ance in continuing their education beyond the period of their school life ; and having once tested its usefulness in answering the questions of the schoolroom , they will more readily turn to it for assistance when confronted by the larger problems of life .

		The library is in touch with every phase and interest of human life , and may be helpful in all .

		To the man or woman who is merely breadwinner or homemaker , it offers practical suggestion and helpful information from its store of books on the various arts and handicrafts .

		In addition to the many books on practical matters which are of gen - eral interest and in demand always and every - where , every library should consider the business interests peculiar to its location , -- as shipbuilding , manufactures , mining , agriculture , -- and should provide itself with the best literature upon these subjects , to the great practical benefit of those engaged in these occupations .

		It is a fact that certain towns in this country which have good technical libraries have attained preeminence in certain manufacturing industries , largely due , I believe , to the fact that the library had quietly , year after year , supplied to the workman the best books upon his special work , and thus enabled him to come to his daily task with more exact informa - tion and with greater intelligence ; and in this way the libraries have yielded to their cities direct finan - cial returns for the outlay .

		It is a fact also , to which the records of public libraries generally will bear witness , that books on house-building , home - making , the care of children and of the sick , the household arts and elegancies , are in large and con - stant demand ; and while it is not possible to measure the results of their use , it is fair to assume that they are doing a great deal toward the making of more comfortable and happy homes .

		The ten - dency of the reading habit is toward economy and thrift .

		A taste for books restrains from unprofit - able , expensive , and harmful amusements , and arouses interest in the things that are better worth while .

		The reading of books for entertainment merely , within reasonable bounds , is a pleasure which is followed by no disagreeable recollections .

		The library is not only a direct aid in the arts of life to the individual , but is also helpful in public affairs .

		The pedagogical department of a city library is the library of city school teachers , and their use of it renders it exceedingly valuable to the work of the schools .

		That department which deals with public questions -- such as highways , sewers , lighting , car service , police , sanitary and fire pro- tection -- is a practical library of information for the municipal authorities upon subjects that are of the greatest importance to the welfare of the city ; and also gives to the private citizen an opportunity to form an opinion as to the conduct of city affairs .

		Indeed , there is no phase of the work of the library which is of such importance as that of affording to all of our citizens , and to the boys and girls who are preparing for citizenship , an opportunity to fit themselves for their civic duties .

		An American citizen is called upon to express , at the voting booth and elsewhere , an opinion not only upon municipal questions of vital importance , but , in the wider realm of state and national politics , he must decide upon questions of foreign policy , upon great eco - nomic problems upon which the prosperity of the country largely depends , which are complex and diflficult and should have careful study .

		The de - partments of sociology and history should be of great value to the thoughtful citizen .

		While the public library can not lend itself to the propaganda of any particular school of opinion , it is the arena into which all opinions worthy of consideration may enter with the assurance of fair presentation .

		The public library has already become an important factor in the political education of our citizens , and there are wonderful possibilities for greater devel - opment along this same line .

		Thus far I have only spoken of the economic and social value of the library , as an aid to the citizen and the city in material interest and in civic duties .

		But beyond this is its use in the enlarging , the up - lifting , the sweetening of the individual life .

		I need not argue this ; we all recognize the value of good books to the human soul , -- of the opportunity they give us of communion with the masters , of realizing the permanent , the eternal , the worthy .

		Words - worth has said : '' There is One great society on earth , The uoble living and the noble dead . ''

		It is not given to many of us to commune familiarly in the flesh with those who are recognized as standing preeminently above their fellows ; but we may from the shelves of our library choose at will our intimate companions from the greatest and noblest of all time , and we may in the solitude of our own rooms commune with them as with familiar friends .

		A great man once said : '' But when evening falls I go home and enter my study .

		On the threshold I lay aside my country gar - ments , soiled with mire , and array myself in courtly garb .

		Thus attired I make my entrance into the an - cient courts of the men of old , where they receive me with love , and where I feed upon the food which only is my own and for which I was born .

		For four hours ' space I feel no annoyance , forget all care ; poverty can not frighten , nor death appal me . ''

		This realm is the heritage of us all ; but for many 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, of us , for most of us , indeed , the only way of ap - proach lies through the open alcoves of the public library .

		So far as the public library lies parallel to the primary and secondary work in our schools , it re - ceives its support in the same way and for the same reason ; namely , that it is educating the younger generation for the duties of citizenship .

		The same claim may fairly be made for all library work , on the ground that whatever helps a man to do his work more ably and honestly , and to earn a better living for his family , -- whatever enables a woman to make a home in which grace and comfort and elegance shall be more abundant , -- and whatever instructs them both as to their social relations and civic duties , is beneficial to the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the same may be said with almost equal truth of the range of library work which is general and popular ; for whatever makes a man better informed , broader in his views , and contributes to his happiness and contentment , will tend to make him a better citizen .

		The city which spends thirty dollars a year on the elementary education of each of its school children can well afford to spend one dollar per year for each in support of a library to enable them to continue their education .

		It is only when we come to that higher range of library work which meets the needs of advanced students and original investigators , which involves the purchase of expensive collections to be used by comparatively few people , that a practical question arises as to how far the municipal tax-supported library should go .

		I said a practical question , for there can hardly be a doubt as to the right of pro- viding for higher education at public expense .

		We have in its favor the authoritative opinion of the fathers of the Republic , and of some of its greatest statesmen , from
Washington	LOCATION	to
Edward Everett	PERSON	.

		We have precedent in the great state universities , which , under the fostering care of the state and by its support , are doing a wonderful educational work .

		But with the municipality it is not a question of theoretical right , but of ways and means .

		Our city libraries are usually supported by taxation , and re - ceive only a small fraction of the amount levied for municipal purposes .

		In one city with whose work I am familiar , and which received rather a larger part of the levy than in most cities , this proportion of the municipal levy devoted to the library is about one and one-half per cent of the whole .

		This pro- portion seems small ; but in the great pressure for improvements which are essential to the growth of the city , and for protection , and with a burden of taxation already heavy , it is not easy to see how any considerable increase can fairly be made in the levy for library purposes .

		This is the condition in most of our rapidly growing cities .

		And in most of them the demand for books to be used in con - nection with the school work , or of immediate value along the other lines I have indicated , is much greater than can be met .

		In this condition it is difficult for the public library to devote any con - siderable part of its funds to the purchase of book & for the use of advanced students ; although it may recognize clearly the value of such work , and may see that it does ultimately yield benefits to the community .

		The need of adequate housing for libraries , of buildings which shall be convenient and dignified and beautiful , and which shall be built amply enough to supply the wants of future generations , is being met by state and municipal appropriations and by magnificent private gifts .

		During the year ending -
July 1 , 1901	DATE	, about
$ 19,000,000	MONEY	was given to the libraries of the
United States	LOCATION	, of which sum th & larger part was given expressly for the erection of buildings .

		With this want supplied comes the need of larger collections of books ; a need which , when it is fully understood , we may hope to see met by endowments for the definite purpose of supplying book funds .

		The building logically comes first j for , unless a library has a home which is commo - dious and convenient and reasonably secure from loss by fire , it can not hope for any considerable ad - dition to its collections by gifts .

		If it is fortunate enough to have a building which is not only ampla and safe , but beautiful and dignified , its attraction for the donor is still greater .

		After the building is supplied , the most urgent need is for more books , , for larger collections , both for the special student and for popular use .

		The noble gifts which have been made within the past few years give us reason to hope that when these needs of the library are under - stood , they will be met in the same generous way .

		A study of the reports of our city libraries from year to year shows that the collections are not being increased as largely as is necessary to do the work which should be done , owing to lack of funds ; and the testimony of librarians in public libraries gen - erally will be that the demands upon their libra - ries are much greater than they can meet .

		An ad - equate supply of books is of no less importance than a noble building .

		And this is a perennial need ; it can not be met sufficiently by a single gift , but rather by vested funds which shall provide for ad - ditions regularly from year to year .

		Side by side with the name of him who provided the building will be the name of him who endows the institution with ample book funds , and thus continuously and cumulatively increases its educational power , its influence for social betterment , for generation after generation of readers in all the years to come .

		THE DIAL 79
COMMUNICA TION	ORGANIZATION	.

		WHAT THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION COULD DO FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		There are three undertakings in the interest of schol - arly users of libraries , and in the interest of librarians themselves , which seem to come directly within the scope of the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of these is the establishment of a lending library for libraries , to consist of serial publications and other large and expensive works that an average library , and even a library of more than average size , could not obtain , but which might be needed in research work by some of its constituents .

		This would seem , in a way , to conflict with the expressed intention of the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	to do this very thing .

		But , for one thing , the claims on the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	in this respect would be very numerous , and would very often come from persons who would not use the books for purposes of pure research ; further , there would be a not inconsiderable number of publications that the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	could not , for one reason or another , procure , but which the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	might re - gard as its duty to supply .

		The greatest burden on the modern scientific inves - tigator is the necessity of working out the bibliography of the subject on which he is to engage .

		It consumes valuable time that he could use to better purpose , and the bibliography which he ultimately does procure is ■ usually of very inferior workmanship , for the reason that few scientific specialists are trained bibliographers .

		If the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	would establish a biblio - graphical department where the investigator could have his bibliographical material collected for him , it would be a great boon .

		Of course such a department would necessarily have among its officers and assistants men of scientific training , so that each topic could be • assigned to a man who in some measure would combine the attainments of the bibliographer and the scientific specialist .

		The department should also engage on its own account in the preparation of special bibliographies which might be found to be particularly needed .

		By a judicious use of electrotypes and printed cards , dupli - cation of work could be avoided , and every entry once made would serve all future purposes .

		It would be particularly useful to the library world if the Carnegie Institution would offer facilities for post-graduate study of bibliography and library admin - istration .

		There is at present no place in this country where the would-be librarian or bibliographer can fit himself , beyond an elementary stage , for his life work .

		The subjects of study which one wishing to prepare himself for bibliographical or library work would pursue are : 1 , The literature of bibliography and librarianship ; 2 , The use and handling of books as literary tools ; 3 , Bibliographical methodology -LRB- i. e. , methods of com - pilation and recording -RRB- ; 4 , Comparative history of lit - erature and science ; 5 , Classification of knowledge and of books ; 6 , History of libraries and library adminis - tration ; 7 , History of writing and printing , including the study of the methods of the mediaeval scribes and the early printers .

		* A few years ago the
Registrar of Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	, on being invited to deliver the Rede Lecture before that university , chose as his subject , '' Libraries in the Mediaeval and Renaissance Periods . ''

		The lecture was pub - lished and is doubtless familiar to many libra - rians .

		A much more elaborate and compre - hensive work on the same general theme is now issued by the same writer .

		Not since the appearance of
Gottlieb	PERSON	's '' Mittelalterliche Bibliotheken '' has there been offered to those interested in library history a book of equal importance in this special department .

		Indeed , in choosing his somewhat restricted province of research , the author has entered a field com - paratively free from competitors , and his work has the merit of novelty to add to its more substantial excellences .

		First to be treated is the library -LRB- or record - rooms -RRB- in the palace of Assur-bani-pal -LRB-
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- danapalus -RRB- at
Nineveh	LOCATION	, discovered by
Layard	ORGANIZATION	in
1850	DATE	.

		We are told that the books , or tab - lets , were devoted to history , law , science , magic , dogma , legend ; that there was a special officer to take care of them ; that they were arranged in series , with precautions for keeping the tablets of each series in their proper se - quence ; and that there was a general catalogue , and probably a class catalogue as well .

		This information is meagre , but interesting .

		Why , one is tempted to query , did not Mr.
Clark	PERSON	go back to the older Babylonian libraries for a beginning ?

		Of
Sargon	ORGANIZATION	's library , at
Agane	LOCATION	, we know at least something .

		Its catalogue has been unearthed and shows that each tablet was numbered , so as to be called for by number rather than by title .

		Egyptian libraries do not detain our author long , nor does he so much as mention the library of King Osymaudyas -LRB- Rameses I. -RRB- in the
Ramesseum	LOCATION	near
Thebes	LOCATION	, of which
Diodorus Siculus	PERSON	tells us that it bore the apt inscription , '' Dispensary of the Soul . ''

		Of the libraries at
Alexandria	LOCATION	-- for there were two -- next to nothing is known as to their housing and arrangement ; so the writer passes on to

Greece	LOCATION	and

		An Essay on the Development of Libraries and their Fittings , from the
Earliest Times	ORGANIZATION	to the End of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

John Willis Clark	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, F.S.A. Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, although the ancient authorities appear to have been most diligently ransacked .

		From the elder
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	, from
Strabo	PERSON	and
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	and
Vitruvius	PERSON	, the following is gleaned concerning the famous library at
Pergamon	LOCATION	: '' These magnificent structures , which won for Per - gamon the distinction of being ' by far the noblest city in
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, ' were in the main due to Eumenes the Second , who , during his reign of nearly forty years -LRB- B. C. 197-59 -RRB- was enabled , by the wise policy of supporting the Romans , to transform his petty state into a powerful monarchy .

		The construction of a library is especially referred to him by
Strabo	PERSON	, and from the statement of Vitruvius that it was built for the delight of the world at large -LRB- in communem delectationem -RRB- , we may infer that it was intended to be public .

		That he was an energetic book-collector , under whose direction a large staff of scribes was perpetually at work , may be gathered from the well-known story that his biblio - graphical rival at
Alexandria	LOCATION	, exasperated by his activity and success , conceived the ingenious device of crippling his endeavours by forbidding the exportation of papyrus .

		Eumenes , however , says the chronicler , was equal to the occasion , and defeated the scheme by inventing parchment .

		It is probable that Eumenes not only began but completed the library , for in less than a quarter of a century after his death -LRB- B. C. 133 -RRB- the last of his descendants bequeathed the city and state of
Pergamon	LOCATION	to the Romans .

		It is improbable that they would do much to increase the library , though they evidently took care of it , for
ninety years later	DATE	, when
Mark Antony	PERSON	is said to have given it to
Cleopatra	LOCATION	, the number of works in it amounted to two hundred thousand . ''

		Classical allusions to collections of books in
Greece	LOCATION	are scanty and disappointing , merely proving the existence of such collections .

		Strabo , as cited by our author , preserves a tra - dition that
Aristotle	PERSON	was the first to make a collection of books , and that he taught the kings of
Egypt	LOCATION	how to arrange a library .

		Hadrian 's
Stoa	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	is the only ancient building in the nature of a library that we know of in that city .

		Its ground plan and
Pausanias	PERSON	's brief allusion to it are given by Mr.
Clark	PERSON	.

		But when we come to
Rome	LOCATION	we find more abundant material for study .

		No fewer than twenty-six public libraries are said to have flourished there , at one time or another , under the Em - pire , and earlier private collections are known to have existed .

		The public libraries first found shelter in temples .

		An interesting passage from
Aulus Gellius	PERSON	is quoted , concerning the library at Tibur , which is seen to have been housed in the temple of Hercules .

		Seneca -LRB- De Tran - quillitate Animi , ix . -RRB-

		is drawn upon for a para - graph throwing much light on the collection and care of books .

		He says : '' Forty thousand books were burnt at
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		I leave others to praise this splendid monument of royal opulence , as for example
Livy	PERSON	, who regards it as ' a noble work of royal taste and royal thoughtfulness . '

		It was not taste , it was not thoughtfulness , it was learned extravagance -- nay , not even learned , for they had bought their books for the sake of show , not for the sake of learning , -- just as with many who are ignorant , even of the lowest branches of learning books are not instruments of study , but ornaments of dining-rooms .

		Procure then as many books as will suffice for use ; but not a single one for show ... Excess in all directions is bad .

		Why should you excuse a man who wishes to possess book-presses inlaid with arbor-vkce wood or ivory ; who gathers together masses of authors either unknown or discredited ; who yawns among his thou - sands of books ; and who derives his chief delight from their edges and their tickets ?

		You will find then in the libraries of the most arrant idlers all that orators or historians have written -- book-cases built up as high as the ceiling .

		Nowadays a library takes rank with a bathroom as a necessary ornament of a house .

		I could forgive such ideas , if they were due to extravagant desire for learning .

		As it is these productions of men whose genius we revere , paid for at a high price , witb their portraits ranged in line above them , are got to - gether to adorn and beautify a wall . ''

		By far the greater part of Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's book is devoted to mediaeval libraries .

		Why he chose for his title-page '' the end of the eight - eenth century '' as indicatmg the limit of hia labors , is a little puzzling , since his volume closes with an account of the library of
John Boys	PERSON	, Dean of
Canterbury	LOCATION	, who died in
1625	DATE	, and very few references are made to a later period .

		The splendors of the
Vatican Library	ORGANIZATION	receive due attention at his hands , both in text and in illustration .

		But it is in the occasional excursions to one side of the main theme that the general reader will find most of real human interest .

		Apropos of monastic libraries , we have the following , from
St. Benedict	LOCATION	's Rule : `` Idleness is the enemy of the soul ; hence brethren ought , at certain seasons , to occupy themselves with manual labour , and again , at certain seasons , with holy reading ... Between Easter and the calends of Oc - tober let them apply themselves to reading from the fourth hour till near the sixth hour .

		From the calends of
October	DATE	to the beginning of Lent let them apply themselves to reading till the second hour ... During Lent let them apply themselves to reading from morning until the end of the third hour ... and , in these days of Lent , let them receive a book apiece from the library , and read it straight through .

		These books are to be given out at the beginning of Lent . ''

		Thus it appears that monastic librarians , no less than public librarians of the present day , had their labors increased at the Lenten season ^ Monastic libraries were , in fact , the public libraries of the Middle Ages ; and that no re - ligious house was considered complete without its case of books is evident from the old epi - gram , ''
Claustrum	PERSON	sine armario , castrum sine armamentario . ''

		The chaining of books , the pledges exacted for their safe return when lent , , and , quaintest of all , the elaborate curses in -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 scribed , as a deterrent to book-thieves , in mediaeval volumes , all bear witness to the high value put upon these literary treasures in an age when books were few and costly .

		Most readers will be surprised to learn that wall-shelves did not come into use , for libraries , until the six - teenth century ; before that time the shelves were placed at right angles to the wall .

		In this brief sketch scant justice can be done to the work under review .

		Its full treatment of ancient and mediaeval library appliances , with copious photographic illustrations , can only be alluded to here .

		Abundant foot-notes serve the purpose of a bibliography , and a dozen pages of index close the volume .

		Our only disappointment is to find that , despite the somewhat comprehensive claims of title-page and prospectus , so many of the world-renowned libraries remain untouched upon by the author .

		Perhaps they were not deemed by him illustra - tive of his subject .

		The British Museum Li - brary , the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	, the national libraries at
Florence	LOCATION	and
Naples	LOCATION	and
Madrid	LOCATION	, the Imperial Public Library at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	and that at
Vienna	LOCATION	, the royal libraries at
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Munich	LOCATION	and
Brussels	LOCATION	, the university libraries of
Leyden	LOCATION	,
Utrecht	LOCATION	,
Louvain	LOCATION	, Bo - logna , -- all of these , and a dozen more that might be named , are shut out in the cold .

		But it would be both rash and ungracious to criticize the learned author 's choice of material , after he has laboriously gleaned for us so rich a harvest of curious and valuable information from sources that are in many cases by no means easy of access .

		One hundred and fifty - six illustrations , including forty-three full-page plates , adorn the text ; and the wide margins , clear print , and substantial binding , all con - tribute their share toward clothing a scholarly work in a becoming garb .

		Percy Favor
Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The ViGOROUS Dr. Smol.l.ett .

		*
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	late in his life -LRB- he died in
1889	DATE	-RRB- declared that no publisher would dare risk a complete edition of Smollett or
Sterne	PERSON	.

		He had in mind the coarseness of those eight - eenth century writers .

		Yet here , not many years after , is a handsome complete edition of the former and perhaps more objectionable *
Thk	ORGANIZATION	Works of
Tobias Smollett	PERSON	.

		With an Introduction by
W. E. Henley	PERSON	, In twelve volumes .

		Illustrated in photo - gravure .


New York	LOCATION	: Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		author , in twelve volumes , of the large-paper , illustrated , sumptuous kind , , and inclusive even of the odds and ends of the vigorous Dr.
Smol	PERSON	- lett 's works .

		The appearance of such an edition seems to mean an interesting change in the public taste in English fiction .

		It indicates in the first place that , owing no doubt to the prevalence of much realistic writing of the plain-spoken sort , we are now more sympathetic to the coarse , more tolerant of the occasional foul , than we were , say , a quarter of a century ago .

		Again , there is in all probability more interest on the part of the public in fiction as such than was true earlier ; the Novel to-day is more fiercely dominant than it was when
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	died , only a dozen years ago .

		Hence this in - terest , acting retrospectively , includes a novel - ist of one hundred and fifty years ago like
Smollett	PERSON	.

		And yet again : the critical and scholarly attention paid to this typical modern form of literature has had its effect in drawing the gen - eral reader 's attention to older work ; and the fact that fiction is now studied commonly m college courses attracts to the eighteenth cen - tury men who founded and shaped the Novel attention at once earnest and intelligent .

		Na doubt all these influences may be operative in making such a mercantile venture as a fine definitive edition of Smollett advisable , even profitable .

		I would in no wise imply by these reflections the slight importance of
Tobias Smollett	PERSON	.

		He was vastly enjoyed as a story - teller in his day , as he was well-hated as a man ; he is a by no means slender link in the evolu - tion of English fiction ; and , which is the main thing for the present-day reader , he can still be read in his best books with hearty relish .

		To be sure , both
Richardson	PERSON	and Fielding are more important in the fictional development , coming earlier and being greater novelists .

		Yet it may well be questioned if , for handing on the story of episode and picaresque adventure -- a branch of fiction now much in evidence in current story-making --
Smollett	PERSON	is not more directly in the line of Cervantes ,
LeSage	PERSON	, and
Defoe	PERSON	than even Fielding .

		There is , too , a certain benefit , in these days of extravagant statement regarding living and very new novel - writers , in looking back at the by-gone wor - thies in order to realize that , after all , brave men lived before Agamemnon : that superla - tives steadily used lose their emphasis .

		Nine of the dozen volumes comprising this new edition are taken up by
Smollett	ORGANIZATION	's major 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, stories : ''
Roderick Eandom	PERSON	, '' ''
Peregrine Pickle	PERSON	, '' `` Ferdinand , Count Fathom , '' and * '
Humphrey Clinker	PERSON	. ''

		The generous type and large-paper form necessitates two volumes for each novel , -- three in the case of '' Pickle . ''

		To handle such books sets one on dreams of the good old leisurely days of the three-decker , when hurry was not in writer or reader .

		The remaining three volumes contain such minor things as the tale called `` Sir
Lancelot Greaves	PERSON	, '' the travels and miscellanies in verse and prose , only of value to the student who would trace the novelist 's growth and de - cadence and have a fuller understanding of the man .

		Smollett 's very bad dramas , here printed , bring a realization of how ill it fares with the cobbler who leaves his last .

		The introduction is written by Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	, who is just now in the public eye be - cause of his churlish , curious exhibition of bad taste in attempting to throw disillusionment upon his old-time fellow in life and literature ,
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Trenchant critic and true poet Mr.
Henley	PERSON	is , however ; and this bit of criticism is in his familiar jerkily brilliant and bookish style .

		Those who expect a critic to show cause why he takes the trouble to bow some piece of literature into their presence , may perhaps wonder that Mr.
Henley	PERSON	was selected to do this task ; he is savage enough with Dr.
Smollett	PERSON	, who is not to be numbered among his literary loves , and who , as a man , he exposes in all his weakness .

		But there is much to stimulate the student in what he says , and in the final summing-up full credit is given the eighteenth century story-teller 's contribu - tion to English fiction ; especially does he praise him for his high spirits and vividness of char - acter drawing -LRB- in which
Dickens	PERSON	was later to imitate and surpass him -RRB- .

		One of the most interesting things about
Smollett	PERSON	, by the way , is the fact that he was confessedly a favorite with
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, and that there is a cer - tain resemblance of method and manner -LRB- inter - vallo longo -RRB- between the older man and his far greater successor .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	, too , very prop - erly compliments
Smollett	PERSON	on his initiating truthful pictures of the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	, -- a field afterwards cultivated with admirable results by
Marryat	LOCATION	; and quite as properly points out
Smollett	PERSON	's lack of proportion and construction in his stories , his tendency to caricature , his absence of high ideals .

		He makes the story of his literary life dramatic by leading up to the best novel , ''
Humphrey Clinker	PERSON	, '' published the year of his death . ''

		So passed the old stark pagan , '' says Mr.
Henley	PERSON	, with a sort of grim approval : in fact , one feels there must be some sympathy between the seamy , vigorous novelist and the poet who in the splendid lines beginning '' Out of the
Night	TIME	that Covers Me , '' preaches a doctrine of agnostic stoicism .

		In his relative placing of the novels , with ''
Humphrey Clinker	PERSON	'' at their head , Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's judgment is sound , and he pulls the second-rate work to pieces with a roughness such as
Smollett	PERSON	was wont himself to use in regard of others .

		The critic speaks of his '' stinks and nastinesses , '' of how in '' The Ad - ventures of an Atom '' '' he bemerded every - thing and everybody , '' -- until the reader at times wonders in which century Mr.
Henley	PERSON	belongs , -- the eighteenth or nineteenth .

		Truth to tell , this latter day writer is no more for squeamish stomachs than is the novelist he introduces .

		Of the four main novels of
Smollett	ORGANIZATION	, three , -- ``
Roderick Random	PERSON	, '' `` Peregrine Pickle , '' and ''
Humphrey Clinker	PERSON	, '' -- are still well - known and read .

		The fourth , '' Sir
Lancelot Greaves	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Henley	PERSON	dispatches in a charac - teristic manner : '' I have said nothing of it , '' he remarks , '' for the simple reason that I find so little merit in it that I have no more to say , '' -- which is a good example of modern impressionist criticism , though accurate enough so far as the work in question is concerned .

		Of the other stories , `` Roderick Random '' is important because -LRB- like
Dickens	PERSON	's ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' -RRB- it is more autobiographic than his other books , and has some telling portraits ; ''
Peregrine Pickle	ORGANIZATION	'' is a better novel , having less exaggeration , and on the whole more of unity -- although disfigured by the episodic '' Memoirs of a Lady of Quality . ''

		In these books and in '' Clinker , '' the latter written when he was physically broken , such characters as Bowling and
Bramble	PERSON	and Pipes have names of the conjuring kind -- and , surely , a fiction - ist 's power in permanent portraiture is what gives him a lasting place .

		In '' Clinker , '' too , the usual faults are minimized .

		There is a '' go '' to the book , and indeed in the other two , a hearty participation of the author in the life depicted , that produces an answering effect upon the reader and is a mark of our elder fic - tion in contrast with the modern method , which places the author coldly outside of and aloof from his creations , it being deemed a sign of literary bad breeding to obtrude himself or show personal interest in his puppets .

		Which - ever way is best , few will fail to relish this
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 earlier hearty abandonment in the work .

		Of the diction of Smollett it should be said that he has the great gift of making his personages talk in character and exhibit themselves through • dialogue rather than by description .

		In comparing a novelist like
Smollett	PERSON	with the best in English fiction to-day , the final thought , nevertheless , is likely to be -- with all recognition of his talent and sturdy force -- that the gains in both art and ethics have been substantial .

		The careless rough-and-tumble < iisplay of venality , profligacy , and brutality in these eighteenth century pages is all uncon - sciously a revelation of how far we have since advanced in decency , in refinement , in spiritual ideals .

		And quite as truly , the progress in the technique of novel-making since
Smollett	PERSON	's time is a matter for satisfaction .

		No novelist of our day has more genius for fiction than had Henry • Fielding ; but all novelists of the first rank now will avoid Fielding 's defects and those of his contemporaries : the carelessness of con - struction in the bringing in of loose , rambling episodic material ; the failure to respect truth rather than theatric effect of scene and char - acter ; the lapses from the clean , the frank catering to gutter tastes ; the clumsiness in attempting to make dialectic or other varia - tions from normal English speech .

		Yet , since life is more than art , those earlier novelists often have an effect of power , of reality , of the atmosphere that makes for illusion , that has not since been surpassed .

		And
Smollett	PERSON	, in his obvious faults and equally obvious virtues , stands at Fielding 's shoulder , a doughty lieu - tenant of that incomparable captain .

Sloane	PERSON	's new volume was delivered in a course of eight lectures be - fore the
Union Theological Seminary of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		Considered as lectures before a distinctly professional body , interested primarily in the relations of church and state in a critical period of history , the point of view of the author would not require extended examination .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons .

		treme statement of the thesis maintained by the author attract instant attention .

		Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	's thesis , as presented in his pre - face , is that historians have overestimated the political and social causes of the Revolution , and of the spasmodic progressions in that Re - volution ; that in considering the conditions which checked the normal course of reform , undue emphasis has been placed on national bankruptcy , secular feudalism , and the '' mys - terious , secret upheaval attributed to mental exaltation , of which so much has been sug - gested and hinted , but about which nothing is known . ''

		Later it is admitted in the body of the work that the interference of foreign powers was a potential factor in hurrying
France	LOCATION	into excesses , yet neither this nor all other causes combined equalled in intensity that '' mightiest obstructive force ... ecclesiastical fanaticism both positive and negative . ''

		In the character and organization of the church and in its arti - ficial connection with the state , Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	finds the conditions that most irritated the reformers of
France	LOCATION	.

		In the stubborness of the higher clergy in clinging to lucrative abuses upon which they fattened , he discovers the main source of the fatal contentions of the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the struggle between the honest fanaticism of the lower clergy upon the one side , and the equally honest fanaticism of the theoretical reformers of church and faith upon the other , the author finds the cru - cial antagonisms which , developing into bitter hatred , wrecked the cause of moderate reform .

		In brief , questions of church and religion are depicted as causative to a greater degree than any other , both in the inception and in the progress of the French Revolution .

		Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	's work is a delight to the student of history for its scholarly method , its keen analysis , and its choice language .

		It carries with it the impression of thorough research , and of exact and painstaking intellectual hon - esty .

		It presents in more logical form than has hitherto been offered in English , the mental attitude of churchmen and reformers in
France	LOCATION	, and the incidents which made evident that at - titude .

		Hence it is that anything approaching a criticism of the book as a whole is undertaken with extreme diffidence , for so masterly a work in general deserves only critical approbation .

		Nevertheless , if the author 's thesis is rightly understood , it is impossible to accept without question the conclusions presented .

		Is it not possible that Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	has elevated occasions into causes ; and that , judging events uncon - 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb.	DATE	.

		U sciously distorted , he may have misapprehended their true relation ?

		It is no doubt true that immediately before
1789	DATE	questions of clerical privilege and of the badly adjusted relations of church and state formed a considerable part of the general topic of reform agitating the circles in which such affairs were being dis - cussed .

		Yet these circles included but a small proportion of the people of
France	LOCATION	, for , as Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	freely recognizes , the majority of Frenchmen were fairly well satisfied with exist - ing church conditions .

		But even if we go so far as to admit that the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of
1789	DATE	ranked first in importance the renovation of the church by the curtailing of unjust priv - ileges , it does not follow that the subsequent contests over religion and religious organiza - tion constituted the central essential struggle in the battle of factions , nor is that historical per - spective necessarily correct which exhibits the violence and license of the Revolution as due to repeated conflicts between religious partisans .

		It will be admitted that the French Revo - lution , however unique in many particulars , had this in common with all other revolutions or similar periods of public exaltation -- that the Revolution itself became the God of the revolutionists .

		It was idealized , incarnated ; it became the Great Cause without any true conception of the principles for which it stood , or the point to which it tended .

		When after
1789	DATE	it became evident that the hoped-for po - litical and social millenium was not to be im - mediately realized , and that the Cause was in danger of failing in its objects , determined opposition , either secret or open , was immedi - ately suspected , and the attempt made to remove the obstacle .

		Gradually the religion of revo - lution increased its hold upon the people , and the removal of obstacles to progress became more and more a matter of vengeance .

		After the flight of the Emigres , the Church was the only existing body in
France	LOCATION	which stood for that most hated thing , the ancient Regime .

		When , therefore , hopes and expectations were frustrated , and prophecies of social and polit - ical betterment were unfulfilled , promoters and preachers of revolution sought a cause .

		It is not strange that they attributed failure to the secret opposition of the clergy .

		The result was a series of violent and embittered attacks upon the clergy and upon religion itself .

		This violence , displayed by each successive faction in control of the government of
France	LOCATION	up to
1795	DATE	, was not , as Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	maintains , caused by the stubborn opposition of clerics and people to projects of reform , nor was the general vio - lence of the Revolution due to that cause .

		The attack upon the Church and upon the Catholic religion was essentially due to the blind desire to find a scapegoat .

		The general and increasing tendency to violent methods was partly the result of the purely selfish machinations of politicians , partly an exhibition of that des - pairing fanaticism which dared any excess in the worship of its God -- the Revolution .

		The clergy and the ancient faith were in truth bit - terly assailed and unjustly charged with the failure of the radical programme .

		But do the debates and agitations over church and faith prove that questions of church organization , and of religious belief , were in themselves the vital causes of contentions ?

		Is there not great reason to regard these contentions as exhibi - tions of the inherent violence of the party in .

		power , which , seeking a scapegoat , found it in the Church , -- the only remaining repre - sentative of the ancient monarchy .

		If this view is correct , if the angry debates on religion , the rapid and startling changes in church organization and in faith , were les '' causes of excesses than occasions of them , then Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	's proposition is not convincingly proved .

		In undertaking a specialized study for a limited audience and upon a limited topic , ^ he has seemingly fallen into the specialist 's error of over-estimating the importance of the particular subject investigated , at the expense of other and equally potent factors .

		Never - theless , while it seems impossible to accept the extreme statements of the author of the causa - tive position occupied by questions of religious reform after
1789	DATE	, it is still but just to credit him with having proved that somewhat greater importance , than has been customary with his - torians , should be attached to the religious situation after that date .

		The Classification of Books .

		* In the early part of last year , the
Librarian of Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Ernest C. Rich	PERSON	- ardson , was invited to deliver before the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	, under the auspices of the
Alumni	ORGANIZATION	, two lectures on the science and art of classification .

		These lectures proved so notable a contribution to the subject that their appearance in book form , with the added * Classification , Theoretical and Practical .

		By
Ernest Gushing Richardson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 virtues of an Introduction and an Appendix containing an '' Essay towards a Bibliograph - ical History of Systems of Classification , '' is a matter for congratulation among library work - ers .

		Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	's work not only reflects great credit upon himself as a high type of the scholarly librarian , but fully justifies the wis - dom of the
Alumni Association	ORGANIZATION	in instituting these valuable lectures .

		It may be said at the outset that the book is in no sense elementary or technical , but pre - supposes on the part of the reader a fair acquaintance with practical library systems .

		Indeed , the first lecture , on '' The Order of the Sciences , '' is sufficiently formidable even to the trained librarian , with its '' mirroring of the outer cosmos , '' its '' complex of ions , '' and so forth ; yet with all its rather profound phi - losophical and theoretical character it does nevertheless present in a very sound scientific way the true order of the sciences , and should be of distinct value to the librarian as a theo - retical basis of classification .

		However , it is in the second lecture , devoted to '' The Classification of Books , '' that the book reaches , in our opinion , its greatest inter - est and value .

		The subject is treated in a fascinating and stimulating manner which must arouse feelings of gratitude to the author in the mind of every thoughtful librarian , and can not fail to be extremely helpful in creating a practical and at the same time scientific atti - tude toward the work of classification .

		The importance of classification to the library and to the reading world is given brief but ade - quate notice , and the '' Decimal '' and '' Expan - sive '' systems come in for their due share of praise .

		Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	concludes his notice of these two systems with the following words , which may serve at the same time as a helpful stimulus to every librarian engaged in classifi - catory work .

		`` As classification itself is the highest function of the librarian 's work , calling into play every faculty and every attainment of knowledge , -- the acme of bibliothecal work , -- so these two systems of classification mark the high-water line of American library science , and are the climax of its achievement . ''

		As an Appendix the author gives an excel - lent and fairly complete bibliography of classi - fication systems from the time of Plato to the present day , in many cases including an out - line of the system advocated .

		Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	's book should be hailed as a most welcome addition to the literature of library science .


Clarence W. Perley	PERSON	.

		An '' Everyday JLwe '' of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	's life of
Washington	LOCATION	is sufficiently unlike all others of the many that have been written to warrant its publication .

		It may be called an every-day life of the first American , as distinguished from those that give only the dignified and the formal in his life .

		Yet it is not like the '' true '' lives that are so popular just now , for it does not confine itself to the trifles that are not worth preserving and to recounting the shortcomings of its subject and the charges that hostile venom may have concocted during the bitter struggles of that most bitter period of our national history .

		Mis - takes and shortcomings are not passed over , even the trivial things that throw light upon
Washington	LOCATION	's character are not wanting ; but these do not make up the whole story .

		They appear in the proportion of real life .

		This treatment distinguishes Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's book , and gives it strength and interest .

		It is not a political nor a military biography , , though , of course , the military and the politi - cal sides of
Washington	LOCATION	's life are given in due proportion .

		But they are given in a general way ; important battles are sometimes dismissed in a line , or are left unmentioned .

		Great pol - icies are passed over , or get but a word .

		It is , .

		rather , a setting forth of the personal life and character of the man to whom Americans have given the first place in their esteem , if not in their love , whom the whole world considers one of the consummate flowers of the Anglo-Saxon race .

		The formal
Washington	LOCATION	, the demi-god of the older biographies , is not here .

		The hu - man element is made prominent , the tone being ^ throughout sympathetic and appreciative .

		It is realistic and distinctly modern in manner , yet fair and well-balanced , giving the nobler side of the life and shattering no sane ideals of our national hero .

		Perhaps the most valuable service rendered by the book is the opportunity it gives the reader to see the development in
Washington	LOCATION	's character .

		His childhood was ordinary ; '' not until the time for deeds does any touch of dis - tinction appear . '' ''

		This poverty might be ascribed to chance , and to barren witnesses , were it not that , for many years after
Washington	LOCATION	became conspicuous in action , the accessi - ble expressions of this personality were so bare that their interest depends wholly on his importance ... That his learning was small is not to be attributed to scant opportunity , since he never showed much hunger *

		`` 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, for books , and many famous men , who later surrounded and obeyed him , won more education against greater odds . ''

		He seems to have had but a short boyhood and no free youth .

		At sixteen he was a public sur - veyor , enduring the hardships of that profes - sion in the wilderness .

		At the same age , his journal , with the formal sentiments of a pre - mature manhood , contains references to a `` low - land beauty , '' confirming other indications of a later period that his heart was extremely susceptible to feminine charms .

		At nineteen he was made adjutant-general -LRB- ^ with the rank of major -RRB- in one of the four military districts of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and at twenty he inherited
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	through the death of his brother .

		At twenty-one his public life began with his famous mission to warn the intruding French at
Fort Duquesne	LOCATION	, and the next year he fired the shot that was heard around the world and set a large part of it aflame with war .

		During his earlier life , we find him displaying many human traits .

		He was insistent in demand - ing promotion , and not backward in informing those in authority of his services .

		He was a stickler for every point of '' honor , '' and had to be tactfully managed to prevent his resigna - tion .

		He was ready to make statements to the Indians that are charitably called '' fictions '' to get them to do as he wished .

		He was obstin - ate for his opinion ; it was said by an associate , on one occasion , that `` his behavior about the roads was noways like a soldier . ''

		He was some - times ready to blame the other side for doing the very thing that he was trying to do .

		He was much fonder of giving advice than he was of taking it .

		All of this goes to show only that the great qualities had to grow in him as they have to grow in other great men .

		The young
Washington	LOCATION	was neither sage nor saint , though he was a remarkably forceful and effi - cient young man ; the common ideal of him was realized only in his later life .

		We think of
Washington	LOCATION	as a grave , stern man ; he was this , except in the inner circle of friendship , and through most of his career a gloom seemed to rest upon him that was partly natural and partly caused by the almost impossible burdens that he was called upon to bear , which were made heavier by ill-health .

		If all Americans had been self-sacrificing pa - triots like himself , as we fondly used to think they were , the burdens of his military and of his civil life would have been comparatively light .

		But as a general , he had to work with soldiers that were untrained and without arms or supplies , too many of whom were insubor - dinate and even cowardly ; too many of his officers were incompetent , foisted upon the army through political intrigue , or cowardly or greedy .

		Officers intrigued against him ; the soldiers abandoned the army in regiments at critical moments .

		The States were jealous of one another , and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was incompetent .

		And as President , he had to suffer from the same popular vices , though they were differ - ently manifested .

		It was through the fires of such trials that his patience was developed , his wisdom and tact were perfected , and all the lower forms of ambition were eliminated from his character .

		But who can wonder that his terrible responsibilities , together with the evils against which he had to contend , oppressed him and shadowed his life with gloom ?

		He lacked the sense of humor that enabled Lin - coln to throw off for a time even heavier bur - dens and preserve the elasticity of his mind .

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's judgments upon the charac - ter and work of
Washington	LOCATION	are sympathetic and sound , and we are tempted to quote some of them in conclusion of our notice . ''

		It was this combination of a passionate nature , in - cluding an aggressive , dominating will , with an intensely just and ethical spirit , that made it possible for him to have one of the rarest and greatest of his qualities -- the unequalled dignity of his presence ... The eulogies of him are full of immortal tributes to the worth of blood and judgment well commingled .

		Per - haps it is largely because , although passionate , he was not passion 's slave , that the world has worn him in its heart 's core .

		With such a character , and without genius , he needed occasion to show his worth ... Without great events ,
Washington	LOCATION	would not have been famous ; and , on the other hand , he made events great by his ability in meeting them .

		It does not follow because a man is of the type that waits for occasions that he does less to mould history ... Goodness is universal rather than peculiar , and the greatness of
Washington	LOCATION	had its base in the power to be largely and impressively right .

		... Born to lead some of the most difficult movements of history , he saw only the things which were , and his life illustrates the sublimity that truth and strength may reach without beauty or imagination ... Wash - ington 's appeal has been great to the masses , because he was a hero ; not less strong to the first minds of all nations , also because he was a hero , but different from the rest .

		It is to the merely clever that he must fre - quently seem dull .

		Those to whom
Washington	LOCATION	seems good but uninteresting perhaps need an argument that goodness and interest are inseparable ; that large Tight - ness is , maturely seen , the foremost human trait .

		With this moral justness in
Washington	LOCATION	went courage ... If
Washington	LOCATION	's name is as great as any in the annals of political history , it is because of deeds which the world values now even more than it did a hundred years ago .

		His was a noble nature , with a sanity , a balance , a power of endurance , seldom rivalled ; but his glory is not mainly personal .

		It is not primarily the effulgence
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 8T of some rare and individual superiority .

		It is universal .

		It is the concentration in a man of those merits which are most needed in the rulers of mankind .

		It is the triumph of integrity , of patience , of courage , of loyalty in the service of his country .

		It is because he was with constancy for the right , and so powerful in its service , that he has such honor from the world .

		Only great talents could have accomplished what Washing - ton accomplished ; but no genius alone , however pro- digious , could fill that place in the world 's history which is held by
Washington	LOCATION	's clearness of view and unbend - ing moral strength . ''

		and is lost .

		We can at least recommend this book as suitable for
Sunday	DATE	school libraries .

		Just what it is doing in the `` American Novel Series '' remains a mystery . ''

		The Debatable Land '' is an impressionistic story of the Civil War .

		The narrative is found in streaks , imbedded in a matrix of futile philosophical musings .

		The scene of the story is first placed in the neighborhood of
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and then transferred to the
Shenandoah Valley	LOCATION	at the time of the Peninsular Campaign .

		The characters and their motives are throughout hinted at rather than defined , and most of the threads of the interest are dropped without being unravelled .

		The book is a very unsatisfactory performance , and brings the series to anything but a brilliant conclusion .

		Re - viewing the series as a whole , we must say that it represents a good idea badly carried out .

		Such unevenness is not often found in a set of books that are intended to have some sort of uniform excel - lence .

		There are two really fine novels among the dozen , ''
Martin Brook	PERSON	, '' by the late
Morgan Bates	PERSON	, and '' Days Like These , '' by Mr.
E. W. Townsend	PERSON	.

		Four others may be called tolerably good novels , but the rest have no reasonable excuse for exist - ence .

		We judge that the publishers , having seen their way to give the series a fair start , trusted to luck for its completion .

		If so , it must be admitted that luck deserted them upon a number of occa - sions .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's new novel , `` The Cavalier , '' is a story of our Civil War as viewed from the stand - point of the Confederate soldier .

		The scene is laid in
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and the action is concerned with raids , skirmishes , and bushwhacking , rather than with the pitched battles and the larger aspects of the struggle .

		There is little of the war passion in its pages , and no rhetorical exploitation of the great issues of the struggle .

		The soldiers do their fight - ing as a matter of business , and the real interest of the story is private rather than public or historical . ''

		The Cavalier '' is not an easy book to read .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	has always had the fault of supersubtlety , .

		and never more noticeably than in this case .

		He rarely tells a story or exhibits a character in plain * terms , and even the minor incidents are related by indirection .

		We are constantly puzzled to under - stand his argument , and to view his figures in the - right light .

		If Mr.
Cable	PERSON	were not so very charm - ing a writer , this quality would be fatal ; as it is , we find it exasperating , but are unwilling to miss the refined art and the delicate sensibility that are - characteristic of his work . ''

		Circumstance , '' Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's new novels seems somewhat dull in the opening chapters , and we expect from it little more than agreeable enter - tainment in the society of the respectable
Philadel	LOCATION	- phians whom it presents to the view .

		But presently , and in spite of the essentially commonplace people who figure in its pages , we become conscious of a quickening of interest , which reaches a considerable degree of intensity as we approach the end .

		In the 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, adventuress and her scapegrace brother , whose con - duct serves to relieve the good breeding and refine - ment of the other characters , we have two singularly effective examples of skilful delineative art ; while the characters who represent respectability soon develop interesting individualities , owing to the analysis which gradually brings out the finer shad - ings of their thought and temperament .

		The ad - venturess is the chief figure in this drama of private interests , and she is almost worthy to be placed by the side of
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, whom she resembles in her feline ways and her heartless selfishness , but from whom she is differentiated by the possession of criminal instincts .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	is to be con - gratulated upon the sterling excellence of this novel , and upon the success with which he has handled his diflBcult material , creating a strictly legitimate in - terest which does not depend upon exaggeration or sensationalism for its effect .

		It is not a brilliant book , but brilliancy is an easy achievement as com - pared with the social insight of this novel .

		Dr.
James M. Ludlow	PERSON	, who won a deserved rep - utation about fifteen years ago with a historical novel of the days of
Scanderbeg	LOCATION	, has gone still far - ther back in history for the theme of his '' De - borah , '' which is a romance of the time of
Judas Maccabaeus	ORGANIZATION	, and which deals with the revolt of that great leader against the oppressions of Antiochus Epiphanes .

		The conquest of the Greek by the Jew , and the triumphant occupation of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	by Judas and his followers , offers material for a highly-colored and effective story .

		Of this mate - rial Dr.
Ludlow	PERSON	has made good use , and his por - trayal of the Jewish champion is a masterly piece of characterization .

		His heroine and her Greek lover -LRB- who turns out in the end to be also of Jew - ish birth -RRB- are sympathetically-conceived figures , although we must say that the portraits of the hero - ine , which serve the book for illustrations , are too evidently photographs of a modern girl in mas - querade costume to suggest the
Deborah	PERSON	of the romance .

		Dr.
Ludlow	PERSON	's diction , although inspired by biblical phraseology , now and then makes an un - fortunate descent from the exalted level demanded by such a book , and becomes mere twentieth cen - tury American .

		Archaeological faithfulness is out of the question in any book of this sort , but a cer - tain conventional artificiality is required for the purposes of the illusion , and from this the author too frequently lapses .

		Nevertheless , the story is a conscientious piece of workmanship , and fulfils most of the demands of romantic historical fiction .

		Mr.
William Stearns Davis	PERSON	is the author of a romance of the
First Crusade	ORGANIZATION	, with the historical cry of the crusaders for its title .

		Except for '' Count Robert of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' the author says , this most interesting of all the crusades has not been put into a novel .

		It seems strange that the oppor - tunity has been neglected , yet we can not from our recollection controvert the statement . ''

		God Wills It ! ''

		may best be described by saying that it makes much the same sort of impression as do the Polish historical romances of Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		The author has saturated himself in the history of the period , and has besides rich stores of imagination upon which to draw .

		Contrasting the book with Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's crusaders ' story of a year or two ago , for example , we get some idea of its remarkable qualities .

		In the comparison , Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's book is pale while this is glowing , it is mechanical while this is living , it is grudging of its gifts while this is lavish in its largess .

		Most important of all , while Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's romance is little more than mildly exciting , this romance of Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is thrilling throughout , and the effect is produced by legitimate means , not by any resort to sensationalism .

		These remarks are meant to be high praise , for such '' God Wills It ! ''

		deserves .

		It spreads before us a magnificent panorama of both historical and human interest ; it has for its background
France	LOCATION	, and
Sicily	LOCATION	, and the gorgeous East ; it has for episodes the preaching of
Peter	PERSON	, the siege of
Antioch	LOCATION	, and the capture of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	; it has for characters
Godfrey	PERSON	, and
Raymond	PERSON	and
Tancred	PERSON	and
Robert	PERSON	of
Normandy	LOCATION	.

		It is , moreover , historically just in its weighing of the forces -- religious fanaticism , economic pressure , and personal valor -- that de - termined the course and the consequences of the crusading movement .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's new novel , ''
Marietta	PERSON	, '' is some - thing more than fiction .

		It is a tale of
Venice	LOCATION	in the fifteenth century , and makes us acquainted with the famous glass-makers ,
Angelo Beroviero	PERSON	and
Zorzi Ballerin	PERSON	.

		Even the heroine , the daughter of Angelo , whom
Zorzi	PERSON	wins despite paternal oppo - sition and a contemplated alliance with a noble family , is a character of actual history .

		Still , the interest of the romance is essentially private , and the material is handled in Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's most charming manner .

		His knowledge of Italian life , both present and past , is so intimate that he is en - abled to invest his figures with much vitality .

		That the book is one of invention coupled with observa - tion , rather than one of mere manufacture , is the pre - dominant impression that it makes upon us , which can not be said , for example , of '' Via Crucis , '' or certain others of Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's later writings .

		Mr.
Charlton Andrews	PERSON	is a new writer of histor - ical romance , and his book with a Chaucerian title , '' A
Parfit Gentil Knight	PERSON	, '' is a highly creditable first production .

		Its scene is the French court of Charles IX .

		and the Queen-Mother , its historical setting is the strife between Catholics and
Hugue	PERSON	- nots , culminating in the Massacre .

		The young
Duke of Guise	ORGANIZATION	and the Prince of
Anjou	LOCATION	are among the chief characters introduced , and are about evenly matched as exemplars of villainy concealed beneath the courtly graces .

		The hero is a brave soldier , attached to the Prince of Montpensier , loving the princess with an unsullied devotion and finally giving his life for her .

		He is indeed '' a verray parfit gentil knight , '' although his nobility of soul is possibly a trifle over-emphasized -- in the
Marquis	PERSON	of Posa fashion .

		Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	has told an inter -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 esting story , full of moving or exciting incident , And well-sustained as it leads up to its climax .

		We said some few weeks ago that the Indian was coming back into American fiction .

		Two un - usually good Indian stories with a historical back - ground have recently been published , and give • further evidence of the truth of our earlier state - ment . ''

		The Road to Frontenac , '' by Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	, is a straightforward story of new
France	LOCATION	at the close of the seventeenth century .

		The hero is a French oflBcer sent from
Quebec	LOCATION	to Frontenac on an important mission , and incidentally charged with the escort of a young woman .

		The journey up the river provides a sufficiency of adventure to ` fill the book and keep its readers wide awake all the time .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	succeeds very well in his management of the picturesque and metaphorical language which , according to the accepted conven - tion since the days of
Cooper	PERSON	, was used by the Indians in their harangues .

		The main thing is to be sustained and consistent in its use , and in this the author has been successful .

		His hero is a very doughty person indeed , who can out-talk the most eloquent of the braves .

		As for the love-story , it • may easily be imagined , since the circumstances of • the expedition make it inevitable .

		Mr.
H. A. Stanley	PERSON	, in `` The Backwoodsman , '' has told a story of the same Iroquois country , but the date is nearly a hundred years later , for the story is of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its scenes and characters are curiously coincident with those used by Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	in his '' Cardigan , '' and the comparison is unfortunate , for Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's book can not vie with that extraordinarily interesting ro - mance .

		We have the Johnsons , and the Butlers , and
Joseph Brant	PERSON	as conspicuous figures , while the hero is not unlike Cardigan in his fortunes , and in his relation to the historical happenings of the time .

		The story runs pretty well through the Rev - olutionary period , and
Sullivan	PERSON	's devastation of the Iroquois country occupies a central place .

		Mr.
Stan	PERSON	- ley 's Indian talk is of two kinds .

		There is the formal kind , which is unconvincing , because it puts such words as these on the lips of the orator : '' For peace , brothers , surely hath victories , -- bloodless victories , victories that are not symbolized by the bloody scalp . ''

		The other kind is such talk as this , which we make no doubt is the kind of language that an Indian really used : '' Captain
Brant	PERSON	, him glad Quedar choke White Skunk .

		All Mohawks glad .

		Quedar brave lad .

		Senekees all thirsty .

		Want drink blood White Oneida . ''

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's manner of narration is rather sti # E and prosaic , but he is evidently intimate with the history of his period , and knows the life of the Iroquois and the white ranger as nearly at first hand as one can know it after the lapse of a century .

		The '' tales of nature and human nature '' which > Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	has brought together under the title of `` The Ruling Passion , '' are eight in number .

		They are prefaced by a prayer , which is rather unusual for a work of fiction , but the pro- fession of the author makes it seem natural , and the good sense of the petition quite justifies the departure from precedent .

		`` Lord let me never tag a moral to a story , nor tell a story without a meaning . ''

		Not a few novelists might profit by this example .

		Ruskin once wrote in '' Fors '' : `` You might at first think that
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's divisions were narrow and artificial in assigning each circle to one sin only , as if every man did not variously commit many .

		But it is always one sin , the fa - vourite , which destroys souls .

		That conquered , all others fall with it ; that victorious , all others follow with it . ''

		Conversely , we may say that one virtue saves souls , bringing the other virtues in its train .

		This is the essential thesis presented by Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	, and he exemplifies it by studies of ruling passions as varied as the angler 's habit , the love of music , and the sacredness of a trust .

		The passion for justice is the theme of still another of these stories , and the hero is not a man , but a dog .

		The book is exquisitely written , expressive of tender sympathies and natural human feelings .

		Though the scenes and the characters are varied , '' the sub - ject is always the same , the unseen , mysterious , ruling passion weaving the stuff of human nature into patterns wherein the soul is imaged and re - vealed . ''

		The gift of gentle satire , made evident by Mr.
Henry Fuller	PERSON	's earlier novels , has been given its most effective display in '' Under the Skylights , '' a collection of three stories bearing upon the con - ditions of artistic and literary life in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It is a book h , clef , no doubt , yet the portraiture is rather typical than specific , and the traits of each character are combined by a sort of eclectic process .

		In '' The Downfall of
Abner Joyce	PERSON	, '' the type por - trayed is that of the rugged genius from the country , who comes to town with the grim determination of reforming society from its very base , who believes in himself to an absurd extent , and whose earnest - ness offers a standing rebuke to all the graces and refinements of the polite world .

		He is an uncouth product of nature , and succumbs with difficulty to the taming process .

		His '' downfall '' consists in yielding to the blandishments of a young woman of the society that it is his function to denounce , and becomes complete when , as her submissive husband , he appears at a dinner in evening clothes , and par - takes of the wine that is served at the table .

		In the story of '' Dr.
Gowdy	PERSON	and the Squash '' the type is that of the rhetorical clergyman who talks mag - niloquently about art , and imposes himself upon his followers as an authority upon subjects of which he is profoundly ignorant .

		This particular kind of humbug has never been more mercilessly exposed than in the present instance . ''

		Little
O'Grady	PERSON	vs. the
Grindstone	PERSON	, '' the third of Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's stories , relates to an artistic competition for the decoration of a bank building .

		Its teaching is that art has a poor enough chance when forced to assert its claims against the forces of social intrigue and commercial Philistinism .

		We have hesitated to give these ab -

Fuller	PERSON	's stories , because almost everything that is characteristic escapes in the process of condensation .

		An abstract of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's '' Reisebilder '' would be anything but adequate to convey a notion of the charm of that work , and for about the same reasons we must say that to read Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's book is the only way of finding out how thoroughly delightful a book it is .

		That Mr.
James B. Kenyon	PERSON	-- him - S : : ;
Tii	ORGANIZATION	```` lf ^ ^ '' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gr ^ ```` ^ '' l verse - is also an ardent admirer of others ' achievements in poetry , is made abundantly evident by his little volume of literary sketches entitled `` Loiterings in Old Fields '' -LRB-
Eaton < & ?	ORGANIZATION

		Mains -RRB- .

		That these slight essays should contain any impor - tant contribution to literary criticism is perhaps too much to expect .

		At any rate , they seem likely to profit the young student of letters rather than the more mature .

		To the latter it brings a little shock of surprise to be detained , at the mention of
George Henry Lewes	ORGANIZATION	's name , by the explanation that he '' was a student of philosophy , the author of a few philosophical treatises , and the writer of a Life of Goethe '' ; and apropos of
George Eliot	PERSON	's pen-name , to be thought in need of the following : `` We know of but one other such instance of equal interest on record , and that is of a notable French woman who for many years sent forth her writings under the fictitious name of George Sand . ''

		Moreover , in the fugitive essay , which lays no claim to depth and substance , the reader is entitled to look for something like perfection of form ; and it arouses a slight feeling of disappointment , if not of resent - ment , and an incipient distrust of the author 's nicety of taste , to open the book and find would -LRB- p. 200 -RRB- carelessly used for should , the impossible form illy -LRB- p. 122 -RRB- usurping the place of the adverb ill , and '' the tuneful ilk '' -LRB- p. 138 -RRB- chosen as a happy designation of poets as a class .

		Sweetly -LRB- p. 125 -RRB- is made to serve as an adjective , perhaps by justifiable analogy ; and , finally , a fondness for the split infinitive manifests itself .

		Dr.
Kenyon	PERSON	's inclusion of '' broad colloquialism '' among the char - acteristics of
George Eliot	PERSON	's prose style is mislead - ing , his meaning probably being that she makes her characters speak the language most natural to them .

		Although by occasional references he shows his familiarity with ''
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, he fails to in - clude that rare genius either among the noted letter - writers of our day or in the list of famous men born in the annus mirabilis ,
1809	DATE	.

		But -- to wind up , like the Hebrew prophet , with words of peace -- we have nothing bnt good to say of the chapters on
Keats	PERSON	,
Kossetti	LOCATION	, and
William Morris	PERSON	; and it is no more than fair to close with a pregnant word from the essay on
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's letters , as a pleasant after - taste : `` The writer who is not greater than his writings is a kind of impostor , for he creates in the minds of others a false conception of himself . ''

		The craft of ^ handbook on `` Bookbinding and bookbinding , and the Care of Books , '' by Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	the care of books .


Cockerell	PERSON	, with many drawings by Mr.
Noel Rooke	PERSON	, forms the initial volume of the `` Artistic Crafts Series '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		In a gen - eral preface to the series , written by the editor , Mr.
W. R. Lethaby	PERSON	, there is no mention of the fur - ther handicrafts to be given consideration , but the frequent mention of the name of
William Morris	PERSON	leads one to conjecture that all the various trades which at one time or another engaged the attention of that well-nigh universal genius will be included , -- these , of themselves , making a list fairly com - plete .

		The particular object of the series is dis - closed by Mr.
Lethaby	PERSON	in words which leave nothing unsaid . '

		* We would have this series put artistic craftsmanship before people as furnishing : reasonable occupation for thos & • who would gain a liTelihood .

		Although within the bounds of academic art , the competition , of its kind , is so acute that only a few per cent can fairly hope to succeed a '' painters and sculptors ; yet , as artistic craftsmen , there is every probability that nearly every one who would pass through a sufl & cient period of apprenticeship to workmanship and design would reach a measure of success . ''

		There are some excellent observations on the part which design should play in all good workmanship , it being the intention of the series to insist upon both as equally essential to the best results ; but the crux of the matter is in the concluding sentence of the paragraph quoted .

		Mr.
Cockerell	PERSON	, on his part , ^ is explicit in describing , minutely and accurately , all the various processes which are used in bringing into existence a worthily bound book .

		He makes a nice distinction , which can be commended , be - tween '' binding '' a book , meaning the envelopment of its back and sides in some permanent material , and `` casing '' a book , signifying its enclosure in boards covered with paper or cloth , for commercial purposes .

		With the latter procedure he is con - cerned no further than to point out the essential differences between the two ; but he makes it clear at all times that modern bindings are in some instances without any element of permanency , and modern casings almost invariably so , -- even to the extent of requiring the librarian to rebind his entire collection every few years .

		Mr.
Cockerell	PERSON	's volume , describing as it does every process and tool con - nected with bookbinding , and containing much sensible advice on the care and preservation of books , is one that the librarian should not do with - out .

		To the series of '' Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- we have the addition of a vol - ume on
Francia	LOCATION	, by Dr.
George C. Williamson	PERSON	, and one on
Brunelleschi	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Leader Scott	PERSON	.

		The volume on Francia contains considerable new matter unearthed quite recently by the author through Painter * and builders of the Renaissance ,

		THE DIAL .

		91 careful personal work in
Bologna	LOCATION	, where the artist was born and spent most of his life .

		Here he estab - lished a school of artists , numbering some two hun - dred students ; but notwithstanding this , and that he impressed his own ideas very firmly upon his pupils , his influence appears to have extended little beyond his immediate surroundings .

		His pictures betray no special sympathy with the classic or hu - manistic movement of his time .

		Perchance he was then looked upon as somewhat old-fashioned and out-of-date ; while now that his works are becoming better known , and some pictures that have been heretofore attributed to
Kaphael	PERSON	or Perugino are now placed to his credit without fear of dispute , he stands among the choice spirits at the close of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		-- The biographer of
Brunel	LOCATION	- leschi has to deal with a man of entirely different type , a man who made his impression both at once and for all time on the worlds of art and science .

		He found architecture languishing and rapidly tending to become a mere mechanical art ; it was collective rather than individual in its efforts .

		De - scriptions of the earlier Roman and Tuscan build - ings record the name of the patron or ruling operaio , but very seldom the name of the designer .

		After
Brunelleschi	PERSON	's grand strike for freedom , artists dared to stand alone , and the builders of the Renaissance shine out as separate men whose distinctive minds are impressed on their buildings , --
Alberti	PERSON	,
San Gallo	LOCATION	,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, and the rest .

		The first to apply the classic bias to architecture ,
Brunelleschi	ORGANIZATION	carried it out on the purest possible lines ; that Italian Renaissance architecture is less noble than it might have been , is largely because later builders departed from his lead .

		The illustrations , mainly made from photographs , are a notable and delightful feature of both of these volumes .

		The beginningt of American lUerature .

		The set of three neat volumes en - titled '' Colonial Prose and Poetry '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , prepared by Messrs.
W. P. Trent	PERSON	and
B. W. Wells	PERSON	, represents a happy thought on the part of both publishers and editors .

		We hasten to add that both have done their best in giving concrete expression to the thought , and that the resulting work is both outwardly delightful and intellectually stimulating .

		To those who are doubtful of the intellectual stimulus to be got from
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	and
Michael Wigglesworth	PERSON	, we can say only that our colonial writers have abundant interest for those who are willing to look for it .

		Viewed from the narrow standpoint of sesthetics , they have little to offer ; but seen in the wider vision that broadens before the student of social history and the spiritual life , they occupy a large place in our annals . ''

		Many who have gone to them with a smile have remained to be edified , '' say the editors ; `` in the earlier period men lived earnestly if not largely , they thought highly if not broadly , they felt nobly if not always with magnanimity . ''

		About fifty names are represented in this collection , besides such impersonal subjects as '' The Bay Psalm Book , '' Dutch life in town and country / . ''

		The New England Primer , '' and
Bacon	PERSON	's Rebel - lion .


John Smith	PERSON	,
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, and
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	are the three worthies whose portraits rightfully preface the several volumes .

		The titles of these volumes indicate their range .

		The first is '' The Transplanting of Culture , '' with such writers as
Bradford	PERSON	,
Winthrop	LOCATION	,
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	,
Williams	ORGANIZATION	,
Hooker	PERSON	, and
Anne Bradstreet	PERSON	.

		The second is `` The Begin - ning of Americanism , '' with such writers as
John	PERSON	- son ,
Eliot	LOCATION	,
Wigglesworth	PERSON	,
Penn	LOCATION	,
Sewall	PERSON	, and the
Mathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The third is '' The Growth of
National Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, '' with such writers as Prince ,
Edwards	PERSON	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and
Hutchinson	PERSON	.

		Each volume has an editorial preface , and each author represented has a biographical note .

		The entire work is so well contrived that it places us under a large debt of gratitude .

		Nothing of the sort has heretofore been accessible to the general reader , unless , perchance , he happened to own a
Duyckinck	LOCATION	, or had the vol - umes of the
Stedman	PERSON	and
Hutchinson	PERSON	'' Library '' on his shelves .

		But he can put these books in his pocket .

		One of the desirable results of the political situation of recent years is to make the American more than ever interested in what his fellow-citizens of the world -- the citizens of other nations -- think and do and feel .

		Our remoteness from most of the world-powers is apt to strengthen our indifference in this respect , and to induce in the popular mind a contempt for the foreigner that is not easily dis - guised .

		The series of volumes called '' Our
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean Neighbours '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is to be commended as a worthy undertaking which will do much to counteract this undesirable tendency .

		The vol - ume on '' Dutch Life in Town and Country '' comes from the pen of Mr.
P. M. Hough	PERSON	, who has long been a resident of
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	, and has made good use of his opportunities .

		There is much of interest in the present-day life of this thrifty and sturdy people .

		From the country folk to the
University	ORGANIZATION	professors , from the merchant to the professional classes , from laborer to courtier , the Dutch have developed a national life of their own , not to be confused with that of their neighbors .

		Their inde - pendence of spirit is a heritage that still is active in shaping their life in town and country .

		They form a nation well worth knowing ; and Mr.
Hough	PERSON	's volume offers the most convenient and interesting way of becoming acquainted with them , accessible to English readers .

		It is a sympathetic yet critical , a discerning and comprehensive account of life in modern
Holland	LOCATION	.

		More revolutionary ptyehology .

		There is a well-recognized literary disease which may be called logo - mania , and which subjects its victim to the irrational influence of words .

		The intoxica - tion at times becomes complete , and the victim reels under the dominance of the poison , though main - taining a semblance of coherence and occasionally of wisdom .

		The author -LRB- Mr.
J. W. Thomas	PERSON	-RRB- of 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, '' Intuitive Suggestion : A New Theory of the
Evo	PERSON	- lution of Mind '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- offers an obvious though not an extreme case of this unfortunate malady . ''

		Intuitive suggestion '' is to him the key that unlocks all mystery .

		This means that tha author of this book , after asking any of the fundamental - questions relating to the constitution of the universe and of life , receives a satisfactory thrill when pro- nouncing the words '' intuitive suggestion . ''

		He tells us that water must know intuitively when 32 ° Fahrenheit is reached in order that ice shall be formed ; that the magnet has an intuitive feeling for the north pole ; that the soaring of birds is far better explained by referring it to an intuitive knowl - edge of the laws of motion than to mechanical and physiological principles ; that the chemical elements have an intuitive seeking for their aflBnities ; and even that the land leeches of
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	do not smell `` but intuitively know the approach of their prey .

		That we are also taught that telepathy will in the future be the normal mode of communication ; that , indeed , psychic force will outdo wireless telegraphy , and that suggestion will destroy noxious weeds and vermin , -- all this seems of a piece with the theory of '' intuitive suggestion . ''

		Such a volume is the inevitable result of the attempt to reason without the natural or acquired ability to distinguish between true explanations and those that merely counterfeit ihe explanatory process .

		That most delightful form of literary fMra ^ ! ''

		^ '' C -LRB- ^ ^ erie which Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	contrives to write with so much dis - tinction is found nowhere in better exemplification than in his '' Gossip in a Library '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , now republished with additional matter , after enjoying a healthy and successful existence through half a score of years .

		Originally written at the suggestion of an American editor for Amer - ican readers , it has never lost the merit of an orig - inal method especially adapted to the hurried needs of American general culture .

		Its readers will recall that in substance it contains the briefest little discourses on books of all sorts and conditions , addressed by a collector of rare volumes to other collectors -- or , at least , to those in sympathy with his aims .

		The original preface is rightly retained , with its wondering protest against the imposition , by a nation calling itself civilized , of an import duty on books worth having ; an imposition the more marked , had Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	chosen to speak of it , for permitting books in languages other than English to come in duty free .

		A new preface for this edition has been added , suflBciently brief and informing to deserve quotation in full .

		Says the essayist : `` It is with a great deal of pleasure that I learn that the passion for rare books still flourishes in
America	LOCATION	, and that a new edition of this little book is called for .

		In order to give it a certain character of freshness , I have added , for
America	LOCATION	only , an essay on a volume which grows steadily , and almost year by year , in value and interest .

		Perhaps the bibliograph - ical data which I have given may prevent some ardent bib - liophile from adding to his library an incomplete copy of
White	ORGANIZATION	's '
Selborne	LOCATION	, ' a book which is particularly often offered in a mutilated or ' faked ' condition . ''

		This describes the difference between the former and the latter edition of '' Gossip in a Library '' with sufficient particularity , and it is pleasant to realize that no further changes have been made .

		The book is to be commended to all who love ele - gance and scholarship .

		Etsayi in
Philosophy	LOCATION	, Professor
Howison	PERSON	has placed not only the special student of philos - ophy , but the general reader as well , under obligation to him for his essays on `` The Limits of Evolution '' and other subjects -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- Ian -RRB- .

		Not that the treatment of these themes is popular , -- on the contrary , it is strictly philosophic ; but Professor
Howison	PERSON	possesses the enthusiam and mastery of style which are ordinarily absent from works of this kind .

		The purpose of the book , as stated by the author , is to illustrate `` the metaphysical theory '' which he calls '' Personal Idealism . ''

		This theory he seeks to present '' in its bearings on all the chief human concerns , -- on knowledge , joy , and devotion ; on Science , Art , and Religion . ''

		The paper which gives title to the book subjects the current doctrine of Evolution to a searching crit - icism which that doctrine preeminently calls for , and yet from which it in a measure revolts .

		It may yet present itself in its finality , not as an all - embracing theory of life and thought , but as having well-defined limits within which it is useful and valid .

		We can call special attention to the essay on the '' Art - Principle as Represented in Poetry . ''

		This discussion of the significance of art , and the place of poetry in the order of the fine arts , will be found timely and instructive .

		The paper on '' Human Immortality '' places that qucBstio vexata in a new and surprising light , and gives to the hope which mankind seems incapable of relinquishing a form that fortifies it against many of the serious assaults that are made upon it .

		The reader will find these papers everywhere stimulating and elevating ; and whatever his views may be upon the final questions dividing philosophers and mankind at large , he will gain from these discussions new insights , new points of view , and helpful illuminations .

J. H. Slater	PERSON	, is at hand , and covers the English auction season from

		The English auction season of 1900-01 was unusually successful , the total amount realised on the 38,377 lots sold being something over
$ 650,000	MONEY	.

		The average price per lot , about
$ 17.	MONEY	, is the highest on record .

		Oddly enough , one of the factors that Mr.
Slater	PERSON	mentions as having to do with the general rise in the price of old books is the advent of the new century , `` which , in imagination , has suddenly aged them by a huadred years . ''

Walter Lowrie	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, has not contented himself with ab - stracting his material from the literature of the subject already in existence , but has given the re - sults of entirely independent researches into such subjects as the Christian Cemeteries , Christian Ar - chitecture , Pictorial and Minor Arts , and
Ecclesi	PERSON	- astical Dress , from the second to the
sixth century	DATE	of the Christian era .

		He has also , by reason of his having lately been a Fellow of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	, been able to anticipate the publication of some important works by recent explorers in these fields .

		His book is therefore a valuable contribution to a knowledge of Ecclesiastical antiquities , at a time when the pop - ular knowledge of that subject is undergoing revision by reason of the interesting facts being brought to light by the scientific investigations of men like
Wilpert	LOCATION	,
Marucchi	LOCATION	, De Fleury , Le Blant ,
Ficker Holtzinger	ORGANIZATION	,
Venturi	PERSON	, Professor
Ramsey	PERSON	, and others .

		As an introduction to the subject of which it treats , the book is invaluable , especially in view of the ex - haustive '' Select Bibliography '' which it furnishes .

		It is evident that the author exercised great self - restraint in keeping his treatment of the subject within the proportions of a handbook .

		In '' A Short History of the Missis - ^ '' ^ ^ - ^ ir ^ '' -LCB- sippi Valley '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	has endeavored , in a small volume of a little over two hundred pages , to cover a vast range of both time and space .

		The book is very readable , both from the interest of the subject-matter and from the manner in which the interesting story is told ; yet only a few points are selected from a great number that demand atten - tion .

		Fifty pages are given to the Indians and the French ; another fifty to the early pioneers and the Revolution ; a third fifty carries the story on from the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	to
Jackson	PERSON	's victory at
New Orleans	LOCATION	; fifty are devoted to the Civil War ; and a brief chapter treats of the region at the close of the century .

		This outline will show the inadequacy of the book as a history of the region between the AUeghanies and the Rockies ; but certain aspects of the history are admirably treated , and some lit -

		The book will be useful in a way , though one might wish that so skilful a writer had more fully covered the ground appropriated by his title .

		The life of
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	in the series of '' Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been written by Mr.
James Sehouler	PERSON	, whose work as historian showed him to be in sympathy with Jef - ferson , rather than with
Hamilton	PERSON	, in the party conflicts that attended the establishment of our gov - ernment .

		But this lack of partisan sympathy results in giving us a truer estimate of
Hamilton	LOCATION	than we can get from one who is blinded by the genius of the brilliant statesman , and few writers of more aristocratic principles have escaped this fascination .

		There is little of narrative in the book ; the author devotes himself to the higher task of discussion , explanation , and judgment .

		He gives due praise for the fruitful labors of
Hamilton	LOCATION	in bringing about the adoption of the Constitution and in establishing the finances of the new nation .

		But he also sets forth clearly
Hamilton	PERSON	's defects of temperament and opinion , his restless egotism , his aristocratic contempt for the common people , and his lack of ability as a political leader that nearly thwarted his wise plans and did wreck his party .

		The collection is a very com - plete and well-chosen one , giving , first , extracts from the '' Egyptian Book of the Dead , '' following with selections from

		In the conclusion of the introductory essay , Mr.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The eight volumes of '' Social England , '' edited by the late
H. D. Traill	PERSON	, are to be reissued in six much larger volumes , revised under the editorship of Mr ,
J. S. Mann	PERSON	, and copiously illustrated in the instructive manner made familiar to us by the illustrated edition of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History . ''

		The first volume of the new edition has already appeared from the press of the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, the American publishers , and makes us eager to see the others .

		The text of this work , as our readers know , is a sort of mosaic of chapters or paragraphs by eminent specialists ; much of this matter has been revised for the new edition .

		The illustrations of this one volume are literally hundreds in number , and the list of them alone , with a few brief notes , fills over thirty large pages of the work .

		The lover of Thoreau wishes , above all else , light on the personality of the man ; but we can not say that Mr.
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	in '' The Personality of Thoreau '' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	:
Charles E. Goodspeed	PERSON	-RRB- is very illuminating .

		The sketch is extremely brief , and is mostly concerned with external characteristics and details , -- as in ac - counts of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's house , relatives , and friends .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's remarks on
Thoreau	PERSON	's imitation of
Emerson	LOCATION	are of interest .

		He sees great similarity , for in - stance , in the penmanship of the two , which can scarcely be discriminated , but he regards the imita - tion as wholly unconscious .

		Some light is thrown on the works of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, particularly the Journals , and on his life ; but we have not the personal study we might expect from one who knew
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	so intimately .

		The volume , produced at the
Merrymount Press	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	, is a fine example of the printer 's art .

		The fac - simile reproductions of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's handwriting , and the beautiful photogravure illustration , lend it an addi - tional attractiveness .

		The
Detroit	LOCATION	meeting of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	was the fortieth annual gathering of our chief American organization of teachers .

		The '' Journal '' of the meeting has now made its appearance , and comes to us , as usual , from Mr.

the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The proceedings of the
Chicago	LOCATION	meeting of the
Department of Superintendence	ORGANIZATION	, held in

		``
Mary Rich	PERSON	, Countess of
Warwick	LOCATION	, 1625-1678 , '' by Miss
Mary E. Palgrave	PERSON	, is a new volume in the series of '' Saintly Lives , '' edited by Mr.
R. F. Horton	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three more volumes of the • ' Temple Bible '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- have appeared .

		Exodus is edited by Dr.
A. R. S. Kennedy	PERSON	,

		The Bibliographer , '' a monthly magazine devoted to bibliography and rare book news , is soon to make its appearance , under the editorship of Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers . ''

		Tales of Past Times '' is a volume of '' Temple Clas - sics for
Young People	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tales are no other than those of
Perrault	LOCATION	, with '' Beauty and the Beast '' added because it belongs there .

		`` Four American Inventors , '' by Miss
Frances M. Perry	PERSON	, is a book for young readers just published by the
Werner School Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fulton ,
Whitney	LOCATION	,
Morse	PERSON	, and Mr.

		The work on '' Chinese Porcelain '' completed by the late
Cosmo Monkhouse	ORGANIZATION	just before his death , will be issued in this country by the
A. Wessels Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume will contain numerous colored plates and other illustrations .

		To the series of `` Modern Plays , '' of which the
Charles H. Sergei Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers , there has just been added a volume which contains '' The Revolt '' and `` The Escape '' of Villiers de I ` lsle
Adam	PERSON	, both translated by Miss
Theresa Barclay	PERSON	.

		A reprint of
Boker	ORGANIZATION	's tragedy of ''
Francesca	PERSON	da
Rimini	LOCATION	'' is sent us by the
Dramatic Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It is a good-looking volume , and will doubt - less secure readers on account of the recent successful revival for acting purposes of this sterling tragedy .

		The Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	are publishing a new popular edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	, with the original illustrations , and '' The Newcomes '' is the first volume to be issued .

		The use of thin paper brings the upwards of eight hundred pages into a volume that is not overswollen .

		Messrs.
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a translation of '' The King 's Ring , '' by
Zachris Topelius	PERSON	.

		This is all very well , but the publishers are greatly mistaken in supposing that they are publishing Topelius for the first time in
America	LOCATION	.

		Not only '' The King 's Ring , '' but the entire series of '' The Surgeon 's Stories '' to which it belongs , has been before our public in an ad -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 mirable translation for upwards of fifteen years , having been produced by the enterprise of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and made widely familiar to English readers .


John Richard Green	PERSON	's '' Oxford Studies , '' edited by Mrs.
Green	PERSON	and
Miss Norgate	PERSON	, is a new '' Eversley '' volume published by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		To the same always attractive series the two volumes of Pro- fessor
Clifford	PERSON	's `` Lectures and Essays '' have also been added .

		In connection with the
New Sydenham Society	ORGANIZATION	, Messrs.
P. Blakiston	PERSON	's
Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce the publi - cation of '' An Atlas of Clinical Medicine , Surgery , and Pathology , '' selected and arranged with the design to afford , in as complete a manner as possible , aids to diagnosis in all departments of practice .

		A timely volume on
Nicaragua	LOCATION	will be published at an early date by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the title '' Ocean to Ocean . ''

		It is written by
Lieuten	PERSON	- ant
James G. Walker	PERSON	,
U. S. N.	PERSON	, a son of Rear Admiral
Walker	PERSON	who was in charge of the
Nicaragua	LOCATION	Survey of
1898	DATE	.

		At the same time Messrs.
McClurg	PERSON	will also issue a new edition of Mr.
Henry I. Sheldon	PERSON	's '' Notes on the
Nicaragua	LOCATION	Canal , '' uniform in style with Lieu - tenant
Walker	PERSON	's book . ''

		The Land of Sunshine , '' under its new name of * ' Out West , '' continues to be what it has been hitherto , only '' more so . ''

		Dominated by the vigorous person - ality of its editor , Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, it preaches with no uncertain sound the doctrine of national righteousness .

		Its belief in the West as the only sec - tion of the country in which sound minds in sound bodies are possible is insisted upon with possibly too much of strenuousness ; but the fierce diatribes of the • editor against the crowded and effete East are to be taken as humorous affectations rather than as serious propositions .

		In its new form , the magazine is more profusely illustrated than ever .

		A fine poem by Miss
Sharlot M. Hall	PERSON	emphasizes the new departure taken by Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	and his associates .

		We spoke the other day of the late
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	as having constituted a link between our own age and the past .

		Our age has been linked to a still remoter past by the poet whose death must now be chronicled .

		Aubrey De Vere was born in
1814	DATE	, and became a name in English poetry sixty years ago .

		Since then , upwards of a score of volumes in verse and prose have borne that name , and won for their writer an honorable place among English men of letters .

		A Wordsworthian in spirit , having also some affinities with
Shelley	PERSON	, his poetry will richly repay examination .

		Fortunately , we have the volume of selections which Mr.
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	made eight years ago , represent - ing the poet 's work in its variety and at its best .

		We particularly recommend this book together with its sympathetic critical introduction .

		Aubrey De Vere 's volume of personal '' Recollections '' will be remembered by many readers .

		Among many titles , the following may be named : `` The Search after Proserpine , '' `` The Legends of St.
Patrick	PERSON	, '' `` Alexander the Great , '' '' Antar and
Zara	PERSON	, '' '' St.
Thomas	PERSON	of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' The Foray of Queen
Meave	PERSON	. ''

		Just before the last number of The Dial was issued , but too late for mention upon that occasion , came the news of the death of
Horace Elisha Seudder	PERSON	, at his home in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Even at this late hour we must find a few words to say of a man who played an im - portant part in the later development of American literature , and whose intellectual and moral qualities were of the finest type .

		Aside from the writing of his early books for children , Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	's work was done so unobtrusively that his name was not familiar to a very large public .

		To be the editor of the '' Atlantic Monthly , '' as Mr.
Seudder	PERSON	was for a number of years , is not to be conspicuously in the public eye , but to those who know how to recognize real values , it is rather more of a distinction than to be President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Many a piece of Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	's best work went into the magazine , and escaped recognition ; many another piece of that work took the shape of editorial matter done for some book or new edition published by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and few were the readers who knew to whom they were indebted .

		For - tunately for his fame Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	's last years brought him the opportunity of doing one important piece of literary work on a large scale and in his own name .

		We refer , of course , to the biography of his old friend and neighbor ,
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	.

		The more we recur to this biography the more are we impressed with its judicious use of materials and its constructive excellence .

		For the sake of his literary memory , we are glad that Mr.
Seudder	PERSON	has left us this magnum opus .

		His personal memory needs no such aid , as far as those who were privileged to know him are concerned .

		It is the memory of a scholar and a gentleman , of a clear intelligence and an engaging character .

		Rarely has the educational world experienced such a thrill as was aroused by the announce - ment of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's offer to the nation of
ten million dollars	MONEY	for the establishment of an institution to encourage research and the cause of learning .

		As the terms of the endowment , the special purposes of the foundation , the se - lection of the trustees , the choice of Dr. Oilman for the presidency of the institution , success - ively became known , the thrill of expectancy became a happy assurance that the tidings were joyous indeed .

		There is so much aimless and undiscerning discussion in regard to educational ends and needs and values and methods -- and much of it unfortunately emanating from high places and influential voices -- that it is but natural that , more than occasionally , men of wealth with benevolent intentions become distracted amid the clamor of hungry mouths , and in the end yet another instance of misdirected phil - anthropy is added to a long list .

		One is often tempted , under the inspiration or the irritation of so much misguided effort and weakly in - vested capital , to favor the appointment of a national Director of Philanthropy , and give him dictatorial power to shower philanthropic millions where the consensus of informed judgment believed it to be most potential of future benefits .

		Yet in the light of recent benefactions it would be both unjust and un - kind to repeat the pessimistic dictum that the only good sort of a benefactor is a dead one ; far better is the live one who is wise enough to invite the cooperation of experienced and scholarly men , and to entrust to such men , without hampering restrictions or narrowing conditions , the supreme task of breathing the breath of life into the body corporate which the munificent gift supplies .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has erected a supremely worthy monument and inscribed it '' To the man who knows ! ''

		Such conspicuous recognition of learning as an expert art of national consequence is most exhilar - ating , -- especially in contrast to the more general distrust of learning and the thinly - veiled condescension toward its professors , which a common worship at the shrine of ma - terial success has made prevalent . ''

		In the broadest and most liberal manner 110 THE DIAIi -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, to encourage investigation , research , and dis - covery , to show the application of knowledge to the improvement of mankind '' ; '' to increase the efficiency of the Universities ... by aid - ing teachers in the various institutions in ex - perimental and other work '' ; '' to discover the exceptional man in every department of study , whenever and wherever found , and enable him by financial aid to make the work for which he seems specially designed his life work '' ; '' to secure , if possible , for the
United States of America	ORGANIZATION	leadership in the domain of discovery and the utilization of new forces for the benefit of man '' ; -- such are the expressed purposes of the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	endowment .

		That they will be both liberally and wisely interpreted , and likewise vigorously administered , is assured by the fortunate selection of the directive head of the institution .

		As president of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, Dr. Oilman has exhibited two qualities which are most needed for success in educational pioneering .

		He showed his ability to discover the real significance and the real weakness of an educational situation , and steadfastly to adhere with singleness of purpose to the chosen goal of his activity ; he recog - nized more fully than any other at the time the necessity for graduate study in the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can
University	ORGANIZATION	and the practical possibilities of its development .

		And he showed himself peculiarly successful in selecting at a compar - atively early stage of their development the men of promise who were to be the leaders of their craft in the near future .

		Unlike the mother in the play who dismissed the promis - ing young men who presented themselves as suitors for her daughter 's hand in a vain search for a man who had his future behind him , Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	appreciated the stimulus to achievement that comes of timely recognition , and the assumption of high responsibilities .

		He was willing to follow
Mark Twain	PERSON	's philo - sophic advice to '' put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket . ''

		Even more fundamental was the recognition thus accorded to the vital , though not self-evident , truth that men of outwardly equal rank are born and develop with conspicuous inequality .

		To dis - cover the exceptional man and to provide him with the environment suitable to the richest fruitage of his talents , constitutes an invest - ment of material and intellectual resources of the very highest possible value , whether meas - ured by the practical benefits inevitably to flow therefrom , by the reflex stimulation of learning which it is certain to encourage , or by the widespread prestige and appreciation of suc - cessful intellectual endeavor which it is likely to disseminate .

		Without assuming the uncertain role of the prophet , one may recognize in the
Carnegie	LOCATION	foundation a powerful instrument for the ad - vancement of learning , and one may anticipate eminent success from the wise determination of the makers of this instrument to focus it upon a specific field of influence .

		Such a policy is far better than the duplication of existing resources at the national capital -LRB- with its al - most inevitable entanglement with political aspirations -RRB- , which the well-meaning enthus - iasts for a national
University	ORGANIZATION	had been so loudly advocating .

		We may interpret Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's assurance that '' were
Washington	LOCATION	still with us , his finely balanced judgment would decide that , in our generation at least , such use of wealth would not be the best '' as a patriotic tribute to the father of his country ; yet it testifies as well to the wise dominance of pro- gressive educational principles in the framing of the institution that is to be .

		True is it that the plan is an innovation and carries with it the element of venture incident to untried ex - periments ; yet '' he that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils , for time is the greatest innovator . ''

		What we demand of in - , novation is that it shall be born of ripe judg - ment and bear promise of conformity with the natural trend of evolution .

		An Englishman , himself a Conservative , defined Conservatism as the unwillingness to adopt a newer way of doing things until it was shown to be a better way .

		Under that dictum we should all be Con - servatives , no doubt ; yet we should continue to differ as to the kind of evidence necessary to produce such conviction ; and an unreason - able and over-cautious disinclination to venture a hazard of new fortunes will ever be charac - teristic of some sorts of men .

		Conservatism in education has been a peculiarly hampering -- though not rarely also a saving -- influence ; and this , because convention , crystallized tra - dition , and worship of the status quo -LRB- to say nothing of the indolent comfort of a policy of laissez Jaire -RRB- ^ have been such constant and potent factors in the history of educational reforms .

		Latterly , our transgressions have changed somewhat in character .

		We are doubt - less as ready as is good for us to try new methods , to establish new curricula , to discard ancient traditions , to bow down before new theories and proclaim , not a royal , but a demo - cratically short-cut road to learning .

		Yet to a
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 111 discerning and disinterested observer the edu - cational hives of industry where these products are put together , would seem more like great repair shops than smoothly-working and well - ordered factories .

		We putter and fuss and talk glibly of growth and improvement , while the really vital problems receive neither dis - cussion nor any other helpful form of attention .

		It is at such a time , when the few are striving with strained vision to foresee and direct the next stages in educational unfoldment , that the innovator provided with material means and intellectual resources finds his opportunity .

		The expressed purpose of the Carnegie founda - tion '' to promote original research , paying great attention thereto , as being one of the chief purposes of the institution , '' indicates a serious attempt to remedy one of the great deficiencies of our academic organization , and to make the devotion to research as a life - occupation as well established and as worthy in dignity , attainments , and reputation as the highest positions devoted to the dissemination of learning by teaching .

		The lack of a proper income , the lack of leisure , the lack of inducements toward the investigative career , the lack of a congenial at - mosphere to nurture such devotion to research as survives among the professorial and allied classes , -- these are of a nature all compact ; and together constitute one of the most serious adversities incident to the academic life in
America	LOCATION	.

		A partial alleviation of any one of these is certain to prove a partial alleviation of all ; and it is because the founders of the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	institution have recognized in these needs a fundamental weakness of the present educational outlook , and because they foresee the great practical opportunity to administer to these needs , that the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	foundation must be set down as an event of extraordinary consequence .

		This pronounced defect in Amer - ican Universities has naturally not escaped notice .

		It is most forcibly and discerningly set forth in Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's arraign - ment of the dearth of productive scholarship in this country -LRB- ''
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, ''
June	DATE	,
1901	DATE	-RRB- ; and his keen diagnosis of the cause of the malady is as wholesome reading as is his prescription of the remedy that is to be applied , along with the directions for its application .

		In the ordinary course of events public sentiment upon this topic would have had to be well shaken before the remedy would have been taken .

		The fortunate appearance of Mr. Car - negie 's devotion will act as a stimulus that will at once place the case upon a more hopeful footing .

		It is not well to chill the optimism of the friends of the investigative career , or to restrain the joyous belief of underpaid and overburdened professors that there is a good time coming ; yet it is well to remind ourselves of the slow growth and careful nurture that such ideals require .

		Not to all who wearily climb the hill to see from afar the pleasing prospect , will it be granted to enter in and possess the promised land .

		Yet the influence of this message of good will to productive au - thorship is sure to penetrate far and wide .

		Likewise is it worthy of note that the in - vestigative career , and doubtless the mission of the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	institution , embraces a far wider scope than the application of scientific princi - ples to practical arts and inventions .

		Investi - gations likely to reach the self-supporting stage without too long or costly an infancy are the ones least needful of philanthropic protection .

		When pecuniary profit seems likely , the neces - sary '' angel '' to safeguard the auspicious vent - ure is usually , though not always , to be found .

		Far more typical of the career which requires fostering care and helpful stimulus is that of the scholar in any one of the sciences or hu - manities , at present laboring with inadequate means and amid distracting obligations , to penetrate a step farther into some unexplored recess of nature 's
Africa	LOCATION	, to interpret the sig - nificance of social and political tendencies , to restate for present-day needs some chapter of the story of human evolution , or some pertinent aspect of the forces that make for culture and civilization . ''

		To discover the exceptional man in every department of study , whenever and wherever found '' suggests a pleasingly liberal interpretation of the purposes and the scope of the investigative career , and gives promise of a broad as well as a profound de - votion to the cause of productive scholarship .

		And it does more than this : for it recognizes that creative industry demands its own condi - tions and will not respond to arbitrary demands nor imposed conventions .

		The Muse is coy and the Sphinx is dumb ; and success is to wit as well as to valor .

		It is difficult enough under most favorable circumstances to direct intel - lectual energy into the most profitable channels .

		If we but knew where lies
El Dorado	LOCATION	surely there would be no lack of philanthropic enter - prise to equip expeditions for such tempting rewards .

		But as things are , the least and the most we can do , is to provide that some future
Columbus	LOCATION	need not go begging from court to 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, court for a few ships to start him upon his voyage of discovery , nor have to encounter the growing dissatisfaction and the threatened mu - tiny of his crew because the shores of the new world are not soon enough in sight .

		Yet last as first , the success of such projects as that inaugurated by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	depends upon the individuality of the men who are to direct its fortunes .

		It is men that make a
University	ORGANIZATION	and differentiate one academic milieu from another ; and next to them , or , bet - ter , because of them , the intellectual atmosphere in which they live and move and pass on to others the lights that they have kept burning .

		The deepest cause for congratulation is that a gift so potent for good should have been so wisely given ; that with good intentions has been united good counsel .

		For '' the greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving counsel , for in other confidences men commit the parts of life -- their lands , their goods , their child , their credit , some particular affair ; but to such as they make their coun - sellors they commit the whole . ''

		PINEBO 'S LATEST DBAMA .

		Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	, the most conspicuous English dra - matist of the day , is a playwright who seeks to say something , and who says it with no small amount of dramatic technique .

		He succeeds thereby in having his utterance heard by an extremely large number of people , and in provoking a good deal of sober second thought .

		The casual first impressions of his latest drama have now had time to fade , and it may be worth while to put together the impres - sions aroused by several hearings of the play .

		The story of '' Iris '' must by this time be fa - miliar to all readers of current dramatic criticism .

		Briefly , it is the tragic downfall of a weak-willed , attractive woman to whom the luxuries of life are necessities , and the necessities -- love and honor -- are , one had almost said , luxuries .

		About this char - acter is woven an interesting and depressing plot , whose structure and doctrine I propose to discuss , by way of testing the reality of Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's art .

		Iris , a widow of twenty-six , will lose her fortune if she remarries .

		The suitors whose wealth would make this condition insignificant do not move her , and the one man who attracts her fancy is a pen - niless young fellow ,
Trenwith	PERSON	, a burden to his rela - tions , who have , as a final act of charity , found an opening for him in
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		He would willingly leave
England	LOCATION	but for his infatuation with
Iris	PERSON	, who lets him dance attendance on her , perhaps in the hope that through some acquaintance or other a good position may yet be found for him .

		Mar - riage is impossible unless conditions change materi - ally .

		Chief among
Iris	PERSON	's rejected suitors is Fred -
erick Maldonado	PERSON	, an immensely wealthy Jew of Spanish-American extraction , who , despite his re - jection , is at any moment at
Iris	ORGANIZATION	's call .

		Beside him , Trenwith is but a boy , physically and intel - lectually .

		These three characters are the protag - onists , and the dramatic problem is to develop out of the obviously unstable equilibrium of the initial situation a series of incidents that shall make out of Iris 's playing with her chances an inevitable ruin .

		This problem Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	handles with entire sin - cerity and outspokenness , and without vulgarity .

		He has thought out his subject , if not convincingly , at least in a way that is fair and above board .

		He has no desire to make vice attractive , any more than he has to disguise the consequences of sin .

		Indeed , he has given a striking proof of his sincerity in depriving himself of one of the playwright 's re - wards : he does not once let the curtain go down on a situation that tempts to spontaneous applause ; and this from a dramatist who , even in a disagree - able situation -LRB- witness the schne h faire in ' * Quex '' -RRB- , can keep an audience alert with sympathetic inter - est. .

		It is a sacrifice of the continuous effect of approval for the sake of the ultimate effect , as if Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	had said , '' I do not care how the play is received at any given moment , if I can have my audience go away in thought . ''

		That effect , at least , is secured .

		The play begins with
Iris	PERSON	's farewell dinner party before she goes to the Continent for the
summer	DATE	.

		Most of the first scene is purely expository : the guests tell each other what an attractive woman
Iris	PERSON	is , and the praises of '' our divinity '' are scat - tered lavishly through the first three acts .

		So far as the play is concerned .

		Iris does absolutely noth - ing to deserve the extravagant eulogies , for in words and actions she is not lovable , witty , or sensible ; we must take her on faith .

		It is remarkable that so '' modern '' a dramatist as Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	shonld revert to the undramatic , old-fashioned novelist 's trick of telling us how charming his heroine is , lest perchance we should not discover it from what she says and does .

		The initial situation is leisurely put before us .

		Iris 's friend and man of business ,
Archie	PERSON	-LRB- it is mostly first names in the play -- there are no outsiders -RRB- , finds occasion to tell
Iris	PERSON	that her friendship for
Trenwith	ORGANIZATION	is causing gossip , -- scandal .

		She is surprised and pained , but immediately other guests enter , and there is talk and more talk .

		As the scene closes , with the guests going down to din - ner .

		Iris holds
Maldonado	PERSON	back for a moment and promises to become his wife .

		The real action has now begun : Iris is to marry
Freddy Maldonado	PERSON	to put a stop to the scandalous and false reports .

		The curtain immediately goes up on the same scene ; dinner is over .

		This device of splitting up an act into episodes , marked by the dropping of the cur - tain merely to indicate the lapse of time , is several times effectively employed .

		The guests are about to go .

		Trenwith begs
Iris	PERSON	for a few minutes after
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 the rest have gone .

		She tells him that
Maldonado	PERSON	has asked for the same privilege ; Trenwith per - sists ; then she suddenly relents , and tells him to come after
Maldonado	PERSON	has gone .

		Alone with ''
Maldo	PERSON	, '' she repulses his caresses , and tells him fairly that she does not love him , and that she can only engage to be the mistress of his house , '' faith - fully and honorably . ''

		Maldonado hears her with indignant surprise , but impetuously declares that he will take his chance .

		The third episode of the act brings
Iris	PERSON	and Trenwith together .

		Thunder - struck at her engagement , the young fellow begs her to break it , to marry him and go out with him to the ranch .

		Iris is obdurate : she is '' not fit to be a poor man 's wife , '' she tells
Trenwith	PERSON	, speaking to him as frankly as she had spoken to
Maldo	LOCATION	.

		In a sudden passion of despair , Trenwith kisses her ; and as if carried away by her affection for the younger man .

		Iris writes a hasty word to
Maldo	LOCATION	, breaking the engagement , and cries to Trenwith , '' Follow me to
Switzerland	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus much , with somewhat inert movement , the first act has presented .

		Stated bluntly , the first phase of the problem is : given this woman , who is fond of comfort , and who is offered an honorable choice between love without luxury , and luxury where she does not love , she will seek to evade the choice , that she may have both of the things she desires , even at a frightful cost .

		The play has re - vealed this dramatic weakness , however :
Iris	PERSON	has pledged her word and then has broken it ; and in spite of all the dialogue , one does not fully know why she has done either .

		However obscure her reasons may be to her , to the spectator they should be absolutely lucid .

		Instead of using incident to interpret character , Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	has devoted his first act to describing character which is expected to in - terpret incident .

		The slow movement is then a structural weakness , and not a too full elaboration of a well-arranged scheme .

		The second act , six weeks later , is at
Lake Como	LOCATION	, whither not merely Trenwith , but
Fanny Sylvain	PERSON	and
Croker Harrington	PERSON	, have followed Iris .

		Fanny -LRB- an intimate friend of Iris -RRB- and
Croker	PERSON	-LRB- one of the several rejected suitors -RRB- are practically the Chorus of this un-Greek drama ; devoted to their heroine , they sing her praises in and out of season ; and in default of lyric odes , favor the spectators with epi - grams that are the only enlivening features of the play .

		The comparison to the Chorus is not entirely fanciful : Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	has cut down his real action to three figures , and
Iris	PERSON	's two devoted friends have as their main function only to pass comment on the drama of which they are spectators .

		This office is vividly performed in this act , after
Iris	PERSON	and Tren - with have had a dialogue alone together .

		Trenwith -LRB- who does not at any time in the play win the spec - tator 's sympathy -RRB- tries to make a stand : he has enough manhood in him to feel that the situation is becoming impossible -- his small remnant of money is disappearing , and the ranch is his only hope ;
Iris	PERSON	would have him take her money , and when he will not , she begs him to delay another month before they face the question of the future ; and
Trenwith	ORGANIZATION	agrees .

		A few minutes that
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	and
Croker	PERSON	then have together suffice to emphasize
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's dread of the gossip that is now on in full cry indeed .

		Fanny 's hesitating unwillingness to believe the worst , and
Croker	PERSON	's impasnioned appeal to believe only the best , come to the spectator , who knows that the worst is true , as the keenest of dramatic irony .

		This finely balanced scene closes at the re-entrance of
Iris	PERSON	and her lover .

		Suddenly , as the four friends are at dejeuner .

		Croker stumbles upon a newspaper paragraph that means financial ruin to them all : Archie has absconded , after losing all their money in speculation .

		Croker and Fanny are penniless , and
Iris	PERSON	, the luxurious , has left bat a hundred and fifty pounds a year .

		Upon this desolate group , just as the curtain drops , saunters
Maldonado	PERSON	, the mill - ionaire .

		This act has been simple and straight - forward in its development .

		The calamity is well led up to , and the characters speak without ambig - uity .

		The dramatist has now stated the second phase of the problem : a woman who has refused poverty with the man she loves , and luxury with the man she does not love , and has chosen the hazard - ous lot of unwedded love which preserves her lux - ury , is deprived of the independent wealth that alone made the doubtful position tenable for a while .

		What will she do now ?

		What she does , and what , moreover , she will do , the strong third act makes perfectly apparent .

		Like the first act , the third is in three episodes , each with its central incident , its controlling emotion , and each hurrying on the story , if not irresistibly , yet powerfully .

		First of all .

		Iris announces her engagement to
Trenwith	ORGANIZATION	.

		The marriage is not to take place at once , for
Trenwith	ORGANIZATION	is at last to go to
British Columbia	LOCATION	, and is to come back in two or three years .

		But as
Trenwith	ORGANIZATION	prepares to go , it is Maldonado who dominates the scene .

		His generous offers of aid have been refused by each one of Archie 's victims ; it only remains for them to part and try their luck as best they may .

		Wineglass in hand Mald < mado makes a long and fluwery speech , proposing
Trenwith	ORGANIZATION	's health and happy return to his loving and vivtvLoxis fianc6e .

		The sneer is well - concealed , but it immediately defines
Maldonado	PERSON	's position AS the disturbing element of the drama .

		The following episode contains the best and also one of the least satisfying moments in the play .

		The dawn breaks upon
Iris	PERSON	and Trenwith , who have put off the final parting until the last moment .

		Through sheer weariness .

		Iris has fallen asleep , and as the watching Trenwith awakens her , she starts up to the horror of the cold , rainy dawn , which sends all the courage out of her blood .

		Again Trenwith asks her to marry him and come with him , and again Iris refui ^ es , this time because she would prove to him that she can bear poverty alone and thereby be worthy to become his wife .

		Tren - with does not urge her -LRB- he is after all but a puppet in Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's hands -RRB- , and here of course at a 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, critical moment the play is structurally weak .

		The plot demands that
Iris	PERSON	and Trenwith shall be sep - arated , and the dramatist seems content with any reason instead of the one inevitable reason .

		A rea - son , indeed , he takes the trouble to provide , but he establishes no connection between it and what has gone before .

		This process of going back only one step , instead of creating a train of events , is now seen to be the explanation of the structural weak - ness of the first act .

		But this important objection waived , the rest of the scene under consideration is superb , and rises to a lofty moral tone instinct with dramatic quality as
Iris	PERSON	cries out to her lover , '' Remember me always , but forget more than you remember -- when you come back to me , come as to a stranger . ''

		The concluding episode of the act is quick and decisive .

		Maldonado offers to Iris a cheque-book , which she refuses to accept , but he leaves it , asking her to destroy it herself if she will not use it .

		The amount deposited to her credit '' is but a few hundreds -- or thousands . ''

		The first cheque is almost immediately drawn .

		Fanny 's niece , a young girl who has fluttered through the play just to be utilized in this scene , tells
Iris	PERSON	that
Miss Pinsent	PERSON	, who used to be
Iris	PERSON	's companion , has also been one of Archie 's victims .

		Iris 's quick sympathy brings the cheque-book into use .

		The step is taken ; when she leaves the house she takes the cheque-book with her ; and the spectator fore - sees the end .

		The third phase of the problem , now indeed hardly a problem , is phraseable thus :
Iris	PERSON	, who will risk scandal for the sake of the man she loves , is unable to brave the conditions of life that such love renders imperative ; accident will take her whither it will .

		In the fourth act ,
two years later	DATE	, the foreseen has happened .

		As
Maldonado	PERSON	's mistress .

		Iris is installed in luxury .

		In this act there is little move - ment , and much dialogue , pitiless and resentful , be - tween
Maldo	PERSON	and
Iris	PERSON	.

		Maldo offers her marriage , but
Iris	PERSON	scornfully puts off consideration of a step that could not rehabilitate her in her own self - esteem .

		Iris 's last remaining friend ,
Croker	PERSON	, enters , and
Maldo	PERSON	leaves them alone together .

		One does not often see on the stage more pathetic incidents than
Iris	PERSON	's eager , heart-broken listening to
Croker	PERSON	's account of
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's wedding and the people who were there -- `` I knew them all , I knew them all . ''

		Croker tells , too , of the return of Trenwith , ignor - ant of all that has happened , save that
Iris	PERSON	has ceased to write to him .

		The meeting that
Iris	PERSON	craves is arranged , after
Croker	PERSON	's final cry against his own degradation to a mere go-between -LRB-
Croker	ORGANIZATION	is by the way the best piece of character portrayal in the play -RRB- ; and
Maldo	PERSON	who , by a not too ingen - ious device of piecing the fragments of a torn letter , has discovered the plan , prepares to overhear the meeting .

		The fourth phase , then , is that the wo - man has found the futility of luxury and craves only her heart 's desire .

		In the moving fifth act ,
Iris	PERSON	tells Trenwith her whole story .

		For dramatic -- or rather theatrical -- purposes the dramatist has kept the spectator ig - norant of Iris 's downright suffering and abject poverty before she fell to
Maldonado	PERSON	.

		However effective the story is at this point , its previous sup - pression has had the effect of making us judge
Iris	PERSON	more sternly than if we had known the whole truth .

		This is dubious dramatic art , to sacrifice a sym - pathy and then try to regain it by an impassioned explanation .

		The grief-stricken recital does not win over the dazed Trenwith .

		To
Iris	PERSON	's cry , '' Take me back with you ! ''

		he can only reiterate , '' I am sorry ' -- extremely sorry , '' and leave the room slowly and with downcast head .

		Maldonado bursts in , and after a fiery denunciation of the woman , drives her out into the
night	TIME	.

		Then he impotently smashes some vases , the curtain falls , and the spectator is left to phrase for himself the solution of the prob - lem .

		One emerges on the dark and crowded streets , half expecting to see the deserted woman wandering aimlessly along .

		Perhaps this is Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's meaning ; we are given no other clue .

		One suddenly thinks of suicide as
Iris	PERSON	's alternative : will she accept it or enter the ranks of lost women ?

		In any event , the solution is tragic .

		When one attempts to find out precisely what the play means , he finds his way blocked by the dramatist 's apparent wavering between the conven - tional and the unconventional points of view .

		This prevents the play from declaring a clear moral principle .

		I do not use the term in its conventional sense , for morality is too large a thing ever to be conventionalized effectively .

		But I do not see that the play stands for any specific idea .

		Very obvi - ously Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	does not intend his play to be judged by conventional standards ; his
Iris	PERSON	is too poignant a presentation of character to be regarded as a type to be labelled and thus disposed of .

		The author means her pitiful case to be judged upon its individual merits ; and yet at the end , is it not the very height of conventional morality to take refuge in the banal conclusion of punishing the woman and letting her two partners in guilt go free ?

		To my mind , Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's remarkable play falls into the logical fallacy of insisting on the special case while having in reserve only the general verdict .

		If
Iris	PERSON	is by nature a vulgar courtesan , only withheld by circumstances from the inevitable end , then the conclusion is logical ; but every word of the first four acts pleads the reverse : if at any moment she might fall , so at any moment she might be redeemed .

		In reality ,
Iris	PERSON	's fall is more accidental than inevit - able .

		To urge that the end happens as it might happen in life is to waive the question ; for art has hardly the right to make the accidental seem rep - resentative .

		Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	uses his art to interpret
Iris	PERSON	's strange character , but when one expects the final word of interpretation , one hears only the blunt record .

		Thus the play leaves its hearers un - satisfied , but the disappointment is of a kind that an inferior play could not produce .

		THE DIAL 116 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		TESTS OP CULTURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Diau . -RRB-

		I have read Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's article , in your issue of
January 16	DATE	, on `` Recent American Poetry , '' in which he relates a story of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, who some - where speaks scornfully of the man who is not ashamed to be ignorant of the Eustachian tubes , but who would blush if caught saying `` Iphigdnia . ''

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	, com - menting , expresses his '' sympathy rather than scorn '' for such a man , adding : `` One can be well-educated without knowing anything of the Eustachian tubes , but ignorance concerning the pronunciation of `` Iphigenia ' betokens a defect of culture . ''

		I read this twice to make sure whether the writer were in earnest or only practising a little humorous aside upon us .

		If in
earnest	LOCATION	, then it seems to me his own test of culture is of the same ex parte order as that which he condemns in Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	.

		It is the literary man 's definition against the scientist 's .

		Similarly , some scholarly divine might tell us that one can be well - educated and know nothing about either the Eustachian tabes or the right penultimate accent in the word
Iphigenia	LOCATION	, but it is indispensable that one should know all about the spelling of Jahweh and the chapter and verse where the second writer in
Isaiah	LOCATION	begins .

		A socialistic writer and reformer would probably reject all three of these tests , and declare that that alone was true culture which included a perfect knowledge of the wage system and how to rescue the submerged tenth .

		The artist would tell us that whatever we did or did not know , we must , if we make any pretensions to cul - ture , understand the difference between a life-study and a drawing from the flat .

		The musician would say we must have a perfect comprehension of the intricacies of
Brahms	PERSON	and the harmonic subtleties of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		And so on !

		Each has his own definition of what we call culture , or of what constitutes an educated man ; but must we depend upon or be limited to any one of these judgments ?

		Is there not a definition , or at least an ideal , larger and truer ?

		Is culture to be measured by one 's proficiency in any single branch of human knowledge , gathered from books , the study , laboratory , or workshop ?

		Is it not rather to be defined in terms of life and human experience , as spiritual energy and power ?

		If this idea seems too wide and vague , cer - tainly the others mentioned fall far short of the real requirements .

		Emerson told us long ago that culture `` kills exag - geration , the conceit of our village or city . ''

		It also kills the conceit of our particular calling or point of view . ''

		Man 's culture can spare nothing , wants all the material . ''

		It begins '' in the organic effort of Nature to mount and meliorate , '' its end being '' to convert the Furies into Muses and the hells into benefit . ''

		All this without disparagement to Mr ,
Payne	PERSON	, whose literary reviews in The Dial are of great value to all who read , and one of its indispensable features .

		I am one of many who , in the rush of books from the modern press , am quite content he should do a large share of my reading for me , especially in the way of present - day fiction and poetry , where he is a recognized expert .

Baron Kanaguchi	PERSON	, Vice-Minister of the

		That he was compelled to resign was the gen - eral impression , which was strengthened by the following verses which he composed and published on retiring from office : `` Kako wa kamo , Mirai wa mizu ya Yuki-botoke .

		`` Sarabatote Oyeba nigura ya Fuyu no hai . ''

		This may be translated : '' The past a cloud , The future water Or a snow-image . ''

		Farewell then : Driven I flee , A

		ANOTHER PROTEST AGAINST `` PROVJJN . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A correspondent in a recent issue of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	is annoyed at the growing use of proven for proved .

		He says it is '' a distressing perversion '' and '' a silly affec - tation of an unreal archaism . ''

		This is serious ; and , worse still , our leading newspapers and magazines are `` every week , if not every day , '' saying proven .

		He very properly remarks that '' instruction will have but little effect if we are constantly to have before us such weighty examples to the contrary . ''

		Writers and speakers are too apt to imagine that they may make new words or modify old ones to suit their taste or convenience .

		They appear to consider words only as tools for aiding and expressing thought , and , like other tools , subject to change as convenience or fancy may dictate .

		In the fusion of the elements of our language the people seem to have helped themselves to French and
Saxon	PERSON	prefixes , suffixes , inflectional end - ings , and other loose word - material , to suit their needs and fancy , without strict regard at all times for the sanctity of pedigrees or grammatical rules .

		However , the laws of '' old English inflectional endings '' are greater than the people , and must be observed at all hazards .

		The dissyllabic form proven seems a little easier to say , and sounds a little more euphonious than proved with its '' V '' and '' d '' following each other without a relieving vowel sound between .

		Proven has , also , grown somewhat familiar to us in poetry , and in the Scots verdict '' Not proven . ''

		Perhaps , too , there is to the popular mind just a little more of homely strength , a little more proof , in proven .

		However , these slightly extenuating circumstances are far from excusing '' a silly affectation of an unreal archaism . ''

Russell	PERSON	would hardly seem to abate the keenness of this thrust .

		The qualities of mind that insure success at the bar are not brilliance , high cre - ative genius , or great originality ; they are rather common sense , clear-headedness , energy , indomitable perseverance , and self-control .

		These latter endowments the late Lord Chief Justice possessed in an eminent degree ; and to them he added the combativeness , quickness of repartee , and the fiery temper , together with the impulsive warm-heartedness , that charac - terize the true son of

		The fact that he visited this country on at least two occasions , that he delivered the address before the Amer - ican
Bar Association	ORGANIZATION	in

Charles Russell	PERSON	was born at
Newry	LOCATION	, County Down , in
1832	DATE	.

		He was fortunate in his par - entage : his father was neither rich nor poor , and was warmly attached to his children ; his mother was comely in person , energetic , clear - headed , and strong-willed , and something of a Spartan in domestic discipline .

		Before that he had held the office of Attorney-General , and had been made a Lord of Appeal .

		He was proud to declare himself the first Roman Cath - olic attorney-general , and the first Roman Catholic chief justice , since the Reformation ; and it is interesting to note that

		A premature death terminated his career , at the height of his usefulness and while his fame was still growing ,
August 10 , 1900	DATE	.

		His biography , by Mr.
R. Barry O'Brien	PERSON	, barrister - at - law , a fellow-countryman and co - religionist , is sympathetic and highly interest - ing .

		Devoted as it is almost exclusively to
Russell	PERSON	's professional activity , and written so soon after his death , it can not be pronounced the best possible or most authoritative and dis - passionate memoir of the man ; but its pages breathe his personality , and the narrative moves on with all the briskness and breeziness one could desire .

		Although he advocated home rule for Ire - land , and appeared as
Parnell	PERSON	's counsel before the
Parnell Commission	ORGANIZATION	, Lord
Russell	PERSON	never joined the Irish party , but remained a Liberal in politics .

		Yet no Irishman was ever more unflinchingly true to the land of his birth .

		A friend once said to him , ''
Russell	PERSON	, if you could only give up your Irish brogue , it would be worth to you at least another 500 pounds a year . '' ''

		I would not give it up , '' was the reply , '' for the additional 500 pounds . ''

		The activity that enabled him to crowd four days ' work into each twenty-four hours , is illustrated in the following : ''
Russell	PERSON	could not sit quietly in chambers .

		He had to do some practical thing .

		If he -LSB- was -RSB- not working , he was walking .

		The allurements of both the green table and the green turf were too much for

		His masterful , even over - bearing , way with judge and jury alike , is well shown by an anecdote first published by Mr.

O'Brien	PERSON	. ''

		In Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's young days in silk , when the late Mr.
Justice Denman	PERSON	was going the
Northern Circuit	ORGANIZATION	, just before the rising of the Court , on a warm
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	, some very high words were flung from the Bar to the Bench in a tone and in a vehemence which caused the learned judge to say that he would not trust himself to reprove them in his then condition of sorrow and resentment , but would take the night to consider what he ought to do , and when they met again the next morning he would announce his determination .

		In considerable commotion the
Court	ORGANIZATION	broke up , and on the following day it was crowded in anticipation of ' a scene , ' an anticipation somewhat encouraged by
Mr. Justice Denmau	ORGANIZATION	's entry into Court with if possible more than ordinary solemnity , and on taking his seat , commencing the business of the day by saying : `` Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, since the
Court	ORGANIZATION	adjourned last evening I have had the advantage of considering with my brother judge the painful incident ' ... Upon which
Russell	PERSON	quickly broke in with , ' My Lord , I beg you will not say a word more upon the subject ; for I can honestly assure you that I have entirely and for ever dismissed it from my memory ' -- a turning of the tables which provoked a roar of laughter in the Court that even the learned judge himself could not but join in . '' ''

		When
Russell	PERSON	is there , '' as was once well said of him , `` the judge is n't in it .

		Russell dominates every one . ''

		The intolerance he showed toward all stupidity , folly , verbosity , and affectation , was voiced in his abrupt ques - tion to a pretentious coxcomb : '' Have you read ' The Newcomes ' ? '' ''

		Yes , '' drawled the coxcomb . ''

		Well , you are very like
Barnes Newcome	PERSON	. ''

		But a kind heart underlay all this brusqueness .

		One of his '' devils '' tells a story of legal acumen on
Russell	PERSON	's part that almost amounted to inspiration .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	gives the incident in the narrator 's words . ''

		I had made a full note for him in a case .

		He did not read the brief himself .

		He spoke from the note .

		I sat behind him as he was addressing the jury .

		Sud - denly I remembered that I had omitted one most im - portant fact .

		I was horrified .

		I felt the cold perspi - ration running down my back .

		What was I to do ?

		If I interrupted him he would be angry , and if I let him close bis speech without niientioning this fact , he would be angry too .

		What was I to do ?

		It was not at all an easy thing to pull him up and go into this new mat - ter .

		There I sat still in doubt , while
Russell	PERSON	rattled along .

		Gradually he got to the point where this fact ought to come in , while I sat undecided , when suddenly , to my astonishment , out came in its proper place in the narrative the fact in question .

		I was amazed and re - lieved .

		How did he get it ?

		He had never opened the brief -- that I knew .

		As we walked away from Court I told him how sorry I was to have left out that fact , and what a funk I was in all the time he was speaking .

		He was not a bit angry .

		He took it very well .

		* But how , ' I asked , • did you know it ?

		You never read the brief ; you had nothing but the note . ' '

		Quite true , my boy , ' said he , • but I felt sure it must be so from the lie of the other facts . '

		The courage of the man , his faith in himself , amazed me .

		He felt assured from the general bearings of the case , without any special knowl - edge , that this particular thing had happened , and he said so with complete confidence . '' ''

		What is the punishment for bigamy ? ''

		was once asked him , according to report .

		`` Two mothers-in-law , '' was the ready reply .

		But his biographer , we regret to add , discredits this story .

		Se non e vero , e ben trovato .

		The last days of Lord
Russell	PERSON	's life were darkened for him by the lamentable course of events in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		His attitude as pre - siding judge at the trial of the
Jameson	PERSON	raiders -- it was his charge to the jury that procured their conviction -- foreshadowed his position with reference to the Boer War . ''

		What a terrible business this war is , '' he writes to Sir
Edward Frye	PERSON	, '' and what ignorance of the forces and difficulties to be met ! ''

		And again , in another letter to the same : '' What a sad business this war is !

		And what makes it worse in my mind is the fact that one does not feel assured we are wholly in the right , and that it might have been avoided . ''

		His high official station forbade him to express himself freely in this matter , and it was only in guarded utterances to trusted friends that he revealed his hearty disapproval of his country 's course .

		Despite the native pugnacity of his tempera - ment , he was always for arbitration rather than war , as the proper mode of settling disputes .

		His sense of justice also was too strong to per - mit him to countenance a wrong .

		* Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's book on '' Amer - ican Traits '' has already been before the read - ing public in the shape of articles published from time to time in two of our leading period - icals .

		Indeed , owing to their racy conversational style and entertaining comment upon American customs • American Traits , from the Point of View of a German .

		118 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, and affairs , the articles have been widely read and discussed .

		And small wonder ; for the zeal of the social philosopher , and perchance reformer , is upon the Professor , and he pro- nounces many uncharitable judgments on what he regards not as the natural faults of a still youthful and essentially struggling civilization , but as the failures of one already completed to come up to his own , necessarily German , ideals .

		In five articles , the author discusses those things which are regarded as chiefly at fault in this republic , -- to wit , the American char - acter , American education , American scholar - ship , American women , American democracy , -- matters which now have become world-renowned by being dragged through the dreary waste of foreign literature and served over again in the hash of newspapers .

		The author picks out in these what he regards as representative traits of American life , and bends upon them what he considers a friendly , yet avowedly not un - prejudiced , scrutiny .

		The result may be fore - seen .

		Except a very few features that may be retained , American culture and ideals sadly need regeneration .

		To answer such criticism in full would mean writing a much larger vol - ume , and a much more thoroughgoing expla - nation of the phenomena of our life , than Pro- fessor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	in his leisure hours , and with his limited opportunities for observation , has been able to do .

		The understanding of and familiarity with our problems which we have a right to expect from our critics .

		Pro- fessor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	as yet possesses not , and perhaps will never possess , since his point of view is essentially foreign to our ideas and in - stitutions .

		However great , in his opinion , is the similarity between what is German and what is American , this likeness is in fact but superficial , while the differences are funda - mental .

		Besides this German point of view , which makes nine-tenthsof his criticism worth - less as a corrective , the chief fault of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's book , and the one most fatal to its real value , is his habit of basing his eulogy as well as his apology -- in fact , his whole argument -- upon what he calls the typical , but which we feel impelled to call the exag - gerated or peculiar , character or situation found in a particular city or portion of the country .

		For representative purposes , there - fore , his material is hardly worth the time spent in gathering it .

		But Professor
Miin	PERSON	- sterberg strives for brilliancy of effect , not for plainness of truth ; hence his book leaves an impression of sham earnestness which more than anything else serves to discourage and offend the sincere observer .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	comes before the public with the confessed aim of creating a better understanding between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The way to do this , as the au - thor rightly perceives , is to change the mental attitude of each nation toward the other , thus effecting a juster valuation of the charac - ter , ideals , and institutions of each .

		What he may have said to the Germans about
America	LOCATION	is carefully withheld from us ; but what he wishes Americans to think about
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans is in plain print before us .

		It is with this purpose in view that he so persistently shows us our inferiority .

		All through the book , American ideals and institutions are compared with German , and the comparison is insistently in favor of Ger - many .

		This may be well-meant and patriotic in our author , but we doubt whether it will much help the ardent mediator in achieving the cordial enteinte which is declared to be the purpose of the book .

		The intelligent American who goes abroad makes observations for him - self ; and Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's enthusiastic guidance will not materially alter his view .

		Nor are we quite sure that the German nation is in all respects the one to be held up to us as a fit object to learn from .

		In some things ,
Germany	LOCATION	may rather learn from
America	LOCATION	.

		America is not , and has no desire to become , a
Germany	LOCATION	, but to hold its own course and solve its problems for itself .

		Every nation is in some way indebted to another ; the debt can be easily acknowledged , and the two remain on good terms as before .

		These two nations , however , are too different in political position , history , and tendencies , to benefit by conscious imitation .

		The social and political problems of a state such as
Germany	LOCATION	, and those of the free union suggested and realized by this com - monwealth , are of such widely different nature that what suits the one is by logical necessity almost excluded from the other .

		To try to make them fit together is another instance of the gnome running after the moon .

		Taking his articles one by one , there is no doubt that our critic 's remarks often contain much truth .

		The man must be born blind who can not see that this community has gone too far in some respects and not reached the medium in others .

		But what of it ?

		Every nation may have this said about it without blushing .

		It is not safe , however , for the out -

		THE DIAL 119 sider , who , with his limited observation , does not know the secret springs of health within , to suggest the panacea .

		If he wishes to know , let him , like Mr.
Carl Schurz	PERSON	and others , put his shoulder to the wheel of American progress ; let him attempt with us to work out some of our problems , and he will soon see with better vision where our difficulties and our failings really lie .

		The old-world standards of the good and the right do not fit the magnitude of our task , and we are trying to establish new standards in keeping with our conditions and ideals .

		To our German critic , this doubtless is mere cant ; and because it seems cant , he is unable to understand either our men and women and their relation to each other ; or the inferior degree of our scholarship and the ele - mentary character of our public education ; or the fact that the word `` democracy , '' like the word '' constitution , '' has a different and more native meaning in this country than it has any - where else .

		In his first article , which serves as an intro - ductory chapter , the author is in his most en - tertaining mood , as he shows the ridiculous exaggerations which the two nations consider representative of their respective peculiarities ; and he takes pains to dispel the common notion that
America	LOCATION	is altogether materialistic .

		This may be taken as the kindly act of a scholar who has been the guest of this country for seven years and enjoyed unbounded courtesy and facilities for becoming acquainted with the true character of this new world .

		Yet it is everywhere clear that the idealism which he finds here is not of such fine grain as the stamped and approved German article .

		The idealism of which we can boast is , to be sure , not so much concerned with profession as with realization , -- with giving the ideal a pair of stout legs on which to walk this earth .

		Our ideal is necessarily that of a commercial nation of republican instincts and liberal antecedents ; '' prosperity and equal opportunities for all '' is our creed .

		Hence the surface of our public life may easily impress an observer as a scrambling mass of hands and mouths yelling for booty ; but is there any country of any size which does not on fit provocation produce a like spectacle ?

		To Professor Miinsterberg it may easily appear that we have sold our birthright for a mess of pottage .

		But below the surface is the old , old current of stanch belief in the rights of man , a current which has not yet become sluggish , but remains a swell of enthusiasm such as in
Germany	LOCATION	, with her military regime , is fast dying away .

		Of this feeling , he sees but the fitful outbreak in political gatherings ; and it strikes him as puerile .

		Besides , is materialism altogether absent from the experience of foreigners who '' love and admire ''
Germany	LOCATION	?

		The quantity may not be so abundant , but the quality gen - erally makes up for it .

		In his chapters on Education and Scholar - ship , Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	has subjects with which he is more familiar , and his points of criticism are mostly both sound and well pre - sented : our lack of system and thoroughness , our inferior educational ideals , and our dom - inating mercantile spirit .

		Yet we are not altogether certain that our critic really under - stands just what ideals Americans have , or what education we are trying to give .

		The multitude of illiterate people that come to our country we attempt to make into citizens by giving their children equal educational chances with those of the best native families .

		Should not Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	consider what an exceedingly complicated matter edu - cation on these principles must be , and how little old-world systems will avail in the treat - ment of a heterogeneous population of such magnitude ?

		Our elective system , too , is found to be the source of many educational sins .

		But he overlooks the fact that our institutions , which accord equal rights to everybody , must also give to the individual the privilege of choosing the line of work best adapted to his temperament and natural gifts .

		With us , it is not the State that paternally decrees , but the commonwealth that leaves the choice with the individual .

		And the same principle which demands that the individual shall have this right , demands also as a further consequence that whether bright or dull , rich or poor , laggard or industrious , he shall lack no opportunity , no care , no pains on the part of the teacher to help him to see what his needs and adaptabilities are , and to have him learn what he set out to learn as fast and as effect - ively as possible .

		It should be no wonder that under these conditions we have many educators but few scholars .

		So long as this burden of bringing up new millions every year to the level of intelligent membership of a free coun - try remains with the teacher , so long will his whole energy be consumed in his work .

		For this side of the educational labor , with its en - ormous responsibility .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	has little sympathy ; yet the devotion to this democratic ideal of benefitting each for the 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ultimate good of all has caused generation upon generation of students and scholars to lay aside their ambitions and obediently perform their task till they are ground to powder in the educational mill .

		Such an article of faith may very likely seem something like nonsense to a foreign and unsympathetic observer , but on it is founded our national greatness .

		The typical higher school of
Germany	LOCATION	and the
Gymnasial	LOCATION	- lehrer have no counterparts in this country ; but we doubt whether the educational ideal , after all , is higher there than here .

		In his fourth article , on American women .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	has done what , with his uncertain grasp of our institutions , he could least afford to do : he has censured the edu - cated American woman , despite his flattering comments on her individual charm , as being nothing less than a social supeifluity , an article of luxury , if not a danger and a nuisance .

		Of course .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	is here , as else - where , especially thinking of our beloved Bos - ton , which is rich in women of culture , ambition , capacity , and often leisure as well .

		In
Boston	LOCATION	there are plenty of women who do not marry , who go to lectures instead , or pursue profes - sional careers ; and these , by mere force of numbers , have given him the impression that in
America	LOCATION	all culture is in the hands of wo - men , while men are ousted from some of their especial offices .

		Hence it is time for our social reformer to call a halt , and remind us of the true woman on the other side of the water , who knows she is but an appendix and makes no special claims for herself .

		Yet , judging from recent events , we might imagine that this German woman wishes to be in the clothes of her American sister rather than otherwise .

		In speaking of the equality between the sexes , which he declares Nature never admits , our critic has been guilty of a trifling mistake in the use of words .

		Nature certainly admits equal forces and influences , though not similar functions .

		We think it is due to a true under - standing of the difference between `` equal '' and '' similar '' that American life has assumed its varied aspect and that the American woman in her professional capacity can make her influ - ence felt as she does .

		It is not strange that men of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's type should , after some trifling with the matter , be anxious to have women kept properly within the bound - aries of domestic exclusiveness .

		But the rea - son why they should strive to get beyond these bounds is undoubtedly their inborn right to strive for whatever intellectual prizes their capacity may reach .

		The law of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, which has assumed constantly greater significance in the human mind and stands behind all demo - cratic institutions , allows women an entire right to develop their faculties .

		Where slavery is abolished and serfdom an anomaly , the su - premacy of one sex over the other is also obso - lete .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's light nonchalant treatment of this subject is at best but an imita - tion of the raillery prevalent in certain circles of American university life ; yet such circles represent not the progressive but the reaction - ary element in our national life .

		Furthermore , the woman of whom he has so much to say is not the American woman as
America	LOCATION	knows her , but a species peculiar to but a small sec - tion of the whole vast area .

		Yet it is worth remembering that these very women seek a college education and enter a professional ca - reer for purposes that honor themselves and the civilization that fostered them -- a civili - zation which is , above all , ethical , as distinct from the aesthetic , the practical , or the phil - osophical , of which European countries may boast .

		There is something beautifully sug - gestive of the ultimate fulfilment of our dem - ocratic ideals in the hand-in-hand progress of our men and women toward a truer and com - pleter life and a nobler and freer society than the warlike traditions of the old world have created .

		The concluding article , on Democracy , ap - pears to us to carry the least weight of all the chapters in the book .

		Though we have an occasional laugh at the writer 's drollery , we regret that he can so little succeed in making his view convincing .

		Somehow our critic no - where truly realizes that we have traditions underlying our life as powerful as the traditions to which he refers as so superior .

		The good and the evils of this commonwealth are based upon the same thing -- individual liberty ; and this sacred right we are not minded to give up for any time-honored device , however glittering .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, if we may be so bold as to make a comparison , the individual , his wishes , his personal happiness and rights , are not factors to be much taken into account , but rather to be subjected to the welfare of the structure of which he is but an infinitesimal part .

		It is the
State	ORGANIZATION	which alone has liberty , power , wisdom , needs ; and the individual par - takes of these only in so far as he is in harmony with the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	has a truly B -RRB- ` zantine conception of the excellence of the omnipresent and omniscient government

		THE DIAL 121 which protects , trains , utilizes the individual for its own ends , but otherwise lets his life run in the established narrow groove .

		When read - ing his praise of the institutions of the father - land , it may occur to one to ask in what manner the German institutions reward the individual for the sacrifice of his identity .

		The almost daily growth of the socialistic party in that country is the surest sign that the individual does not look upon himself as so greatly bene - fitted after all .

		The marvellous iron scaffolding of officialism in
Germany	LOCATION	, however efficacious it may be in holding the four corners of the building together , can not prevent our seeing the big crack from top to bottom .

		But Pro- fessor
Miinsterberg	ORGANIZATION	's view of all these matters is the traditional and confirmed von ohen her ah attitude characteristic of the remoteness of university men of the semi-official upper classes .

		In studying American conditions the author sees not , what is only too visible , that our shortcomings are in the main faults of youth rather than of innate inferiority .

		As a nation we are still in the formative stage ; yet we are working not after the old models but toward new ones based upon our own peculiar require - ments .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	may be for - given for forgetting this , since his brief
Ameri	PERSON	- can life has been spent in the oldest centre of American culture ; but this does not exonerate him from the charge of recklessness in pub - lishing his ill-considered views , and thus in - voking a criticism which must necessarily be as severe in tone as many of his statements are crude and flippant .

		In conclusion , we may be permitted to ask : Would Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, if he lived in
London	LOCATION	or in
Paris	LOCATION	, be found lecturing the English or the French as from
Boston	LOCATION	he has lectured the Americans ?


Max Miiller	PERSON	stayed at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	for half a century ; but no one ever heard of any attempts on his part to reform the English , their educational methods , the characters of their men and women .

		Friendly criticism and admonition should neither be disdained nor resented ; but we believe that
America	LOCATION	can and must work out her own sal - vation , with little aid from foreigners who understand neither our people nor our institu - tions ; and whose criticisms , wholesome as they might be for us in some respects , lose their effect and value by reason of their unsym - pathetic point of view and the air of self - complacent superiority with which they are uttered .

		Theories of Life and Conduct .

		* Mr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	's latest book , `` Culture and Restraint , '' should have a wide reading .

		It is an exposition , well thought out and sys - tematically presented , of two methods of attain - ing the highest good , -- the method of self - expression and the method of self-repression , and of the relative merits of each .

		Since everyone must in a measure act according to one of these two methods , an understanding of wherein each is good and wherein each fails is of prime importance .

		The ideal of culture is the healthful outgoing of all human activities .

		These suggest and determine the life which man was meant to live ; let him therefore live that life naturally and fearlessly .

		The soul has room for all the world of beauty and of knowledge which man has conquered .

		Culture insists upon the duty of seeking the fulfilment of all human possi - bilities , of attaining and preserving health and integrity in every sense , of ripening all our powers to maturity .

		Our business , in the words of Bishop Blougram , is to '' make the absolute best of what God made . ''

		The aesthetic ideal saves its follower from vulgar standards , by showing him '' that there are larger things in the world than getting on , and more worthy things to worship than the great goddess of prosperity . ''

		It saves him , further , from pro- vincialism and narrowness of interest ; it brings wideness of outlook and catholicity of taste .

		It broadens the judgment and helps its follower to avoid one-sided views and hasty and preju - diced conclusions .

		It corrects the vanity of ignorance and gives true balance , or poise .

		Yet this ideal , in spite of its great value , has in the long run , taken by itself , always failed , not only in making life nobler and sweeter , but even in keeping true to its own best self .

		The effort to get the most out of life , to acquire the richest experience by '' ever curiously test - ing new opinions and courting new impres - sions , '' is apt to lead to the old philosophy of a short life and a merry one .

		Judged by the highest ethical standard , too , the man who makes self-culture his absolute ideal can not be acquitted of selfishness ; an illustration of this is seen in
Goethe	LOCATION	.

		This theory of the conduct of life fails , on the whole , because it takes a shallow conception of the needs of man and the world .

Feb. 16	DATE	, which '' restraint '' is too mild a word -RRB- is that of the ascetic .

		Self-control , moderation , avoid - ance of excess , are all good , even necessary to any scheme of life ; but the extreme type of self-repression , or asceticism , fails even more signally than the method of self-culture , since it is prohibition which does not prohibit , which can not prevent ; since , instead of removing , it only creates , temptation .

		Sacrifice , as an end in itself , '' is the barrenest and the most dangerous object man can set before him . ''

		In the teaching of Jesus , rightly understood , Mr.
Black	PERSON	thinks that both culture and sacrifice are reconciled and made reasonable by the thought of service . ''

		A man 's contribution to society will mean all the riches and resources of his nature , his heritage of race , and personal capacity , and education . ''

		Such , in brief , is Mr.
Black	PERSON	's thought .

		We can not agree with all of his conclusions , -- as , for example , that to define evil as simply the imperfection involved in finite being destroys the moral view of evil ; we regret , too , that he 80 persists in speaking in the now meaningless terms of a worn-out theology .

		Still , with his main line of reasoning and with his general conclusion we find ourselves in complete accord .

		* Two such works as
Francke	PERSON	's on German Literature and

		to secure the best instruction in literature and philology .

		Not that travel and study abroad are no longer desirable ; they will always be so , since the great manuscript stores are still in
Europe	LOCATION	, and since , moreover , contact with a variety of minds and methods will always be among the foremost elements of culture .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	is most widely known as one of the best of '' Faust '' editors .

		His in - terests have b.een supposed to lie chiefly with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, wherefore the announcement of his Life of
Schiller	PERSON	caused some little wonder .

		And in his Preface the author frankly admits that there was a time when his attitude toward
Schiller	PERSON	was scarcely so sympathetic as to war - rant undertaking to write his life , '' when my mind was very hospitable to demonstrations of his artistic shortcomings . ''

		But he adds : ''
Time	ORGANIZATION	has brought a different temper , and this book is the child of what I deem the wiser disposition . ''

		It has been said that every good poem is a self-revelation .

		Perhaps the same observation applies to every product of a man 's activities .

		Certainly it holds good in the case of this
Life of Schiller	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the treatment of nearly every phase of
Schiller	PERSON	's activity contains , as it were , strata from the earlier and the later stages of the author 's thought .

		Doubtless this was Pro- fessor
Thomas	PERSON	's plan ; but in any case the outcome is most advantageous for his readers , since they are thus presented with a more evenly balanced view of the favorable and the unfavorable estimates of
Schiller	PERSON	than could have been produced by one who had always held to either side of the unfortunate
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	-
Schiller	PERSON	contest .

		The result is , indeed , when both the favorable and the unfavorable opinions are vigorous and when they appear in close juxtaposition , an apparent inconsistency of judgment , but stubborn consistency is one of the worst vices in a critic .

		The self-revelation of our author lies in the conflict between his critical judgment and the spontaneous tribute of his heart to the noble mastery of the poet 's art .

		After all ,
Schiller	PERSON	and Goethe are touchstones for the spiritual and philosophical tone of those who deal with them .

		The one-sided realist will be repelled by
Schiller	PERSON	, and just as surely the in - tense idealist will recoil from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		But those who have , by turns or by fits , both ideal - istic and realistic sympathies , will find pleas - ure accordingly in both of the great Germans , and may even learn to see realistic leanings in
Schiller	PERSON	and idealistic strivings in
Goethe	LOCATION	.

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 And as the one or the other of these tendencies prevails in the student , even so is he inclined to yield precedence to one or the other of the poets .

		In general it is true that the critical temper is in sympathy with realistic methods , but the wide world loves an idealist .

		Criticism at first undertakes to tell us what we ought to admire ; in time it learns to be satisfied with explaining why we admire what we do admire .

		And so Professor
Thomas	PERSON	approaches
Schiller	PERSON	. ''

		For the poet who wins the heart of a great people and holds it for a century is right ; there is nothing more to be said , so far as concerns his title to renown .

		The creative achievement is far more precious and im - portant than any possible criticism of it .

		This does not mean that the critic is in duty bound to abdicate his lower function ; -- it means only that he will be best occupied , generally speaking , in a conscientious attempt to see the man as he was . ''

		Over and over again Professor
Thomas	PERSON	him - self sets the example which he commends in speaking of
Die Jungfrau	LOCATION	von Orleans : '' It was a great deed of poetry , in the presence of which a right-minded critic , after duly airing his little complaints , as critics must , will be disposed to doff his hat and say Bravo ! ''

		The appreciation of the poet is all the more grateful and convincing because it comes so often almost grudgingly , despite the theoretical condemnation .

		We may take as illustration of this , and at the same time of other features of Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's work , his treatment of
Die Jungfrau von Orleans	ORGANIZATION	, -- `` a tragedy in which he proceeds still further along the path of romantic idealization , proceeds indeed so far that one can no longer follow him without some rather serious misgivings '' -LRB- p. 372 -RRB- .

		Yet on page 375 we find : '' A dramatist is justified if his intention is good and he succeeds in it ... His experiment was received with ecstacy at its first performance and has ever since held its place in the affection of German play-goers .

		They are not troubled by its irrationalities , but receive them with pious awe , as
Schiller	PERSON	intended .

		For the reader , too , ' The
Maid of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	' has a deep and per - ennial fascination .

		Theorize about it as we may , it is a great popular classic , which has exerted an enormous educative influence , and proves how thoroughly its au - thor knew the heart of the German people . ''

		And then he proceeds to theorize on page 378 : '' As the play stands , however , it must be allowed that the demand made upon the imagination is quite too severe .

		The love-incident is preposterous in itself and a mere episode at that , serving no purpose finally but that of picturesque contrast .

		It is a sort of thing which one can put up with very well in a romantic opera , but not so well in a serious drama . ''

		And further , on page 378 : `` It is difQcuIt to justify such a scene upon any theory of poetic art . ''

		At this point Professor
Thomas	PERSON	undertakes to explain that such scenes -LRB- as that between
Johanna	PERSON	and Lionel -RRB- are tolerable in '' Lo - hengrin '' but not tolerable in a serious drama , because in the first case they are within the limits of tradition , and in the second not .

		But inasmuch as nine-tenths of the average audi - ence do not know the details of the tradition , the application of the distinction is not evident .

		However , let us continue our quotations .

		`` It is really quite futile to discuss the artistic rea - sonableness of this scene .

		If one likes it and is touched by it , very well ; but a prudent poet might well have had some regard for the very large number of people who would find such a scene ridiculous rather than touching . ''

		-LRB- P. 379 . -RRB-

		And yet on page 382 we read : '' It -LSB- Z -RRB- ie
Jungfrau	LOCATION	von Orleans -RSB- was a great deed of poetry , '' etc. , as already quoted .

		But on the next page : '' It must be admitted that a heroine who excites in - terest chiefly by virtue of her patriotic sentiments and the bravery of her conduct does not represent the highest type of creation .

		The muse will always lend virtue and bravery to any common poetaster for the mere asking ; but she does not so readily vouchsafe a convincing semblance of human nature . ''

		But on the other hand , on page 384 : '' Shall we then take refuge in the position that the Maid 's story is not adapted to dramatic treatment at all ?

		Such a position is at once rendered absurd by the perennial popularity and effectiveness of
Schiller	PERSON	's play .

		Until some great realistic poet shall prove the contrary by deeds , the mere critic is certainly justified in holding that , whatever may be thought of his love-episode , the ghost and the miraculous escape from bondage , the general requirements of the theme are best met by
Schiller	PERSON	's romantic treatment . ''

		On the page after this , we find the following anent the minor characters of the play : '' In short , the characters of `` The Maid of Orleans ' leave much to be desired on the score of verisimilitude .

		One has the feeling all along of being in an artificial world made to order by an imaginative fiat .

		To enjoy the play it is necessary to put aside one 's rationalism and surrender oneself to the illusion one knows that the author wishes to produce . '

		The
Maid of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	' does not compel the surrender , like *
Wallenstein	PERSON	' ; one must meet the poet half-way .

		That done , however , everything is in order , for the technique of the play is faultless . ''

		Finally , speaking of the end of the second act : '' One who is not touched by this portion of the play ; who does not return to it with ever renewed pleasure after each sojourn in the choking air of naturalism , is -- to state the case as gently as possible -- unfortu - nately endowed . ''

		After a series of such passages , we can imagine a reader asking in despair : `` But what , then , is Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's opinion of ' The Maid of Orleans ' ? ''

		Is it not evident that he 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, has various opinions of it ?

		And who that is honest has not ?

		One impression the reader is sure to get : that despite all technical defects , it is a great piece , and that Professor
Thomas	PERSON	, like other good Germans , finally doffs his hat .

		One whose allegiance to
Schiller	PERSON	and idealism has been unwavering might be satisfied with this tribute , but for a few traces of the old patronizing attitude , such as , '' Unquestionably Goethe at his best was a far greater poet than
Schiller	PERSON	'' ; `` Goethe 's was the rarer genius '' ; '' The other and higher method , as exemplified by Shakspere and also by Goethe '' ; '' It is not to be denied that his -LRB-
Schiller	PERSON	's -RCB- poetry at its best is seldom supremely good '' ; `` Unquestion - ably
Schiller	PERSON	lacked the supreme qualities that go to the making of a great world-poet '' ; and , most exasperating of all , '' A distinctly human
Johanna	PERSON	, -- such as Goethe might have given us had he turned his thoughts in that direc - tion ! ''

		Where is the use , please , and where the grace , in still insisting that '' one of the real immortals '' is less great than another ?

		Why not have let it stop with the generous Goethe 's own words : '' They ought rather to be glad that they have two such fellows '' ?

		A few mildly unfair criticisms might be pointed out .

		For instance , in the discussion of
Schiller	PERSON	's ballads , page 320 , it is mentioned , seemingly as a reproach , that '' not a smile is provided for in the whole list . ''

		Pray , do we expect to smile over ballads ?

		How many smiles are provided for in '' Lenore '' and '' Der Erlkonig , '' or in our old English ballads ?

		But the same reproach against ''
Wallenstein	PERSON	, '' page 353 , '' Humor plays no part , '' is hardly warranted by the fact .

		Not to mention the '' Lager , '' which is probably intended to be excluded from consideration here ,
Tiefenbach	PERSON	and Isolani in '' Piccolomini , '' IV. , 6 , are not wholly without humorous touches ; and
Isolani	PERSON	at the close of II. , 6 , ''
Wallenstein	PERSON	's Tod , '' certainly compels a smile .

		The dickering of Buttler with the murderers in ''
Tod	PERSON	, '' V. , 2 , has also some rather grim fun in it .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's style deserves comment .

		It is certainly clear and forcible .

		But it is more than that .

		It is distinctly individual .

		There is in it at the same time the freedom of conversation and the vocabulary of omniverous reading .

		It makes the difference between the handbook and the work of literature which this
Life of Schiller	ORGANIZATION	actually is .

		We have already quoted too much to feel free to cite more in illustration of the vigor and unconventionality of the author 's expression .

		The following brief tale of rare or unlisted words will prepare the intending reader for surprises : interjacent , strumous , cicisbeo , bewray , dubiety , cunctatory , operose , monodistich , religiosity , vulgarian , revenant , ineluctable , pococurantism , arach - nean , feaze .

		The fulness of the yet incomplete biog - raphies of Minor and Weltrich could not be rivalled -LRB- perhaps happily ! -RRB-

		in a single volume , and some side of the subject had to come short .

		Undoubtedly Professor
Thomas	PERSON	acted wisely in taking space for full literary discussions at the expense of petty biographical details .

		The student of German literature will find in this book the most helpful of material : clear and adequate abstracts and statements of
Schil	PERSON	- ler 's plots and purposes ; the frank and orig - inal utterances of a man of virile but refined taste regarding the times and the man ; an extraordinary variety and fairness of view taken all in all ; and a genuine enjoyment of the poet 's masterpieces which will prompt to reading at first hand and to re-reading for com - parison .

		It is not only an indispensable mem - ber of the library of every student of German literature henceforth , but it deserves a welcome from the wider public of general culture .

		The publishers have given the work a worthy dress in the dignified volume , with its solid paper , clear print , and valuable illustrations .

		* It is a disagreeable task to criticize a book which has been heralded by its publishers and praised by reviewers as an important contri - bution in its field : it is still more disagreeable , when the author of the book is a brilliant and charming woman .

		But no one who knows

Tweedie	PERSON	's ''
Mexico	LOCATION	*
Mexico	LOCATION	as I Saw It .

		By Mrs.
Alec Tweedie	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .

		THE DIAL 125 as I Saw It '' can review it without severe criticism .

		It is true that the title which Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	has selected for her book saves her from a great deal of criticism .

		One can hardly find fault with a simple narrative of what an author sees on a journey .

		And when Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	really confines her attention to what she saw in
Mexico	LOCATION	, she is interesting and on fairly safe ground .

		She saw some phases of Mexican life uoder exceptionally favorable circumstances .

		The President of the Republic was interested in her work ; governors , and their representa - tives , exerted themselves in her behalf ; rail - road officials extended to her every courtesy ; foreign residents vied with each other in show - ing her attention ; the best native Mexican society extended that gracious and beautiful hospitality which it knows so well how to offer .

		In describing these attentions and the places and things which they opened to her inspection , Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	is interesting and en - tertaining .

		But outside of the simple narrative of her own experience Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	's book is value - less .

		As a contribjition to knowledge of Mex - ico , it not only has no worth , -- it is often misleading .

		We need not search for evidence of this ; it may be found by simply opening the book anywhere .

		To show how fundamental her ignorance is , one example suffices .

		Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	sees but two types in
Mexico	LOCATION	, -- the Spaniard and '' the Indian . ''

		Yet neither the Spaniard nor the Indian is much in evidence in the greater part of the country through which Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	travelled .

		The cowboys of
Northern Mexico	LOCATION	and the common people of the cities of the high tableland are not Indians , though Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	so styles them .

		The true Mexican of the highland , is the mestizo .

		Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	seems never to have seen the name : true , at one point , when quoting -LRB- without ac - knowledgment -RRB- she misquotes the word , mak - ing it nestizo , and defining it as '' a performer of witchcraft '' !

		The word , however , is the common term applied to mixed - bloods .

		That Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	misprints her Spanish at times is excusable .

		We all do so , but while it is unfortunate , it does no great harm .

		We have but tried to write words as we heard them .

		But the case is different with Aztec words .

		These are gathered from reading , and we ought to be able to copy them from the printed page quite exactly .

		But our author mis-spells Aztec words often .

		Thus she writes hoyote -LRB- coyote -RRB- , dahali -LRB- javali -RRB- , and aquacate -LRB- aguacate -RRB- , and speaks of the god Fenecatl -LRB- Ehecatl -RRB- and the ruler Ahuistotl -LRB- Ahuitzotl -RRB- .

		This list of mis-spelled words leads us to Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	's remarkable statements in natural history .

		She speaks of howling wolves , and says she is '' well acquainted with their music and appearance '' -- yet describes them , under the name '' boyote , '' as `` small like a fox '' ; the little peccary or javali -LRB- her '' dabali '' -RRB- is said to be the '' wild boar '' ; the aguacate , she says , '' is a vivid green lemon used in salad '' -- yet she has eaten aguacates ; we are told that '' the lion and the panther '' live along the
Tampico	LOCATION	branch of the
Central Railroad	ORGANIZATION	, and might naturally infer that the lady is speaking of two animals , instead of one .

		Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	is probably the only person who has seen '' beautiful birds of paradise '' in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		She certainly had an unique experience on the tropical river , where '' a taper -LRB- sic -RRB- peered upon us from a bough . ''

		But Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	's natural history , peculiar as it is , does not surpass her ethnography and archaeology .

		These are sometimes observation , and sometimes quotation from or reference to authorities , whom she knows so little that she can not read their names after her notes are cold .

		She visited a '' cruciform cross '' in the neighborhood of
Mitla	LOCATION	; in the same region she saw walls of '' natural stones , -- adobes -LRB- the native sun-burnt brick -RRB- '' ; in
Oaxaca Valley	LOCATION	, she found , what will astound the best - informed ethnographers , stone-tipped arrows shot with blow-guns , -- as she says : `` A man will fashion his arrowhead in a few minutes -- five at most -- and with his long reed blow - pipe and stone head fixed to his arrow shoot with no uncertain aim ! ''

		-LRB- The exclamation mark is fortunately in the text ; it saves the reviewer trouble . -RRB-

		In one picture Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	represents a man in a '' grass coat made from cactus , '' and in the text identifies the species of cactus as the '' palm cactus '' ; the coat is not a grass coat , nor is it made of cac - tus , nor is chere a palm cactus .

		But Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	is at her worst in refer - ring , with an air of familiarity , to authorities in archaeology and ethnography .

		Poor
Seler	PERSON	will hardly recognize himself as Eeler .

		Bel - mar 's list of Oaxacan languages is almost un - recognizable , with five out of the thirteen names mis-spelled .

		And what can we say of her commendation of archaeological books , -- her list of the best ending with ''
Sandelier Medaillac	PERSON	's ' Prehistoric America . ' ''

		Poor
Bandelier	ORGANIZATION	's book dropped out of the hastily 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, jotted list and he himself sadly mixed with the
Marquis de Nadaillae !	ORGANIZATION

		But that
Sandelier Medaillac	PERSON	was as nearly correct as Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	knew , is clear from its having gone through the proof-reading and appearing in full in the index .

		We should find the statements regarding social and economic conditions quite as unre - liable , but we will not say more .

		We regret that Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	did not do a little serious study , if she cared to go at all outside of her subject -- ''
Mexico	LOCATION	as I Saw It . ''

		The religious views of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	have had a some - what fictitious importance attached to them because he was so early and profoundly imbued with the opinions of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Those who have never been equally burdened by a philosophy so spiritually barren are tempted to say , '' How this empirical creature is creeping heavenward !

		It is interesting . '' ''

		Two
Centuries of Christian Activity	ORGANIZATION	at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	'' is a work chiefly written by Professor
H. B. Wright	PERSON	.

		The narrative is clear , succinct , and instructive .

		Professor
Wright	PERSON	is supported by a variety of au - thors on special points .

		Many will enjoy the book , and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men will find it especially interesting . ''

		The Hearts of Men '' is the title of a peculiar , not to say a queer , book .

		In style it is a reiterated question ; in substance it is a series of unqualified affirmations .

		Its colors are white and black ; there are no grays .

		It presses hard on dogma in a most dogmatic temper .

		It attacks reason with a long and closely compacted argument .

		Yet the book is interesting and instructive .

		It has at bottom one profound truth , which needs constant enforcement , -- that religion is a thing of feelings even more than of thoughts , and demands our sympathetic apprehension in every form in which it offers itself .

		In the spiritual world , knowledge flows into feeling and feeling into knowledge with a pulsation which leaves neither significant without the other .

		If the author had presented his views with more propor - tion and qualification , he would have rendered bet - ter service .

		We unite the three volumes entitled '' Science and Christianity , '' '' The Doom of Dogma , '' and '' Is Christ Infallible and the Bible True ? ''

		.

		because they are all so extreme in their views , and , looked at as a product of Christian philosophy , so pathetic and so wearisome .

		They are the fruit of much thoughtfulness and patient labor , and yet they lead us to no sufficient results .

		Taken together , they nullify each other .

		Two are made up of extended and opposed criticism , and the third of minute and ineffectual defense . ''

		Science and Christianity '' seems to be written by one who holds fast to tra - ditional beliefs , and is more successful in accumu - lating material than in making use of it .

		The book is fitted to leave two impressions strongly : the closeness of the limits of knowledge , whether that knowledge pertains to religion or science ; and the readiness with which we fall into excess of asser - tion , whether on the physical or the spiritual side .

		We carry a flickering torch in a cavern ; we catch glimpses , lost as quickly as obtained .

		The author is keenly sensitive to the over-confident temper with which the new theology of science is urged , but does very little to help us out of the darkness .

		He fulfils his function in repeatedly declaring how dark it is .

		The author of '' The Doom of Dogma '' is equally fertile in criticism , but aims at the de - struction of dogma , not at its retention nor its re - statement .

		The criticism is extreme rather than
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 sober .

		That men of active minds should reach results so unfruitful , is not comforting .

		Rashly pushing forward and obstinately holding back are alike ill-timed .

		One does not wish to stand between books which express so earnest a phase of individ - ual lives and any readers they might otherwise secure .

		The first volume will bring to the reader many weak points in current theological specula - tions , and lead him to feel that current beliefs and unbeliefs are not so free of difficulty as they seem to be .

		The second volume will give him , in nearly four hundred pages , a great variety of criticisms which have accumulated against traditional beliefs , and leave him to make what way he can among them .

		The third volume will furnish him , in nearly seven hundred compact pages , an exhaustive and ex - hausting defence of the essentially infallible charac - ter of Scripture .

		Neither of the three volumes seems to us to grasp the true intent of dogma , as offering transition steps in intellectual and spiritual unfold - ing .

		The ultimate result of the destructive criti - cism seems preferable to that associated with ortho - doxy .

		The author of '' The Doom of Dogma '' affirms , though in an extravagant form , the unity of nature , of man , and ot God .

		The world is one and coherent .

		The author of the third volume reaches the conclusion of a conflict between reason and revelation , and the necessity of a choice be - tween them .

		We can hardly be surer of any one thing than of unity in God 's work and method .

		The work on '' Theology at the Dawn of the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' covers a wide field .

		It is made up of many brief contributions of men of ability and prominence , who represent a large vari - ety of opinion .

		It is sure , therefore , to have points of interest for an equally wide range of readers .

		Though the themes considered are principally doc - trinal , they include a few of a practical character , as '' Divorce and Re-Marriage , '' '' Religious Condi - tion of the Anglo-Saxon Race , '' etc. .

		It is the pro- gressive rather than the conservative element that is represented in the book , the attitude of the more thoughtful men rather than of the masses .

		It is the midway point among thinkers that receives em - phasis .

		Those who stray , either by holding back or pushing on , fail of representation .

		The book is a snap-shot at the head of the column .

		Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric
Harrison	PERSON	follows an analytic introduction by the compiler with an essay on '' Christianity at the End of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It seems to us unduly pessimistic .

		Mayor
Jones	PERSON	, in one of the closing articles on `` The Religious Condition of the Working Men in
America	LOCATION	, '' strikes a clearer and more cheerful note .

		The volume would have been more satisfactory if the practical side of
Christi	LOCATION	- anity had received more attention .

		There is no recognition of
the Labor	ORGANIZATION	movement , which has sprung up under the second great command , and has been more revolutionary of social sentiment than any other event in the century just closed .


John Bascom	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		The fallen Stuarts and their influence .

		Mr.
F. W. Head	PERSON	is the author of a scholarly monograph entitled '' The Fallen Stuarts '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , treat - ing of the services rendered to various European states by the several Pretenders to the English throne .

		The book is an elaborated essay which was presented for and won the Prince Consort Prize in
1900	DATE	.

		Necessarily the character of the study involved , as well as the regulations of the prize contended for , required that the author should pro- duce a scientific detailed treatise , enumerative of minute historical incidents , rather than a readable , popular book .

		Not that '' The Fallen Stuarts '' is unreadable , for Mr.
Head	PERSON	has done much to illumi - nate an exceedingly dry subject ; but its concise statements , and rapid reviews of connecting inci - dents preclude any general interest other than that of the close student of history desirous of examining the results of recent and specialized research .

		As a monograph , Mr.
Head	PERSON	's book takes high rank , for it is accurate , exhibits thorough study , is replete with references to the best authorities , and is logi - cal in arrangement .

		By far the greater portion of the work is devoted to the international rather than the insular influences of the Stuarts .

		The accounts of their attempted invasions of
England	LOCATION	are but briefly related ; while their relations with foreign monarchs , and their reception at foreign courts , are dwelt upon at greater length .

		Thus , in illustration of Mr.
Head	PERSON	's thesis , the exact use to which
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		wished to put the first Pretender ,
James II.	PERSON	, the effect of the latter 's presence at
Versailles	LOCATION	upon French international policy , the motives actuating the treatment accorded his royal refugee by the King of
France	LOCATION	, occupy all of the author 's at - tention to the exclusion of events and conditions in
England	LOCATION	attendant upon the revolution of
1688	DATE	.

		In like manner , very little space is devoted to noting the influence exerted , by the mere existence of the Stuarts in exile , upon the internal development of English church and state .

		The author 's thesis is , in short , the influence of the Pretenders upon for - eign policy in
Continental Europe	LOCATION	, and this ground he has covered with a scientific detail that renders his book a valuable if not a very interesting addi - tion to the historical literature of the period .

		An appendix of thirty-five pages contains illustrative extracts from the Gualterio Manuscripts at the British Museum .

		interesting addition to the rapidly increasing literature treating of '' Mycenean '' civi - lization .

		The author , Mr.
H. R. Hall	PERSON	, is an assistant in the department of Egyptian and Assyrian an - tiquities at the British Museum ; and is by location and training well equipped for his task of present - ing the results of archaeological discovery and of estimating their bearing on the great question of 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the origins of Greek civilization .

		In the substan - tial voluaie before us , Mr.
Hall	PERSON	has thrown together his notes made during the course of some years ' study of the problems of '' Mycenean '' archaeology .

		How modern the study of these fascinating ques - tions is , can be appreciated only by those who know that twenty-five years ago our knowledge of Greek history could hardly be said to have extended much further back than the beginning of the seventh century
B.C.	LOCATION	.

		In Mr.
Hall	PERSON	's words , ' • The Homeric period seemed to be entirely inolated ; an impassable gap separated the
Greece	LOCATION	of Homer from the
Greece	LOCATION	of Herodotus ; and behind Homer lay impenetrable darkness . ''


Schliemann	PERSON	's energy and enthusiasm , and the scholarly appraisal of his discoveries by cooler intellects , have , partially at least , raised this veil , and enable us in these early days of the new century to formulate working hypotheses which are successively more and more persuasive .

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	remembers , and reminds his readers , that we are not beyond the region of hypothesis .

		His own ex - planation of the phenomena he admits to be pro- visional ; but it is consistent with the facts , and is elaborately wrought out .

		He assumes , as to date , that the rich and varied civilization called * ' My - cenean '' was already nearly universal in
Greece	LOCATION	and had entered upon the period of its fullest de - velopment in the sixteenth century
B.C.	LOCATION	; and he believes that the Homeric civilization , traditionally dated to the
ninth century B.C.	DATE	, was a decadent form of that of
Mycenae	LOCATION	.

		Below the relics of the Mycenean -LRB- or Bronze -RRB- age , are found those of the '' Pi SB Mycenean '' or copper age , which dates roughly about
2000	DATE	B.C. .

		As to the curious and beautiful art-work called '' Mycenean , '' Mr.
Hall	PERSON	does little beyond repeating the conclusions and reproducing the illustrations of such works as
Perrot	PERSON	and Chi piez 's great ^ isioire .

		Schuchhardt 's `` Schlie - mann , '' and Tsountas and
Manatt	PERSON	's '' The My - cenean Age . ''

		His most original and elaborate work is done in tracing the lines of ethnic connec - tion between
Mycenae	LOCATION	and the Archaians , the Egyptians ,
PbcBuicia	LOCATION	,
Cyprus	LOCATION	, and
Crete	LOCATION	.

		The book is not for the general reader , nor even for the intelligent layman who is not acquainted with the previous literature of the subject .

		Its appeal is to the scholar who can weigh its arguments and estimate its conclusions .

		It is well printed and bound , and abundantly supplied with indices , ap - pendices , charts , and illustrations .

		The founder ^ ^ ^ removed as the spirit of our of the order modem life is from that of the ofst .

		FraneU .

		founder of the '' Brothers Minor , '' the story of so sincere a life , told with sympathetic directness , is not without its measure of appeal for a reader jaded with the tinsel glories of a popular novel .

		Mr.
James Adderley	PERSON	's ''
Francis	PERSON	, the Little Poor Man of
Assisi	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a brief but very finely appreciative study of the man and his influence upon his age .

		For the ordinary reader , the chapter on '' The Times of Francis '' might well have been a little longer .

		The generalizations with which it is mainly filled should have been supple - mented by particularizing details or illustrations , which would have saved the background against which the figure of the saint is seen from the hazi - ness that more or less obscures the significance of the man himself .

		But , with this reservation , it is a very bright picture that the lover of men and of all God 's poor and lowly things makes in these pages , from the time of his idle , flaunting youth , to the hour of his death , when '' with his songs were mingled those of the little birds he loved so well . ''

		Useless as seems now much of the self-abnegation that made up his life , the telling of it here reveals a most engaging personality , a sweet and inspiring faith .

		The story of the stigmata , the appearance of the marks of the crucifixion on the body of
Francis	PERSON	, Mr.
Adderley	PERSON	tells in quotation from the
Fioretti	PERSON	, thus escaping the necessity for expressing an opinion himself .

		The very beautiful frontispiece of St.
Francis	PERSON	sho , ws in the hands and the feet the marks of the nails .

		The book closes , sadly enough , with a showing of the return to worldliness of the Franciscans themselves , even during the lifetime of St.
Francis	PERSON	.

		Lincoln ^ ^ these days of scientific research , among hit and of application of iconoclastic coniemporarie * .

		methods to history and biography , a life of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	on old-fashioned lines seems unusual reading .

		The underlying thought of Dr.
Robert H. Browne	PERSON	's ``
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and the Men of his Times '' -LRB-
Jennings & Pye	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is , that the great war president was a chosen agent of
Providence	LOCATION	, a man for his time designed to meet a special exigency , just as Moses or Luther ,
Cromwell	PERSON	or
Washington	LOCATION	had been , each in his particular period of history .

		This idea appears everywhere throughout the twelve hundred pages filled with anecdote , reminiscence , and record of personal ex - perience .

		The author 's father , a Scotch engineer who settled in
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, in the middle of the
last century	DATE	, was a close friend of
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	, and the son grew to manhood in a com - munity which witnessed many of the everyday scenes in the life of great actors on the ante-bellum stage .

		At a later time he became identified with the fortunes of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	as a worker in the cause of the new Republican party , and had the best of op - portunities to know those who secured the nomina - tion for the '' Illinois rail-splitter '' at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	.

		This event is the culmination of the author 's story ; and a very interesting story it is , showing from the standpoint of an Illinoisan the forces which were at woik during the ten years before the war developing the man for the time .

		That things do not simply '' happen '' in politics , but come to pass according to deliberate plans carefully worked out , is clearly shown by Dr.
Browne	PERSON	.

		There is a vast amount of local coloring in this account of the environment surrounding
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	from his birth to his death , and also a good deal of the cur -

		In this age of innumerable '' process methods '' of pictorial reproduction , in which the sun and the kodak are usually the artists , it is refreshing to see a collec - tion of honest old-fashioned lithographs in black and white , and to find in them some '' artistic feel - ing '' as well as some skill in drawing .

		So we are grateful to Mr.
Thomas R. Way	PERSON	for having chosen lithography as his medium for depicting the '' An - cient Royal Palaces in and about
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

Eltham Palace	ORGANIZATION	,
Greenwich Palace	ORGANIZATION	, the Tower ,
Crosby Hall	PERSON	,
Savoy Palace	ORGANIZATION	,
Whitehall Palace	ORGANIZATION	,
St. James 's Palace	ORGANIZATION	,
Kensington Palace	LOCATION	,
Kew Palace	LOCATION	,
Richmond Palace	ORGANIZATION	,
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	, and
Windsor Castle	LOCATION	;
Buckingham Palace	ORGANIZATION	is omitted because of its lack of age .

		It might be doubted if lithography is the best pictorial method of presenting architec - tural details ; but Mr.
Way	PERSON	has certainly been very successful in grasping the picturesque features of some of his scenes .

		His subjects have not in all cases been inviting ; Americans who have never been in
England	LOCATION	will doubtless be surprised to see how unpalatial some of these royal palaces are in their external appearance , --
Kew	LOCATION	and
Kensington	LOCATION	, for example .

		Mr.
Way	PERSON	's pictures are accompanied by architectural , antiquarian , and historical notes , of great value and of deep interest , by Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric
Chapman	PERSON	.

		From these notes we may learn , for example , why it is that we speak of our '' am - bassador to the Court of St.
James	PERSON	. ''

		St.
James	PERSON	's Palace was once the hospital of St.
James	PERSON	the Less , And retained its saintly name long after it was transformed into a royal abode ; and it still retains the name , though it is now no longer a royal abode , but is yet admirably adapted to Court ceremonials .

Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a thoroughly useful and much-needed manual * ■ ' ■ intended to give infor - mation about the correctness of type-setting , which is not minutely taught in English grammars or clearly explained in technical manuals of printing . ''

		It is designed for the use of not only the printer and proofreader , but for all who are concerned in the production of the printed page .

		It has to do no less with the proper preparation of '' copy '' by the author than with its proper reproduction by the printer ; and , indeed , it is the author who is most in need of such instruction as the book affords .

		Writers for the press are too apt to assume that the niceties of punctuation , capitalization , com - pounding of words , and other essential details of correct composition , are the concern of the printer only .

		Careless and slovenly '' copy '' is too often the rule rather than the exception , as every printer and magazine editor knows .

		No writer , whatever his degree of experience , could fail to profit by Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	's concise and common-sense precepts and well-chosen examples .

		An invaluable feature of the volume is an appendix giving a list from which may be seen at a glance the variations in spelling , among the seven standard English dic - tionaries , of over sixteen hundred words .

		We should like to see a copy of Mr.

		^ qj , ^ ^ ^ ^ LoDgfcUow haS limited his field and has set forth only such principles as must needs be known to the practical draughtsman , pointing the students of the theory and science of perspective to a completer work which already exists for them .

		In his Preface , Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	advances the opinion that `` the practice of per - spective depends not so much on many principles as on the varied applications of a few , '' an opinion that is shared generally by perspective draughts - men .

		But to the knowledge of a few general principles and the power to apply them must be added a fine sense of perspective to save the draughtsman from running into serious complica - tions .

		The `` feeling '' for perspective is something that no book can supply , and the more finely this sense is developed in a draughtsman the less does he consciously depend on principles .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	- fellow 's book will help the general practitioner , for it not only shows how principles are applied prac - tically , but it illustrates their application by photo - graphs from art and nature .

		The

Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch .

		vania A very interesting story is that told by Prof.
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	in '' German and Swiss Settlements of
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		While a review of the conditions in the homeland following the religious wars gives the historic setting , and the importance of religious questions in determining movements of population is clearly shown , the author has made a successful 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, effort to treat the subject from a social standpoint , and thus has produced a very convenient handbook regarding the ''
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch . ''

		The reader finds interesting details about the way in which the oppressed peoples were attracted to
America	LOCATION	, now by a translated pamphlet by
William Penn	PERSON	, now by the influence of a letter from an old friend or by the conversations of a returned colonist sent back to
Germany	LOCATION	to lead others to the land of peace , or again by some wily agent of a transportation com - pany .

		The privations of the journey and the toil - some efforts in the wilderness find equal place with the certain improvement in temporal condition and the moral and social influence upon the new country .

		An attempt is made to show what the race has done for the history of the commonwealth , and the claims are made without partisan prejudice or special pleading .

		A liberal use of footnotes permits the introduction of many brief items of interest ; a bib - liography indicates the growing literature regarding the general subject ; and in the appendix is to be found a discussion of Pennsylvania-German family names with annotations of much value .

		On the whole the little volume is the most complete and inter - esting for the general reader that has yet appeared about this element of the pioneer population of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A list of more than one hundred and fifty titles shows something of the literature of the subject , and also suggests again the earnestness ' and zeal with which in recent years the claims for the minor elements of our colonial population are being advocated .

		Literature in '' ^ ^ ^ Earlier Renaissance '' -LRB-
Scrib	ORGANIZATION	- Buropeinthe ner -RRB- belongs to the series entitled early
16th century	DATE	, u Periods of European Literature , '' and edited by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		It is the fifth volume in the serial order , and the seventh in the order of publication .

		The editor is in this case also the author , as in the case of the volume on `` The Flourishing of Romance , '' which has the second place in the series .

		The period of the new volume is roughly the
first half of the sixteenth century	DATE	, which assigns to it the names , among many others , of
Erasmus	LOCATION	, More ,
Ariosto	PERSON	,
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Politian	LOCATION	,
Rabelais	LOCATION	, and
Hans Sachs	PERSON	.

		The opening chapter , called '' The Harvest-Tide of Humanism , '' discusses the Latin writing of the period .

		From this the transition is easy to the Italian vernacu - larists of the Cinquecento , thence to the French epoch here styled '' From Rhetoric to Pleiad , '' thence to the Elizabethans who were -LRB- mainly -RRB- be - fore
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		A chapter on German literature then follows , then studies of early dramatic and critical writing , and the work ends with a few ran - dom notes on Scandinavian , Dutch , and Slavonic authors .

		The book has all the familiar character - istics of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's work ; it is exasperating in style , but gives evidence of enormous reading .

		It is as even in execution as one has a right to ex - pect , and in point of accuracy is not open to serious criticism .

		For some prominent men of the past , ■ ^ ' ^ ortii/eof ^ complete biography in the com - pass of a magazine article seems an absurdity ; but for the dashing
Paul Jones	PERSON	, Mr.
Hutchins Hapgood	PERSON	's little life in the `` Riverside Biographical Series '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is sufficient for all readers except special students .

		This is due to the skill of the writer , who has been able on this small canvas to paint a complete picture of the man , and to set forth in sufficient detail his bril - liant and important work for his adopted country .

		We have him here , with his burning ambition , hi '' reckless but well-calculated daring , and his profes - sional skill .

		He is thus summed up : '' As far as his deeds are concerned ,
Paul Jones	PERSON	appears in the popular consciousness as he really was , -- a bolt of effectiveness , a desperate and successful fighter , a sea captain whose habit was to appear unexpectedly to confound his enemies , and then to disappear , no one knew where , only to reappear with telling effect .

		He has been the hero of the novelists , who , expressing the popular idea , have pictured him with essential truth .

		A popular hero , indeed , he was , and will remain so , justly , in the memory of men . ''

		That a woman should have passed the mountain passes , overcoming hunger and cold , gained the good will of the wild tribesmen among whom she was thrown , beat off or escape the attacks of robbers , and penetrated almost to
Lhasa	LOCATION	, the sacred city , and finally returned to her starting point , after seven months spent within the frontiers of

		This valuable work combines theory , criticism , and statistical fact .

		In the theoretical part the author exposes some fallacies as to financial crises and panics and offers a positive theory which is reasonable and tenable .

		His analysis of partial gluts and of misdirected production as a chief element in producing crises and depressions is an important feature .

		Attention is called to the greater prominence in recent years of periods of depression and also periods of prosperity , and the decreased prominence of sharp and severe crises or panics .

		The author 's con - nection with large business interests , his long experience as a lawyer , and his service in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, where he has been conspicuously identified with important committees , have afforded a wide and valuable equipment .

		For bankers and others in financial and business life , and for general readers of financial books and advanced students , Mr.

		Nearly
seventeen years ago	DATE	, the death of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, at the age of eighty-three , plunged into mourning the whole civilized world .

		At
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's age , and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's , within a few months , he entered into rest , and of all the great men of European letters since Shake - speare , those two alone seemed worthy to be named with his .

		For more than half a century , his rank had been preeminent , not among French writers alone , but among those of the whole world , and his venerable declining years had been crowned with such glory as is won by few indeed among the sons of men .

		His genius had so dominated the century which it illus - trated that it seemed as if history must hence - forth remember the period by his name , and speak of the Age of Hugo as it speaks of the Age of Dante or the
Age of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now that the years of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's life , added to the years that have elapsed since his death , have made up the full sum of one hun - dred , and men touched with his spirit and in - spired by his message are engaged -- not alone in the country that has the first claim upon his memory -- in recalling his splendid services to humanity and his priceless contributions to the treasury of that literature which has the breath of life everlasting , -- now that the centennial year of his birth has been reached , it becomes pertinent to ask how time has dealt with his reputation , and how strong is still the hold of his works upon the artistic sense and the con - science of the generation that has come after him .

		The final appraisal is not yet possible , nor will it be for perhaps a hundred years to come , but some things may now be said that our posterity will not be likely to repudiate .

		For it must be remembered that Hugo 's work has been tested by the apparatus of the critic during a much longer period than the term of years that he has been in his grave .

		It is now three-quarters of a century since the famous pronunciamento of '' Cromwell '' was delivered , and it is nearly as long since the pitched battle between the romanticists and classicists that was occasioned by the premiere of '' Hernani . ''

		During all that time , the genius of Hugo has 142 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
March 1	DATE	'' been hotly championed by some , and bitterly assailed by others .

		When he died , detraction had already done its worst upon him , and his fame had emerged well-nigh untarnished from the smoke of the critical conflict .

		Since
1885	DATE	, his assailants have found nothing to say of him so severe as what was said long before that date , and the recognition of his finer qualities -- always admitted by those who dealt with him the most roughly -- has been less grudgingly admitted even by those who have felt bound to enter their caveat against his acceptance as one of the great figures in the history of liter - ature .

		We have observed with close attention the currents and counter-currents of recent opinion concerning Hugo 's work , and it seems to us that there has gradually shaped itself , in the consciousness of his own compatriots as well as in the consciousness of the cosmopolitan tribunal of letters , an image of the poet that looms larger and larger as the age recedes from him , an image so colossal that it dwarfs all others of his world-contemporaries in the re - trospective vision .

		Can we as Englishmen , great as must be our reverence for the mem - ories of Shelley and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and Ten - nyson , of
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, can we in fairness claim that any of these men matches Hugo in artistic and moral sta - ture ?

		Can a German make the claim for
Heine	PERSON	, can an Italian make it for
Signor Carducci	PERSON	, can a Kussian make it for Tourguenieff , can a Norwegian make it for Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	?

		Can a Frenchman fairly make it for Musset or Balzac or Renan ?

		To ask these questions , it seems to us , is to make it clear that negative answers are the only possible ones .

		Certain aspects of the genius of these other men may appeal to us more deeply , or strike more responsive chords in our consciousness , but the noblest personality of them all , with the sum total of its achieve - ment , set beside the personality and the achieve - ment of Hugo , must suffer in the comparison . ''

		The spiritual sovereign of the nineteenth cen - tury , '' Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	calls him , and , whatever critical reservations we may make upon this point or upon that , it seems that the ascription is still the just due of the great poet , novelist , and dramatist whose writings have now been steadily pouring from the press for a period of nearly eighty years .

		Against this secular canonization of the poet the devil 's advocate has advanced three main charges .

		The first is that , while parading omniscience , he is guilty of gross inaccuracies of scholarship and grotesque perversions of the truth .

		This charge may fairly be allowed .

		`` L'Homme Qui Rit , '' for example , is a ro - mance pour rire ^ as far as its background of historical fact is concerned . ''

		Notre Dame de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' with its '' deux tours de granit faites par Charlemagne , '' is not in much better case , although its subject is the history of the poet 's own country .

		In short , the history of Hugo 's blunders is as lengthy as it is amusing .

		The second charge is that he is a rhetorician , who cultivated a turgid , bombastic , and sensational manner of composition , instead of following in the footsteps of the great masters of style .

		This charge has a qualified truth , although it reduces for the most part to the complaint which the classicist always makes of the ro - manticist , and begs the deeper question which is really at issue .

		And if ''
Hernani	PERSON	, '' for example , is rhetoric rather than poetry , as perhaps it is , what splendid rhetoric it offers its readers !

		When before in the French drama were '' points '' ever made with such telling effect as in this melodramatic inven - tion ! ''

		Vous n'allez pas au fond , '' '' Cou - vrons nous , grands d'Espagne , '' `` Dieu !

		je suis exaucee , '' '' J'en passe , et des meilleurs , '' -- how the examples crowd upon the memory !

		It may be rhetoric , but the emotions which it arouses are not readily to be distinguished from those which we experience from the purest tragic poetry .

		Concerning the third charge , which makes the poet out as a person of unbounded egotism and colossal self-esteem , it may be admitted that Hugo frequently spoke of himself in terms that his truest friends might wish had been left to others to formulate .

		Yet modesty and self-effacement are virtues that may be carried too far , and in Hugo 's case their assumption would have been a hypocritical affectation .

		The prophet must be self-conscious , else he is no prophet ; he must have an exalted sense of his mission , and a fervent belief in the truth of his message .

		And if any nineteenth cen - tury utterance may be called prophetic , it was surely that of the man who proclaimed that '' Le pofete , en des jours impies , Vient preparer des jours meilleurs , '' and whose faith in the sacredness of his calling did not waver to the end .

		Posterity never condemns a man for taking the true measure of himself , even if that measure be a large one ; it is only to his contemporaries , and dur - ing the period when his true dimensions are the subject of controversy , that such self - \
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 appraisal seems an act of questionable taste .

		When we read of Shakespeare declaring that his rhyme shall outlive '' the gilded monu - ments of princes , '' or of Dante saying , with magnificent arrogance , -- the question being of an important embassy , -- '' S'io vo , chi sta ; s ` io sto , chi va ? ''

		we applaud rather than con - demn , we admire rather than deride , the abso - lute conviction of the phrase .

		Posterity has accepted these men at their own estimates ; it is more than possible that posterity may accept Hugo at his own estimate .

		There are spots upon the sun -- this is about the substance of what unsympathetic criticism discovers in its examination of the work of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		But those who all their lives have bathed in the sunlight , and felt its vivi - fying warmth , are content to be simply grateful , and will not , for knowledge of the sun-spots , declare the moon to be a more satisfactory orb .

		The positive achievement of Hugo is so im - mense that a volume would be needed for the barest summary .

		Leaving aside his miscella - neous prose , descriptive , fanciful , speculative , critical , and political , there remain the three great categories of strictly creative work , poetry , romance , and drama .

		This seems to be the order in which they will eventually stand , the order in which serious criticism has already placed them .

		To the creator of '' Hernani , '' * ' Ruy Bias , '' and ''
Marion Delorme	PERSON	, '' we must give the credit of accomplishing the romantic revolution in French dramatic art .

		To the creator of `` Notre Dame de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' '' Les Miserables , '' and '' Quatre-vingt-treize , '' we must give the credit of promulgating a new conception of the teachings of history and a new gospel of social solidarity .

		To the creator of '' Les Contemplations , '' '' Les Chatiments , '' and '' La Legende des Sifecles '' we must give the credit of first revealing the full singing possibilities of the French language , of rising to such a height of lyric expression as had been attained by no French poet before , of crown - ing the splendid edifice of French literature with its supreme revelation of pinnacled beauty .

		In this lyrical domain Hugo out-sang all the other poets of his age , and most of the poets of all ages ; he rose as upon the pinions of the eagle , and matched the richness of Pindar ; he soared as with the skylark 's wings , and matched the pure note of Shelley .

		When at the height of his inspiration , he poured forth strains of everlasting melody , which were yet linked in thought with the noblest aspirations of the human spirit ; for his genius , while ever striving after the beautiful , never forgot its allegiance to the true and the good -- to the other aspects of what must ever remain the triune ideal of the soul of man .

		One thing more must be said to round out this commemorative tribute to the poet whose centenary is now at hand .

		Of another great poet it has been written : '' It is indeed Forever well our singers should Utter good words and know them good Not through song only ; with close heed Lest , having spent for the work 's sake Six days , the man be left to make . ''

		It is '' not through song only '' that we love and cherish the memory of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		To the man also our tribute is due -- the man who spoke brave words for freedom when such words were most needed , the man who , at the sacrifice of all that was dear to him , translated into action the faith that was his , and made his protest against tyranny doubly eloquent by his example .

		One of the most grudging of his English critics is inspired to enthusiasm by the contemplation of the chief act in Hugo 's life , and writes of it in terms of such admiration that we can suggest nothing to add . ''

		The great fact remains .

		M. Hugo , in scorn of am - nesties and invitations , lived out nineteen years of exile ; his voice did not fail nor his heart falter ; he stood on his rock in the free British seas , like
Elijah	PERSON	on
Carmel	LOCATION	, spokesman and champion of all those who had not bowed the knee to Baal . ''

		The example is one for all time and for all men .

		Only one man in a cen - tury may embody his protest against wrong in a volume of '' Chatiments , '' but every man may have the strength of purpose to stand for what he believes to be the right , whatever the forces that are leagued against him .

		In these lax days of service to the spirit of compromise , there is no lesson more needed than that of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's ''
Ultima Verba	PERSON	'' -- those words which seemed futile enough at the time of their deliverance , but which , in the light of sub - sequent history , are seen to have been the very sign and seal of the poet 's prophetic function .

		THE
JOHNS HOPKINS	PERSON	ANNIVERSARY .

		It has become somewhat difficult to picture to ourselves the conditions which surrounded the work of higher education in the
United States	LOCATION	in
1876	DATE	.

		Wonderful as the industrial advance of the country during the last twenty-five years has been , it is not at all more striking than the educational progress 144 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
March 1	DATE	, which has carried us far from those provincial con - ditions .

		It is easy to quote figures : -- four hun - dred graduate students -LRB- in arts -RRB- in
1875	DATE	, six thousand in
1902	DATE	, -- or those sums of money in - vested which the newspapers use as the ready and exact measure of academic greatness .

		But there has been a change of spirit , or at any rate of atti - tude and emphasis , which statistics can not adequately express .

		In
1876	DATE	the phrase '' higher education '' usually meant college education ; now , when it is used by a careful speaker or writer , it is likely that he means an education which begins where the college leaves off .

		In that year , while it had lately ceased to be true that most Americans desiring training of that kind sought it in
Germany	LOCATION	, it was still true that those who desired and could afford to have it under favorable conditions went there to obtain it .

		Now , the ratio of those who are pursuing it in
America	LOCATION	to those who are pursuing it in
Germany	LOCATION	is as fifteen to one .

		Many teachers devote them - selves to this sort of training exclusively .

		Men who have not received it , in some measure , can not hope for employment in colleges , can hardly hope for places in the best schools .

		The great public draws somewhat definitely the line of distinction between university and college , and shows already a high appreciation of the methods and achieve - ments of the former .

		The professional schools in - tended for the education of doctors and lawyers and ministers have been elevated and broadened by the same impulse , and by the example of the grad - uate schools of letters and arts .

		It is because of the singularly important part which the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	has played in this remarkable movement that the celebration of its twenty-fifth anniversary has been regarded in the academic world as an event of national signifi - cance .

		About a generation ago a rich
Baltimore	LOCATION	merchant resolved to devote his fortune , in sub - stantially equal parts , to the foundation of a uni - versity and of a hospital .

		Neither he nor the trustees to whom in his life-time he entrusted the former project had much knowledge or experience of universities and their management ; but they had the sagacity to choose and to follow wise ad - visers , and the courage to approve and sustain a novel experiment .

		At the tenth anniversary the president of the board of trustees told the remark - able story of the choice of a president for the con - templated institution .

		They wrote to the presidents of six of the leading universities of the country , asking them who was the best man for the post .

		All six gave the name of the same man --
Daniel Coit Gilman	PERSON	, then president of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		No one doubts that they were right .

		Most persons would agree that nobody but Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	could have created in
Baltimore	LOCATION	the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	that we know .

		It is his mon - ument ; and it was only natural that he should be the central figure of the celebration of
February 21	DATE	and 22 , though he resigned the presidency last autum.i ij ^ to the hands of Dr.
Ira Remsen	LOCATION	, whose formal inanguration occurred on the second day of the recent festival .

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	and his trustees resolved , not to add to the educational system of the country one more college just like the rest , but to cap it with a uni - versity in which graduate instruction , elsewhere faintly beginning , should be the main object .

		Training in original investigation , and the publica - tion of important researches in scientific journals supported by the university , were to be its constant task .

		Professors were to be chosen who were great investigators , and were to be given every facility to continue their researches while teaching .

		The chief investment was to be in men .

		Expenditure on build - ings was to be kept at a minimum .

		Sylvester dis - coursed on the Abelian and Theta functions ,
Gil	PERSON	- dersleeve began the training of a generation of Grecians ,
Rowland	PERSON	conducted his researches into the mechanical equivalent of heat , in modest old - fashioned Baltimorean dwelling-houses .

		The new university was to raise its influence to the second power , so to speak , for it was to teach the teachers of
America	LOCATION	.

		It all seems obvious enough in
1902	DATE	,
Columbus	LOCATION	having long ago balanced the egg ; but to us of
1876	DATE	it was a revelation .

		Entrance into the at - mosphere of the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	was , to those who went there in its earliest days , like the opening of the
Pacific	LOCATION	before the eyes of
Balboa	LOCATION	and his men .

		Here were no dated classes , no campus , no sports , no dormitories , no gulf between teacher and student where all were students , no compulsion toward work where all were eager .

		Moreover , the intel - lectual freedom was such as befitted a university having the admirable motto , ''
Veritas	ORGANIZATION	vos liberabit . ''

		As time has gone on , other universities , with en - larging resources , have developed their graduate schools , while the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	has had a period of pecuniary difficulties -LRB- now apparently ended by the generosity of its
Baltimore	LOCATION	friends -RRB- ; and has felt obliged , besides supporting a medical school of the highest class , to put much of its strength into its undergraduate department .

		Nevertheless , the concourse of representatives of other universities at the recent celebration , and the tone of the addresses which some of them made , showed that the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, past and present , still holds a high and indeed unique position in relation to the most ad - vanced work .

		Hundreds of enthusiastic alumni , all of them young of course , yet many of them already distinguished in science , testified to the fruits of the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	experiment ; it is a rare college , in whatever part of the land , that has not at least one
Hopkins	PERSON	man in its faculty .

		And the citizens of
Baltimore	LOCATION	showed , by their presence , their enthusiasm , and their hospitality , how cordially they appreciated the school and the occasion .

		On the
evening	TIME	of
February 20	DATE	there were re - unions of the men who had worked in particular
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		145 laboratories or departments .

		The pupils of Pro- fessor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	commemorated his quarter - century of service by a dinner and the presentation of a memorial volume made up of contributions to classical philology written by divers of their num - ber .

		On the next afternoon , at
Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	, in the midst of a memorable storm , the formal exercises began .

		The President , the President Emeritus ,
Cardinal Gibbons	PERSON	, and a long train of trustees , university presidents , delegates , guests , professors , and alumni marched in , in imposing procession .

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	, in a most skilful and comprehensive address , reviewed the history of the last twenty-five years , and set forth once more those Hopkinsian ideals which he has so often before expounded on
Commemoration Day	ORGANIZATION	, and which he has done so much to make the common property of educated
America	LOCATION	.

		Then Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, the most eloquent of the alumni , in their behalf presented to Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	a beautifully illumi - nated address commemorating with gratitude and affection his labors for the university and his ser - vices to education , -- services , it was justly said , * ' not surpassed by those of any other American . ''

		The address was bound as a volume with the auto - graph signatures of
1012	DATE	alumni ; its presentation was accompanied by a demonstration from the audience which , coming from such a body of men , could not but be very grateful to Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	, many as are the honors and commendations which he has received .

		After this , there were short addresses of felicitation by
Principal Peterson of McGill University	ORGANIZATION	,
Montreal	LOCATION	,
President Hadley of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, President
Dabney	PERSON	of the
University of Tennessee	ORGANIZATION	, and President
Harper	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
evening	TIME	, there was a brilliant reception in the principal hall of the university .


Saturday	DATE	was President
Remsen	PERSON	's day .

		The morning 's exercises began with an address of wel - come by the governor of the State of
Maryland	LOCATION	, who had been unable to be present on the preceding day .

		Governor
Smith	PERSON	expressed forcibly and even eloquently the pride of Marylanders and
Balti	LOCATION	- moreans in their university , and declared with an emphasis which his position made significant his conviction that the state should , as of late it has been asked to do , assist pecuniarily in the mainten - ance and development of the institution .

		This duty , by the way , was eloquently enforced upon the minds of the alumni , at the dinner in the
evening	TIME	, by the doyen of presidents of state-aided universities , President
Angell	PERSON	of
Michigan	LOCATION	.

		President
Remsen	LOCATION	, in his inaugural address , studiously avoided pre - dictions and declarations of policy .

		But his de - scription of the proper spirit and aims of the uni - versity 's work , and his cheerful confidence in its future , left no doubt of his high success , -- certainly no doubt in the minds of those who know his serene and genial temper , his honesty and good sense , his intellectual breadth , and the devotion he has shown to the university during his twenty-five years ' ser - vice as professor of chemistry .

		After the conferring of honorary degrees .

		President Eliot of
Harvard	LOCATION	, who from the first foundation of the university has been its faithful friend , made a brief but impressive closing address .

		He frankly declared the obliga - tions of all other universities to the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, saying that it had lifted all to a higher level ; and he warmly praised the work of its young medical school .

		The rest was social : a luncheon at the
Johns Hopkins Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, and in the evening the alumni dinner , with large attendance and excellent speak - ing , presided over by Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here the President Emeritus described in general outline the present plans of the
Carne	PERSON	- gie Institution , of which he has just been made president , and Dr.
Remsen	PERSON	gave a description , very interesting to the alumni , of the beautiful Homewood tract of land , at the north of the city , which by the munificence of a few citizens has been given to the university as a site for its future home .

		The inauguration of a new president marks always a new point of departure in the history of an American university , especially since it became customary to lodge preponderant power in the hands of one man .

		But in the present case there are still other , and manifest reasons for expecting a new era in the development of the Johns Hop - kins .

		Removal to the new site will no doubt soon take place , and will make a difference that it is hard to estimate .

		There will be more room , greater quiet , the influence of beautiful surround - ings , a better opportunity to foster the social and athletic life of the undergraduates .

		On the other hand , the heart of a great city is in some ways a better place for a great university than its outskirts , and graduate work in some departments must suffer at least until the library has become so far devel - oped that remoteness from the
Peabody Institute	ORGANIZATION	has ceased to be important .

		It is also evident that , however generous the people of
Baltimore	LOCATION	are dis - posed to be toward the university of which they have become so proud , the city is not rich enough to enable it to maintain , in comparison with uni - versities planted in wealthier towns , the preemi - nence in graduate work which for several years it enjoyed .

		Let us hope that they will enable it to remain in this respect an equal , though doubtless with a constituency less national and more largely Southern , than in its first years .

		But there were phases of the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	celebration which suggested also the close of one era in the general life of American universities at large , and the opening of another .

		In the making of doctors of philosophy , as in other new American industries , there has naturally come first an era of competition , a competition not ignoble and not without public utility , yet marked by some regret - table excesses .

		The reaction has already set in .

		The first and most important influence exerted in restraint of excessive competition has been that 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, of the many national scientific societies , in each of which , at their annual meetings , the professors of many colleges join in discussing the matters of their common
Fach	PERSON	and in laying plans for its ad - vancement .

		They meet as friends , and immerse themselves for the time in concerns which transcend those of any particular college or university .

		When they go home , the sense of these wider interests abides in their minds ; and they can be relied on to uphold them .

		All universities have members -- presidents or others -- who are veritable academic Chauvins , consumed with myopic zeal for their own universities .

		They are growing fewer .

		The set who attend scientific meetings are holding them in check .

		Again , the most potent source of what is called commercialism in American universities is the unchastened ambition of presidents , eager for the pecuniary -LRB- assumed to be identical with the intellectual -RRB- aggrandizement of their own institu - tions .

		Against this evil also the most effective counterweight has been the zeal of professors for larger and loftier interests , which must be harmed by vulgar competition , but wijl be signally for - warded by inter-university friendship , cooperation , and dependence .

		This broader spirit has grown rapidly in recent years .

		The university presidents themselves have joined in an association for the annual discussion of common topics .

		The age of mutual combination is displacing that of competi - tion .

		Of the '' outward and visible signs '' of this new and most welcome stage of progress one of the most agreeable is the cordial enjoyment and fra - ternal feeling with which all the universities join in the celebrations of any one among their number ; for , in the profoundly Christian phrase which President

		In connection with my review of Mr.

		* '' The readers of
Jane Austen	PERSON	, '' so Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has lately told us , '' are hardly ever less than her adorers : she is a passion and a creed , if not quite a religion . ''

		IjE Mr.
Howells	PERSON	himself is to be taken as fairly exemplifying the attitude of the cult , we need not question his terms ; with him
Jane Austen	PERSON	is assuredly a passion .

		If , on the other hand , we feel that his praise is a little warm to be representative , we shall still be in no doubt of the existence of admirers whose enthusiasm will insure a cordial welcome for
Miss Constance Hill	ORGANIZATION	's delightfully sympathetic volume entitled ``
Jane Austen	PERSON	: Her Homes and her Friends . ''

		Of course there may be '' adorers '' of Miss
Austen	PERSON	who are content to study her as she laughingly whispers , '' What a dear , simple old gentleman ! ''

		from her shadowy corner behind Mr.
Woodhouse	PERSON	's chair ; or as she peeps demurely and very unobtrusively over
Elizabeth Bennet	PERSON	's shoulder , still smiling kindly at the Vanity Fair -- not , in spite of
Solomon	LOCATION	, all vanity -- which she analyzes so keenly and paints so deftly .

		Other admirers will not care to go beyond Miss
Austen	PERSON	's let - ters , as delightful in their way as her novels , and marked by the same dainty finish , the same freshness and vivacious wit .

		And if such readers want a background of biographical detail , they will choose a brief sketch like Mrs.
Maiden	PERSON	's in preference to anything more am - bitious .

		But Miss Hill is quite safe in counting on the twentieth century zest for what may be called the geography of genius ; on the modern temper , which , distrustful that the style -- at least in the novel -- is the man , wants to hear its literary lion roar ; or , if that is impossible , to know how , and furthermore where and in what company , he learned to roar in print to such purpose .

		Just such a study of environment Miss Hill offers us .

		Her book is primarily a record of her pilgrimage to '' Austen-land , '' -- or shall we say to the Austen-lands , since Miss
Austen	PERSON	lived successively in the little Hampshire vil - lage of
Steventon	LOCATION	, at Bath , at
Southampton	LOCATION	, and finally in

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 made lengthy visits , her home or lodging has been searched out that it may be carefully described , and also pictured for us by Miss
Ellen Hill	PERSON	, whose quaint little sketches add much to the interest of the text .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	was not essentially an out-door woman -- in her day fragile and feminine were likely to be synonyms , -- nor does description of natural scenery play any considerable part in her novels .

		So Miss Hill 's task is limited to telling us of each home and its garden , always a favorite resort with the ladies of the
Austen	PERSON	family , of the houses at which
Jane	PERSON	visited oftenest , and of the Assembly rooms where she indulged her fondness for dancing .

		Among her friends her large family stood first and indeed almost alone , if we are to judge by Miss Hill 's account .

		Dearest of all was her only sister
Cassandra	PERSON	, from whom in her childhood she was so inseparable that her mother once declared , '' If
Cassandra	PERSON	were going to have her head cut off ,
Jane	PERSON	would in - sist on sharing her fate . ''

		She was very fond of all five of her brothers ; but
Henry	PERSON	, who helped her with the publication of her novels , and
Edward	PERSON	, who after his father 's death gave his mother and sisters a home , were perhaps her favorites .

		Her father and mother , while closely associated with her , seem to have inspired awe rather than such affection as she lavished on
Cassandra	PERSON	and later on some of her young nephews and nieces .

		With them ends the tale of friends to whom Miss Hill has accorded more than mere mention .

		Her unique contribution to
Austen	PERSON	literature , then , consists in her conscientious picture of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's environment .

		Further than this , and as corollary to it , she aims to portray Miss
Austen	PERSON	's character , as her friends saw it and as her home life revealed it , and to trace the connection between the author 's ex - periences and the scenes and incidents of her novels .

		In this latter attempt Miss Hill is particu - larly successful in the first third of her book , which is devoted to
Jane Austen	PERSON	's life at the
Steventon	LOCATION	parsonage .

		Here , except for a `` short school course '' and an occasional visit , she spent the first twenty-five years of her life .

		Very uneventful years they were in the main , passed in the pleasant companionship of her own family circle and of three or four congenial neighbors .

		She read and embroidered and kept house , paid calls , revelled in the balls at the
Basingstoke	LOCATION	Assembly rooms , and was oc - casionally thrown into a delightful flutter of excitement by a letter or perhaps a flying visit from one of her sailor brothers .

		She lived , in short , the wholesome village life that she por - trays , and she lived it quite in the spirit of her heroines .

		For though the first drafts of '' Pride and Prejudice , '' '' Sense and Sensibility , '' and '' Northanger Abbey '' were written at
Steven	PERSON	- ton , '' amid the cheerful chatter '' of the family sitting-room , there was not then -- indeed there never was -- anything of the professed authoress in
Miss Austen	LOCATION	's view of life ; and here na doubt lies one secret of her genius .

		Miss Hill does not stop at such general re - semblance between
Jane Austen	PERSON	's environment and the setting of her novels .

		The '' wood walk '' at the parsonage reminds her of the pleasure grounds of
Cleveland	LOCATION	in '' Sense and Sensibility . ''

		Frank
Austen	PERSON	's letter telling of his promotion to the rank of commander sug - gests those announcing a like good fortune for
William Price	ORGANIZATION	.

		At
Bath Miss Austen	ORGANIZATION	's visits to the '' Lower Rooms '' are reminiscent of
Catherine Morland	PERSON	's first meeting with
Henry Tilney	ORGANIZATION	.

		And her stay at
Lyme	ORGANIZATION	makes an opportunity for conducting us , as
Tennyson	PERSON	insisted upon being conducted , to the scene of
Louisa Musgrove	PERSON	's accident . ''

		Do n't talk to me of the
Duke of Monmouth	ORGANIZATION	, '' cried the poet to his friends who were doing the honors of the historic village , '' show me the exact spot where
Louisa Musgrove	PERSON	fell ! ''

		While these parallels between
Miss Austen	PERSON	's personal experiences and the life portrayed in her novels are kept up all through the biog - raphy , the general reader 's curiosity about the genuineness of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's realism is satisfied by the time the
Steventon	LOCATION	period of her life has been recounted .

		He has then made sure that for once at least the style is emphatically the woman .

		He sees that it was because she dealt with the life she knew intimately that she was able to master her material so perfectly ; because she loved her dull little world , finding it neither too small nor too dull to be intensely interesting , that she was able to show its un - derlying charm and its real significance , -- in short to mould it into the form we call art .

		Very properly , then , through the rest of her book Miss Hill is chiefly occupied with de - picting
Jane Austen	PERSON	's personality , as her little circle of friends knew it and as her home life showed it .

		Here she is of course on ground trodden by all Miss
Austen	PERSON	's biographers ; and like the rest she must depend for her material upon Mr.
Austen Leigh	PERSON	's memoir of his dis - tinguished aunt , upon the various editions of 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, her letters , and upon family manuscripts re - lating to her and now in the possession of the
Austen	PERSON	family .

		But if this feature of
Miss Hill	LOCATION	's work is least original , it is perhaps most remunerative for the reader .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	is after all of interest not as having lived here or there and done this or that , but as being
Jane Austen	PERSON	, a personality powerful enough to domi - nate her quiet life and give its rather bare chronicle charm .

		Her life was indeed without incident and , in spite of the efforts of all her biographers , including Miss Hill , to prove the contrary , apparently without romance ; but about herself there is nothing commonplace .

		Her sprightly wit and unaffected sweetness endeared her to all who knew her .

		Her won - derful energy made novel-writing a mere epi - sode , not interfering at all with household duties , needlework , charities , or the visits of nephews and nieces .

		More remarkable still is her perfect poise -- that of the real humorist .

		If she ever lost herself it was in pleasure at the success of her novels .

		For the most part she maintained absolutely that mean between ab - sorption and ennui which marks the temper of the great artist ; who , playing his part in life 's drama , still can catch the critic 's point of view , but who is always too much the player to grow cynical over the tinsel whose deceptive charm he himself has felt .

		Such is the picture Miss Hill gives us .

		Occa - sionally the personal narrative form of the book is too obtrusive ; but the style is always admir - ably clear , the verification satisfactory , and the material interesting .

		It remains only to speak of the illustrations , which , besides the numer - ous sketches of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's homes and haunts already spoken of , include many photogravure reproductions of family portraits .

		Another feature of the book is the dainty cover design , which is a facsimile of the embroidery upon a muslin scarf worked in satin-stitch by
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		Owing to a bequest from the late Lord
Gifford	PERSON	, one of the judges of the
Scottish Court of Session	ORGANIZATION	, each of the four an - cient seats of learning in
Scotland	LOCATION	-LRB- the Uni - versities of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
Glasgow	LOCATION	,
Aberdeen	LOCATION	, and
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has now a sum of money which yields from
$ 3000	MONEY	to
$ 4000	MONEY	a year for lectures by men of note upon the problems of Natural Theology -- the ultimate meaning of the uni - verse so far as its bearing upon man and his destiny is concerned .

		A lecturer is invariably appointed for two years , and the universities in their wisdom have seen it fit to exact of him only ten lectures a year ; so that the fortunate appointees , in addition to the honor of the election and the subsequent profit from publi - cation in book form of their lectures , enjoy the remunerative features of giving some twenty lectures at from
$ 300	MONEY	to
$ 400	MONEY	a lecture .

		The appointment of a lecturer lies entirely in the hands , not of the head of the university -LRB- as might perhaps be the custom with us -RRB- , but of the professors , in particular in the hands of the professors of philosophy and theology -- in consultation , to be sure , with their colleagues .

		By the terms of the will no conditions what - ever of religious belief or disbelief are to be considered of importance in determining the election of a lecturer .

		The appointee may be - long or not belong to a religious body or de - nomination .

		And also , by the express conditions of the bequest , the lecturer is not allowed in his argument to place explicit reliance upon any so-called positive revelation .

		He may , in - deed , be known in his private capacity to rely upon Revelation for a solution of the question of the mystery of the world ; but in the
Gifford Lectures	ORGANIZATION	before the universities and their public he is to dwell especially upon a philosophy or theory of the teachings of nature and of human reason .

		As in the case of a great many recent be - quests to universities , the universities them - selves had at first grave doubts and difficulties as to the way in which the Gifford money could best be spent .

		To most men of mature years who have passed the greater part of their lives in scientific and philosophical investigation there seems to be something rather fatuous , something almost serio-comic , in the spectacle of four men getting up every winter before the public in four different Scottish towns to attack the old question of the proofs for the Being of God .

		And indeed it must be confessed that it is a somewhat serious expenditure of time and nervous energy to listen year after year
1902	DATE	J THE DIAL 149 -LRB- as must a sufficient number of professors to make up a platform for politeness ' sake -RRB- to the same eternal debate on a question that you may , in your own way , believe to be evident or to be insoluble by mere science .

		For after all the man who does his duty , or the '' least '' in the kingdom of heaven , may have visions de - nied to a great logician or specialist .

		Be all this as it may , the Scottish universities found in the law courts that they must spend the money very much in the way indicated in the will of Lord Gifford , who had been known to be a profound student of the pantheism of Spinoza and to have the most decided kind of opinions about the importance of Natural The - ology .

		All attempts to use the Gifford money for the creation of special chairs or lectureships or fellowships for the study of the science of religion , or of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	religions , or of com - parative religion , or what not , had to be aban - doned .

		And so for all time we shall see every year in
Scotland	LOCATION	these four men standing forth and offering reasons for their scientific or phil - osophic creed ; and we shall soon have an array of published volumes whose magnitude will altogether surpass that of the celebrated Bridge - water Treatises or of the
Oxford Bamptou Lectures	ORGANIZATION	.

		The very giving of these lectures and the issuing of these volumes may to the minds of many , who have perhaps a groundless prejudice against state universities , seem to be a somewhat disturbing influence upon the minds of young people in
Scotland	LOCATION	, in making them think of certain matters as unsettled rather than settled .

		But on the other hand , all lovers of truth and progress and light can not but welcome this provision for unprejudiced in - quiry into and discussion of the greatest ques - tions that can occupy the mind of man .

		And all true
Scotchmen	PERSON	can again pride themselves upon the fact that , while their country may justly be known as a land where a sound atti - tude upon the deeper realities of life is an in - gredient in the national temper , it will also continue to be known as a thinking country -- as a country where men look before they leap .

		And it would indeed be an evil day for
Scot	PERSON	- land or for any other country when the univer - sities , the special creation of the Protestant spirit , should stand before the public for any - thing else than truth and light above all things .

		It was natural enough that the Gifford lec - turers should be drawn , in
the first few years after 1888	DATE	, from within
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and that such well-known thinkers as
Hutchison Stirling	PERSON	, the two Cairds ,
Andrew Lang	PERSON	,
Max Miiller	PERSON	,
Campbell Fraser	PERSON	-LRB- one of Barrie 's '' Edinburgh Eleven '' -RRB- ,
Lewis Campbell	PERSON	, and others , should start the series .

		Men of science , too , like Sir
George Stokes	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, were also selected .

		But soon the Scottish pro- fessors , who could , of course , hardly hand round the lectureships among themselves , had to look abroad for help , and called upon schol - ars like
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	of
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Tiele of Holland	ORGANIZATION	, and
James	PERSON	and
Royce of Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
James	PERSON	has as yet delivered but one series of lectures .

		Unlike most of the works that have appeared in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	since the early days of the '' Hegelian invasion '' into our philo - sophical world -LRB- it was forshadowed of course by the Transcendentalism of
Carlyle	LOCATION	and Em - erson -RRB- , i. e. , since the first writings of
Hutchison Stirling	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	-LRB- the famous '' Secret of Hegel '' -RRB- and the Cairds of
Glasgow	LOCATION	and
Green of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	-LRB- once as famous as the editor of the '' Journal of Specu - lative Philosophy '' as he now is as the
United States Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the pub - lished lectures of Professor
Royce	PERSON	lay their main emphasis not upon an impersonal '' Uni - versal '' or '' Absolute '' in which God and man and the world seem to be fused into one another , but rather upon the Individual and his free moral effort and upon a Personal Deity who has both Reason and Will .

		Hegelianism or Neo -
Hegelianism	PERSON	-LRB- for the English interpretation of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	does not represent all the sides of his teaching -RRB- has been , as nearly all college gradu - ates of the past two decades know , the inspir - ation of the Idealism that has nobly served as a counter philosophy to the growing Naturalism and the Materialistic Evolution of the
last third of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	himself only too gladly confesses in his lectures the extent of his debt to the writings of
Kant	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	and their followers , and indeed it may be said that without their work his work and nearly all the important work in recent philosophy would have been impossible .

		But all the deeper students of Neo-Hegelianism know from their own experience how well - grounded have been the complaints of the upholders alike of '' Orthodoxy '' and of '' Com - mon Sense , '' regarding the extent to which the realities of man 's separate personality , the re - alities of individual effort , of right and wrong , of the personal will of God , seem to suffer in
Hegel	PERSON	's '' Panlogism , '' as it has been called -LRB- if this be
Hegel	LOCATION	-RRB- -- in that '' dialectic '' or moving - shadow world in which an eternal thinker seems 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, to be eternally thinking his own mere thoughts , or to be setting up logical difficulties merely for the pleasure of overcoming them .

		So far does `` Hegelianism '' sometimes seem to travel from the world of ordinary reality that some of the most important events of the philosophical world of the last twenty-five years have been the conversions or the confessions or the recan - tations of distinguished thinkers who were once deeply imbued with the very spirit and letter of what they believed to be Hegelianism .

		Two of the most conspicuous instances of these re - cantations have been the writings of the accom - plished successor of Fraser at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in the chair of
Hamilton	LOCATION	, -- Professor
Andrew Seth	PERSON	-LRB- now A. S. Pringle-Pattison -RRB- , whose return to the rationality of the but recently despised Scottish '' Common Sense '' philosophy was doubtless the occasion of the interest manifested in his Princeton lectures upon Theism ; and , further , the brilliant and epigrammatic writ - ings of
F. H. Bradley	PERSON	, the popular Oxford thinker who is regarded by many men of letters as the English master of the art of dialectic , -- as a modern Parmenides .

		In the great meta - physical treatise of Bradley on '' Appearance and Reality '' -LRB- dubbed by some witty critic the '' Disappearance of Reality '' -RRB- a kind of nega - tive Hegelian dialectic is turned against the re - ality of the '' Neo-Hegelian '' God , and thus the very pillars of that spiritual philosophy , which has kept a generation of men from turning to the '' husks '' of materialism , seem for the moment to have been torn down by an intellec - tual
Samson	PERSON	.

		And in the wake of these two older men several of the younger thinkers have not been slow to follow , in books and articles that draw inspiration not merely from
Hegel	PERSON	but from `` fresh fields and pastures new '' that - have been partly ignored by the Hegelians .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as we read in a
London	LOCATION	review -RRB- a number of young men have banded them - selves together to produce a volume of essays that shall do more justice to personality and aspiration and the moral life than has been accorded to these things by some of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's followers .

		It is the distinctive merit of Professor
Royce	PERSON	's published lectures to have given , as the result of a logic as rigorous as that of Bradley or Green or
Caird	PERSON	, an idealistic philosophy of the world , in which a separate reality and a genuine moral experience and a personal immortality are given to all finite beings who are capable of '' working out '' with the help of God -LRB- he be - lieves in this too , as does the Hebrew Psalmist or the Apostle Paul -RRB- their salvation .

		It may be claimed that just as the great book of Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	has closed hy a negative criticism the first Neo-Hegelian period in English thought , so the lectures of Professor
Royce	PERSON	are the first great positive attempt in English to rise beyond the closed circle that was for some time wrongly taken to be the essence of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lec - tures have already been discussed in this light at the annual meeting of the
American Psy	ORGANIZATION	- chological Association at
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION
last Christmas	DATE	, and they are certain to affect the constructive period of philosophy upon which we are entering with the century . ''

		It is precisely , '' says Professor
Royce	PERSON	, '' the restor - ation of individuality to the self that constitutes the essential deed of our Idealism . ''

		Of course out of all this preliminary polemical work will there come in due time a fuller and juster ap - preciation of
Hegel	PERSON	and
Hegelianism	PERSON	, for it is eternally true that
Hegel	PERSON	's philosophy is to a great extent but another name for systematic thinking and that `` outside ''
Hegel	PERSON	there is no philosophy .

		But Professor
Royce	PERSON	's work is interesting for another reason .

		Next to the interests of theology and a common sense justice to the divine rights of the personality of man , there is perhaps no question that so interests the popular mind of today as the social question .

		Theology itself , in fact , is becoming -LRB- not al - together rightly to be sure -RRB- largely a social gospel , and the reality of the life of the indi - vidual is held by some to lie in his power of '' losing '' it to find it again in the life of others .

		And from the standpoint of philosophy it must be confessed that the '' social spirit , '' the social conception of the '' self '' and the socio - logical conception of the world , have practically revivified the metaphysic of to-day .

		No one need be surprised at this .

		The student of philosophy can tell the average man that both in
Germany	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	some of the most cogent tests of the reality or the unreality of any philosophy have always been found in the writings of men who have shown its bearings upon our common life as human beings .

		The socialistic writings of
Marx	ORGANIZATION	and
Lasalle	LOCATION	kept alive the spirit of Hegelianism long after its letter had ceased to have a hold upon the Ger - man mind ; and in
England	LOCATION	itself the social writings of men like
Edward Caird	PERSON	-LRB- whose little book on Comte is one of the best things he has done -RRB- and
Mackenzie	PERSON	and Bosanquet have revealed the social mission of Idealism at a time when the technicalities of
Hegel 's Logic	ORGANIZATION
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 are ignorantly supposed to have been set aside as a kind of jargon of the schools .

		The social spirit and the social idea have had the very greatest kind of influence upon Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	.

		Without at all entering into precise detail , it may be said that one of his most fundamental positions is to the effect that it is only in our dear daily life of common effort , in the life of family and state and '' church , '' that man enters into his true king - dom -- enters upon the realities of what he -LRB-
Royce	PERSON	-RRB- calls the World of Appreciation -LRB- i. e. , the world of '' ideals '' and '' values '' -RRB- , as dif - ferent from the appearances of the World of Description -LRB- i. e. , the world of '' sense '' and '' science '' -RRB- .

		The '' appearances of the World of Description '' !

		Yes !

		that is one of the main lessons of the book , -- the sad error of materi - alism and materialistic living !

		That the world of physical science , the world of '' atoms '' and '' cells '' and '' motion '' and '' laws , '' is in a very vital sense an '' appearance '' world -- I will not say an unreal world , but an apparent world , a world that is simply a version or description of the world in the interests of our moral and intellectual life !

		It is only from the standpoint of the social and ethical life that we can logically -LRB- the pith of the argument is to show this -RRB- regard our life of sense and all the physical world as essentially a meaning -- a meaning that is completed in the certainties of the religious life .

		Paley used to talk about design and purpose .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	talks about meaning ; that is ,
Paley	PERSON	saw things from the outside , whereas Professor
Royce	PERSON	sees them from the inside .

		No wonder that
Darwin	PERSON	and Huxley refuted
Paley	PERSON	!

		The chief effort of the lectures upon '' The World and the Individual '' is to show that the reality of everything , or of anything , is to be found ultimately in its meaning ; and the true meaning of the life of the world and of sentient beings is to be found in one vast Society , one great realm of beings , whose lives find their meanings com - pleted in a Kingdom of God , -- a kingdom in which human beings live again to realize < * All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good ... '' The ordinarily educated person who has an interest in the higher thought of this age , or the thinker who is troubled about the `` evolu - tion hypothesis , '' will find a great deal in Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	's two volumes .

		And their thor - oughly practical character may be said to set forth on a large scale the possible contribution of the American spirit to the solution of old and world-wide problems .

		America has every reason to be proud of her first lectures in the Gifford series .

		We shall look forward to the lectures that another American philosopher , Professor
William James	PERSON	, is at the present time giving at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, for his book called '' The Will to Believe '' has already created quite a voluminous literature .


William Caldwell	PERSON	.

		Our Younger Poets .

		* The minor poet has fallen upon fortunate days .

		So much attention is paid at the present time to literary production of every sort that the humblest of writers gets his share of ephem - eral glory .

		It was not always thus , and form - erly the minor poet had to be content with the furtive publication of his slender volume -LRB- at his own expense -RRB- , with a few lines of com - ment , kindly or severe , and with the halo that encircled his brow in the eyes of his family and immediate friends .

		But now he gets him - self into print without difficulty , receives grave attention at the hands of novelists , clergymen , and other competent critics , and enjoys some - thing very like fame for at least a brief period .

		So it comes to pass that such a book as Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	's '' Poets of the Younger Gen - eration , '' containing over five hundred pages of characterization and extract , can secure both a publisher and a public .

		We are determined to magnify our poets , and , since the greater voices are nearly all silenced , the lesser voices have their innings , and are treated as if they also were gifted with the divine accent and the prophetic utterance .

		We have no thought to speak scornfully of the minor poet , or to begrudge him any of the honest praise which Mr.
Archer	PERSON	bestows upon him .

		We have often , in all sincerity and thankfulness , bestowed upon him the same sort of praise , and discussed him in the same spirit of seriousness .

		Yet the sight of this big and sumptuous book , with its array of names all of which have yet to be tested by time , somehow suggests a disproportion between means and ends , and the anticipation of a verdict that can not in the nature of things be returned until most of us who are now living are in our graves .

March 1	DATE	, better that opinion concerning these persons should shape itself by natural processes rather than be given thus prematurely the semblance of a permanent form .

		Again we must disclaim any intention of impugning Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's motives in producing the present volume , or even of disputing his main positions and judgments .

		The book , de - spite its bulk , is essentially modest and unpre - tentious , and the author takes us so frankly into his confidence that adverse criticism is for the most part disarmed in advance .

		The story of the book is , briefly , that Mr.
Archer	PERSON	enjoys poetry , that he has read widely among the younger poets of our time , that he has selected thirty-three of the English and American writers who have most appealed to him , and that to each of these he has devoted a few ex - pository pages , abundantly eked out with illus - trative examples .

		The book is subjective in method .

		The author tells us what he likes , and evidently hopes that his readers will like it also .

		If they do not , and he should be asked to justify his judgment , he would be quite helpless .

		He admits that he has not included certain excellent poets for the simple reason '' that their work does not happen to chime with my idiosyncrasy . ''

		Intellectually , he rec - ognizes their merit , but it does not touch his emotions .

		Everything that the objective critic regards as fundamentally important is eschewed by Mr.
Archer	PERSON	.

		He makes no comparisons , invokes no canons of literary art , traces no re - lations between the poet and the tendencies of his age .

		He simply tells us what he likes and what he dislikes .

		In order that we may reckon with the per - sonal equation in Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's estimates , he supplies us with a sort of spiritual autobiog - raphy , in which we learn when , and by what means , his taste for poetry developed , what are the poets who mean the most to him , and to what others he is relatively insensible .

		In doing this , he adopts a suggestion of Mr.
John M. Robertson	PERSON	, who declares it to be the critic 's duty to give his readers '' an opportunity of checking his individual judgments . ''

		Says Mr.
Archer	PERSON	: '' The day may very well come when every critic will be called upon to fill up -LSB- a -RSB- schedule of temperament and qualification , in order that readers may know clearly through what medium they are invited to contemplate any given work of art . ''

		A note to this pas - sage embodies what we should be tempted to think a jest were it not for the author 's con - fession on the next page that he is '' a pure - bred Scotchman . ''

		The note is to this effect : '' It might perhaps be desirable , for the guid - ance of the person criticised , that a statement of the critic 's athletic record , his chest meas - urement , and his fighting weight should be included . ''

		Coming to the author 's confession of taste , we learn that he is insensible to music ^ save of the simplest , that he had the usual boyish attack of Byronism , and that from Words - worth he learned the true meaning of poetry .

		Greek and Latin poetry mean little to him ,
Chaucer	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	much .

		Milton he did not really discover until nearly thirty , but that poet has been to him ever since '' an in - exhaustible mine of the pure gold of poetry . ''

		When it comes to
Shelley	LOCATION	, he says ''
Sibbo	PERSON	- leth '' in defiance of those who would slay him '' at the passages of
Jordan	PERSON	. ''

		Of American poets ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Whitman	PERSON	are the chief .

		German poetry he loves , although he cares more for
Heine	PERSON	than for
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, but to French poetry he remains color-blind .

		After the frankness of these confessions , we are pre - pared for an occasional surprising saying , as , for example , that he would be puzzled to dis - tinguish from internal evidence the poets who wrote '' Songs from
Vagabondia	LOCATION	, '' and that there is no very wide gap between Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's Omar and the immortal poem of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every man has a right to his own opinions , and we can not quarrel with one who makes no effort to erect his subjective fancies into objective dicta .

		What we find , then , when we turn from the introduction to the volume proper , is a series of pleasantly written discussions of such of our younger poets as Mr.
Archer	PERSON	likes suffi - ciently to care to take into consideration .

		The list of poets is worth giving .

		On the English side , it comprises Messrs.
Beeching	PERSON	,
Benson	PERSON	,
Binyon	PERSON	, Quiller-Couch , Money-Coutts ,
David	PERSON	- son ,

Nesbit	PERSON	,
Radford	PERSON	,
Siger	PERSON	- son ,
Watson	PERSON	, and Woods -- eight women .

		Of this list one may say that a number of equally important names are omitted , but that it is excellent as far as it goes .

		The selection of the eight American poets can not be accounted for by any process of rational thought .

		They include the three Canadians ,
Messrs. Roberts	PERSON	,

Archer	PERSON	, these four are Miss

Santayana	PERSON	, Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	, and Father
Tabb	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	would have done vastly better to leave Amer - ican poetry out of his reckoning than to rep - resent it in this meagre and eccentric fashion .

		His own disclaimer concerning '' the hopeless - ness of attempting to do more than cull a flower here and there '' can not be accepted as a sufficient warrant for this extraordinary showing .

		History of Architecture in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		* In all forms of art expression , there is a spirit which lies deeper than the surface ; though in Architecture it is the superficial aspect which appeals foremost , and perhaps finally , to the great majority of observers -- or , better , spec - tators , for one is hardly an observer whose glance does not penetrate beneath the surface .

		In the art of an individual worker , this spirit has a quality almost wholly subjective , and is revealed only to the discerning student of human nature ; so that the study of the individual 's efforts in art is , to a great extent , a study of personality .

		When the individual 's effort is merged in the achievements of the race , the art is a matter for history .

		The personal equation , though not wanting , is generally lost sight of in the broader problem of the race-spirit .

		The history of architecture is the history of the deepest life-passions of the races , which some - times , building '' better than they knew , '' have raised to their memory enduring architectural monuments .

		The lands stretching southward from the Alps and the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	to the borders of the great inland sea hold for us a most vital in - terest ; for over them ran the hordes of the north , that met the civilization of the east and of the south in sustained and bitter con - flict , to the end that the southern and eastern civilizations were swept from the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	and the northern barbarism was tamed and softened and developed into a newer and fuller civilization , in whose monuments are reminiscent the beauty and power of the older * Akchitecture in

		A History of Italian Archi - tecture , from the
Time of Constantine	ORGANIZATION	to the Dawn of the Renaissance .

		By
Charles A. Cummings	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co	ORGANIZATION	, and vanished civilizations .


Spain	LOCATION	is rich in the memories of this conflict ; but it is to
Italy	LOCATION	that we are drawn with the keenest sympathy , for from that land of sunshine vivifying beams of art have penetrated into the great cold heart of the north , and from the heart of that north are we of the
Western World	ORGANIZATION	.

		To behold these monuments , and recognize their superficial beauty , is one thing ; to feel the life-blood of great races rushing through them is another , -- and toward this latter end a sympathetic his - tory will materially help the student .

		Mr.
Charles A. Cummings	PERSON	, an American architect of distinction , has essayed a work of this sort , in his recently published history of Archi - tecture in
Italy	LOCATION	, surveying the field from the time of Constantine to the dawn of the Renais - sance .

		It is a wide field , and the author esti - mates very modestly -- possibly underestimates -- the value of his work , which was undertaken because , although needed and greatly to be de - sired , no similar work exists in English , and works in other languages , though numerous and in some instances extremely full and com - plete , are found to have limitations which im - pair their value to the student .

		To write a history of social and political life , one must of necessity be an historian in the recognized sense of the word ; to write sympathetically a history of architecture , one must of necessity be both an architect and historian , for architecture is an expression of the social and political life of a people in the terms of art .

		Obviously , the combination of architect and historian must be rare , if not quite impossible , in an age of specialization ; but Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	has suc - ceeded in combining the functions in a high degree , and his work is one of great value to the student , as well as of extreme interest to the '' general reader , '' who will follow it with a volume of mediaeval history at hand for side excursions into other than architectural fields .

		Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	regards Christianity as '' the mother of Italian architecture , '' and finds '' its earliest appearance in the catacombs . ''

		From this germ , according to his view , sprang the early basilicas , '' from which were developed the great churches which are still the admira - tion of the world . ''

		The work , until the last chapter is reached , has to do mainly with churches ; for they are the principal monuments remaining to us from the middle ages , and were built for the most part , perhaps , in the spirit and to the glory of the religion of Jesus Christ .

		But many of them were built through 154 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
March 1	DATE	, fear and superstition , and in fulfilment of vows ; for a great marauding band rarely set forth on a predatory expedition without first invoking aid at some great shrine and vowing the erec - tion of a greater shrine should the venture prove successful .

		Often the vows were fulfilled , and frequently at the expense of some beautiful Christian church already existing , which was despoiled of its riches of sculpture and orna - ment for the adornment of the newer edifice .

		All of this in no way diminishes the romance of the tale , but makes difficult the writing of architectural history , and is only an instance of the difficulties with which the historian has to contend .

		After tracing the development of the early Christian church from its germ in the cata - combs , Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	says : '' No essential feature can be cited of the early basilican church , or of the square , circular , or polygonal churches of the first four centuries after Constantine , which had not its prototype in the temples or the civic buildings of the Empire . ''

		These churches and the contemporary buildings in
Italy	LOCATION	'' were in the main the production of the Roman race of builders , and were in the direct line of succession from those of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		And a remarkable fact is then stated , a fact in which is seen the prophecy of the Renaissance , that the Italian race , through all its changes of government and population , has adhered steadfastly to the classic traditions , and has accepted with reluctance and never with hearty support the styles forced upon it from without by Lombard ,
Byzantine	LOCATION	,
Norman	PERSON	, or the
Cis	ORGANIZATION	- tercians bringing the
Gothic of Northern France	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Gothic invasion impaired the chain of Roman builders , the Lombard inva - sion broke it absolutely ; and for six centuries , or till the coming of the Renaissance , the Ro - manesque held sway in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	speaks interestingly and with clearness con - cerning the term Romanesque , and after giving its origin , says : '' The Romanesque , in character as well as in time , lies between the Roman and the Gothic , being in great measure an inheritance from the one , and carrying within itself , at least in most of its forms , the promise of the other .

		Yet Quicherat 's definition as ' an archi - tecture which has ceased to be Roman , though it retains much that is Roman , and has not yet become Gothic , though it has already something of Gothic , ' is , as far as its application to the Romanesque of
Italy	LOCATION	is concerned , certainly faulty , since it implies that all Romanesque is on its way to become Gothic .

		To the Romanesque of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, and to a certain extent that of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	, where the wooden roofs have been superseded by vaulting , where the walls and piers have been made heavy and broad to support it , and where the whole disposition of parts has a more or less organic arrangement , the definition is clearly applicable ; but it would as certainly exclude the
Romanesque of Central	ORGANIZATION	and
Southern Italy	LOCATION	, in which the internal disposition is essentially that of the Roman basilicas , and in which the ornaments and the general exterior design are the features which distinguish the Romanesque church from its Roman prototype . ''

		The lack of homogeneousness in the Ro manesque of
Italy	LOCATION	leads the author to discrim inate between its various geographical aspects and so he gives the name '' Lombard Roman esque '' to that style which developed in
Milan Pavia	LOCATION	, and the Lombard cities of the north of
Italy	LOCATION	, and that of '' Central Romanesque '' to the more classic forms which are found in
Tuscany	LOCATION	and the region between
Tuscany	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	; while that mixed style which grew up contemporaneously over
Apulia	LOCATION	,
Calabria	LOCATION	, and the other provinces of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	-LRB- a style in which the Lombard and the
Norman	PERSON	had perhaps an equal share , and of which the abundant and fascinating ornament is largely due to the Greek sculptors by whom these provinces were overrun from the eighth to the eleventh centuries -RRB- , is appropriately desig - nated by Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	as the '' Southern Romanesque . ''

		The Romanesque in
Italy	LOCATION	dates from the Lombard invasion .

		There has been not a little speculation as to how so rude a race as the Lombard was at the time of the invasion could produce so fine an architecture as the Lombard Romanesque .

		Much , without doubt , was due to the order of the
Masistri Coma	ORGANIZATION	- cini , of which Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	treats with neces - sary fulness , noting the origin of the Coma - cini , according to legend , on a little island in the
Lake of Como	LOCATION	, where an independent
Roman Colony	ORGANIZATION	endured for twenty years after the invasion , yielding finally to the
Lombards	LOCATION	after a protracted siege .

		He then gives an account of the laws of the
Lombards	LOCATION	, which established the order of master builders , `` Mag - istri Comacini , '' from among the already famous builders of the region , regulating its work and fixing a scale of payment .

		The differences between the various phases of the Romanesque , Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	has set down clearly and in a manner full of interest ; but the subject necessarily receives treatment in such great detail as to make epitomizing a difficult task .

		In fact , the same may be said of the other themes which serve to mark the division into chapters .

		The meat of the Ro - man builders is presented with the Roman -

		155 esque , but the wine and juices of the feast come with the Byzantine influence .

		While the eastern builders left in
Italy	LOCATION	no churches of the Byzantine type , the eastern sculptors and colorists left on the Italian buildings of the middle ages the impress of their great love for flowing line , free form , and brilliant color , with the result that from
Venice	LOCATION	to
Palermo	LOCATION	, through
Milan	LOCATION	,
Ravenna	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, the
Byzan	PERSON	- tine ornament in sculpture and mosaic hangs like rich grapes upon the vine .

		Only in con - servative
Rome	LOCATION	, where the classic spirit never was extinguished , is the flavor less sweet .

		The chapter on
Gothic	ORGANIZATION	is of great interest , and is beautiful in its illustrations ; while that on Sicilian Architecture , beginning in romance and warmed throughout by the blood of the south and the east , is equally attractive in matter and in its illustrations .

		The work is very attractive in its make-up , both volumes being especially rich in illustrations , which are well chosen , well executed , and well printed .

		All plans and sections are in line , as are a few of the details ; but the great majority of the details , and all the interior and exterior views , are in half-tone from photographs , many of the subjects 80 unhackneyed yet beautiful as to cause wonder that they are so little known .

		A list of over a hundred authors consulted , and copious foot and marginal notes with refer - ences , add greatly to the value of the work .

		An
Optimistic View of Human Rights	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The problems that now confront our Amer - ican democracy call for renewed discussion of the basis of government .

		The fundamental questions of man 's relation to the
State	ORGANIZATION	and of the
State	ORGANIZATION	's obligation to the individual are yet matters of dispute , and on the way in which they are to be answered will depend the solu - tion of much that is of vital moment in present - day politics .

		Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	, in his dis - cussion of `` The Rights of Man , '' takes up first '' The Conflict of the Centuries , '' founding the general development of his argument on the thesis that the advance of society has been away from the autocratic idea of government • The Rights op Man .

		By
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		as exemplified by
Rome	LOCATION	, toward the democratic form as understood by the Hebrews .

		Following this are chapters on political , industrial , edu - cational , and religious rights , in the discussion of all of which it is maintained that no man has any inherent right to impose government of any sort upon another man , whether as king or as member of a democracy , save only as by such government greater protection in his rights is secured to the individual .

		Politically , then , man has a right to personal security , and only by the possession of an enlightened conscience a right to share in government . ''

		The first industrial duty of society is to protect every man in his right to labor and in his ownership of the fruits of his labor . ''

		This is defined as an absolute right ; artificial rights , such as the right to land , are those established by society , and our present industrial system is unjust because it `` is based upon the private owner - ship of common wealth . ''

		Taxation as now managed is also unjust , since it does not fall most heavily upon those whose rights are most in need of protection from government .

		As a remedy for these evils .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	gives a very lucid presentation of the Single Tax theory .

		Educationally , man has a right to `` the devel - opment of his own , true , ideal , divine person - ality '' ; and religiously , '' It is the right of man to pursue this quest -LSB- the quest for God -RSB- unhindered ; to find God for himself , in his own way , with his own faculties , after his own fashion . ''

		Having shown that a democracy is not by inherent right any more a just government than an oligarchy , he goes on to the conclusion that democracy is the best government because it more fully than any other provides for the intellectual and moral development of the people .

		He understands the '' distinguishing characteristic of the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	as one embodying the spirit of faith in man , hope for man , and good-will toward men . ''

		The result of this with us he sees as a large balance on the side of good in our religious , political , social , and industrial life .

		More than this .

		Dr. Ab - bott finds good reason for believing that democ - racy is to reconstruct society , coming to the time when it shall embody these five principles : 1 , the diffusion of happiness ; 2 , through the development of character ; 3 , by a process of gradual growth ; 4 , the secret thereof being the indwelling of God in humanity ; 6 , the end thereof being a brotherhood of man cen - tred in God as the Universal Father . ''

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	takes notice of many domestic 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, problems , many foreign problems , many perils .

		The Indian , the negro , the political machine , the boss , the plutocrat , imperialism , and the democratic spirit , -- all these are discussed in the light of the general principles which have been carefully worked out in the preceding pages .

		The concluding paragraph of the book sums up its conclusions briefly : `` The conflict of the centuries is one between the doctrine of pagan imperialism , that life and the world are made for the few , whom the many are to serve ; and that of the Hebraic democracy , that life and the world are made for the many , and the great are to be their servants .

		This democratic or Hebraic or
Chris	PERSON	- tian doctrine involves : in politics .

		All just government is for the benefit of the governed ; in political economy .

		The common wealth is for the benefit of the common people ; in education , A fair opportunity for the devel - opment of every individual ; in religion .

		The right of every soul to learn for itself what it can of the Infinite , and to tell what it thinks it has learned .

		Of the He - braic democracy the
United States	LOCATION	affords the best modern example ; in the faithful application of these simple principles it will find the solution of its prob - lems , both domestic and foreign .

		Its perils are great , but the grounds for hopefulness as to the final issue are greater .

		That issue , if it be successfully achieved , in - volves the material welfare of all the people , based on their intellectual and spiritual development ; the free - dom of the community , based on the recognition of a divine law enforced by reason and conscience ; and a brotherhood of humanity , based on loyalty to one Father and manifested in glad service rendered by his sons as freemen to one another . ''

		As here expressed , these conclusions are little more than hopeful sentiments ; but they have been reached through a course of very patient reasoning , -- reasoning illumined by the glow of a most contagious enthusiasm .

		The premise of the first chapter , that
Koman	PERSON	and Hebrew political thinking were opposed as autocratic and democratic , may easily be disputed .

		But the validity of the argument does not depend upon the truth of this .


Nei	ORGANIZATION	- ther does it greatly matter what has given us the growing sense of human brotherhood , -- the thought of the fatherhood of God , as Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	thinks , or a clearer recognition of our mutual interdependence .

		We may pass by these and some other personal elements in the discussion as being interesting , but not con - vincing , and there is still left a substantial body of thoughtful comment on the course of human development and present conditions .

		Students of social problems and the general reader should alike be grateful for so reason - able and stimulating a discussion of matters of such moment , even if in its genial optimism they are not at all times able to share .

Doris	PERSON	, an old flame now widowed , on the steamer bound for the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	; in the third chapter ,
Vernon Blake	PERSON	joins
Doris	PERSON	at
Gibraltar	LOCATION	; in the intervening chapters ,
Blake	PERSON	makes love to
Doris	PERSON	and the nar - rator to her mother ; in the last chapter there is , as Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	phrases it , '' a quatrain of destiny . ''

		Making love over parts of three continents must be very good fun , and Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	sees to it that no chance is omitted to supply sound information -- somewhat Baedekerish at times , but often original in its conclusions , as in the estimate made of Gen - eral Gordon while in the Soudan : '' His bravery , his conscientious sense of duty to the gar - risons he had taken over , and his fidelity unto death to the Arabs who stood by him , is -LSB- sic -RSB- beyond question .

		His size was that of a regimental , or brigade , commander .

		He was not equal to the government of a province .

		His Chinese rec - ord as a commander who struck promptly and with awe - inspiring severity , was nullified by his year 's shilly-shallying at Khartum .

		As I stood on the top of the
Serail	LOCATION	, -- where he had stood so often during those long and agonizing months of suspense , -- and gazed over the surrounding country for miles , I could only marvel that
Gordon	PERSON	had held out against the
Mahdi	PERSON	as long as he had .

		The possibilities of defending the promontory from artillery-fire are meagre .

		I understood perfectly what Lord
Milner	PERSON	meant by describing the imprac - ticable Arab chieftain .

		Wad el
Nejumi	LOCATION	, who tried to lead an army across the Nubian desert into
Egypt	LOCATION	, as ' the Gordon of Mahdiism . ' ''

		There are numerous reproduced photographs to add to the desirability of the book ; and it may be freely admitted that Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	's experiment of writing a book of travel with an abundance of '' heart in - terest '' is successful .

		It is difficult to extract anything new from a voyage in a dahabSah up the Nile , but '' Our
House	ORGANIZATION	- boat on the Nile '' is not without interest , if lacking in originality .

		Mrs.
Lee Bacon	PERSON	tells the story , and her husband , Mr.
Henry Bacon	PERSON	, furnishes a number of delicate drawings for illustrations , the frontis - piece in color being exceptionally beautiful .

		It shows the wonderful fagade of the temple at
Abou Sembel	ORGANIZATION	, with its repeated statue-portraits of Ra - meses II. , described by Mrs.
Bacon	PERSON	thus : '' The hand of time has touched the facade of the temple sufficiently to add to its beauty rather than detract from it .

		Instead of four colossal seated figures , as the children would say , ' pin for pin alike , ' with four heads wearing crowns , eight legs , and ever so many fingers and toes in exact rows , the end of the nineteenth century sees one figure broken away down to the waist , three out of the four crowns gone , one set of legs crumbled away ; a most picturesque ensemble .

		The proportions , the architecture , and the sculpture are what at first hold one spellbound ; later the beauty of the faces , the generosity of the great six-feet-wide mouths , kind , calm , benign .

		The crown lies broken at the feet of the figure , which is itself broken away .

		Why is it that the three re - maining figures are more beautiful than four could ever have been ?

		Why is the number three as subtly beautiful in ar - chitecture as it is fraught with grace in music ? ' '

		This extract will give a better idea of the real charm in the book than much description .

		A simple , cultivated style , a keen sense of the humor - ous , and great kindliness of heart , make the narra - tive exceptionally readable .

		Under the guise of letters from a brother to a sister , Miss
Norma Lorimer	PERSON	writes * ' By the Waters of

March 1	DATE	,
Syracuse	LOCATION	, and the rest divided between
Castrogio	PERSON	- vanni , the centre of the sulphur trade , and the cap - ital of the island province ,
Palermo	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of this storied soil is told with sympathy and vivacity , as may be seen in an extract from the description of the
Capella Palatina	LOCATION	at
Palermo	ORGANIZATION	, built by
Roger II	PERSON	.

		in
1132	DATE	, as follows : '' If I told you that the beauty of the famous Easter can - dlestick , ivhich stands fourteen feet high and came from
Constantinople	LOCATION	, although it was carved by Norman workmen , almost brought tears to my eyes , you would say that I had been reading
Kuskin	PERSON	, and undermining my constitution by a prolonged diet of slaughtered kid ; and I wonder what idea you would carry away of the marble pulpit if I were fool enough to tell you the truth : that it is one of the pulpits built by those earnest men of long ago , who thought that no stone was too rare or priceless , no time too long , no money too much to devote to the beautifying of a throne from which the word of God was to be preached .

		These mediaeval artists seem to me to have been men sent by God to beautify His sanctuaries on earth .

		They were divinely inspired for divine art .

		The chapel is small , and it is so full of such priceless marbles that I should not have been surprised if it had been guarded night and day by a piquet of soldiers , for if such a glorious thing as the priceless Easter candlestick was ever mutilated and carried off , the jewel of
Sicily	LOCATION	would be despoiled . ''

		There is a colored frontispiece after a painting by Miss
Margaret Thomas	PERSON	, with several other excel - lent illustrations from photographs .

		At the close of the story a pleasant bit of romance is woven in for good measure , adding greatly to the charm of the book .

		Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	evidently enjoyed his '' Win - ter Pilgrimage , '' the only drawbacks to complete happiness being the mistakes which the foreigners insisted upon making from time to time , -- exactly the sort of thing an American complains of in En - gland , for example .

		The book is readable , but it owes a great deal of its best thought and matter to the inspiration of
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		The following obser - vation , made in
Cyprus	LOCATION	, is more original : ``
Nicosia	LOCATION	is a place of many amusements .

		Thus , they play golf there on a course of nine holes .

		It is odd to do the round with a gentleman in a fez acting as your caddie , and to observe upon the greens -- or the yellows , for they are made of sand -- Turkish ladies veiled in yashmaks engaged in the useful tasks of brushing and weeding .

		What in their secret hearts do the denizens of the harem think of us , I wonder ?

		Would not their verdict , if we could get at it , be ' Mad , mad , my masters ' ?

		But English folk would celebrate book-teas and play golf or any other accustomed game upon the brink of Styx .

		Perhaps that is why they remain a ruling race . ''

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	went from
Italy	LOCATION	to
Cyprus	LOCATION	, and thence to Palestine .

		He was an observant , if insular trav - eller , and decidedly skeptical regarding the authen - ticity of holy places and relics .

		But he avers , in closing , that he bad a good time ; and the reflection of it is in these pages , plentifully illustrated , as usual , with reproduced photographs .

		That excellent book of Miss
Ella C. Sykes	PERSON	's , '' Through
Persia	LOCATION	on a Side-Saddle , '' has been re - vised and republished , with a new introduction by Major-General Sir
Frederic Goldsmid	PERSON	,
C.B.	LOCATION	, K.C.S.I. , in which there will be found an explana - tion of one of the border disputes in which
Persia	LOCATION	is interested and strong commendation of the work of
Miss Sykes	LOCATION	as accurate .

		The revision of the text appears to have been limited to minor matters , and di # Eer8 in no essential way from that of the first edition several years ago .

		Miss
Sykes	PERSON	's journey through the East was completed in
1896	DATE	, and events have been marching with singular rapidity for the Orient ever since ; but of the extension of Russian influence in the
Shah	PERSON	's dominions , no account is taken here .

		The maps and pictures of the earlier edition suffer no change ; but the book loses noth - ing of human interest , except in a political sense , through the years which have elapsed . ''

		On the Great Highway , '' by Mr.
James C. Creelman	PERSON	, is something more than a mere book of travel , though its author fairly journeys around the world in its pages .

		But as a special correspondent for one or another
New York	LOCATION	newspaper , his vari - ous expeditions were undertaken only when im - portant news was forthcoming , and his presence in the various kingdoms and principalities he mentions was usually of a stormy-petrel character .

		The only newspaper man to be accorded an interview with the Pontiff of the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	, he rightly places his account of that event at the opening of his narrative , following it with the establishment of another record in the interview he had with the
King of Corea	ORGANIZATION	.

		The war between
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	for the mastery of
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	is followed from
Corea	LOCATION	to the mainland ; and the battle of Port
Arthur	PERSON	, with the massacre which followed , is de - scribed with vivid effect .

		Thence there is a swift passage to
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and an extended interview had with that apostle of peace .

		The book is one of quick transitions and strong contrasts , the next figure being that of General
Weyler	PERSON	, '' The Butcher , '' as Mr.
Creelman	PERSON	calls him , whose wreath of poison ivy some of the American generals in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines seem trying to wrest from his brow .

		An interesting chapter on '' yellow journalism '' follows , with this justification , unfortunate in its opening sentences , but none the less significant : '' If the war against
Spain	LOCATION	is justified in the eyes of his - tory , then ' yellow journalism ' deserves its place among the most useful instrumentalities of civilization .

		It may be guilty of giving the world a lop-sided view of events by ex - aggerating the importance of a few things and ignoring others , it may offend the eye by typographical violence ; it may sometimes proclaim its own deeds too loudly ; but it has never deserted the cause of the poor and the downtrodden ; it has never taken bribes , -- and that is more than can be said of its most conspicuous critics . ''

		Some part of this estimate may be applied to Mr.
Creelman	PERSON	's own work .

		He is evidently not of a retiring disposition , -- else his occupation would be gone .

		But he is interesting , whether talking about others , or , more frequently , about himself .

		The book is illustrated with portraits of many of the persons mentioned , reproduced from photographs .

		J THE DIAL 159 as the lawyers say ; but it is her experience in crossing
Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	on the great Russian railway line that gives title to her book , '' A Ribbon of Iron . ''

		Miss
Meakin	PERSON	left the British metropolis
March 18 , 1900	DATE	, and returned to that spot
August 31	DATE	, having spanned the whole round world in that space of five months and thirteen days , without haste or hardship .

		She was in
Blagovestchensk	LOCATION	on
June 28	DATE	, only four days before the firing of the shot which led to the most dreadful of modern massacres .

		While in the city she was told by the manager of the hotel that war between
Russia	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	was imminent . ''

		There seem to be as many
Chinamen	LOCATION	as Russians in this town , '' she remarked ; `` What will happen to them if there is a war ? '' ''

		The moment war is declared they will all have to leave , '' he replied , '' every one of them . ''

		And so it proved ; but their souls left , not their bodies .

		The neighboring city of
Aigun	LOCATION	, inhabited chiefly by Chinese , was wiped off the earth .

		Our author bought a photograph of a local dignitary , of which she remarks : '' As we were steaming down the Amur , I took the photo - graph and wrote on the back , ' Governor of
Aigun	LOCATION	, Chinese town on the Amur . '

		`` To-day there is no Aigun , and no Governor ! ''

		The story is a simple one , conveying successfully the freshness of the youthful author 's impressions ; and it is well illustrated .

		The interest taken in
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, through the death , in
October , 1901	DATE	, of the
Amir Abdurrah	PERSON	- man , and the enthronement of his son
Habibullah	PERSON	in his stead , has led to a republication of Doctor
John Alfred Gray	PERSON	's intensely interesting volume entitled '' At the Court of the Amir , '' first given the reading world in
1895	DATE	, narrating his extended sojourn in that troubled land as a physician at - tached to the native court .

		A new preface has been written for this edition , in which the recent change of rulers is dwelt upon briefly ; but the in - trinsic merit of the narrative loses nothing by the lapse of time , and the book may be read for the actual fascination in its pages .

		Doctor Gray was in
Kabul	LOCATION	many months before the great
Amir	PERSON	's health was entrusted to his skill , the royal patron - age being withdrawn soon after through the machi - nations of a designing and worthless Hindoo .

		When illness attacked the monarch again , the Englishman saw that he should not be called in until the native Hakim , or physicians , had brought the Amir almost to the point of death , and that the blame for
Abdurrahman	ORGANIZATION	's death , which would be likely to follow as a matter of course , would be laid at his door .

		He therefore resigned his some - what thankless position , after a residence in Afghan - istan from
March , 1889	DATE	, to
May , 1892	DATE	, interrupted by a vacation of eight months in
England	LOCATION	.

		Of the last Amir a most fascinating portrait is painted , leaving no doubt of the man 's inherent nobility and power .

		Not much is said of the new ruler , but of his father this anecdote is told : '' His Highness had heard that I was ill , and I told him I had not with me the medicine I wished to take .

		His High - ness asked .

		Would I take native medicine if he prescribed it ?

		I said I should be most grateful to His Highness if he would honor me so far .

		His Highness gave some directions to a
Hakim	PERSON	, who presently brought a small jar .

		With a little silver spoon he took some dark-looking confection out of the jar , made a bolus of it , and gave it to me .

		It tasted hot and very nice .

		There was no more in the pot , and he sent the
Hakim	PERSON	away to make some fresh .

		It was then that my mind became troubled in me , for I knew the
Hakim	PERSON	loved me not . ''

		Presently the jar was brought back , and as they were about to give it me .

		His Highness asked for it .

		He scooped a little out with a spoon , and was raising it to his lips , when the
Hakim	PERSON	stopped him and whispered in his ear .

		The Amir turned and looked at hira , and the
Hakim	PERSON	hurried away with a very red face .

		By-and-bye he returned with the jar .

		Again the Amir took it , and looking at me , he raised a spoon - ful to his lips and swallowed it ... To appreciate fully the honor he did me , one must be conversant with Oriental customs .

		To taste a medicine before handing it to the pa - tient is the duty of an Oriental physician when he is attend - ing the
King	LOCATION	.

		I was a servant -- but also a stranger and a guest -- and the Amir treated me as though I had been a Prince . ''

		Doctor Gray was also a painter in oils , and a pho - togravure from the portrait he made of the late Amir serves as a frontispiece here .

		Mrs.
Fanny Bullock Workman	PERSON	and Doctor
William Hunter Workman	PERSON	, to follow the order of the names on the title-page of their interesting ac - count of mountain climbing and exploration '' In the Ice World of Himalaya , '' succeeded in con - quering several peaks of the great Asiatic range which had never known the foot of man before .

		These are in the Skoro La circle , and were ap - proached from the
Shigar Valley	LOCATION	during the sum - mer of
1899	DATE	;
Zurbriggen	PERSON	, a noted Swiss guide , being in the party .

		The most notable ascent is described as follows : '' We reached the top , 19,450 feet , at ten o'clock , four hours from camp , which time in no way represents the diffi - culties of the ascent , which began at Avalanche Camp , seven to eight hours below ... Speaking from the point of view of ordinary Alpinists , whose knowledge is born of expe - rience with many of the best known mountains of
Switzer	PERSON	- land ,
Tyrol	LOCATION	, the
Dolomites	LOCATION	, and some of the numerous untrodden ones of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, we should say , unless the climbers are experts , this is not a mountain to be attempted without a competent guide . ''

		We ate our breakfast with good appetites , and , except for some headache and loss of breath on sudden exertion , suffered in no way from the altitude ... We named the peak Mt.
Bullock Workman	PERSON	, and left our cards , with name given and record of ascent , in a glass jar , in the snow at the highest point .

		The temperature at ten o'clock was 56 Fahr. , about the same as on the Siegfriedhorn . ''

		Numerous descriptions of native life separate the accounts of the several mountains ascended , and there are numerous photographs in half-tone repro - duction .

		There is a map and a glossary of native words , but no index .

		Mr.
William Carey	PERSON	has gathered together such facts as have been well authenticated by way of introduction to `` Adventures in
Tibet	LOCATION	, '' the only new matter in the handsome volume being the transcriptions from the diary of Miss
Annie R. Taylor	PERSON	, who succeeded in wandering into
Tibet	LOCATION	by one route and out by another during the years 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1 , 1892-3	DATE	in a manner nothing less than remarkable .

		Her account of her own journey , written in pencil in a note-book day by day during her travels , has the merit of being entirely unadorned , though seri - ously injured through her lack of comparative knowledge , -- in fact , missionary zeal led her into undertaking a task nothing less than preposterous , and she seems to have accepted hardship with the resignation of the early Christian martyrs .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	left the Chinese frontier city of Tau-Chau
September 2 , 1892	DATE	, by stealth , and promptly ran into a nest of brigands .

		Her escort of five men dwindled to one , and all the pack-horses died ; but such reflections as '' I am God 's little woman , and He will take care of me , '' sustained her until she was within three days ' journey of
Lhassa	LOCATION	, the cap - ital city .

		Here she was arrested and held for fif - teen days , during which she was continually fighting for her own life and the lives of the two servants with her , being unarmed , and without food , except as her captors provided her .

		In her darkest mo - ments , with her life lawfully forfeit to her judges , she calmly wrote , '' Quite safe here with Jesus , '' -- and the sequel justified her faith .

		She was turned back , it is true , but not until her captors had re - turned to her all her confiscated property , together with '' a tent , horses , and provisions sufficient for the return to
China	LOCATION	. ''

		She reached Ta-Chien-Lu
April 13 , 1893	DATE	, the months she passed in
Tibet	LOCATION	being the least endurable of the year .

		Her own narrative , though made readable and consecutive by Mr.
Carey	PERSON	's careful editing , is not as interesting as his summary of it , and has no scientific value , though she traversed , in part , territory quite un - known to Europeans .

		There are a few photo - graphs and several rough drawings by
Miss Taylor	PERSON	herself , by way of illustrations .

		Mr.
E. H. Parker	PERSON	's ''
John Chinaman	PERSON	and a Few Others '' is a book of many delights .

		Its theme , as far as it has one , is the demonstration of the humanity , even from the Anglo-Saxon point of view , of the Chinese of all sorts and conditions .

		A keen sense of humor , a quick sympathy , a complete grasp of the universality of man 's shortcomings , and a ready pen , make this a book from which no one can arise without refreshment , both mental and spiritual .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	was consul at various places in the
Orient	LOCATION	, and his life has been devoted to the service of the British Crown ; but the book will be laid down with the feeling that he would have made a notable missionary in the usual sense of the word ; no one better calculated to give the
China	LOCATION	- man a decent idea of the European can be imag - agined .

		There is not a trace of the tendency to contrast a Chinese mob with a fashionable
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean church congregation , nor to expect rather more of a Chinese servant than from a European ambassador ; nor is there , on the other hand , any attempt to set the better sort of Chinese on a ped - estal as an example for the worse sort of European to profit by .

		Having lived in
China	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	long enough to learn that the majority of the hu - man race there is full as manly , as womanly , and as childlike as the minority which chances to be born in
Europe	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, he takes it for granted that his readers are quite as familiar as he with this self-evident truth , and proceeds to share the joys and sorrows through which he passed while among the yellow-skinned people with his fellow - whites .

		The book is composed of incidents ar - ranged under minor headings into chapters , but is altogether informal in arrangement as in style .

		It is anecdotical to a degree , and the anecdotes are new .

		All are worth reading , but to Americans this is perhaps the best : '' No foreigner haa ever yet succeeded in obtaining a Chi - nese degree , nor is it at all likely that any one has tried ; but as special arrangements are made for Miao-tsz -LSB- a sort of gipsy -RSB- and other tribes , it is not improbable that a European student would be admitted if he went through the usual cur - riculum .

		On the other hand , both Chinese and Japanese have shown that they possess the requisite mental capacity to obtain English degrees , and to pass the Inns of Court ex - aminations for call to the bar .

		When it is considered that , in order to do this , the Oriental must have some knowledge of Roman as well as of English history , it becomes evident that , besides mastering Law , a Chinese who can pass for call must possess considerable intellectual power .

		`` One of the students at the
Middle Temple	ORGANIZATION	in
1876	DATE	was Ng Choy -LRB- the Cantonese way of pronouncing Wu Ts ` ai -RRB- .

		The Wu family of
Canton	LOCATION	, to which it is almost certain Mr.
Wu	PERSON	must be more or less distantly related , is no other than the '
Howqua	PERSON	' of old Co-hone days ; and I suppose '
Howqua	PERSON	' may be a Portuguese attempt to render the syllables Ng-ka , or ' Wu family . '

		Archdeacon Gray several times took me to see the family mansion .

		Mr.
Ng	PERSON	, after being called to the bar , returned to
Hongkong	LOCATION	, where he practised for a time before
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	there .

		Before long his services were requisitioned by Li Hung-chang at
Tientsin	LOCATION	, where he remained for many years as legal adviser , and thus obtained formal entrance into the Chinese public service .

		He is no other than Wu T'ing - fang , the present able Minister at
Washington	LOCATION	... When a Chinese becomes a mandarin , he adopts an official ' Christian ' name , and T'ing - fang or ` hall fragrance , ' is accordingly the bureaucratic designa - tion of Ng Choy ; the idea is that of a statesman , the sweet - smelling savor of whose reputation ' fills the court . ' ''

		The pictures in Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's eminently readable book are of the same nature as the text : seen through his eyes , the most obtuse observer can as - sure himself that there are at least as many kinds of Chinaman , good , bad and indifferent , as there are of Caucasians .

		How could it be otherwise , when those who compose it are none other than the foremost figures of that most fascinating time ?

		THE DIAL 161 gouleme .

		It is not the author 's purpose to give anything like a full and connected picture of the Renaissance in
France	LOCATION	, but only to illumine '' a little corner of it '' principally contained within the limits of the reign of
Francis	PERSON	I. ; and even within this portion not to follow closely the movement of ideas or events , nor to penetrate their inner con - nections , but only to '' recall a few of the less known figures '' of that day .

		This modest purpose has been achieved with reasonable success .

		We have accordingly not a historical or critical study , but a little gallery of portraits , most of them sketches rather than finished paintings , done with an alert pen and with a just perception of the salient features .

		In the foreground beside
Marga	LOCATION	- ret are her mother ,
Louise de Savoie	PERSON	, her daughter ,
Jeanne d'Albret	PERSON	, and her brother ,
Francis I.	PERSON	; and about her come and go the men and women , scholars , artists , poets , beauties , wits , who made the epoch , --

		Indeed , 80 many and so various are the figures that hasten across the field of vision that the effect is a little kaleidoscopic .

		Some preliminary chapters furnish a background by setting forth the general condi - tions of the society of the Renaissance , the main current of its ideas , and its historical connection with the past .

		It is perhaps inseparable from the plan of the book , perhaps also in a measure due to the character of the period , that the general impression it leaves is somewhat confused , fragmen - tary , and disconnected .

		But there is much infor - mation in the book , and it may be read with pleas - ure and profit by any who seek an agreeable introduction to the first half of the sixteenth cen - tury in
France	LOCATION	.

		The serious student will go at once to the sources from which it has been drawn .

		The mechanical execution of the book is excellent , and its attractive pages are freer from misprints than is often the case with books containing so many foreign names and quotations .

		There are , however , a few rather irritating ones , -- for in - stance , Causeries de lundi -LRB- p. 226 -RRB- .

		And one wonders whether the long-suffering '' proof-reader '' could be justly held responsible for making the title of du

		^ `` `` '' entertaining writer upon popu - lar themes in astronomy , and his latest work , '' Other Worlds '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- will add to his reputation as a trustworthy popularizer of one of the most abstruse of the sciences .

		His aim , in the book before us , is to present an account of the planets of the solar system from the standpoint of their habitability .

		While freely admitting that intelligence may exist in worlds which are quite unfit for human habitation , Mr.
Serviss	PERSON	refuses to be drawn aside into fruitless speculations on such matters , and confines himself to the simple question whether our planets are at present suited to the support of such life as exists upon the earth .

		One by one , from coy Mercury to slow-footed
Neptune	LOCATION	, the major planets are passed in review , and the latest and most authoritative observations of the appearances and physical conditions of these bodies are discussed in a fair-minded judicial fashion .

		The asteroids and the satellites of the planets are also considered ; an entire chapter is devoted to an admirable description of conditions at the surface of our moon .

		Flights of fancy are not wanting , but they are founded upon fairly well established facts , and add to the charm of the writer 's treat - ment of the subject .

		Even professional astrono - mers , who usually have scant patience with specu - lations concerning the habitability of other worlds , will find little to criticise , even when the author touches upon such a theme as the possibility of aereal navigation upon Venus .

		Occasionally full credence is given to supposed discoveries which have not yet been verified ; an instance of this is found on page 195 , where the ninth satellite of Sat - urn is mentioned .

		The concluding chapter con - tains six charts showing the chief stars of the zodiacal constellations ; these are to be used in connection with the
Nautical Almanac	ORGANIZATION	or some other source of information with reference to the apparent positions of the planets in the heavens .

		Thus the reader may acquaint himself with them , and watch their wanderings in starry fields .

		How trite , yet how true , are his obser - vations on the hideous designs of much of our wall - paper ; and what responsive chords he touches in alluding to its effect upon us in hours of sickness when we are condemned to lie with eyes riveted upon its floral monstrosities and its absurdly im - possible foliage !

		And yet , to do him justice , he is occasionally thought-provoking , and even instruc - tive . ''

		The choice of colours for our rooms , '' he says , '' demands the greatest care .

		Red , without affecting men as it affects bulls , stimulates them to energetic action , or at least to movement , to such an extent that in
Germany	LOCATION	red has been employed in certain factories as a filip to activity ! ''

		In his philosophy of life he finds love to be the all-important thing . ''

		We must love something , but what ? ''

		he asks ; and then , like the true Frenchman that he is , sends us to woman to round out and complete our lives .

		Indeed , as might have been expected from the author of that subtle study in feminism , 162 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The story of the rocks is one in which the leaves are turned but slowly , and , like the palimpsest , the writing must often be restored before the untrained reader can scan the tale .

		It is the dragon chapter which Professor
H. G. Seeley	PERSON	has given us in his `` Dragons of the Air '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , an account of extinct flying reptiles .

		The author is the authority upon Pterodactyles , and gave to the public the re - sults of his many years of investigation in a series of lectures now presented in book form .

		The work is in the main technical , intended for the palaeon - tologist , though the broader phases of the subject are not neglected .

		Thus the habits and affinities of these ancestral forms are discussed and the prin - ciples of palseontological interpretation are eluci - dated .

		-- Of a more popular vein is '' Animals of the Past '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from the pen of Mr.
F. A. Lucas	PERSON	, one of the curators of the
United States National Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		His connection with this public institution has given the author an excellent opportunity to find out the lives of public interest in palaeontology , and his book answers many ques - tions concerning fossils , their methods of forma - tion , their affinities and their meaning .

		Popular misconceptions , such as fossil men and living mam - moths , are explained , and an effort is made to give the real facts concerning the size and nature of ex - tinct monsters .

		The illustrations in this book are noteworthy -- since they combine the scientific im - agination of the author and the artistic skill of Mr.
Charles R. Knight	PERSON	.

		The author 's style is free and easy , and he has furnished a very readable book .

		Each chapter closes with a few references to pertinent literature of reliable character , and the museums are noted in which the best examples of the animals described may be seen .

		HfeofVietoHa ,
The Marquis of Lome	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now His hy one of her Grace the
Duke of Argyll	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was a axon family .

		^ ^ ^ ^ appropriate person to be selected to write a life of the late Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		A son - in-law of the great queen , he was familiar with her home-life -- one of the best indexes of character in any person . ''


V. R. I. Queen Victoria	PERSON	, her Life and Empire '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a well-written , eminently readable biography .

		It traces the great queen from her early days , through her whole long career , to her demise ; devoting by far the larger part of the book to her life anterior to the death of the Prince Consort in
1861	DATE	.

		The author handles his material with wisdom and a due sense of proportion , though the reader would often be greatly delighted if he could obtain a little fuller picture of political affairs as seen from the palace .

		Of course , the picture as given is mainly that seen and painted by the royalty , but its dimness is often a source of disappointment .

		After the death of
Prince Albert	PERSON	, Queen
Victoria	PERSON	showed the hardiest heroism .

		The affairs of state , as the years grew on , became more and more com - plicated .

		The events on the European continent and in
Asia	LOCATION	, between the seventies and eighties , among
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and the
East	LOCATION	, added greatly to her burdens of state .

		But she was brave , heroic , and full of faith .

		Her voice was ever against war , and for everything that made for peace .

		The last years of the Queen were full of pathos , well described in this volume , and affec - tionately appropriate .

		The study of Professor
Charles R. Henderson	PERSON	's dependent and '' Introduction to the Study of the delinquent classes .

		Dependent , Delinquent , and
Defec	PERSON	- tive Classes , and of their Social Treatment '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- provides material that should awaken the interest of intelligent philanthropy , and undertakes '' to aid educated social leaders to enter upon a method of study which will conduct them to codi - fied results of wide experience and investigation , so that they may think more effectively , observe more shrewdly , and cooperate in the wisest methods of action . ''

		Naturally , such a book must have more than a passing interest for every thoughtful per - son who concerns himself about the welfare of his less fortunate fellow-men .

		The book is intended , primarily , as a text-book for colleges and univer - sities ; but its scope and purpose are much wider .

		The author has divided his work into four parts , -- '' The Phenomena of Dependence and their Expla - nation , '' '' Social Organization for the Relief and
Care of Dependents	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Social Arrangements for the Education , Relief , Care , and Custody of De - fectives , '' and '' An Introduction to Criminal Soci - ology . ''

		An appendix gives valuable suggestions to the student , indicates what authorities can be consulted if further investigations are desired , gives brief summaries of measurements , several valuable tables , and copious references in support of the text .

		The questions discussed show mature judg - ment , painstaking investigations , careful study of the best literature of the time , and a happy faculty of presenting ideas and conclusions succinctly and yet in a manner likely to provoke further inves - tigation on the part of the inquiring mind .

		In the opening of his compact biog - m ` of ^ ^ T ^ '' ^ * P ^ y ^ ^
Washington Irving	LOCATION	in the Riverside Biographical Series -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Henry W. Boynton	PERSON	tells us that Irving 's '' original publishers are now selling , year by year , more of his books than ever before . ''

		This is interesting as a bit of literary statistics ; but when , interpreting for us , he adds , '' There is little doubt that his work is still widely read , and read not because it is prescribed , but because it gives pleasure ; not as the product of a ' standard author , ' but as the expression of a rich and engag - ing personality , which has written itself like an
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 168 endorsement across the face of a young nation 's literature , '' there will doubtless be many to raise dis - senting voice .

		By Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	's own showing , the larger body of Irving 's work is , if not exactly me - chanical , at least lacking in the fire of genius .

		He also makes it clear that , while
Irving	PERSON	was not quite a dilletante in his attitude toward literature and life , his inspiration was rather that of sentiment than passion .

		We need not insist too much on the strenuous life to make it apparent that the impress of such a personality through its own immediate power is not likely to be great upon the reading world to-day .

		For the purposes of this brief biog - raphy , however , it is well that the author thinks otherwise .

		His enthusiasm for his subject , the easy fluency of his style , his nice sense of proportion , make the book a very pleasant volume for a winter evening by the fire .

		As ^ biography , it is perhaps better reading than
Irving	PERSON	's own life of Washing - ton , and the reader may have more assurance of his author 's accuracy .

		Oarden-making on wallt and water .

		If we were not over-civilized , it is not likely we should yearn for such an admixture of nature and art as is implied in Miss
Gertrude Jekyll	PERSON	's '' Wall and Water Gardens '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		It is one of several score of recent works of its kind , and shows that the subject has become one for specialization in limiting itself to the consideration of '' simple ways of using some of the many beautiful mountain plants and the plants of marsh and water . ''

		As in most works on horticulture , it is written by an amateur for amateurs , and has in consequence a literary flavor throughout the text , the bolus of in - struction being made palatable thereby .

		The walls referred to are not necessarily those of houses ; many of them , in fact , are what are called `` fences '' in
New England	LOCATION	, and most of them are erected in spots that need that sort of beautification .

		Nor are the waters spoken of necessarily natural streams ; small ponds and pools , tubs even , will suffice for implanting aquatic plants and lending variety to the scene .

		There is due recognition of the formal gardening that is coming into fashion once more , and the book is both thorough and sin - cere without being technical .

		It is embellished with many half-tone reproductions of photographs , and will be treasured by the amateur gardeners and nature-lovers for whom it is designed .

		The priestly Advanced students of the Bible are element in the differentiating the various elements Old Testament .

		^ f jjg literature , its religion , and its philosophy , so that thereby they may be the better prepared to appreciate the development of the nation in the midst of which these different ideas grew up . ''

		The Priestly Element in the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by President
W. R. Harper	PERSON	, is a series of constructive studies for advanced Bible classes .

		It is essentially a student 's book , analyzed for elaborate work with copious references to scripture texts , and many solid pages of references to English , German , French , and other literature on the themes under discussion .

		These scripture and outside references are ample for the most ambitious student of this theme .

		Fart I. deals with the general scope of the priestly element ; Part II .

		with the history of worship in the earlier , middle , and later Old Testament periods -- accord - ing to the arrangement of the history on the modern evolutionary hypothesis .

		Part III .

		is a compara - tive study of the laws and usages of worship .

		These pertain to the priest , the place of worship , sacrifice , feasts , the Sabbath and kindred institutions , clean and unclean , and prayer and related forms of wor - ship .

		The book is not intended for , neither will it prove to be , interesting reading .

		It is first and last an outline , such as can be most profitably used by students in investigative work .

		Rtuhin ' g Foremost among the men who have principle * of contributed toward the two coOrdin - art-cnitcism .

		^ ^ .

		g movements that are destined to make the twentieth century illustrious was
John Buskin	PERSON	.

		A social reformer as well as an art critic , he stood chief among those who have insisted upon the incorporation of Christian principles into ordi - nary business relations , and upon the application of art to common life .

		The principles of these reforms have so saturated society that they are now accepted by many persons who have never read
Ruskin	PERSON	's books , and who would be dismayed in contemplation of the shelf-full of volumes in which they are im - bedded .

		A volume of ''
Ruskin	PERSON	's Principles of Art Criticism , '' compiled by Miss
Ida M. Street	PERSON	and published by
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, performs a real service in selecting and classifying and arranging the most fundamental of his utterances , prefacing each group with an adequate though brief introduc - tion concerning the special point of view .

		The pre - dominant note in
Ruskin	LOCATION	's teaching , whether in art or political economy , is - a spiritual one , as opposed to the materialism of the eighteenth and of the first half of the nineteenth centuries .

		Both as editor and expositor .

		Miss Street has brought this spiritual meaning clearly to the reader , and the work is to be commended as one of the best of its kind .

		No one has done more to draw the
National	ORGANIZATION	parks attention of the public to the desira - and reservations .

		.

		\ buity and necessity of forest preser - vation than Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	, the '' veteran of the Sierras , '' whose recent book on '' Our National Parks '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- embodies some of his most trenchant appeals for public interest and legislative action .

		The forest reservations , now 80 extensive , and our great national parks , the , breathing-places for the people , owe much to his untiring efforts .

		Nature wild and free is Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's delight , and he takes his readers through these great public parks and reservations , many of which are as yet but little known , with a sympathy which inspires and an enthusiasm which is conta - 164 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, gious .

		He rejoices in the flowers , the wild beasts are his friends .

		He delights in the trees , and worships the sequoid -- and who would not bow at such a shrine ?

		The prophet of the big trees is as free and unrestrained in his marshalling of adjec - tives as he is in his lonely travels in the
Sierras	LOCATION	, and his descriptions are as unconventional as the waterfall or the mountain peak which charms .

		Perhaps life in the open conduces to breeziness of style .

		The latest volume in the '' Library ISX ... of Natural History Romance '' -LRB- Fred - erick
Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is Mr.
Edward Step	PERSON	's '' Shell Life , '' an introduction to the British MoUusca .

		The author is a well-known leader among the many natural history field-clubs of En - gland , and his book is planned to meet the needs of the unscientific lover of nature .

		The greater part of the Mollusca indigenous in the British Isles and adjacent seas are briefly described in this little volume , whose utility is greatly enhanced by over six hundred excellent illustrations .

		The work is not intended to be a shell-collector 's manual , but rather to encourage a study of the living animals .

		Their structure , habits , mode of life , enemies , their many modifications for protection , and the adap - tations to their surroundings , are brought into greater prominence than is usual in works of this class .

		Well planned and well executed , it is a model popular guide .

		In accordance with the custom fostered in these societies of natural-history amateurs , our author uses common names for the shells .

		In a popular work this may be commend - able ; but it may become quite as pedantic and disagreeable as the binomial nomenclature of science .

		Contrast the `` Pod Razor '' with Solen viliqua !

		Euphony and precision , if not also usage , sanction the latter , while the former has only the vernacular to commend it .

		A recent writer has well said : `` Scientific names are no harder than others , simply less familiar , and when domesticated they cease to be hard . ''

		Mr.
Charles Townsend Copeland	PERSON	's Irftf ^ A. lif `` `` f
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, traces the ca - reer of the great tragedian in a manner characteristic of the '' Beacon Biographies '' -- in which series it appears .

		The author has quoted freely from previous records , and has also added to his own opinions extracts from contem - porary authors .

		A number of hitherto unpub - lished letters , written by Booth to Mr.
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, reveal incidents and minor touches of an eventful life .

		A rare photograph , which Booth considered his best likeness , is reproduced as frontispiece -- `` It was thus He looked ; such pallor touched his cheek ; With that same grace he greeted us -- Nay , 't is the man , could it hut speak ! ''

		Mr.
Copeland	PERSON	's book is one to be read attentively by those who take an intellectual interest in stage Material for the history of the Civil War .

		history ; owing to its conciseness , it recalls a very scarce volume -LRB- published in
1846	DATE	-RRB- called `` The Actor , '' a biographical sketch of the elder Booth .

		It is not with great expectations of either pleasure or profit that one takes up a book which on its face shows that it has been written by a man who is possessed by one idea , especially if the idea is a small one and the book is published by the author .

		Such a book is '' The Assassination of President Lincoln , '' written and published by Mr.
Osborn H. Oldroyd	PERSON	, of ``
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		But the experi - ence of the writer has been like that of him of old who came to scoff and remained to pray .

		He is glad to acknowledge that he has read the book with interest , and with the profit that comes from the study of abnormal character as it may affect a nation 's history .

		The author has carefully worked out every detail in the lives of the conspirators during the days that preceded the assassination , and their pursuit , trial , and execution ; and the book deserves a place on the shelves that hold the materials for the history of the Civil War .

		There are eighty-two illustrations .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Philippine Affairs : A Retrospect and Outlook , '' is the title of the book which contains President
Jacob Gould Schurman	PERSON	's recent
Boston	LOCATION	address , now put forth in convenient shape by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It is a publication which deserves the attention of all thoughtful Americans .

		President
Schurman	PERSON	is not exactly an anti-imperialist yet , but we have hopes of his complete conversion in time , for it has been evident all along that his conscience was troubling him , and that he has found it hard to approve of the administra - tion policy of the past three years .

		We particularly call attention to these closing words : '' Any decent kind of government of Filipinos by Filipinos is better than the best possible government of Filipinos by Americans . ''

		If this principle of action be once accepted , everything else that can fairly be urged in behalf of our national honor and ideals will follow as a logical consequence .

		The name of
John Amos Komensky	PERSON	, under its Latin - ized form Comenius , is well known to students of the educational art .

		That he was a philosopher whose speculations embraced a far wider field than that of education is a fact not so widely known .

		His ''
Laby	PERSON	- rinth of the World , '' for example , although a work of his youth , is one of the classics of Bohemian literature , and presents a wonderful picture of the life and thought of the early seventeenth century .

		This famous work , which is of the class that includes the '' Utopia '' and the ''
Civitas Solis	PERSON	, '' is also an allegory that has certain affinities with the '' Pilgrim 's Progress . ''

		It is differ - ent , because
Komensky	PERSON	was a scholar of wide range , whereas
Bunyan	PERSON	was a man of comparatively untutored mind and narrow outlook .

		Count Liitzon , in making an English translation of this work , has done a real service to comparative literature , and made accessible a really important document in the history of modern thought .

		The publisher wishes to correct an erroneous impression which seems to be gaining credence with regard to this book .

		It is not written in condemnation of Roman Cath - olicism ; on the contrary , the author is himself a Roman Catholic , who has spent much of his life in
Rome	LOCATION	, and who is therefore thoroughly conversant with Roman influence .

		His purpose is to expose , as , indeed , did Dante himself , the fallacious theory of the temporal supremacy of the Vicar of Christ .

		The Pope , he argues , weakens the power of his spiritual heritage by grasping at a worldly power he was never intended to wield .

		Rabbi Krauskopf : '' The story is excellently written ; it holds the reader spell-bound from first to last .

		It is a strongly purposive book .

		The author deals with facts , the names are but guises of actual personages well known in aristocratic circles in
England	LOCATION	and in
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

March , 1902	DATE	A Romance of Great Charm Irish Gallantry in the
Last Century Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Southern Character THE THRALL OF LEIP THE LUCKY A STORY OF VIKING DAYS By
Ottilie A. Liljencrantz	PERSON	With 6 full-page illustrations in color , and other embellishments , by Troy and
Marj?aret Kinney	PERSON	.

		12mo .


$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		SELDOM has a new work by a new author been offered to the public with such confidence in its immediate success .

		But this wonderful story of
Leif Ericssen	PERSON	's voyage , with every page permeated with the romance and fascination of the Viking days , is so fresh and inspired , and carries the reader so irresistibly into the wild free life of the Norsemen , that it is difficult to imagine how any one can withstand its charm .

		The hero is a young Englishman of noble birth , who has been captured by the Vikings , and is sold to
Leif Ericsson	PERSON	as a thrall .

		The story concerns his ad - ventures among
Leif	PERSON	's band of sea-rovers , and also his very stormy wooing of the beautiful
Helga	PERSON	, a most fascinating heroine .

		Alwin is the name of the young thrall , and he is brave , spirited , and wilful under his restraint .

		This intolerance brings the gravest consequences , and more than once his reckless defiance of his masters all but ends his career .

		The characters , the background , and the atmosphere of the story are so unusual and new in the world of fiction that The Thrall of Leif the Lucky will be most welcome to the novel reader who longs for `` something different . ''

H. A. HiNKsoN	PERSON	Author of '' The King 's Deputy . ''

		NO BETTER idea can be given of the dashing Irish gentlemen in Mr.
Hinkson	PERSON	's book than the author 's Foreword : `` These men once lived and had strenuous lives .

		The blood that was in them was generous as the wine that enriched it .

		They feared neither the buttered claret at night , nor the blaze of the pistol in the morn - ing , and their honour was as untarnished as the bright steel of their sword-blades .

		The saddle was their cradle , pointblankers were their playthings .

		THE DIAL 185 THE BATTLEGROUND By
ELLEN GLASGOW	PERSON	IN THIS vigorous and delightful story
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	has written a more mature and stronger novel than even her very successful `` The Voice of the People . ''

		It deals with
Virginia	LOCATION	home life immediately before and during the Civil War , and the dramatic pictures of the bloody struggle are heightened in effect by the fascinating background of old-fashioned culture and refinement which existed among the ante-bellum gentlefolk .

		The two girls are as charming types of Southern '' belles '' as have ever been portrayed in fiction , while the book sparkles with delightful humor .

		It is one of the most human and illumin - ating pictures of those terrible times that has ever been written .

		Illustrated by
W. Granville Smith	PERSON	and

$ 1.50	MONEY	The LEOPARD 'S Spots A Romance of the White Man 's Burden By
THOMAS DIXON	PERSON	, JR. .

		T ^ His NOVEL is as remarkable in its way as A THOUSAND COPIES of this novel were wired for two months before publication by a Southern retail dealer ; one jobber ordered another thousand ; and advance orders of 100 and 250 copies were common from firms which usually order from 10 to 25 copies .

		Although it is Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's first booky the first edition was 15,000 copies . ''

		Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' was when it first appeared .

		That book gave , in the form of fiction , a picture of the Negro 's sufferings from the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	point of view .

		Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's book gives the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	point of view of the same question , and as a picture it is as graphic and as striking as Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's book .

		No matter what may be the reader 's opinion about the race problem , it is certainly right that an adequate presentation of the Southern view in the form of fiction , which is easy to read and which carries conviction by its very sin - cerity , should be studied by people who have not known the facts .

		INTERNATIONAL AMITY .

		NOTES 216 A full generation has now pa8.sed since the publication of '' The Coming Race , '' by the versatile novelist who had given us books as various as '' Pelham , '' '' A Strange Story , '' ``
Harold	PERSON	, '' `` The Caxtons , '' and ''
Ken	PERSON	elm Chillingly . ''

		This forecast was impressive in many ways , but in no way more impressive than in its assertion that war would eventually be made impossible through improvements in the means of destruction .

		Weapons would become so deadly that war would practically mean annihilation of the contending forces , and the good sense of the nations would prevail in the abandonment of this barbaric way of set - tling disputes .

		The past thirty years have witnessed , not exactly the literal fulfillment of this prediction , but marked progress in the direction of its fulfillment , and , as a natural consequence of the increased effectiveness of fighting instruments , a marked reluctance to resort to the arbitrament of war .

		Within much more recent years , a great Russian authority upon the art of war , as well as a man of the widest experience in practical affairs , has argued with convincing logic that war is fast becoming a practical impossibility .

		This beneficent result of scientific progress is due , not simply , as in
Bulwer	LOCATION	's argument , be - cause of the increasing deadliness of weapons , but rather because , with this increasing deadli - ness , the advantage to the defense becomes so much greater than the advantage to the attack that all wars of the ordinary type , in which an invading army seeks to conquer a foreign country , must henceforth be so hopelessly one - sided as to be entirely futile .

		The position of the late M. de
Bloch	PERSON	has received ample con - firmation during the course of the distressing struggles of the last three years , in
South Africa	LOCATION	and the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, and the lesson of these conflicts is not likely to be missed .

		Entirely aside from the moral issues involved , both of these wars have borne out the essential assertion of
M. de Bloch	ORGANIZATION	that a small body of men , armed with the modern means of defense , can resist , for an indefinite period , an invading body of overwhelmingly superior strength .

		In making this principle clear , it 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, may well happen that these wars will prove to have been blessings in disguise , and that the last turning-point in the centuries may prove to have been a real turning-point in the history of mankind .

		A glance at the European situation seems to us also to offer reassuring signs .

		A few years ago a general conflict of the powers seemed inevitable , anil it was doubtful whether the century would end without the precipita - tion of hostilities .

		To - day the danger seems far less imminent , and it looks as if the great international rivalries and jealousies might somehow be settled by peaceful means .

		There is the
Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	, for example .

		It is customary to speak slightingly of that remark - able gathering , but it was nevertheless symp - tomatic of the growing strength of cosmopolitan opinion .

		This is a factor in warfare which must henceforth be recognized , and , while it has not averted the deplorable wars of the last few years , it has made those responsible for them feel very uncomfortable .

		We have little doubt that the historian of the future will look back to the Tsar 's eirenicon as to the begin - ning of a new era in international relations , and that the permanent tribunal which remains as the substantial result of the Hague Confer - ence will be invoked more than once .

		The growing conviction of the impossibility of accomplishing by means of warfare what has been easily accomplished by the stronger force in past years is already acting as a quiet deterrent upon the minds of generals and states - men .

		Cooperating with this influence is the other influence which comes from the growth of international sympathies and the cementing of the bonds of friendship in many obtrusive and unobtrusive ways .

		There is a story afloat that
Prince Henry	PERSON	of
Prussia	LOCATION	the other day , in an ex - pansive moment , said that he was having the time of his life in
America	LOCATION	, adding that when at home they only used him to send to funerals .

		Certainly a better use has been found for him than that , when his few days ' stay in this country has been productive of so much good-will and mutual esteem between the two great nations concerned in the exchange of courtesies .

		When the surface-character of the visit , its pomp and its parade , shall have been forgotten , when the tumult and the shouting shall have died away , its symbolical character will remain as the one memorable thing about it , and will be likely to influence the relations between
Germany	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	for many years to come .

		The visit will remain a gracious memory long after the glitter of the event shall have * grown dim in our recollection .

		Another recent event of similar significance has been the visit of the Baron d'Estournelles de Constant , bearing the greetings of the great
European Republic	LOCATION	to its sister Republic in the
West	LOCATION	.

		This distinguished statesman , journeying from
Paris	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	for the ex - press purpose of paying a Frenchman 's tribute to the memory of the greatest of Americans , has pleaded in eloquent terms for the cause of international good will , for the sinking of political jealousies and commercial rivalries in the larger interests of the common human - ity of the race , and wherever he has spoken , his noble idealism -- which is nevertheless that of a practical man of the world -- has aroused echoes of responsive sympathy in the breasts of his hearers .

		Now the influence which is represented by such visits as these , and sup - plemented by the many other modern agencies which tend to the creation of a mutual un - derstanding between our own people and those of a foreign country , amounts in the total sum to an incalculably great force exerted in the interests of civilization and for the removal of ancient prejudice .

		Whenever men are brought together on the basis of a common interest , whether intellectual or social , the racial barriers erst raised between them are at once cast down , and are as if they had never existed .

		Every international gathering of men of politics , of science , or of literature , offers a silent but effective protest against the passions which set nations at war with one another .

		We do not expect that the world will be swayed by reason alone for many generations yet .

		Nevertheless , the ascendancy of reason is by slow degrees making itself felt .

		In spite of all discouragements , '' man is being made , '' in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's phrase , and '' Prophet-eyes may catch a glory slowly gaining on the shade . ''

		To the logical mind the outcome of the evolu - tionary process , however long-delayed , is sure .

		Such a mind must admit that even patriotism is selfishness , although at several removes from what we commonly call by that name .

		There is the selfishness of the individual , first of all , which has no redeeming quality .

		Then there is the selfishness of the family , in which the element of altruism first appears .

		Then there is the selfishness of the clan , the nation , and the race , and in each of these stages of the sentiment the altruistic character becomes more and more marked , until the clear thinker
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 193 finds it impossible to believe that even race should set an absolute barrier to his sympa - thies , or that anything less than the whole of mankind should be held in his affection .

		To take this final step to a complete altruism is , no doubt , to overcome the . ''

		last infirmity of noble mind , '' -- no easy task , -- yet was it not taken by a Roman freedman over two thousand years ago , and did not the audience in the
Koman	PERSON	theatre greet with thunders of applause the famous line which declared that no man may remain unconcerned by aught that touches ithe interests of humanity at large ?

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		WHO READS THE GOOD OLD BOOKS ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A recent article in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' gives a just and • appreciative tribute to the poet
George Crabbe	PERSON	, which ' I am sure will do something toward the revival of his poetry , if it is in need of reviving .

		The writer in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' wonders why
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	is not now read .

		Per - mit me to answer that he is read .

		Let no one draw the inference that because standard books are not adver - tised and bruited in the critical and personal columns of newspapers and magazines , therefore they are not read .

		They do not need such exploitation ; they have passed that unhappy experimental stage , and have come # nally to their own .

		They rest from the dread ordeal which a novel venture must undergo .

		The crowd goes to see a new invention put in operation ; when it is a ■ success , they stay at home and reap and enjoy the benefits of it .

		Crabbe , and many other good old authors like him , are still read by those to whom newspaper advertising and uncritical puffery of books have become a nuisance and a stench in the nostrils .

		It seems as though the last degradation of literature had arrived when quantity rather than quality is the criterion .

		But let us take courage ; it is only noise , bluster , superlatives , large type , and monotonous adjectives that make us feel for the moment that all discrimination is submerged , all real distinction no longer possible .

		Far away in more quiet seats , the wise and sincere lovers of good litera - ture are still reading good books , the good old ones , ^ and sometimes the good new ones which are equals of the old and by some miracle creep in between the pushing and blatant hundred-thousand editions of phe - nomenal and soon-to-be-forgotten works .

		What , in general , is a new book ?

		It is one you do not care to read again , -- only another , newer one .

		Such books are printed to sell ; they do not endure , and never do they depose the old .

		They may be kept on the surface of a shallow and rapid stream , but sink when they come to deeper and wider waters , waters navigated by experienced pilots sailing by the sun and stars .

		All the while these monstrous editions of pop - ular books are being printed , there goes on the quiet isale and reading of those to which the seal of time and fame has been set , and from which the accidents of chance have been eliminated .

		The fact that certain writers are relegated to the rear in catalogues , and are no more mentioned by reviewers , is no index to their real place in literature or to their permanent sale .

		A recent critic , in a publication devoted incidentally to the review of books and chiefly to miscellaneous lit - erary news and gossip , had the temerity to state , in effect , that there was no longer any sale for
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		He had his ready figures , -- for these critics are mathematical in their distribution of honors to authors , and settle their position by the formula , '' How many copies does he sell in a week ? ''

		They forget to inquire in regard to the steadiness of the demand , or the class of readers , -- which latter point is the most important of all for any just estimate of the ultimate fate of a book .

		As for
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, I repeat that he is read .

		I am a very obscure person , living in one of the most remote corners of
New England	LOCATION	; yet I still read
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	with admiration , and I know of others who do .

		I can not believe that we are exceptional ; nor can I doubt that among those of larger opportunities , and with an am - bition to know the best in English literature , there must still be numerous readers of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Tales . ''

		But whether there are or not , makes no difference to us .

		We stand up boldly , and are not ashamed to de - clare that we read and admire these works , and that they ought to be read and admired .

		If we need an ally and defender , there is
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, a man whose instincts were infallible in poetry .

		I was very glad to see that the writer in ' `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' laid much emphasis upon the '' atmosphere '' of the '' Tales . ''

		This is true insight .

		To be sure , `` atmosphere '' is rather a large and a vague word ; but there is none nearer the thing meant , and after reading Crabbe one may feel the force of the term and need not try to analyze it .

		Let him enjoy it , and give the poet his due measure of praise .

		This ** atmosphere '' is , I believe , the distinguishing characteristic which
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	would claim for his work ; for , contrasting his own style -- in the preface to the second series of '' Tales '' -- with that of Pope , he says that the poems of Pope are without '' atmosphere . ''

		The style of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	is simple enough ; it has no conceits and little embroidery ; the plots are rather bare and loose-jointed .

		When he paints '' men , man - ners , and things , '' which he says is his chief aim , his pen is truly his own , and inimitable .

		This is why I believe he is still read , -- such is my faith in the liv - ing strength and continuance of the attraction which real literature possesses .

		PROFESSOR MiJNSTERBERG 'S BOOK ON
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Many Americans , not conspicuously lacking in loy - alty to their land and its institutions , will deeply regret Dr.
Wergeland	PERSON	's censure , in The Dial for
Feb. 16	DATE	, of Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's '' American Traits from the Point of View of a German . ''

		Sincere students of in - ternational relations have for years yearned to see such a candid expression concerning
America	LOCATION	, after all the prejudices , caricatures , and traditional misrepresenta - tions upon which the Germans are everlastingly harp - ing .

		Here is a foreign scholar with eyes and a heart , fair-minded , sound , and modern , who actually tells the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .

		He shows how ignorance has led to mutual antipathy where there should be sympathy between Americans and Ger - mans ; as he significantly puts it , '' they do not like each 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, other , because they do not regard each other as gentle - men . ''

		Professor
MUnsterberg	PERSON	is the first man , as far as I know -LRB- with the possible exception of
Herman Grimm	PERSON	-RRB- , to show that the typical American is an ideal - ist through and through , and not essentially greedy and vulgar , brutal and corrupt .

		Quite as helpful are the little-understood truths which he tells us about his own people -LRB- of unusual interest being his comparison between the Emperor
William	PERSON	and
Theodore Roose	PERSON	- velt -RRB- , and even more valuable are his open , friendly , and impartial suggestions about some features of our own civilization .

		Is it true that
America	LOCATION	prefers to work out its diffi - cult problems '' with little aid from foreigners '' ?

		In my opinion , such aid is most welcome , when tendered in a wise and humane spirit .

		THE DICTIONARY MADE FOR MAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Anent some recent discussion in your columns of the permissibility of '' proven '' as past participle of '' prove , '' and of similar discussions regarding '' correct usage , '' I beg to call attention to a recent address of Professor
E. S. Sheldon	PERSON	as President of the
American Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	, entitled '' Practical Philology . ''

		As one of the chief workers on the last edition of the
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	he might be expected to favor the doctrine of the infallibility of the dictionary .

		But observe how he regards the matter : '' Among the misconceptions which embarrass us , espe - cially at the outset , in our teaching is the narrow view often taken of the relation of grammar to language and of the dic - tionary to language .

		People are accustomed to look upon grammar as containing the rules to which they must conform in the use of language , and they are only too apt to think that the larger English dictionaries contain all the words that anybody has the right to use in speaking or writing English , and that any word in the dictionary may be so used .

		We should hardly need to explain that we look upon grammar simply as the description of the structure of a language , of its condition during some definite period of its constantly chang - ing history , and that to us a dictionary is a more or less in - complete list of the words and phrases used in a language in some period of its life , with definitions , often inexact , of these words and phrases . ''

		And further : '' We must accept the principle that in the use of lan - guage , whether it be a question of syntax that arises , or one about the proper pronunciation of a word , good usage is de - cisive .

		The philologist can perhaps tell what would be the regular pronunciation if phonetic laws were observed without any interference of disturbing influences , but it does not fol - low that the regular pronunciation is really the correct one . ''

		And the same attitude is correct regarding the forms of the verb '' prove , '' or any other matter of language .

		By various processes , such as analogy and euphony , strong verbs have become weak and weak verbs have become strong .

		If '' prove '' shows a tendency to de - velop a strong past participle after the analogy of '' woven , '' there is no more reason for virtuous indigna - tion and protest than when the orange develops a seed - less '' sport , '' or when the neglected apple reverts to its thorny kind .

		All are processes of nature .

		The dic - tionary was made for man , and not man for the diction - ary .

		However , in an imperfect and belated way , the grammar and the dictionary attempt to tell the rank a , nd file of us what srood usage is .

		*
King George the Second	ORGANIZATION	was one day prom - enading in state on the Broad Walk at
Ken	PERSON	- sington with the Royal Family , when a little girl who , with her French governess , had come to view the spectacle , broke away from the astonished '' mamselle '' and danced up to his
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	with the laughing salute , -- '' Comment vous portez-vous .

		Monsieur le Roi ?

		Vous avez une grande et belle maison ici , n'est - ce pas ? ''

		Old King
George	PERSON	was delighted with this naivete ^ and desired the little maid to be brought often to see him .

		At these visits she frequently found her royal host either en - gaged with one of the court ladies or busy counting out his money , which he used to receive regularly every
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	; but he was always glad to break off and have a romp with his little friend .

		On one of these occasions he suddenly snatched the child up and popped her into a great china jar that stood in the room , shutting down the cover on her to prove her courage .

		But the little pris - oner immediately began in a merry voice to sing the French song , '' Malbruc , '' which so delighted her jailor that he straightway re - leased her .

		This lively and interesting child was Lady
Sarah Lennox	PERSON	, fourth daughter of
Charles	PERSON	, second Duke of
Richmond	LOCATION	, and Lady

		She was born in

		Fifteen years later the young Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	was smitten with her beauty and winsome ways , and soon after his accession made overtures of matrimony to her , which after some hesitation she accepted .

		But objections to the marriage were raised in various quarters , and the claims of Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg were pressed upon the youthful ruler until he yielded and renounced the lady of his choice .

		She was touched rather with scorn at her lover 's duplicity and inconstancy than with grief at his loss ; and as her thoughts were just then preoccupied with the death of a pet squirrel , the whole affair moved her but little .

		THE DIAL 196 frailty -- is its keynote , and fittingly enough , for she was the offspring of a romantic mar - riage .

		Its singular details are worth record - ing here .

		Charles , Duke of
Richmond	LOCATION	, one of the Lords of the Bedchamber to King
George II.	PERSON	, had been , as was not unusual in those days , married while yet a mere boy to a young lady not of his own choice .

		His girl bride was Lady
Sarah	PERSON	, daughter of that
Earl Cadogan	PERSON	who distinguished himself as a cavalry officer in the
Duke of Marlborough	ORGANIZATION	's wars .

		This match was made to cancel a gambling debt , the young people 's consent being the last thing thought of .

		The bridegroom , then
Earl	PERSON	of
March	DATE	, was summoned from school , and the bride brought from her nursery ; a clergyman was in attendance , and the children were told that they were immediately to be made man and wife .

		The young lady offered no com - ment , but the lad exclaimed , '' They surely are not going to marry me to that dowdy ! ''

		Married , however , he was , after which a post - chaise was called , and the young husband was packed off with his tutor to make the '' grand tour , '' while his bride was sent back to her mother .

		After some years abroad Lord
March	DATE	returned , a well educated , handsome young man , with no very agreeable recollections of his child wife .

		Thus it was that , instead of hastening to her embraces , he made his way to the opera , where he amused himself between the acts in examining the assembled company .

		He had not long been thus occupied when a very young and beautiful woman caught his attention , and he turned to a gentleman beside him and inquired her name .

		`` You must be a stranger in
London	LOCATION	, '' was the reply , '' not to know the toast of the town , the beautiful Lady
March	DATE	. ''

		Most agreeably surprised , the er - rant husband hastened to the lady 's box and claimed her as his bride , -- the very '' dowdy '' from whom he had scornfully turned away at their first meeting , but with whom he after - ward lived so happily that she died of a broken heart within a twelvemonth of his decease in
1750	DATE	.

		To return to the subject of this sketch .

		Lady
Sarah	PERSON	appeared as chief bridesmaid at the marriage of the king who had so ardently courted and so coolly rejected her , and she had the satisfaction of noting that even then he had eyes only for her .

		A few months later she herself was married , at the age of seven - teen , to the eldest son of Sir
William Bun	PERSON	- bury .

		She continued to have many admirers after her marriage , and for one of them , her cousin , Lord
William Gordon	PERSON	, she appears to have entertained a warmer regard than con - sisted with her duty as a wife .

		A separation followed , and then a divorce ; but after that the injured husband paid her occasional visits and even wished to remarry her .

		In
1781	DATE	Lady
Sarah	PERSON	married the Hon.
George Napier	PERSON	, who had lost his first wife two years before .

		He had served through the American war , and he afterward held high military office .

		By her second husband Lady
Sarah	PERSON	became the mother of three daughters and five sons , in - cluding
Charles	PERSON	,
George	PERSON	, and
William	PERSON	, who adopted their father 's profession , rose high in the service , and all three took part in the Pen - insular War , of which Sir
William	PERSON	has left his well-known history .

		Charles was the con - queror of Scinde , and each of the three broth - ers was eventually knighted for distinguished services to his country .

		To her large family Lady
Sarah	PERSON	appears to have been an exem - plary mother , carefully providing for the edu - cation of her boys out of a very modest income , and in every way showing herself worthy of tke high honor that her famous sons afterward brought her .

		Her husband 's death in
1804	DATE	made her task the more difficult , until the king , her sometime lover , granted her a gen - erous pension in recognition of
Colonel Napier	ORGANIZATION	's services .

		She passed her declining years in
London	LOCATION	, where she died , surrounded by her children , at the age of eighty-one .

		Such , in outline , is the life which the Coun - tess Ilchester and her son .

		Lord Stavordale , have presented for our edification and amuse - ment .

		Two contemporary memoirs , by the first Lord
Holland	PERSON	and by Mr.
Henry Napier	PERSON	, son of Lady
Sarah	PERSON	, are here published for the first time in full ; and they are followed by a generous selection from Lady
Sarah	PERSON	's letters , and prefaced by a biographical introduction .

		To those who , with Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, are fond of `` turning off the turnpike of history to loiter down the primrose paths of men 's memoirs of themselves and their times , '' this book will afford no little entertainment , all the more perhaps that the '' men 's memoirs '' are in this case a woman 's , and a very wide-awake wo - man 's , too .

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		German and

		Perhaps Shakespeare is drawing the nations together by a tie more ' universal than that of the new learning of the

		At the moment when Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	is launching the first of a series of substantial volumes descrip - tive of '' Shakespearean Wars , '' it is profitable to bear in mind that critics the world over seem less inclined to fall out about
Shakespeare • Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	as a Dramatic Artist .

		than about any other subject imaginable .

		Specifically , the agreement seems general among intelligent readers everywhere that Shake - speare was not merely a child of genius , a rare poet , a keen observer , and a happy delineator of human action and passion ; but that he was withal an unrivalled dramatic artist .

		It is no longer the fashion to attribute his successes to an astonishing conjunction of untutored genius and good luck ; nor to assume that his depar - tures from trodden ways were due to his lam - entable ignorance .

		Surely no literary mon - uments have ever been the objects of more searching scrutiny than that to which these plays have been subjected during the past cen - tury .

		The result is comparable to the immense widening of man 's conception of the universe upon the acceptance of the Copernican theory .

		There was a time when
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	could hesitate and
Bacon	PERSON	refuse to accept that theory , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	criticism was in much the same stage little more than a century ago .

		If Gar - rick went beyond bounds in admiration for '' the god of his idolatry , '' Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was there to assert that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	never has six lines without a fault , that
Congreve	PERSON	had writ - ten a better descriptive passage than can be found in all Shakespeare , that
Tate	PERSON	's alteration of the conclusion of ''
King Lear	PERSON	'' was an im - provement .

		Garrick himself imagined he had done his author a service by clearing the play of Hamlet of '' all the rubbish of the fifth act . ''

		Modern criticism , of which
Lessing	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge were the morning stars , has indeed thrown a much stronger light upon Shakespeare ; but , what is still more important , it has placed us at a more advantageous point of view .

		We now perceive clearly that these plays are greatly planned .


Marlowe	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	PERSON	saw , if
Sidney	PERSON	did not see , that the dramatic art of
Seneca	LOCATION	had had its day , -- if , indeed , it may be said to have had so much .

		If these dramatists were somewhat regardless of ancient lights , it was because , having the sun , they felt no need of other illumination .

		Shakespeare is quite as well aware what he is about as was Sophocles .

		If the mirror which the modern master holds up to nature be not more perfect than that of the Greeks , it is certainly more variously and widely faithful ; while the images it presents are none the less works of creative art .

		Such is the point of view at which modern sympathetic criticism has established us and which the minute research of scholars of sev - eral nationalities , headed by the Germans , en - ables us to defend .

		THE DIAL .

		197 volume is devoted to a history of the contro - versies that raged in the seventeenth century and throughout the eighteenth with respect to the legitimacy of the dramatic art of Shake - speare , and of the vicissitudes through which the reputation of the great dramatist had to pass before reaching a place beyond the reach of envy .

		We are informed that this is only the first of a series of volumes having to do with what the author chooses to term '' Shake - spearean Wars . ''

		The title seems singular in view of the humane and peaceful temper which made the poet 's contemporaries unanimous in applying to his name the epithet of gentle .

		Its grim irony is not lessened when we think who it was that prophesied -LRB- and how truly ! -RRB- ''

		I came not to send peace , but a sword . ''

		A general enumeration of the contents of the volume now published may give some notion of its scope .

		Three chapters deal with the gradual development of the right view of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's neglect of the dramatic unities of time and place ; one , respectively , upon the intermingling of the comic and the tragic , upon stage representations of bloodshed and violence , upon minor dramatic conventions -LRB- such as the use of prose , rhyme , and blank verse -RRB- , and upon the alterations to which so many of the plays were subjected .

		There are two chapters upon the conflicting views of critics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and a final chapter dealing with the dramatist 's dis - regard of the conventional theory of poetic justice .

		These important subjects Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury handles with clearness and vivacity .

		He has made a comprehensive survey of a field which has been too much neglected , and his book is , on the whole , a substantial contribu - tion to Shakespearean criticism .

		If he has fallen short of producing a model of the way literary history should be written , it is not because of any defect in learning or vigor .

		His analysis of his subject is perspicuous , his argument cogent , his general attitude sane and just .

		Such a combination of qualities is so comparatively rare that to ask for anything more may appear ungrateful .

		Both the style and the habit of mind frequently recall Ma - caulay , who was not , even in his own opinion , a good literary critic .

		There are some of the same mannerisms , there is a similar tone of being '' cocksure , '' and , far worse , there is a similar tendency to disregard , or inability to perceive , the nuance -- the delicate distinc - tions wherein the truth is apt to lie concealed .

		The similarity of the style to
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's does not extend to the main excellences of that great stylist .

		The style of the book before us is sometimes diffuse and too frequently slipshod .

		There are some rather desperate attempts at humor , which may help us to account for the author 's want of appreciation of Shake - speare 's light word-play .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	feels and expresses nothing but loathing for the '' quips and cranks and wanton wiles '' which are often so charming a feature of the plays , and which furnish such interesting evi - dences of the taste of that time and of the master 's ability to do whatever he liked with words .

		But such considerations are too nice , involving as they do some degree of artistic self-detachment , -- a thing quite foreign to this critic 's robustly subjective habit of mind .

		Shakespeare 's quibbles and plays upon words exemplify '' the lowest form of intellectual de - pravity '' ; they are '' dreadful , '' '' execrable intellectually , '' '' inexpressibly wretched , '' '' vic - ious . ''

		A moral consolation is found in the theory that licentious allusions are generally wrapped up in verbal quibbles which have been rendered obscure by the changes in the mean - ings of words .

		It is easy to imagine what would have been
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's comment upon all this .

		The author might easily have made the vol - ume of much greater value to scholars by being less chary of footnotes , by giving a greater number of facts in support of his gen - eralizations , and by taking care to give the reader an opportunity at every point to verify statements .

		The audience he has in view seems to be that intelligent middle class of readers who care more for the results than the processes of scholarship .

		At page 382 , with reference to the early editions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays the following sentence occurs : ' * Fur - thermore , wlien once ` published ^ no one of his contemporaries equalled him in the frequency of republication during the century in which his death took place . ''

		The italics are mine .

		This is a sample of the author 's manner of expressing himself , -- style it can hardly be called .

		The careful reader is given no means of verifying this statement ; some bibliographi - cal data in a footnote would have been welcome .

		But the author has a fine scorn for the class of readers at whom he repeatedly sneers as the '' select few . ''

		Speaking of
Mason	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Carac	PERSON	- tacus , '' he takes occasion to remark : 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, '' It was a saying of Aristotle that the mass of men are better judges of music and poetry than a small number of them , however eminent .


Mason	PERSON	's fortunes furnish an additional proof to the many that exist of the justice of the dictum , rightly understood .

		All the glorification of his poetry by the select few could never make him really popular '' -LRB- p. 247 -RRB- .

		The reader is given no clue to the quotation from
Aristotle	LOCATION	and is left in doubt whether the dictum is '' rightly understood '' by the writer himself .

		Assuming that
Aristotle	PERSON	made use of an expression equivalent to '' the mass of men , '' did he mean by it just what the hasty reader whom the author is addressing will be likely to infer ?

		It does not appear that there was anything exclusively '' select '' about those who admired
Mason	PERSON	in his day .

		Bos - well , for example , regarded '' Caractacus '' as a masterpiece ; Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	ridiculed it .

		Possibly the expression '' select few , '' as used here and elsewhere , is intended ironically ; but the class of readers who will be edified by such passages as the above will draw the inference that , with respect to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the critics have always been in the wrong and the uncrit - ical always in the right .

		Until the present volume shall be out of print , it will be cited on lecture platforms and in reading circles in support of the cheering democratic doctrine that a Bowery music-hall audience has , after all , a sounder taste in music than Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore
Thomas	PERSON	.

		In opposition to Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's citation of Aristotle let us quote an authority at least as good in such matters : '' ... the censure of the which one must , in your allowance , o'erweigh a whole theatre of others . ''

		The great dramatist had quite as much regard as had
Milton	PERSON	for the `` fit audi - ence '' and was quite as well aware that such an audience is always the few .

		If Shake - speare 's audience has been relatively large , it has no doubt always included a fair sprinkling of the '' select few . ''

		This volume is put forth under the auspices of a great university as one of the examples of the researches of its professors .

		It is but just that such a publication should be judged by a higher standard than that by which a volume of Sunday-evening lectures by the average clergyman is judged by the religious weekly of his denomination .

		The impression forces itself upon one that the author might have made the book much better , and that he has not deemed it worth his while to give anxious attention to details .

		Meanwhile to our chorus of indolent reviewers it makes no odds how a man writes nor how inexact may be his state - ments , so long as he presents us with a readable book , written in a confident tone .

		The reader of Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's volume has scarcely turned a leaf before being con - fronted with a gratuitous assumption put for - ward with an air of positiveness .

		Referring to the early opinion that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was the representative of nature and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	of art , the author remarks that this distinction '' May not be absolutely implied in the well-known ref - erence in ' L'Allegro ' to the * native woodnotes wild ' of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and the • learned sock ' of
Jonson	PERSON	.

		But in
Milton	LOCATION	's lines prefixed to the folio of
1632	DATE	there can be little question that , in asserting that the former writer 's ease of composition was to the shame of slow - endeavoring art , the great Puritan poet had also the latter writer in mind . ''

		Passing over the clumsiness of the compo - sition , I must in justice to the author remark that , in his dialect , the formula '' there can be little question '' means little more than '' it is just possible '' from the pen of a cautious writer .

		It may also be suggested by the way that the young man who on this notable oc - casion first saw himself in print was yet far from being '' the great Puritan poet . ''

		In the absence of evidence , there is every reason to assume that the young poet would not have seized upon precisely this occasion to gird at the first man of letters of the time ; a man whom
Milton	PERSON	read and respected ; a man now advanced in years and extremely sensitive ; and who would be sure to see the passage , placed as it was by the side of his own une - quivocal and enthusiastic tribute to the su - premacy of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's art .

		As every student of Milton knows , his own art was of the '' slow-endeavoring '' kind , the numerous erasures and interlineations in his manuscripts giving proof that he was a poet of happy after - thoughts .

		He may have taken his cue from the words of Heminge and Condell : '' His mind and hand went together : and what he thought he uttered with that easiness , that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers . ''

		This would very naturally have sug - gested to
Milton	LOCATION	, by contrast , his own blotted papers .

		To adopt our author 's formula , '' There can be little question '' that
Milton	PERSON	has given us in this passage one of the first of his many autobiographical references ; and that the con - trast he had in mind was that which , he felt , existed between the easy numbers of the great dramatist and those in which he himself plucked the unripe myrtle-berries '' with forced fingers rude . ''

		I add a few brief corrections : At page 13
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 the play of '' Hamlet '' is said to '' disregard utterly '' the unity of place .

		On the contrary , this unity as defined at page 10 and as prac - ticed by
Ben Jonson	PERSON	is strictly preserved in '' Hamlet . ''

		The '' plain in
Denmark	LOCATION	'' -LRB- IV .

		iv . -RRB-

		is an unnecessary invention of the editors .

		Hamlet meets the troops on his passage from the castle , which overlooks the sea , to the neigh - boring place of embarkation .

		In the detailed analysis of the play of '' Volpone '' one of the most striking and dramatic incidents is over - looked : the attempt of the parasite
Mosca	PERSON	to keep possession of the estate vs ^ hich has been temporarily handed over to him -LRB- V. iii -RRB- .

		At page 307 , the title of D'Avenant 's play is misquoted .

		At page 138 , a fine sentence from Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	is quoted and pronounced `` somewhat ambiguous . ''

		The sentence is quoted thus : '' Tragicomedy , he said , ' how - ever generally condemned , her own laurels have hitherto shaded from the fulminations of criticism . ' ''

		Whereupon Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury comments : '' The end apparently con - tradicts the beginning . ''

		Here he goes out of his way to condemn what he does not under - stand .


Johnson	PERSON	's allusion is of course to the belief that the laurel can not be hurt by light - ning .

		He says , in substance , that although thunderbolts have been launched against tragi - comedy , they have been ine # fectual .

		The bibliography , arranged by years , is not easy of reference when the date of a publication is not stated in the text .

		In conclusion I repeat that the book is not only interesting but well worth reading .

		Even those versed in the subject will gather sug - gestions from its pages .

		It is greatly to be hoped that , in the volumes that ate to succeed , the author will cultivate correctness and pre - cision of style , rather than vigor , of which he has enough and to spare ; that he will be more liberal in the disbursement of his stores of fact in exemplification of general statements ; that he will be less sparing of footnotes and exact references to authorities ; that , in short , he will direct his thought to a somewhat more exacting audience than he seems to have had in view .

		I have left myself too little space for an adequate tribute to the excellence of Dr. Fur - ness 's noble edition of ''
Twelfth Night	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This is the less to be regretted inasmuch as little is to be said of it except in the way of praise .

		The character and merits of the '' New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare '' are known to all scholars and have often been referred to in these columns .

		The first volume was published more than thirty years ago ; the one before us is the thirteenth .

		Inasmuch as two volumes were devoted to '' Hamlet , '' and one to each of the other plays , '' Twelfth Night '' is the twelfth play in the series .

		In at least one im - portant respect Dr.
Furness	PERSON	resembles his author : no one else could have improved upon his work .

		This '' Variorum '' edition is so much superior to anything of the kind ever thought of before that the early volumes were at once recognized as approaching about as near perfection as human work may .

		Yet it is hardly too much to affirm that every suc - ceeding issue of the series has been , in some important respect , superior to the foregoing .

		Perhaps Dr.
Furness	PERSON	reached the limit beyond which '' the force of Nature could no further go '' in the edition of '' Much Ado about Nothing '' * ; it is enough to say that the present volume does not perceptibly fall below its im - mediate foregoer .

		I have marked several minor lapses , -- such they appear to me , -- but it would be attributing undue importance to them to cite them here .

		In the course of the minute scrutmy of every word of a play and of every word about it , no human wit could remain in - variably unclouded .

		Amid such a din of voices , the voice of our great editor is always welcome , and is apt to be the one that leads the discus - sion back to sense and harmony .

		His union of brightness and urbanity is always charming .

		His chief defect is an occasional and , I think , an increasing tendency to supersubtlety .

		It is as a moderator of the extreme pronounce - ments of others that his fitness for his place at the head of the board is most happily shown .

		He holds his own in comparison with the best commentators , however celebrated their names , and has fairly earned his primacy among ed - itors of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is perhaps seldom that two books pub - lished almost at the same time so complement each other as the recent volumes of Miss
Singleton	PERSON	and Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	.

		The nearly simultaneous issue of these somewhat large volumes on the same subject hints rather at redundance and a necessity for deciding , like the small brother of the new twins , which we will keep .

		Happily here there is sufficient difference to make such decision unnecessary , and what one seeks in one book is tolerably sure to be found in the other , while even in the very limited field of genuine colonial furniture the illustrations and plates are duplicates in only one instance .

		To the lady all acknowledgements must be made for having upheld the reputation of women as conservators of the raw material , so to speak , of history , -- the tradition , the legend , the old-time scandal , and the fairy tale , -- which on feminine lips lies ever ready for repetition , for the instruction and the edifica - tion of the young .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's raw ma - terial is not exactly legend nor fairy tale , being matter obtained for the most part from inventories , price list proceedings , and law - suits ; but if repetition can accomplish anything she must be considered as one who has acted nobly .

		When nearly two-thirds of the text of a book carry quotation marks it is , even as evidence of mere industry , most impressive , -- and it would be more were it not that when one settles down to read there comes a time when nobility palls , industry palls , and raw material palls , and if the subject is history one has an appetite for something with more in - terpretive value .

		This is where Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	comes in .

		He , without so much repetition , has an equal amount of industry and raw material , having also read all the inventories and bills of sale -- it takes nigh seven years , if we may believe the pros - pectus , -- but instead of extracts from his reading he tells '' in his own words '' a clear connected story of our furniture since the first pilgrim chests , cupboards , chairs , and beds landed on these shores .

		Without pedantry he has contrived to present the historical facts and much special information in a narrative so ♦ The Furniture of Our Forefathers .

		exoteric that the novice can read it as freely as the expert .

		When there is no evidence on a certain point , the fact is stated with a freedom from surmise that is rare even in the best his - torical society ; and on the other hand , where there is evidence it is attached to its object with great clearness .

		In arrangement Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	's book follows the natural division of furniture into chairs , tables , and chests ; all is very orderly and straightforward , and this charm has been still further enhanced by plac - ing the illustrations where they belong -- close to the text they illustrate .

		Taking it all in all , the volume is , I should imagine , the work of one with a well-tempered enthusiasm for his subject , well read and even learned in its his - tory , and willing to treat his learning as what the dramatic critics call reserve force .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	as an historian has no idea of reserve force , but relentlessly insists on ex - hibiting the entire result of her industry ; and with inventories in extenso , letters , diaries , and proceedings , ad .

		lib. , finally creates in a somewhat wearied mind an impression like a read-up lecture .

		The documents that Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	refers to merely .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	quotes almost in their entirety .

		This has still the advantage of being complementary ; so that if to anyone the method of '' Colonial Furniture in
America	LOCATION	'' appears sketchy he can take up '' The Furniture of our Forefathers '' and verify each and every allusion .

		On the mechanical side , however , in the number and magnificence of the illustrations and the general '' get up '' of the book .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	has a production that is really grand .

		Not only the number of the plates , but their variety also , are unusual , two of them , -- the kitchen of the
Hancock	PERSON	-
Clarke	PERSON	house at
Lexington	LOCATION	, which is arranged as a kitchen museum , and the kitchen of the
Whipple	PERSON	house at
Ipswich	LOCATION	, -- being easily the most interesting things in either book .

		Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	has n't so many pictures , but he has had the advantage of a clear aim to aid him in writing his book .

		This , as given in the earlier announcements , was to write a history of furniture in
America	LOCATION	with precise informa - tion on certain points , -- such as the evidences of age , periods , and authorship , so that all who buy may read .

		Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	is to be con - gratulated first on his clear aim , and secondly on the scholarship and ability which enabled him to achieve it , and the public is to be con - gratulated on Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	.

		The tendency of the collector to endow his collection with a value out of proportion is occasionally evident ,

		THE DIAL 201 but we still have to wait for an enthusiast who can say , like Nanki-Poo , '' It is true that I adore with a passion that 's intense , But one ought not to ignore all the rules of common sense . ''

		It is rather a disappointment to find in both books that Colonial Furniture has always been so sophisticated -- except for a few interesting objects which , being sheer utilities first , last , and all the time , do not bore one with aesthetic minauderies .

		With the objects which have a merely useful reason for existence one gets a pioneer flavor which is lacking in the stuff im - ported from
London	LOCATION	for honorific purposes .

		Looking back , the antiquity of many modern ideas is astonishing , some of them being an - cient enough to give distinction even to the
Society	ORGANIZATION	, of which one has heard rumors , com - posed of those whose ancestors were killed in folding beds .

		There are of course plenty of histories of furniture already , but these two present the subject in the modern and sym - pathetic garb .

		Presuming that it is a some - what diiB & cult matter to treat interestingly , that it was necessary to treat it at all , and that the publications are something more than apropos of the
Colonial Eenaissance of Grand Rapids	ORGANIZATION	, then we may consider that the subject of American furniture has been well attended to .

Chicago	LOCATION	:

		By served the country as a diplomat in
Europe	LOCATION	, and on his return to this country became a lecturer on International Law at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the last edition of his work appeared in
1866	DATE	, and a new and exhaustive American treatise on the subject was much needed .

		To meet this need Hon.
Hannis Taylor	PERSON	has written his treatise on '' International Public Law . ''

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	became favorably known through the publication in
1889	DATE	of his scholarly work on '' The Origin and Growth of the English Constitution . ''

		That work clearly demonstrated that its author possessed scholarship and ability .

		In
1893	DATE	Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	was appointed by
Presi	PERSON	- dent
Cleveland	LOCATION	Minister to
Spain	LOCATION	, and for four years he represented this country with credit at
the Court of Madrid	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is a graduate of
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	.

		That he is fitted by his learning , his ability , his experience as a lawyer and diplomat , to write the work which has just appeared , will be , we think , conceded .

		It will also be conceded that
Whea	PERSON	- ton 's treatise is the only work which has been written in this country with which Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's work can be compared .

		President
Woolsey	PERSON	's work , a most scholarly and valuable one , and one most properly held in very high esteem at home and abroad , was not intended to be as full and comprehensive as
Wheaton 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's work was undoubtedly intended to supplant
Wheaton	PERSON	's , and has been written on as comprehensive a plan .

		The author has every reason to expect that his work will be recognized as a standard authority , and will be consulted in this country as
Wheaton	LOCATION	here - tofore has been .

		No book written nearly seventy years ago , however well written it may be , can hold its place as against a book reasonably well written and on an equally comprehensive plan , and which brings the subject down to the present time .

		Wheaton 's book would have been displaced long ago had it not been for his accomplished editors , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	and Mr.
Laurence	PERSON	, whose valuable annotations made a new work on the subject unnecessary until recently .

		In saying that
Wheaton	PERSON	's work will be '' displaced '' by
Taylor	PERSON	's we do not mean to convey the impression that
Wheaton	PERSON	will no longer be consulted .

		His opinions will no doubt be cited for years to come , as are the opinions of Grotius ,
Vattel	ORGANIZATION	,
Burlamayin	LOCATION	,
Bluntschli	PERSON	,
Bynkershoek	LOCATION	, and others .

		The publicist will continue to cite
Wheaton	LOCATION	as the lawyer con - tinues to cite
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	and Kent .

		But
Taylor	PERSON	's work is one which every publicist in the
United States	LOCATION	will find it necessary to have 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, on his shelves , and he will examine it when - ever he is in doubt as to the international usage of to-day on any given question .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has written an excellent book , and one which meets a decided want .

		He has done his work in a scholarly way and his trea - tise is indispensable to every American pub - licist .

		He has not , however , produced a work which can for a moment be compared with the great work of
Calvo	PERSON	's ; it is only fair to say that he did not attempt to .

		In
1868	DATE	M.
Carlos Calvo	PERSON	published his great work in Spanish under the title of
Derecho International Teo	ORGANIZATION	- rlco y
Practico de Europa y America	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was afterwards translated into French as Le
Droit International Theorique et Pratique	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is regarded in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	as the leading treatise in existence on the subject of International Law .

		It is much to be regretted that no English translation of this most im - portant work has ever made its appearance .

		Such a translation should have been made long before this .

		The definition which Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	gives of International Law is as follows : '' The aggre - gate of rules regulating the intercourse of states , which have been gradually evolved out of the moral and intellectual convictions of the civil - ized world as the necessity for their existence has been demonstrated by experience '' -LRB- p. 86 -RRB- .

		Again he says -LRB- p. 167 -RRB- that International Law '' is a system of rules created by civilized nations , since the beginning of the
Reforma	LOCATION	- tion , to regulate their intercourse with each other . ''

		In the light of his definition he tells us that the relation of international to natural law loses its importance .

		The importance of the relation depends wholly upon the view one entertains as to what really constitutes
Inter	ORGANIZATION	- national Law .

		English writers insist that the only source of International Law is actual usage , and that no principle can be said to be a part of International Law until it has been actually incorporated into the usages of
States	LOCATION	.

		This is the theory of Hall ,
Laurence	PERSON	, and
Walker	PERSON	, -- all English writers .

		This was the theory advanced by Lord
Russell	PERSON	, afterwards Chief Justice of
England	LOCATION	, in his argument be - fore the Tribunal of Arbitration at
Paris	LOCATION	, in
1893	DATE	, in the case between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	respecting the Fur Seals .

		He there declared : '' The phrase of Grotius , placuit ne gentibus , sums up the only possible and the only true idea of the law of nations ; and when text-writers and theorists and dip - lomatists assert that such and such a usage is recognized by the law of nations , that such and such a right exists under the law of nations , in each case the criterion is not whether the rule so expressed , or the usage or the right so asserted , is humane , or is just , or is moral ; the sole question is whether it has received the assent and consent of civilized nations : placuit ne gentibus f '' This theory finds support in the judgments pronounced by
Lord Chief Justice Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	and his associates in the
Franconia	LOCATION	case .

		* The counsel for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	, Mr.
James C. Carter	PERSON	, advanced a different theory , and cited in support of it the American writers on the
Law of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, and some of the earlier English writers .

		His statement was that in determining in what International Law consisted we were to look to two sources : 1 .

		The practices and usages of nations ; 2 .

		The law of nature .

		He said : '' The points in which nations come into connection with each other , or into collision with each other , are comparatively few , and therefore the occasions for the study , the development , and the application of the law of nations have , in the course of history , been com - paratively few .

		For the most part , therefore , when new questions arise we are referred at once to the law of nature , which is the true source upon which the whole system of the law of nations rests ; and these we are entitled to and to take as law , the plain deductions of right reason from admitted principles , unless we find that those plain deductions have , somewhere or some - how , been disavowed by the nations of the earth in their actual intercourse with each other . ''

		And Mr.
Justice Harlan	PERSON	, who was one of the arbitrators , declared his opinion that '' True wisdom , indeed the Treaty and public law , I submit , require that this Tribunal accept the doctrine that whatever is demanded by right reason , justice , and morality has the sanction of the law of nations , unless it has been otherwise determined by the general assent of mankind . ''

		t It would be absurd to suppose that Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	is unaware of this discussion at
Paris	LOCATION	, although he has nothing to say about it .

		The question raised is fundamental and a matter of the greatest possible importance , and his attempt to dispose of the subject by his definition of International Law , and the declaration that in the light of his definition the relation of Inter - national Law to Natural Law loses its import - ance , is anything but satisfying .

		On some of the topics which he treats Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has not been as full and explicit as is desirable .

		Take , for example , the subject of reciprocity treaties .

		Does the treaty-making power confer on the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and President the right to make commercial treaties and thereby fix duties , regulate commerce , and raise revenue without the concurrence of the

		To be sure , he says that it only refers to gratuitous privileges , and does not cover privileges granted on the condition of a reciprocal advantage -LRB- p. 375 -RRB- .

		But this is not entirely satisfactory , and if it were it would have been well to have made mention of the course pursued by Ger - many in
1875	DATE	in its construction of the clause in our treaty with
Hawaii	LOCATION	.

		The fears of some Congressmen at the present time that if we do our plain duty by making concessions to
Cuba	LOCATION	by way of tariff reductions , we shall have trouble with other nations having treaties with us which contain the '' most favored nation '' clause , only serves to show that there is con - siderable ignorance abroad as to what the clause means .

		That ignorance , we fear , is not likely to be much dispelled by anything Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has to say .

		In making mention of American writers on International Law the author -LRB- pp. 68 and 69 -RRB- makes no mention of Gallaudet or
Gardner	PERSON	.

		Neither of these writers made any great con - tribution to the literature of the subject , but they are as deserving of mention as some the author has named .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	sympathises with Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's Venezuelan Message of
December 17 , 1895	DATE	, and so , for that matter , does his critic .

		He speaks of Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	as '' a resolute and far-sighted statesman , '' and that such is to be the verdict of history seems pretty well assured .

		The
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, he says , is purely a creation of the executive power , and is to be classed with those sources of international law which rest upon instructions given by States for the guidance of their own courts and officers .

		In Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's opinion
Great Britain	LOCATION	by accept - ing arbitration of the Venezuelan Question has admitted that the
United States	LOCATION	is possessed of the primacy of the New World .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	treats the subject of Intervention quite fully , and justifies this country 's interven - tion in
Cuba	LOCATION	by the general principles of Inter - national Law , and leaving the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	entirely out of view .

		Recent disclosures from
Berlin	LOCATION	make it plain that the representatives of the Powers at
Washington	LOCATION	did not believe that the
United States	LOCATION	, after the receipt of the Spanish note of
April 10	DATE	, was justified in in - tervening .

		Notwithstanding the minor criticisms in which the writer has indulged , -- and any work , no matter how carefully done , is always liable to such criticisms , -- it is only fair to say that Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's work is a notable contribution to the literature of International Law , and that it will be welcomed by public men in
England	LOCATION	as well as in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has completed his task in an admirable manner , and his book is really deserving of praise .

		Here and there we wish he had gone more into detail and been more specific .

		But the merits of the book greatly outweigh its minor defects , and it will undoubtedly long be recognized as a standard authority on International Law .

		* There is no such country , politically , as Ar - menia .

		But there is a section of
Asia	LOCATION	now ruled by at least two powers , which was form - erly , and is now in part , occupied by Armenians .

		This territory lies between
Asia Minor	ORGANIZATION	on the west , the Caspian Sea on the east , and between the Black Sea and the river Kur on the north and northeast , and
Persia	LOCATION	and
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	on the south .

		It is traversed by some of the most picturesque of mountain ranges , and is the source of some great rivers , such as the Tigris and
Euphrates	LOCATION	.

		Its valleys and table-lands are pitched amid some of the grandest of moun - tain scenery , and are watered by the purest of springs and streams .

		Mr.

1890	DATE	in
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	, and was quite familiar with the customs of this portion of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Drawn by curiosity largely , he thoroughly equipped himself , and set out to make a comprehensive study of this country and its people .

		He admits , too , in the course of his discussions , that he was greatly interested to see how the Armenian problem appeared from an inside study .

		This led him to investi - gate carefully the condition of the population in each considerable city that he traversed .

		The first volume deals with the Kussian provinces of
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		The author sailed up the Black Sea , making an extensive stop at
Trebizond	ORGANIZATION	, and landed at
Batum	LOCATION	, the western terminus of the Russian railway .

		Thence he entered Russian territory , crossing by stage into the Kur valley .

		The most notable halts in his next journey in the Araxes valley were
Alex	PERSON	- andropol ,
Erivan	PERSON	, Ani , and
Kars	LOCATION	.

		Each of these , and many smaller places , he examined with great care , looking especially into the schools , the churches , the character of the popu - lation , and the ruins .

		Of some places , such as
Kars	LOCATION	and Ani , he goes into great descriptive detail , and gives a mass of useful information , the result both of others ' investigations and his own .

		In some chapters , such as
XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- pp. 228 - 315 , on the Armenian Church -RRB- , he gives long studies of historical interest , touching the Ar - menian peoples and their history .

		In connection with the chapter on Ani , we have an admirable summary , from the best sources , of '' the Ar - menian kingdom of the Middle Ages . ''

		The most inspiring part of this volume is the de - scription of Mt. Ararat and the party 's ascent of it -- to an altitude of 16,916 feet .

		The writer 's energetic style , and his admirably-taken photographs , carry the reader along with the party .

		The large map of
Armenia	LOCATION	also adds greatly to the vividness of impression made by the narrative .

		Volume II .

		deals with Mr.
Lynch	PERSON	's expe - riences in the Turkish provinces of
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		Having crossed the backbone of the
Aghri Dagh	PERSON	range of mountains , he went direct to Van , with its wonderful lake , fortress , and dead crater .

		There is no more interesting spot in all
Armenia	LOCATION	than Lake Van and its sur - roundings .

		The author took careful measure - ments , examined sites , and gives us an admirable summary of his results .

		We are glad to see that he notes with full credit the investigations of the German Assyriologists ,
Belck	PERSON	and Leh - mann , in this region within the
last decade	DATE	.

		These scholars established several facts in re - gard to the relation of
Assyria	LOCATION	to this country in the most prosperous period of the Ninevite empire .

		Erzerum , the strongest fortress in
Turkish Armenia	LOCATION	, receives large attention both for its local and for its political importance .

		It is practically the key to this section of Ar - menia , and its capture by
Russia	LOCATION	at any time would mean the loss to
Turkey	LOCATION	of this great region .

		Some of the author 's diary notes are not of special interest to the reader , but such can be easily passed by , and he can go on to the de - scriptions of localities , of mountain ranges , and to his studies of geographical , political , and historical subjects .

		One chapter -LRB- XXIV . -RRB-

		of the second volume is a graphical summary of the statistical and political status of
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		On the basis of the best statistics at command , he finds in
Turkish Armenia	LOCATION	387,746 Armenians , and in the Russian provinces 906,984 , being about one-third of the whole population of the former district , and nearly two-fifths in the latter .

		We are glad to find in the Appendix the '' National Constitution of the Armenians in the Turkish Empire , '' which was granted by the Porte in
1862	DATE	.

		The Bibliography of twenty-six pages is all one could wish for a full study of
Armenia	LOCATION	, historically , ecclesiastically , politically , or geo - graphically , including even the philological study of the Vannic inscriptions .

		The tinted photographs and the many plans and charts that fill up the volumes make a splendid equip - ment for a popular study of some of the urgent problems presented to-day by the peoples of

		While hysteria pre - sents certain fairly well definable groups of symp - toms , yet these appear in protean variability , to be recognized only by the expert ; and in the end the interpretation of the symptoms themselves depends upon the central psychological conception of the malady .

		A peculiar and interesting enfeeblement of the faculty of psychological synthesis , a weak - ness of the will , a contraction of the field of con - sciousness ; a suppression of certain of the sensory stimuli by the fact that consciousness is not at home to them ; a consequent favoring of a tendency toward a dissolution of the personality and the formation of parasitic groups of ideas , -- these are some of the psychological generalizations which bring under a provisional unity the endless series of symptoms which hysteria reveals .

		Chivalry , '' by Mr.
H. Warre Cor	PERSON	- nish , is the sixth published volume in the '' Social England Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Noting the title of the series , one naturally expects to find a treatment of chivalry as ■ developed in
England	LOCATION	; and it is somewhat sur - prising to find that the material on
England	LOCATION	, if abstracted , would amount to not more than an eighth of the book .

		It is true that the ceremonies of chivalry took slight hold in
England	LOCATION	; yet it would be possible to take the contemporary life of conti - nental
Europe	LOCATION	as a background , and deal with English chivalry , such as it was , more in detail .

		This is our first serious criticism .

		Three other faults are conspicuous , since they detract from the value of the book as a work of reference : there are numerous quotations from Old French and Old English , with scattering ones from other languages , which should be translated in notes or appendix ; there should be a glossary of obsolete words , and of terms peculiar to the science of heraldry , etc. ; there is no index .

		In spite of these defects , how - ever , and of a lack of clearness in the author 's style , the book contains much information valuable and interesting to the '' general reader , '' the peruser of historical novels , and the student who is not a specialist but who wishes a sketch of social life during one of the most fascinating periods of the world 's history .

		Take it all in all , a fairly comprehensive picture is here presented of life among the upper classes from the eleventh to the sixteenth century .

		Knighthood , with its attendant panoply and cir - cumstance , was the mainspring ; the virtues of History of chivalry in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		honor , courage , pride , liberality , love of ladies were the ruling principles .

		The Crusades strength - ened the order of knighthood and supplied a mo - tive .

		When the Crusades ceased , chivalry became more and more a mere form and ceremonial , and gradually died out .

		That its principles were fre - quently violated , goes almost without saying ; and it is equally true that its standards of purity and justice were not ours , and that along with their virtues the knights had faults which show them as partly savages .

		Nevertheless , chivalry , by means of the crusades , by means of the literature it brought forth , by means of the new ideals it brought to rude and warlike men , left its mark for good on all later history .

		This Mr.
Cornish	PERSON	proves conclusively , opposing himself to those students of history who '' can see nothing in chivalry but the exaggeration of the military spirit , a childish cere - monialism , and the degradation of the family by an unnatural code of gallantry . ''

		The book contains many interesting illustrations , reproduced from old prints .

		The famous
Siena	LOCATION	, unfortunately , does not lie art-pavement directly upon the most frequented at
Stena	ORGANIZATION	.

		routes of Italian travel , and has been unreasonably slighted by tourists and little visited save by the adventurous .

		Hence scant justice has been done to the contributions she is capable of making to art history .

		The Duomo is but a tran - sept of the building projected in the eleventh cen - tury , when
Siena	LOCATION	was in her prime , -- a formidable rival of
Florence	LOCATION	, -- and wanted to build a cathedral that would be second to none in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But she suffered irreparably in the great plague of
1348	DATE	; and the following year , abandoning the plans for the building she wanted and contenting herself with the building she had -LRB- which is yet thought by competent critics the most beautiful in
Italy	LOCATION	-RRB- , she began the ornamentation of that , and succeeded in making it especially rich in art treasures .

		It has frescos attributed to Pinturricchio after designs by
Raphael	PERSON	, choir-stalls and intarsia work by
Giovanni da Verona	ORGANIZATION	, a sculptured monument supposed to be by
Michel Angelo	PERSON	, besides paintings by artists who made forever famous the Sienese School of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries .

		But , most important of all , it has '' The Pavement . ''

		The floor of the entire structure presents a scheme of pictures not altogether Christian or religious , but extremely interesting , and particularly so to the student of art archaeology .

		It differs from ordinary mosaic -LRB- excepting in one panel -RRB- , and belongs to a class of work that '' seems to have been peculiar to the artistic mind of the Sienese . ''

		There are only three other similar pavements in existence , and of these two are in
Siena	LOCATION	and the third is in
Lucca	LOCATION	, not a hundred miles distant .

		This Duomo pavement is made the subject of an illustrated volume of 155 pages , by
Robert H. Hobart Cast	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, on '' The Pavement Masters of
Siena	LOCATION	, '' to serve as the initial volume of a series of ' ^ Handbooks of the Great 206 THE DIAL -LSB-

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There were fifty-four '' Pavement Masters , '' including those who in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have worked upon the restoration of the original designs .

		Of some of the fifty-four , absolutely nothing is known but that they did their work and received their pay .

		Most of them are unknown to fame , but at least two of them -- Matteo di Giovanni and Do - menico Beccaf umi -- have high places in the '' fair and luminous record '' of the Sienese school of art .

		The chapter Mr.
Oust	PERSON	devotes to these workers evinces very careful researches among the archives of the Cathedral ; and not only is the volume a valuable contribution to popular art history , but it whets the reader 's appetite for the forthcoming issues of the series .

		`` The Making of a Country Home '' For the man who -LRB- Doubledav -RRB- records the successful wants a home .

		^ , • ' ' , , .

		.

		i experiment of a man who was tired of endlessly camping out in a flat that cost a fourth of his income , and willing to undergo all sorts of temporary deprivations and discouragements for the sake of the final recompense , a real home of his own .

		How he and his wife -- who , if not always quite of his mind , loved him enough to trust in him -- surrendered gentility for two years that they might later go house-hunting through the environs of
New York City	LOCATION	, and how , having made their choice , they transformed it into the veritable home beautiful of their dreams , is the theme of the book .

		The affair is related as it happened , -- so the author assures us , -- with no fictitious glamour of romance to delude the young couple who may haply be tempted to go and do likewise ; and from a literary as well as from a practical point of view , it is this pervasive note of reality that constitutes the charm of the story .

		A country lawyer , a Swedish maid , a pair of lovers who meet and woo under the new vine and fig-tree , a married couple who scoff at life in a cottage and make their own disastrous attempt to escape from the same humdrum round that dis - mayed the hero and heroine , -- all these add variety to the main thread of the narrative .

		But the real value of the book lies in its suggestive and yet definite answer to a question that must come some - time to every man with a small income and a family : '' How , if we keep on renting a house , are we ever going to have a home ? ''

		Every such man will appreciate '' The Making of a Country Home . ''

		John 's ideals may not be his , but they will at least set him to thinking and perhaps inspire him to act for himself .

		In Mr.
Arthur Kenyon Rogers	PERSON	's '' Student 's History of Philosophy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we can without exag - geration welcome what is , on the whole , a good and useful textbook .

		It will prove helpful to col - lege classes of not very advanced standing , as also to the general reader who is taking his first some - what uncertain steps along the path of philosophic knowledge .

		That the number of readers of the A help/ul history of philosophy .

		latter class will scarcely be less than that of the former is apparent from the ever increasing ten - dency of broad-minded men and women to seek the origin and connection of present-day thoughts and problems in and with those of the past , since ideas no less than events have their history .

		The sim - pler and less abstruse such a presentation is , the greater , of course , will be its aid and the more effective the introduction it can afford to the books of larger scope and more specific character .

		That the subject sometimes revenges itself , as it were , on the author for treating weighty matters so lightly , and breaking the edge of their obscurity so com - pletely -LRB- in response to the needs of inexperienced minds -RRB- , is seen in his occasionally falling into the habit of offering explanations that are no whit clearer than the thesis , and in his frequent relapse into a hasty conversational style that is chatty when compared with the utterances of the old sages whom he quotes and whose every phrase is sur - charged with meaning that seems to mock the pov - erty of words .

		But while Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	's book can in no way compare with , for example ,
Windel	PERSON	- band 's exact and learned work , it should neverthe - less be judged on its own merits ; and among these we count its conquest of the practical difficulties of the case , which are not small .

		They are here met not only by great familiarity with the ideas pre - sented , but also by an individual mode of present - ing them , by general accuracy in treatment , by a happy habit of quoting extensively from the philos - ophers , and by an earnestness that lets no problem drop until it has to some extent been viewed from all sides .

		In our opinion , the author is most suc - cessful where he treats of problems that touch upon our modern ideas of life and the world , where he naturally has more light to guide him .

		He is less convincing when he portrays the remoter life of the mind ; but in this he shares the fate of many of his kind .

		On the whole it may be said that while the defects of the book may to some extent mar the enjoyment of it to those who are already far advanced in philosophic study , these defects would not generally interfere with its usefulness to those whom it especially strives to benefit .

		Among these names ,
Landseer	PERSON	's , not one of the greatest , was certainly one of the most popular ; he chose his subjects from every - day life , he knew how to tell a story with his brush , and he won the heart of the English-speaking world .

		Much greater artists may well envy him his unique fame .

		-- The tenth volume of the same series is given to

Dooley	PERSON	's opin - ions rank in many quarters above those of the
United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		All in all , Mr.
Dooiey	PERSON	has a better i ^ avor than the Fables .

		It is not only that brogue is more lovable and more forgivable than slang ; Dooiey on the whole `` makes for righteousness , '' while the satire of the Fables gives a sub-cynical reaction when held in a current of fresh air .

		Both writers reflect phases of contem - porary life that will escape the novelist and the historian ; but
Dooley	PERSON	's is a magic mirror that shows behind the picture of unhappy things that are a shadowy image of what ought to be .

		Mr.
Ade	PERSON	's studies of the vulgar female man-hunter , the hypo - critical `` leading citizen , '' the variegated `` dead - beat , '' the empty-pated '' Chawley-boy , '' and their kin ought , indeed , to disgust , as do the pictures of
Hogarth	PERSON	's '' Rake 's Progress , '' but there is not a little danger that incipient members of these groups will think the types intended for heroes .

		Mr.
Dooiey	PERSON	, to be sure , is keener and gentler and fairer than the dispenser of '' five cints ' worth iv flude exthract iv hell f ' r fifteen cints '' on Archey Road could possibly be ; but we are more willing to have a man rise above himself than to sink below .

		The Rev.

		The book is a presentation , in narrative form , of the history , so - called , of the Hebrews from the beginning down to the Roman period .

		The narrow limits of 324 pages made this a hazardous undertaking .

		Upon an ex - amination of the author 's method of compressing his material to fit this space , we discover the expected defects .

		He has attempted too much .

		If he had satisfied himself by introducing fewer unsolved problems and unanswered questions , the book would have been more readable and less discouraging to the bulk of readers .

		Since he has introduced many such problems , at least comparative completeness required that he should have given the best answers that modern scholarship proposes , thus considerably enlarging the work .

		As it is ,
Kittel	PERSON	's work -- which he closely follows , especially in the patriarchal and nomadic stages of
Israel	LOCATION	's history -- is quite superior to the condensed book before us .

		If the reader is already familiar with the outline facts of the He - brew history , he will find these twelve chapters an orderly arrangement of that matter , though pre - senting nothing strikingly new .

		The book is sup - plied with seven well-executed maps , done by

		There are many thousands of Americans who will be grieved to learn of the death on
March 5	DATE	, in his Surrey home , at the age of sixty-nine , of
Benjamin Franklin Stevens	PERSON	.

		Although he had made
England	LOCATION	his place of residence -LRB- and of his business -RRB- since
1860	DATE	, he had re - mained in close touch with the life of his native coun - try , through his official function as United States Despatch Agent , his constant relations with American libraries , and his work for American historical scholar - ship .

		He was , in a way , the leader of the American colony in
London	LOCATION	, and the fellow-countrymen who par - took of his generous hospitality and profited by his friendly services remember him with grateful affection .

		Like his brother , the late
Henry Stevens	PERSON	, he was a Green Mountain Boy by birth , although he did not join in the whimsical affectation of the former by adding
G. M. B.	PERSON	to the list of his titles .

		His series of fac - similes of historical manuscripts and other laborious publications , earned for him the deepest respect of American historians , and remain as the lasting memo - rial of his active and useful career .

$ 1.00	MONEY	net .

		In `` The New World and the New Thought '' Dr.
James T. Bixby	PERSON	calls attention to the immense expansion of the universe in space and time and the radical reconstruction of our ideas as to its nature and government , due to modern discoveries .

		If faith is to hold its ground there is required an analogous enlargement in our religious conceptions and radical modifications in the popular theology .

		The author , bow - ever , does not dwell so much on the destructive side of the theme as on the constructive .

		By fresh interpretations and arguments , as rev - erent as they are reasonable and scientific , he shows that modem knowledge may supply new confidence in the
Divine Existence and Personality	ORGANIZATION	, a stronger sanction for morals , more inspiring views of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and a more effective Christianity .

		The reasoning is profound and original , its handling logical and strong , the style and illustrations clear and attractive ; and its frankness and philosophic insight into some of the knottiest problems of the day distinguish it as a volume of unusual timeliness and notable merit .

		It is easy enough for men to agree that Jesus Christ approved only that which is right , and condemned only that which is wrone .

		The real problem lies in the question , What does he approve and what does he condemn in our present d '' y life ?

		The only way to get at this is to extract the bottom principles from his words and life and then apply them .

		In fifty-four brief studies Mr.
Speer	PERSON	gives us not only conclusions but a method and a model for the pursuit ot practical moral questions .

		The book is full of both life and Scripture , and will make a capital text book for Bible classes as well as furnishing a stimulant for individual reading .

		NOTES 253 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 254 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 254 HISTORIES OF LITERATURE .

		It is something of a paradox that , while lit - erature itself is the most interesting product of human effort , the histories of literature are among the dullest books there are .

		Why , it may reasonably be argued , should not the charm of the subject lend itself in some measure to the treatment , and why should not books about literature have in themselves a literary value ?

		Of course , our paradoxical proposition must not be taken in too sweeping a sense .

		When a great writer undertakes to deal with literary history , the product will be literature as in - evitably as if it were a novel or a poem .

		But writers who have the creative endowment are almost sure to exercise it upon the material shaped by imagination , leaving the material of history proper to be the prey of the plodder and the pedant .

		These worthy gentry -LRB- perhaps from the instinct of self-preservation -RCB- do their best to keep genius from poaching upon the domain of history , and , since genius is more frequently shy than aggressive , it is easily frightened away .

		Let a
Froude	PERSON	or a Taine encamp himself within the sacred precincts of historical scholarship , and straightway the combined forces of scientific method and dry - as-dust investigation are arrayed against the unwelcome intruder ; he is given the counsel proverbially aimed at over-venturesome cob - blers , and is reminded , with pedagogical sever - ity , of his notorious delinquencies .

		Thus it is that history falls almost wholly into the hands of writers who have the sober virtues of industry , and accuracy , and logical analysis , while almost wholly lacking the bril - liant virtues of style and ideal outlook and rich emotional appeal .

		Even the history of literature more frequently than not suffers this fate , and is left to be recounted by writers who are incapable of making literature on their own account .

		It is , indeed , no easy task to make literary history interesting .

		There are too many names to be mentioned , too many titles of books to be worked in , too many dry facts to be incorporated with the narrative .

		It takes resolution to leave out matters which , in the close view , seem essential , and which appear unimportant only when the point of 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, observation is sufficiently removed to blot out all except the salient features of the man or the period under discussion .

		Taine had the resolution to do this , and the power to make literature out of the treatment of literary his - tory ;
Symonds	PERSON	had it , and a few others ; Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has it in a remarkable degree ; but most writers upon the subject are hopelessly without it , and , if they seek to be literary at all , take refuge in the graceful phrases and the vague philosophies of dilettantism .

		There are two devices by which the history of literature may be made attractive to a wide circle of readers , even when undertaken by an uninspired critic .

		One of them is by the copious use of pictorial illustrations of the text .

		This device has long found favor in dealing with the history of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literatures , but has been strangely ignored by English bookmakers .

		There are sumptuously illustrated histories of the literatures of
Germany	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	, and
Norway	LOCATION	, and their example should have received imitation long ago by some pub - lisher in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	.

		We under - stand that such a work is at last to be brought out in
England	LOCATION	, under the editorship of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, and we shall await its appearance with much interest .

		The other device is that of frankly making the history a collection of rep - resentative extracts , with just enough of nar - rative and critical discussion to provide a connecting medium .

		Such a history is sug - gestive of a plum-pudding , and consists mostly of plums , the matrix in which they are im - bedded having little distinctive taste of its own .

		The most prosaic of writers , if only he have a pretty taste in reading , can make an attractive book of this type , and such books are well worth making , if for no other reason than that they stimulate their readers to further investi - gation in the right direction .

		We have been led to make the foregoing remarks by the reappearance , in twentieth cen - tury guise , of '' Chambers 's Cyclopaedia of En - glish Literature . ''

		The good old book which has borne that name for sixty years has had a useful career .

		It began to appear in
1842	DATE	, was revised and brought down to date in
1858	DATE	, was again revised and extended in
1876	DATE	, and still again in
1888	DATE	.

		The present form is there - fore the fourth of its reincarnations , and is almost as unlike the first edition as the latest form of ''
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary '' is unlike the earlier ones .

		There are to be three volumes in place of the traditional two , and huge vol - umes they will be , if we may judge by the one already issued by the Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	, for it fills no less than eight hundred and thirty - two double-columned pages .

		Dr.
David Patrick	PERSON	is the editor of this reissued and practically remoulded work , and he has profited by the collaboration of a number of the most eminent English scholars .

		The objects of the undertaking , as set forth by the present editor , have been as follows .

		The work '' is not , and is not meant to be , an anthology of the perfect models of our prose and verse , a chrestomathy of purple patches ^ a collection of elegant extracts .

		The acknowl - edged gem should be there , if a man is mainly known by some one noble passage , one sonnet , one song , one aphorism or sententious saying ; but something there should be , as a rule , to illustrate his average achievement , the standard by which he may fairly be judged .

		Nor doea the work profess to be a marrow of our liter - ature , or to give the spirit and quintessence of the several authors ; still less does it aim to render its readers independent of the authors themselves or relieve them from the duty and pleasure of studying the original works .

		In no case will one rise from articles of ours flat - tering himself that now he knows his author and may consider that subject settled . ''

		With these objects in view , the selection of passages seems to us highly judicious , and we are glad to note that , in addition to portrait illustrations , a few facsimiles of famous manuscripts have been inserted .

		In point of scholarship , the new '' Chambers ' * leaves little to be desired .

		It has taken account of the latest work of English and American students ; it has multiplied the space formerly devoted to Old and
Middle English	LOCATION	, and this first volume alone gives treatment to over fifty authors barely mentioned before , if at all .

		The signed special contributions are so important that they must be mentioned .

		The Rev. Stop - ford
Brooke	PERSON	has written of Old English liter - ature .

		Mr.
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	has dealt with the
Middle Period	ORGANIZATION	, with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	, and the English Bible .

		Spenser and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	have fallen , respectively , into the hands of Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- mund
Gosse	PERSON	and Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has written of the Ballads , the late
S. R. Gardiner	PERSON	of the Civil War and the Common - wealth , Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	of the Restoration , and Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	of
Dryden	PERSON	.

		The bulk of the work , of course , has been done by Mr.
Patrick	PERSON	's editorial staff , and a special tribute is paid to '' the accurate scholarship , the keen insight , the incisive style '' of the late
Francis	PERSON	1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233
Hindes Groome	PERSON	, who had an important share in the work .

		The first volume ends with the seventeenth century .

		The two remaining centuries will fill the other two volumes , and we learn with satis - faction that eminent living authors will be in - cluded .

		Nor will
America	LOCATION	be neglected , for the worthies of our own literature will take their proper places in the chronological ar - rangement , and will , generally speaking , be discussed by American critics .

		This is as it should be , and we may close this article by an appropriate quotation from the general preface to the work . ''

		As the English tradition has remained dominant in the Constitution of the nation and the life of the people , our kindred both by lineage and language , so American literature has remained an offshoot , a true branch of English literature .

		In this work it has from the beginning been treated as an integral and important part of the literature of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		We do not look on Long - fellow or
Poe	PERSON	as foreigners , or read the his - tories of
Prescott	PERSON	,
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, and
Parkman	PERSON	as if written by strangers . ''

		ON THE LITERARY DECLINE OF HISTORY .

		Not many months ago the writer had occasion to read a book-review , the chief burden of which was a rather naively-expressed lament concerning the alleged decline of historical writing as literature in these latter days .

		The very interesting question , though hardly a new one , was raised as to why we have no contemporary
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	,
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	,
Gibbon	PERSON	, or
Hallam	PERSON	, -- why there is now no Macaulay to write history in a manner so fascinating as to crowd the latest novel off my lady 's table .

		A complete answer , even were it possible , would involve a mul - titude of considerations , and would far transcend the limits of space at our present disposal ; but it may not be profitless to venture a few suggestions .

		That there has been a decline in historical writ - ing , as judged by the canons of great literature , some might possibly deny , but the most of us would readily concede .

		One has but to mention
Herod	PERSON	- otus ,
Thucydides	LOCATION	, and
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, among the ancients ,
Cailyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Gibbon	PERSON	, and
Green	ORGANIZATION	, in days nearer our own , to bring to mind some of the world 's greatest masterpieces of prose writing .

		With these , the works of history produced during the
last quarter-century	DATE	, while almost legion in number , are in but very few cases even comparable as pieces of literary art .

		They may be , and without doubt frequently are , better histories , but they are certainly not so good literature .

		The truth is that the spirit of modern historical writing is very different from that which animated the historian of former ages .

		This change has re - sulted from the rise of the so-called '' scientific '' school of historical students and writers ; and for the rise of this school the doctrine of evolution must be given the ultimate credit .

		Evolution is essentially a method of thought and interpretation , and as such has worked a reconstruction , not merely in biological science , but also in literature , philoso - phy , theology , and history .

		In these latter fields we are not always consciously aware that it is evo - lution that controls .

		But we have breathed the evolution spirit until it has come to give color to all our thought , and we find ourselves speaking con - tinually in its terms , though we might well be at a loss to tell where we learned them .

		The great con - tribution of the doctrine of evolution in every sphere of knowledge which it has touched has been the establishment of principles of relationship and con - tinuity .

		So that just as under its influence we no longer think of geological changes under the time - honored cataclysmic concept , according to which each new epoch was supposed to be wholly unrelated to the one foregoing , so we no longer , at least when at our best , think of historical '' ages '' as isolated from one another and of human life thus broken apart .

		And just as evolution has taught the geologist that if he is really to know his subject he must use materials -- rocks and fossils and soils -- at first hand , and likewise the chemist his test-tubes and reagents , the botanist his plants , and the zoologist his animals , so has it also taught the historian that if he would know the men of any age or country he must not neglect to seek out and study diligently everything they have left behind them .

		He must go back to the sources -- back to dusty manuscripts , sculptured columns , long-buried coins and imple - ments .

		In other words , he must follow the evolu - tionary method of science .

		Hence comes the '' scientific school '' of historians , most eminently represented , amongEnglish-speaking peoples at least , by
Bishop Stubbs	PERSON	and
Samuel Rawson Gardiner	PERSON	.

		The writings of these men easily betray the fact that scholarship , and not literary art , has been the primary consideration .

		Their lan - guage is cold , careful , and concise , scrupulously devoid of rhetorical devices , and hardly calculated to charm the general reader .

		And not only has our best historical writing become less '' literary , '' but the so-called literary historians , especially Car - lyle ,
Macaulay	LOCATION	, and
Gibbon	PERSON	, have been brought into considerable discredit by the modern school .

		We may still read these authors , but we are assured that the history which we get from them will be very distorted and inadequate unless corrected by an acquaintance with the works of those who have written less brilliantly but more truthfully .

		The former historian generally undertook to cover a larger field than the modern .

		A history was deemed of small note unless it presented the im - 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, posing appearance of six , eight , or even a dozen , goodly volumes , and measured off its subject-matter in terms of milleniums .

		To-day the spectacle of a really great historical scholar sitting down to write the entire history of a great people or nation -- much less of civilization in general -- is virtually unknown .

		Except in the case of historical smat - terers who make up in verbosity what they lack in scholarship , there are practically no more attempts at historical writing on so ambitious a scale .

		The writing of history has come to involve such labor in research and such painstaking effort in verification , that , if properly done , the limitations of life pre - clude the exploitation by any one student of more than a contracted period in the life of a single people ; so that
Freeman	PERSON	spends two decades upon the one subject of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	,
Gardiner	PERSON	labors half a life-time upon the Civil War and the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, covering fewer years in the history of
England	LOCATION	than are consumed by the work in his own life ,
Parkman	PERSON	gives his life to the study of the French settlements in
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	concentrates his masterly energies upon the admin - istrations of
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Madison	PERSON	, and Mr.
James F. Rhodes	PERSON	will have to live many years yet in order to complete his history of the
United States	LOCATION	from the Compromise of
1850	DATE	to the first administration of
Grover Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		This ideal of thoroughness permeates all our historical work .

		Not only are the more renowned writers controlled by it , but the historical instruc - tion and investigation in our best colleges and universities testify to its force .

		The key-note of graduate instruction is concentration , the mastery in detail of a limited field , the adding of something , if possible , to the already existing knowledge on the subject investigated .

		And the sort of work which is required of candidates for the doctorate in history is the sort of work which , with few excep - tions , these men will continue to do throughout the remainder of their scholastic careers .

		Now this sort of work , while a distinct gain for historical scholarship , is not conducive to the de - velopment of a fine literary style .

		The form of expression is made entirely subordinate to the sub - ject-matter .

		While no one would dispute that the essential qualities of good prose literature -- clear - ness , precision , and force -- are eminently desir - able in historical as well as any other kind of composition , yet the conscientious historian is so persistently on guard against sweeping generaliza - tions , unwarranted parallels , and other earmarks of '' fine writing , '' that he stands in immediate danger of acting on the principle , if not openly admitting it , that dulness and roughness are virtues in his writing , and all well-sounding phrases and nicely - rounded periods are necessarily snares set by some evil genius to compass his destruction .

		History must be written to-day with the strictest regard for truth , and truth in the minutest detail .

		A thing is to be valued in proportion as it can be absolutely verified .

		The task of the historian , and the weight of responsibility that devolves upon him , has become such that , as Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	facetiously remarks , it is a wonder that the histo - rians who take their business seriously can sleep at night .

		We now demand actually to see history in the process of being written .

		We must have plainly indicated every step which the author has taken in the accomplishment of his work .

		We are no longer at all content to accept his conclusions without at least seeing his method of approach to them .

		The writing of history is thus coming to be more and more a matter of arranging foot-notes and cross-references .

		Literature knows no such demand of verifica - tion , at least of this comparatively petty sort , and employs no such stiff and constraining devices .

		The fundamental prerequisite of all genuine litera - ture is that it be entirely loyal to the truth , -- but truth in the universal , the general , not in the spe - cific .

		Literature exhibits a luxurious carelessness of details which the historian can by no means afford to indulge .

		Imagine the author of the '' Iliad '' -LRB- be he one or many -RRB- citing authorities for his genealogies , his battle-scenes and army-rolls 1 Or Shakespeare detailing in foot-notes the sources from which he drew the character of Shylock , the plot of
Macbeth	LOCATION	, or the story of Antony and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra , and referring to parallel passages in
Greene	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	and Kyd !

		Or
Wordsworth	PERSON	gravely appending to the '' Intimations of Immortality '' a treatise setting forth the most recent results of speculative thought on the probabilities of the future life !

		Yet just such things -- such petty in - consequential things , the litterateur would say -- the historian finds himself more and more under the necessity of doing .

		All this results from the fact that while litera - ture is primarily a matter of feeling , history is pri - marily a matter of knowledge .

		There is feeling in history and knowledge in literature , but the domi - nant elements are the other way .

		Literature , being of the heart as well as of the head , is to be tested by canons of sentiment as well as of fact .

		The question is not , is this statement literally true ?

		or , is this name entirely authentic ?

		or , is this euphonious allusion restrained within the bounds of cold verity ?

		Such considerations are really of slight moment .

		What matters vastly more is whether the given production exhibits the larger and finer qualities of simplicity , beauty , and uni - versality of interest and appeal .

		But with history it is not so ; neither indeed can it be .

		These ques - tions of exact authenticity and scrupulous fidelity to fact , while sometimes very annoying when per - sistently thrust at a piece of fine writing like
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's third chapter , are perfectly legitimate ; and if they can not be satisfactorily answered , the value of the work is irretrievably diminished .

		Of course it is quite possible for all these demands to be faultlessly complied with , and the production

		THE DIAL .

		235 still fall far short of being good history .

		It may be only a dull and unprofitable chronicle .

		It may be wholly lacking in the virile qualities that are indispensable to the vivifying of historical truth .

		History , to be worthy of the name , must not merely be accurate in details , but must also be trustworthy in interpretation of those details .

		When the his - torian has made sure of his facts his work has only been begun .

		The essential must be sifted from the non-essential .

		Motives and influences must be detected , weighed , and adjudged .

		Light must be sought from the sciences tributary to history -- archaeology , philology , geography , and the like , -- and , being found , must be judicially applied to the subject in hand .

		The history of a year or an epoch , of a movement or an institution , must be given its proper setting in the
Weltgeschichte	LOCATION	.

		Failure in these larger requirements would sacrifice at the outset any claim which an historical produc - tion might have to scholarly recognition .

		And besides all this , after the historian has fash - ioned his product with the extremest care and deliberation , he may be sure that , however great its merits , it will not long continue to maintain its place in the favor either of scholars or of the world at large .

		For , on the one hand , new discoveries , new ideas , new interpretations , will inevitably dis - credit more or less of what has been said ; and , on the other , changed tastes and fluctuating interests will demand a re-writing of the old material .

		Ex - cept in cases where it has been the fortune of the historian to become our only medium of knowledge of an age or historical process , there is no such thing as finality in the writing of history .

		In the words of a recent writer on this subject , '' Each generation must write its own history of past events in order to interpret them in terms corresponding to its needs .

		New conditions give rise to new problems , and these to new conceptions ; and when we turn again to examine the past , we put to it questions never before asked . ''

		Just now we are in the age of extreme particu - larism in historical research and writing .

		In our study we are following the method of the anatomist rather than that of the artist .

		We are bent upon details rather than upon the general effect -- dis - secting rather than studying in perspective .

		We are curbing our ambitions and recognizing our limitations as never before .

		We are working under the conviction that a life-time is none too long a time to give to any one of hundreds of brief periods or single phases of the historical field .

		Historical truth is being accumulated and put in imperishable form with unparalleled rapidity and discernment .

		We are too busy collecting the ma - terials for the mosaic , to give much thought to the mosaic itself .

		We are too busy and too '' scien - tific '' to give much thought to the literary quality of the history that we write .

		When all has been said , however , the fact re - mains that history and literature are bound together by ties impossible to be broken .

		Both are concerned primarily with the phenomena of human life , either as it has been or as it might be .

		The mere con - sideration that history deals with this subject on the fact side , and literature on the imaginative side , is not sufficient to set up an impassable barrier between the two .

		Literature continues to be the greatest of all sources of historical knowledge , and history the only adequate basis for the understanding and appreciation of litera - ture .

		When the great fund of historical knowl - edge shall have been more fully brought to light , there will be no inherent reason why historical writing may not take on all the essential qualities of great prose literature ; for it is to be believed that truth is indeed stranger than fiction , and that the illuminating recital of what men have been and what they have done and what they have tried to do can never be greatly surpassed for interest and force by anything that it can enter into the imagi - nation of man to conceive .

		The portrayal of human life , which is the ulti - mate business of the historian , can never be made a mere matter of black-and-white sketching .

		So subtle is life in its ramifications , so intricate in its relationships , so variegated in its meanings and influences , that nothing short of consummate liter - ary skill can adequately present the shades and colors of the picture .

		There is a dead mechanical way of writing history , which as a temporary ex - pedient is all well enough , but there is also a living , artistic , forceful way , which must be taken advantage of when the time becomes ripe for it .

		Our need for literary art in the collection and classification of materials is slight ; but not so when the materials thus gathered are to be given a sane , comprehensive , and illuminating interpretation .

		Some day there will set in a movement to coor - dinate the results of our specialized effort , and then may be expected to appear once more the literary historian .

		Scholarship will not be less valued , nor truth less highly regarded ; but the art of present - ing truth will be given more attention .

		Noth - ing short of a transcendent genius , however , can ever again fill the place of the genuine literary historian .

		From our conscientious devotion to truth in the minute we shall never wholly recover ; and of all historical writing we shall continue to demand absolute accuracy of detail , -- a standard which was unknown to
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	,
Livy	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus the necessities which the literary historian of the future will have to meet grow greater with every passing day .

		PHONETICS AND SPELLING REFORM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Little attention has been given to the effect that a study of the modern science of phonetics has had upon the agitation for spelling reform , so called ; yet , prop - erly understood , almost the entire case of the reformers seems to be put out of court by the results of the recent labors of phoneticians like Mr ,
Henry Sweet	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Alexander Melville Bell	PERSON	.

		Striking at the very root of the matter is the dis - closure that , the principal advocates of spelling reform being philologists , it is not they , but the phoneticians , who are specialists in the premises sought to be occu - pied ; and , not being specialists , the philologists who are chiefly responsible for such contrivances as the '' scientific alphabet '' of the American Philological As - sociation are , partially at least , outside of this particular province of learning .

		Just what this signifies will be taken up in more detail directly .

		The publication of the '' Oxford '' dictionary discloses certain growing tendencies on the part of both American and British speech to vary from a common standard of English .

		Comparing the '' scientific alphabet '' referred to above with the '' Key to the Pronunciation '' in Dr.
Murray	PERSON	's and Mr.
Henry Bradley	PERSON	's great word-book , the differences are remarkable in several cases .

		The alphabet gives the sound of a in care and tare as the long sound of the a in fat and fan ; the key gives the vowel sound in there and pare as the long sound of the vowel in yet and ten .

		The alphabet gives the name sound of i as compounded of the a in ask and the i in it -RRB- the key , as made up of the obscure sound heard in the last syllable of ever and nation and the t in sit .

		The alphabet gives
Tiurt	PERSON	and hurst as exemplifying the long sound of the u heard in hut and tub ; this the key con - cedes to the sound heard in curl and fur ^ but marks the vowel in fir , fern , and earth as the long sound of the obscure vowel in the last syllable of ever and nation .

		The alphabet notes the o in note as the long sound of the in obey ; the key differentiates the o in hero from the sound heard in so and soul by affixing to the former a vanish sound resembling that of the u mfull .

		The alphabet gives the diphthong oi as composed of the o sound heard in on and not and the i sound in it and in ; the key compounds it of the o sound heard in the last syllable of achor or the first syllable of morality and of the i in sit .

		There are other differences , due , how - ever , for the most part to the fact that the key dis - criminates more largely than the alphabet : I have lim - ited comparisons here to the cases in which the alphabet provides characters for markings identical with those of the key and arrives at a disagreement ; though I find I have omitted the long sound of the e in met and fen in the alphabet as exemplified by the vowel in they and dey ; while the key marks the sound in they as made up of the vowel heard in the last syllable of the noun survey and the i in it .

		In all cases in which a final r follows a long vowel sound , the key adds the obscure sound heard in the last syllable of ever to the initial character of the vowel , which the alphabet does not do .

		It is evident that there are differences of a vital character between the two schemes of pronunciation .

		In some cases , notably in that of the long i sound , these are due to real differences between the language as spoken in
England	LOCATION	and in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This may also be true of the sound in care and pare .

		Those of us who were taught to discriminate between the sound heard in there and air and that in their and heir will learn with some curiosity that neither in
England	LOCATION	nor the
United States	LOCATION	is there dictionary authority for such discrimination , the British giving them all the sound heard in the latter pair and the Americans that heard in the former .

		But the
American Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	and the phoneticians of the '' Oxford '' dictionary do not agree , it has been shown , about the sound of long o , of long i , and of the diphthong oi , and are in disagreement regarding all long vowel sounds followed by final r , -- and there are numerous slighter divergences .

		If an appeal be now taken to Messrs. Sweet and Bell -- with whom Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	may be named -- this con - fusion will be found to be worse confounded .

		With them the name sound of e is made up of the i in it and a con - sonantal y , and the long oo sound heard in food of the short 00 sound in foot and a consonantal w. With them the final r sound disappears except when carried as an initial r to a succeeding word beginning with a vowel , though in every case modifying a preceding long vowel by what is called a '' vocal murmur . ''

		Though it is not expressly noted , the present tendency is to make im - proper diphthongs of almost all the long vowel sounds in English with the exception of the two sounds of a heard in ah and awe , by the addition of either conso - nantal w or y. Thus the name sounds of a , e , and t , and of the diphthong oi end with y ; and the name sounds of and u , of the long oo , and of the diphthong ou as in foul , with to .

		The '' Century '' dictionary does not mark a y sound in mayor , seer , buyer , or boyar , nor a w sound in sower , wooer , bower , or ewer , though author - izing the pronunciation of every one of these words as a dissyllable .

		Yet it is present , and , it may be added , the discriminating ear can also detect a y sound in fear and fire , and a w sound in sore , poor , your , and flour .

		The differences are slight -- and seem to be growing slighter -- between the pronunciation of such words as cere and seer , byre and buyer , sore and sower , flour and flower , and your and ewer ; in poetry all are used as monosyllables or dissyllables indifferently , unless , as in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's case , the speech has a flavor of
North British	LOCATION	, where the final r sound is insisted upon .

		All these failures of accordance between those who have become specialists in phonetics , like the phone - ticians , or dabblers in phonetics , like the philologists , point out more clearly than mere words the important fact that English is a living language and that its sounds , particularly its vowel sounds , are always in a state of transition .

		Those not definitively committed to some form of `` spelling reform '' will probably agree that the very fact that our spelling bears no real relation to our spoken language has left our mother tongue the freer to develop itself along the lines of least resistance , and that any attempt to crystallize our speech in the written language would have a disastrous effect upon the evo - lution now going steadily on , -- vide the concluding chapter of Mr.
Sweet	PERSON	's '' History of English Sounds '' for a discussion of existing tendencies toward further and more radical changes .

		But these same changes have another significance in pointing out differences which already exist -- as in the case of the name sound of i already referred to -- be -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23T tween British speech and American speech .

		Any at - tempt at spelling reform which does not recognize such differences is essentially faulty , for it seems to be con - ceded by all that there is no logical nor scientific abiding place between spelling as we do now , and spelling as we pronounce .

		If we retain our ancient and unscientific orthography , there is certainly no danger of the great branches of the English-speaking race becoming mutu - ally unintelligible ; whatever our divergences , even if they should reach forward to a time when a cultivated Englishman and a cultivated American could not un - derstand one another 's conversation , we should still be able to communicate in writing , after the manner of the Chinese and Japanese .

		This fear of unintelligibility becomes more and more remote , of course , with every step in science and diplomacy which links the two na - tions together .

		There are no statistics that I have been able to dis - cover which show the proportion of written words in English to words spoken .

		Even in a country like the
United States	LOCATION	, where so many men and women spend much of their time in reading newspapers as well as magazines and books , it must still be evident that spoken words vastly outnumber written words or words read .

		Ten minutes ' conversation reported verbatim occupies more than a newspaper column when reduced to print ; fifty newspaper columns contain as much reading matter as the average novel .

		By as much as the spoken words exceed in number the words written and read , by so much is the spoken language more important than the written , as a matter of axiom .

		The future expansion of English , indeed , may be said to depend almost wholly upon speech as against writing or reading .

		Anything which seeks to prevent the normal growth of the spoken language , therefore , whether by crystallizing speech into phonetic signs like those recommended by spelling '' reformers '' or in some other manner , must operate against the best interests of the race , and in operating against them against the best interests of our literature .

William Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	.

		* In reading of the life of
William Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	, '' Artist , Naturalist , Author , '' one is irresistibly reminded of the well-loved lines from `` Thanatopsis '' : '' To him who in the love of nature holds Communion with her visible forniB , she speaks A various language . ''

		To few indeed has it been granted to interpret that language so variously .

		That deep , strong , persistent note that
Thoreau	PERSON	sounded was fol - lowed later in the century by
Gibson	PERSON	, not be - cause
Thoreau	PERSON	was his master , but because for him too the call was imperative ; and what he saw he told by voice and pen , pencil and brush , until his originality , his versatility , his buoyant life , brought him friends and followers every - where .

		The book on
Gibson	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
John Coleman Adams	PERSON	is not a dry record of facts , but rather a eulogy , -- a eulogy in a good cause , however , for one fancies that the book has been written not more to picture this most interesting life than to arouse fresh enthusiasm for those studies of which the author is himself an ex - ponent .


Gibson	PERSON	may have had faults , but Mr.
Adams	PERSON	does not mention them .

		Bather , he draws a loving and intensely enthusiastic pic - ture of the artist , naturalist , and writer , later filling in the outlines by means of letters , the reminiscences of friends , and various incidents .

		We can read also the series of portraits , from childhood to manhood , which show from first to last a countenance singularly open , with clear , bright eyes , slightly full , curved lips , the entire face lit with intelligence and animation , and wholly lovable .

		The first three chapters , comprising less than a third of the book , are given to an outline of
Gibson	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		We learn that he was born at
Sandy Hook	PERSON	,
Newtown	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
October 6 , 1850	DATE	.

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has called his first chapter '' A Fortunate Boyhood . ''

Gibson	PERSON	had a mother who , besides being intelligent and well-educated , was loving and sympathetic , and helped him in his childish nature studies , -- even to the extent of giving him a drawer in her linen-press for his worms I We do not learn much of

		238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, town , made his later home in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, where
Gibson	PERSON	had Henry
Ward Beecher	PERSON	for pastor and friend .

		But we can infer that the father was a man of business , more occupied with his office than with his children , since there is a scathing letter from
Gibson	PERSON	's schoolmaster suggesting that the father require one of the clerks to write to his homesick boy once or twice a quarter .

		It was this schoolmaster , Mr.
Gunn	PERSON	, who presided over the other portion of
Gibson	PERSON	's '' fortunate boyhood . ''

		At the '' Gunnery , '' in
Washington	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, the boy spent several happy years , which always loomed large in his memory , and to these he attributed much of his success in later life .

		The account of these school-days is most inter - esting , including several delightful letters to the boy 's mother .

		We learn that while ''
Willie	PERSON	'' was '' a dear little fellow , '' bright and obedient , it somewhat troubled Mr.
Gunn	PERSON	that he had not '' learned to be spontaneously industrious . ''

		Later , however , when attending the
Polytech	ORGANIZATION	- nic , this trait of indolence disappeared ; and thereafter , even to the end , he worked with consuming energy .

		In
1868	DATE
Gibson	ORGANIZATION	's father died , apparently leaving no fortune ; and
Gibson	PERSON	took up life - insurance as a means of support .

		This lasted but a short time , however , for , seeing a draughts - man drawing upon the block ,
Gibson	PERSON	decided that he could do it also ; and thereupon began the struggle that was to result in his unique position as artist-naturalist .

		He had tried to draw , from his earliest childhood , but had been discouraged in it , as so many others have been .

		He had no training , no art-education of any kind .

		But his labor and perseverance , added to his inborn genius , overcame all difficulties , and before long he made a modest beginning by illustrating '' The Chimney Corner '' and '' The Boys ' and Girls ' Weekly , '' and a little later he made botanical drawings for '' The American Agriculturalist '' and '' Appletons ' Encyclopedia . ''

		In
1872	DATE	came his first large commission , a set of twelve drawings on stone for the Appletons ' huge botanical charts .

		This work was done with remarkable rapidity , and brought him nearly a thousand dollars ; and from now on his path was clear .

		About this time
Gibson	PERSON	made his first orig - inal composition , and soon thereafter received a commission from the Appletons to make a sketching tour into
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, to obtain illustrations for '' Picturesque America . ''

		He afterwards made other sketching trips : to
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-LRB- 1876 -RRB- , to the White Mountains -LRB- 1880 and
1883	DATE	-RRB- , to the South -LRB-
1886	DATE	-RRB- , and to
Europe	LOCATION	-LRB- 1888 -RRB- .

		The year
1878	DATE	, we are told , marks an epoch not only in
Gibson	PERSON	's life , but in American illustration .

		It was in that year that he fur - nished designs for an article by Mrs.
Helen S. Conant	PERSON	on '' Birds and Plumage , '' in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		These illustrations in - cluded a full-page picture of a peacock 's feather , which was so striking that it attracted much attention from both laymen and artists .

		Although
Gibson	PERSON	wrote in
1876	DATE	'' The Com - plete American Trapper , '' a book for boys , his real literary work began in
1879	DATE	with the first of the articles that were afterwards collected Pastoral Days . ''

		This article was an ac - as count , in writing and sketches , of a summer vacation at his old homes in
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		He was now fairly launched in the career that he followed for the rest of his too - short life , and , considering all the other work he kept going at the same time , his books followed one an - other in quick succession . ''

		Highways and Byways , '' extended from a series of magazine articles , appeared in
1882	DATE	, and '' Happy Hunt - ing Grounds '' in
1886	DATE	.

		These were both re - ceived with favor and even enthusiasm .

		Mean - while , the author had been providing the illustrations for
E. P. Roe	PERSON	's '' Success with Small Fruits '' and '' Nature 's Serial Story '' ; '' In Berkshire with the Wild Flowers , '' by the
Goodale	PERSON	sisters ;
Drake	PERSON	's '' Heart of the White Mountains '' ; '' The Master of the Gunnery , '' a memorial of his old teacher ; '' Sketches in the South , '' by
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	and
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	; and for many mis - cellaneous articles .

		During these years , also ,
Gibson	PERSON	had been enlarging his field by working in water-colors , which remained to the last a favorite medium with him , and had made some attempts in oils .

		He had long since made a name for himself , and for everything that he did , writing , sketch - ing , or painting , there was a ready welcome .

		He had opened many unseeing eyes , led thou - sands into new paths , and in short performed the part of a new kind of missionary both in this country and abroad .

		His remaining ten years saw the publication of five more books , -- '' Strolls by Starlight and Sunshine , '' '' Sharp Eyes '' -LRB- his most popular work -RRB- , '' Our Edible Mushrooms and Toadstools , '' '' Eye Spy , '' and '' My Studio Neighbors '' ; and he left a quantity of material , in notes and sketches , for an illus - trated botany and other works .

		During his

1896	DATE	, after several months ' failing health , he died at his old home in
Washington	LOCATION	, Con - necticut .

		Such , in brief , are the outlines of
Gibson	PERSON	's life , -- an uneventful life in one sense , but in another crowded to overflowing ; a life best shown in its results .

		His marvellous capacity for work was one of
Gibson	ORGANIZATION	's most character - istic traits , and in it lies the secret not only of his success , but of his early death .

		In Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's words , '' The fierce fires of a relentless industry had burned his forces to a cinder . ''

		It is chiefly as artist and author that
Gibson	PERSON	appears in the foregoing sketch , but these two involved his other side .

		For in everything that he did , writing or picturing , he was inter - preting nature .

		Nature-lover he was always , from his earliest childhood ; and by faithful , loving observation and investigation he became a naturalist as well .

		Nature in all her mani - festations was a constant passion with him ; but it was through making known to multi - tudes the secrets of growing things that he will be longest remembered .

		The second part of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's book deals with
Gibson	PERSON	's work and his methods of working in his different mediums , and with '' the per - sonal side . ''

		The final chapter , together with an account of his death and funeral services , con - tains the reminiscences of friends and eulogistic tributes .

		Emerson 's words , '' Do that which is assigned to you , and you can not hope or dare too much , '' might have been
Gibson	PERSON	's motto .

		Brave , self-confident , but not overbearing , full of life and joy and wholesome fun , he carried out the promise of his bright and lovable boyhood , and lives in the memory of all who knew him , not only as genius , but as man .


Gibson	PERSON	might have found a biographer who gave more attention to detail , if a formal biog - raphy were wanted , but he could not have found a more enthusiastic one .

		There are many things an inquirer could ask and not find answered in this book , but we learn all that is needful to enable us to account for the man and his work .

		The arrangement of the book gives rise to some repetition , and in one case the different accounts do not exactly agree : * .

		e. , the accounts of the inception of `` Sharp Eyes '' as given on pages 72 and 173 .

		There are occasional slips of statement or arrange - ment , as on page 210 , where Mr.
Adams	PERSON	says , '' Near the close of the same year , '' etc. .

		Re - ferring to the previous letters we find them dated successively
1863	DATE	,
1864	DATE	,
1864	DATE	,
1865	DATE	, while the two letters following the above state - ment are dated
1863	DATE	.

		There is no great pre - tension to literary style , but we get that vivid impression that is given when an author 's heart is in his work .

		The book is attractively pre - sented , and contains , besides the portraits al - ready mentioned , and views of
Gibson	PERSON	's homes and haunts and his grave , a considerable num - ber of reproductions of his works .

		liEADERS OF VICTORIAN IiITEKATURE .

		* It requires courage and confidence in a critic to sit down to-day and write about such old - fashioned matters as
Thackeray	PERSON	's novels and
George Eliot	PERSON	's , instead of dropping sparkling utterances on such up-to-date and modern topics as , for instance , '' Recent Phases of Romantic Fiction '' or '' Exotic Tendencies in Present - day Dilettantism . ''

		A bright screed prophe - sying a Bulwer Revival or an eighteenth cen - tury Renaissance might do , if one insisted on dealing with old-time topics ; but an effort to arrive at a sound estimate of
Carlyle	LOCATION	or Mat - thew Arnold seems hardly in keeping with the present tendencies of current criticism , at least so far as it is observable in our critical jour - nalism .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	doubtless has the quali - ties mentioned above to some extent , for he presents us with six essays on what might be called classic subjects ; he gives us estimates of
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Meredith	PERSON	, which have little connection with an interest in
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, and the Ro - mance of
American History	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is much in Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's favor .

		His work is not designed for the moment only ; he considers fundamental questions -LRB- we might almost say -RRB- in estimating literature ; he sets himself at some of the great problems of liter - ature .

		He could hardly attempt anything more solid if he published an estimate of Macaulay in the '' Quarterly Review , '' and perhaps would not do so much even then .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	, then , has set himself to a piece of work that was well worth while , an attempt to form an estimate of the most con - siderable prose writers of our literature , in the period just before our own .

		240 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, occupation for a critic of the first order .

		Such a critic will consider the greatest names of all time , he will have his opinions also upon the work of his own day ; but he is most usefully employed when he deals with the generation which has just preceded .

		him , when he tries to put general opinion , released from the prejudices of the present , on the way to a judgment that shall last .

		There is often a period of relaxa - tion in our interest in the great figures of liter - ature who have just passed away .

		They achieve fame in life , let us say , they are an influence , perhaps , for the decade after their death .

		But then , before they take a definite place as clas - sics , there comes a period in which people are not much interested in them .

		Sometimes this period comes even before their death , as was the case with
Wordsworth	PERSON	, who in his later years was by no means the figure in the minds of those who loved poetry that he became after - ward .

		Sometimes it comes very soon after death , as was the case with
Dickens	PERSON	, who , people think , is now ripe for a '' revival . ''

		But it generally comes some time .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	practically notes this fact in regard to some of those of whom he writes . ''

		Carlyle 's own writings , '' he says , '' fell speed - ily into a neglect , '' etc. ; '' How long is it since
George Eliot	PERSON	's name has been the subject of even a literary allusion ? ''

		; '' No writer , prob - ably , ever passed so quickly -LSB- as Matthew Ar - nold -RSB- from unpopularity through fame to comparative neglect . ''

		Three of
Kuskin	PERSON	's books '' probably comprise all of his product that will last through the epoch of indifference to much that the present age has delighted in , which we can readily perceive to be upon us . ''

		Thack - eray , it is to be remarked , achieved a fame which has steadily increased ,
George Meredith	PERSON	was received with a neglect which is but slowly diminishing .

		What will a critic say of such writers , or rather of writers at such a centre of indiffer - ence ?

		He has a responsible position , for if he be really a critic of influence he will have no small part in pronouncing the everlasting yea or the everlasting no -LRB- to parody an author in mind -RRB- which once really pronounced by posterity , is rarely reversed .

		It is for the critic to con - sider what true worth remains after the changes of a score or two score years ; and in accord - ance with his opinion to place upon a pedestal in the hall of fame or to put on a high shelf in the garret .

		Kuskin must go up garret , there is no doubt of that ; and
Thackeray	PERSON	is to have a place in the hall of fame , or better in our own front hall or the parlor .

		A small bust of
Matthew Arnold	ORGANIZATION	will look well in the study ; that life - size statue of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	might be put in one of the niches in the second story staircase ; that strange-looking picture of
George Eliot	PERSON	will do for the spare room ; and
Meredith	PERSON	may as well be left where he is , for he may have to be brought out .

		Such approximately is Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's disposition of these household favorites .

		What reasons does he consider in this mat - ter ?

		Well , he is not one of those critics who merely give you their personal impressions on reading '' Vanity Fair '' say , or ''
Sartor Kesar	PERSON	- tus . ''

		Nor is he a historical critic -LRB- or evolution - ary -RRB- who shows you that they were all exactly what they had to be and could by no means avoid having been .

		Nor even is he one of the strictly objective kind who have such definite knowledge of what the works of genius should be that they can tell you how near any par - ticular specimens come to perfection .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	is historical in so far as he considers the man always with his books and generally rather than his books .

		He is objective , how - ever , in so far as he puts before us a net result of each career .

		But given the net result , the question is , what is there in it , whereby
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and others should con - tinue to have a claim , or rather hold , on the attention of the world ?

		Here , of course , a critic can hardly avoid being somewhat personal .

		Certain qualities or virtues are of immense value to him , and he thinks an author worth while according as he has or has not something of these virtues .

		His preference may be founded upon the most solid groundwork of reason , but it is very apt to have something of a more personal basis .

		The qualities of most importance to Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	are Temperament and Thought .

		Thus he still retains a fondness for
George Eliot	PERSON	, because she can think , although temperament rather than thought is really the thing in a novelist ; and
Carlyle	LOCATION	is noteworthy for him in spite of the fact that his boisterous thinking did not end in much of consequence , because he did have the chief thing about genius , namely , personality , because no writer ever had so much temperament .

		So he can not bear
Ruskin	PERSON	because his didactic temperament was tedious , yet such as it was , entirely predomi - nated over his thought .

		And with
Meredith	PERSON	, in spite of his intellectuality , Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	can not get over the fact that his temperament is really
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 absence of temperament .

		As to
Thackeray	PERSON	, who holds first place in Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's mind , his is one of the most marked personalities in letters , '' his personal force and charm take him quite outside '' the operation of the rule recommending a detached attitude .

		And Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	was essentially a critic , and a critic of a special kind , namely , one who applied ideas , a brain centre rather than a nerve centre .

		It would be wrong to imply that Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	considers his authors purely from the stand - point of thought and temperament .

		He does not ; he has other matters in mind -- art , in - fluence , history , -- but no other matters are so important to him , and no others are so fre - quently applied in the way of a test .

		And I suppose for this reason his judgments will not appeal to all , for there may be some who do not care most for temperament or thought .

		In my novel reading , though I am very fond of
Thackeray	LOCATION	, I find that I remember
Clara Mowbray	PERSON	's meeting with
Francis Tyrrel	PERSON	, and
Henry Durie	PERSON	at table with his wife and his elder brother , with a kind of thrill that I do not get in '' Pendennis '' or '' The Newcomes . ''

		I am told there is something of the sort in a certain famous scene in '' Vanity Fair '' ; it may be so , but not for me .

		For myself I value ro - mance -- rather a poor name for the thing -- more than personality or temperament .

		When we come to thought , in our critics , there I am more happily with Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	, although even here I observe -LRB- with approach to shame -RRB- that my favorite critics are more apt to be men of a sense of beauty than of a sense of truth .

		But my own preferences aside , there is surely ground for thinking that a very important thing for a novelist is the power to create the romantic , the tragic , the emotional in life , and a very important thing for a critic to have a sure perception of what is beautiful in nature and in art .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	does not entirely neglect these matters , but they are evidently second in his mind to the more important con - siderations of temperament and thought .

		I am tempted to add a word on Mr.
Brown	PERSON	- ell 's style , not as a comment , or a caution either , but as a comfort to one who might other - wise begin upon the book without warning .

		In spite of one or two minor but real draw - backs , * the superficially repellent character of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's mode of expression is , in the author 's mind at least , one of the necessities * I believe the placing of clauses gives rise now and then to ambiguity and that the loose structure is in the long run fatiguing .

		of exactness .

		It can not be denied that he uses queer words : one would advise the average reader to keep within reaching distance of a dictionary .

		But the slight crabbedness arising from this cause is probably compensated for by the fact that the queer words usually do give some precise shade of meaning : poten - tialities , impressionistically , notablest , idiosyn - cratic , illogicality , dilutest , tropicality , insen - sitiveness , -- they do look rather out of the way in a list ; but each in its own place they are seen to have a very specific meaning and one which could not otherwise be so shortly conveyed .

		So no one should be displeased by Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's style : with a little experience one gets to like it .

		For it is a style of which even the drawbacks arise from their having some thought to them .

		And this we may say of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's work as a whole , that it has its roots in hard thinking .

		As the reader of his earlier books knows , you may disagree with particular views , you may think he has not the right standpoint for the best critical results , but you can not criticise him at all without thinking the matter over pretty thoroughly yourself .

		Thus the work is stimulating , sometimes negatively , it is true , as well as often positively .

		And that is some - thing well worth while .

		I rather suppose his judgments are pretty sound , too , -- that his authors will be found in the future much where he says they are .

		But that is a minor matter on the whole ; it would be a misfortune , in fact , if he fixed them all definitely for ever , for then just so much of the critic 's occupation would be gone .

		242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, lumbus really received a letter and chart or map from
Toscanelli	LOCATION	, that influenced the voy - ages of
Columbus	LOCATION	, and his opinion has received the support of
Fiske	PERSON	and
Markham	PERSON	.

		Only of late years has the careful investigation of scholars led to the view now so clearly demon - strated by
Vignaud	PERSON	and supported by those who agree with him in denying the authenticity of the alleged letter of
Toscanelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		Vignaud , even in differing from them , pays due tribute to the erudition of those who maintain the other view , and especially of Harisse , its strongest advo - cate .

		In this exhaustive volume on the subject , just publishedjVignaud shows that there is no origi - nal of the letter or of any of the pretended cor - respondence of Toscanelli and
Columbus	LOCATION	, and that all knowledge of it depends on copies of a much later date .

		He points out that in no one of the numerous works , letters , and lives of the contemporaries , associates , and friends of
Toscanelli	LOCATION	, is there any mention of his theory of a western world .


Fernand Columbus	PERSON	first spoke of it in a book printed in
Florence	LOCATION	in
1571	DATE	, and it is again referred to in a popular translation of the geography of the English - man
Holywood	LOCATION	, Italianized under the name of
Sacrobosco	LOCATION	, printed in
1672	DATE	.

		Oddly enough the editor or translator errs as to the date of the return of
Columbus	LOCATION	, and puts it a year before his start ; and he makes him write then to
Toscanelli	LOCATION	, who died in
1482	DATE	.

		However , in later editions of
1573	DATE	and
1579	DATE	the whole matter was omitted .

		Columbus himself wrote and spoke freely and frequently , yet he never referred to Toscanelli nor mentioned any cor - respondence with him nor acquaintance with or knowledge of him or of his letters or writings .

		Vignaud shows that the Toscanelli letter had neither scientific nor practical value , and could have been of no use either to
Columbus	LOCATION	or to the King of
Portugal	LOCATION	, who , like his father and brothers , was a good geographer .

		It is based on the ancient geography of
Ptolemy	LOCATION	, yet the first book on that subject was not printed until
1472	DATE	, a year after the date of the pre - tended letter .

		Columbus did not need help from that source , for he based his geographical knowledge on Aristotle , and not on
Ptolemy	LOCATION	, and even that was at second hand , for he was no scholar .

		He left a well-thumbed copy , full of his notes , of the ''
Imago Mundi	ORGANIZATION	'' of Cardinal d'Ailly , published about
1480	DATE	, who copied from
Roger Bacon	PERSON	's Opus majusof
1267	DATE	.

		Columbus also left an annotated copy of
Marco Polo	PERSON	, one of his guides .

		Columbus had no real scientific basis for his voyages and explorations , and found one only in later years .

		To credit him with a theory at the outset , instead of after his discovery , the pretended letter of
Tosca	LOCATION	- nelli was invented and palmed off by
Las Casas	LOCATION	and
Fernand Columbus	PERSON	, so as to establish
Columbus	LOCATION	's reputation for scientific knowledge , and give him the credit of being the corre - spondent of
Toscanelli	ORGANIZATION	, a famous authority on geography of his day .

		Columbus was charged with getting his information from an old pilot , -- a story that was denounced by
Washington Irving	LOCATION	, the first and the fullest of the modern biographers of
Columbus	LOCATION	; and by
Harisse	PERSON	, the first of '' Columbists '' of our own day ; and by so many others that it is now wholly discredited .

		Yet
Vignaud	PERSON	inclines to give it some weight , based on the fact that it was a rumor current during the time in which
Columbus	LOCATION	lived among his contemporaries .

		Having shown that
Columbus	LOCATION	himself never knew of any letter from
Toscanelli	LOCATION	,
Vignaud	PERSON	proves by an exhaustive demonstration that
Bartholomew Columbus	PERSON	, the brother of the great navigator , was the author of the forged letter , and that it was used by
Las Casas	LOCATION	, per - haps with knowledge of its source , for as he had access to and made free use of the
Colum	PERSON	- bus family papers , he could not fail to know that
Columbus	LOCATION	himself never had any such letter from
Toscanelli	LOCATION	, and that it was produced only to give it a place in
Las Casas	LOCATION	's book , as an answer to charges against
Columbus	LOCATION	, which lessened the value of the claims of his family on the Spanish government .

		The old nobles objected to and opposed the dignities attained by the family of
Columbus	LOCATION	as a reward for his voyages and discoveries .

		Even more exhaust - ive is
Vignaud	PERSON	's demonstration of the falsity of
Las Casas	LOCATION	's statement that he had before him as he wrote the chart or map sent by
Toscanelli	ORGANIZATION	to
Columbus	LOCATION	with the pretended letter .

		Vignaud shows a thorough knowledge of the vexed questions of geography so often dis - cussed by
Markham	PERSON	and
Winsor	PERSON	, and many others .

		His book is a scholarly and exhaustive piece of historical work , well supported by an appendix containing a reproduction of the alleged letter and other original contemporary documents , and by a full , fair , and complete analysis of the arguments and evidence for and against his own view .

		It takes its due place in the series of early voyages to which
Harisse	PERSON	has contributed his volumes on the Cabots and on
Corte	ORGANIZATION	and
Gaspard Real	ORGANIZATION	and on
Columbus	LOCATION	,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 and
Schaefer	PERSON	and
Cordier	PERSON	and
Hauser	PERSON	and Dorez their 's on early voyages and geographical discoveries .

		Vignaud shows a large knowledge of all the literature of his subject , and a power of critical discrimination in using it so as to get at the truth and of setting it forth clearly .

		He is quite free from that intemperate tone that marks others , notably Harisse , whose great attainments are marred by his persistent assertions that anyone with an opinion that does not agree with his own must necessarily be wrong and must be told so very harshly .


J. G. ROSENGARTEN	PERSON	.

		The
First English Novelist	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
Samuel Richardson	PERSON	's novels are generally believed to belong to the class of books that are talked about but never read .

		The exces - sive length , the epistolary form , the unsym - pathetic social background , and the mild '' tea-drinking '' tone of his three works are supposed to render them distasteful to readers who devour their so-called romances by the tens of thousands .

		It is also objected that
Richardson	PERSON	's chief theme is seduction , -- a theme uncongenial to the manners and ideals of our time .

		Nevertheless
Richardson	PERSON	has im - posed himself upon English literature as a `` classic '' ; and there is reason to believe that his fame is likely to grow rather than wane , when the reading public comes back , after its periodic debauch of melodrama to a normal interest in the representation of human character .

		There has never been any question of Rich - ardson 's position historically .

		He wrote the first novels of English life , as we understand the word novel -- a fictitious picture of life that has some approach to probability .

		If we except the gentle shadow of Sir
Roger	PERSON	, and the vigorous figure of
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, the first characters in English fiction -- imaginatively conceived , organically developed -- are
Pamela	PERSON	,
Clarissa	PERSON	, and
Lovelace	PERSON	.

		In spite of Fielding 's keen satire , we must admit that
Richardson	PERSON	presented the petty world of the middle of the eighteenth century more justly , more minutely , with a truer feeling for its manners and ideals , than did the great master himself .

		And in construction , in the sense of form , ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' is superior to ''
Tom Jones	PERSON	. ''

		More - over ,
Richardson	PERSON	has the honor largely of dis - •

Ethel M. M. McKenna	PERSON	.

		In twenty volumes , illna - trated .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		covering a new reading public , and one that has continued to support enormously the novel , -- the middle class .

		Perhaps most important of all ,
Richardson	PERSON	first developed a field of lit - erary material -LRB- ^ possibly following
Marivaux	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that has yielded rich harvests to a long line of English novelists , -- the field of feminine sen - sibilities and sentiments .

		Lastly ,
Richardson	PERSON	has influenced continental literature directly and indirectly more than any writer of his time .

		But
Richardson	PERSON	has a far greater claim to his seat among the immortals than that of his - torical significance : he created one work that is of permanent importance , for which no al - lowances have to be made .

		Mere length of itself never killed any book , and the nine vol - umes of ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' still command the reader , -- nay , absorb him , if once he sub - mits himself wholly to their skilful pages .

		The very length of the piece is a part of its art , for this breadth of treatment permits the gradual development of character , the fine gradation of values , the winding process of thorough analysis , which fix forever a picture of life .

		Grreat novelists have always appreciated the necessity of length .

		The story of two or three hundred octavo pages is an invention of the modern book-maker to meet a commercial opportunity .

		Moreover , in unity of plan , in comprehensiveness of design , and in dramatic relationship of values , ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' is one of the very few English novels that can pretend to perfection of form .

		Structurally it is , as
Richardson	PERSON	says somewhere , '' a dra - matic narrative . ''


Lovelace	PERSON	, the mind of the piece , and
Clarissa	PERSON	, the soul of the piece , are two of the small group of fictitious characters that have a permanent type existence .

		Love - lace is a superb creation .

		For wit , power , pure intellectual brilliancy and mastery , he is the ablest villain outside the drama in English literature .

		The mystery of his creation , if we consider
Richardson	PERSON	's temperament and ex - perience in life , is far greater than that of
Clarissa	LOCATION	, or , if we consider Fielding , than that of
Tom Jones	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's jeer at Rich - ardson as '' the old maid of genius '' falls flat when we realize the full virility of
Lovelace	PERSON	.

		The style through which
Lovelace	ORGANIZATION	reveals the involutions and subtleties of his nature is unique in its absolute adaptation and consist - ency .

		Beside the restless play of his brilliant mind , the `` divine Clarissa '' even is a more ordinary conceptiop .

		Yet the delicacy and thoroughness of her portraiture have saved her from the cold formality of her conception .

		In 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, spite of
Richardson	PERSON	, we feel that she loves
Lovelace	PERSON	, `` cruel as a panther '' as he is , and that in her steady refusal to consider the pos - sibility of reparation , and in her death , she is the equal of
Lovelace	LOCATION	.

		In refusing to allot a happy ending to
Clarissa	LOCATION	,
Richardson	PERSON	tran - scended the limitations of his class and of his age .

		Thus the theme of the novel , to which objection has been made , has been raised by the force of
Richardson	PERSON	's art above the vulgar matter of seduction .

		It is rather the struggle between exact purity of soul and the predatory habit of the male .

		He who sees in ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' a mere fencing match over the mar - riage contract misses the tale altogether .


Richardson	PERSON	's morality is not our morality . ''

		Pamela '' will remain as a comic example of didactic ineptitude , and '' Sir
Charles Grandi	PERSON	- son '' as a pompous and tiresome lesson in manners .

		But in spite of his fatal desire to teach lessons of conduct ,
Richardson	PERSON	triumphed in ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' over the weight of his moral intention , just as he triumphed over the limitation of his literary form , and over the conventions and sterility of his age .

		In spite of himself , as it were , he created some real people and surrendered himself to them with the complete insight and fidelity that is the mark of the artist .


Richardson	PERSON	's world was a petty world in many respects .

		We flatter ourselves that we live more largely to-day .

		But ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	'' is another proof that , for the making of permanent art , the accident of material is comparatively unimportant .

		The present edition , in twenty handy and well-printed volumes , is a reprint of the text of
Mangin	PERSON	's
1811	DATE	edition , with reproductions of the original engravings .

		Miss
McKenna	PERSON	's brief introduction presents adequately the chief biographical and critical facts .

Burton	PERSON	's `` Wanderings in Three Continents . ''

		* Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	was perhaps the most redoubtable explorer of modern times ; and to those who love adventure , his will always be a fascinating name .

		The posthumous volume by him , entitled '' Wanderings in Three Con - tinents , '' is spoken of by the editor , Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	* Wanderings in Three Continents .

		By the late Captain Sir
Richard F. Burton	PERSON	.

		Edited , with a Preface , by
W. H. Wilkins	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:

Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Wilkins	PERSON	, as a collection of '' essays , '' but would more rightly be called sketches or memoranda of
Burton	ORGANIZATION	's principal travels in
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		This book includes brief ac - counts of his wonderful Medinah-Mecca pil - grimage , of his Harat and
Tanganika	LOCATION	explora - tions , of his Dahome and
Congo	LOCATION	trips , of his travels in
Brazil	LOCATION	and the
Western United States	LOCATION	, and of his
Palmyra	LOCATION	journey .

		Burton always had an eye to scenery , and some of his descriptions are very vivid -- notably this pic - ture of the Arabian desert : '' The sky is terrible in its pitiless splendours and blinding beauty , while the simoon , or wind of the wild , caresses the cheek with the flaming breath of a lion .

		The filmy spray of sand and the upseething of the at - mosphere , the heat-reek and the dancing of the air upon the baked surface of the bright yellow soil , blending with the dazzling hue above , invests the horizon with a broad band of deep dark green , and blurs the gaunt figures of the camels , which , at a distance , appear strings of gigantic birds . ''

		Or take this picture of an extensive region in
East Africa	LOCATION	: `` The black greasy ground , veiled with thick shrub - bery , supports in the more open spaces screens of tiger and spear-grass twelve and thirteen feet high , with every blade a finger 's breadth ; and the towering treea are often clothed with huge creepers , forming heavy columns of densest verdure .

		The earth , ever rain - drenched , emits the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen , and in some parts the traveller might fancy a corpse to be hidden behind every bush .

		That no feature of miasma might be wanting to complete the picture , filthy heaps of the meanest hovels sheltered their miserable inhabitants , whose frames are lean with constant in - toxication , and whose limbs are distorted with ulcerous sores . ''

		But on the whole the most interesting sketch in this book is that of his journey to Salt
Lake City	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	.

		This is very readable and graphic , and , as the editor says , '' much better than his bulky book on the same subject . ''

		He records three '' novel sensations '' that his American trip gave him : < `` The first was , to feel that all men were your equal .

		... The second was to see one 's quondam acquaint - ance , the Kaffir or Negro , put by his grass kilt and coat of grease , insert himself in broadcloth , part his wool on one side , shave , and call himself , not Sambo , but `` Mr.
Scott	PERSON	. '

		The third was to meet in the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	with a refreshing specimen of that far-off Old World . ''

		Burton showed through all .

		his life a savage independence , which reflects itself in a strong , terse , blunt literary style .

		His multifarious works are , for the general reader , too diffuse , and on the other hand this epitome is too con - densed ; yet it is the best outline of his travels now available .

DIAL 245 Recent Fiction	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The work which must occupy the first place in the present review is '' The Valley of Decision , '' by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's earlier books have had the touch of distinction , and pre - pared us for something unusual when the time should come for her to put forth her whole power in a novel of large plan and comprehensive content .

		The qualities displayed by her short stories were such as to suggest the work of a master-hand , making us think at one moment , which impressed by their analytical subtlety , of the work of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and at another , which impressed by their artistic finality , of the work of no less a man than Tour - gudnieff .

		Suggestions of this sort being now in order , it may be said that the masterpiece of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	has been constantly in our mind while reading '' The Valley of Decision . ''

		This comparison , how - ever , is subject to qualifications , and may serve as a starting-point for what we wish to say concerning Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's work .

		By way of similarity , the two books have in common the same scenes , the same society , and -LRB- within a generation -RRB- the same period .

		The Duchy of Pianura is not found upon any map , but it can not be far removed from the region to which ' < La Chartreuse de Parme '' leads as a willing sojourner .

		Nor does the fact that we are dealing with the period leading up to , and con - temporary with , the French Revolution , instead of the post - Napoleonic period , make any very essential difference .

		The liberal ferment is already at work ; it has simply not reached a stage so far advanced .

		one hand , and , on the other , in the patient endeavors of the economist and the jurist .

		It has not yet been translated into political terms , although such a translation is clearly impending , and although the principal character is a man in the vanguard of the thought of the age .

		So much having been said for the resemblance of the two works , there remains the task of emphasizing their contrast .

		The obvious difference , we should say , is that Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's novel is over-intellectualized , and thus misses the rich vitality of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece .

		In Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's view , the idea , having more lasting sig - nificance than the act , is everywhere set in the foreground .

		Stendhal , for his part , had curious lapses from his professed liberalism , and was more bent upon depicting the glow and color , the in - trigues and the passions , of the period in question , than concerned with the deeper currents of the in - tellectual movement .

		He had , moreover , the ines - timable advantage of studying his material at first hand , whereas Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	has learned about it from books , which inevitably means a less vivid realization of its possibilities .

		To a reflective mind , '' The Valley of Decision '' makes the stronger ap - peal of the two books , for it is the expression of a consistent philosophy , and , if somewhat pale upon the sensuous side and somewhat weak upon the emotional side , there is no doubt of its inspiration by a true intellectual passion .

		The restraint which goes with all distinguished art is characteristic of this book even in the most pronounced spiritual crises of the action , and to a fine sense makes these scenes the more effective .

		After all , it is a drama having the human soul for its theatre that we are invited to view , rather than a drama of spectacular interest .

		The central theme is that of a man of fine impulses , becoming , by the accidents of his own birth and of the death of those standing above him , the ruler of a state .

		He is overweighted by his responsibilities , but honestly seeks the welfare of his people .

		Finally , the ingratitude of the populace which he has sought to benefit , whose passions are successfully worked upon by the partisans of the old corrupt order , hurls him from the seat of power , and leaves him in the end an outcast .

		This situation is by no means new in imaginative literature .

		Bulwer 's ''
Rienzi	PERSON	'' dealt with it in a melodramatic sort of fashion , and in more modern literature it has received impressive illustration in the '' Majesty '' of the Dutch novelist ,
Herr Couperus	PERSON	, and in '' The King , '' a drama which is one of the most extraordinary of the works of
Herr BjOrnson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	has not been insensible of the pathetic and tragic possibilities of the situation , and has developed them with rare and subtle art .

		The novel leaves little to be desired in the delicacy of its individual characterizations , in its exhibition of the inner life of the society which it depicts , and in its deft use of the physical acces - sories of the narrative .

		The charm of its finished style is a source of constant delight to the reader , and makes acceptable the many pages of historical and philosophical analysis , which , strictly speaking , 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, must be regarded as out of place in a work of fiction .

		We would not willingly spare the longest of these passages , although they very noticeably impede the progress of the action .

		The story of the first European discovery of the
New World	LOCATION	, as preserved for us in the saga of Eric the Red and the Flateyarbdk , has been utilized by Miss
Ottilie Liljencrantz	PERSON	for the framework of her story called '' The Thrall of Leif the Lucky . ''

		She has been exceptionally ingenious in working into a consistent narrative every scrap of information to be gleaned from the saga records , and in adding enough invention of her own to sustain the interest .

		How
Leif	PERSON	accepted Christianity from
Olaf Trygvas	PERSON	- son at Nidaros , how he voyaged to
Greenland	LOCATION	and quarreled with his father on this score , how he was fired by the tale of
Bjarni	ORGANIZATION	's adventure of a few years earlier , how he set sail for those strange lands that had been sighted but not explored , and how he built his booths in
Vinland	LOCATION	, wintered there , and returned the following
spring	DATE	laden with wine and furs and timber , to be acclaimed as the greatest man of his age -- all these things , and many more , are related in this fascinating volume .

		Lifelike figures are drawn from the merest hints in the Ice - landic chronicle , and even the German Tyrker becomes a real personage , although we must regard as somewhat unhappy the attempt to dififerentiate his race by filling his speech with Germanic inver - sions .

		If this is intended for comic relief , it had better have been omitted .

		The book has the novelty of colored illustrations , six in number , which add materially to its attractiveness .

		The chapters are appropriately headed with quotations from the H ^ vam ^ l. Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's third novel of
Colonial Virginia	LOCATION	, '' Audrey '' by name , does not seem to us equal to its predecessors .

		The vein shows signs of exhaustion , as is illustrated by a greater straining for effects , and a more liberal allowance of '' manners and customs . ''

		The period is that of the early seven - teenth century , and among the historical characters we meet
Colonel Byrd of Westover	ORGANIZATION	, whose literary remains have been brought into the author 's service .

		Audrey is a child rescued from the Indians by a young Virginian landed proprietor , and placed in the hands of a besotted minister .

		The rescuer goes to
England	LOCATION	for ten years , and returns to find that the child has been an uncomplaining sufferer from harsh treatment , and that she has grown to be a beautiful woman .

		How the hero struggles with his love for her , until in the end he throws pride to the winds and makes Audrey his wife , is the essential matter of the novel .

		One of the most successful figures in the book is that of his bondman , an un - reconciled Jacobite , who has vowed hatred to his master , and who is won over to love him by his kindliness and grave courtesy .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	has not forgotten how to purvey excitement for her readers , and many are the daring adventures and brave combats to be found in this , no less than in her other books .

		The flood of Colonial novels is unabated , and it is impossible to find room for mention of more than a few of the productions of this class .

		In addition to `` Audrey , '' two other exceptionally good examples are found among those recently published . ''

		The Strength of the Weak '' is a romance of
New France	LOCATION	in the days just preceding the Seven Years ' War -- the days of Bigot and
Vaudreuil	PERSON	in
Canada	LOCATION	, the days when
Braddock	PERSON	and
William Johnson	PERSON	were making a stir in the South .

		The leading characters are a young seigneur of English origin , and an American maiden in distress .

		Both are persecuted by the French villain of the story , and succeed , after many adventures , in escaping into
New York	LOCATION	.

		The adventures are of the familiar type , including a hairsbreadth escape from a besieged house , a perilous river and lake voyage , and the danger of pursuit by a wily and devilish Indian , the motive of whose course is unapparent .

		There is no end of sword-play , and the hero 's part therein is both valiant and magnanimous . ''

		The Colonials , '' by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	French , begins in the Indian country of the
West	LOCATION	, where we make the acquaintance of hero and heroine , in their nat - ural roles of rescuer and rescued .

		Then the scene shifts to
Boston	LOCATION	, and we have an interesting de - velopment of plot , with the tea-party , the Port Bill ,
Lexington	LOCATION	, Bunker Hill , and the British evacuation for a historical background .

		Mr.
French	PERSON	has done well to interest us at all in matter so hackneyed , but his story has abundant action , and the villain , with the usual persistence of his kind , escapes his dues long enough to keep the plot alive through five hundred pages .

		The historical part of the book is more minutely studied than is usually the case in romances of this sort , and might almost serve as a text-book for those three years of the annals of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		On two recent occasions , we have had the pleasure of indicating the remarkable literary qualities of the work of Father
Sheehan	PERSON	.

		In both prose and verse he has given evidence of an unusual degree of intellectual power and an unusual gift of style .

		The life of the parish priest in
Ireland	LOCATION	has rarely been portrayed with the sympathy of '' My New Curate , '' and the spiritual life has rarely been ex - pressed with the poetical beauty of ''
Cithara Mea	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A new book by Father
Sheehan	PERSON	must , then , receive some attention , and particularly a book which is evidently the most pretentious performance of its distinguished author .

		`` Luke Delmege '' is a novel of nearly six hundred pages .

		We say a novel , in default of a better term , for the life-history of a Catholic priest must get along without the elements of interest that chiefly appeal to the reader of novels .

		Obviously , it can not be a love-story , and must make up for this deprivation by the exhibition of other qualities sufficiently striking to justify its flaim to existence . ''

		Luke Delmege '' has such qualities in abundance , and holds the attention of its readers by its intimate revelation of the spiritual and in - tellectual life of its hero , and by its deep insight
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 into the Irish character , so lovable in certain aspects , so exasperating in others .

		Father
Luke	PERSON	, who be - gins his active life with the prestige of a first prize - man of
Maynooth	LOCATION	, is himself too intellectualized to understand the character of his fellow-countrymen , and it is only after a long and painful struggle that he comes to be a sharer in their sympathies and learns how to adapt himself to his environment .

		This he has nearly succeeded in doing , when death ends his career , finding him still , in his own words , '' a puzzled man . ''

		The extraordinary interest with which this life-history is invested by Father
Sheehan	PERSON	must be accounted for by the fact that he brings to its composition a mind richly stored with the results of modern culture , yet acutely sensitive to the spiritual , even when resting upon an irrational basis .

		The work has just enough of mysticism to lift it into a rarer atmosphere than that which men habit - ually breathe , and to bring into relief the symbolical aspects of those religious practices and beliefs which , narrowly considered , are apt to seem trivial , me - chanical , or grossly materialistic .

		Another novel in which the Catholic religion , rather than the individual actors , provides the chief element of interest is Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	's '' Casting of Nets . ''

		Here , however , we find little or nothing of the spiritual element , but rather a mesh of intrigue , hypocrisy , and underhanded deal - ing which may represent the practice of base indi - viduals in the Roman communion , but which we decline to accept as representative of the spirit of that organization .

		How proselytes are made by the arts of unscrupulous zealots is the theme of Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	's story , but his bias is too marked to make his story convincing .

		A young English woman of Catholic family is married to a Protestant nobleman , and her mind is so worked upon by her relatives and advisers that she becomes very un - happy at the thought of the religious differences existing between herself and her husband .

		In the struggle between her love and the conception of duty that is in a measure thus forced upon her , she suffers greatly , but her love triumphs in the end , and the falsity of what she had once thought to be duty is made clear to her conscience .

		This conclu - sion will be applauded by every right-minded reader , and we fancy that a Catholic of Father
Sheehan	PERSON	's type would be among those whose approval was the most earnest .

		The book has a certain neatness and decorum of expression , but is at the best a dull per - formance .

		Any single chapter of ''
Luke Delmege	PERSON	'' outweighs the whole volume of '' Casting of Nets . ''

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	Aid ^ is a pleasant novelist whose work is absolutely superficial . ''

		The Snares of the World '' is a story of modern English society , tricked out with most of the conventional trappings , and relieved only by one romantic episode which takes the heroine into unknown
Hungary	LOCATION	as the guest of a territorial magnate .

		Mr.
Aidd	PERSON	has recently made a trip to
Hungary	LOCATION	, and the oppor - tunity to give an account of his observations is too good to be missed , although this section of his work is quite out of keeping with the rest .

		There is neither genuine passion nor genuine characterization in this story , although both are doubtless attempted ; it is simply an agreeable and decorous tale of social life , revealing the polished man of the world rather than the literary artist .

		`` The Usurper , '' Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	's latest novel , is the story of an Englishman who , by a strange caprice of fortune in
Australia	LOCATION	, becomes the owner of property upon which valuable mineral deposits are discovered .

		He becomes a millionaire , returns to
England	LOCATION	, and engages in vast schemes of philanthropy .

		After a while , there appears upon the scene a man whom the hero believes to be the rightful owner of all the property -- the man whom he has long supposed to be dead .

		As a matter of fact , this unwelcome intruder is not the owner after all , but this does not appear until the end .

		Mean - while , the hero is face to face with the problem of abandoning his helpful work , and giving up his estate to a person of vicious life and worthless character .

		He temporizes , determines to keep his secret for a while , and go on with his enterprises .

		A dramatic climax is reached in a parliamentary campaign , when the hero , a candidate for election , is charged in a public meeting of his constituents with his seemingly fraudulent course .

		Believing the charge to be just , he admits its truth , and is about to retire in face of the scandal , when the real truth comes out , and his position becomes unim - peachable .

		Those who know Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's earlier work will understand how effective a story must have been made out of this material ; they will also be prepared for a slight overplus of sentimentality and a tendency toward a subdued sort of melodra - matic effect .

		Curiously enough , Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's `` Tris - tram of Blent '' has a plot that is identical , in the essentials , with that of the novel just described .

		Here also a man holds a large estate knowing that it is not rightfully his own ; here also the rightful heir is the woman whom he loves , and with whom his marriage , after many complications , provides a satisfactory disentanglement of the coil into which his fortunes have been twisted .

		In the case of Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's novel , the hero believes himself morally en - titled to the estate , and is determined to conceal the secret as long as possible , and to fight for his position if the secret shall ever be revealed .

		All these fine resolutions are , however , made futile by the appearance of the young woman on the scene , and , in an impulsive moment ,
Tristram	ORGANIZATION	abandons his position as resolutely as he has hitherto defended it .

		At the very end , he turns out to be the rightful owner after all , but he is shrewd enough to win his suit before revealing a fact which might pitch the heroine 's pride to the point of rejecting him forever .

		The whole of which story , with the many complica - tions and side-issues , is related with the most ad - mirable art ; Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's craftsmanship is almost unerring in fitting means to ends , and his characters are endowed with the very breath of life .

		248 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Mr.
Arthur W. Marchmont	PERSON	, the author of '' For Love or Crown , '' has written just the sort of story that we used to expect from Mr.
Hope	PERSON	, -- a story after the '' Zenda '' model , -- dealing with imaginary intrigues for the possession of an imaginary throne .

		The heroine is a girj of English training , who is in reality -- although she does not know it until she is grown up -- the legitimate successor to the rule of a petty German state .

		Meanwhile , she has given her heart into the keeping of a fine young Englishman , and persists in her allegiance after the discovery , although her ohstinacy upsets various dynastic calculations .

		In the end , she acts in such manner as to let it appear that her right of succes - sion is based upon an error , and thus virtually ab - dicates her crown for the sake of her affection .

		The story is among the better examples of the class to which it belongs , is provided with much exciting incident , and ends in a way which satisfies the ro - mantic soul of its readers .

		Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	's ''
Clementina	PERSON	'' is a sort of continuation of the ''
Parson Kelly	PERSON	'' which he wrote in collaboration with Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		It is a historical novel , with the
Stuart	PERSON	pretender and the Polish princess for its leading characters , nom - inally speaking , and the ingenious Mr.
Charles Wogan	PERSON	for its real hero .

		How this inventive Irish - man plans the royal marriage , and causes it to be consummated after incredible difficulties , including a rescue of the Princess
Clementina	PERSON	from her Austrian prison , is related in a manner which , if not convincing , at least leaves nothing to be desired upon the romantic side .

		The massacre of
St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	has been rather overworked of late by the romantic novelists , but Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	has ventured to make use of it in ' < Count Hannibal , '' his latest fiction .

		Instead , however , of saving it for the climax by his inven - tion , he starts out with it , and his plot is mainly developed out of the subsequent happenings .

		In this development he has resorted to a curious device .

		We begin with the conventional Huguenot lovers and their Catholic persecutor , who seeks the hand of the maiden and the destruction of the man .

		Presently , we notice that our sympathies are gradually be - coming estranged from the lover and attached to the persecutor .

		This process goes on by slow stages until the former is revealed as but a poor fellow after all , while the latter emerges clearly into view as the real hero .

		The heroine comes to take the same view of the matter , after a long struggle with herself , and finally learns to love her whilom enemy .

		This change of sentiment is most ingeniously managed , and successfully enlists our convictions .

		The story o # fers excellent entertainment , besides conveying a modicum of historical instruction .

		Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	has published so many hastily - written and slovenly novels during the past few years that it is something of a surprise to note the marked superiority of '' The Firebrand , '' his latest book .

		While not intending to praise this romance as in any sense a masterpiece , we will say that it is far above the author 's usual level , and well de - serving of attention .

		The scene is
Spain	LOCATION	in the thirties , and the struggle between Carlists and Cristinos provides the theme .

		A fiery young Scotch adventurer and soldier of fortune is the hero , while the heroine is a courageous Spanish coquette who at last finds in him her master , and whose quick and daring invention saves his life on more than one occasion .

		An attempt to carry the Queen and the child Princess away from
La Granja	LOCATION	, and to place them in the custody of Holy Church , provides the central subject of the plot .

		The story is told with much animation and variety of picturesque episode , and is unflagging in its interest .

		It is , moreover , the work of a close observer of Spanish life and character , of one at home amid the customs , the scenery , and the history of the
Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		Curiously enough , Mr.
Henry Seton Merriman	PERSON	's new novel , '' The Velvet Glove , '' is also a story of Carlist adventure , although in this case it is the movement of the seventies , not of the thirties , that engages our attention .

		The Jesuit is Mr.
Merri	PERSON	- man 's bHe noire , and he paints a dark picture of Jesuitical intrigue in behalf of the reactionary cause .

		A young girl , left an orphan and heiress to an im - mense fortune , occupies the centre of interest in the book , and we rejoice with the author when the hero outwits the schemers who aim to secure this fortune for the Carlist treasury .

		This he accomplishes by marrying the girl in secret , just as she is about to be forced into the religious life .

		He is a very un - Spanish lover in his self-restraint and lack of ardor , and the girl has some difficulty in discovering that he really cares for her , and has not married her for the sake of her fortune .

		Like all of Mr.
Merri	PERSON	- man 's stories , '' The Velvet Glove '' abounds in vivid descriptions , dramatic effects , and sententious phi - losophizings .

		There is a neglect of finish in some of the details that proves rather surprising , and a number of the minor incidents are left without their proper logical development .

		But the core of the plot is sound , and the half-dozen leading characters have a distinct individuality .

		Briefs on New Books .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	^ a ^ J readers will find a delightful onihe heroes of surprise in Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's latest the
Bruuh navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ `` Types of
Naval Officers	ORGANIZATION	drawn from the History of the British Navy '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		From its title , one might have expected to find the work rather technical in character , and instructive rather than entertaining to a layman .

		But it proves to be an interesting and stirring book , full of the charm that is given by heroic deeds described with clearness and spirit , and by noble characters portrayed with insight and discrimination as well as professional pride .

		A preliminary sketch gives an account of the condition of naval warfare at the beginning of the eighteenth J902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 century , and a general account of its subsequent developnaent during the century .

		By
1750	DATE	the spirit that had made the navy of
England	LOCATION	powerful during the stirring times of revolution had burnt itself out , and the material aims and sluggish peace of
Walpole	LOCATION	's time were reflected in the sluggishness and decay of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		A full account is given of this ine # Bciency under
Mathews	PERSON	and
Byng	ORGANIZATION	, to show , as the author says , the zero of the scale from which the navy was raised by the great admirals of whom the book treats to the glories of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's day .

		Not only
Mathews	PERSON	and
Byng	ORGANIZATION	, but also the officers of the later part of the century , show how habit and tra - dition carry the mass of men along , how little the activity of the average man is the result of inde - pendent thinking , how rare is the spark of intuition that marks genius .

		Regulations laid down specific methods of attack ; these must be followed , modi - fying conditions were not recognized , and so fleets were lost through what seems to a layman absolute stupidity in the form of inability to take advantage of circumstances .

		All of these inefficient men were brave ; but their dulness , intensified by the stupidity of the iron-clad regulations inherited from an earlier day of different methods under which they worked , reduced the British navy to the piti - able helplessness marked by the disaster of the un - fortunate Byng in
1756	DATE	.

		The same regulations continued in force ; but the man of brains and in - sight , in the person of
Hawke	LOCATION	, could ignore this * ' caricature of systematized tactics '' when need came , and wrest victories out of hostile odds .

		Even after such lessons , contemporary judgment attributed the failures to specific things , and not to the bad system and false tactical standards .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	says truly that no servitude is more helpless than that of unintelligent submission to an idea formally correct yet incomplete .

		After this portrayal of exist - ing conditions when the war of the Austrian Succes - sion broke out .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	takes up the study of the six great naval officers whose achievements added so much to the glory of
England	LOCATION	during the
latter half of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		Their names mean little to one who is not well read in naval history , but they are well worth knowing , and this book will do good service in bringing them before the reading public in an attractive way .

		The six names are
Hawke	PERSON	, who typifies the spirit of the new methods ;
Rodney	PERSON	, the form ;
Howe	PERSON	, the gen - eral officer , as tactician ;
Jervis	ORGANIZATION	, the general officer , as disciplinarian and strategist ; Saumarez , the fleet officer and division commander ; and
Pellew	PERSON	, the frigate captain and partisan officer .

		Each of these sturdy and efficient sailors and fighters is carefully portrayed , and his special influence upon the devel - opment of the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	is traced .

		In his book on ''
Ruskin	PERSON	and the English Lakes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the Rev.
H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	has furnished a supplementary volume to his earlier works , '' Life and Nature at the English Lakes '' and '' Literary
Ruskin	PERSON	and the Englith Lake region .

		Associations of the English Lakes , '' as well as to CoUingwood 's '' Life and Work of
John Ruskin	PERSON	. ''

		The present volume will be of interest to all
Ruskin	PERSON	disciples ; it treats of recent events , and is the ex - pression of one who is a very genuine admirer of his subject , if somewhat over-emotional in his style .


Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	records
Ruskin	PERSON	's various visits to the Lakes from his earliest childhood , showing the impressions made on the growing boy by mountains , woods , and water , -- impressions finally culminat - ing in an affection so strong that when , after a severe illness , he felt the need of a restful retreat he purchased
Brantwood	PERSON	for his future home .

		His love for this beautiful region , thus early formed , never left him ; and on every trip abroad in his after-life his letters expressed his homesickness and longing for the home of his heart , where he lived so long and where he finally died .

		The home-life at
Brantwood	LOCATION	is described as being very simple , but beautified by the love of friends ; the cottage was always a peaceful haven ior a much over - worked and much suffering man .


Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	gives a chapter to the
Ruskin Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	which took place at
Coniston Institute	ORGANIZATION	in the
summer of 1901	DATE	, and describes many of the pictures -LRB- about two hundred in all -RRB- , and some of the articles associ - ated with
Ruskin	PERSON	that added interest to the exhibit .

		The chapter entitled < *
Ruskin	PERSON	and the Home Art Industries in the Lake District '' describes the Kes - wick School of Industrial Art and the
Ruskin Linen Industry	ORGANIZATION	, their beginnings , development , and work .

		These industries were inspired by
Ruskin	PERSON	's teach - ings , and were encouraged by his messages while he lived ; they have accomplished much in the way of beautiful and honest work , and have provided happy employment for many humble folks , some of whom have developed unsuspected talent .

		Some forty pages are given to showing how much
Ruskin	PERSON	had in common with
Wordsworth	PERSON	, in spite of his occasional dissenting words .

		The book contains several illustrations from photographs , and is fur - nished with an index .


Maryland	LOCATION	as a
Proprietary Province	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rich materials of American co - lonial life and history have afforded many excellent subjects for special investigation by graduate students in our universi - ties , and none better than that selected by Mr.
Newton D. Mereness	PERSON	, a fellow in
Columbia	LOCATION	, the results of whose labors appear in a dissertation on ''
Maryland	LOCATION	as a Proprietary Province , '' now pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The charter granted to Lord
Baltimore	LOCATION	conferred upon him great pow - ers , -- perhaps the greatest ever given by an English king to a subject , -- and at the same time it re - stricted him by three brief clauses which forbade the taking away '' the right or interest of any per - son , or persons , of , or in member , life , freehold , goods or chattels , '' provided that the laws and or - dinances should be reasonable and , so far as con - venient , like the laws and customs of
England	LOCATION	, and declared that the people of
Maryland	LOCATION	should be 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, entitled to all the privileges and franchisea and liberties which other English subjects enjoyed .

		This particular doctor 's thesis shows how the people , through their representatives , gradually encroached upon the powers of the proprietary , until , when the time came for transition from colony to common - wealth after the Declaration of Independence , the people were practically supreme in every depart - ment of government .

		The volume contains a vast amount of material illustrating the political , eco - nomic , religious , military , and social history of the province in colonial days ; and because of the pe - culiar nature of the feudal grants made to the pro- prietor , and the mixed population , religion being considered , there is much interest in following out the various phases of
Maryland	LOCATION	's life .

		The accom - panying bibliography indicates the richness of
Maryland	LOCATION	as a field for investigation , and suggests gratification that the beginnings of our national life are being so carefully studied by earnest workers .

		Afatnctu romance of hUtory .

		In '' The Diamond Necklace '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB-
Frantz Funck-Brentano	PERSON	, through his translator , Mr.
H. Suth	PERSON	- erland
Edwards	PERSON	, gives us an account of the famous episode of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	's downfall , in the clear light thrown upon it by recently-discovered docu - ments .

		Regarding the affair as explicable only when considered as the result of strange personali - ties played on by one another , the author intro - duces in succession the various collaborators -- Mme. de la Motte the intriguer ,
Cardinal Rohan	PERSON	the dupe , Cagliostro the riddle , and Queen
Marie	PERSON	herself , who , without part or profit in the transaction , yet had to suffer its worst consequences .

		Then follows a vivid picture of the trial , as it went on in and out of court ; and a statement of the verdict rendered by court and populace .

		The very complicated in - trigue is presented in a remarkably clear and inter - esting manner , the interpretation of the facts is convincing , and the moot - point -- the possibility that
Rohan	PERSON	, man of the world as he was , should be in some matters a credulous child -- is very satis - factorily accounted for .

		There is constant emphasis on the light which the affair throws on the mind and heart of pre-revolutionary
France	LOCATION	.

		Being thus taken as typical , it assumes a wider interest and justifies the extended treatment which at first thought seemed disproportionate to its importance .

		TwoofPMarMs ^ r.
Bemadotte Perrin	PERSON	, professor of `` Lives '' in a Greek in
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, has ap - neto translation .

		proached his task in translating and elucidating `` Plutarch 's Themistocles and Aristides '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- with a mingled spirit of modern scholar - ship and veneration for the old biographer and moralist which makes the volume doubly grateful .

		The translation of the two '' Lives '' serves as a basis for a preface , a series of four introductions , critical and historical , and voluminous notes , which together form more than three-fourths of the book 's contents .

		Dr.
Perrin	PERSON	's rendering into English is a happy adaptation of the two great translations of Plutarch , -- North 's , and the one called
Dryden	PERSON	's , -- with the necessary differences . ''

		I have not tried , '' says Dr.
Perrin	PERSON	in his preface , '' to write a learned book for the learned , but one which may attract an ordinary English reader of culture and taste toward learning . ''

		Yet there is food for the learned , too , in the various apparatus with which the work of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	is here surrounded .

		All that is known of the man himself , all that is known of the men of whom he writes , and of their times , has been fully digested and set in order for the enlighten - ment of those who must always find the finest of inspirations in the careers of such men as Themis - tocles and Aristides .

		It may be hoped that this book will serve as the introductory volume in a series which will include all of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's heroes and fellow-countrymen .

		The biography '' ^ long with the current of interest in of a sturdy historical fiction , there seems to be an English Saint .

		allied interest in biography .

		Readers of an imaginative representation of by-gone times may reasonably wish later for a true portrayal of the real life lived in those times , a portrayal that shall have in some degree the like coloring of the strange , the remote , and the romantic .

		Such a biography is that by Mr.
C. L. Marson	PERSON	, entitled ''
Hugh	PERSON	, Bishop of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, a Short Story of one of the Makers of Mediseval England '' -LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green ^ & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Devoted as he was to ecclesiasticism and veneration of relics , the good bishop , who was the terror of three terrible kings ,
Henry	ORGANIZATION	,
Richard	PERSON	, and
John	PERSON	, is interesting for the possession of that strange thing in the mediaeval world , a sturdy common - sense .

		This , joined with as sturdy a will , made
Hugh	PERSON	a man to accomplish things , a man to uphold right-living in a time when morality was lax .

		The feeling of the common people that disaster and death would at once overtake those whom he ex - communicated , and the frequent fulfilment of the fear , give striking illustration of the dominant per - sonality of the man .

		The book is written in a style that quaintly touches off the nawe simplicity of the hero , whether as architect developing the early English style , or as ecclesiastical statesman checking the too arrogant power of the crown .

		Whether from modesty in thinking that the brief hundred and seventy pages of the volume did not require it , or from a less commendable reason , th '' author erred in not providing an index .

		A colossal history of English counties .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American agents for '' The Victoria .

		History of the Counties of
England	LOCATION	'' -- a publishing enterprise of great dignity and fairly colossal scope .

		Each county is to have from two to eight volumes , making in all a series of one hundred and sixty .

		The subscription for this work is
twelve dollars	MONEY	a volume , which amounts , with a discount of ten per cent , to
$ 1728	MONEY	for the entire work .

		In addition , there will be a supplementary
1902	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 251 volume for each county , published at
thirty-five dollars	MONEY	, containing the pedigrees of the present county faoailies , and illustrating the arms of the families which are mentioned in the Visitations .

		A specimen volume of the work is now before us -- being the first of the six treating of the County of
Norfolk	LOCATION	-- and bears out all that is claimed by the publishers .

		It is an account of the natural history and archaeology of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and the chapters are the work of eminent specialists .

		The illustrations are numerous , including half a dozen maps and a number of full-page plates .

		Among the matters to be dealt with in later volumes are the many phases of historical development , heraldry and pedigrees , architecture , education , agriculture , and sport .

		Among the departmental editors we note the names of Professor
W. Boyd Dawkins	PERSON	, Mr.
G. Lawrence Gomme	PERSON	, Mr.
R. L. Poole	PERSON	, and Mr.
J. H. Round	PERSON	.

		Mr.
H. Arthur Doubleday	PERSON	is the general editor of the work .

		It was a happy chance which led SpanmMain .

		^ ^ -
Mowbray Morris	PERSON	to writing his '' Tales of the Spanish Main '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Between the covers of a single book he has brought together nearly all the incidents which made Spanish America and the water routes thereto the most interesting part of the world for nearly two centuries .

		The voyage of
Columbus	LOCATION	, with which the volume opens , is well told ; but its interest , and that of the discovery of the
Pacific	LOCATION	which succeeds it , is soon dimmed by the exploits of that gallant band of
South Britons	LOCATION	, --
Drake	PERSON	,
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Gren	PERSON	- ville , and others .

		The immortal story of '' The Revenge '' is told anew , and will be welcome , for all the brilliancy of the writers who have told it before .

		More than a third of the book is occupied with the deeds of the bucanneers , ending ` with
Morgan	PERSON	, the greatest of them all .

		A final chapter might have been added , dealing with the exploits of
William Walker	PERSON	in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, -- that curious survival of seventeenth century methods in the nineteenth century ; but
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	is a fitting char - acter to bring the volume to a climax .

		These are brave stories of brave days , and bravely told .

		The increasing interest felt by Amer - ZZZZai Yaw . '

		• ' ^ ^ ^ ^ '' * ^ f questions growing out of our new international relations is doubtless the occasion for the recent issue of a manual on the subject , written by Messrs.
George G. Wilson	PERSON	, Ph.D. , and
George F. Tucker	PERSON	, Ph.D. , and published by
Messrs. Silver	ORGANIZATION	,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The authors present their work as a '' brief intro - duction '' to the subject ; but it ia of suflBcient ful - ness to justify us in calling it a manual .

		While the authors do not attempt any new analysis of their subject , its various phases are presented so fully and so clearly as to make this one of the most useful manuals now in print .

		The work seems to be offered by the compilers primarily for the use of students .

		We regard it as no less useful and inter - esting to the general reader , by reason of the easy diction employed , and we expect to see it take rank as a popular treatise on the general subject .

		A voluminous appendix presents the
United States Military and Naval Codes	ORGANIZATION	of War , the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Brussels Codes of Land Warfare	ORGANIZATION	, and other like documents , germane to the text .

		Swis * life in That pleasant little series , '' Our European Neighbours '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , town and country , .

		\ ° lo is enriched by Mr.
Alfred T. Story	PERSON	's account of '' Swiss Life in Town and Country . ''

		Like its forerunners , this new volume succeeds in giving an adequate conception of the manner in which the inhabitants of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, whatever their faith or speech , do their duties in this world , and takes its readers into places remote from the tourist 's tread and away from the familiar paths of history .

		There is no phase of the lives of these sturdy republicans , whether social or political , which Mr.
Story	PERSON	does not touch upon , and an abundance of illustrations drawn from unhackneyed subjects add to the value of the book .

		The most noteworthy aspect of the work will be found in the spirit of freedom which vivifies it , the author enter - ing fully into the heroism of the daily existence of these humble people who govern themselves so ad - mirably in spite of threatening nature and of neighboring nations committed to monarchical policies .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The '' Historic Waterways '' of Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, published in
1890	DATE	, was a charming account of a series of canoeing trips down three rivers of Wis - consin and
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		The work of a pleasing writer , who was at the same time a specialist in the history of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, it appealed to the student no less than to the casual reader in search of ideas for a
summer	DATE	outing , and enjoyed a deserved success .

		The work has now been reissued by Messrs. A ,
C. MeClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and is called ```` Down Historic Waterways , '' a slight change of title for which there is no evident reason , and which librarians will not applaud .

		Eight photo - graphic plates of typical scenery along the rivers des - cribed are now added to the work , notably increasing its attractiveness .

		Merely to know the story of a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's is not , perhaps , to know much of what
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has to tell us , and yet for various reasons there are doubt - less many who will be glad to know so much without knowing more .

		For them '' Shakespeare in Tale and Verse '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Lois G. HufEord	PERSON	, will prove attractive .

		The book makes no pretense of schol - arship , but gives evidence , none the less , of a nicely sure understanding of the plays .

		The stories are told in prose , liberally supplemented by quotations from the plays ; so that the young reader will have the difficul - ties cleared away and will at the same time feed on many of the nobler lines of the poet .

		The volume contains fifteen of the plays , a fairly adequate number for young readers .

William E. Waters	PERSON	, of Professor Fried - lander 's '' Stadtewesen in Italien im Erster Jahrhan - dert , '' first published more than twenty years ago . ''


Barry Lyndon	PERSON	, '' in a single volume , is added to the delightful Dent-Macmillan edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	's prose works , now in course of publication .

		Mr.
Walter Jer	PERSON	- rold supplies a bibliographical note to the volume , and there are ten of Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	's characteristic draw - ings .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a school edition of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's `` Commentaries on the Gallic War '' which leaves nothing to be desired in the way of help - ful illustration and apparatus .

		It is the joint work of Professors
Albert Harkness	PERSON	and
Charles H. Forbes	PERSON	.

		A series of colored plates contributes greatly to the value of this text .

		`` The Question of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, '' published by Mr.
George F. Lasher	PERSON	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, is an English transla - tion of a work by Dr.
Victor M. Maurtua	PERSON	, dealing with the complicated relations and controversies between

Washington	LOCATION	. ''

		A Political Primer of
New York City	LOCATION	and
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Miss Adele M. Fielde	PERSON	, is a publication of the
New York League for Political Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		This little book is designed for the information of voters and the mak - ing of intelligent citizens , and offers an example of practical educational activity that other cities would do well to imitate .

		The `` Antigone '' of Sophocles is soon to be presented in the original Greek at the
Leland Stanford Junior University	ORGANIZATION	, and , as the presentation of a Greek tragedy has never before been undertaken on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, much interest is manifested in academic and artistic circles .

		It is not unlikely that , in addition to the per - formances at the
University	ORGANIZATION	, a presentation in
San Francisco	LOCATION	will be called for .

		In scenic arrangements the conditions of the ancient theatre will be reproduced as nearly as may be , and the choral odes will be sung to
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's music .

		The '' Standard Socialist Series '' is a collection of small books published by Messrs.
Charles H. Kerr	PERSON	& Co Three volumes now before us comprise : `` The American Farmer , '' by Mr.
A. M. Simons	PERSON	; '' Collectivism and Industrial Evolution , '' by

E. Untermann	PERSON	.

		A second series of Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's `` Miscel - lanies '' is published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The subjects are mainly from that eighteenth century m which Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	lives in the spirit , and comprise eight `` essays and introductions . ''

		To these are ap - pended nearly a hundred pages of verse , mostly of the occasional or votive sort , so that the volume really gives us a new collection of Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's ever-welcome and ever-graceful poems .

		Attention is again called by the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	to the
Justin Winsor	PERSON	prize of one bundred dollars , offered annually for a monograph m the field of American history .

		There are practically no limitations set upon the choice of subject .

		About one hundred pages of print are required , and the treatment must be strictly critical and scientific .

		Professor
Charles M. Andrews	PERSON	,
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, is the proper person to ad - dress for information .

		Mr.
James FuUarton Muirhead	PERSON	's `` America : The Land of Contrasts , '' is republished by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	in a second edition , less expensive than was the original one .

		Mr.
Muirhead	PERSON	, it will be remembered , is the writer of the
Baedeker	LOCATION	guides to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, and is thus an expert observer of Amer - ican life The book is a valuable commentary upon our civilization , kindly in tone , yet not afraid of being critical when criticism is called for .

		Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	,
Boston	LOCATION	, will shortly issue for private subscribers a series of diminutive volumes to be called `` The Breviary Treasures , '' comprising many rare gems of literature .

		There will be ten vol - umes in all , printed on Dutch handmade paper by the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, and illustrated and decorated under the personal direction of Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	.

		Ihe edi - tion will be strictly limited to the number of subscrip - tions for the complete set received by Mr.
Dole	PERSON	up to the
15th of this month	DATE	.

		Among recent revivals of popular old works of fic - tion , we note with pleasure a new edition of the histor - ical romances of
William Harrison Ainsworth	PERSON	.

		Al - though
Ainsworth	PERSON	was not one of the masters of this form of composition , he knew how to construct an ex - cellent story , and was not undeserving of his vogue .

		This new `` Windsor '' edition bears the imprint of the Messrs.
Gibbings	PERSON	, and is sold in this country by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes are prettily printed and illustrated , and will number twenty in all .

		We ^ ^ now have on our table two volumes of `` Windsor Castle , two of '' The Tower of
London	LOCATION	, '' and one of '' St.
James	PERSON	s. Doctoral theses get printed in various ways .

		Some - times they are books like others , sometimes they are publications of the learned societies , sometimes they 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, are individualistic nondescripts as far as their form of issue is concerned .

		Just now we have in our hands a thesis which conaes from the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	, and is extracted from a report of the
Bureau of Amer	ORGANIZATION	- ican Ethnology of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution .

		Its subject is ````
The Wild Rice Gatherers	ORGANIZATION	of the Upper Lakes , '' and it is submitted by Dr.
Albert Ernest Jenks	PERSON	to the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		With its gen - erous size of page and its numerous photographic plates , it presents a rather imposing appearance , and should make other candidates for the doctorate emulous of this substantial form of publication .

Brandes	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bjornson	PERSON	, are readily suggested as among the reasons for the wide interest in the subject .

		BRIEFER MENTION 283 NOTES 284 LIST OF NEW BOOKS , ... 285 THE FUNCTION OF THE NEGRO COLLEGE .

		There is at the present time so widespread a discouragement of the higher education of colored youth , that it might seem absurd to discuss the contents of a curriculum the wis - dom of whose very existence is seriously called in queston .

		One is reminded of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's men in the forests of
Africa	LOCATION	, who , when threatened with starvation , amused themselves by com - posing fancy bills-of-fare containing choice
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean viands .

		In proposing a scheme of education for the Negro , we should mainly consider -LRB- 1 -RRB- the edu - cational constants which admit of no variation on account of ethnic peculiarities , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the aptitude and social situation of the class pre - scribed for .

		The ground-work of education can not be modified to meet the variant de - mands of race or color , previous conditions or present needs .

		The general processes of dis - cipline and culture must form a fixed and un - alterable part of any adequate educational pro- gramme .

		On the other hand , there is quite a wide latitude of accommodation for special needs and social circumstances in what might be called the practical aspect of education .

		There has recently sprung up a class of edu - cational philosophers who would restrict the term '' practical education '' to those forms of knowledge or formulas of information which can be converted into cash equivalent on de - mand .

		The truth is , that all knowledge which enables the recipient to do with added effi - ciency the work which falls to his lot in this world , whether that work be tilling the soil or plying a handicraft , healing the sick or enlight - ening the ignorant , uplifting the lowly or ad - ministering spiritual solace , is '' practical '' in the highest and best significance of that term .

		In an ideal system of education , no two per - sons would receive identical treatment .

		There is always a wide margin of individual aptitude or predilection .

		It is no disparagement of any class to say that its needs differ from those of another class .

		The curricula of our Negro colleges were taken bodily from the best
New England	LOCATION	schools of thirty years ago ; and in view of the fact that these prototypes have been radically modified by the urgency of present 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, day demands , it ought not to be surprising if they prove for the Negro to be a slight mis-fit .

		The trend of educational tendency is more and more toward the practical things of the pres - ent .

		The introduction of the elective system -LRB- has been influenced mainly by this motive .

		The wisely directed youth pursues his academic course with direct reference to the end in view , as steadily as the hunter keeps his sight level on his game .

		Traditional branches of study have lost much of their talismanic value .

		The so-called higher education is no longer con - fined to the classic tongues of two famous far - off peoples .

		The pedagogical watch-word is method rather than subject-matter .

		The higher method of inquiry and investigation can be ap - plied to the growing roots of living plants as well as to the dry stems of a dead language .

		The problems growing out of the population of
Alabama	LOCATION	or
Florida	LOCATION	are as intricate in their re - lation and as far-reaching in their consequence , and , withal , as important a subject for study , as any ever involved in the European penin - sulas .

		Courses of study intended for colored stu - dents should be interpretable in terms of their needs and obvious mission .

		The chief function of the educated Negro is to disseminate knowl - edge , in simplified form , among the masses of his race .

		Productive scholarship will hardly ■ fall to his lot for many generations to come .

		This is not said in disparagement of his ability , but because of his limited range of opportu - nity , and his proscriptive circumstances .

		Schol - arship thrives by social stimulus , leisure , cultivated contact , or affiliation with great in - `` titutions .

		None of these conditions applies to the Negro at the present time .

		No one can ■ doubt that there are individual members of the • colored race who take rank with the best Aryan youth according to any approved test of capa - city .

		But when the two take their respective places in society , they go up and down on the scale of opportunity , as two figures of equal intrinsic value gain or lose in power by their local setting on different sides of the separatrix in the decimal notation .

		The educated Negro youth , then , is not to explore , but to interpret and apply .

		He must partake of the mysteries of knowledge , and show them unto the masses in such simple forms as they can understand and utilize .

		But if this is to be the chief mis - sion of the educated Negro , why waste time and money in initiating him in '' the traditional culture of the Aryan race '' ?

		It is well known that in order to interpret a formula to others .

		one must have a knowledge of its underlying principles as well as a practical facility of manipulation .

		It is conceivable that a sea captain might be able to determine the bear - ings of his ship , without understanding the mathematical mysteries of astronomy and geodesy ; but he would make a very poor teacher of the principles of navigation .

		The attempt to apply formulas without basal knowl - edge leads to the embarrassment of the ship 's captain who was also ambitious to play the role of physician .

		He carried on his voyage a medical chest filled with drugs to be admin - istered by number according to well-known symptomatic indications .

		The complaint of a sailor called clearly for No. 15 ; but that drug being exhausted , the good captain ad - ministered a compound of Nos. 7 and 8 , with the result that the patient died .

		It is especially dangerous to equip members of a backward race with the forms and ter - minology of a higher civilization , and send them forth as guides and philosophers of the masses .

		There is a lack of that steadiness and poise which come from heredity and the sobering influence of rational environment .

		The result is apt to be sham shallowness and showy pretence .

		The blind led by the blind are , to say the least , as fortunate as the blind led by the bigoted .

		The writer has seen a circular issued by a young man , scarcely thirty years of age , the sum total of whose knowledge would be scarcely equal to that of a
Yale	ORGANIZATION	sophomore , who advertises himself as Rev. ,
A.M.	LOCATION	,
B.D.	LOCATION	, Ph.D. ,
D.D.	LOCATION	.

		It is more than likely that the majority of the con - gregation of this over-bedecked preacher can neither read nor write .

		What these humble people need is sound knowledge and simple sense .

		The social separation of the races in Amer - ica renders it imperative that the professional classes among the Negroes should be recruited from their own ranks .

		Under ordinary cir - cumstances , professional places are filled by the most favored members of the most favored class in the community .

		In a Latin or Cath - olic country , where the fiction of '' social equal - ity '' does not exist , there is felt no necessity for Negro priest , teacher , or physician , to ad - minister to his own race .

		But in
America	LOCATION	this is conceded to be a social necessity .

		Such being the case , the Negro leader , to use a familiar term , requires all the professional equipment of his white confrere , and a special knowledge of the needs and circumstances of
1902	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 269 his race in addition .

		The teacher of the Negro child , the preacher of a Negro congre - gation , or the physician to Negro patients , certainly require as much professional knowl - edge and skill as those who administer to the corresponding needs of the white race .

		Nor are the i-equirements of the situation one whit diminished because the bestower is of the same race as the recipient .

		Those who argue that the money and effort already bestowed upon the higher education of the Negro have been wasted , not only shut their eyes to the value of demonstrated results , but show a shallow knowledge of sociological exactions .

		For professional needs alone , the situation calls for at least one well-educated person in every two hundred of the Negro population .

		There is no provision whereby these persons can be qualified for their function except through the much-abused Negro college .

		The mere rudiments of knowledge and practical handicraft , as useful as these are in their place and for their purpose , can not qualify the re - cipient for the higher function , which is of equal , or rather of superior , importance .

		The curriculum of the Negro college should embrace those subjects which lead -LRB- 1 -RRB- to dis - cipline , -LRB- 2 -RRB- to culture , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- to a knowl - edge of the facts and factors of racial life .

		The two main points of variance from the ordinary curriculum should be the inclusion of racial knowledge and the practical exclusion of speculative branches .

		One need not be a disciple of
Auguste Comte	PERSON	, with a one-sided leaning to things positive , to appreciate the fact that such subtle subjects , for lack of defi - nite setting and statement , are apt to bewilder and confuse rather than to simplify and eluci - date .

		They lead too far away from the lowly life of the masses , in terms of which all useful knowledge must be interpretable .

		Negro youth need training in exactitude of thought .

		No one who is acquainted with the race can fail to be impressed with its loose and slovenly modes of reasoning .

		The fanciful and flighty , the ornate and extravagant , are given prefer - ence over the straightforward and direct .

		This erratic tendency can be corrected , to a great extent , by the rigid discipline of the ele - mentary mathematics , which demand a simple , straightforward , candid , unwavering method of procedure in order to reach the required result .

		What has been said about habits of thought will apply also to plans and methods of work , -- or , better still , to ways of handling things .

		The Negro has never engaged in pur - suits that demanded nice adaptation of means to ends .

		His methods , therefore , are awkward and clumsy .

		The Negro workman is regarded as simply '' a hand , '' -- neither the intellect nor the sensibilities nor the will being demanded in the accomplishment of his crude task .

		Hence , a form of training which requires the cooperation of bodily and mental faculties be - comes a prime prerequisite .

		The value of such training , it will be conceived , is wholly indifferent to the special vocation which the student may follow in after life .

		For science , method , and skill are equally demanded in all callings if one would gain efficiency and suc - cess .

		Herein consists the strong argument for industrial education .

		But the laboratory method , which has been introduced in almost every department of science , has robbed so - called industrial training of much of its exclu - sive educational value .

		Work in wood and iron and in the mechanical trades furnishes by no means the only facility of dealing with con - crete problems , or of applying thought to things .

		A course in chemistry requires as much deftness as a course in carpentry .

		In botany , zooolgy , and physics , the student works out results according to formulated plan as surely as does the mechanic in a machine-shop .

		The Negro college , then , needs to lay added stress upon the scientific side of the work .

		This is the weak spot in most of such institu - tions .

		Rational enjoyment through moderation is perhaps as good a definition as can be given of '' culture . ''

		The Negro race is characterized by boisterousness of manners and extravagant forms of taste .

		As if to correct such deficien - cies , their higher education hitherto has been largely concerned with Greek and Latin liter - ature , the norms of modern culture .

		The ad - vanced Negro student became acquainted with Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	before he had read Shakes - peare and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		It is just here that our edu - cational critics are apt to become excited .

		The spectacle of a Negro wearing eye-glasses , and declaiming in classic phases about '' The walls of lofty
Rome	LOCATION	'' and '' The wrath of Achilles , '' upsets their critical balance and composure .

		We have so often listened to the grotesque incongruity of a Greek chorus and a greasy cabin , and the relative value of a piano and a patch of potatoes , that if we did not join in the smile in order to encourage the humor , we should do so out of sheer weariness .

		And yet we dare affirm that the study of 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Latin and Greek has had a wholesome influ - ence in starting lofty ideals and stimulating noble aspiration among the Negro peoples .

		Of course , Negro schools must share in the gen - eral relative decline of classic studies .

		But it would be a sad day for the race if its youth were shut out from the treasury of cultural wealth contained in the storehouse of classical literature .

		While
the Negro	ORGANIZATION	college has many features in common with the academic world in general , its chief distinctive function is to direct and dominate the higher life of the race .

		The Negro is in a peculiar sense dependent upon the school for the higher forms and nobler modes of life .

		The school is , or has been , well-nigh the only diffusive source of light .

		The curriculum , therefore , should be concerned largely with the conditions of that life whose destiny it is its chief function to influence .

		These colleges should be centres of social knowledge , where men of consecration and of sound discernment should speak the word needful with such sim - plicity and sense that the people would hear them gladly .

		This would be in no sense a derogation of academic dignity ; for knowledge which ultimates in social service reaches its highest effective level .

		Sociology is fast becoming a staple part of our college curricula .

		The Negro problem just now is of supreme sociological importance .

		Dr.
Alderman	PERSON	, in a recent number of '' The Out - look , '' has set forth with much point and pith the value of this branch of study to the white youth of the South .

		What was there said con - cerning the importance of this subject to
South	LOCATION	- ern white youth applies also , or rather all the more , to Negro youth .

		Of course we can not fol - low Dr.
Alderman	PERSON	when he says that the edu - cation of one white man is worth more to the Negro race than the education of ten blacks , -- any more than we should agree with the asser - tion that the feeding and clothing of one white man is of more importance to the Negro than like benefits bestowed upon a dozen members of his own race .

		To put the proposition in a con - crete form , it devolves upon Dr.
Alderman	PERSON	to point out any particular white man whose scholastic training would be worth more to the Negro race than that of
E. R. Wright	PERSON	or
W. E. B. DuBois	PERSON	.

		Every Negro who assumes leadership has to deal with vital sociological questions .

		Those who must direct others along lines of civic duty and social righteousness should have some formal training as to the factors with which they must deal .


Atlanta University	ORGANIZATION	, through its chair of sociology and the publications pro- ceeding from its annual conferences , is meeting this requirement in a commendable measure .

		Aside from this , and some simple sociological work recently inaugurated at
Howard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , there seem to be no other Negro col - leges working along these lines .

		The motto inscribed over the entrance to the temple at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	conveys a special meaning to the Negro student of the present day -- '' Know Thyself . ''

		The true principle of education would carry the pupil outside of himself and the narrow circle of selfish interests to the contemplation of questions of universal import and world - wide consequence ; on the other hand , he should not be allowed to roam so far a-field that he can not be instantly recalled , if need be , to the things that appertain to his own environment .

		The curricula of Negro colleges should pre - serve a just balance between these principles .

		THE
LO ST TE ACHER	ORGANIZATION	.

		Are we so method-mad that we are beginning to leave out the personal equation in our educational problem ?

		Or is there really no place in our hard and elaborate system for aught except machinery ?

		Where are our great teachers ?

		Where can we find the light , the force , the blood , the spirit , the at - mosphere , which those of us who have reached ma - ture years remember so well from our early school experiences ?

		This was the true individualism in ed - ucation , -- not the kind that you may dig up out of the desert of a text-book , or from the cant phrase , growing more inconsequent at every repetition , that you hear tossed from the lips of one educator to another .

		These were the makers of men .

		You can not go anywhere in English history without meeting them .

		They show against the horizon figures as clear-cut as poet , or statesman , or fighting man .

		You turn over the old pages and come across the old Homeric pictures that put heart into us all :
Bede	PERSON	, and
Wycliffe	PERSON	, and Ascham , and many an - other both wise and gentle ;
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	, stand - ing in the dusk of Rugby chapel , a throng of young faces upturned toward him ;
Edward Benson	PERSON	, bid - ding farewell to his soldiers ' sons in the gloom of a rainy autumn afternoon ; Dr.
Coit	PERSON	, churchman , scholar , gentleman ; Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	, that large-fibred , fiery soul , the glory and the crown of
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		The slovenly and indefinite can not compass suc - cess , and therefore it is certain that these men did not approach their teaching in a haphazard fashion ; yet , whatever method or system they employed was
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 subservient to their own personality , and behind each method glowed the aagast and militant soul of the master .

		Their deepest interests were not with things but with humanity .

		Such a man , teaching history , shall deliver an apostolic message to his pupils .

		The story of a race shall be to them a large rendering of the story of life ; and literature , with its subtleties and poetries of an ampler speech , and with its clarity of vision , shall be a re-telling of the narrative .

		And each daily task shall prove itself to be made of the same stuff out of which are woven the divine toils of heaven .

		We follow men , not things .

		Life is first of all a question of teachers .

		It deals elementally , not with a series of mental processes by which certain data are stored in the mind , but with the great fact of character , with those myriad delicate yet virile sub - stances that reach out and grasp the immortal man .

		Vital contact with life , with the world , in other words , with those teeming forces that tend to cre - ate a robust man or woman , is the chief necessity of maturing youth .

		Set such a robust personality before it , and it will recognize a leader , a warm , strong presence , to which it may bring its aspira - tions and inspirations , and to which , in other and harder years , it shall be indebted for a regenerating influence .

		Are text-books , and
summer	DATE	courses , and peda - gogical pamphlets and methods , to be pushed to the front , and the teacher to the rear ?

		Are our schools , public and private , our conventions both state and national , to discuss papers on spelling , and papers on geography , and papers on mathematics , with theory upon theory concerning the whole curric - ulum of study , and be void of one sound , whole - some , downright word in regard to what is above and beyond all these ?

		Drill , routine , mental adroitness , photographic attention to detail , are serviceable things in their way , and he who fails to recognize their value takes but a parochial view of education ; yet none of these strikes at the heart of the matter .

		It is personality that does this ; for that only can guide , lead , and control .

		A machine , expert though it be , has the defects of machinery .

		Through some cog , or crank , or wheel within a wheel , through the little more or the little less in its multitudinous wires and coils , it may prove both inexorable and ineffectual in a moment of direst need .

		But character remains .

		The beginning and the end of education is the teacher .

		There are no flowers of rhetoric , and yet one suspects it is not always a plain , unvarnished tale he sets before the reader .

		272 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, serving as lieutenant under General Craufurd , he says : '' Many are the hairbreadth escapes my Hussars and I had , for we were very daring ; we were never two nights in the same place .

		One night at
Villa de Ciervo	LOCATION	, where we were watching a ford over the
Agueda	LOCATION	, two of my vedettes -LRB- two Poles elegantly mounted -RRB- deserted to the enemy .

		The old sergeant , a noble soldier , came to me in great distress .

		< O mein
Gott	PERSON	, upstand and jump up your horse ; she will surely be here directly ! '

		I was half asleep , with my horse 's reins in my hand , and roared out , * Who the devil is she f ' * The Fran - zosen , mein
Herr	PERSON	.

		Two d -- d schelms have deserted . '

		... At daylight we saw fifty French dragoons wend - ing their way on the opposite bank to the ford .

		I immediately got hold of the padre and alcalde -LRB- priest and magistrate -RRB- , and made them collect a hundred vil - lagers and make them shoulder the long sticks with which they drive their bullock-carts and ploughs , which of course at a distance would resemble bayonets .

		These villagers I stationed in two parties behind two hills , so that the ' bayonets ' alone could be seen by the enemy .

		... The enemy were deceived and rapidly retired , and I saved the village from an unmerciful ransacking , to the joy of all the poor people . ''

		In an assault on
Ciudad Rodrigo	ORGANIZATION	, young
Smith	PERSON	, who was of dark complexion and slight build , was mistaken for a Frenchman by a fellow-soldier , a '' big , thundering grenadier , '' who seized him by the throat like a kitten and would have ended his career then and there had not poor
Harry	PERSON	found breath enough to gasp out a vigorous Anglo-Saxon oath , which saved his life .

		A bit of romance relieves the horrors of the slaughter at
Badajos	LOCATION	.

		A young girl of noble blood ,
Juana Maria	LOCATION	de los
Dolores de Leon	PERSON	, fled with an elder sister to the En - glish camp , seeking refuge from the lawless soldiery .

		Young
Smith	PERSON	was fired with love at the sight of beauty in distress ; he took the girl under his protection , won her heart , and ere long married her .

		The union was crowned with happiness , though unblessed with off -
spring	DATE	.

		In recalling this first meeting with the lovely
Juana	PERSON	, her soldier-husband waxes dithy - rambic , and his passion runs away with his syn - tax -- to the infinite credit of his honest heart .

		Of the taking of
Washington	LOCATION	by the British , in
1814	DATE	, we read : '' Suffice it to say we licked the Yankees and took all their guns , with a loss of upwards of 300 men ... and we entered
Washington	LOCATION	for the barbarous purpose of destroying the city .

		Admiral
Cockburn	PERSON	would have burnt the whole , but
Ross	PERSON	would only consent to the burning of the public buildings .

		I had no objection to burn arsenals , dockyards , frigates building , stores , bar - racks , etc. , but we were horrified at the order to burn the elegant
Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and the President 's house .

		... I shall never forget the destructive maj - esty of the flames as the torches were applied to beds , - curtains , etc. .

		Our sailors were artists at the work . ''


Harry Smith	PERSON	's famous ride , on the outbreak of the Kaffir war of
1835	DATE	, from
Cape Town	LOCATION	to
Graham	PERSON	's Town , -- 700 miles in six days , over a rough and roadless country , -- is still remem - bered .

		Eleven years later his brilliant charge against the Sikhs , at the battle of Aliwal , brought him his baronetcy and the grand cross of the Bath , and led to his appointment as governor of
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		His removal thence by Lord
Grey	PERSON	for alleged inefficiency in sup - pressing Kaffir hostilities was attended with circumstances most trying to a man of spirit ; but he met the bitterness of recall with a magnanimity worthy of all praise .

		His old master in war , the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	, openly defended him in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, and the people stood by him .

		Returning to
London	LOCATION	, he met the colonial secretary with a fine resolve not to pose as a man with a grievance .

		In our estimate of his character as revealed in his Autobiography , we can well believe , with his kinsman and editor , that his faults were those of a generous nature unwilling to suspect evil in others .

		His impetuosity , his warmth of language under provocation , his disregard of the value of money , and his touch of bravado , only endear him the more to the reader .

		His horror of the cruelties of war finds frequent expression . ''

		Civilized man , '' he says , '' when let loosiB and the bonds of morality relaxed , is a far greater beast than the savage , more refined in his cruelty , more fiend-like in every act '' ; and again , almost in
Sherman	LOCATION	's well-known words , '' The seat of war is hell upon earth . ''

		But there is some - thing smile-provoking in the following refer - ence to British losses at Aliwal : '' Human life once extinct is in this world gone , and how gratifying it is under Divine Providence to feel that not a soldier under my command was wantonly , unnecessarily , or unscientifically sacrificed to his country ! ''


Walter Bagehot	PERSON	's complaint that so few good books are written because '' an author 's life is a vacuum , '' finds no support in Sir
Harry Smith	PERSON	's stirring chronicle .

		A mass of military detail , often tiresome to a civilian , it certainly contains , but of padding and book - making no remotest reminder .

		The parts re - lating to
South Africa	LOCATION	are perhaps most per - tinent to the times , and will call forth reflections concerning British colonial policy , from which we here refrain .

		27a Student ,
College	ORGANIZATION	, and Character .

		* The college student is a perennially inter - esting individual .

		His microcosm , in which he disports himself according to time-honored traditions and privileges , oiBfers an entertaining spectacle alike from the auditorium and from the stage .

		There is a recognizable sameness about it all , as there is about many of the things of life that grow out of the inherent human traits pertaining to any of the seven ages of man .

		College generations pass rather quickly , and the alumnus of a dozen years ' standing , on revisiting his alma mater , feels that the student of to-day is of a generation that knew not
Joseph	PERSON	and is equally innocent of many other of the things that for him re - main the permanent possession of his college life .

		If the alumnus becomes a professor , or for any other reason remains in touch with the evolving conditions of college affairs , he ob - tains a wider and more intimate view of things , and sees useful growth with gains and losses , wider opportunities , and possibly less enthu - siasm or stimulus in their pursuit .

		For the pro- fessional student of students , and for the en - couragingly large portion of the public that takes a real and helpful interest in the problems which professional educators have to meet , as well as for the student himself , it is natural and proper that a literature should be offered set - ting forth the wisdom of experience , the advo - cacy of reform , the goal of endeavor , the de - sirability of newer and truer ideals .

		In the group of volumes that form a chance acquaintance upon the reviewer 's table we find the genial and realistic reflections of the
Dean of Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, the somewhat paternal counsel of a former college president , the professional contribution of a student of education , the practical conclusions of a physician who is at once guide , philosopher , and friend , and the thoughtful appeal of one who combines with technical training in science the zeal of a social reformer and the inspirational forcefulness of a high-minded idealist .

		It may well be that • Student Life and Customs .

		these various contributions , in spite of their differences of motive and design , reflect a common interest in the trends of present-day education , and so meet on common ground .

		They have at all events a sufficient community of content and import to warrant a composite notice .

		The most objective of the volumes is that of Professor
Sheldon	PERSON	, whose work forms one of the well known series of books on educational topics edited by Mr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	.

		Here the student is presented and described as to genus and species and habitat and manner of life .

		From his appearance in the universities of medieval
Europe	LOCATION	, through the further differ - entiation of those institutions in fulfilment of various national characters and fortunes , to his transplantation on American soil , first as de - pendent on home traditions , and then as a member of more independent foundations , the origin of the American college student is traced and the varieties of his likeness and unlikeness to his European cousins set forth .

		In the main , the American student is the hero of the play , and remains on the stage through all but the earlier chapters .

		All of his char - acteristic institutions are described , -- his class system , his debating societies , his fraternities , his athletics , his social , literary , religious , and other organizations .

		He is , indeed , a member of a complicated body politic , and has his trials and tribulations , his conflicts with authority , and his occasions for the display of valor and proficiency .

		Strange to say , coeducation is almost entirely ignored .

		This kind of infor - mation in regard to the college student has not been conveniently available before , and it is fortunate that it has now been made so .

		Yet the story is by no means a mere narra - tive .

		It contains instructive incidents , some amusing , others rather discouraging , yet in the main helpful and significant .

		The stu - dent can not be successfully dealt with with - out understanding his nature ; and a knowledge of what he has been in former days and what his interests are today is indispens - able to a right direction of his wholesome impulses and the successful encounter with his more alarming frailties .

		Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's judicial review of the facts of the case may prevent theorizing on false basis , and may prove serviceable to the student of educational tendencies .

		Dean
Briggs	PERSON	has collected a few of the at - tractive essays which he has lately contributed to the pages of the '' Atlantic Monthly '' and 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, to other periodicals in a volume well entitled , '' School , College , and Character . ''

		The tone of the volume is as thoroughly sound as it is agreeable and sincere .

		The author takes us into his confidence and reveals the sidelights of a Dean 's professional experiences .

		He mod - estly tells us that his book is '' not a full or - chestra , but a harp with two strings , which the harper twangs as long as the audience will put up with him . ''

		Yet he produces far more pleasing effects with simple means than the more ambitious but less skilful performer on a more complicated instrument .

		The tunes that he plays have some life to them , and , it is hoped , will not pass in at one ear and out at the other .

		Educators are apt to make too much of the technique of their profession , with a conse - quent wearying shop-talk when they come together .

		It is the vitalizing touch of a man who observes with keen vision and a deeply human interest that sparkles in Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	's pages . ''

		Fathers ,
Mothers	ORGANIZATION	, and Freshmen '' will be equally benefitted by reading the whole volume and not alone the essay devoted to them more particularly . ''

		College Honor '' offers a fertile theme , and its irrational vaga - ries are well portrayed .

		The whole volume suggests the growing attention which is being given to the moral purpose of education , and therein lies the specific value of what Dean
Briggs	PERSON	has to say .

		Mr.
Canfield	PERSON	, now
Librarian of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, writes the first volume of a '' Per - sonal Problem Series '' which the publishers introduce with the purpose of doing for pres - ent-day needs what the unreadable books of counsel of many decades ago presumably ac - complished for their own more serious and less distracted generation .

		This is a most delicate task .

		That young people need both advice and influence no one will deny ; and he who finds within himself the call to that function enlists his energies in a righteous cause .

		Yet there is a large amount of ineffective preach - ing done , and publishers do not clamor for sermons wherewith to add attraction to their '' announcements . ''

		There is doubtless a con - siderable body of young men and women who might profit by the things that Mr.
Canfield	PERSON	has set down for their benefit ; and if they chance to read his pages , which is about as likely as that the persons who need the sermon will be part of the congregation , his efforts will not be in vain .

		And yet , without dispar - aging unduly a worthy effort , it must be con - fessed that no great expectations can be aroused by this type of advice and exhortation .

		Many young men and young women will resent this form of counsel , as assuming on their part an ignorance and immaturity which may occur , but is hardly typical ; others will resent the persistency of the guidance which is offered , and turn , as they would in life , to some more attractive form of encouragement that leads and does not drive .

		Mr.
Canfield	PERSON	's book im - .

		presses one as the work of a capable student who has set himself a task for which his temper - ament is not suited .

		One is tempted to recall the comment of a rustic sage upon the address of a successful politician .

		He admitted the excellence of the address , and that the man was a good speaker ; yet he added that a bet - ter speaker would have given that speech differ - ently , and a really great speaker would not have made the speech at all .

		Dr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's book is the second volume of the same series , and has a similar purpose .

		The author is favorably known for his contri - butions to the psychology and physiology of childhood , and has been particularly fortunate in the composition and the leading motifs of what he has chosen to say .

		He seems to come easily and naturally by the gift of pertinent counsel , and rarely commits the fault of over - doing good advice .

		His self-restraint and reserve in keeping a tempting subject from overflowing its natural boundaries adds to the judicious poise of his several chapters .

		Dr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	gives his readers some sujBficiently definite and equally elastic principles for the guidance of the intellectual life , and the vic - tory over self without which true success is conspicuously defective .

		He preaches well and to the point , and is likely to hold his hearers .

		He has no system to defend , no me - chanical routine that leads to success , but well - expressed principles based on well-established foundations .

		If one reflects upon the vast amount of foolish schemes for securing the good things of life that are scattered broad - cast over this supposedly enlightened land , and compares the total mass of these with the small output of wholesome and rational attempts to formulate , for those who need it and can profit by it , some of the essential rules for setting the compass of life and keeping the craft in sea - worthy condition , one is naturally disposed to exaggerate the value of a book like this .

		It is a readable , capable , and timely essay , with a theme vital to all who are not too old or too depraved to improve .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book is more profound ,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 276 more thoughtful , and more ambitious than any of the others .

		It is likewise more difficult to reproduce in spirit or content .

		Its main value lies in its sincere and inspiring idealism .

		How - ever closely we may sympathize or however widely differ from the views which the author sets forth , the sympathy with his zeal , his unusual insight , his enthusiasm for an ideal democracy of opportunity , and with his able expression of his ideals , will always remain to right-minded readers .

		It is in many ways a notable book .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	protests against many of the things that we do in the name of education , and bemoans the neglect of many of the things that we leave undone .

		His stock - taking of the valuable possessions of human - ity , and in particular of the American people , is not likely to encourage the advocates of a triumphant spread-eagle democracy .

		Many of the most serious efforts of mankind are to Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	appalling and systematic wastes of time .

		He does not enthuse over the ability to shout the price of pork from
Chicago	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	, or the making of ten bad pieces of fur - niture in
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	in the same time that it took to make one good piece a hundred years ago .

		We fail to measure aright the good things of life because we fail to apply the right standards .

		Human power , human hap - piness may or may not be advanced by what we are pleased to speak of as improvements .

		And the application of all this to the problems of education is quite direct ; for the purpose of education , when interpreted by these prin - ciples , is nothing less than the guidance of life in all its aspects , the establishment of the social purpose of humanity .

		It would , however , be a pity to mar the profit or the enjoyment of this volume to the prospective reader by attempt - ing to reproduce its message .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	writes as one with a vital message , and with the power to plead his cause powerfully , sin - cerely , effectively .

		It is a good thing , -- it is often an epoch-making thing , -- for a na - tion or an individual to revise its creed of ex - perience , to shake or strengthen its traditional convictions .

		It is no small service to be able to effect this or to set the ferment in motion .

		For many minds this is just what Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son 's volume may accomplish .

		We are all more or less in the woods , and fail to see the forest for the trees .

		A helpful shout from a kindly fellow-traveller may restore confidence in the way we have chosen , or lead us to consider a change of route before it is too late .


Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	.

		Education and Politics .

		* It must be confessed that the title of Presi - dent
Hadley	PERSON	's collection of essays is a most appropriate one .

		It would be difficult to find a title which would more satisfactorily char - acterize the volume , made up as it is of dis - cussions relating to economics , politics , ethics , political education , higher education , and school education .

		These essays furnish many examples of Mr.
Hadley	PERSON	's ability to present strong thought in a clear and forcible manner .

		The first paper , on `` The Demands of the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' furnishes the means for comparing the opportunity which lies before the American citizen of to-day with that which confronted the Puritans .

		The point of com - parison is an apt one .

		Shall the next gener - ation do its work in the spirit of the adven - turer , or in the spirit of the Puritan ?

		Perhaps no one else has shown more clearly the situa - tion as it exists to-day in reference to the standards of political morality , as compared with those of personal morality and commer - cial morality .

		The low standards of political morality are represented as due to defect in public judgment rather than to weakness in individual character .

		In other words , we are ignorant of the particular virtues , the exer - cise of which will secure the proper develop - ment of organized society .

		The time should come , and doubtless will come , when a country like ours will attain that conception of public attitude which is inspired by a sense of moral obligation rather than one bound by legality alone .

		Mr.
Hadley	PERSON	's discussion of the power of public sentiment is particularly discriminating .

		It is not necessarily true that there is a public sentimient in favor of a particular thing be - cause a large number , even a majority of the people , are ready to vote for it .

		Opinions which a man maintains at the cost of another do not count largely in forming the general sentiment of the community , or in producing an effective public movement .

		They repre - sent selfishness rather than public spirit .

		The true public spirit is one which `` will subordi - nate personal convenience to collective honor . ''

		We must agree with Mr.
Hadley	PERSON	in his suggestion that there should be a more fully developed course of political education in our schools and colleges .

April 16	DATE	, he suggests , is not simply a study of facts about civil government , nor is it a training in those scientific principles which regulate the activity of governments .

		`` It is not so much a devel - opment of certain kinds of knowledge as a development of certain essential qualities of character and habits of action . ''

		The charac - terization of subjects for such a course of study is one which we must unquestionably accept .

		It is subjects of an unprofessional character , things that are permanent and affairs that are large , which should serve as the basis of study , while a large part of the political edu - cation comes from the association of students .

		Mr.
Hadley	PERSON	puts forward a strong word against that tendency in modern education which seeks to introduce specialism and pro- fessional studies at too early a date .

		He con - tends that higher education makes people bet - ter workers , better members of a body politic , and better men morally and spiritually ; and in his discussion of this subject he shows clearly the difference between college training and technical training .

		In conclusion , it may be said that a distinct service has been rendered general education by the publication of these papers , inasmuch as they represent a thoroughly sound educational point of view , at the same time a point of view from which , in many quarters , there has been great divergence in the last few years .

Abbott	PERSON	makes a somewhat un - usual division of his work , treating each of the three periods , -- monarchical , republican , and imperial , -- first from the historical and then from the descriptive point of view .

		For the student who really wishes to go into the subject deeply .

Abbott	PERSON	has done an admirable service in his constant marginal references to sources , his select bibliographies for the various chapters , and at the close of many chapters his analyzed lists of passages in various ancient authors re - ferring to the subjects treated in these chap - ters .

		Of course all this is not much to the average student , but the growing tendency to keep in mind the best rather than the average , in such matters , can - not be too highly commended .

		Mr.
Greenidge	PERSON	's book is not so well ar - ranged nor so clearly written as that of Pro- fessor
Abbott	LOCATION	.

		It of course gives information on many points not taken up at all by the other , as has already been indicated .

		It may be ques - tioned whether a '' handbook '' should concern itself so extensively as this does with what may , might , must , could , would , or should have been , or not have been .

		These doubtful forms of statement strike the eye so constantly that one feels for the moment almost like wondering whether anything at all really was , or was not , in the affairs of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Certainly one can not lay the book down with the impression that the student of history as yet faces any great dearth of unsolved problems as subjects for theses and dissertations .

		These long - standing uncertainties , however , are not hope - less .

		Researches in the Greek papyri , for in - stance , have very recently thrown light upon points in Roman law which were heretofore in question .

		THE DIAL 277 The two writers are agreed in attributing the breakdown of the republican constitution to the weight of '' empire . '' ''

		The general machinery of government had broken down , '' says Profes - sor Abbott , '' under the strain put upon it by the policy of imperialism . ''

		Mr.
Greenidge	PERSON	, after calling attention to the inconsistent and unsystematic nature of the earlier constitution , adds : '' But as the knots which the jurists could not untie were cut by the sword , and the constitution reverted to a type far simpler even than that of its origin , we must assume a weakness in the mixed system , which might not have rendered it inadequate as the government of a city state , or even of
Italy	LOCATION	, but certainly rendered it incapable of imperial rule .

		The test was a severe one , and the constitution which could not answer the strain need not be wholly condemned .

		For empire is a mere excrescence on the life of a state , a test neither of its goodness nor of its vitality . ''

		There are many other details of these books which might be noticed , but we shall close with a single one , and that is the imperfection of the indices , -- not serious , perhaps , as indices go , but it is certainly time that indices should go a different gait .

		position to see most of what was best in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , as a practicing architect and a prolific painter he had the technical knowledge which en - abled him to judge of what he saw , and he knew how to write about it in prose so charming that -- all possible deductions to his discredit being granted --
Vasari	PERSON	's `` Lives '' will always rank among the classics of the art student .

		But it was his disad - vantage to have lived in an age which had little his - toric sense , and which also preceded the invention of the camera .

		In our time , history has developed into a science based on researches among archives , the evidence of documents , the sifting and com - paring of testimony , and on explorations of various kinds .

		It may take several generations still to ex - purgate
Vasari	PERSON	's narratives of their contradictions , misapprehensions , and guess-work ; in the mean - time , photography comes to the aid of the pen to furnish accurate and delightful reproductions , in black-and-white , of the great masterpieces in color or form .

		Thus , with new materials coming to hand and fresh means of illustration , the history of Ital - ian art , though often told , may be regarded as still In the making , and there is justification for the many new books which seek to throw side-lights upon it , either as a whole or in parts .

		Of such books , one of the most interesting is Mr.
Edward C Strutt	PERSON	's volume devoted to Fra
Filippo Lippi	PERSON	, in which he attempts a refutal of the '' legend - ary prejudices handed down to us by twelve gener - ations of superficial or biassed critics '' -- preju - dices voiced epigrammatically in
Browning	PERSON	's dramatic monologue by the friar himself : '' Zooks , sir , flesh and blood , That 's all I 'm made of ! ''

		While admitting many of the Carmelite 's frailties , Mr.
Strutt	PERSON	finds them only superficial compared with the depth and tenacity of his artistic nature .

		He finds him more , infinitely more , than mere `` flesh and blood , '' attaining at times a degree of perfection absolutely incompatible with his sup - posed baseness of soul , and to a grandeur of con - ception and a technical skill which reveal him as the connecting link between
Masaccio	ORGANIZATION	and
Raphael	PERSON	, and , indeed , the truest herald of the Renaissance .

		Both as man and artist , Fra Lippi gains much at the hands of his new biographer .

		It is shown that he was almost certainly a personal pupil of Masac - cio 's , and not simply a student of his works in the
Brancacci Chapel	LOCATION	, as implied by
Vasari	PERSON	; that he never '' threw off the clerical habit , '' but left the cloister of the
Carmine	PERSON	with the prior 's consent and permission , continuing to wear the habit of the order all his life , and remaining in cordial relations of friendship with his former brethren ; that his motives for leaving were not only the hopes of ac - quiring wealth and greatness by the practice of his art , but also to support his poverty-stricken rela - tives , who otherwise must have starved .

		Naturally , it was not long before the '' glad monk '' came under the spell of the great move - ment of his age -- the Renaissance , -- which was 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, in turn strongly influenced by him .

		The decisive turning-point in his life , however , was when he left
Florence	LOCATION	for
Prato	LOCATION	.

		Here for thirteen years he worked , completing that series of frescoes in the Dnomo which constitutes not only the greatest achievement of his own career , but the most re - markable artistic event since the completion of
Masaccio	ORGANIZATION	's frescoes of the
Brancacci Chapel	ORGANIZATION	in
Florence	LOCATION	.

		It must not be inferred that Mr.
Strutt	PERSON	's biog - raphy is of the '' whitewash '' order now too prev - alent .

		He grants that there were germs of sensu - ality and human passion in the young monk 's breast , which , in the corrupt atmosphere of the Medicean court , blossomed forth and flourished until the poisonous weed almost stifled the beautiful flower of his better nature .

		But throughout all he finds a gradual and uninterrupted evolution of the artist toward a perfection which made him a powerful and abiding influence in the art of the Quattrocento .

		The Prato frescoes furnished suggestions for
Bot	ORGANIZATION	- ticelli 's dancing nymphs and swaying angels ; the tondo
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, now in the
Pitti Palace	ORGANIZATION	, intro - duced a new interpretation of the old theme , which later reached its highest manifestation in
Raphael	LOCATION	's Madonna of the Chair ; the background of the same picture was the direct precursor of figures in the historical paintings of Ghirlandajo and
Raphael	PERSON	.

		Three highly interesting personalities -- Rem - brandt ,
Mantegna	PERSON	,
Giotto	PERSON	-- form the subjects of the latest three volumes of the series of '' Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture . ''

		Presenting respectively the greatest painter of the Dutch school , the chief of the Paduan , and the most epoch - making of the Florentine , they are an interesting group .

		The Rembrandt volume is a condensation by Mr.
Malcolm Bell	PERSON	of his own earlier work ; and the task he has set himself is very like the one undertaken by Mr.
Strutt	PERSON	for Lippi , -- to give a truer and more kindly picture of one who has been misjudged sorely .

		But it is less entertaining as well as less convincing in style .

		The matter is divided into three parts -- Rembrandt the Man , Rembrandt the Painter , and Rembrandt the Etcher .

		The illustrations are numerous , and the genealogical and chronological tables as complete as is possible with our uncertain knowledge .

		The biographer of
Mantegna	LOCATION	,
Miss Maude Crutt	PERSON	- well , has few accepted notions to dislodge , and no follies and frailties to condone .


Mantegna	PERSON	was one who took life seriously , ardently , with no doubts of its worth nor of the value of his own labors therein .

		Straining every nerve toward the new ideals of life and thought which were to bring a fresh youth back to the world , he was among those who give significance to
Morelli	PERSON	's term for this period -- '' the epoch of character . ''

		Some interesting pages of the opening chapter are devoted to a description of the Paduan school founded by Squarcione -- archaeological rather than artistic , as compared with the contemporary school at
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Very iconoclastic indeed is Mr.
F. Mason	PERSON	Per - kins in his volume on Giotto .

		He places
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	's birth some ten years earlier than
Vasari	PERSON	's date , and makes him the son of a well-to-do landed pro- prietor instead of a poverty-stricken day-laborer ; ignores the story of
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	's accidental discovery of the lad ; sees evidence that so far as he may have had any real teaching beyond that of Nature herself , it came through the works of
Giovanni Pisano	ORGANIZATION	; maintains that we may to a certain extent trace for ourselves the stages of his extraordinary development as an artist through the frescoes and paintings still remaining to us , ruined and repainted as in the majority of cases they are .

		But even more revolutionary than the chapters relating to
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	himself are the two introductory chapters dealing with his forerunners and the influences which prepared the way for him .

		We have been accustomed to hear the now famous pulpit of the
Baptistery	LOCATION	at
Pisa	LOCATION	-- the earliest known work of
Niccolo Pisano	ORGANIZATION	-- cited almost invariably as the first important product of what has been termed the '' Modern Age '' of Italian art .

		Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	regards
Niccolo	PERSON	far more as one gifted with un - usual powers of appreciative selection than as a really extraordinary innovator .

		That mysterious personage ,
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	, to whom the entire credit of the sudden revival of the pictorial arts in
Tuscany	LOCATION	has been long given , loses several of his laurels ; in fact , he may be considered as a type represen - tative of that artistic progress and advance which we know to have taken place in Florentine art dur - ing the latter part of the thirteenth century , rather than as any strictly defined personality .

		As a whole , this twentieth volume of the '' Great Masters '' series is truly a model for a work of this class , -- a combination of a biographical sketch and critical guide-book based on independent and schol - arly investigation .

		Of quite a different type from the foregoing books is the volume of '' Stories of the Tuscan Artists , '' since it is not a critical work , and makes no pretension to original research .

		It is , however , a pleasant gathering together -- chiefly for the sake of young people or of beginners in art-study -- of tales relating either to the artists or to the subjects of their works .

		The illustrations -LRB- fifty-three in number -RRB- , on which so much of the value of a work of this kind depends , are particularly well-chosen and admirably reproduced in photogravure and half - tone ; moreover , the writer has a vivid and pic - turesque style , which holds the attention and makes the volume extremely readable .

		But it is not pos - sible to rate highly a book so full of errors of the most patent and inexcusable nature .

		In art mat - ters these are legion , and may easily mislead the amateur ; but even a child in the infant class of a
Sunday	DATE	school will know better than to accept the statement on page 119 , ''
Trajan	PERSON	, who was emperor of
Rome	LOCATION	at the time of the birth of Christ , '' etc. .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 These '' Stories '' begin with the sculptors of the school of
Pisa	LOCATION	and conclude with
Botticelli	PERSON	as the most representative artist of the classical revival .

		Being so good for their purpose in naany ways , it is a pity that a little kindly oversight should not have made this book a great deal better .

		Closely connected with the art-life of
Italy	LOCATION	is the monastery of
San Marco	LOCATION	.

		Not only two great artists -- Fra Angelico and
Fra Bartolommeo	LOCATION	-- in succession dwelt within its cloisters , but nearly all of the Quattrocento artists fell more or less under the influence of its great preacher ,
Savonarola	LOCATION	.

		Naturally , the larger part of Mr.
G. S. Godkin	PERSON	's attractive book on '' The Monastery of
San Marco	LOCATION	'' is concerned with the brilliant but tragic story of
Savonarola	LOCATION	; but the illustrations are half-tones from
Fra Angelico	ORGANIZATION	's frescoes , and some of the most interesting pages are in the concluding chapter , ^ ' After Savonarola . ''

		No traveller can be so phlegmatic as to stand within the walls of
San Marco	LOCATION	without a swelling heart ; it is alive with innumerable memories , its cloisters and cells and library are eloquent of its glorious past .

		The late repentant Florentines have built within its walls a tomb to the prophet whom their fathers stoned ; and in the
Piazza Signoria	LOCATION	, where '' the martyr 's soul went out in fire , '' was uncovered in
May	DATE	last a large bronze disc with a medallion bust of the great Frate , and an inscription recording the man - ner of his death '' by an iniquitous sentence . ''

		The whole story is so well told in this book , that it will serve as the next best thing to an actual visit to the spot whither the thoughtful tourist is almost certain to turn his first steps after arrival in
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Only one section of Professor
James M. Hop	PERSON	- pin 's book on '' Great Epochs in Art History '' is devoted to Italian art , but it is the first and much the longest one -LRB- a hundred and twenty-five pages -RRB- , and is called '' Italian Religious Painting . ''

		Start - ing at the very beginning of painting , as found in the sacred places and houses of the first Christians of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, the essay gives principal place to
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	,
Signorelli	PERSON	, the Sienese school ,
Benozzo	LOCATION	,
Gozzoli	PERSON	,
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	, and
Raphael	PERSON	.

		The story ends where
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's work begins , although his name is introduced as `` the last and greatest , '' and his '' Creation of Man '' in the
Sistine Chapel	LOCATION	is called '' a sublimer reach of the imagination than all that had gone before which was called art . ''

		`` And yet , '' adds the author , `` the older Italian artists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , in their simple nature and childlike faith , dwelt nearer the springs of divine inspiration in religious paint - ing than
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, and better exemplified the profound words of Protagoras , ' The true test of Art is its seeming absence . ' ''

		An interesting feature of this little sketch is the place given to the small towns as art-centres .


Assisi	LOCATION	,
Orvieto	LOCATION	,
San Gemignano	LOCATION	,
Prato	LOCATION	,
Pistoja	LOCATION	, and
Arezzo	LOCATION	are shown to have had quite as much as
Florence	LOCATION	to do with the development of Tuscan art ; the evolution pro- ceeded from mind to mind in unseen coils resem - bling the development of new forms in nature , but the centres of art were changing continually .

		In general , this essay will be found a safe guide ; but it was not the '' Divided Annunciation '' that in - spired
Browning	PERSON	's poem of '' Fra Lippo Lippi '' -LRB- as stated on page 67 -RRB- , but '' The Coronation of the Virgin . ''

		Moreover , to call this volume '' Some Great Epochs in Art History '' would be surely a more appropriate title than its present one .

		The reader 's sense of order is offended to find this first essay followed by one on
Scopas	PERSON	, who lived four hundred years before
Christ	LOCATION	; and close upon its heels come '' French Gothic Architecture '' and `` English Pre-Raphaelites . ''

		Excellent as each of these is in itself , they are too unrelated in time and character to admit a grouping under a title which implies some continuity , or at least some trans - cendent importance such as they hardly possess in art-history .

		Inseparably connected with the study and enjoy - ment of art is a knowledge of symbolism .

		To trace the original significance of the symbols now inter - woven with each Saint represented in art , to go back to the primal cause of the choice of some spe - cial patron by this or that section of the community , is to gain fresh light both on the meaning of any artist 's work and also on the equally interesting evo - lution of popular belief .

		Good work has already been done by such students as Helmsdoerfer ,
Von Radowitz	PERSON	,
Parker	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	; but in the field of symbolism , as elsewhere , there has been need for the modern process of scientific sifting .

		This has now been done most engagingly by Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	, in her book of '' Lives and Legends of the Evangelists , Apostles , and Other Early Saints . ''

		Here we have embodied recent discoveries , new facts of undoubted authenticity in the received biographies of many Saints ; and even the compara - tively uncertain field of legend is not without some illumination on several persistent yet hitherto inex - plicable traditions .

		Both the text and the illustra - tions serve to mark the different stages of art de - velopment , the religious life of the various periods at which they were produced .

		Consequently , typi - cal works are presented from masters as diverse as
Fra Angelico	ORGANIZATION	,
Luini	PERSON	,
Sodoma	LOCATION	,
Memlinc	LOCATION	,
Madox Brown	PERSON	, and
Holman	PERSON	Hunt .

		Without disparagement to the foregoing books , it may still be said that the most important of all on our list is the last .

		New histories of art are less needed than books to tell us the reasons why we enjoy , or should enjoy , works of art when we see them .

		This is what Professor
L. J. Freeman	PERSON	's work on '' Italian Sculpture of the Renaissance '' undertakes to do .

		Although the subject is treated chronologically , beginning with the
Pisani	PERSON	and end - ing with
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, it is addressed chiefly to the aesthetic sense .

		The author acknowledges that the scientist may classify Greek marbles as dispas - sionately as he would beetles , and gain in both in - stances the same intellectual pleasure .

		But this is the secondary value of art , the primary value being 280 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
April 16	DATE	, to use the data of observation imaginatively , to find in it the same suggestions for fancy that one finds in music , in natural objects , in the spoken word .

		These primary values vary in type continually , from the symbols of the mediaeval carvers to the highly expressive sculpture of the sixteenth century .

		But the author 's fullest strength is shown in his most difficult task -- the analysis of reasons for our satisfaction or dissatisfaction in the works of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	.

		Speaking of that great but early work , the ''
David	PERSON	, '' he says : `` The real reason , I think , for the lapses of enjoyment ■ which are sure to occur during one 's contemplation of the
David	PERSON	is found in the fact that the young sculptor has chosen , as an older sculptor would not have chosen , to represent the most awkward state in the development of the human body , and every defect of development is emphasized by colossal size .

		So that , although the thing is so well done that it com - municates the sensations of physical energy directly and with a rush , it is not , after all , a form that can steadily invigorate , for it is the arrest in stone of a transition in growth , '' Between the completion of the ''
David	PERSON	'' and the beginning of the plans for the tombs of the Medici in
San Lorenzo	LOCATION	, which are the exponents of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's second manner in sculpture , sixteen years had elapsed , -- years of disappointment , disillusion , and , most insupportable of all , diversion of artistic energy into expression by means of painting .

		The kind of enjoyment gained from the artist in the work of these later years is not the kind given by sculpture ordinarily ; and the observer who stands before the nudes of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	neither as an artist nor as an anatomist is in a position analogous to one who listens to a play in a foreign language .

		The author 's psychological explanation of the state of mind they induce is interesting , but we have space for only a brief quotation . ''

		The temperament feels what it brings the power to feel .

		Whatever the environment has been , if one is akin to
Michael Angelo	PERSON	in temperament , he will feel before these figures the exaltation and incorporation of forces whose workings he has felt or is destined to feel , and he therefore obtains a great aesthetic pleasure .

		As it happens , the generations since
Michael Angelo	PERSON	have shared in that temperament so gener - ally that he has expressed them to themselves , and in so doing afforded to the modern consciousness the relief of defining itself in art . ''

		Yet as any mode of artistic expression , however deep and wide it be , will always be inadequate to human experience , there will always be a minority who feel its scope , but whom it does not express .

		Therefore there are temperaments who feel
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's powerful communication of vitality , but can not so enjoyably translate it into intimate emotion . ''

		A work so individual and important as this can - not be represented justly by quotations ; but after reading it one feels that the following words of the Introduction are hardly extravagant : `` Unless the architect who studies
Brunelleschi	ORGANIZATION	's dome feels the unique beauty of its wonderful curve , unless the archaeologist who dates a Greek vase is in some degree teased out of thought by its loveliness of form , unless the poet , to whom
Botticelli 's Spring	ORGANIZATION	is a Lucretian allegory of the seasons , sees and feels the pattern of line intertwining with line , he is as blind to primary values as were the Roman peasants who made a quarry of the Forum , and burned an - tique marbles to procure the lime for their wretched huts .

		An amusing '' ^ ^ Introduction to English Liter - text-bookon ature , '' by Mr.
Maurice Francis Engiuh	PERSON	literature , ggan , is published by Messrs.
Mar	PERSON	- lier
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, evidently for the use of parochial schools .

		It is curious that a man of the author 's parts should have been willing to present so distorted a view of the history of our literature , or to have made his theological bias so very evident .

		His idea seems to have been that every Catholic writer , no matter how insignificant , must be exalted .

		This leads to such results as four pages about
Southwell	PERSON	in a chapter which can spare but a single page for Mar - lowe , to a whole chapter of twenty pages devoted to Pope , while
Milton	PERSON	has to be contented with five , , to the setting of Moore '' in the first rank of lyrical poets , '' and to other like vagaries .

		But the real quality of this astonishing manual must be set forth by actual quotations .

		It is a little startling to be told that Milton '' advocated polygamy , '' and that ''
Keats	PERSON	does not inspire or ennoble . ''

		When we read that ''
Shelley	PERSON	is enthusiastically admired by all who love poetry for the qualities that make it 80 entirely different from prose , '' we are much im - pressed by the profundity of the thought .

		It is also interesting to learn of Shelley that he '' was born a poet of a very high order ; he made himself a bad man . ''

		There is a finality about this pro- nouncement that leaves nothing further to be said .

		The late
Aubrey de Vere	ORGANIZATION	, we are told , wrote '' the most mighty drama since Shakespeare or
Dryden	PERSON	. ''

		^ We have the greatest respect for Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	's memory , as we trust our readers have also , but it may be well to jog the memory by saying that '' Alexander the Great '' is the name of this '' mighty drama . ''

		Of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	we read that '' one of the saddest things in modern literature is the sight of this poet with a divine gift dissolving his pearls in acid for swine to drink . ''

		One inimitable para : - graph must be quoted in full .

		``
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's poems have great merit , but he was first of all a prose writer .

		His '
Thyrsis	PERSON	' has been much praised .

		He lacked Faith , and consequently Hope .

		The same may be said of

		It was not to be expected , of course , that
Professor Carpenter	ORGANIZATION	would say much that was new on the subject , especially within the limits of a hundred and fifty pages .

		The book is notable , however , -- like some others in the series , -- as being the work not of a contemporary nor of a too ardent worshipper , but of a critic who could handle his subject quite objectively .

		His aim has been to present the main facts of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's life
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 '' `` with snch comments as are now appropriate -- the com - ments natural to men who have heen born since
Longfellow	PERSON	's best work was done , and who , though they honour him not less than did his contemporaries , must of necessity judge him , and the little world in which he moved , from a different point of ■ view . ''

		The picture of the poet 's life in
Brunswick	LOCATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, though necessarily but an outline , is sympathetic and , we believe , true .

		In his criticism of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's writings Professor Carpenter agrees in the main with his leading predecessors .

		He points out that we have outgrown the didacticism which the readers of sixty years ago found so inspiring ; but dwells on the high distinction achieved by Long - fellow in securing a permanent hold upon `` the heart and intelligence of the people at large , of nineteen-twentieths of the race . ''

		He pays some at - tention to the foreign sources from which the poet drew his models and sometimes his ways of think - ing -- a subject which has never yet received ade - < iuate treatment .

		Altogether the author has suc - ceeded remarkably well in preserving a good pro- portion and in producing an interesting narrative .

		For the frontispiece a reproduction of Samuel Law - rence 's crayon portrait of
1854	DATE	has been wisely chosen : the one which best , to quote Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, '' l -RRB- reserve8 that alert , inspired expression which came into his face when he was affected by any strong emotion . ''

		It is significant that this portrait was made in the year in which
Longfellow	ORGANIZATION	freed himself from the drudgery of college teaching and began to realize his dream of a life devoted wholly to letters .

		.

		It is with something of surprise that 1SS4 .

		th `` reader learns the contents of Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	's volume on '' The French People , '' in the series of '' Great Peoples '' issued by
Messrs. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is really not a history of the French people as such , but a history of
France	LOCATION	as viewed through its political events , and of the leadership of rulers and statesmen who have too often been inclined to fol - low their own will without consulting that of the people .

		Therefore , the one who seeks information as to how the nation lived through adversities and bore itself in peace and struggle , its resources , its prosperity , and its economic misery , seeks here in vain .

		Only occasionally is there a hint about what the people really thought and felt .

		A history of the French people which should picture it to us as the English people has been pictured , is something for which we may wait long .

		Meanwhile we are to be content with this really attractive volume , which , although repeating what has already been told so often , does it with a certain terseness of style and poignancy of phrase that make the old theme sound somewhat new .

		Mr.
Hassall	PERSON	has usually the knack of making the subject he treats yield fresh interest and instruction .

		In this case some of the freshness of interest is due to the writer 's very English attitude in judging French political life of the past and present .

		The book seems to have been written with the main idea of demonstrating that
France	LOCATION	has never known how to inaugurate local or parliamentary government or foster popular freedom , but has been rescued from recurring anarchy only by a strong and generally arbitrary government . ''

		The temper of the French people as seen in its government '' might well have been the title of the book .

		And Mr.
Hassall	PERSON	must be said to have been right in his estimate .

		But with all her fondness for a strong , even a military , government ,
France	LOCATION	has nevertheless , even in her periods of absolute rule , given suggestions of freedom of a far subtler kind : the freedom of literary discussion , of artistic perfection , of philo - sophic inquiry , of amiable intercourse and good manners , -- freedom depending upon maturity of mind and vivacity of temperament , such as
Europe	LOCATION	nowhere else evolved in so typical a fashion .

		The author has given some instances of this , but by no means enough of them .

		It is not quite fair to make political forms alone the basis from which to judge a nation 's strength or influence .

		We think , however , that with the scope of inquiry which the author has set himself , the book will be found well worth reading , and may easily replace others on our shelves in which the same things are said less aptly .

		So much controversy followed the o ^ nsZf ^ '' '' ' purchase of
Florida	LOCATION	and its occupa - tion by the
United States	LOCATION	, largely because of discussion of General
Jackson	PERSON	's bold actions , that when some questioned the worth of the acquisition , stating that it was a land of swamps and forests , others replied , in facetious strain , that it was certainly productive -- of docu - ments .

		The latest contest with
Spain	LOCATION	in the same part of the world seems to be followed by similar evidence of productiveness ; and , because of the bitter discussions and dissensions in army and navy circles , it may be a long time before anyone can tell in impartial and unprejudiced language the true story of the Spanish - American War .

		Certainly Secretary
Alger	PERSON	could not be expected to do this , and his book at once takes its place in the list of controversial writings .

		It is not really an attempt to give the history of an international contest , as its title , '' The Spanish-American War '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , would indicate ; but the purpose behind it was '' to place on record some of the prominent facts con - nected with the organization , equipment , and move - ments of the army , together with the administra - tion of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	, with the hope that such statement will serve a useful purpose as an example , should another crisis of the same kind occur . ''

		The war itself was marked by many surprises , where good fortune seemed to follow American movements at every turn .

		The resources of the country were scarcely touched before the fighting was over ; and so the strain of the conflict being speedily ended , there was abundant opportunity for discussion and fault-finding .

		There was no prepar - 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, A doetor ^ s wordto / tvUdom .

		ation for war , and that the results were so gener - ally favorable was no more surprising than was the comparatively quick organization and equipment of an army of a quarter of a million men , when there was in the country not a bit of khaki cloth for uniforms nor manufactory familiar with its produc - tion , and not duck cloth enough to make tents for the men .

		The chapters in Secretary
Alger	PERSON	's book which tell of campaigns in which he did not par - ticipate will not be regarded of so much importance as those which tell of the campaigns in the Quar - termaster 's department in which he was vitally interested .

		And in all likelihood the judgment of the future historian will be that difficulties were met about as well as could have been expected considering the generation of peace after the Civil War .

		Without attempting to discuss '' the quiddity of ens , '' Dr.
Norman Bridge	PERSON	attacks , with acumen and good sense , some more or less abstruse questions in his little book , `` The Rewards of Taste '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , which also treats of '' Some Tangents of the Ego , '' '' The Mind for a Remedy , '' '' The Etiology of Lying , '' * ' Man as an Air-Eating Animal , '' '' The Psychol - ogy of the Corset , '' '' The Physical Basis of Ex - pertness , '' and '' The Discordant Children . ''

		The essay chosen for the title-rdle is not the best of the series ; it fails to strike the keynote of the volume .

		The writer has the experienced physician 's obser - vant eye , and he knows how to present his observa - tions in an attractive form .

		Indeed , he betrays something of that genius which consists in impart - ing fresh interest and wonder to the commonplace .

		His discussion of abnormalities of temperament , and their proper treatment , is especially good .

		Among `` tangents of the ego , '' self-conceit , in its varied forms , claims a foremost place . ''

		Who ever knew a conceited man to be conscious of his con - ceit ! ''

		exclaims the author , almost in despair of a cure ; and he elsewhere cites the bishop who pro- tested that he was not conceited , but simply con - scious of his own superiority .

		Truly , the reader will say to himself , he who reduces all his egoistic tangents to the normal curve is better than he that taketh a city .

		To Dr. Bridge the mental state of a patient is vastly more significant than the physical .

		In his chapter on `` The Mind for a Remedy , '' he takes an attitude toward the pseudo-scientific modes of healing that is surprisingly tolerant in a doctor of '' the old school . ''

		He admits the efficacy , in certain cases , of `` some novelty or humbug , or a belief in the power of something beyond himself on which the patient leans or believes he leans . '' ''

		The Etiology of Lying '' attracts by its very title .

		But it makes perfect truthfulness appear so hopelessly unattainable as almost to constitute a defense of falsehood , despite the wise closing words of the essay . ''

		Man as an Air-Eating Animal '' arouses curiosity -- and satisfies it .

		In short , there is hardly a chapter that will not engage the interest of even the most languid reader .

		In a substantial volume of four hun - fotSr aX .

		dred and sixty pages entitled '' Shake - speare 's Plots '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
H. Fleming	PERSON	discusses
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's constructive skill as an artist .

		All but the two introductory chapters are devoted to particular plays , -- '' Mac - beth , '' `` Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, '' `` Twelfth Night , '' `` Othello . ''

		The story of each play is given at length in a running interpretation with comment on the technique of the plot .

		On the whole , Mr.
Fleming	PERSON	has done a work well worth doing , and has done it well ; but he starts out with a false assumption rather mechanically conceived .

		It does not follow that because '' the curve is the line of beauty , '' '' a drama is written , not in the form of a triangle , but in that of an arch . ''

		A graphic representation of any drama , showing the rise and
fall	DATE	, as in the semicircle he employs , would deviate so much from the curve as to destroy wholly any feeling of conformity to the `` line of beauty . ''

		By the very nature of the effect it is to produce , a drama must not be a series of gradual changes ^ passing imperceptibly from one into the other .

		Mr.
Fleming	PERSON	's style is simple to baldness , and far too often admits such sentences as , '' Still another function which Viola fulfils is , she is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Type of the Normal . ''

		The analyses of the plots might very profitably have been brought within narrower limits , and the diff useness of treatment is made the more obvious and irritating by such ex - pressions as , '' a technique that is simply perfect , '' '' as fine work as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ever did , '' employed without any attempt to indicate what makes the technique perfect or the work fine .

		The exclama - tory method of imparting literary information is certainly no longer in vogue , and it never was es - pecially illuminating .

		It is but fair to add that the volume contains a great deal of genuinely useful matter .

		It is the product of much careful , pains - taking work , and it is presented clearly and directly , if not attractively .

		The reader can hardly fail to get from it a better notion of the organic unity of a great drama , a surer insight into the literary architectonics of the world 's greatest artist .

		Lamarek and the Lamarckian Revival .

		The rise in this country and in
France	LOCATION	of a Neo-Lamarckian school of organic evolutionists has awak - ened interest in the life and work of its founder .

		A man of genius who lived in advance of his age , unappreciated , neglected , and forgotten , comes to his own after the lapse of a century .

		His views on evolution have now taken rank as recognized rivals of the natural selection theory of
Darwin	LOCATION	, and not only win much support in some quarters but stir up opposition in others .

		Professor
Alpheus S. Packard	PERSON	, in his volume on ''
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	, his Life and Work '' -LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has ren - dered material aid to this discussion by his sympa - thetic treatment of the life of this naturalist , the able presentation of his scientific achievements , and the detailed rendition of his views on questions

		J THE DIAL 283 which have risen to prominence in the literature of recent years .

		The hook is the outcome of a personal investigation of
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	's surroundings , his family history , his life at
Paris	LOCATION	, and his connection with the reorganization of the Jardin des Plantes and the establishment of the great
Paris Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	after the French Revolution .

		Lamarck was eminent not only as a botanist but preeminently as a zoologist .

		He did some credit - able work in geology , meteorology , and physical science , and became the father of invertebrate paleontology .

		Professor Packard has traced in his writings the steps in the growth of the theory which took final form in his Philosophic Zoolo - gique .

		He also summarizes his views on the evolu - tion of man , on morals , and on the relation of science and religion .

		The distinctions between Darwinism and Lamarckism , and the relations of the former to the modern school which claims kin - ship , are clearly stated .

		A full bibliography of
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	's writings is appended .

		Ten years ago , that lack constituted a real griev - ance , but so many excellent manuals have appeared during the past decade that the difficulty is now simply one of selection .

		Mr.
A. G. Newcomer	PERSON	's '' American Literature '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a recent addition to the list , and seems to us quite as good as any of its competitors .

		It remains a readable book , without sacrificing to diffuseness and the essay style the essential qualities of concise and accurate statement that must characterize a good working text .

		Its judgments are sober and well - considered , not diverging very far from what the writer calls '' current estimates . ''

		The appendix of bibliographical notes and chronological tables is very useful , as is also the section of '' Suggestions for Reading and Study . ''

		In the matter of illus - trative extracts the author , while not eschewing them altogether , is economical of his space , and finds room only for what is peculiarly typical or suggestive .

		--
Miss H. L. Mason	PERSON	's '' American Lit - erature : A Laboratory Method '' -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	: The Author -RRB- is a text of wholly different type .

		It is not a book to be read at all , but rather a set of syllabi and exercises , based upon a working list of reference books .

		There are about twenty of these syllabi , each having a definite subject -LRB- such as '' Criticism of Society , '' '' Nature Studies , '' '' The International Novel , '' and the like -RRB- .

		Each syllabus outlines a course of reading , and tests the thorough - ness with which it has been pursued by an ingenious series of suggestive and rather searching questions .

		There is no doubt of the value of this method of study , although we believe it should always be coupled with the use of a consecutive historical text .

		When suitable library facilities are to be had , we can commend the present volume as an important adjunct in the work of teaching .

		/ Mr. iiinnis
Richmond	LOCATION	which in real - ity contains a rambling discourse , with a strong moralizing flavor , about the very many things one is likely to say concerning children , if one sets out to talk rather aimlessly yet coherently of these interesting bits of humanity .

		There is naturally much to be said concerning the relation of parents to children , and the responsibility of modern edu - cational systems for children 's failings .

		There is the usual note of warning that in our zeal for child-study we may omit the best part of childhood .

		But all this has been said before , to the weariness of listeners at educational meetings ; and there is no need of reducing to cold , enduring print what may have properly served for the passing interest of an active discussion .

		No amount of such writ - ing will have the slightest influence upon matters pertaining to the study of children .

		The most praise - worthy fact about the book is that the author does not tell us that it was printed at the urgent solici - tation of friends ; for in most books of this type that ominous sentence meets the eye on the first page .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A charming little book , just published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and printed at the
Merrymount Press	ORGANIZATION	, is called '' Right Reading , '' and is further de - scribed as containing '' words of good counsel on the choice and use of books selected from the writings of ten famous authors . ''

		The counsellors in the case are Helps ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Disraeli	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, Rus - kin ,
J. C. Hare	PERSON	, Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric
Harrison	PERSON	.

		Some of these chapters are familiar enough , but others are not known half as generally as they should be .

		We are particularly glad to find the pungent passage from
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's '' Parerga and Paralipomena , '' as translated by Mr.
T. Bailey Saunders	PERSON	.

		Several excellent text-books for the study of civil government in the
United States	LOCATION	have been produced of late years , but all of them -- with the exception of Professor
Hinsdale	PERSON	's '' The American Government '' -- have been unsatisfactory for the simple reason that they did not contain enough matter for the needs of the student .

		This complaint can not be made of * ' The Federal State '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Roscoe Lewis Ashley	PERSON	, which is a volume of six hundred pages , discuss - ing every aspect of the subject that a teacher could wish , and is both attractive in presentation and logical in arrangement .

		Every educator knows the superior value of a book in which the student may delve , over a book which he is expected to learn outright , and Mr.
Ashley	PERSON	's manual has this good quality , besides illus - trating all the other good qualities of its competitors .

		It seems to us to be exactly the book that has long been needed , and we strongly recommend it for use in the higher grades of secondary school work .

		A memorial volume containing many tributes to the late
Lewis G. Janes	PERSON	is published by the
James H. West Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Books of this sort are apt to be somewhat perfunctory , but it is impossible to read the present 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, volume without beiug impressed by the heartfelt sin - cerity of what is said , and by the almost complete absence of the perfunctory element .

		The tributes are from many hands and hearts , from the associates of Dr.
Janes	PERSON	in the work of the
Brooklyn Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the
Greenacre Summer School	ORGANIZATION	, the Anti- Imperialist League , and the other good causes which he did so much to further .

		His friends will prize the volume , and to those who did not know him it will be interesting in its revelation of the intellectual effort , noble character , and simple goodness of its subject .

		Volume IV .

		of the '' Publications of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	Historical Society , '' edited by Secretary
Franklin L. Riley	PERSON	, comes to us from
Oxford	LOCATION	,
Miss.	LOCATION	.

		It is a stout volume of five hundred pages , including much valuable matter .

		The Rev.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's documentary contribution on '' The Real
Philip Nolan	PERSON	'' is the feature of greatest general interest ; but the student of history will find his account in many other of the papers offered , for example , in Mr.
J. W. Garner	PERSON	's study of '' The First Struggle over Secession , '' or Mr.
A. H. Stone	PERSON	's examination of the state Constitution and Statutes in their relation to the freedmen .

		The volume has its literary interest , too , in the form of Prof.
Dabney Lipscomb	PERSON	's study of the writings of
T. A. S. Adams	PERSON	.

		An interesting book has been made out of the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' by collecting the series of personal sketches of recent American writers that have been prepared for that paper by various hands .

		Mr.
Francis Whiting Halsey	PERSON	has edited the volume , which is called `` Authors of Our Day in their Homes . ''

		The number of authors included is twenty-two , and the illustrations are either portraits or photographs of library interiors .

		This work is published by
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has also made a volume , this time of his own writings contributed to various periodicals , which he calls '' Our Literary Deluge and Some of Its Deeper Waters , '' and which is published by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		That veteran Grecian , Professor
Alexander Kerr	PERSON	, of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, has just published , through
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, an edition of the '' Bacehse '' of Euripides , text and translation .

		The Greek and the English face each other upon the pages , and the latter is given us in stately and harmonious verse that it is a distinct pleasure to read .

		Professor
Kerr	PERSON	is also en - gaged upon a translation of Plato 's '' Republic , '' in pamphlet parts , containing one book each .

		The notes are few but well selected , and take their place at the foot of the page .

		Two parts have thus far been issued by the publishers ,
Messrs. Charles H. Kerr & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a real boon to students to have the '' Republic '' made accessible in English in this inexpensive form .

		`` Behind the Grill , '' by Mr.
Duncan Francis Young	PERSON	, is a little book published by the
Abbey Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It tells in the form of brief chapters , many of which are single anecdotes , of the tribulations of the cashier of a small country bank .

		Written without any pretensions to lit - erary style , these reminiscences are pointed and inter - esting , revealing as they do so much of the petty mean - ness in human nature , and recounting so many of the devices by which careless or dishonest persons contrive to make life a burden for the bank cashier .

		Readers who do not know very much of the business of banking will find this an instructive little book , as well as an amusing one .

		The work is prepared by Messrs.

		The book is exactly what it pretends to be , a volume of lecture-notes for use in pedagogical teaching , and it is now printed that students in pedagogical courses may use it as a sort of syllabus in their work .

		The volume offers suggestions for practical exercises of many kinds , and , in the hands of a teacher who knows how to use such material , ought to prove an exceedingly useful adjunct to his instruction .

		Dr.
Thomas Dunn English	PERSON	, who died on the first of the month , had nearly completed his eighty-third year , having been born in
1819	DATE	.

		Although a fairly prolific literary worker , his fame may be said to have suffered rather than benefitted by the wide popularity of a single song .

		He was so generally known as the author of '' Ben Bolt '' that in the public mind his name came to be associated with that song alone , just as the name of
John Howard Payne	PERSON	is associated with '' Home , Sweet Home , '' regardless of '' Brutus '' and all the other '' works . ''

		Among the books of Dr. English , the following list is fairly representative , although far from complete .

		It comprises '' American Ballads , '' the `` Boy 's Book of Battle Lyrics , '' `` Select Poems , '' '' Fairy Stories and Wonder Tales , '' ''
Jacob Schuyler	PERSON	's Millions , '' and ''
Ambrose Fecit	PERSON	. ''

		There are also sev - eral plays to the credit of this writer .

		Most of the work here mentioned dates from his later years , but we get some idea of his relations with an earlier period when we remember that '' Ben Bolt '' was written in
1842	DATE	, and that
Poe	PERSON	, in '' The Literati , '' paid him his compliments .

		Dr. English 's son-in-law , the Rev.
Arthur Howard Noll	PERSON	, will probably collect the literary remains of this worthy man of letters .

		BRIEFER MENTION 324 NOTES 324 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 325 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 325 THJS RHODE S BE NEFACTION .

		Not long ago , we were speaking of the agencies at work in our modern world whereby the cause of '' international amity '' was being advanced , and a year or so earlier , we made a few remarks concerning the form of '' prescient philanthropy '' which is wise enough to direct its efforts toward the future rather than con - fine them to the amelioration of present-day conditions .

		Had the noble gift of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	to the English-speaking world then been fore - seen or realized , it would have provided a striking illustration for either of the two heads of our discourse .

		No better idea for the fur - thering of friendship between the nations could well be conceived than this plan to bring to - gether for educational purposes the picked youth of the two hemispheres , and no form of benefaction to the human race has ever exhib - ited more of that foresight which is the better part of all philanthropic endeavor .

		Briefly stated , as we understand it , the Khodes bequest provides that about a hundred young men from the
United States	LOCATION	, and per - haps fifty more from the British colonies and from
Germany	LOCATION	, shall each be given a three years ' scholarship at the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and that others shall succeed them , upon like conditions , in perpetuity .

		The stipend offered is fifteen hundred dollars annually for each scholar , a generous provision , and ample for the purposes of a student at any of the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	colleges to which men repair with the intention of doing serious work .

		The delegation from the
United States	LOCATION	is to be made up of two students from each state and territory , thus being representative of every part of the coun - try .

		The conditions of the selection , more - over , are of such a nature as to insure the sending of a finely-equipped body of youths to the ancient city on the
Isis	ORGANIZATION	.


Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	was too much a man of the world to suppose that attainments of the strictly academic sort are all that are essential to the making of a man , and his bequest wisely provides that not schol - astic tests alone shall be applied in the selec - tion of his beneficiaries , but that these shall be supplemented by tests of character , and 804 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, even of physical endowment , to an extent that , on the whole , subordinates the intellect to the sum total of the other qualities of manhood .

		The written examination is well as far as it goes , but it should not be made a fetich , and the testimonial of character , if it comes from an unimpeachable source , affords a better basis of choice .

		This may be thought to be begging the question , in view of the common and notorious abuse of testimonials , and the problem no doubt presents grave difficulties on this account , but we shall not we willing to call them insurmount - able until the plan has been given a fair trial .

		When the central administrative machinery of the trust shall have been set up , when all the necessary general officers and committees shall have been appointed , and when it comes to the actual selection of two Rhodes scholars from each of the states of this
Union	ORGANIZATION	, -- then , no doubt , the real crux of the problem will present itself .

		By what means shall the two young men be chosen , say , in the
State of Illi	ORGANIZATION	- nois ?

		How shall the claims of the competi - tors be coordinated to insure that real merit , and not influence or favoritism , shall determine the selection ?

		That the competition will be keen is quite certain ; these scholarships will be the great prizes of the educational world , partly because of the generous individual pro- vision made for them , and partly because of the marked distinction which their award will confer .

		When the intellectual tests have been applied , and the applicants have been reduced to a manageable number , the final decision will call for the most delicate weighing of claims , and the most absolute impartiality .

		It can not properly be made by perfunctory meth - ods , it will have to be made by men who will take the task seriously , who can bring to it unusual powers of judgment and discrimina - tion , who are not to be imposed upon by the various forms of pretence and humbug that will clamor for their hearing and seek to con - trol their verdict .

		In this delicate matter of adjudication there are two extremes , both of which must be care - fully avoided .

		Too much weight must not be given to the opinion of any one person , nor must too much weight be given to merely nu - merical suffrages .

		Neither an arbitrary dictum nor a meaningless plebiscite must be the con - trolling element in the decision .

		To put the matter less abstractly , there is the danger , on the one hand , of deferring too much to the opinion of the executive head of some institu - tion of learning , and , on the other , of being unduly moved by an avalanche of certificates attesting the worth of some person who com - bines the instinct of the politician with that of the student .

		The executive head of a school or college usually knows less about the indi - vidual student than the instructor who has daily relations with him , and a recommendation from that source , not being made at first hand , is peculiarly liable to errors of judgment .

		In the case of the candidate in whose behalf many voices are raised , the quality of the suffrages is vastly more important than the quantity , and a keen insight into the motives which actuate ordinary human nature will recognize the majority of such recommendations as ab - solutely worthless .

		The opinions of politicians , journalists , clergymen , and '' leading citizens '' generally , are subject to large discounts , and should , in many cases , count rather against a candidate than in his favor .

		In short , the task of selection is one for which civil ser - vice commissions and examining boards of the ordinary type will not be likely to prove adequate ; it is a problem which will demand the devising of a more delicate form of ma - chinery than has hitherto been applied to such purposes .

		Educational opinion in this country has al - ready received a certain amount of expression on the subject of the
Rhodes	LOCATION	bequest , although there has not been time for a careful consid - eration of the conditions .

		The administrative difficulties of the project have been generally pointed out , but its larger aspects do not seem to have received adequate recognition .

		Most of the men who have thus far been persuaded into print belong to the class of what may be called our educational moguls ; in other words , the presidents of our larger universities have been interviewed by an enterprising press , and have placed their more or less valuable views upon record .

		But strictly speaking , this matter is one that does not concern the American university at all , except as it concerns the gen - eral interests of education .

		The Rhodes scholars are not to be sent by the universities , but by the high schools and academies .

		Hitherto , the American student who has gone to a European university has , almost without exception , gone there for advanced work , after having been graduated from some college in this country .

		But the intention of the
Rhodes	PERSON	foundation is to offer an opportunity for undergraduate work to a lot of bright American boys from eighteen to twenty years of age .

		In spite of the obvious
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 inference from the terms of the bequest , our educational spokesmen have thus far very gen - erally taken for granted that the Rhodes scholars would be drawn from the ranks of our uni - versity students .

		This unwarrantable assump - tion must be disposed of before it is possible to take an intelligent view of the subject .


Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	clearly intended that the young Ameri - cans sent to Oxford by his bequest should be of the same general age and class as the young Englishmen who go up to the university from the great public schools .

		Now the ana - logue of such a man in the
United States	LOCATION	is found , not in the student who has com - pleted , or even begun , his college course , but in the student who has just completed the work of some good high school or preparatory academy .

		It would be premature to make specific sug - gestions concerning the administration of this great trust until its terms are more fully known and more carefully studied .

		As far as its American administration is concerned , it seems that there must be a committee of some sort for the entire country , and probably a local committee for each of the States and
Terri	ORGANIZATION	- tories .

		Assuming this to be the general plan , we should say that one conclusion of much importance follows from the considerations ad - duced in the foregoing paragraph .

		This con - clusion is the simple one that college and university interests should not have the pre - dominant voice in the administrative organiza - tion .

		University ofiicers should by no means be ignored in the constitution of the commit - tees , for the counsel of such men as Presidents Eliot ,
Gilman	PERSON	, and
Jordan	PERSON	, Professors
Norton	PERSON	,
Sumner	PERSON	, and
Gildersleeve	PERSON	, is too valuable to be missed ; but the men who stand officially for the larger educational systems of States and cities , together with the men who stand for the secondary educational interest most directly affected by the Rhodes endow - ment , should prove the main reliance for its efficient administration .

		This consideration seems to us of vital importance , and may pro- perly be urged even at this early stage of the enterprise .

		There is a homely old saying about looking a gift-horse in the mouth , and another less homely one about viewing with suspicion the gifts of the Greeks .

		Both have been illus - trated by the published comments on the
Rhodes	LOCATION	bequest already made on this side of the water .

		One such comment goes so far as to propose `` that some concerted action on thjB part of those interested in American educa - tion should be taken , and taken immediately , to prevent the acceptance of the Rhodes schol - arships . ''

		The provincial spirit which asks what we have '' to do with abroad , '' and which '' views with alarm '' the possible contamina - tion of our youth by the '' effete civilization '' of
Europe	LOCATION	, is usually nothing more than amus - ing , but when it goes to such lengths as this it becomes vicious .

		That this rabid form of Anglophobia should be voiced by '' lewd fel - lows of the baser sort '' was inevitable , but that it should come from the mouths of educated men has surprised us not a little .

		As if the sending of thirty or forty boys to
England	LOCATION	every year for their college education could possibly be a menace to American ideals !

		As if English society had not also its lessons for our own national life !

		As if it were not the best thing in the world for a few of our young men to learn by an intimate personal experi - ence that Englishmen and Americans are essen - tially of the same race and have developed upon essentially similar lines !

		It is a narrow prejudice indeed that would not welcome the opportunity of keeping a thousand of our young men , let alone a hundred , at school in
England	LOCATION	, to the broadening of our outlook and the strengthening of the tie that should ever bind us to the people who speak our parent language , with all that this implies in the way of common institutions and ideals .

		We wish only that some American philanthropist might feel his imagination fired by the magnificent idea of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, and might provide the means whereby a hundred picked English youths from
Harrow	LOCATION	and
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and Rugby should always be enrolled among the students of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		We should then have the conditions for an interclange of sympa - thy and mutual respect that could not fail to be felt in both the great branches of our race .

		But we may well be thankful for what is already assured in this direction , while hoping for still further developments along the same general line of reciprocal helpfulness .

		In democracy is the hope of the world , and only
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	thus far among the nations have approached an understanding of the whole meaning of democracy .

		In both countries the advance of democracy has had its setbacks , and tolerated many irrational accidents , but in both has substantial progress been made toward what is in effect the same goal .

		We are convinced that the Rhodes foundation will contribute toward the realiza - 806 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, tion of this fact , although we shrewdly suspect that the founder himself had quite other ideas upon the subject , -- that he has , in short , builded better than he knew , as is often the case with the masterful persons who set the feet of men in new and untried paths .

		AN EARLIER APOSTLE OF
AMERICAN CULTURE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Oar typical ' * freshwater '' college of to-day , with its dozen fairly specialized scholarly instructors and a few thousand books , is modest enough , and yet it usually gives a most misleading and exaggerated idea as to the same institution a century ago or more .

		In
1757	DATE	,
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	hesitated to become president of
Princeton	LOCATION	, feeling '' hardly competent to instruct the senior class in all studies . ''

		Two professors and two tutors made a tolerable faculty then .

		Hebrew , Greek , and Latin mostly patristic , logic , mathematics , -- these were the staples .

		Modern languages , science , history , have since run the gauntlet into the curriculum , and En - glish literature is just coming painfully to its proper heritage .

		But , worst of all , every American col - lege in
1800	DATE	was but an ill-conducted school , where boys must merely recite the lessons conned from text-books .

		The
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library seemed respect - able to
George Ticknor	PERSON	in boyhood , but when he returned from
Gottingen	LOCATION	he found it was but '' a closetful of books . ''

		Of the larger university ether he and
Everett	PERSON	brought us the first whiff .

		Ticknor himself , son of a well-to-do ex-teacher and tradesman of
Boston	LOCATION	, was admitted to
Dart	PERSON	- mouth College at ten , after oral tests at home in
Cicero	LOCATION	and New Testament Greek .

		Graduating at sixteen , after but two years actual residence , with a tincture of
Horace	PERSON	and astronomy in his memory , he acquired in the next three years , from an English - born clergyman of
Boston	LOCATION	, some real acquaintance with such recondite authors as Homer ,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and Euripides ,
Livy	PERSON	, and
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Madame de Stael 's ''
Germany	LOCATION	'' told him of university life there .

		With much effort , he secured a German dictionary from another state , borrowed a German grammar written in French , and discovered in the suburban village of
Jamaica	LOCATION	Plain an Alsatian who could give him a very faulty pronunciation .

		Such were the conditions at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and in
Boston	LOCATION	, a decade after the deaths of
Friedrich Yon Schil	PERSON	- ler and
Christian Gottlob Heyne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mastery of Hot - tentot with the clicks , or the native speech of
Samoa	LOCATION	, could be more hopefully sought in
Boston	LOCATION	now .

		Ticknor sailed for
Europe	LOCATION	in
April , 1815	DATE	.

		Four years later he returned , with the richest intellectual results of study and travel and with a private library already large and costly .

		For many years he struggled , in vain , to have
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	re - modelled on something like its present lines .

		Only his friend
Everett	PERSON	, the brilliant young Greek pro- fessor , shared
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's German scholarship and progressive ideas ; and he , after four years , was sent to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ticknor only , as the first
Smith	PERSON	professor of modern languages -LRB- 1820-1835 -RRB- , had a real departmental staff of instructors , -- a native German , an Italian , and a Frenchman .

		Of his own nominal stipend of a thousand dollars a year , he long drew only six hundred on account of the extreme poverty of the college .

		Mr.
Ticknor	PERSON	's town house and library was for a half - century , even during his own long visits abroad , the scholarly centre of
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- from which city
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has never been separable -RRB- , perhaps also its strongest literary bulwark .

		Among his friends and correspondents he counted the greatest foreign scholars , like Humboldt , and
King John of Saxony	ORGANIZATION	, the learned student of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ticknor himself was not a source of direct inspiration as a great teacher , orator , or creative writer ; but all such men valued his influence .

		He was a wide-ranging and accurate student , all his life .

		His '' History of Spanish Literature '' -LRB- 1849 -RRB- is still the exhaustive and authoritative work on the subject , though any - thing but a readable or stimulating book for laymen .

		His life of Prescott gives us a pleasant acquaintance with the biographer as well , though both , of course , maintain their punctilious dignity and
Boston	LOCATION	man - ners .

		That
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's tendencies , save in pure scholar - ship and educational reform , were conservative , aristocratic , exclusive , is not strange .

		He and his class were held closely bound by their material in - terests and social creed .

		The fast-growing wealth of
Boston	LOCATION	was heavily invested in the mills on the
Merrimac	LOCATION	.

		The South , rather than the West , then furnished the chief market .

		Even men who de - plored the existence of slavery -- as nearly all men then did -- might cling to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and to the constitutional recognition of slaveholding as a bar - gain fairly entered into and irrevocable .

		So , when the most promising of young
Boston	LOCATION	aristocrats , like
Phillips	PERSON	and Sumner , became Abolitionists , or even Free Soil revolters from the dominant Whig party ,
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's door was slammed in their faces , and nearly all '' the four hundred , '' of course , imi - tated the example .

		-LRB-
Prescott	PERSON	is said to have been the only exception . -RRB-

		When , from the time of
Tiberius Gracchus to Henry George	ORGANIZATION	, has vested wealth wel - comed revolutionary doctrines , or petted their ex - pounders ?

		Far more bitterly did the older '' ortho - dox '' Unitarianism denounce the radical free religionist ,
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, as '' an atheist in the pulpit , '' a fit ally for incendiary traitors like
Garri	PERSON	- son .

		Professor
Wendell	PERSON	is quite right in arguing that all this was not merely excusable or rational , but really inevitable .

		Though '' Humanity sweeps onward , '' the cautious conservative has his peculiar virtues and uses .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 It is important to remember that
Emerson	PERSON	, and the younger creative writers generally , were openly following , though with feet less heavily shod , in the same paths with
Garrison	PERSON	and
Parker	PERSON	.

		Channing himself did not live long enough to grow the hard shell of real conservatism .

		On the other hand , such men as
Felton	PERSON	, the great Greek professor , a life-long intimate friend of Sumner , denounced his radical politics far more hotly than
Ticknor	PERSON	, and finally even broke off personal relations .

		Ticknor acted from calm life-long principle .

		That his own creed , political , social , and religious , was absolutely right , he knew as surely as
Winthrop	ORGANIZATION	or Mather .

		His naive letter on this subject is printed in
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	's life of Sumner , Vol .

		III .

		In truth , not merely the conservatism of property generally , but the very spirit of scholarship itself , is often at war with the creative imagination .

		The scholar lives , by his own choice , in the past ; the poet rather in his ideal -- even if unattainable -- iuture .

		So the scholar craves permanence , while the freer vision of the dreamer bids him hope , if not fight , for radically better conditions of life .

		These two powers are oftener not united , in large measure , in the same person .

		Encyclopaedic learn - ing weighs down the winged soul too heavily .

		Books abused , says
Emerson	PERSON	, are among the worst ■ of things . ''

		Meek young men in libraries `` forget , he adds , that they to whom they make submission - were themselves but bolder and more self-centred youths .


W. D. Whitney	PERSON	, or
Justin Winsor	PERSON	, could have made a crushing retort , by describing the chronic inaccuracy of dreamers .

		Certainly
Emer	PERSON	- son himself was quite unfit for sustained investi - gation and scholarly accuracy , though he could admire , in more tolerant moods , even the • bookworm .

		Lowell , it is true , did combine tireless energy as - a reader , an omnivorous memory , and reflective .

		analytical criticism , with the poet 's imagination .

		Doubtless the critic profited by the partnership ; but the poet often , even in old age , complains bit - terly that arduous study has dried up the creative sources .

		His poetry might have been largely the gainer if he , like
Longfellow	LOCATION	, could have quietly - sought , and enjoyed all his life long , whatever sus - tenance his imagination craved ; or even had he been often secluded for years in villages or fields , with little comradeship save his own wide-ranging - thoughts .

		But poet and scholar , creator and preserver of our literary wealth , have need of each other ; and the truly civilized community itself needs alike the poet and the scholar , the uplift toward better things to strive for , the full consciousness of all the treas - ured experience and thought garnered from the centuries since Homer or the Vedic hymns .

		Ticknor first made liberal scholarship possible in an American college .

		In his later life he lent his costly books , with the utmost generosity , to every ^ serious student .

		He , more than any other man , labored to found the
Free Public Library of Bos	ORGANIZATION	- ton , the oldest , and still the best , among such in - stitutions in
America	LOCATION	.

		To that library he bequeathed his own collection of Spanish books , said to be still the richest in the world , outside of
Spain	LOCATION	itself .

		Ticknor 's name must be written , perhaps larger than any other , among the creators of a wide and deep literary culture , who are surely , in the long run , among the godfathers of later literature as well .

		This truth is demonstrable in his case .

		Emerson or
Thoreau	LOCATION	, though each owes much in detail to older authors , could indeed be essentially himself in his sylvan home .

		But
Longfellow	PERSON	's world-wide humanism and
Prescott	PERSON	's fine literary style were vitally indebted to
George Ticknor	PERSON	, and to the new culture which his name best represents .

		They breathed naturally , all their lives , the air of the << alcoved tomb , '' as Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	calls the library .

		Moreover , culture , being closer to the earth , has a hardy local root which is denied to the imagina - tive faculty .

		The splendid poetic outburst which began with
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	culminated in
Lowell	LOCATION	, -- and , alas , is past .

		Our great poets and romancers are silent .

		The sweet minor singers of this our Lyr - ical Intermezzo may be found in
Indiana	LOCATION	or
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia quite as often as in
New England	LOCATION	.

		But for historical composition in particular , there is still one centre only ; and a short radius , sweeping from the gilded dome of
Boston	LOCATION	's
State House	ORGANIZATION	, through
Quincy	PERSON	,
Jamaica Plain	LOCATION	, and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, would in - clude nearly all the chief names of living or dead .

		To Ticknor , and to
Franklin	PERSON	before him , -- that is , to the collectors of books and founders of libraries , -- this sturdiest and most advanced phase of our national scholarship is primarily due .

		``
William Cranston Lawton	PERSON	.

		It is difficult to realize that
Francis Richard Stockton	PERSON	, who died on the twentieth of
April	DATE	, had completed his sixty-eighth year .

		Irrepressible youth - fulness of spirit characterized his last work -- the pirate romance of `` Kate Bonnet '' -- even more dis - tinctly than some of his earliest writings .

		After a high school education in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the city of his birth ,
Stockton	PERSON	served his apprenticeship to literature by working for the newspapers , and an editorial con - nection with '' Scribner 's Monthly '' and '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	. ''

		Among his books the following may be mentioned : `` The Lady or the Tiger , '' ```` The Late Mrs.
Null	PERSON	, '' '' The Hundredth Man , '' '' Adventures of Captain Horn , '' '' Mrs.

Aleshine	PERSON	, '' '' The Dusantes , '' ''
Ardis Claverden	PERSON	, '' `` The House of Martha , '' `` The Associate Hermits , '' and '' A Bicycle of Cathay . ''

		The list of his books is a long one , and they have provided innocent enter - tainment for a host of readers , both young and old .

		He had a whimsicality of invention which was all his own , yet he had also a power of serious characteriza - tion which assures him a modest niche in our permanent literature .

		308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ^ ^ t It ^ faj g00ks .

		A
Virginia	LOCATION	Gextl.eman of Two Centuries Ago .

		* The writings of Colonel
William Byrd	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, now published in a beautifully - printed volume , consist of three long accounts or journals of life in the colony of
Virginia	LOCATION	in the
early years of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		Of the three manuscripts , `` The Progress to the Mines '' is the most interesting , '' A Journey to Eden '' the most descriptive , and '' The Dividing Line '' the most valuable .

		In the latter work , the nomenclatory line was the boundary between
Virginia	LOCATION	and
North Caro	LOCATION	- lina ; and Colonel
Byrd	PERSON	had the gratification of knowing that his surveying work was accepted by the Crown as final , -- and it still remains so .

		He could state with equal satisfaction that the survey cost the Crown but one thousand pounds ; to one who reads carefully the de - scription of the manner in which the work was done , this sum seems slight indeed .

		Byrd gives a truly dismal account of the famous Dismal Swamp ; saying that '' it con - tained no living creature ; neither Bird nor Beast , Reptile nor Insect came in our view . ''

		The Swamp at that time could scarcely have difiPered much from the Swamp to-day ; and bears , deer , and wild - cats are now hunted there ; snakes abound , and there is also very good fishing .

		The dark-colored water which he so abhorred , and zealously tempered with rum before drinking , was stained with juniper-root ; and to-day it is held in such high esteem for its healthfulness that folk send for it at great distances for medicinal use .

		Throughout Colonel
Byrd	PERSON	's writings are many expressions verging on slang , and many words used in senses which had hitherto seemed to me distinctly modern .

		Thus : '' The In - habitants wanted elbow-room '' ; ''
New York	LOCATION	was a Limb lopt o # E of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' ; '' To make a Slippery People as good as their Word '' ; the use of the word '' lugg , '' meaning to carry ; and the constant use of the word -LRB- and doing of the deed -RRB- to '' tip , '' meaning to give a petty sum for service rendered .

		The pages abound with terse sentiments of a dry humor , such as these : '' They extended to
Jamestown	LOCATION	where like true En - glishmen they built a Church that cost no more than * The Writings of ' * Colonel
William Byrd	PERSON	of West - over in

		It had rained so little for many weeks that the Naides had hardly Water enough left to wash their Faces . ''

		The writer gives a very spirited description of the house of
Colonel Spottswood	PERSON	, showing a luxury hardly to be expected in such a remote plantation in a new colony and new world . ''

		Mrs.
Spotswood	LOCATION	received her old Acquaintance with many a gracious Smile .

		I was carry 'd into a Room elegantly set off with Pier Glasses , the largest of which came soon after to an odd Misfortune .

		Amongst the favorite Animals that cheer 'd this Lady 's Solitude , a. Brace of Tame Deer ran familiarly about the
House	ORGANIZATION	and one of them came to stare at me as a Stranger .

		But unluckily Spying his own Figure in the Glass , he made a
Spring	DATE	over the Tea Table that stood under it , , and shatter 'd the Glass to pieces ; and falling back upon the Tea Table made a terrible Fracas among the

		This Exploit was so sudden and accompany 'd with such a Noise that it surpriz 'd me and perfectly frighten 'd Mrs.
Spotswood	LOCATION	.

		But 't was worth all the Damage to shew the Moderation and good Humour with which she bore this Disaster .

		In the Evening the noble Colo , came home from his Mines , who saluted me very civilly , and Mrs.
Spotswood	LOCATION	's Sister ,
Miss Theky	LOCATION	, who had been to meet him en Cavalier , was so kind too as to bid me welcome .

		We talkt over a Legend of Old Storys , supp 'd about 9 , and then prattled with the Ladys till 't was time for a Travellour to retire . ''

		We may well reprint this posthumous testi - mony to the amiability of a colonial dame who in such a wilderness could meet the destruction of her beautiful pier glass and tea equipage with '' moderation and good humour . ''

		The best pages of these journals are those which tell of the
Virginia	LOCATION	colonel himself ; he enters into very candid personal detail in a man - ner which at once reminds the reader of
Pepys	PERSON	and his diary .

		Byrd had the same fresh - springing and frank interest in '' the Fair Sex '' which was ever displayed by the great English diarist ; but he had also a devoted love for his wife and children .

		His pages have no gross - ness save the inevitable free-and-easy speaking of the life and literature of his day , -- the free speaking of Franklin ; and indeed he equals
Franklin	PERSON	in his art of writing forceful , lucid , and charming English .

		The settlers of Vir - ginia and

William Byrd	PERSON	, which Professor

		The carefully worded epitaph engraved upon
Byrd	PERSON	's tomb presents the best epitome of his life .

		From it we learn of the ample fortune he inherited from a father of the same name , who was a prosperous trader , planter , and politician , and founder of that noble estate , Westover-on - the -
James	PERSON	; we hear of his education in En - gland , and his intimacy there with folk of knowledge , wit , high birth , and public station .

		We learn of his further education in the Low Countries and
France	LOCATION	; and then of his career of success in his native land , where he became Receiver - General , was for thirty - seven years a member of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and finally became its President .

		He was a man of pleasure , as his writings plainly show ; and though the epi - taph pronounces him a `` splendid Economist , '' the records of his life scarcely prove this , -- at least in any sense of the word `` economy '' which we now recognize .

		His intimacy with the
Earl of Orrery	ORGANIZATION	, and his election to the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	, kept him in touch with many things of scholarly interest in
England	LOCATION	.

		He married two wives , whom he dearly loved , and had several children ; one was '' Beautiful
Evelyn Byrd	PERSON	, '' whose name has of late ap - peared in more than one historical tale , -- notably in Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's `` Audrey . ''

		The pages of
William Byrd	PERSON	's Journals show a distinct scholarliness , -- and especially a familiarity with the natural history of all lands .

		They evince , too , a capacity for intelligent comparison , and for drawing of useful and in - teresting deductions from what he saw .

		His observations are stated without pedantry , in a simple mode of assertion which is not only pleasing but convincing .

		Byrd was a skilled botanist , with a great love of flowers and trees ; he made constant study of the curative quali - ties of the wild plants he found , eagerly in - quiring of the Indians , and experimenting on his patient friends , both savage and civilized .

		Like many of his neighbors in
Virginia	LOCATION	, he thus acquired considerable skill in medicine .

		He corresponded with such famous botanists as
Mark Catesby	PERSON	and Sir
Hans Sloane	PERSON	, and his library gives evidence of his love and study of medicine and medicinal plants .

		He had an entire book-case of medical and pathological works , -- pharmacopoeias , dispensatories , herb - als , and botanies , and two hundred or more books on special diseases or special treatments of di - sease .

		He was therefore far better equipped , and probably far more experienced , than the regular practitioners of medicine in the Vir - ginian colony .

		Of what he called '' French Books of En - tertainment , '' Colonel
Byrd	PERSON	had a charming collection , -- one that would to-day be deemed well-chosen and ample .

		Books of travel , his - tory , and romance were plentiful upon his shelves , together with many volumes of divin - ity -LRB- as became a Christian gentleman of the Church of
England	LOCATION	-RRB- , and a wonderfully good collection of '' Classicks . ''

		There were , in all , over four thousand volumes , -- the best edi - tions in the best bindings ; and kept in twenty - three handsome book-cases of carved walnut .

		These books were sold in
1777	DATE	.

		The estate of twenty-six thousand acres which
William Byrd	PERSON	inherited from his father did not long satisfy a man in whose veins burned the land-fever common to all
Virginia	LOCATION	colonists .

		He hungered for the vast tracts of river land which he saw during his survey of the Dividing Line in
1728	DATE	, and he soon ac - quired twenty thousand acres of the '' Land of Eden '' described in his second monograph .

		Mile after mile was added , till at his death he owned over one hundred and seventy thousand acres of the best land in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		He planned to establish colonies on these extensive pos - sessions , -- one a colony of thrifty Swiss set - tlers ; but this scheme was never accomplished .

		The impression made upon us of the author of these journals is that of an intelligent gen - tleman and a kindly friend .

		A sensible man , too , he must have been , never running to extremes , nor credulously accepting every - thing told him ; a pleasant companion of un - varying good temper and cheerfulness , under privations and annoyances which must have been hard for one of his temperament and breeding to bear .

		This tribute of appreciation we give to the journal-keeper ; though the jour - nal itself rather than its writer is of consider - ation to us to-day .

		But we can never , even after two centuries , wholly disassociate an au - thor from his work .

		In outward form this reprint of Colonel
Byrd	PERSON	's writings is a truly elegant volume , of 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, suitable size and perfect paper and typography ; and it is edited in the most satisfying manner .

		The introductory sketch of the
Byrd	PERSON	family , and the ample yet concise notes , are precisely what the student -LRB- and the careless reader as well -RRB- can appreciate .

		It is not to be doubted that the editor , Mr.
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	, found his task a pleasant one , for he has im - pressed his enthusiasm and thoroughness upon his readers .

		A reviewer must hesitate at too lavish praise of a book , especially if the author be living , lest it seem fulsome ; but the interest in this volume as literature , and its value as history , are too absolute to admit of hesitation ; it affords to critic and to reader that unusual treat -- a book without a fault ; and it is pos - sessed of every positive virtue possible to a work of its nature .

		The Jesuits in
Paraguay	LOCATION	.

		* Of the countries which , in the sixteenth century , came into the possession of
Spain	LOCATION	through
Papal Bulls	ORGANIZATION	, through the
Treaty of Tordesillas	ORGANIZATION	, through discoveries , exploration , occupancy or settlement , the vast region sur - rounding the
Rio de la Plata	ORGANIZATION	and its tributaries in
South America	LOCATION	was placed in a somewhat different category from all the others .

		The geological formation of this region was imme - diately seen to give no promise of rich gold - mines as a reward for hardships most certainly to be endured by those who would take pos - session thereof ; and after the search was abandoned for a waterway by which direct communication might be obtained with the west coast of the continent , the Spaniards -- being not yet ready to appreciate the advantages the country offered for cattle and horse-raising -- passed it by .

		There was nothing to attract adventurers save the facilities the country offered for those engaged in the nefarious pur - suit of slave-catching .

		Consequently towns were few and unimportant .

		That part of the country which bore the name of
Paraguay	LOCATION	was , early in the seven - teenth century , an out-lying province of the Spanish Viceroyalty of
Peru	LOCATION	; and communica - tion with
Spain	LOCATION	was about as easy as with the capital of the
Viceroyalty	ORGANIZATION	.

		that province was ill-regulated , and the charac - ter of the Spanish settlers far from admirable .

		Included within the Province was a region of indefinite extent , lying on both sides of the
Tropic of Capricorn	ORGANIZATION	, and bearing then , as it does still , the name of
El Gran Chaco	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Indians of the Chaco region were not like the Incas of
Peru	LOCATION	, but were of the nomadic
Pam	PERSON	- pas tribes , the Guaranis being the most im - portant .

		When , early in the seventeenth century ,
Acquaviva	PERSON	, General of the Society of Jesuits , determined upon a remodeling of the system previously employed by his Order for the civ - ilization and evangelization of the Indians , he selected
Paraguay	LOCATION	as a suitable ground for the trial of his chief experiment .

		Possibly the principal point in its favor was the paucity of Spanish population , which in every other part of the New World had run counter to the plans of the missionaries .

		Leaving only so many missionaries in other parts of the conti - nent as were absolutely necessary , the mem - bers of his Order gathered the Indians from El Gran Chaco into towns or communal vil - lages , called Reductions -LRB- Reducciones -RRB- ^ and taught them the simple arts of civilization and some of the rites and duties of the
Christ	LOCATION	- ian religion .

		Within thirty years this system embraced twenty Reductions , averaging a thousand fam - ilies each .

		Later , there were forty - seven Reduc - tions , in which 300,000 Indian families were being trained to habits of industry and good order ; and the number was even far greater when , in
1767	DATE	, the Jesuit system was replaced by another under which the missions rapidly declined , the villages were abandoned , the churches -LRB- some of them no mean specimens of architecture , we are assured -RRB- were left to de - cay , and the Indians went back to the wild life from which the Jesuits had with great diffi - culty previously won them .

		In the century and a half of the Jesuit occupancy of this over-looked corner of the world , there was accumulated a wealth of his - torical material to which scant justice has hitherto been done .

		The Jesuit Reductions , as an experiment in social economics , have not received the attention they deserve .

		The few writers upon economic subjects who have re - ferred to them at all , have presented such incomplete and contradictory views of the Jes - uits ' system as to destroy their value as illus - trations .

		The annals of that period are filled with heroic names , and episodes of thrilling

		THE DIAL ail interest , which it would be the glory of the historian to rescue from oblivion .

		Mr.
R. B. Cunninghame Graham	PERSON	, whose in - terests in
Paraguay	LOCATION	a quarter of a century ago appear to have been generally other than liter - ary , claims no skill as a historiographer , yet evinces some very important qualities of the historian , in his work entitled '' A Vanished
Arcadia	LOCATION	. ''

		He has an appreciation of the value of historical material ; he is a close observer , and he has a keen sense of humor .

		His style is at times epigrammatic , he is inclined to in - dulge himself in sarcasm , and he finds in re - cent events in
Africa	LOCATION	analogies for events which his researches in Paraguayan affairs reveal .

		With sympathies for the Jesuits and their work awakened by viewing , in the course of his journeys in
Paraguay	LOCATION	, the ruins of the Reductions , he has pursued a thorough investi - gation of the history of the missions in the works of Spanish and French historians , an - nalists , and archivists .

		He finds a justification for the title he has chosen for his narrative of the Jesuit missions , in the happy
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	life which the Reductions inspired during their in - tervals of immunity from the incursions of slave-hunters , rival religious orders , or jealous government officials .

		At such times the happy neophytes were marshalled to their daily tasks by merry peals upon church-bells , and went to the fields in procession to the sound of music and headed by holy images .

		At mid-day they sang hymns , and enjoyed dinner and a siesta before resuming their work ; and at sun-down they returned to their abodes in the village in procession , singing as they had gone forth in the
morning	TIME	.

		In their leisure hours they were regaled with church ceremonies , and an abun - dance of music , dancing , and merry-making .

		It is upon the vanishing of this well-depicted
Arcadia	LOCATION	that the author lays the greatest stress .

		Not only does he narrate the circumstances at - tending the expulsion of the Jesuits from Par - aguay in
1767	DATE	, but he fully discusses , with no little show of indignation , the injustice of the treatment accorded to them .

		The book is a valuable contribution to his - torical literature , and every reader must be grateful to the author for having rescued from oblivion the thrilling episodes he relates .

		It is not without its faults , however .

		Its index could have been more helpful if it had included more than a list of the capitalized proper names found upon each page , or even if it had in - cluded all of those .

		A few errors of dates are excusable after the author 's apology therefor .

		The value of the book as a guide to the flora and fauna of the region of which he treats would have been enhanced if he had given some of the English equivalents of the Paraguayan names he uses so glibly .

		It seems strange that , in spite of all his careful research , he should be unable to explain that the name
Mamelucos	PERSON	was given to the half-breed desperadoes of
Brazil	LOCATION	because of their resemblance to the Egyptian Mamelukes ; and he might have told us that the term '' Reduction '' was applied to the Jesuit missions , because the Indians were therein reduced to order and civilization , -- a picturesque choice of a word for such a use among a people whose minds were much ab - sorbed by the process of reduction by which the precious metal was obtained from the ore .

		* Ever since its foundation in
1805	DATE	, '' for friendship , charity , and mutual assistance , '' the
New England Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York City	LOCATION	-- the first of its kind in
America	LOCATION	-- has been ac - customed to celebrate Forefathers
' Day	DATE	, gen - erally with a banquet followed by toasts and the singing or recitation of original verses .

		Until
1857	DATE	the dinner was preceded by a public oration delivered by a distinguished member of the Society or an honored guest ; and it is these speeches , together with one or two written since for special occasions , that Mr.
Cephas Brainerd	PERSON	, a valued member of the Society , and his daughter have collected and edited .

		The result is two volumes of undoubted interest and significance .

		312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, as individual ODes , are sensible that it is after all only history with her suggestive questions and comparisons that can '' make men wise . ''

		The Puritans , of course , as main theme or point of departure , are the subject of every speech ; and however well the reader may know his history of
New England	LOCATION	's colonization he can hardly fail to get here some new side light upon that heroic period of the nation 's story .

		Among the earlier speakers , the first two of whom entitle their addresses sermons , the emphasis is upon the religious aspect of the Puritan movement , with the moral for the present generation sometimes unpleasantly ob - trusive .

		In the later addresses the dispassion - ate historical tone prevails , and they are cor - respondingly more urbane , if no less pointed , as to present-day issues .

		For example .

		Dr.
Gardiner Spring	PERSON	's famous '' Tribute to
New England	LOCATION	'' -- the sermon for
1820	DATE	and the first that was preserved -- deals with the divine lead - ing behind the Puritan settlement and with the beneficent effect of that settlement on literature , on religious liberty and on the influence and extension of religion , in
America	LOCATION	.

		A sharp distinction is drawn between religious liberty and religious license , which , according to this Calvinistic divine , was being advocated by the Unitarians , who are represented as veritable wolves in the fold of truth .

		This was one of several addresses to evoke warm discussion , and the caustic reply drawn up by the outraged Unitarian minority is printed after the sermon .

		In sharp contrast is such an address as that of Dr.
Storrs	PERSON	for
1867	DATE	, which is direct , specific , and cogently pointed in its suggestions for a reversion to Puritan principles , but which is not barbed , and that in spite of the great con - troversy looming ahead .

		The uniqueness of the Pilgrim fathers is perhaps the dominant historical note of the series .

		Never came settlers to any land against such overwhelming odds or with such strange motives .

		Never was a colonial government so nobly planned .

		And as their reasons for coming to
America	LOCATION	were strange , so were the results they sought to achieve in their colony altogether foreign , in their strong accent upon spiritual - ity , to anything hitherto attempted .

		Other speakers prefer to go back of
1620	DATE	in order to trace the complicated course of events that differentiated the English reformation from the Europ ^ ean and led to the ostracism of these Protestants of the Protestants from their En - glish homes .

		Still others `` call attention to the influence upon the movement of the
Geneva	LOCATION	exiles , who had a chance to see a republican government in actual operation .

		A few speak - ers choose to consider the idiosyncrasies of the Puritans , -- men as unique in their faults as in their virtues , -- and to show the fallacies in the popular conception of the Pilgrims as sour - faced , iron-handed , hard-hearted bigots , whom happily their descendants have ceased to re - semble .

		All seem to be agreed that New En - gland is still , in some measure at least , repre - sentative of the Puritan spirit ; and all unite in praising the part she has played in the making of the nation .

		But enough of gener - alities .

		It is the specific in these speeches that attracts ; the detail that supports each familiar generalization that is of value .

		And for that the reader must go beyond a brief review to the book itself .

		There is necessarily some repetition of thought in so long a series on a single theme , but one can easily see why the Society wished to publish all , if any , of the available addresses .

		Besides , there is not one that does not make its individual contribution to the whole , that does not reach towards the high standard set by such men as
Webster	PERSON	,
Storrs	LOCATION	, and
Evarts	PERSON	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Hopkins	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	,
Choate	PERSON	, and
Emer	PERSON	- son .

		Most of the orations have not been pub - lished before except in rare pamphlets ; and merely as examples of forensic literature they are well worthy of the honor now paid them by the Society that called them forth .

		Yet it is not as eloquent tributes to a van - ished past that these orations are most vitally interesting , but rather as comments on their own time , as records of national progress through the century just ended , and as pro- phecies , warning yet hopeful , of the nation 's future .

		Slavery , the great problem of the period , is touched upon by almost every speaker .

		At first it is handled with truly Puritanical sternness , then more guardedly , with a gentle - ness born of greater knowledge of the magni - tude of the issue and the delicate position of the contestants , but with no less depth of feel - ing .

		This apparent growth of tolerance since
1820	DATE	and
1822	DATE	, when the Unitarian contro - versy was raging bitterly , or even since
1842	DATE	, when the dread of Catholic supremacy ex - pressed itself in unmeasured terras , can scarcely be understood as a chance result due to the individual temperaments of the various speak - ers .

		It rather represents a general change of attitude , a recognition of the modern tenet that the foe 's conviction may be as sincere and his motives as worthy as one 's own , and that in
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 any case nothing is to be gained by ungraciously insisting that he is altogether in the wrong .

		But to plume ourselves on the possession of this one virtue of tolerance in somewhat greater measure than our forefathers is to take but one , and that the smallest , view of a great theme .

		Not the little we might teach them , but the much that we should learn from them , and often have not , is the significant phase of the subject .

		And this is the unifying thread that runs through all these sermons and addresses and makes them of lasting value and real im - port for us , Puritans by descent it may be , but certainly heirs of the great heritage of the Puritans .


Edith Kellogg Dunton	PERSON	.

		Recent Books out the Trust Problem .

		* A prominent
Washington	LOCATION	o # B.cial well-known in statistical circles recently remarked , in a conversation , that '' the people do not care a rap about trusts . ''

		Opposed to this rather effete summary of a great question are the nu - merous editorials , magazine articles , and books on the subject now coming from the public press .

		The three volumes reviewed in the pres - ent article reflect the seriousness of the prob - lem and by no means bear out the indifference of the
Washington	LOCATION	official .

		Fundamentally , the problem is the old one of monopoly , -- and a very sharp distinction must be made between capital centralization and monopoly , so often confused in the pres - ent controversy .

		The first book , Le
Rossig	PERSON	- nol 's `` Monopolies , Past and Present , '' both by title and contents gives evidence ` of careful thought on these essential points in the prob - lem .

		The author of '' Commercial Trusts , '' however , takes it for granted that the attack on capital is due to centralization when in reality it is a question , as already pointed out , of monopoly .

		It is , however , to
Clark	PERSON	's '' The Control of Trusts '' that we must look for a definite programme in dealing with the ques - tions involved in the trust .

		About the word '' monopoly , '' then , clusters much of the discussion .

		writers contributes a different definition .

		In ''
Monopolies	ORGANIZATION	, Past and Present '' we are told that '' a monopoly is the control of the supply or the demand of an economic good , by one per - son or a combination of persons , to such an ex - tent that that person or combination of persons is able to control the price of the economic good . ''

		To this definition Mr.
Dos Passos	PERSON	ob - jects vigorously , declaring that a monopoly is '' an exclusive privilege , resting in the hands of one person or corporation , to the exclusion of everybody else , and to comprehend a monopoly you must realize that there can exist no mo - nopoly , unless it is exclusive '' ; which , if ac - cepted , virtually excludes all monopoly dis - cussion from the field of inquiry .

		We are still to look at the definition of the third writer , who puts it clearly and strongly , that '' to dom - inate weak rivals and to prevent strong ones from appearing , is to perform the act and to take on the character of a monopoly . ''

		That this is after all the fighting interpretation of the term , rather than the control of prices alone , is borne out by the recent events in the cele - brated
Northern Pacific	ORGANIZATION	merger .

		Three methods of solving the monopoly question and all that it involves are found in the laissez faire doctrine , socialism , and state regulation .

		Each has its advocates , the second lacking an exponent , however , in the trio of books under review .

		The '' let alone '' policy is vigorously maintained by the author of '' Commercial Trusts , '' who says , '' I claim that the natural laws of trade form a sufficient bar - rier to prevent or break up most commercial monopolies . ''

		Since exclusive possession is the essential element , no monopolies exist from his point of view .

		It is just here that Professor
Clark	PERSON	parts company , if he may be said to have kept company at all , with the orator be - fore the
Industrial Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is , on the contrary , always existent either actual or potential competition in every case of monopoly which can not long continue without the aid of the state .

		Certain it is that we can not rely upon the unaided forces of trade laws to pre - vent the abuses of monopoly .

		The laissez faire doctrine must give way to modern experience .

		In just so far as we confuse centralization and monopoly will our drift be toward social - if the darkness of the present hides the ism benefits of private property and individual ini - tiative , the more we shall look for state owner - ship as the only solution .

		Both the author of ■ `` Monopolies , Past and Present , '' who clearly shows that we are dealing with a very old 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, problem in a new form , and the author of '' The Control of Trusts '' have brighter things than a regime of state socialism in store for us .

		They regard state control as the means of retaining the good in the modern system and eliminating the evils .

		The thesis of Mr.
Le Rossignol	PERSON	's book may be stated in the author 's own words . ''

		The world moves in advancing cycles .

		First we have the monopolistic spirit of the Middle Ages .

		Then we have the competitive spirit of the industrial revo - lution .

		Again we pass into a period of monopoly and restriction of competition .

		In the first period we find public control and regulation of industry .

		In the second period we have the system of industrial liberty .

		May it not be that we are returning to a system of public control like and yet unlike that of ancient and mediaeval times ?

		The doctrine of the Canonists re - vive in the teachings of the modern Socialists .

		The ideals resume their sway over the human mind , new in form but old in spirit .

		As ever , they demand recogni - tion , they call for realization . ''

		It is is certainly pleasant to think that ideals are to predominate over commercialism .

		Just how this is to come about our author does not say , but in an able manner he points out the history , experience , dangers , and advantages of various forms of monopoly , ending his volume with the admonition that '' there is no need for extreme haste . ''

		A more positive programme is outlined in Professor
Clark	PERSON	's little book , whose thesis is put in this way : '' Monopoly power that is increasing and restrictions that are diminishing in force point to a time when something will have to be done in defence of property rights , if not personal liberty .

		The measures that it is possible to take are not many , but we shall soon see what they are , and try to make a selection from among them .

		Even now we can discern the principle which must dominate a sound policy in dealing with trusts .

		That principle is , first of all , to keep competition alive . ''

		But how is this result to be accomplished ?

		Certainly not by the repeal of the tariff , advocated so noisily by the press of the day .

		The problem is by no means so easy as that .

		In many instances the tariff sustains not only the trust but the industry itself .

		In such cases competition , the fundamental principle of the thesis , is destroyed .

		In fact , so far as the in - dependent producer is sustained by the tariff , it would be unwise to hastily remove it .

		This view , then , maintains that tariff revis - ion is an end to be secured , not a means of solving the trust problem .

		When once the monopolistic element is taken out of the trust it will be possible to do something with the tariff , otherwise an attack on the tariff throws the trust and the independent producers into the same rank under the fortunes of war .

		The great danger is that a corporation exacting a monopoly price at home may treat its export business as a secondary matter .

		To avoid this , monopoly power must be broken before a tariff war begins .

		The number of steps necessary to such a procedure are not numerous , though difficult : First , protection of the investor ; second , fair treatment of the independent producers by the railroads .

		This latter step will require pooling and government control .

		From Professor
Clark	PERSON	's point of view the key to the solution lies in the fact that the independent producer is a natural protector of all the other threatened interests .

		To withdraw the tariff is to destroy him , to maintain the tariff for the time regula - ting railroad discriminations is to give him a chance to exist .

		Certainly Professor
Clark	PERSON	's book has great value in the warning clearly pointed out against a wrong beginning .

		.

		All three of the writers believe in the trust as a form of organization .

		The question is .

		Can it not be deprived of its dangerous ele - ments and made a source of advancement to the community ?

		Professor
Clark	PERSON	believes that this can be done .

		THE DIAL 315 other hand , it was clearly the work of a man who cared little for technique , who was willing to ride roughshod over most of the canons of verse-rhetoric , and to whom the hest will in the world could not attribute the gift of the singing voice .

		The recent appearance of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's second and larger vol - ume , entitled '' Poems of the Past and the Present , '' justifies , with some slight modifications , these con - clusions based upon the earlier collection , and at the same time deepens our respect for the intellect which is here at work .

		For it is as an intellectual force that this volume must be measured , if any - thing like justice is to be done it .

		Every one of these poems has something to say , and usually it is something so well worth saying that defects in the manner of the expression may fairly be overlooked .

		Mr.

KOnigsberg	PERSON	, the insignificance of earth and all the works of man when contrasted with the vastness of the creation has been a theme to provoke perplexed questionings and inspire an awful solemnity of soul .

		It is so big a theme that the small poet who ventures upon it is bound to be luckless , for the best he can o # Per will be but a weak solution of the idea .

		Yet Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	can take so old an idea as this , and give it a restatement that is deeply im - pressive .

		The sonnet written '' At a Lunar Eclipse '' will , we believe , bear out this assertion . ''

		Thy Shadow ,
Earth	LOCATION	, from Pole to Central Sea , Now steals along upon the
Moon	PERSON	's meek shine In even monochrome and curving line Of imperturbable serenity . '

		* How shall I link such sun-oast symmetry With the torn troubled form I know as thine , That profile , placid as a brow divine .

		With continents of moil and misery ? ''

		And can immense Mortality but throw So small a shade , and
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's high human scheme Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies ?

		* ' Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show .

		Nation at war with nation , Brains that teem , Heroes , and women fairer than the skies ? ''

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is much preoccupied with the vanishing faiths of the past , and looks back with a certain wistfulness to the time when men could find conso - lation in what the clear intelligence of to-day must look upon as myth and baseless legend .

		`` In days when men had joy of war , A God of Battles sped each mortal jar ; The peoples pledged him heart and hand .

		From
Israel	LOCATION	's land to isles afar . '' ''

		I said to Love , ' It is not now as in old days When men adored thee and thy ways -RSB- All else above ; Named thee the Boy , the Bright , the One Who spread a heaven beneath the sun , '' I said to Love . ''

		Mars and Eros are now no more , and with them the other gods have taken flight .

		One thinks of
Schiller	PERSON	's plaint upon the same theme , but one misses the invincible optimism of
Schiller	PERSON	, who could find new consolations in the newly awakened hopes of mankind , and in the revolutionary gospel of human brotherhood .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's vision is too keen and his logic too relentless to permit him to resort to such anodynes .

		The bright new day that seemed to be dawning for mankind at the opening of the nineteenth century was overhung with dark - ness at the close of that century .

		How it seemed to Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	just as the century was going out may be gathered from this * ' Christmas Ghost Story ' * of
1899	DATE	: '' South of the Line , inland from far
Durban	LOCATION	, A mouldering soldier lies -- your countryman .

		Awry and doubled up are his gray bones .

		And on the breeze his puzzled phantom moans Nightly to clear Canopus : * I would know By whom and when ^ the All-Earth-gladdening Law Of Peace , brought in by that Man Crucified , Was ruled to be inept , and set aside ?

		And what of logic or of truth appears In tacking '' Anno Domini '' to the years ?

		Near twenty-hundred liveried thus have hied .

		But tarries yet the Cause for which He died . ' ''

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	comes very near to being a pessimist .

		This word is so often misapplied -- to impatient idealists of the Ibsen type , for example , who in - dignantly scourge the profaners of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	for its more speedy cleansing -- that we hesitate to use it , but of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	it must be said that he discerns but slight hope for the future of the race .

		He comes no nearer to such a vision of promise than in the doubtful prophecy of these lines : '' When shall the saner softer polities Whereof we dream have play in each proud land , And patriotism , grown Godlike , scorn to stand Bondslave to realms , but circle earth and seas ? ''

		Even the qualified hopefulness of this suggestion is rarely met with .

		The spirit of the poet 's own relentless motto , '' Let there be truth at last , Even if despair , '' urges his thought implacably to the absolute pes - simism of such a poem as '' ' His Immortality , '' or of such a stanza as this concluding one of ' < De Profundis '' : '' Black is night 's cope ; But death will not appal One who , past doubtings all .

		Waits in unhope . ''

		Meanwhile , allowing the question of the future to be just barely debatable , the present is clearly out of joint .

		The group of war-poems , one of which has just been quoted , makes the poet 's opinion clear enough , and it is still further enforced by a revery at
Lausanne	LOCATION	, in which the spirit of the historian to whom the place is consecrated puts these questions : '' ' How fares the Truth now !?

		-- 111 ?

		-- Do pens but slily further her advance ^ ?

		May one not speed her but in phrase askance ?

		Do scribes aver the Comic to be Reverend stilli ?

		316 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, '' ' Still rale those minds on earth At whom sage
Milton	LOCATION	's wormwood words were hurled : '' Truth like a bastard comes into the world Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth '' ? ' ''

		In all the rhetorical armory of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	irony is the weapon most frequently and effectively used .

		In this volame examples are not far to seek , and they vary from what is unrelieved tragedy to what is merely pathos tinged with melancholy .

		Our ex - ample shall he of the less poignant sort , taken from the poem on the Pyramid of Cestius .

		* ' Who , then , was Cestius , And what is he to me ?

		-- Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous One thought alone brings he . ''

		I can recall no word Of anything he did ; For me he is a man who died and was interred To leave a pyramid . ''

		Whose purpose was exprest Not with its first design , Xor till , far down in time , beside it found their rest Two countrymen of mine . ''

		Taken as a whole , this volume of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's poems makes an important contrihution to our liter - ature .

		This is due to its thought rather than to its expression , to its weight rather than to its grace , for the author is weighty even when he essays the triolet and the villanelle .

		The dates attached to some of these poems indicate that the author has been writing verse for many years past , and that his new departure is in their publication , not in their composition .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	is unmistakably endowed with the lyric gift , although he takes delight in ragged and robustious measures .

		His songs are more suggestive of the blare of trumpets than of the tinkling of lutes , yet they are nevertheless songs .

		Fancies are not for this singer , who is content with nothing less than a revelation of the very core of passion , as , for example , in this striking set of couplets : '' Love , which is Lust , is the Lamp in the Tomb .

		Love , which is Lust , is the Call from the Gloom . ''

		Love , which is Lust , is the Main of Desire .

		Love , which is Lust , is the Centric Fire . ''

		So man and woman will keep their trust .

		Till the very Springs of the Sea run dust .

		`` Yes , each with the other will lose and win , Till the very Sides of the Grave fall in . ''

		For the strife of Love 's the abysmal strife , And the word of Love is the Word of Life . ''

		And they that go with the Word unsaid , Though they seem of the living , are damned and dead . ''

		There is nothing of sentimental pallor in such verse as this , but rich color as of wine , and heat as of the orb of day .

		It is not often that Mr.
Henley	PERSON	works in tints as neutral as those of the following lovely lines . ''

		The downs , like uplands in
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, Gleam in an afterglow Like a rose-world ruining earthwards -- Mystical , wistful , slow ! ''

		Near and afar in the leafage .

		That last glad call to the nest !

		And the thought of you hangs and triumphs With
Hesper	PERSON	low in the west ! ''

		Till the song and the light and the colour .

		The passion of earth and sky .

		Are blent in a rapture of boding Of the death we should one day die . ''

		These two songs represent perhaps the extremes of the collection called '' Hawthorn and Lavender , '' which is a real addition to the English lyric treas - ury .

		The '' London Types '' that follow are more like the racy earlier work of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	.

		In the form of the Shakespearian sonnet they depict such figures as the bus driver , the hawker , and the sand - wich man .

		The barmaid is thus described : '' Her head 's a work of art , and , if her eyes Be tired and ignorant , she has a waist ; Cheaply the Mode she shadows ; and she tries From penny novels to amend her taste ; And , having mopped the zinc for certain years .

		And faced the gas , she fades and disappears . ''

		Finally , Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's volume gives us a group of `` Epicedia , '' which includes his magnificent tribute '' ReginsB Dilectissimse Victoriae , '' than which no nobler song was evoked by the death of the Queen . ''

		Think , when she passed .

		Think what a pageant of immortal acts .

		Done in the unapproachable face Of time by the high , transcending human mind ,
Shone	PERSON	and acclaimed And triumphed in her advent !

		Think of the ghosts , Think of the mighty ghosts : soldiers and priests ^ Artists and captains of discovery , God 's chosen .

		His adventurers up the heights Of thought and deed -- how many of them that led The forlorn hopes of the World !

		-- Her peers and servants , made the air Of her death-chamber glorious !

		Think how they thronged About her bed , and with what pride They took this sister-ghost Tenderly into the night ! ''

		From this high level of superb imaginative utter - ance the whole long poem does not for a moment decline .

		Here is the voice of a laureate by divine right , needing no official distinction for its recog - nition .

		As
Browning	PERSON	said , '' Why crown whom Zeus hath crowned in soul before ? ''

		Among these commemorative pieces , the sonnet dedicated to the memory of
Thomas Edward Brown	PERSON	, is so truthful a portrait as well as so beautiful a poem that it must be reproduced . ''

		He looked half-parson and half-skipper : a quaint , Beautiful blend , with blue eyes good to see .

		And old-world whiskers .

		You found him cynic , saint .

		Salt , humourist , Christian , poet ; with a free .

		Far-glancing , luminous utterance ; and a heart Large as St.
Francis	PERSON	's : withal a brain Stored with experience , letters , fancy , art , And scored with runes of human joy and pain .

		Till six-and-sixty years he used his gift .

		His gift unparalleled , of laughter and tears .

		And left the world a high-piled , golden drift Of verse : to grow more golden with the years , Till the Great Silence fallen upon his ways Break into Song , and he that had Love have Praise . ''

		The volume that offers all these things , and many more of equal beauty , is a gift indeed .

		THE DIAL .

		317 To bend the bow of
Ulysses	LOCATION	, to take up once more the most pathettc and human of Greek tales , to restore the figure that Homer clothed with thought and wisdom , that
Dante	PERSON	and Tennyson in - vested with new attributes of spiritual mystery -- this has been the latest task of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, and it falls fairly within the reach of his powers .

		Not an original poet , he has shown himself to be an imitative poet of remarkable parts , and particularly , both in his `` Herod '' and his '' Paolo and Fran - cesca , '' he has exhibited the capacity for reviving and fashioning in modern guise the old-world story about which the emotion of centuries has gradually collected .

		For a poet of his talent the selection of a subject is half the battle , and he has been as happy in his selection of the Ithacan wan - derer as he was in his selection of the lovers of
Rimini	LOCATION	. ''

		Ulysses '' is a drama in a prologue and three acts .

		It is not Homer alone that the drama recalls , for Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	is eclectic in his method , and no little of his inspiration in the present case has come from Germanic sources .

		The prologue is an echo of the '' Prolog im
Himmel	PERSON	'' of ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' and in the first act -- the parting from
Calypso	LOCATION	-- there is not a little of the feeling of Tannhauser in the
Venusberg	LOCATION	.

		The prologue is a distinctly un - fortunate invention or imitation .

		The deep irony of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's pantheon is missing , and we have instead such lumbering humor as the defence of Zeus , when twitted with his own escapades for the purposes of arousing his sympathies in behalf of the hero held captive in
Ogygia	LOCATION	. ''

		` Tia time that earthly women had their share In this large bosom 's universal care .

		That
Danae	PERSON	,
Leda	LOCATION	,
Leto	PERSON	, all had place In my most broad beneficent embrace : True that we gods who on
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	dwell With mortal passion sympathize too well . ''

		We are glad to get past this luckless attempt at the serio-comic , and into the entirely serious tale of the hero .

		What is probably the finest passage of the poem is the outburst of
Ulysses	LOCATION	when he declares himself to
Calypso	LOCATION	.

		`` Then have the truth ; I speak as a man speaks ; Pour out my heart like treasure at your feet .

		This odorous amorous isle of violets , That leans all leaves into the glassy deep .

		With brooding music over noontide moss .

		And low dirge of the lily-swinging bee , -- Then stars like opening eyes on closing flowers , -- Palls on my heart .

		Ah , God !

		that I might see Gaunt
Ithaca	LOCATION	stand up out of the surge .

		Yon lashed and streaming rocks , and sobbing crags .

		The screaming gull and the wild-flying cloud : -- To see far off the smoke of my own hearth , To smell far out the glebe of my own farms , To
spring	DATE	alive upon her precipices .

		And hurl the singing spear into the air ; To scoop the mountain torrent in my hand .

		And plunge into the midnight of her pines ; To look into the eyes of her who bore me .

		And clasp his knees who ` gat me in his joy , Prove if my son be like my dream of him .

		We two have played and tossed each other words ; Goddess and mortal we have met and kissed .

		Now am I mad for silence and for tears , For the earthly voice that breaks at earthly ills .

		The mortal hands that make and smooth the bed .

		I am an-hungered for that human breast , That bosom a sweet hive of memories -- There , there to lay my head before I die , There , there to be , there only , there at last I '' The second act is the descent into hell , and the third the return to
Ithaca	LOCATION	.

		This last act has all the familiar incidents of the swineherd , the nurse who recognizes her master by the boar 's scar , the insolent mockery of the old man by the suitors , the sign of
Athena	ORGANIZATION	, and the palace become a slaughter-house .

		This part of the story tells itself , and commands , as it has done for three thousand years , the rapt at - tention and the responsive tears of those to whom it is told .

		When the eyes grow dim as one pathetic incident after another is unfolded , it is to Homer that their tribute is paid rather than to Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, yet we would not be grudging of our admiration for the skill with which the English poet has made use of the material thus brought to his hand .

		He has made a poem that may be read -LRB- except for the prologue -RRB- with unalloyed satisfaction , and he has at the same time written a play that deserves to hold the stage , not merely as a dramatic curiosity , but as a permanent addition to the serious repertory of a regenerated English drama .

		Six collections of verse in thirteen years is the record of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		The sixth collection , entitled '' The Loom of Dreams , '' added to a re - issue of all that the author cares to preserve out of the other five , is given us in the two volumes of '' Poems '' now published .

		The occasion is conse - quently fitting to say a few words concerning the entire poetical product of this talented writer , rather than merely to give an example of his latest work .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is clearly a poet who will have to be reckoned with in future estimates of the recent period , by virtue of the exquisite delicacy and sen - sibility of a portion of his work , rather than by virtue of any special message or inspiration that , may be gathered from his work as a whole .

		Con - sidered as a whole , indeed , that work is so alien to English ideals of beauty and of conduct that it must be regarded as a '' sport '' rather than as a natural blossoming of English speech .

		Its frank sensuality and its morbid eroticism are characteristics reflected from the French decadents -- from
Baudelaire	LOCATION	and
Verlaine	PERSON	-- rather than illustrations of the noble spiritual tradition of
Shelley	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	remains in successive vol - umes , and with consistent purpose , what
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	were at moments only , the poet of the flesh .

		We forgive this trait in
Rossetti	PERSON	on the score of his Italian blood and his marvellous artistry ; we forgive it in
Browning	LOCATION	because it was coupled with robust intellectual vigor ; we forgive it in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	because it was only a passing phase -- a boyish fling -- redeemed a hun - dred times over by the exaltation of the spirit which is Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's most marked quality .

		But the Puritan in us can hardly forgive a man who year S18 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, after year plays upon the strings of sense , and runs the whole gamut of carnal passion until , satiety being achieved , he can find no nobler refuge than a nauseating mixture of faint sensuality and relig - ious mysticism .

		As long as he can hold to it , the motto of his song seems to be that of these lines from `` Liber Amoris '' -- lines that derive directly from Baudelaire : '' What 's virtue ,
Bianca	PERSON	?

		Have we not Agreed the word should be forgot .

		That ours be every dear device And all the subtleties of vice , And , in diverse imaginings .

		The savour of forbidden things , '' Our quotation must close abruptly with the comma , because what follows is unfit for decent print .

		But `` ven this sort of thing is better than the mawkish religiosity of the mood that succeeds . ''

		O Most High !

		I will pray , look down through the seven Passionate veils of heaven , Out of eternal peace , where the world 's desire Enfolds thee in veils of fire ; Holy of
Holies	LOCATION	, the immaculate Lamb , Behold me , the thing I am I I , the redeemed of thy blood , the bought with a price .

		The reward of thy sacrifice , I , who walk with thy saints in a robe of white , And who worship thee day and night .

		Behold me , the thing I am , and do thou beat back These feet that burn on my track . ''

		The feet are those of the dogs of sensual desire , but there is no real repentance in the prayer , only a subtler form of the self-indulgence that has brought this pitiful soul to so pitiful a pass .

		The unwholesome character of these poems by Mr.
Symons	PERSON	has to be emphasized because their verbal magic is potent to charm even when they glorify what is most base in human nature .

		How pure and true a poet Mr.
Symons	PERSON	can be at his best may be illustrated by these lovely verses written at
Montserrat	LOCATION	: '' Peace waits among the hills ; I have drunk peace , Here , where the blue air fills The great cup of the hills .

		And fills with peace . ''

		Between the earth and sky , I have seen the earth Like a dark cloud go by .

		And fade out of the sky ; There was no more earth .

		* ' Here , where the Holy Graal Brought secret light Once , from beyond the veil , I , seeing no Holy Graal , See divine light .

		* ' Light fills the hills with God , Wind with his breath .

		And here , in his abode , Light , wind , and air praise God , And this poor breath . ''

		One more lyric , representing the author 's latest work , must be quoted .

		It is called '' The Crying of Water . '' ''

		O water , voice of my heart , crying in the sand , All night long crying with a mournful cry .

		As Ilie and listen , and can not understand The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea , water , crying for rest , is it I , is it I ?

		All night long the water is crying to me . ''

		Unresting water , there shall never be rest Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail .

		And the fire of the end begin to burn in the west ; And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea .

		All life long crying without avail .

		As the water all night long is crying to me . ''

		This seems to us one of the most beautiful things in English song ; its tender pathos is fairly matched by the subtle music of the verse , and the result is quite beyond criticism .

		A very slender sheaf of such verse as this would outweigh all the contents of these two substantial volumes .

		In the metrical freedom as well as in the natural imagery of the later work of Mr.
Symons	PERSON	the at - tentive ear may cateh echoes , not alone of
Verlaine	PERSON	and his fellows , but also of the neo-Celtic movement in English poetry .

		Let us set by the side of the poem last quoted this stanza by another writer : '' O sands of my heart , what wind moans low along thy shadowy shore ?

		Is that the deep sea-heart I hear with the dying sob at its core ?

		Each dim lost wave that lapses is like a closing door : 'T is closing doors they hear at last who soon shall hear no more .

		Who soon shall hear no more . ''

		The two poems might have been written by the same hand , yet the one just illustrated is the work , not of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, but of Miss ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	. ''

		We take it from a recent selection of her songs , containing pieces both old and new , and entitled '' From the Hills of Dream . ''

		Having made the one extract for the purpose of indicating a parallelism of sentiment and artistic method , we we will make one more for the sake of its own sheer loveliness . ''

		Dim face of Beauty haunting all the world .

		Fair face of Beauty all too fair to see .

		Where the lost stars adown the heavens are hurled , There , there alone for thee
May	DATE	white peace be . ''

		For here where all the dreams of men are whirled Like sere torn leaves of autumn to and fro , There is no place for thee in all the world , Who drif test as a star .

		Beyond , afar . ''

		Beauty , sad face of Beauty , Mystery , Wonder , What are these dreams to foolish babbling men -- Who cry with little noises ` neath the thunders Of ages ground to sand .

		To a little sand . ''

		Simplicity of diction , subtlety of thought , and absolute sincerity are the qualities which give dis - tinction to the poetry of Mrs.
Alice Meynell	PERSON	.

		She publishes little because she is too severe a censor of her own work to allow it to stream forth unre - strained .

		Her own artistic conscience must be sat - isfied , and then the reader may say what he will .

		Her '' Later Poems '' constitute a volume even more slender than the earlier '' Poems '' that won the applause of such critics as
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and

		THE DIAL , 319
Patmore	PERSON	.

		They include nothing quite equal to '' Renouncement '' and one or two other pieces of the earlier collection , but it is also true that they contain nothing that we would willingly spare .

		We quote '' A Dead Harvest , '' one of the most ex - quisite of them all . ''

		Along the graceless grass of town They rake the rows of red and brown , Dead leaves , unlike the rows of hay , Delicate , neither gold nor grey , Baked long ago and far away . ''

		A narrow silence in the park ; Between the lights a narrow dark .

		One street rolls on the north , and one , Ma # B.ed , upon the south doth run .

		Amid the mist the work is done . ''

		A futile crop ; for it the fire Smoulders , and , for a stack , a pyre .

		So go the town 's lives on the breeze , Even as the sheddings of the trees ; Bosom nor barn is filled with these . ''

		There are less than a score of pieces altogether , but they are of precious metal , almost without alloy .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	has spent the past winter in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , and has doubtless learned , among other things surprising to an Englishwoman , that the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	has a stimulating intellectual atmos - phere as well as a tonic physical climate .

		The number of far Western books that compel attention is rapidly increasing from year to year , and pres - ages a possible future in which the region which the late
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	called `` our
Italy	LOCATION	'' may charm us by art as it now charms us by nature .

		The volume of '' Poems '' by
Miss Irenfe Hardy	PERSON	has much of the characteristic Western breeziness and originality so attractive to the jaded senses of the older civilizations , yet it ofEers work which is by no means lawless in form , and which maintains the tradition of good English verse .

		We might em - phasize its local coloring by a series of extracts , but prefer , on the whole , to find our illustrative example in a piece which savors of no time or place .

		It is a sonnet on the sonnet , which is a peculiarly difficult thing to write well enough to arouse more than a languid interest .

		Miss Hardy has done this difficult thing , as these lines attest : '' The sonnet is the violet of song , A flower that springs responsive to the rain Of tears , or to the heart when under strain Of joy so deep that silence would do wrong To life and love ; then lyric phrases throng The thought , intoning , rise and
fall	DATE	, -- again , Again , -- like evening bells in low refrain , As if the words the passion would prolong .

		O thou that seekest to make this little flower
Bloom	PERSON	in thy garden-plot of poesy , Behold how dear it was to laureate Kings And plant thou , too , in sacred earth and bower ; And men shall love thee in the years to be As one who loved and cherished loveliest things . ''

		The `` Ode for Forefathers ' Day '' which closes Miss Hardy 's volume is peculiarly interesting as the tribute of a Western writer to the idealism upon which our nation was founded .

		It is also a noble poem , from which we gladly quote . ''

		As Homer saw the Prospect Wide , nor knew The bounds by Nature set , nor dreamed nor thought to dream How great man 's mind should one day make it seem .

		The Pilgrim Heroes , from their mount of vision , drew .

		With eye of faith a far perspective , true To God-given promise , yet to them too dim For all surmise , except obedience to Him .

		In a land they did not know , transplanted side by side .

		Their love and hope and faith , these three , till now abide . ''

		Another book of verse from the same far Western country is called ''
California	LOCATION	Violets , '' and is the work of
Miss Grace Hibbard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title is aptly chosen , for modesty and dewy freshness are proper words to describe these unpretending lyrics . ''

		A White Chrysanthemum '' is a typical example . ''

		Last night beside my hearthstone She sat in snowy dress ; The firelight touched her golden hair With many a fond caress .

		`` She wore white autumn flowers .

		Like frozen stars they seemed ; One flower she left , else I should think Of angels I had dreamed . ''

		Some verses on `` The Man without the Hoe '' are worth mentioning . '

		^ No flights of fancy are his , No flutterings up to the stars ; No beating of feeble hands Upon Fate 's unyielding bars .

		`` Sing not of chains unto him .

		To the man who holds the hoe , For mighty 's his brawny arm .

		And powerful to o'erthrow .

		`` But pity , your pity , I crave .

		For the man without the hoe .

		Slender fingers , blue-veined brow , Oh , many such one you know . '' ''

		The Arcadian Library '' is a new series of small volumes of verse , and '' The Watchers of the Hearth , '' by Mr.
Benjamin Sledd	PERSON	, is the first volume .

		Mr.
Sledd	PERSON	's verses are of the gentle contemplative sort , marked by an instinctive refinement , breath - ing a tempered melancholy and a delicate pathos .

		`` The Wraith of
Roanoke	LOCATION	'' is a good example . ''

		Like a mist of the sea at morn it comes .

		Gliding among the fisher-homes , -- The vision of a woman fair ; And every eye beholds her there Above the topmost dune , With fluttering robe and streaming hair .

		Seaward gazing in dumb despair , Like one who begs of the waves a boon . ''

		Lone ghost , of the daring few who came And , passing , left but a tree-carved name And the mystery of Groatan : And out of our country 's dawning years I hear the weeping of woman 's tears : With a woman 's eyes I dimly scan Day after day the far blue verge .

		And pray of the loud unpitying surge .

		And every wind of heaven , to urge The sails that alone can succor her fate , -- The wigwam dark and the savage mate .

		The love more cruel than crudest hate , -- Still burns on her cheek that fierce hot breath , -- And the shame too bitter to hide in death . ''

		The following exquisite descriptive bit must be added before taking leave of Mr.

May 1	DATE	, `` Over the
summer	DATE	lands , The blossoming clouds float by , -- Pure lilies flung from angel hands On the broad blue deep of the sky ; Or caught on the mountain strands In restless heaps they lie . '' ''

		The Soul-at-Arms and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
James Robinson Smith	PERSON	, is a volume not unlike the preceding one in sentiment and refinement , although perhaps dealing with a more abstract order of ideas .

		But , however philosophical the burden of these verses , there is nearly always something to bring them into direct touch with concrete human life .

		This touch is more evident than usual in the following sonnet , with its impressive ethical lesson : '' The streets were angry on that starless night With people hungry for their daily bread .

		I stood confounded , till , above my head , A pale-lit window drew me to its height .

		A man was bending near a candle-light , And when I asked him what he did , he said , ' Beside my wish for eating and my bed , I make me learn a little English right . '

		The crowd stood cursing its inhuman fate .

		Or sat contented in its misery , While he , as poor as they and starving , late And early steers his chosen destiny .

		We are what we set out for , and the great And blest of old are with us as we try . ''

		The sonnet and the quatrain are Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's favor - ite forms , and the latter deserves illustration no less than the former . ''

		His better words are lonely as his ways .

		Though human friendship is his great desire .

		He dreams of olive peace through precious days , But finds contentment in consuming fire . ''

		Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	is known to a wide circle of readers as the pungent commentator upon books and manners who enlivens the pages of '' Life . ''

		That he can turn a neat bit of verse is also fairly well known , although the extent of his versifying , as revealed by his newly-published ``
Bramble Brae	PERSON	, '' may prove to some a surprise .

		He courts the occasional , personal , or bookish muse , for the most part , although he sometimes resorts to the more general inspirations of natural beauty and the tender sentiment of the common human rela - tions .

		His highest strain is reached in such a poem as ' < A Toast to Our Native Land . '' ''

		Huge yet alert , irascible yet strong .

		We make our fitful way ` mid right and wrong .

		One time we pour out millions to be free , Then rashly sweep an empire from the sea !

		One time we strike the shackles from the slaves , And then , quiescent , we are ruled by knaves .

		Often we rudely break restraining bars , And confidently reach out toward the stars .

		`` Yet under all these flows a hidden stream Sprung from the

		This is the Land we love , our heritage .

		We have often thought -LRB- and said -RRB- that some of the best of literary criticism is written in verse , and cer - tain of the pieces by Mr. Bridges `` Written in Books '' would serve well to illustrate the proposition . ''

		Here is a forest tangle -- Rank weeds , luxuriant ferns , and giant trees , All in a hoarse-voiced wrangle .

		With creaking branches swaying in the breeze .

		But if you care to listen .

		Above the noise you 'll hear the piping of a bird .

		Gay feathers in the tree-tops glisten .

		And over all the sweetest music ever heard . ''

		One does not have to think long before realizing that this is a description of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	's poetry .

		We will leave our readers to guess which particular sensational novelist of the day is de - scribed in the following couplet : `` He sits in a sea-green grotto with a bucket of lurid paint , And draws the Thing as it is n't for the God of Things as they ai n't ! ''

		Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	has a subtle lyrical gift , although we have sometimes thought that he exercised it too frequently or on too slight occa - sion .

		We do not have this thought in turning over the volume which he quite simply calls '' Lyrics , '' for this volume is a selection from the best material of its predecessors , supplemented by a few poems now published for the first time .

		Being a selection only from a much larger mass of material , this vol - ume has a high average quality , and should notably enhance Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	's reputation .

		The nature - lyric is the species of composition which he most affects , and here is one of half a hundred examples . ''

		Mute the ferny woodland ways , Hushed the merry meadow-lays ; Stillness all and heavy haze Of the charmed
August	DATE	days .

		In the hollow , on the steep .

		Dwells a silence long and deep ; Not the smallest whisper , now .

		Of the secrets of the bough ; In his glory hid , alone .

		Sits the hill god on his throne . '' ''

		No great thing , '' the reader may say , and the reply must be , '' Certainly not '' -- yet there is an elusive music in the lines that makes them seem very charming .

		With what gravity and justice of view Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	can handle a more serious theme may be well illustrated by his lines on the death of the Queen .

		`` Answer the cabin and the hunting-shed The voice of mourning in the royal halls ; The shadow crawls upon the crowned head .

		From out her palsied hand the sceptre falls .

		So .

		Wrap her in the banner from her walls ; The word of sorrow , why should it be said ?

		Hark 1 up and down the earth gray honor calls , And the long glories gather round her bed .

		Through all the years her people have been fed , Yea , the wild ox has fatted in her stalls ; To islands of the sea her lines have spread .

		Proud sons of song have sung her madrigals .

		Come , robe her not in white , and stand and weep ; Wrap round the banner-fold , and let her sleep , '' It is interesting to place this tribute to the
august	DATE	shade of Victoria beside the tribute , more impas - sioned , but not more sincere , quoted from one of the Queen 's own subjects in an earlier section of this review .

		3 ^ Briefs on
Netv Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		The death , on
February 6 , 1900	DATE	, of ^ r ^ hutorian of gj ^
William Wilson Hunter	PERSON	, deprived BrUuh
India	LOCATION	.

		r > t ^ e < • i ^ • ■ , i r JbLingland of one of those builders of colonial empire to vrhose energies the nation owes much of her present greatness .

		Hunter 's life , as portrayed by Mr.
F. H. Skrine	PERSON	, exhibits a man of superior ability , with high purposes not unmixed with great personal ambition , gifted as a writer and rarely qualified as an organizer .

		His career may be divided logically into three distinct epochs .

		Born in
1840	DATE	, in
Scotland	LOCATION	, equipped with a satis - factory education , he had to carve out his own fortune , and with characteristic energy he sought and won in open competition a modest place in the civil service of
India	LOCATION	.

		From
1862	DATE	to
1887	DATE	he remained with the Indian government , advanc - ing step by step from a minor position to that of chief of the department of statistics and publication .

		His genius lay in the direction of literary presen - tation , and to his pen , more than to that of any other , Englishmen are indebted for a knowledge and appreciation of the vital conditions of Indian government .

		His monumental work , '' The Impe - rial Gazeteer of
India	LOCATION	, '' furnished a fund of infor - mation unsurpassed in its time as an example of useful statistical compilation .

		This was , however , but one of his many activities ; for not only was he an efl & cient worker in ordinary departmental admin - istration , but he was constantly occupied in histor - ical studies of Indian states and peoples , in the pub - lication of books resulting from these studies , in the weekly production of leading articles for at least two papers in
India	LOCATION	, and in correspondence with
London	LOCATION	journals .

		His articles for the press are numberless , while of printed works some twenty complete volumes of descriptive writing and thirty - eight volumes of statistics testify to the intensive energy of the man .

		In
1883	DATE	Hunter returned to
England	LOCATION	, and immediately became an authority at home upon Indian questions , filling the position of an expert in this field for '' The Times . ''

		Besides many biographies and histories written or edited in this last period , he had entered upon the prepa - ration of a history of British
India	LOCATION	, of which the first volume was printed two years ago , and he was at work upon the second at the time of his death .

		Judging from the first volume , it is not too much to say that had he been permitted to complete the '' British
India	LOCATION	'' he would have ranked as one of the great historians of modern times , not perhaps in the way of detailed scientific examination , but in the power to grasp great causes and great move - ments , and in the ability to portray them in attrac - tive form .

		Mr.
Skrine	PERSON	's biography of Hunter is not impartial , and it is not scientific .

		The author was in a certain way a protigS of Hunter 's , and is not free to adopt a critical attitude .

		Hunter , like other strong men , made many enemies and aroused much criticism ; yet this does not appear in the present volume .

		He was of sufficient importance to have merited an accurate historical biography , one that would have presented both sides of con - troverted questions .

		Nevertheless , the volume as it stands is wholly readable ; and the author has at least done well in leaving much of his narrative to per - sonal letters .

		These couched in Hunter 's own attrac - tive style are charming and valuable .

		A prophecy of the future of
Italy	LOCATION	■ ^ / S ^ '' '' ' ^ ^ ^ ^ 8 ® ^ `` P < * ° ^ ^ ® introductory chapter * '' • ^ '' '' * of ``
Italy	LOCATION	To-Day '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , the joint production of Mr.
Bolton King	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomas Okey	PERSON	, would be a very gloomy one .

		It would , indeed , be difficult to draw a more sombre picture than that presented of the disordered na - tional finances , the industrial distress , the weakness and irresolution of government , and in particular of the all pervading corruption in political circles .


New York	LOCATION	under Tweed was pure in comparison with the Italian government in its unblushing sale of important contracts and privileges .

		The utter lack of any principle of public honesty in govern - ment necessarily implies a national blindness to the enormity of the offense .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, in truth , the student of history may easily discover in the cor - ruption of to-day the elements that once constituted the essentials of social and political conditions in many of the petty states in former centuries .

		United
Italy	LOCATION	is a modern product .

		The absorption of many governments in one , the assertion of mod - ern doctrines of political right , the adoption of the outward forms of a progressive state , are not the sole nor even the principal factors of strength and permanence .


Italy	LOCATION	is just realizing that formal unity in government is but the first step toward perfected nationality .

		Yet it is at least an evidence of progress that this fact is now fully grasped by the leaders in all domains of intellectual activity ; and in this the authors find the greatest hope for the future .

		In their view , the vital necessity of the moment is not so much the enactment of rem - edial social legislation as the adoption by political parties of some definite ideals .

		The monarchy , deprived of the popularity which was its strength in the first years of union , is no longer a force bind - ing
Italy	LOCATION	together .

		Parliamentary government , reinforced and purified by guiding principles , may still furnish the tie , but at present the Socialists are the only purists .

		Old ideals no longer exist , and , in the dearth of spiritual or uplifting causes , politics and corruption have become synonymous .

		National leaders are without honor and professedly without hope ; they must give place to newer men of higher purpose .

		The signs are not wanting that such a change is imminent .

		In spite , therefore , of the candid and instructive exposition and analysis of the evils existent in the outward manifestations of Italian life , as they shape themselves in politics and in social movements , the thesis is maintained with vigor '' that underneath the slough of misgov - ernment and corruption and political apathy there is a rejuvenated nation , instinct with the qualities 822 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, that make a great people . ''

		Where so much evil exists , the struggle for betterment must needs be severe , and it may be violent ; but the future , it is asserted , is distinctly hopeful .

		In interest , clear - ness of treatment , and thoroughness of examination , the book is a valuable contribution to the study of Italian politics .

		Nature , art , ^ desire to cover too large a field is literature , and apparent in Mrs.
Ellen Russell	PERSON	Em - other matters .

		Q ^ ^ on ^ B `` Nature and Human Na - ture '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Literature , language , and art , including music , also come in for discussion .

		In her treatment of art , and symbolism in art , the author shows herself most at home , despite an occa - sional fanciful idea or far-fetched analogy .

		Her interpretation of the LaocoOn as suggesting , in the serpents ' undulating folds , '' the gliding stanchless waves of the sea , against whose onward movement there is no barrier , '' is new to us .

		Were Poseidon the offended divinity in the case , this reading of the symbol would be more plausible .

		But the temp - tation to subtilize on art , as
Lessing	PERSON	says in his `` Laokoon , '' sometimes leads one into whimsical theories .

		As an interpreter of nature , Mrs.
Emer	PERSON	- son is helpful .

		Passing to letters , she asserts that when a poet willingly becomes a translator of an - other 's verse , he thereby stands confessed as a minor poet .

		Hence she refuses to recognize Long - fellow and
Bryant	PERSON	as great poets .

		Leaving Pope out of the account , does she forget that
Goethe	PERSON	and
Schiller	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	also tried their hand at translating ?

		Or would she deny greatness to them as well ?

		Evidently not ; for she afterwards speaks of
Browning	PERSON	in the same breath with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ascribing to both the * ' balance of heart and brain '' that marks the true poet .

		The writer 's thought , it must be said in conclusion , suffers for lack of terse - ness and incisiveness in its presentation .

		We choose , almost at random , a sentence that cries out for the pruning-knife , -- `` Interpretation of the sublimity of an uplift of rock , forest , and tableland is product of a vision dependent on the soul 's sight , and sublimity is not more intrinsic to mountainous scenery than is color to a garden of flowers . ''

		The Gallicism in the following is so harsh , and so un - necessary , as to merit censure , -- '' Scientific discov - ery , indeed , has laid its axe to the root of many errors , and among which the error of self-impor - tance is not the least conspicuous . ''

		May linguistic discovery soon lay its axe to the root of this error of speech !

		A number of new or little-used words , as `` sculptuary '' -LRB- i. q. sculpture -RRB- , `` bolide , '' `` land - scapist , '' are encountered in Mrs.
Emerson	PERSON	's pleas - ant pages .

		The title '' The Jew as a Patriot '' l'Sir ; i. -LRB-
Balder & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- fitly describes the little book which the Rev. Mr.
Peters	PERSON	, a Baptist clergyman of
New York	LOCATION	, has packed full of statistics illustrating the leadership of men of Hebrew birth or lineage in the world 's enterprises .

		His object is to furnish a thesis in reply to
Mark Twain	PERSON	's magazine article , which presented the Jew as `` charged with a patriotic disinclination to stand by the flag as a soldier , '' and as '' by his make and his ways , substantially a foreigner wherever he may be . ''

		Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	's subsequent apology was but partial , in saying as he did that when publishing his article he '' was ignorant , like the rest of the Christian world , that the Jew had a record as a soldier . ''

		Mr.
Peters	PERSON	's rapid summary of the patriotic record made by the Jews in the American Civil War merely states facts which were well known to those engaged in that war , and Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	's confession of ignorance should not have attempted to screen itself behind what he imagined to be '' the rest of the Christian world . ''

		But Mr.
Peters	PERSON	shows , further , an equally credit - able record of Hebrew patriotism , military , civil , political , and financial , in the earlier wars of the American republic , and also in the history of sev - eral of the leading states of
Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	.

		So far from being singled out for reproach in any respect , the Jew is entitled to especial credit for not suffering his patriotism to be in any degree weakened by the cosmopolitan character which the accidents of history have imposed upon his race .

		His universal patriotism , local wherever the Jew himself becomes locally domiciled , entitles him to the high encomium of a true '' citizen of the world '' ; and this characteristic has been well illustrated in Mr.
Peters	PERSON	's monograph .

		In his zeal for his chosen clients , our author goes further , and in a concluding chapter expounds generally the indebt - edness of the world to the Jewish race .

		In one chapter , occupying nine pages , personal examples of their preeminence in poetry and the drama , in music , art , and science , in law , history , and criti - cism , are furnished in profusion . ''

		No man , '' he says , '' needs to apologize for belonging to a race which has produced such poets . ''

		And on the sub - ject of the Hebrews as money-makers , his statistics show that they are , in the great mass , people in poor and humble circumstances , and that the great capi - talists among them are but few .

		America , whose fair and impartial treatment of her Hebrew citizens has done much to atone for the slights put upon this proscribed race before the advent of the
Great Republic	ORGANIZATION	, now adds generosity to her justice in the publication of this brief but earnest tribute to their great ability and patriotism .

		The little mountainous country of muw ^ iei ^ * ^ ® `` ^ * `` ^ * ^ * history full of tragedy , war , and romance .

		THE DIAL 323 the original documents for some of the more dis - puted portions of this long stretch of history .

		The first half of his hook sketches the rise and fall of the princely caste in a very condensed form .

		In fact , this part of the volume suffers from too great condensation .

		The reader labors continually under the disadvantage of not knowing enough of the great facts of the period which the writer too often takes for granted as familiar to him .

		The second part of the volume , sketching the rise of a self - educated and self-governing peasantry , does not present the same difficulty for the reader .

		It rounds up the history in a more completed form , and gives a more definite idea of the sequence of events and their relations the one to the other .

		Principal
Rhys of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	has given us our best history of the period of the formation of the Welsh people , and Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	has expounded in detail their early social history .

		Consequently Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- wards has passed lightly over these two themes .

		With the almost necessary condensation of the volume , it nevertheless gives us the best single - volume history of one of the hardiest and most substantial little peoples of the Old World .

		Here a woman , eager for attention and praise , is wedded to a man miserly in his affections .

		A mighty traveller , who has won the plaudits of all
Britain	LOCATION	by his conduct during a ticklish time in
Africa	LOCATION	, returns to civilization and falls desperately in love with the half-neglected wife .

		She plays with fire long enough to be found in his company at a river - aide inn , about to dine with him .

		The discoverer , her brother-in-law , telegraphs the husband .

		Friends of hers arriving just after , the wife returns home , and one of the friends , the peacemaker of the book , dines with the lover instead .

		Then every - one unites to lie the wife out of her scrape , -- some of them men of the utmost probity , who still find it impossible to disclose facts which may have so tragic an ending for so comic an episode .

		The plot is ingenious , the conversation is brilliant with - out being surcharged with impossible epigram , the final curtain is well contrived , and the play is suffi - ciently analytical and involved to make an intellec - tual appeal .

		Its popularity is sufficiently attested by the fact that it held the boards of the Criterion Theatre in
London	LOCATION	for a year or more in 1897-8 , Mr.
Charles Wyndham	PERSON	appearing as the '' peace - maker '' of the cast .

		Still , the work is not in Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's best manner .

		It lacks those Bashes of sat - ire which so brilliantly exposed the weaknesses of the British middle classes , concerning itself only with the follies of the aristocracy .

		It points no moral higher than the inexpediency of being caught , or the expediency of treating one 's wife with due consideration .

		But it is still a great advance on the dramatic work of a generation ago , and brings to the American a sharper realization of the un - fortunate condition of dramatic affairs in his own country .

		Euaysupon Professor
Pasquale ViUari	PERSON	's `` Two Florentine and
First Centuries of Florentine His	ORGANIZATION	- itaiian hutory .

		j. ^ ^ ^ '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- has become so well known since the appearance of the two-volume edition in
1895	DATE	, that an extended review of the work in its new single-volume form is not necessary .

		The present issue of the book hardly attains to the dignity of a second edition .

		The chronicle of the pseudo
Brunetto Latini	PERSON	has been omitted ; other - wise there is no change in the text .

		Page for page , word for word , the matter is the same , even as simple a slip as that on page 158 , where the name of
Frederick I.	PERSON	has crept into the text , obviously in the place of Henry VI. , is retained .

		So also the many offenses of the translator against ordinary English usage , -- conspicuously on the title-page , -- have been left untouched .

		It may be well to repeat , however , this much of what has been said before .

		The book is not a history of
Florence	LOCATION	, as the title might lead one to suppose .

		It is rather a collection of brilliant and valuable essays upon Florentine and Italian institutions that have appeared before in various Italian journals , -- the dates of publica - tion ranging over a period of nearly thirty years .

		The author , however , has never taken the trouble to rewrite these articles in the light of the sub - sequent work of such investigators as
Capponi	LOCATION	,
Hartwig	PERSON	,
Scheffer Birchorst	PERSON	, and others .

		Other than an occasional foot-note , no use has been made of this new material .

C. J. Holmes	PERSON	's volume on Constable .

		As in the preceding volumes , a pleasantly written biog - raphy of the painter , drawn in this case from the inclusive work of
Leslie	PERSON	, precedes an extended crit - ical survey of his work .

		It is unfortunate that Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	should be obliged -- compelled is perhaps the better word -- to defend his painter from the attacks upon his art and method which
Ruskin	PERSON	's enthusiasm for
Turner	ORGANIZATION	caused him to make ; but it is a pious duty , and is well performed .

		The de - light with which Constable 's work was received in
France	LOCATION	long before he had been accorded the praise his genius deserved in his own
England	LOCATION	might have warned Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	against making too much of the state of painting in
Great Britain	LOCATION	at the time , and the cautious reader will receive his dicta on the superiority of British art with some allowances for patriotic fervor .

		But he is right in calling Constable the first of the moderns in landscape , and doubly right in bringing forward proofs of his real veneration and regard for his predecessors , however much he departed from them .

		The book concludes with twenty-four reproductions , in half - tone , of Constable 's most characteristic work .

May 1	DATE	, The life of a holy man of
England	LOCATION	, The life of < '
Monsieur Vincent	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
James Adderley	PERSON	, following the life of St.
Francis	PERSON	by the same author in the '' Lives of Holy Men '' series -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , has less of vital interest than the earlier volume .

		A life given up in great measure to purely administrative details , however fruitful of good and however significant in the development of civilization , does not easily lend itself to the purposes of the story-teller .

		In the opening chap - ter , Mr.
Adderley	PERSON	says : '' We admire the capacity and wonder at the genius of men who are able to conceive and carry out just one piece of work in a lifetime ;
John Howard	PERSON	, the reformer of prisons ;
John Wesley	PERSON	, the popularizer of the Gospel ;
Lord Shaftesbury	PERSON	, the friend of the over-worked women and children ; Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	, the reviver of the belief in Church and Sacraments .

		What are we to think of a single man who combined the work of all these and more besides ? ''

		What St.
Vincent	PERSON	ac - complished in these various directions is told simply , with some little incidental comparison of his methods with the methods of social and relig - ious reformers of our time , and not always to the credit of the latter .

		If Mr.
Adderley	PERSON	errs as a biographer , it is in his uncritical attitude toward his hero , an attitude perhaps made necessary by the narrow limits imposed upon him in compressing so much into so small a book .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The new edition of '' Studies of the Greek Poets , '' by
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, is reprinted unchanged , and means nothing more than that the earlier impression had become exhausted .

		We are glad that the demand for this sterling work requires a new edition every few years , for it is the best book of its kind in the language , and has done incalculable service to students of litera - ture in revealing to them the ethical and aesthetic aspects of Greek poetry .

		It does not say the final word of scholarship upon the subject , but it does have the rare power of arousing interest and enthusiasm .

		There are two volumes , imported by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Three new Baedekers have just been imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The < ``

		Khartoum again takes its place among the towns to be visited , and may be reached by a train de luxe on the Soudan Military Rail - way , The '' Great

BRE	ORGANIZATION	T
HA RTE	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was nearly a quarter of a century ago that
Bret Harte	PERSON	, then close upon forty years of age , received an appointment in the consular service of the
United States	LOCATION	, and went abroad to live .

		He probably had little thought at the time that his self-expatriation would be pro- longed for twenty-four years , and that he would die in a foreign country .

		His first public ser - vice was at Crefeld , but after two years he was transferred to the important consulate at Glas - gow , where he remained until
1886	DATE	, when the spoilsmen demanded his place , and he became a victim of our grotesque national system of consular appointments .

		He found life in
Great Britain	LOCATION	so comfortable that he decided to re - main .

		His reputation as a man of letters was so great that his pen assured him an income for as long as he should be able to use it ; he was , moreover , one of the few American writers of his time who were as popular in
England	LOCATION	as at home .

		He even had a following upon the Continent , especially in
Germany	LOCATION	, and his stories had been translated into many languages .

		So he removed from
Glasgow	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	, made himself a home ia the capital city of our race , and enjoyed life for something over twenty years longer .

		When he died , on the fifth of this month , he was in his sixty-third year .


Bret Harte	PERSON	's reputation as a writer was fully made when he went abroad in the seventies , and it was curiously like the more recent repu - tation of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		In other words , it was based upon a mastery of the short story , upon a gift of vivid realism in the por - trayal of striking types of character found far from the conventional environment of old so - cieties , and upon a knack of easy rhyming of a sort now humorous , now pathetic , which occa - sionally stirred the deeper emotions .

		The things which he could do he had already done , and done inimitably , when he became a volun - tary exile .

		Since then , he has perhaps doubled the volume of his work , but he has added to it no new note , and has remained content to ring the changes upon the old themes and situations .

		It is perhaps the best of all legitimate trib - utes to his great talent , amounting almost to genius , to say that his later stories retain much of the freshness of the earlier ones .

		The vein of Californian romance which he worked so successfully in the seventies , continued in the nineties and beyond to yield ore of rich quality .

		He repeats himself many times , to be sure , but his repetitions are something more than replicas of achieved masterpieces ; they are rather anal - ogous to the variations upon a single theme to which the great composers have devoted their 888 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, best abilities .

		In the cases of the musician and the story-writer alike , the power to charm continuously is the real test , and we do not know why the variations of the artist in words should be treated with a scorn that we would not think of bestowing upon the variations of the artist in tones .


Francis Bret Harte	PERSON	was born in
Albany	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	.

		His father died when the boy was fifteen years old , and the family then migrated to
California	LOCATION	.

		The boy 's early experience in - cluded gold-digging , type-setting , and school - teaching .

		When a compositor at
Eureka	LOCATION	he tried his hand at writing , and the ability thus displayed earned him an editorial position on his newspaper .

		But his zeal outran his dis - cretion , and the office was nearly wrecked in consequence of the young editor 's denunciation of an outrageous Indian massacre in which the leading citizens of the town had taken part .

		He then started '' The Californian '' on his own account , but the paper had only a brief existence , and is chiefly remembered because the '' Condensed Novels '' first appeared in its columns .

		In
1868	DATE	'' The Overland Monthly '' was established , and
Harte	PERSON	was appointed its editor .

		His opportunity was now at hand , and he knew how to make use of it .

		The story of his sudden leap into national fame with '' The Luck of Roaring Camp '' is familiar , and need not be here repeated .

		The reception given it in
California	LOCATION	was decidedly unfavor - able , and many were the denunciations of the author that appeared in the press .

		But the
East	LOCATION	was yet to be heard from ; and when its voice was heard , the local verdict was ab - solutely reversed , for the story was received '' with an enthusiasm that half frightened the author , '' and even `` The Atlantic Monthly '' wrote soliciting a contribution of similar sort .

		Two or three years later ,
Bret Harte	PERSON	left
California	LOCATION	for the East , and established him - self as a journalist and man of letters in con - nection with the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	`` and the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		This is the story of his life up to the time of his consular appointment , and is all that need be here recounted .

		It was a fortunate happening for American literature that he should have passed the receptive years of his life upon the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		Our na - tional history has offered few such opportu - nities for a genial observer , and
Bret Harte	PERSON	was the man for the occasion .

		The exodus of
1849	DATE	was one of the most picturesque things in our annals , and resulted in a social con - dition that remains absolutely unique .

		The author 's own words must here be quoted to help our understanding of the phase of Amer - ican civilization that he has placed permanently upon record . ''

		He must beg the reader to bear in mind that this emigration was either across a continent almost unex - plored , or by the way of a long and dangerous voyage around
Cape Horn	LOCATION	, and that the promised land itself presented the singular spectacle of a patriarchal Latin race who had been left to themselves , forgotten by the world , for nearly three hundred years .

		The faith , courage , vigor , youth , and capacity for adventure neces - sary to this emigration produced a body of men as strongly distinctive as the companions of

		Unlike most pioneers , the majority were men of profession and education ; all were young , and all had staked their future in the enterprise .

		Critics who have taken large and exhaustive views of mankind and society from club windows in Pall Mall or the

San Francisco	LOCATION	in the gala days of her youth , and must read the blazon of their deeds like the doubtful qnarterings of the shield of Amadis de

		The total literary output of this brilliant and accomplished writer includes , besides the sub - stantial collection of his poems , upwards of forty volumes of fiction .

		Perhaps one-fourth of these volumes are single novels ; the others are collections of short stories .


Bret Harte	PERSON	was less successful when working upon a large scale than when he confined himself to a few pages .

		The constructive art , which was almost faultless in his briefer efforts , seemed to fail him when he attempted the form of lengthy narrative , and the most extensive of all his fictions , the story of ''
Gabriel Conroy	PERSON	, '' is among the weakest .

		Of his longer stories , '' The Crusade of the Excelsior '' is probably the best .

		It is as the master of the short story that he will mainly live in the history of our literature , and he is bound to occupy a high position .

		His stories are very uneven in their excellence , as could hardly fail to be the case when it is considered that they must number in the neighborhood of two hundred ; but the best of them , the best fifty of them , let us say , constitute a body of work that must be ranked above nearly everything else of its class in our literature , excepting only as hors concours the work of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	and
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 339 PAUL LEI CEST ER FORD .

		The shocking tragedy which ended the life of
Paul Leicester Ford	ORGANIZATION	on the eighth of this month dealt a serious hlow to hoth American literature and American historical scholarship .

		Born in
1865	DATE	, he had lived among hooks all his life , and had done an amount of literary work that was prodigious for one 80 young .

		On the historical side , his work comprises editions of the works of
Thomas Jeffer	PERSON	- son and
John Dickinson	PERSON	, a valuable critical work upon '' The New England Primer , '' biographies of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	, and many lesser labors in the field of our Colonial and Revolutionary his - tory .

		To the larger public , he is best known as the author of `` The Honorable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	'' and ''
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' besides two or three novels of lighter character .

		The first of these novels , which is one of the strongest works of recent American fiction , had a curious history .

		It came unheralded , and attracted little attention .

		Bat as time went on , its readers told their friends about it , and the demand steadily increased until it became one of the best-selling books upon the market , and con - tinued to be largely purchased for several years .

		In other words , it showed that a good book may achieve popular success in strictly legitimate ways , and its history stands in striking contrast to the history of the average popular novel of the day .

		The art of the advertiser brought immediate suc - cess to ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' which was rather a pity , because a prejudice was thus created against the book in the minds of discriminating observers , and its popularity was made to appear more arti - ficial than deserved .

		As a matter of fact , it was good enough to win its way without being `` boomed '' or '' boosted , '' and stands out among the best recent romances of its class .

		It has the uncommon merit of being based upon a genuinely scholarly know - ledge of its period , without suffering from the obtru - sion of learning , or having its romantic and senti - mental interest in any way impaired .

		THE DETACHED METHOD IN LITERATURE , Perhaps the great French critics are the com - pletest modern examples of personal detachment from literary work ; but English and American students of life have conspicuously tried to escape their native bias .

		To be able to externalize one 's environment , to get an outside view of one 's dog - mas , is deemed so necessary that the first step upon discovering an artistic faculty is to move to a metropolis and view past experiences and present emotions from that vantage-ground .

		Only recently has this been done with conscious eye upon the perspective .

		The blind impulse to get into a larger stream of life used to be the motive ; or the need of a recognition not to be found in provincial society , -- as when Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	made his way to
London	LOCATION	.

		The great Doctor would , indeed , have resented any intimation that he was trying to get away from the moral and intellectual atmosphere in which he was reared .

		His opinion upon '' apostasy , '' as he would have termed it , from one 's education , was very decided .

		As the
Seward	ORGANIZATION	letters report , he professed that '' if he had been educated in the Roman Catholic faith , he would have questioned his right to quit the religion of his fathers . ''

		Stubbornly as he was bent upon adhering to the tenets he was born to , Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	must have suffered intensification or enlargement of ideas by his migration from Lich - field ; and upon the impressionable and vivid mind of Shakespeare the
London	LOCATION	journey doubtless wrought more deeply still .

		It brought to the dramatist that quickening of observation and memory which is so much more to the dramatic than to the philosophic observer of life .

		The details of his
Stratford	LOCATION	impressions must have started out in his mind , sensitivized by exile , fresh and full of color as they rarely appear to the familiar eye .

		Follies , customs , speech , naked human nature , unreflectingly absorbed long before , came out with the enchanting picturesqueness dis - tance lends . ''

		Justice Shallow '' moved across his fellow-townsman 's field of vision , in all the pomp and circumstance of his official position , and withal without the over-emphasis which irritated daily companionship would have given .

		All the tender - ness of years of separation softened the medium through which the observer in city pent surveyed the fair rural
Warwick	PERSON	of his boyhood .


Jane Austen	PERSON	is the only notable instance I can now recall of a dramatic portrayer of contemporary English manners who gives the effect of perspective in her picture , subdues the whole to artistic propor - tions , without effecting this objective treatment by bodily removal from the scenes she depicts .

		The quiet humdrum society in which she lived was irradiated for her by the lambent light of an inex - tinguishable humor .

		The fine delicate touch is that of serene detachment , not too complete and removed for understanding .

		For satirists , such unexaggerated views are not essential .

		One can attack abases from which one saffers acute and present misery , the more fitly and definitely for the pain .

		The caricature derives its ingenious power to torment from the isolation of certain qualities , the bias of the treatment .

		Bat the gentle , mellow outline of nature , the nothing too much , the modelling of a figure without the distortion of dislike or the harshness of incomplete comprehension , is not to be done in the heat of controversy .

		The exquisite grace of a day that is dead may be deplored , but it is the better artistic - ally since it can not come back in its crude emphatic salience .

		Situations may press too close for the play of wit or fancy , but individuality presses closer still , and getting away from that is a far more subtle matter .

		A mind uncolored by habit , preposses - 840 THE DIAL .

		Barns 's `` see oursel ' as ithers see us '' seems to offer a rough-and-ready substitute for the absolute insight .

		The virility that bubbled up so easefuUy in his song would have been ill exchanged for the tact that holds its finger upon the popular pulse .

		Well for us that
Robert Bnrns	PERSON	's nature had its roots too far back in the ploughing , love-making , peasant days of Ayr , to be transplanted into the conventional and artificial methods of the letters of his day .

		If , as Sudermann maintains in his novel '' Es War , '' repentance is an emasculating exercise , destructive of the peace it seeks , surely the effort to view ourselves as others do , -- and that is generally satirically , sometimes despondently , -- can not pro- duce peace of mind .

		The dramatist may find it profitable ; but the lyrical poet , or the man of action , leans for strength upon his subjective energy , and that is as liable to collapse from the intrusion of alien forces as was Lamia 's palpi - tating loveliness .

		Fortunately , the subjective type is usually impervious to the opinions of others .

		If
Napoleon	PERSON	had been as acutely sensitive to public approval as
Josephine	PERSON	was , he would have made but a poor figure in the world .

		Detachment , then , however desirable for critics and dramatists , seems to be in its infancy as a lay endowment , because of its difficulty of attainment .

		Whims and prejudices and personal bias serve their end in urging us toward definite goals , and give color to the material upon which the student of life works .

Earnest	LOCATION	, purposeful , strenuously industrious -- such was the life of the late Sir
James Paget	PERSON	, and we close the book that pictures so faith - fully his long and useful career , with a feeling of gladness that such a man has lived .

		Ever since the appearance of the '' Religio Medici '' a peculiar interest has attached to the self - revelations of a physician .

		Perhaps it is the old conflict between religion and science that is at the bottom of this interest . ''

		Three physicians , two atheists , '' was a saying common in
Browne	PERSON	's day , and is still not without a measure of truth .

		But in Paget the highest scientific attainments were united with the loftiest spiritual faith and the most constant devotion to the claims of religion .

		That in him physic did not crowd out metaphysic may be seen in a brief passage from one of his rou - tine lectures on the functions of the brain .

		`` Other portions of the human mind are the reason , and the conscience ... by which there is established between man and the brutes a great difference , not in degree alone , but in kind .

		The spirit differs from all the faculties in its independence of our organization : for it is exercised best in complete abstraction from all that is sensible ; it is wholly independent of the organi - zation of the brain ; wholly independent also of the education of the understanding . ''

		Even an outline of
Paget	PERSON	's life of ceaseless activity and well-earned honors would more than fill our available space .

		He was born at
Yarmouth	LOCATION	in
1814	DATE	, being one of seventeen children , nine of whom reached maturity , and he had to contend with a lack of means that finally amounted to poverty ; but the young man welcomed each obstacle as an incentive to renewed effort and an earnest of ultimate suc - cess .

		THE DIAL 341 of insolvency against his honored father 's name .

		Some of the achievements of
James Paget	PERSON	's student days at
St. Bartholomew 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	are notable .

		In four or five days he read up medical jurisprudence , and , at the competitive examination , bore off the highest honors in this as well as in his other studies .

		He enjoyed almost a monopoly in his ability to read Ger - man with ease , and found himself in the curious position of tutor to his instructors when medical intelligence from
Germany	LOCATION	was called for .

		Other languages he quickly acquired for pur - poses of his profession .

		A noteworthy per - formance of his still earlier years illustrates his bent for natural science .

		While yet under twenty , he prepared an exhaustive flora --
1185	DATE	plants -- of his native
Yarmouth	LOCATION	, publishing it with an elder brother 's equally careful study of the fauna , and accompanying it with obser - vations on the distribution and modification of species that read like prolegomena to the '' Origin of Species , '' which was still a quarter of a century in the future .

		A valuable contribu - tion to medical science was his discovery , by the aid of a borrowed microscope , of the trichina spiralis , which Professor Virchow has since made the subject of more extended study .

		He found time and means to vary the monotony of his ` prentice days by a three-months visit to
Paris	LOCATION	hospitals and lecture-rooms .

		Writing home , he speaks with extreme disgust of the ruffianly appearance of the unwashed and un - shaven medical students , with their ragged coats and wooden shoes .

		He regrets to see even some of his own countrymen lapsing into a like uncouthness ; '' however , '' he adds , '' I hope a great deal of the worst is to be set down to the Americans , of whom a great many are , I know , studying here . ''

		We hope he was mistaken .

		Surely Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, who studied in
Paris	LOCATION	a few years earlier , gives no such im - pression in his account of
Louis	LOCATION	's '' faithful band of almost worshipping students , '' and in his picture of the knot of Bostonians and
Phila	LOCATION	- delphians that used to breakfast at the
Cafe Procope	LOCATION	, where
Jouffroy	PERSON	and other famous or soon-to-be - famous men also took their morning coffee .

		Another fling at Americans -- and this time at American women -- is found in a letter to Sir
Joseph Hooker	PERSON	on the proposed admission of women-doctors to the
International Medical Congress	ORGANIZATION	held in
London	LOCATION	in
1881	DATE	. ''

		I am influenced towards a negative posture in this case , '' he says , '' by what I have heard of some of the American and
Zurich	LOCATION	women - doctors , whom it would be difficult to exclude , though few decent Englishmen would like to be associated with them . ''

		Such disparaging remarks from one so kindly and charitable and so careful in weighing his words , are the more noteworthy as the utterances of a man who was loaded with honors by American scientific so - cieties and who came to have a wide circle of warm friends in this country .

		Apropos of his friendships , a few of the good things in which the book abounds must find a place here .

		At the dinner following
Paget	PERSON	's delivery of the Hunterian oration before the
College of Surgeons	ORGANIZATION	in
1877	DATE	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, a close friend of his , proposed the orator 's health in a little speech in which he divided mankind into two classes , -- the happy minor - ity who had heard the address , and the to-be - pitied majority who by their fault or misfortune had not .

		`` There is only one way , '' said
Paget	PERSON	in responding to the toast , '' in which it may be possible to surpass Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	as an orator , and that way I will proceed to put in practice .

		You all know that though speech may be silvern , silence is golden .

		You shall have the gold . ''

		Not a few eminent authors and scientists were Sir
James	PERSON	's friends and admir - ers .

		We see him sitting with Romanes on one side and
Browning	PERSON	on the other , laughing with hearty zest at the latter 's story of his faithless Italian maid-servant who pilfered his tea and then , conscience-stricken , stole his candles to burn before a little shrine in expiation of the theft .

		His admiration for
George Eliot	PERSON	and his enjoyment of her novels is in somewhat significant contrast with his difficulty in get - ting through '' Marcella '' one stormy day in the country .

		With
Lowell	PERSON	he was on the friendliest of terms .

		`` They were made for each other , '' says
Paget	PERSON	's son .

		In their hearty liking for the English climate the two were certainly at one .

		As after-dinner speakers they enjoyed a nearly equal repute .

		The late Mr.
Justice Denman	PERSON	said , '' I once heard , at a dinner of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	, the late Lord
Coleridge	PERSON	, Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, then
American Ambas	ORGANIZATION	- sador , Sir
James Paget	PERSON	, and Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	, all speak on the same evening ; and the general opinion put
Lowell	PERSON	first and
Paget	PERSON	next . ''

		A short letter from
Lowell	LOCATION	to
Paget	LOCATION	, not included in Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's collection , is so characteristic in its happy phrasing , and so illustrative of the esteem entertained for Sir James by all who knew him , as to warrant insertion here .

		`` If anything could add to the pleasure of dining with you , it would be that of meeting Lord
Acton	PERSON	.

		He 842 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, is one of the few men I have ever met , the inside of whose head more than keeps the promise of the out and in his case that is saying a great deal .

		I well remember in what terms he spoke of you ; and shall not say whether I agreed with him or not , because my opinion could add no weight to his .

		You see I am wandering from the point -LRB- like every after-dinner speaker but you -RRB- -- but it is only because I would fain put off saying that I am unfortunate enough to be engaged for
Thursday	DATE	.

		I can only say I wish I were n't ! ''

		Our editor has some pleasant things to record of
Lowell	LOCATION	, and collects a number of his wise and witty sayings that have never before been in print .

		A baronetcy was conferred upon Paget in
1871	DATE	, when he had been already thirteen years , in his professional capacity , a member of the queen 's household .

		He died in
1899	DATE	.

		His fame as a physician rests chiefly on his work in surgical pathology , wherein he serves as one of the links connecting the old Hun - terian surgery with that of the
last quarter	DATE	- century .

		His son
Stephen	PERSON	has admirably edited and supplemented his autobiography and let - ters , adding
Millais	PERSON	' portrait of Sir
James	PERSON	and other portraits and illustrations .

		Scant space remains in which to notice the '' Essays and Addresses . ''

		Though almost wholly on medical subjects , many of them hold the lay reader a willing captive by their clear and engaging style .

		Such are , for ex - ample , the chapters on '' Stammering with Other Organs than Those of Speech , '' '' What Becomes of Medical Students , '' '' Theology and Science , '' `` Nervous Mimicry , '' and `` Errors in the Chronometry of Life . ''

		IjIncoliN 's PLiAn of Reconstruction .

		* A whole generation of men has passed from the stage of human affairs since the legal adjustment of conflicting purposes for the reconstruction of
State	ORGANIZATION	governments in the rebellious South ; yet for thirty years such has been the conflict of opinion and the resulting current of events that one may say today with a large measure of truth that the work of Reconstruction is still incomplete .

		Three days before his death Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	said : D '' I have been shown a letter ... in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question whether the seceded • Lincoln 's Plan of Reconstruction .

		By
Charles H. McCarthy	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		States , so called , are in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	or out of it ... As appears to me , that question has not been , nor yet is , a practically material one , and that any discussion of it while it thus remains practically immaterial could have no effect other than the mischievous one of divid - ing our friends .

		As yet , whatever it may hereafter become , that question is bad as the basis of a contro - versy , and good for nothing at all -- a mere pernicious abstraction .

		We all agree that the seceded States , so called , are out of their proper practical relation with the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and that the sole object of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, civil and military , in regard to those States , is to again get them into that proper practical relation .

		I believe that it is not only possible , but , in fact , easier , to do this without deciding or even considering whether these States have ever been out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	than with it .

		Finding themselves safely at home , it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad .

		Let us join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these States and
the Union	ORGANIZATION	, and each forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the States from without into the
Union	LOCATION	, or only gave them proper assistance , they never having been out of it . ''

		Here , in a few sentences , is Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's plan for Reconstruction ; and it may be called the paternal plan .

		Not explicitly , but tacitly and practically , it is based upon the theory for which the war had been undertaken by the North -- that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is perpetual , and that a State may not secede .

		At the same time , it met the protest of such practical minds as that of
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	-- that a State can secede , and that in fact eleven did so act -- by the con - cession that '' the seceded States , so called , are out of their proper and practical relation with the
Union	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The eminently practical mind of the great President recognized what so many of his contemporaries failed to grasp : that polit - ical theories and the actual events of life do not always coincide .


Thomas Williams	PERSON	, of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, well expressed the truth in his remarks in the
House	ORGANIZATION	,
April 29 , 1864	DATE	, when he said that in the minds of the framers of the Constitution the theory of an indissoluble
Union	ORGANIZATION	referred to the right , to its organic law ; but that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	could be ruptured by vio - lence .

		Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	himself , four days later , put it concisely when he said : '' What are we making war upon them for ?

		For seceding ; for going out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	against law .

		The law forbids a man to rob or murder , and yet robbing and murder exist defactOj but not de jure ^ The problem of Reconstruction was there - fore not an easy one ; it was exceedingly diffi - cult to make a harmony of theory and fact .

		On the one hand were the Constitution and the perpetual pact ; on the other were the violated law and the offenders .

		Men like
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 Lincoln and
Stevens	PERSON	, who agreed thoroughly as to the theory of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, fixed their attention , after the event of secession , poles apart .

		Lincoln 's mind was on the indissoluble Union ;
Stevens	PERSON	saw before all else the violat - ors of the law .

		Lincoln 's desire to restore the status quo dwarfed all questions of method ; to
Stevens	PERSON	the status quo was worth restoring only on certain conditions and with certain guarantees for the future .

		The one thought upon the returned and restored prodigal ; the other elaborated pains and penalties .

		If Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's was the paternal plan , that of Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	was the penitentiary one .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	died on the eve of the Recon - struction period , and his successor was soon at war with the leaders of Congressional opinion .

		It has always been an open question to thought - ful men , how far the great leader , if he had lived , would have determined the facts of Keconstruction .

		The issue that was made , early in
1864	DATE	in the first session of the Thirty - eighth
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, when
Henry Winter Davis	ORGANIZATION	and Senator Wade brought in a bill which ignored the administration 's policy of restora - tion in
Louisiana	LOCATION	, foreboded a conflict ; and although it was for the time averted , the desire to punish the rebellious South , and to make sure of the abolition of slavery , was too strong to be permanently set aside .

		Yet one may reasonably cherish the belief that , had the leader lived who far more than any other man concerned with the rebellion commanded the confidence of his fellow-countrymen , some of the harsher features of Reconstruction as car - ried out would have been avoided .

		Whilst it is true that the opposition to Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	was based only partly on his plan , and was directed also at his independence in the initiation of a policy , we can agree with the latest biographer of
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, Congressman
McCall	PERSON	, that if Lincoln had lived '' his fine political sagacity and his popularity with the people might not have been strong enough to carry through his plan of Reconstruction , but we can at least feel sure that his moderation would have averted any serious rupture ; that he would not have been dragged to the bar of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in impeachment proceedings , and that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, under the lead of
Stevens	PERSON	, would not have wielded the supreme power . ''

		Mr.
Charles H. McCarthy	PERSON	has very happily gathered into his volume on '' Lincoln 's Plan of Reconstruction '' the lines of policy that lie about the purpose of President Lincoln .

		In the first four chapters he discusses the admin - istrative efforts to restore to the Union Ten - nessee ,
Lousiana	LOCATION	, and
Arkansas	LOCATION	, and the for - mation of the new State of
West Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Through all these tentative efforts , whether in what was contemptuously called the '' ten per cent '' policy in the three
Southwestern States	LOCATION	, or in the recognition in the '' Old Dominion '' of a minority vote setting free the western por - tion of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	was clear in his own mind .

		What he said in the case of
Virginia	LOCATION	applies to all : '' The consent of the Legislature of
Virginia	LOCATION	is con - stitutionally necessary to the bill for the admission of
West Virginia	LOCATION	becoming a law .

		A body claiming to be such a legislature has given its consent .

		We can not well deny it is such unless we do so upon the outside knowledge that the body was chosen at elections in which a majority of the qualified voters of
Virginia	LOCATION	did not participate .

		But it is a universal practice in the popular elections in all these States to give no legal consideration whatever to those who do not choose to vote , as against the effect of the votes of those who do choose to vote .

		Hence it is not the qualified voters , but the qualified voters who choose to vote , that consti - tute the political power of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Much less than to non-voters should any consideration be given to those who did not vote in this case , because it is also matter of outside knowledge that they are not merely neglectful of their rights under and duty to this govern - ment , but were also engaged in open rebellion against it ... Can this
Government	ORGANIZATION	stand if it indulges con - stitutional constructions by which men in open rebellion against it are to be accounted , man for man , the equals of those who maintain their loyalty to it ? ''

		The sixth chapter , a most instructive one , '' Theories and Plans of Reconstruction , '' pre - sents the President 's plan ,
Sumner	PERSON	's theory of '' State suicide , '' the '' conquered territory '' theory of
Stevens	PERSON	, and the view persistently held by many Northern Democrats that only the final event of the war could determine whether the rebellious States were in or out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The President 's plan assumed not only that the Union was indestructible , but also that individuals rather than States were in rebellion , and that individuals rather than States were to be brought to terms .

		Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	's theory held that the act of the de facto rulers of a
State	ORGANIZATION	is the act of that
State	ORGANIZATION	, and that secession involved '' a practical abdi - cation by
the State	ORGANIZATION	of all rights under the Constitution ... and the
State	ORGANIZATION	being , accord - ing to the language of the law , felo de - se , ceases to exist . ''

		Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	's theory was too much that of a legalist , in some of its features , to be satis - factory to a lover of the Constitution in its spirit as well as its letter .

		< `` Wbo pleads the Constitution against our proposed action ?

		Who says the Constitution must come in , in 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, bar of our action ... The Constitution !

		Our Con - stitution , which you repudiate and trample under foot , forbids it !

		Sir , it is an absurdity .

		There must be a party in court to plead it , and that party , to be entitled to plead it in court , must first acknowledge its suprem - acy , or he has no business to be in court at all ... Those who bring in this plea here , in bar of our action , are the advocates of rebels ; they are speaking for them and not for us -- who are the plaintiffs in this trans - action . ''

		The plaintiffs !

		Never once did the mind of this acute lawyer rise above that narrow con - ception of the constitutional defence of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		To Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, the cause of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was that of a sovereign government and a sov - ereign people , and not of a mere plaintiff at the bar .

		The seventh chapter of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's work deals with '' The Rise of the Congressional Plan , '' and gives in detail the discussions in both houses , during
the first half of 1864	DATE	, of the bill introduced by
Henry Winter Davis	ORGANIZATION	and Senator
Wade	PERSON	.

		This bill , which was vetoed by President Lincoln , repudiated the President 's '' ten per cent '' States and their reconstructed governments , and claimed the right for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	'' to reorganize governments in those States , to impose such conditions as it thinks necessary to secure the permanence of republican government , to refuse to recognize any governments there which do not prohibit slavery forever . ''

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	thought that slavery could be abolished only by an amend - ment to the Constitution , and said : '' This bill and the position of these gentlemen seem to me , in asserting that the insurrectionary States are no longer in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, to make the fatal admission that States , whenever they please , may of their own motion dissolve their connection with the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now , we can not survive that admission , I am convinced . ''

		In the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that met in
December , 1864	DATE	, an attempt was made to revive the
Davis	PERSON	-
Wade bill	PERSON	, with the modification of recognizing the `` ten per cent '' States already organized by the administration .

		This meas - ure was unsuccessful ; and equally so was an attempt by the friends of the administration to have the State of
Louisiana	LOCATION	recognized inde - pendently of a general Reconstruction measure .

		There was a drawn battle , at the close of which the President 's death changed the whole situa - tion .

		This conflict of forces within the triumph - ant Republican party is fully presented in the eighth , ninth , and tenth chapters ; while the final chapter notes the '' Culmination of the Presidential Plan '' in the application of it by his successor , and to final discomfiture at the hands of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this chapter the author for the first time becomes something more than a narrator , and enters into a critical examina - tion as to the modes of initiating Reconstruc - tion , the character of the reconstructed govern - ments , and the limitations of the Presidential plan .

		He finds four modes of instituting the renewed governments : by a movement originat - ing with the loyal people , as in
West Virginia	LOCATION	j by Presidential initiative , as in
Tennessee	LOCATION	,
Arkansas	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	; by the expiring power of the
Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	's local governors , as in
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, and
Texas	LOCATION	; and by Congressional authority , as finally in all the eleven States except
West Virginia	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		All of these methods are charac - terized as irregular , but the last is approved as least open to objection .

		The author 's closing remarks may well be quoted : '' However crude we may now consider Mr.
Lin	PERSON	- coln 's system , it should not be forgotten that with hin '' the paramount consideration was the overthrow of the Confederacy .

		With that purpose all his measures har - monized , and it is scarcely critical to examine them from any other point of view .

		How far necessity , which had originally suggested , would subsequently have modified his plan , it is now impossible to state .

		Without detracting a particle from his well-won fame it may be admitted that his method , which could not have foreseen the rapid succession of changes following his death , was but indifferently adapted to solve the problem with which
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was compelled to deal in
1867	DATE	; but the measure of permanent success which attended the deliberate legislation of that body by no means justified the conclusion that some other system would have proved a total failure .

		With all its imma - turity , the plan of the President was not without its advantages .

		It aimed to restore , with as little innova - tion as possible , the Union of the Fathers ; with some exceptions the natural leaders of Southern society were to participate in the work of reorganization ; and the author of this simple plan approached his difficult task in a generous and enlightened spirit . ''

		The substance of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's book is better than his method .

		There is at times a lack of continuity , and a returning upon itself of the narrative which makes it difficult to see the relation of events .

		Especially in the case of the States restored by the President , is it difficult to get the calendar of the story .

		The narrative in
Arkansas	LOCATION	proceeds to
May , 1861	DATE	; then falls back , without notice , to
February	DATE	; then goes on in
May	DATE	.

		Mr.
Pierpont	PERSON	is elected Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	for a term beginning
January 1 , 1864	DATE	, and immediately in his mes - sage makes a recommendation which is acted on by the Legislature

		THE DIAL 345 any disturbance of existing conditions . ''

		On page 203 there is an unprofitable attempt to prove that Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	was in the wrong in considering that James the Second demitted the English crown by abdication .

		On page 434 we are told that '' when the last of the Federal soldiers had set their faces toward the sea , the city of
Atlanta	LOCATION	was little more than a mass of smoking ruins . ''

		In his '' Memoirs , '' General
Sherman	PERSON	says that the fire which Colonel
Roe	PERSON	, by his orders , had set to the rail - road shops , through an explosion '' also reached the block of stores near the depot , and the heart of the city was in flames , but the fire did not reach the parts of
Atlanta	LOCATION	where the courthouse was , or the great mass of dwelling - houses . ''

		The annexed correspondence shows that the intention was merely to destroy that portion of the city which was a fortified place and an arsenal of supplies .

		Old residents tell the same story to those who visit
Atlanta	LOCATION	to-day .

		The author has esteemed too lightly his func - tion as critic .

		One feels that the opposing plans represented by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, by Henry Win - ter
Davis	PERSON	, and by
Stevens	PERSON	, are not sufficiently characterized ; and he gets a less clear view of their constitutional relationships from this work devoted to a single topic than from such a treatise as
McCall	PERSON	's
Life of Stevens	ORGANIZATION	, to which Reconstruction is only a part of the story .


John J. Halsey	PERSON	.

		An
American Translation of Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The late
Eugene Schuyler	PERSON	rather wickedly remarked concerning
Longfellow	PERSON	's translation of Dante : '' You can not possibly understand it unless you have read the original . ''

		This jibe is somewhat less injurious than it sounds , for it is in a measure true of all verse transla - tions of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, among which
Longfellow	PERSON	's is not the least intelligible .

		What makes verse translations , with a few shining exceptions , so disappointing is the fact that their form natur - ally arouses an expectation which is sadly dis - appointed .

		Except as a vehicle for poetry , what excuse for being has verse ?

		The function of a verse translation should be to give some im - pression of the artistic form of the original , some touch of its animating principle , to make a similar appeal to the sense of beauty .

		If a metrical version fails to give such an impres - * The

Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		Revised edition .

		In three volumes :

Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		sion , to make such an appeal , it is like salt that has lost its savor .

		From a prose translation of a poem less is expected : it serves its humble purpose if it afford an accurate and spirited rendering of so much of the meaning of the original as may still persist after the disinte - gration of the poem as a work of art .

		Thi '' residue chances to be , in the case of the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, of weight and value ; moreover , the difficulties in the way of the modern reader who would feel the full glory and divineness of the poem are so great that a faithful transla - tion is not to be despised .

		Even the Italians have their prose version , printed face to face with the original , nor do they shame to con - sult it .

		Similar apparatus is provided by the editors of the well-known '' Temple Classics , ' ^ who give us the fine prose translations of the Inferno by Dr.
Carlyle	PERSON	, of the Purgatorio by Mr.
Okey	PERSON	, of the Paradiso by Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	, in compact and attractive form face to face with the original text .

		The object of this edi - tion is plainly to facilitate the study of the original .

		In a note appended to his translation Mr.
Okey	PERSON	remarks with truth and point : '' Of the supreme poets none loses so much by trans - lation as
Dante	LOCATION	; none so quickly repays a study of the original text .

		Many passages indeed are clearer in Italian than in English . ''

		This should not be forgotten when Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's fling at
Longfellow	LOCATION	is recalled .

		The three translations issued in the '' Tem - ple Classics '' have high and various merits ; still , the very fact that they are by different men deprives them of that uniformity of tex - ture and tone that marks the work of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is pleasant to know that there is a complete translation by an honored American scholar the merits of which are incontestible , perhaps incomparable .

		When Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	first published his prose translation of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in
1891	DATE	, its excellence was widely rec - ognized , -- so widely that a dozen reprints of at least one part of it were called for within a decade .

		Last autumn Professor
Norton	PERSON	com - pleted a thorough-going revision of his great work , which now comes to us in its definitive form from the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		A critical comparison of this with the earlier version is necessary in order to enable one to realize the significance of the author 's quiet statement that he has '' given , perhaps , as much time to the revision as to the original making of the translation . ''

		Indeed , the alterations , both in sense and syntax , are so many and often so radical , that the revision is essentially a new 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, version .

		The changes fall into two classes : those whose purpose was to make the style more flowing and the diction more idiomatic ; and those by which the author seeks to render
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's thought with increased precision and deeper fidelity .

		It is safe to assert that the translator has taken cognizance of the textual corrections and the happier interpretations of recent decades , and that nothing is here set down at random .

		Inasmuch , however , as the former version was also deeply considered , it remains true that the changes in the sense are often of a kind to invite the famous verdict of
Sir Roger De Coverley	ORGANIZATION	.

		They represent the deliberate interpretations of Professor
Norton	PERSON	to-day as opposed to the interpretations of the same authority a dozen years ago .

		It is but natural that there should be instances in the case of which some will prefer the earlier read - ing .

		The very first sentence of the poem af - fords a case in point .

		The earlier version was : '' Midway upon the road of our life I found myself within a dark wood , for the right way had been missed . ''

		The following is the revised version , with the changes made noticeable by italics : '' Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself in a dark wood , where the right way was lost . ''

		Far the most important of the above altera - tions is the change oifor to where .

		The change represents a fundamentally different conception of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's moral and theological attitude .

		Formerly the translator made
Dante	PERSON	say that a man deviates from the straight and narrow way because of an inward declension , a spiritual blindness , which is symbolized by the slumber that possessed him when he '' abandoned the true way . ''

		Now , on the other hand , the trans - lator makes
Dante	ORGANIZATION	imply that a man goes astray morally by reason of mere outward temptations and obstacles .

		Perhaps he is right about
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's attitude ;
Scartazzini	PERSON	does not think so ; others do not think so ; and , however it may be , the change seems to involve some sacri - fice of spiritual significance , of universal truth .

		Whatever one may think of this or that change in the reading , everyone must admire the literary skill displayed in the changes in diction and word-order .

		Professor
Norton	PERSON	's diction bears witness to a taste more nearly faultless than is exhibited by other translators of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		The notes , which in the former version were too scanty , have been increased in number many-fold , and now give a succinct explanation , whenever the explanation is known , of every obscure passage or allusion .

		Detailed comparison of this translation with
Carlyle	PERSON	's of the Inferno or with Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	's of the Paradiso tends to deepen one 's admiration of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's work .

		The American translation is somewhat severer in style than the others , frequently exhibiting a distinct preference for significant Latinisms in
Dante	LOCATION	's diction for which the English translators prefer the more vivid purely English synonyms .

		Not that Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's translation is unduly Latinized ; on the contrary , it is extremely idiomatic , and more so in the present than in the former ver - sion .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	further shows the purity of his taste in eschewing archaisms , except per - haps when the language of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is distinctly scriptural ; and in the avoidance of metrical effects .

		In Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	's charming and spirited version of the Paradiso the light - winged prose is continually hovering on the verge of verse -- sometimes sliding into it .

		It may be questioned whether there is not some element of the meretricious in such a confusion of the two harmonies of prose and of verse .

		The superiority of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's taste is decisively revealed in the uniformity of tone which is preserved throughout : the tone and the har - mony of noble modern prose .

		It is unfortunate that there is no space here for examples which would give point to these observations .

		The reviewer can only record his own conclusion that no other version of the whole poem known to him , and no other combination of versions of the three several parts , can be said to equal Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's in the application of the higher qualities of taste and style to the faithful ren - dition of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's thought in prose .

		In its union of the prime qualities of fidelity and idiomatic felicity , this masterly translation is probably unrivalled .

		No doubt it will have a permanent place as an English classic .


Melville B. Anderson	PERSON	.

		An Explanation op
Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		* In the examination of a biographical work on so important a historical character as Robes - pierre , three questions at once present them - selves : Have new sources or material been discovered ?

		Have the old and well-known sources been correctly used ?

		Is there merit shown in analysis and in literary presentation ?

		In the present volume the first of these may be dismissed at once , for Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	prefaces *
Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		A Study .

		By
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	With portrait .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	' a Sons .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 his work with a disclaimer .

		It is his belief that there is greater need of intelligent study of materials already within reach than of search for altogether new light .

		In recognition of this need he has undertaken the present study .

		The result of his labor is a volume that bears on its every page evidence of that conscientious care and analysis which were , in the writer 's mind , the first essentials .

		Now when a man of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's known ability and honesty of purpose essays such an important examination as this one , and when its perusal shows such extreme care , there is surely reason for the prediction that , in so far as the facts of history are concerned , a just discrimination in the use of materials may be expected .

		It is only in part , however , that such a prediction is verified .

		It would perhaps be hypercritical to attack the author 's old-time presentation of the Kevolution as a sudden emergence and as a series of cataclysms , -- as when , writing of the results of the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, it is stated that '' it was in the na - ture of this crisis that the immediate past fell out of sight altogether .

		There stood between '89 and '90 the strange barrier between sleep and waking . ''

		Such misstatements may be pardoned in the exigencies of dramatic analysis .

		But it is otherwise when materials are avowedly accepted as authoritative which lack the first requisites of true sources .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's ac - count of
Robespierre	LOCATION	's youth and early man - hood is founded upon the memoirs of
Charlotte Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		He not only accepts them as genuine , but , basing an analysis of character upon the sister 's description , he makes that analysis the centre and crux of the later de - velopment of his hero .

		The trustworthiness of these memoirs is then a question of prime importance , yet they have usually been regarded as a forgery .

		The author asserts their authen - ticity , and has made a clever argument in sup - port of his contention .

		Yet , admitting this argument to be convincing and final , the mem - oirs do not constitute a reliable source .

		It is at least clear that they were written years after the events they purport to narrate , that they were amplified by Laperronaye in such a man - ner as to render it impossible to distinguish between original and alterations , and that , at the best , they constitute a solitary , isolated statement of facts unsupported by other wit - nesses .

		To accept such material as a final source is to discredit that modern school of scientific history to which Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's country - men have contributed so largely .

		Along the same lines is the author 's assump - tion of
Robespierre	LOCATION	's unimportance in the sum - mer of
1789	DATE	, because '' for months the half ofiicial Moniteur does not mention his name . ''

		This mistake has become almost a classic .

		The Moniteur in fact did not begin publication until
November of 1789	DATE	, and it was not until years had elapsed that the earlier numbers , dating from
May	DATE	, were published in order to make the file complete for so interesting a period of history .

		Necessarily , citations from the
Moni	PERSON	- teur for this period have no true historical value .

		In minor matters there are occasional errors in the statement of events of importance .

		The
Berlin	LOCATION	treaty of
February , 1792	DATE	, between
Austria	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	, was certainly not due primarily to the intrigues of Catherine II .

		of
Russia	LOCATION	, but was rather the completion of a diplomatic reversal begun in the
Vienna	LOCATION	Con - vention of the previous year , by which
Leo	PERSON	- pold II .

		gained a friend in the king of
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		Both
Van Sybel	ORGANIZATION	and
Sorel	PERSON	have proved this beyond question .

		Nor is that view correct which shows the Girondists in
July of 1792	DATE	as imbued with a great idea , '' the vision of a free world . ''

		The famous decree offering aid to '' nations in bondage '' was not passed until
November	DATE	of that year , and then only by acci - dent , and with no conception of its real import .

		When , however , we turn to the question of analysis and literary presentation , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's work at once takes rank with the best historical essays .

		Granting him his premises , his characterizations of
Robespierre	LOCATION	and of contemporary events are altogether logical , and are presented in a style that forces an absorbed attention .


Robespierre	LOCATION	, as the author sees him , belonged to that class of country lawyers who , imbued with the spirit of anti-revolutionary philosophy , systematized that philosophy into a code of principles , and , with a hard logic , judged all men and events by its formulas . ''

		He took the first postulates of the ' Contrat Social ' for granted ... He deduced from them , and still deduced , with a fatal accuracy of process , with a fatal ignorance of things , and with no appreciation of the increasing chances of error , until his deductions had departed prodigiously from their starting point , and began to prove themselves in every practical applica - tion absurd . ''

		Thus the atmosphere in which
Robespierre	LOCATION	lived was one of political dogmatism .

		He was one of those fanatics who '' Attach themselves to some principle which is either highly probable , or generally acceptable , or even self - evident , and armed with this truth which few care -LRB- and sometimes none are able -RRB- to deny , they proceed to a 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, thousand applications of their rule which they lay down as an iron standard , crushing the multiple irregu - larities of living things .

		Of these it has been well said that they go to the devil by logic . ''

		Imbued with these circumscribed ideals ,
Robespierre	LOCATION	entered the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of
1789	DATE	.

		He was '' unreasonable logic incar - nate , '' yet his reputation grew steadily by his pertinacity in criticism of existing forms , and his insistent postulation of new principles of government .

		At the same time he took no part in the immediate quarrels of the Assem - bly , nor in its practical labors .

		He '' lived in ideas rather than in their application , '' and was in truth incapable of sharing in the popu - lar excitement and enthusiasm of
1789	DATE	.

		This aloofness of temperament , combined with a recognized sincerity , both constantly displayed in the Assembly and at the
Jacobin Club	ORGANIZATION	, served in time to give him a far-reaching influence .

		In popular estimation he personi - fied those principles which the radical revolu - tionists were struggling to realize .

		But with the events of the 10th of
August	DATE	, the people , whose rights
Robespierre	LOCATION	had been preaching , actually acquired power , and a change of role was imperative .

		Obliged to abandon obstruct - ive criticism , his true forte , he entered upon a period of constructive activity , in which he forfeited both the source of his popularity and his political independence .

		Though not the coward he has frequently been pictured , he was never a leader in action , nor strong in times of crisis .

		He unconsciously undermined his own influence by yielding principles to political necessity or to personal ambition .

		In the trial of the
King	PERSON	, his logic became sophistry ; in the attack upon the Girondists he exhibited none but the politician 's tactics .

		Yet with the overthrow of the Girondists the time finally arrived when
Robespierre	LOCATION	's ideals were to be put in execution , when his essays were to become codes .

		This interpretation of
Robespierre	LOCATION	by Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, as just summarized , does not differ greatly from that commonly given .

		It is with the period following
Robespierre	LOCATION	's entrance into the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	that the biography diverges from the beaten track .

		He joined the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, says Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, not reluctantly , but of set purpose .

		He passed from the realm of abstract theory to that of practical politics .

		More and more he sacrificed principles to the gratification of personal am - bition , and he knew himself to have deserted his ideals .

		Opposed in theory to the system of the Terror , he yet submitted to it to retain his leadership in
Paris	LOCATION	, while his occasional resist - ance to that system is explained as the result of a desire to exhibit his authority .

		Finally he was tempted , -- tempted by the vision of despotic authority , only transparently masked by a pretense of moderating the Terror ; and he knew his temptation , yet yielded .

		Such an analysis denies to
Robespierre	LOCATION	the excuse of self-deception : an extreme view , yet one ably argued .

		It seems reasonable also to the reader , and thus is evidence of the skill with which the author has combined his materials .

		It can - not be accepted as conclusive , simply because no dictum on
Robespierre	LOCATION	is conclusive .

		As Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	himself states , '' in every attempt to explain the man , one must omit the back - ground . ''

		In a greater degree than with any other man of the revolutionary era , contempo - rary events fail to illuminate his character .

		The study of
Robespierre	LOCATION	is the study of '' a mind isolated and feeding inwardly upon itself . ''

		In his preface Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	writes : '' Nothing would be easier than to make a drama of the life of
Robespierre	LOCATION	, were one content to neglect the exactitude of historical record , Ou the other hand , nothing would be easier ... than to write down a voluminous chronicle in which the self contradictions should be stated , but not explained , and in which all the sequence of the great story and all its poignancy should be neglected . ''

		Having denied himself the '' easier task , '' Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	undertook to steer the much more diffi - cult middle course , and explain the man .

		To do this successfully and present to the public a study which altogether escapes the imputation of the dry-as-dust accounts on the one hand , and also of the luridly painted theatrical effects on the other , has been Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's work .

		And it is no small praise to say that his explanation of
Robespierre	LOCATION	, while not forfeiting its claim to an honorable place among historical studies , has also much of the charm and style and finish which should win recognition for it in a wider field .

Far East	LOCATION	.

		* Passing over the matter of racial bias , and of the insuperable British belief in the right of Anglo-Saxon nations to subjugate and domi - nate weaker peoples , it may be said that few students of contemporary diplomacy are better qualified to speak of the events that are so rapidly transforming the Orient and opening for us a new chapter in the history of the * The Mastery of thk
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		By
Archibald R. Colquhoun	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: The
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 world than Mr ,
Archibald R. Colquhoun	PERSON	, author of `` The Mastery of the
Pacific	LOCATION	. ''

		Long a resident and traveller in foreign lands , he has enjoyed rare opportunities for observing the peoples of the Far East and noting such social and political institutions as are calculated to throw light on their racial traits as well as on their capacity for self-government .

		Former deputy commissioner of
Burma	LOCATION	and admin - istrator of
Mashonaland	LOCATION	, he was for several years a special correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' in the Orient , -- positions that gave him access to sources of information seldom exploited by Europeans .

		Notwithstanding the fact that he has already published some of these impressions in former volumes which have not only aroused wide interest but won for him special recognition from the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the present book is in every sense a new and original production .

		Its dominant idea appears to be that the
Pacific	LOCATION	is to become the highway for the commerce of the world , and hence the arena for the inter - national rivalries of the dawning century .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's style is at once clear and graphic , while his description of Asiatic conditions and possibilities is both thorough and comprehen - sive .

		The numerous sketches and photographs , which add so much to the interest and value of the book , were made by Mrs.
Colquhoun	PERSON	, the constant companion of her husband throughout his journeys .

		There are also several good maps and a copious index .

		The introductory pages of the volume are devoted to the history of the
Pacific	LOCATION	and of the various races that have made their homes along its coasts and in its countless islands ; while succeeding chapters give a more or less com - prehensive account of the three chief colonial interests in the Orient , -- namely , those of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	, -- and of the empire of
Japan	LOCATION	, with its colony of
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then follows a glance at the interests of other Powers in Asiatic waters , -- the first place being assigned to
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, not only on account of their insular possessions , but also by reason of their even more extensive interests on the mainland .

		Finally comes a rough survey of the possessions of
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	; and the book concludes with a brief presentation of Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's views regard - ing the probable trend of future events in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Convinced that the struggle for supremacy must inevitably be settled by force , and therefore fought out by
Russia	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	because of their proximity to bases of supplies , he is disposed to believe that the impending conflict , though perhaps a bloodless one , is to be shifted to an ocean sphere .

		Hence the Mastery of the
Pacific	LOCATION	is to be decided by the
Great Sea Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		American readers will naturally turn with keenest interest to those pages of Mr.
Colqu	PERSON	- houn 's work which set forth our own interests in the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Thoroughly familiar with the political situation both in this country and in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, he balances the varying forces that are thrusting us further and further into the vortex of international passions , and draws conclusions that ought to receive the careful attention of our statesmen as well as of all citizens who can rise above party and creed .

		To many readers Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's remarks concerning the religion of the Filipino will come in the nature of a revelation . ''

		His Christianity , '' the author declares , '' is a thing about which his best friends disagree .

		Some say it is deep and sincere , others that it is a mere matter of outward show and superstition .

		One of themselves makes the distinction that it is not 80 much religious as fanatical . ''

		While convinced that we are only on the threshold , so to speak , of the difficulties that await us in the
Far East	LOCATION	, Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	thinks that , in spite of many mistakes , we have already accom - plished a great deal .

		And , like most other Englishmen who so complacently view our un - joyous outing in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, he extols the sa - lubrity of the atmosphere , the picturesqueness of the scenery , and counsels us to keep up our present diet and exercise .

		Should we cease finding game in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, there is always the prospect of a bear-hunt in
India	LOCATION	.

		He de - plores the employment of colored troops in subjugating the native population , urges the adoption of an efficient plan of civil service , and expresses the hope that our government will not be hostile either to the institutions of the islanders or to the capital of Europeans .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	observes that what is now wanted is , '' not further statements as to the actual number of pagans in certain districts , or the percentage of immorality among the Friars , but experience and judgment in dealing with matters as they stand at present .

		All the information which can be had by cross-examin - ing untruthful witnesses has been already col - lected , and the bones of the discussion are picked bare . ''

		In other words ,
America	LOCATION	must make up her mind as to her future relations to the
Archipelago	LOCATION	and then '' put her faith in the men who have already devoted so much of their 850 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, time to the problem . ''

		To send another com - mission would , in his opinion , merely result in increasing the number of smatterers .

		Judge
Taft	PERSON	he regards as being thoroughly capable of facing the situation , provided he is supported at home .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	believes that our ideal policy in the
Philippines	LOCATION	would have been a temporary military occupation followed by a gradually-developed civil administration ; but since , out of deference to public opinion in the
United States	LOCATION	, a system of quasi-independence has been inaugurated , he throws out the char - acteristic suggestion that our government ought to '' interfere as little as possible with the cus - toms , prejudices , and religion of the Filipinos , and to keep a tight hold . ''

		Of the various rival powers in the
Far East	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	, according to Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	, will be the dominant factor in the Mastery of the
Pacific	LOCATION	; and this opinion is based in large measure on our vast resources and fast-increas - ing population .

		But he points out very forcibly , in his concluding paragraphs , that in thus em - barking on this new phase of her career our country must be prepared to make certain sac - rifices as well as to remodel not a few of her time-honored institutions .

		In other words , '' there can be no rest , no pause , in the march of a great empire ; it must advance or decay , -- history has made that plain . ''

		Briefs on New Books .

		The completion of Mr.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	's gr ^ iiopedZ S ^ ^ ^ ^ '' Cyclopedia of American Hor - ticulture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deserves special notice .

		At first the work was planned to be a three-volume cyclopedia , but before the first volume was half written it was found that four vol - umes would be necessary .

		As Professor
Bailey	PERSON	says , '' the article Asparagics is the first that began to feel the fuller and larger treatment . ''

		The editor expresses the hope that this cyclopedia will never be revised , since its purpose is to make a record of North American horticulture as it exists at the opening of the twentieth century .

		It is expected that subsequent progress will be recorded in a series of supplements , with cumulative index , the manu - script for the first two of which is already prepared .

		This work has already been somewhat fully re - viewed in The Dial , but its important features as a whole , that serve to distinguish it from other works of the same class , may be re-stated briefly : It represents a living horticulture , rather than a compilation of species that chance to have been de .

		scribed or pictured in other cyclopedias or in peri .

		odical publications .

		In it are found only those species known to be actually in cultivation in this country at the time of publication .

		The second feature is that the species are compared and con - trasted as well as described .

		No cyclopedia has such keys to enable the reader to name the species he has in hand .

		A third feature is that the leading articles are all signed .

		One can tell the source of information ; and while the great number of con - tributors , reaching more than 450 , has resulted in a somewhat heterogeneous work , there is a person - ality in the articles , representing as they do a wide range of experience and attainment , that is far more satisfactory than the cnt-and-trimmed style of the ordinary cyclopedia .

		The fourth feature of the book is that it is primarily a cyclopedia of horti - culture rather than of gardening ; and one more worthy of mention is that plants are presented as living and growing things that are still undergoing evolution .

		This has introduced the historical method of treatment ; and although the subject is a vast one for detailed presentation , the intelligent reader feels the drift of an evolutionary motive .

		Aside from these general features , an entirely new set of excellent horticultural pictures , the biographies of persons who have had an important influence upon American horticulture , the geographical and his - torical subjects , the special attention given to trop - ical and sub-tropical plants , the unusual number of citations to literature , are all worthy of commen - dation .

		Some of the interesting statistics of the work may be mentioned .

		There are
4357	DATE	entries or articles , including cross-references ; the number of genera described is 2225 ; the number of species fully described is 8793 , of which
2419	DATE	are native to
North America	LOCATION	north of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Writing on the cyclopedia was begun in
January , 1899	DATE	, a year having then been spent in making indexes and col - lecting data .

		The proof of the letter Z was received
December 31 , 1901	DATE	.

		In dismissing the work , the editor , in a very characteristic vein , writes as fol - lows : '' Hundreds of books had become familiar friends .

		We would never see them all together again .

		Like a child , the cyclopedia had grown .

		Like the mature youth , it had left us .

		It was no longer ours . ''

		Theories 0 / ^ * '' * ^ * ^ '
Dabney	PERSON	is the latest of the noiafion of theorists regarding the notation of English verse .

		English verse , and , like his prede - cessors , he believes he has solved the multiform problem it presents in '' The
Musical Basis of Verse	ORGANIZATION	, a Scientific Study of the Principles of Poetic Composition '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		All English poetry , the book observes , follows in detail the laws of musical composition , and may be noted musically in either two-four or three-four time .

		Being purely a question of stressed syllables regularly recurring , with either one or two unstressed syllables inter - vening , the division can be made with exactitude , all of the measures variously known as iambic , trochaic , or spondaic falling into the two-four bar ,
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 and those either dactylic , amphibrachic , or ana - paestic into the three-four .

		The author further reduces all forms of English metre to three classes or manners : -LRB- 1 -RRB- , `` Strict , '' in which all the lines begin uniformly with the anacrusis , which will include iambs , anapaests , and amphibrachs ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- , those '' with direct attack , '' without the anacrusis , comprising dactyls and trochees ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- , `` Free , '' in which the poet uses lines with or without the anacrusis .

		As in the case of his predecessors in this field , Mr.
Dabney	PERSON	finds it necessary to accuse poets of eminence of lack of ear for writing verses which do not fall within his scheme , -- Words - worth and
Emerson	PERSON	among others .

		The question of extra syllables is met by putting in extra notes -- not grace notes , either -- as in the case of Milton 's '' Wallowing unwieldy , enormous in their gait , '' where the first bar has four notes and the second three .

		It is
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's method carried to its logical conclusion ; but it does not bring conviction in its train .

		There is a law , exceedingly complex in its statement , which governs English heroic verse .

		It implies not merely stresses in due place , but stresses out of place , the use of long syllables to produce such effects , the various placings of the caesura , and the use of rhetorical pauses for this purpose .

		It also implies elisions , the uses of phrases as long words , and all the delicate shades of stress which long words and phrases so used necessitate .

		Its infinite varieties can not be stated in terms of the metronome , as Mr.
Dabney	PERSON	insists ; and he leaves the problem quite as complicated as he finds it .

		To the classicist , indeed , his book will seem like the reduction of
Lanier	PERSON	's work to an absurdity .

		^ ^ ^ ^ who have played a large part m Amer - ican history , called the '' Riverside Biographical Series '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are of value and interest , since they are not only good pieces of work , but treat of men whose lives are among ordinary readers largely a matter of tradition .

		Mr.
William Garrott Brown	PERSON	has given the life-story of
Stephen Arnold Douglas	PERSON	with a completeness that seems remarkable until one remembers the meteoric brevity of that astonishing career and the over - shadowing importance of the one great question that roused the passion and filled the attention of the country during the decade before the Civil War .

		Few parallels can be found to the astonishing rise to prominence of this man whose body was so small but whose ambition was so colossal .

		There was no situation that he did not dominate at once , whether in frontier
Illinois	LOCATION	or at the capital of the nation , until he found himself confronted by the aroused moral sense of the North .

		Then his essen - tial weakness was manifested .

		Wholly unlike Lin - coln , his beaten rival all through life up to this time , he lacked in moral sensibility .

		He could not measure this new force , because he could not understand it .

		So he failed of the presidency , the goal of his ambition ; and when he died , at forty - eight , he had been pushed to one side by his less brilliant but far greater rival .

		The volume will appeal most to those who are already familiar with the history of
Douglas	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		-- The other volume is a life of
Samuel de Champlain	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Henry D. Sedgwick	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Here , too , one purpose dominated the life of the subject , so that , although the life 's activity extended over nearly half a century , it can be adequately presented in a small compass .

		The author has shown his hero as a statesman and a prudent leader of men , as well as a daring explorer .

		His final word is this : ''
Champlain	PERSON	was very noble in public and private life , simple , just , honorable , and kind , with a tenderness toward the weak , and a steadfast , patient loyalty in trouble , that with his * insuppressive mettle ' make him one of the worth - iest , if not the worthiest , man in the early history of
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		Mediceval ivory carvings .

		The second volume in the series of `` Handbooks of Great Craftsmen '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is curiously misnamed '' The Ivory Workers of the Middle Ages , '' and is certainly misplaced in a series of books having to do with the great craftsmen .

		The human interest is conspicuously lacking .

		The author , Mr.
A. M. Cust	PERSON	, manages to avoid giving any information whatever regarding ivory workers .

		Tuotilo , the monk of
St. Gall	ORGANIZATION	, and a reputed hero of the craft -LCB- circa 900 A.D. -RRB- , is mentioned only for the pur - pose of denying that he was an eminent craftsman in ivory .

		If it be true , as other monographs upon ivory carving state , that
Albrecht Durer	PERSON	,
Michel Angelo	PERSON	,
Benvenuto Cellini	PERSON	, and many other artists and many European princes of the Middle Ages , followed the '' beautiful craft , '' and furnished specimens of their workmanship in ivory to enrich the museums of the art capitals of
Europe	LOCATION	, no men - tion thereof is made in this book .

		Some informa - tion it gives regarding the art of ivory carving in its relation to sculpture , and it seeks to show the continuity of this art from the time of the
Cave Dwellers	ORGANIZATION	down through the various periods into which the history of art is divided , and that it prospered at times when the sculptor 's art declined and when monumental sculpture was almost com - pletely suspended .

		All this is interesting ; but the photographic reproductions by which the book is illustrated do not exhibit the anonymous mediaeval carvers as accurate interpreters of the human form , nor their skill as superior to that of the modern ivory workers .

		Nor are the pictures calculated to inspire the readers of the book with a very deep interest in the art of ivory carving .

		Biblical and ^ ^ ^ cent volumc of the `` Yale Bi - Semiiic studies Centennial Publications '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		jg j ^ ^ g ^ ^ p ^ j ^ j ^ ^ collection of '' Bib - lical and Semitic Studies '' prepared by seven members of the biblical and Semitic faculty of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essays deal with a wide range of 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, topics , touching the Old and New Testaments ,
Rab	PERSON	- binical lore , and Semitic history .

		They are up-to - date discussions , and reflect the spirit of investiga - tion that properly has its abode in such an institu - tion as
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first article , by Professor
E. L. Curtis	PERSON	, is a study of the tribes of
Israel	LOCATION	, in the light of the latest hypotheses put forth by a num - ber of Old Testament scholars , especially in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The impression produced on the reader by a careful perusal of this article is that we are in danger of falling into a habit of employing fanciful and arbi - trary methods in the interpretation of ancient ori - ental literature .

		There is no limit to the possibilities of such imaginary explanations as he gives of the personages of the Old Testament .

		The growth of Israelitish law is the theme of the second article .

		As in much of the current discussions of that sub - ject , the authors .

		Professors
Kent and Sanders	PERSON	, present an argument for the chief growth of the law late in Hebrew history -- in post-exilic times .

		To a layman in the subject , their method of pre - sentation is orderly , consecutive , logical , but rather too much wedded to a theory that underlies the whole scheme to carry conviction .

		Professor
F. C. Porter	PERSON	contributes the third article on ''
Yetser Hara	PERSON	, '' '' the evil inclination , '' or '' imagination '' in the Old Testament , rabbinical literature , etc. .

		This is a valuable addition to our knowledge of this important Hebrew term . ''

		The Significance of the Resurrection , '' by Professor
Moulton	PERSON	, ''
Stephen	PERSON	's Speech , '' by Professor
Bacon	PERSON	, and '' The
Moham	PERSON	- medan Conquest of
Egypt	LOCATION	and
North Africa	LOCATION	-LRB- 643 - 705 A. D. -RRB- , '' by Professor Torrey , are the con - cluding scholarly contributions to this valuable bicentennial volume of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few appreciative sketches on mu - interesting gj ^ g ^ i subiects , written by Mr.
Filson	PERSON	musical estays .

		• ' , i i • i i - i Young , have been published under the title of '' Mastersingers '' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- .

		While there has been no effort to deliver a critical judgment upon the music and musicians written about , the author has penned a truthful record of the effect that certain works , differing widely one from the other , produce on a single mind .

		In three successive chapters we are given a critical analysis of ''
Bach	PERSON	's Organ Fugues , '' ''
Mozart	PERSON	's Requiem , '' and '' Tschaikowsky 's Sixth Symphony . ''

		To those who are familiar with these works , and yet have but a slight knowledge of the meaning of all the leading motives that are inter - woven into textures of inexpressible beauty , the author 's treatment of the subjects has a pictorial suggestiveness that enables one to dispense with a thorough understanding of the actual music .

		Stu - dents of music will appreciate the manner in which certain musical ideas have been revealed , -- for the fruitless search after a single pregnant and striking musical idea in a forest of contrapuntal solfeggios and roulades is certainly not a pleasurable exercise of mental ingenuity .

		Another interesting chv ^ ter in the book is devoted to
Charles Villiers Stanford	ORGANIZATION	.

		No man better deserves a place ll ` ofllZ '' ^ '' ^ ' ^ `` g `` American Men of Energy '' than does General
Israel Putnam	PERSON	, a life of whom by
William Farrand Livingston	PERSON	has been added by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	to the brief series of biographies bearing that name .

		The en - ergy of `` Old Put '' needed not to be brought to mind , for too many legends concerning the old hero are still afloat .

		But the volume is needed to cor - rect what may be a current misapprehension , too likely to arise in such cases , that there was not behind the marvellous energy and daring the more solid qualities of ability and character .

		While the facts given are out of historical perspective , as in most biographies , and
General Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's part is made almost the central one in the war , after all allowances are made one can not but conclude that he was really an able general and a broad-minded statesman in his political views .

		That
Washington	LOCATION	made him his right-hand man during the early years of the Revolution , would almost settle the matter .

		The earlier part of the story , recounting the services of the hero as scout and officer in the French and Indian War , is a constant succession of venturesome and almost foolhardy deeds ; but the reader feels throughout that there are shrewdness and good sense behind the daring exploits .

		Men and event * '' The Irish question , '' as Lord Rose - in 18th-century bery once happily remarked , '' has
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		never passed into history because it has never passed out of politics . ''

		Mr.
C. Litton Falkiner	PERSON	quotes this observation in the preface to his '' Studies in Irish History and Biography '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , and adds that he can not hope to escape criticism from the point of view of Irish politics .

		His chapters are devoted mainly to eighteenth-century characters , and he has aimed to exhaust all available sources of information .

		Most of these studies have already seen the light in the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, '' the '' Quarterly , '' and other reviews and magazines , and one is expanded from a short article contributed to the '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Grattan , Clare ,
Castlereagh	LOCATION	,
Plunket	PERSON	,
Thomas Steele	PERSON	, Sir
Boyle Roche	PERSON	, and the Earl - Bishop of
Derry	LOCATION	claim each a chapter , while the last third of the volume is devoted to an account of the French invasion of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The reputed father of the Irish bull is , of course , the most diverting character in the book , and one regrets that more space could not have been allowed him .

		Scholarly treatment and fairness of tone make this collection of Irish studies by an Irishman a work of more than passing interest .

		The love-letters of Napoleon . ''

		Napoleon 's Letters to
Josephine	LOCATION	, 1796-1813 '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , translated and edited by Mr.
H. F. Hall	PERSON	, serve , with the aid of copious notes , wide margins , and thick paper , to make up a presentable volume .

		The letters for the .

		period of the first Italian campaign depict the impassioned lover , and are of interest
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 358 in illustrating
Napoleon	PERSON	's romantic temperament in early manhood .

		Those of 1806-7 , at the time of the war with
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, indicate a thought - ful interest in keeping
Josephine	PERSON	informed of the progress of the campaign , but are brief and hur - ried .

		In all save the first period , any one of these so-called letters might easily be reproduced upon a modern postal card , and few have any inherent personal interest .

		They are largely mere abbrevi - ated records of events , accompanying a perennial injunction to Josephine to be * ' contented and happy . ''

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	has fulfilled the duties of an editor very acceptably , placing before each letter a statement of the leading contemporary events , while his arrangement is logical , and his translation happy .

		This presentation enhances such interest as the letters may possess .

		Notes .

		The first four issues of '' The Unit Library '' have reached our table .

		This library is to consist of reprints of standard literature , published at a low price , which is reckoned upon the basis of ^ d , for every `` unit '' of twenty-five pages .

		Another penny is added for a paper cover , and something more for cloth and leather bind - ings .

		The books now published are '' The Vicar of Wakefield '' -LRB- 9 units -RRB- , `` A Sentimental Journey '' -LRB- 6 units -RRB- , '' The Origin of Species '' -LRB- 20 units -RRB- , and
Emerson	PERSON	's '' English Traits '' -LRB- 8 units -RRB- .

		The editions are unabridged .

		This enterprise bids fair to do for English readers what has been done so successfully in the case of German readers by the '' Universal - Bibliothek '' of
Phillip Reclam	PERSON	, from which the idea has evidently been borrowed .

		We have received from the
Atlanta University Press	ORGANIZATION	an interesting discussion of '' The Negro Common School , '' being a report of a social study made under the direction of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and now edited by Dr.
W. E. Burghardt Du Bois	PERSON	.

		These studies of the negro problem which are being made with so much intelligence by
Atlanta University	ORGANIZATION	are of great socio - logical and educational value , and deserve to be widely examined .

		Perhaps the most striking showing made by the present pamphlet is that for the last thirty years the negroes of the former slave states have paid for their own schools -LRB- contrary to the usual idea -RRB- , and that the negroes of the whole country have contributed during the past generation no less than
forty millions of dollars	MONEY	for the education of their children .

		An extra number of the ''
Johns Hopkins University Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Historical and Political Science '' is made up of tributes to the late
Herbert B. Adams	PERSON	.

		The chief contributions are by Messrs.
J. M. Vincent	PERSON	,
Richard T. Ely	PERSON	,
Daniel C. Gilman	PERSON	, and
Burr J. Ramage	PERSON	.

		The greater part of the volume is devoted to a bibliography of the work done .

		by men connected with the depart - ment of History , Politics , and Economics during its first quarter-century .

		The showing made is truly im - posing , and helps us to understand what the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	influence has done for American scholarship .

		It has been a fertilizing and fructifying influence throughout the whole country , and has amply justified the far-sighted wisdom of its late President .

Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	1804-5-6 NOTWITHSTANDING that in
America	LOCATION	few names are more familiar upon the tongue than
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, it is a singular fact that at the present moment a full and adequate account of what they did is almost unattainable .

		The complete journals of the explorers are still in manuscript .

		The pubhshed work of 18 14 , abridged and adapted from the journals by the accomphshed
Nicholas Biddle	PERSON	-LRB- though the name of another appears on the title-page as editor -RRB- , has long been out of print .

		The frag - mentary accounts that preceded the

		The noble reprint of the
Biddle	PERSON	edition which appeared in
1893	DATE	, prefaced , annotated , and supple - mented in every needful way by Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	, a work of great bulk and cost , has quite disappeared from the market .

		At the present moment whoever desires to own the story of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	must content himself with abridged compendia or unsatisfactory reprints , or pay high for copies , usually tattered and mildewed , in auction rooms and the stores of dealers in old books .

		The lack thus existing , felt now more and more as the centenary of the great ex - ploration draws near ,
Messrs.	LOCATION
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	propose to make good .

		In the
early Fall of 1902	DATE	, there will appear over their imprint a beautifully printed edition of the Travels in handy form , at a popular price , which will be planned to fill all the requirements of libraries and private buyers , and thus become the standard edition of this great American classic .

		The text will be that of the
Biddle	PERSON	edition , which must hold its place as the only account approaching adequacy .

		This new edition , then , will be a reprint of the
Biddle	PERSON	text of 18 14 complete .

		Its bulk will not be increased by annotation , but it will be carefully supervised by Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	, Librarian of the
Minneapolis Pubhc Library	ORGANIZATION	, a well-known speciaHst in matters pertaining to Western history , the author of `` A Short History of the Mis - sissippi Valley '' and `` A History of the

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	will prepare a careful analytic Index , a feature which the original edition lacked , and furnish an Introduction giving the events which led up to the great expedition , and the vast development that has flowed from it , in a way to make plain the profound significance of the achievement .

		Fac-similes of all the maps of the 18 14 edition will be given , together with the best extant portraits of the heroes of the enterprise .

		The edition will be in two square octavo volumes of over 500 pages each , printed from a new font of pica old style type , on an extra quality soft laid paper , with uncut edges .

Junel	PERSON	, ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATICALLY INTERESTING CHAR - acters of the history of the world and one of the most audacious schemes ever foisted upon a credulous nation , form the subjects of an unusually able and intensely interesting romance by
Emerson Hough	PERSON	.

		= ^ The title of the book will disclose both secrets .

		It is `` The Mis - sissippi Bubble . ''

		The chief person is , of course , that intense figure of adventure and finance ,
John Law	PERSON	, of
Lauriston	LOCATION	, the man who was greater than kings , who made and unmade ministers , who conjured and threw away fortune after fortaue ; the man whose loves were Olympic , in quantity as well as in quality , whose repute was of all colors and , because of its electric brightness , is now almost mythical ; the man who drove half the old world crazy by the inflation of the new , and who , the bubble pricked , as lavishly returned half
France	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	and dropped from her sight forever , her curses ringing after him .

		Around this man 's compelling comet of a life Mr.
Hough	PERSON	has con - structed a romance that runs like a smooth road over great mountains and into deep valleys , a road that glitters with the gems of cleverness and brilliancy .

		It is surprising as well as pleasing in these days to find a novel written of other days compacted with the skill and graced by the style that the author of '' The
Mississippi	LOCATION	Bubble '' has achieved in this work .

		Law 's brilliant financial genius , his devil 's luck at cards , his fatal duel and consequent imprisonment and condemnation , his love and its ill-omened returns , his escape and flight to the new Western world , are told ably and effectively .

		The tide of historical opinion seems to have turned in favor of
John Law	ORGANIZATION	's honesty and sincerity in the tremendous scheme which made him for a time the greatest millionaire among hundreds in his new adopted country -- and Mr.
Hough	PERSON	has made the most of it .

		To the end the story is told with a grace and delicacy as well as force and power that count for much .

		Facta and Comments '' will surely become the most popular of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's works .

		The topics discussed are of general interest .

		At the hands of the unskilled they would be commonplace .

		From the analytical brain of a philosopher of the g ^ reatness of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	-- a greatness that has extended over more than two generations -- the subjects treated -- any subject , in fact , -- assumes a commanding importance .

		Such topics as `` Americanisms , '' `` Presence of Mind , '' '' The Corruption of Music , '' `` The Origin and Development of Music , '' `` Estimates of Men , '' `` State Education , '' etc. , are invested with a life and actuality only possible under his stimulating treatment .

		With this book one finds a certain mellowness , a certain richness and fulness of Savor , that tend toward a feeling of closer personal relationship with the author .

		He places before the reader , in his sketch of forest dis - tribution , a most interesting picture of American wood - lands , which emphasizes the importance of a source not only of wealth , but of safety , much neglected in past years .

		Aside from the value of this book to special students and to those interested in the forests for eco - nomic reasons , the work is full of suggestions to owners of country homes and to all who care for nature .

		NOTES ON NOVELS 389 LITERARY NOTES 393 A HUNDRED BOOKS FOR SUIVLVIER READING 394 -LRB- A select list of some recent publications . -RRB-

		TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 396 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 398 THE NOVEL OF AMER ICAN HISTORY .

		Many are the
Cassandra	PERSON	voices of to-day , fore - telling decadence and doom to the historical ro - mance .

		Each new novel of problem or tempera - ment is heralded as that long-awaited giant that shall overthrow the tenacious yet shrivelled race of historical romancers and hurl them from their vaunted throne in the reading-world .

		Meanwhile , undisturbed by the maledictions and prophesies , authors continue to write at maximum soul-sapping speed , and publishers continue to announce '' fifty thousand copies sold ten days before publication . ''

		There are strong indications that reaction from this mercantile excess , this flamboyant advertise - ment of wares of the brain and fancy , must come as a relief to the judicial and scholarly reader .

		No one would deny that among the much-advertised and widely-read novels of the last five years a few have that intrinsic grasp and vital portraiture of mien and soul that will gain for them a place among the potent and representative books of the age .

		Despite such concessions , however , one must also admit that there are scores of volumes appear - ing annually , announced with glaring headlines , whose only claim to favor is in the dangerous and alluring appeal to overstrained imagination or neu - rotic passion .

		Such novels , fortunately , become literary comets , and their effect is soon obscured .

		Amid many inferior and sensational ventures , products of clever ambitions rather than sincere literary expression , the historical novel has yet reestablished itself upon the higher planes of fic - tion , and , through a few worthy volumes , has pro- claimed the sanative and energizing influence of this form of fiction , until it has reached a stead - fast response unrivalled since the days of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Whatever may be the decrease in the astounding sales of historical fiction during the next few years , whatever may become the next dominant literary fashion , it is safe to affirm that the historical novel , which has sincere purpose and literary power , has again attained a sure rank in contemporary literature .

		Previous to the
last half decade	DATE	, this literary type had endured disfavor for more than a quarter - century .

		After the works of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Bulwer	PERSON	, and
Cooper	PERSON	, the historical fiction , with few exceptions , was poorly executed and little read .

		In
1889	DATE	, Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	, in a criticism upon one of the exceptional novels of this class , Hardy 's '' Passe Rose , '' admitted its skilful work - manship , but added , '' The historical novel is at low ebb . ''

		He naade the prediction that this desuetude was permanent , and that neither scholars nor un - cultured readers had further need of this `` hybrid ' * form .

		And yet the need and response came as a healthful reaction from novels of extreme morbid 870 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, realism , or elemental local tales , whose simplicity at first pleased , then satiated , the reading world .

		A demand was created for more virile imaginative forms , and , in revival , appeared the novel of action , with two distinct literary expressions , -- first , the novel of contemporaneous work and heroism , exampled by Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	, or Miss French ; and second , thehistorical romance that has regatablished its rightful claim .

		In no country has this form of romance met with more extravagant and long-lived favor than in
America	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , while old-world scenes in new panoramas have commanded ready sale , while
Stevenson	PERSON	and
Weyman	PERSON	,
Galdos	PERSON	and
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, have been favorites , while the daring and zest of such a story as '' The Helmet of Navarre '' has received passing plaudits , yet the primal interest has centred about romances of national history .

		Though occasional critics attributed the new patriotism in literature to the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, yet its manifestation preceded this national event and has a more logical and sequential growth .

		It is akin to the changes in moods and tenets of life and letters during the last century .

		The parity of realism and picturesqueness is typical of the pres - ent age and has found special illustration in history and fiction .

		While readers make adroit synthesis of cause and result , while they trace the philosophy of great world-movements , they no longer welcome detailed philosophical methods by historians or fic - tionists .

		Buckle and
Hallam	PERSON	are still classic , but the scenic historians ,
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Froude	PERSON	,
Fiske	PERSON	and
Parkman	PERSON	, represent the present-day attitude toward the past .

		Our democratic age has no de - sire to see characters '' strut across the stage , '' or `` step out from history 's pages '' ; we are anxious to know the true man , stripped of his insignia .

		Perhaps our characteristic unreserve , which often borders on irreverence , has never been so well ex - pressed as in the semi-satirical lines of
Halleck	PERSON	, descriptive of the early democratic traits of his countrymen who '' Would shake hands with a king upon his throne , And think it kindness to His Majesty . ''

		The historical romancer is confronted by a seri - ous problem in portraiture of historical characters ; in many of the more recent and most artistic novels , as in the best work of
Scott	PERSON	and
Cooper	PERSON	, the lead - ing historical persons are in the background , not before the constant glare of the foot-lights .

		The more prominent characters in the story are ficti - tious or lesser-known to history .

		The skilful intro - duction of real historical heroes in minor rdles is a strong and safe method of emphasizing the atmos - phere .

		To make this scenic quality vivid , to reveal a creative and , at the same time , a relevant im - agination , constitute the essential aims of the his - torical novel .

		The reader may easily gauge the writer 's scholarship by his success in attaining a true pictorial atmosphere .

		Droll anachronisms are found in some of the most popular fiction .

		To carelessly mingle history and fiction , in the setting of the story , is dangerous ; the reader of such stories , found among the most popular works of Scott and Bulwer no less than later writers , often carries through life delusions on important events and periods of history .

		Some recent novels and dramas of American his - tory have done gross injustice to real persons and scenes chosen for reproduction .

		To apotheosize
Aaron Burr	PERSON	or villainize
Israel Putnam	LOCATION	, to scoff at
Franklin	LOCATION	's services for our country at the court of
France	LOCATION	or to bestow immortal youth upon
Barbara Freitchie	PERSON	, -- such perversions of facts perjure the historian and weaken the romancer .

		Again , many authors fail to adapt their diction to the colloquialisms of the times .

		There is a ludicrous aspect to a popular tale of the Revolution couched in the ultra-journalistic phrases of to-day , with references to prospective '' sky-scrapers '' and interchange of debonair club - life greetings .

		With many good qualities and evi - dence of wide reading , the gifted author of '' A Son of the Old Dominion '' loses the effect of her atmosphere when , in a thrilling narrative of Indian strife , she pauses suddenly and declares that these events '' are all recorded in history , '' or , with yet greater offense , quotes directly from history , wholly destroying the illusion of her background .

		Such flaws suggest the substitution of the historian for the novelist ; the historian may study his events , the novelist must assimilate his studies and then portray .

		Thackeray and
Charles Reade	PERSON	in the past , Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, and
Miss Murfree	LOCATION	in the present , excel in almost perfect reproduction , even incarnation , of chosen periods ; and these results are often gained without the introduction of familiar historical persons .

		A wide sympathy with the world 's successive cycles , but a concentrated study of a particular period , characterize the best novelists of history .

		James ,
Ainsworth	PERSON	,
Miss Muhlbach	PERSON	, of the past , have many kinsmen among current American romancers .

		They show versatility and marvellous industry , but such incomplete and inchoate panoramas will soon be forgotten as literature .

		Some of the honored names in historical fiction have produced only one or two novels . ''

		Callista , '' ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	, '' '' In His Name , '' are types of such exceptional and vital work .

		This last title suggests one of the earlier novels of American history whose favor has never been submerged .

		An English magazine of recent date mentioned this as '' the best
Ameri	PERSON	- can historical novel . ''

		In brief retrospect one may recall other early fiction of American history that has merited its immortality amid diverse literary fashions and vacillating standards of criticism .

		If
Cooper	PERSON	often wearies with his prolix diction and his careless structure , he created two worthy novels of distinctive and thrilling action in '' The Spy '' and '' The Last of the Mohicans , '' and thereby pro- claimed himself the pioneer romancer of American forests and frontier battle-lines .

		Amid the sen -
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 sational and imitative work of
Paulding	LOCATION	,
Simms	PERSON	,
Cooke	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Childs	PERSON	, on historical themes , -- volumes seldom opened today , -- Irving has kept a perennial charm for old and young , and his genial , leisurely tales , with American history and legend for motives , have never been more honored and loved than they are in the new century .

		Lowell gave warm praise to a novel of American history that has lost , through some mischance , its merited reading .

		Sylvester Judd 's '' Margaret '' can not be surpassed as a vital portrayal of
New England	LOCATION	life at the meeting of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .

		It is essentially a story of analysis rather than of action , -- a crude yet in - tensive mingling of realism and ideality .

		With the graphic recollections of musters , camp-meetings , huskings , and village schools of the period is inter - woven a story of deep soul-searching power .

		In a letter from
Froude	PERSON	to
Thoreau	LOCATION	, after the latter 's first volume , '' A Week , '' had reached him , the English historian said : * ^ In your book , and in one other from your side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, -- ' Mar - garet ' , -- I see hope for the coming world . ''

		Hawthorne painted an unrivalled atmosphere of colonial
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and , in wonder at his subtle , psychological magic of analysis , one must not for - get his faithful portrayal of early types and cus - toms .

		Decades ago the western pioneer lands were photographed in the fiction of
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	, and
Miss Woolson	PERSON	.

		The strong realism of these stories , often fraught with actual experience , has given them rank both as novels of history and narratives of manners .

		It may be questioned if any historical novelist has revealed greater pic - torial vigor than
Edwin Bynner	PERSON	in ''
Agnes Sur	PERSON	- riage '' and '' The Begum 's Daughter . ''

		Like the true artist in fiction , Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	chose a small dramatic episode about which he could cluster a few strong landmarks and types .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	has immortalized the architecture and manners and speech of
Creole New Orleans	LOCATION	of the past and present , and to one reader , at least , his later ven - tures in more specific tales of war and politics fail to equal the delicate artistic suggestion , and the intensified focalized interest , of these earlier ro - mances of '' Dr.
Sevier	PERSON	, '' '' The Grandissimmes , '' and ''
Madame Delphine	PERSON	. ''

		While American novelists are fast appreciating the unrivalled mines of literary material still un - worked within their land , while few nations have had , within so brief a time , history of so great mo - ment with such varied and faithful records , only a few scattered fragments of our history have thus far been chosen for portrayal by novelists of broad intellect and trained imagination .

		Especially bar - ren of romantic treatment are the periods of settle - ment in the central states , the witchcraft delusion , and that '' critical period of American history '' which succeeded the Revolution and preceded the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The latter event , and the years of political ferment and social and intellectual awaken - ing prior to the Civil War , also afford diverse themes for pictorial narrative and vivid characterization , though the dramatic scenes are less distinct .

		Four periods have furnished popular motives for the American historical novelists , -- the first half - century of colonial life in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	, the English-French relations before the French and Indian War , the scenes and characters concentred about the movements of the Revolution - ary army in
New York	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	, and the Civil War with its aftermath of Reconstruction .

		The early settlements in
Virginia	LOCATION	especially afford tempting themes for research and roseate fancy .

		The peculiar comingling of the primeval and the cultured , the interrelations of scholars and royal favorites with the savages and their weird customs , furnish the imagination with matchless episodes .

		In romantic and stirring flavor , the early records of
Virginia	LOCATION	far surpass those of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	colony .

		Their conditions were quite distinctive , and the attempt to correlate these in one romance , as in ''
King Noanett	PERSON	, '' disclosed the detached back - grounds which defied the novelist 's attempted junc - ture and remained coeval only in time .

		History has made us more familiar with the aspects of the Pilgrims and the Puritans ; we have too much neg - lected the histories of Virginian life by
Byrd	PERSON	and
Beverly	LOCATION	.

		The portrayal of scenes at
Jamestown	LOCATION	and
Flower da Hundred	ORGANIZATION	has the charm of sensuous atmosphere and unique romantic traditions .

		Mrs.
Goodwin	PERSON	's romances , despite technical defects , retain one 's interest ; and '' White Aprons '' and '' The Colonial Cavalier '' are pure and vivid in back - ground and in emotional treatment .

		The pictorial and pathetic episodes of '' wife-auction '' and slave - commitment have been forcefully revealed in '' Prisoners of Hope , '' `` To Have and to Hold , '' and `` Free to Serve . ''

		In Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's initial story , and in her later romances , one is especially impressed by her vital prodigal skill in rapid nar - rative .

		After reading ''
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, ''
Steven	PERSON	- son wrote to
Conan Doyle	PERSON	: `` That is the class of literature that I like when I have the tooth-ache . ''

		Of this thrilling type was '' To Have and to Hold , '' and the reader , chained to the breathless whirl of the author 's imagination , did not pause to note the dramatic flaws until the race was finished .

		Then the unbroken succession of adventures with Indians , pirates , panthers , poisons , and shipwrecks , seemed less real , and he began to question the probable method by which
Jeremy Sparrow	PERSON	killed those last three Indians , and realized that his imagination , like the author 's , was wearied of devising ways and means . ''

		Audrey '' is a distinct advance upon the earlier romances of this author , and the character of the heroine reveals rare insight and delicacy of portraiture ; far more restraint is noted in the structure of events , though there are still evidences of immature literary powers .

		The very names of
Pontiac	LOCATION	and
Quebec	LOCATION	are sug - gestive of romance and dramatic history , and their 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, possibilities have been well tested by
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	.

		The famous battle on the
Plains of Abraham	ORGANIZATION	has yet to receive more vivid portrayal than in '' The Seats of the Mighty . ''

		It is the privilege of a his - torical romancer to choose a mystery or a mooted tradition about some historical character , and inter - weave upon this thread a story of double charm .

		To this type of fiction belongs '' Henry
Esmond	PERSON	'' and `` Unknown to History '' of the past , and the recent romances , '' When Valmond Came to Pon - tiac , '' Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's fanciful tale of the traditional son of
Napoleon	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's alluring picture of the
Dauphin	LOCATION	, escaped from
France	LOCATION	and meeting sundry adventures in
America	LOCATION	under the name of ''
Lazarre	PERSON	. ''

		As in her earlier stories of frontier life in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	has shown a scholarly , leisurely portrayal .

		Perhaps no historical romance of pioneer life in the North - west , with interrelations of Indians , French , and English , has equalled in romantic daring and pic - torial glow '' Alice of Old Vincennes . ''

		The younger generation of American students may gain correct and broad views of the Revolu - tionary struggle , and just estimates of both Tory and Patriot leaders .

		The old-time hatred and surmises have given way before the deep truth - searching attitude of this age .

		Text-books and romances alike respond to this large and true intel - ligence and educated sympathy .

		Among a wide variety of historical novels of recent years , por - traying many phases of this crucial period , three especially suggest parallelisms and contrasts , and have won popular and scholarly success . ''

Pennsylvania	LOCATION	; ``

New Jersey	LOCATION	; ''

Maryland	LOCATION	. ''


Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' surpassed in characterization , ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	'' in scenic and romantic pictures , and ''
Richard Carvel	PERSON	'' in breadth of scope and easeful yet sustained plot .

		Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	has drawn a picture of
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, `` The Conqueror , '' with excess of material and exuberance of laudation .

		There ar ^ , however , a few scenes of historical and dramatic vigor , portrayals both of crucial scenes during the war , viewed from close range by the great generals , and also emphasis of that lesser - known yet vital conflict which transformed the chaotic , anarchical states at the close of the war into a federation .

		If she has overestimated the part played by her hero in some of these events , she has vivified the struggle for Federalism and has surrounded
Hamilton	PERSON	with a large and diverse group of American statesmen , whose salient traits have been well delineated .

		Coeval with the Civil War appeared a few novels of intense lurid force , but utterly lacking in poise and finish .

		While Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's work possessed some qualities that ensured its longer life , the ef - forts of her compeers ,
Simms	PERSON	,
Tourgee	PERSON	,
Lanier	PERSON	, have been wholly submerged .

		In contrast with these fervid novels are the recent portrayals of both the war and the reconstruction blunders , re - sults of calm perspective and judicial adjustment of past conditions after time has allayed the ex - citement and invective .

		The vividness and pene - trative insight are commingled with a scholarly interpretation in such fiction as `` John
March	DATE	, Southerner , '' '' Red Rock , '' '' The Crisis , '' ``
Henry Bourland	PERSON	, '' and `` The Battle-Ground . ''

		While there is no loss of vitality or sympathy , the later novelists have justly emphasized the significant causes and results of the conflict and have treated with impartial colors the heroes and charlatans of both
North and South	LOCATION	.

		The two forms of historical fiction , -- the romance of adventure and the analytic novel of character , -- have been well exampled in recent American fiction .

		The first type is evidenced in such stirring tales as `` The Chief Factor , '' `` To Have and to Hold , '' and '' From Kingdom to
Colony	ORGANIZATION	'' ; the second form is recognized in ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, '' '' The Crisis , '' '' The Reign of Law , '' and '' The Tory Lover . ''

		To avoid the stilted and discursive defects of the earlier nov - elists ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	, and their successors , and at the same time shun the sensational unreserve and haste of some of the most popular later romancers , would seem the safe passage for the historical nov - elist .

		Whether as romance of hazard or narrative of manners , whether restricted to imaginary char - acters or repainting actual personages , the novelist of history should have one ultimate mission , -- to create a story of vital and universal interest , wherein ideality and reality are wisely commingled .

		His task is to illustrate
Carlyle	PERSON	's words : '' The Past has always something true , and is a precioas possession .

		In a different time , in a different place , it is always some other side of our common Human Nature that has been developing itself . ''

		THE ELIZABETHAN PLAY IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		Ever since the mediaeval drama broke away from the Church and got into the public square , and thence into the public theatre-house , the tenure of the theatre , and of dramatic literature regarded as the material for stage-acting , has been an uncertain one .

		This has especially been the case in English - speaking countries , where a certain Puritan prudery distrustful of histrionics , and a certain resolute in - dependence of individual initiative , have kept the • stage a private enterprise and have refused to recog - nize its institutional function .

		On the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	things have turned out otherwise , and in many cities the theatre is a recognized institution supported and countenanced by the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		With us of late there are some signs of change .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 378 A converted few are urging an endowed theatre .

		And just as the universities and large public schools of the English renaissance practised stage-perfor - mances , in both Latin and English , as a regular and recognized part of the college activities , so now the American universities are rapidly if somewhat blindly beginning to enlarge their horizons , admit the educative and cultural value of the practical dramatic art , and make Sophocles ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Jonson	PERSON	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest , a living text as well as a closet page .

		The ideally equipped university of the immediate future will doubtless have , alongside of its other laboratories , what without undue forcing of the already hackneyed metaphor we may call a labor - atory of dramatic art , -- a theatre-building adequate for the presentation of classical plays from Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, English , French , German , and other litera - tures .

		And not only this , but sufficient equipment and endowment ; so that provision can be made for regular and frequent performances of this sort without overtaxing the energies of the regular teaching sta # P. Indeed , as this is an age of aggre - gation and trusts , who knows but that a full-fledged theatre with a stock-company drawn from the Slite of the profession may before long settle down next to some university campus , -- in short , an endowed theatre under university management and control !

		Meanwhile , the ferment is working .

		Harvard ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Beloit	LOCATION	, Wel - lesley ,
Smith	PERSON	,
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	,
Tufts College	ORGANIZATION	, and other institutions , have all made a beginning and have attempted the revival and stage-presentation of such specimens of the world 's dramatic literature as are recognized as classical or typical .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is the latest convert to the new principle .

		A year ago a student performance of `` As You Like It '' was given on the university campus , and again on
May 17	DATE	last , at the Auditorium Theatre in
Chicago	LOCATION	, a performance of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's com - edy of '' The Case is Altered '' in the Elizabethan manner was given , not , it is true under the direct auspices of the university , but by university students , and under the direction of a body composed chiefly of faculty members , faculty wives , and students , working together as the
University Settlement League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English department was called upon for advice ; Mr.
S. H. Clark	PERSON	of the department of public speaking assisted in training the actors ; and Mr.
F. L. Short	PERSON	, who has already had a main hand in some five or six such performances , came on from the
East	LOCATION	and managed the stage production .

		An elaborate illustrative programme was printed , and the occasion was further commemorated by the issuance of a reprint of the play itself , with brief introduction and text reconstituted on the basis of the original edition .

		The affair itself was a success .

		A large and sympathetic audience , tolerant of amateurism and friendly to the main cause , grati - fied its curiosity and reaped amusement in various forms .

		If the audience was tolerant and made concessions so also did the university managers , who at points were forced to yield minor details of antiquarian accuracy to the exigency of popular effect .

		Indeed , any such performance must in some measure be a compromise .

		But the main effect was secured .

		That the path has been broken and a beginning made is a matter for congratulation , and is due chiefly to the admirable energy of the ladies of the League and its efficient managers and advisers .

		Three or four conclusions are to be gathered from this experiment .

		One is that the experiment is worth repeating , -- perhaps under different con - ditions .

		Again , that the atmosphere of the uni - versity -- the university on its own grounds and in its own house -- is better for such a thing .

		The Auditorium stage was not well adapted for the pro- duction .

		The Elizabethan audience , which should have served the function of chorus and intermediary between the actors and the modern audience , was partly hidden from sight in a narrow space , or else too much crowded upon the Elizabethan stage itself .

		A university theatre-building is needed , with con - vertible stage and ample room in the pit for the accommodation of either Elizabethan stage and audience on the one hand , or of Greek chorus on the other .

		The students on this occasion , both in the play and in the Elizabethan audience , contrib - uted their parts with admirable spirit and willing - ness .

		A considerable part of the value of such performances is obviously the training gained by those who take part .

		Another time , however , the experiment might be varied by securing the assist - ance of semi-professionals -LRB- at least -RRB- in the major parts of the cast , as was done in the
Harvard	LOCATION	per - formance of '' Epicceae , '' leaving the joyous business of the mock-audience , as always , to the students .

		Another time , too , with a cast so strengthened and with more time for drill and preparation , a stronger play may be hazarded .

		Then also the local '' busi - ness , '' -- archteological details and reproductions in culture-history , -- on which so much of the pictur - esque effect depends , can be more carefully elab - orated .

		Perhaps , for example , in the course of time a university audience can be led to the point of patiently and sympathetically listening ' to an entire Shakespearian play , uncut -LRB- a matter often of between three and four hours -RRB- , and in the original setting .

		Such things are as yet unknown in
America	LOCATION	.

		In
Munich	LOCATION	, however , the present writer has listened to a four-hour performance of the unabridged German '' Hamlet . ''

		The success of the
University	ORGANIZATION	last year in its performance of '' As You Like It '' in modern form would suggest the possibility of a still greater academic success in similar things in the stricter original form and setting .


Chicago	LOCATION	is ready to furnish appreciation and support ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	has the requisite energy , atmosphere , learning , and personnel .

		The one thing lacking is the material equipment .

		Will that be provided ?

		In Garden Ways .

		*
Charles Lamb	PERSON	had a list of hibliaa-biblia , -- books which , though they contain printed mat - ter , '' are not books . ''

		It is questionable whether books consisting entirely of illustrations , with almost no printing , can be termed literature ; but several of the garden books which appear this season manage to convey an infinite amount of information with scant printed words , -- trusting to the sight of the things themselves as shown in lavish illustration .

		Two of the largest and most important of these books are collections of drawings and photographic re - productions , relating , one to English and Scotch gardens , the other to American gardens .

		It has been pleasant to study them together , to compare them , and to note the differences in the gardens thus represented .

		Mr.
Inigo Triggs	PERSON	's work on `` Formal Gar - dens in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	'' is in three parts .

		Part I. has 118 pages of plates ; of these , but sixteen are actual photographs of English and Scotch gardens , while the others are sketch-plans and elevations , drawings of gates , walls , bits of terraces , fountains , sun - dials , garden houses , lead figures , vases , col - umns , cornices , balustrades , dove-cotes , garden - steps , knots , parterres , and various garden - furnishings .

		The photographs of gardens in this part contribute little that is new to the published information about English gardens , especially to those who have read the pages and seen the illustrations in `` Country Life '' during the six years of its existence .

		But the sketch - plans and elevations are of great interest and value , both to garden-lovers and garden-archi - tects .

		Part II .

		of Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	's work shows a wonderful advance over Part I. both in interest and beauty .

New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane	PERSON	.

		the views given in this book are unusual and effective , and it is most gratifying to have the skilfully-drawn sketches , elevations , and bird 's - eye views of those well-known gardens , also many of their effective details and out-of-the - way corners .

		The Englishman has ever felt `` the lure of green things growing , '' as said Piers
Plowman	PERSON	; and in all greenery his garden excelled those of any land .

		At this day the great - est difference between English and American gardens is not in the flowers but in the per - fect lawns , the splendid hedges , the topiary work of the old-world pleasaunces ; in all , in fact , that shows the skilled care of many , many years .

		Our few hedges are all new ; an old hedge is almost unknown in
America	LOCATION	; for the yews and hollies of English hedges did not flourish here .

		With the recent establishment of hedges , an air of stability and finality has been given to our gardens , which has added infinitely to their charm .

		The book entitled `` American Gardens , ' * edited by the well-known architect Mr.
Guy Lowell	PERSON	, has been frequently compared to a somewhat similar book on English gardens , called `` Gardens Old and New '' ; and the American photographs have been disparaged .

		They certainly equal the English views in quality ; but some may appear inferior because there are two or even four views on a single page , -- an arrangement which is to be de - plored .

		It was not the intent of the American book , as of the English one , to display only the views of costly and elaborate gardens of houses of great wealth ; many views are given of old gardens of small size and historic in - terest , others of small size but of great artistic merit .

		The views of old gardens are in general the most pleasing .

		In looking over the assem - bled American views , I am struck with the indigenous aspect which the American garden has developed .

		We have taken our plans and notions from foreign gardens , chiefly those of
England	LOCATION	, with hints from
Holland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	; but
Nature	ORGANIZATION	has prohibited an exact imitation and suggested new features entirely unlike the gardens of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		So wonderfully is this shown in this book that I am led to believe that garden-making will become a representa - tive art in
America	LOCATION	, and be regarded as an in - digenous art , -- if such a term be proper .

		I am glad to think of this book as going to
England	LOCATION	, where it will show to English readers how unlike a real American garden is the so - called `` American garden '' of the English florist and gardener , -- a garden where crim -
1902	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 375 son , purple , and magenta rhododendrons are blended and jumbled , and bordered with pink and orange and salmon azalias ; a garden which contains a few plants of what the English gar - dener calls '' American wood-lilies , '' and dog - tooth violets , and
California	LOCATION	poppies , and which is supposed to `` remind us of home . ''

		An - other agreeable truth proved by this American book of gardens is the fact that a lovely gar - den and even a formal garden is within the possibility of the flower-lover of moderate means .

		Photography often gives an exagger - ated perspective , and has made some of these gardens appear much larger than they really are .

		But a majority of those shown are of comparatively slight cost and not of large size ; in fact , some of the most charming are the least costly ones .

		The book has a few well - written pages as a prologue , and as an epilogue the sketch-plans of all the formal gardens pic - tured in it .

		The Introduction is so well written and interesting that the reader wishes it were much longer .

		These two books offer an answer to the question asked so frequently of late , '' Where can I find drawings and views to aid me in laying out a formal garden ? ''

		Usually it is also qualified by being a small formal garden ; which makes somewhat superfluous the reply , '' Employ a skilled architect to make drawings and estimates for you . ''

		The great need in a successful formal garden is that it shall be '' on scale , '' and of course a skilled designer is far more able to accomplish this than a hap - hazard flower-lover .

		For the garden changes ; shrubberies alter in density and shape ; trees grow surprisingly ; it hurts so to cut down a tree , or remove a beautiful shrub ; and in a few years all the proportions of the garden are changed and lost .

		The writer of this review has a winter home in the city of
Greater New York	LOCATION	, which chances to be upon the block chosen , on ac - count of the permanency of its residents , by the Municipal Art League of that city to prove what can be done to beautify a block of city houses by means of tree and vine planting , and the placing and planting of window-boxes .

		This block was jestingly dubbed the '' Block Beautiful '' -LRB- though the name and adjective seem to have naught in common -RRB- .

		The fami - lies resident thereon all leave the city in early
summer	DATE	and do not return till late autumn ; so the adorning of these houses is purely a public - spirited deed , to gratify the eyes of chance passers-by , -- who are chiefly , in mid-summer , the city 's poor .

		In the planting of window - boxes in this Block Beautiful , much monotony at first obtained .

		We had scarcely more variety than the '' widow-woman '' of '' Pas - quile 's Jests '' -LRB- 1604 -RRB- , wherein it was told at a country-inn , as a matter of vast wonder , that in
London	LOCATION	the citizens '' take in their gardens at night within their windows , and let them out in the morning . ''

		Whereat gaping yokels went up to
London	LOCATION	town in a body to see the rare sight , and they did there behold the widow-woman putting out at her casements boxes of '' Gilly-Flowers , Coronations , and Herbs . ''

		Formal geraniums , pale nasturtiums , graceless aspidistras , and dull ivy replaced in our window-boxes but sadly the sweet - scented , free - blooming , grateful , kindly
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan blossoms of the old jest-book .

		But we have now a little book of scarcely more pages or bigger size , entitled '' Miniature and Win - dow Gardening , '' which offers to all readers great variety of choice in window plants as well as most intelligent advice about making and maintaining the boxes ; and also the plant - ing of small city gardens and our hopeless back-yards .

		The book is so informal in diction and direct in expression , that it is as helpful as having an experienced and intelligent gardener at hand to answer questions ; and it is written for American climate and American money , and in that is a treasure , -- for nearly all in - structive books on gardening are English and in general for the friendly climate of western
England	LOCATION	, and bewilder us with lists of flowers that will blossom in
December	DATE	, and others which should be planted in
January	DATE	. ''

		A Garden in the Suburbs '' is one of the several books evoked of late in the manner of Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's * ' Pot-pourri in a Surrey Gar - den , '' a familiar record of homely thoughts in a home garden , on flowers and fruits , and on subjects suggested by and akin to gardening .

		None of these several followers of Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	have equalled the prototype in interest or value , for hers is the sort of book and sort of literary composition which does not well bear imitation .

		The original had the charm of frank narrative ; but this was the narrative of a charming woman , and the book was also useful . ''

		A Garden in the Suburbs '' is of little value to the American garden-maker , and it is , I believe , the only one of Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's round dozen '' Books about Gardens '' which is not .

		The book is a distinct negative in style ; it is full of what not to do , and what was n't done right , and what that special soil would not grow , and 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, what flowers would not bloom in that garden ; and it communicates this characteristic nega - tion to the reader .

		Among these books of Mr.
Lane	PERSON	's are re - prints of two of the classics of garden-literature , --
Forbes Watson	PERSON	's '' Flowers and Gardens , '' published nearly thirty years ago , and
John Sedding	PERSON	's '' Garden-Craft Old and New , '' pub - lished first in
1890	DATE	.

		A certain pathetic interest attaches to both of these books , written by men of enthusiasm and genius , who died young .

		Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's book was written during the last painful months of an insidious disease , and finished two days before his death .

		Sedding 's had been given to the publishers ; but he died suddenly before it was set in type .

		The first half of Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's book is devoted to a series of monographs on a handful of familiar flowers , the snowdrop , snowflake , daffodil , crocus , and others ; these are the most extraordinary plant - portraits ever written .

		Every line of color , every outline of petal , every curve of leaf , re - vealed to this author the full secret of its beauty and meaning ; and his deeply religious and ar - tistic nature made him understand and translate this secret of plant-life and plant-beauty into words .

		The second part , on Gardens , dealt the first effective blow at `` bedding-out gardening , '' and that at a time when such gardens were a British idol .

		Its two sections , '' Faults in Gar - dening '' and '' Gardeners ' Flowers , '' contain some of the most exquisite sentences and thoughts upon gardens in the English language , and some of the most keenly sarcastic as well .

		In his out - burst against variegated foliage , he ridicules the '' scarlet geranium whose leaf edges are broadly buttered around , '' and writes of '' colors frittered away amid contrasts of leaves , spotted and streaked in every sort of deformity , ... green grounds peppered over with bright red , or tricksily wrought out in cream color . ''

		And with what keen and sensible words he writes of doubled flowers ; not too sweeping in aversion , but giving honor where honor is due -- as to the double peony .

		Part III .

		of the book , '' On Vegetation , '' has an exquisite chapter on '' The Withering of Plants , '' -- a chapter which has a deep inner meaning when we recall that it was written in the fading of the author 's own life .

		The Preface of
John Sedding	PERSON	's book on '' Garden-Craft '' was lovingly written by a fellow-worker in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and displays to us so noble a character , so sensitive , lovable , and impulsive a nature , so beautiful and relig - ious a life , ended with that of his wife Rose in such a touching and unusual manner , that I am tempted do dwell longer on the man than on his book .

		It made so profound an impres - sion on me when I first read it that it has ever stood out in my memory as the record of one of those singularly exalted natures which one meets or reads of so rarely .

		Sedding has been termed by British enthusiasts the ''
Isaak Walton	PERSON	of Gardening . ''

		I search in vain for the slightest verisimilitude of thought which should warrant this title .

		There is nothing in his literary style or his teaching to suggest it ; he has none of
Walton	PERSON	's love of country-life in the fields , nor
Walton	PERSON	's quaintness and sim - plicity of speech ; his book is that of a crafts - man , as its title indicates , and is apparently written to prove the truth of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's line , '' Nothing is more truly the Child of Art than a Garden . ''

		He says plainly : '' Because Art stands sponsor for the grace of a Gar - den , because all gardening is Art or nothing , we need not fear to overdo Art in a garden , nor need we fear to make avowal of the secret of its charm .

		I have no more scruple in using the scissors upon tree or shrub where trimness is desirable than I have in mowing the turf of a lawn that once represented the virgin world .

		There is a quaint charm in the results of the topiary art , in the prim imagery of evergreens that all ages have felt . ''

		He pleads for the cedar-walks , the bowers , the alleys , the mazes , the high hedges of the old English pleasaunce , '' hidden happily and shielded safe . ''

		Sedding 's essays are purely academic in character , and deal with generali - ties rather than special illustrations .

		In the chapter entitled '' The Technics of Gardening '' he enters into some detail , giving suggestions as to the selection and placing of plants and trees , the relations of the house to the terraces , lawns , etc. , and he gives a few sketches and diagrams , of much '' niceness '' of drawing , as became an architect , which he was .

		His chap - ters are thoroughly scholarly , showing ample reading of garden-literature and ready quota - tion .

		He notes ably how the texture of the speech of the old poets
Herrick	PERSON	,
Herbert	PERSON	,
Donne	PERSON	,
Vaughan	PERSON	, and infinitely
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, is saturated with garden-imagery ; and his chapters are persuasive as well , for he had both the culture and the enthusiasm to fit him to write effectively upon his chosen subject .

		He is unsparing of criticism of the `` Natural '' school of gardening , as advocated by Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- inson ; and he formed a strong ally to the party which waged war against that school , though his book has one chapter entitled '' In Praise of Savagery . ''

		The Formal Garden was never

		877 more ably championed ; and he does more -- he makes his readers love it .

		He longed to see the old gardens reproduced everywhere , hoping they would bring back with them the charm of the quiet beautiful life of their day .

		He calls them '' beautiful yesterday , beautiful to-day , beautiful always . ''

		He loved the old gardens for qualities which I have ever felt and loved in them , as tangible shapes of the moods and tastes of our ancestors ; as embodi - ments of ancient worth and stability ; as evi - dences of a devotion to one 's native land and one 's home soil , and interest in and effort to beautify it .

		It is seldom given to a reviewer to help to awaken a general interest in books he has long known and cared for .

		These two books of these two English garden-lovers , printed first in but small number , have been known and beloved by me for over a decade , and I trust their reprints may find hundreds of lovers and readers in
America	LOCATION	in decades to come .

		All day long he sat there , never moving , never talking , -- he seemed to be doing nothing but smoking and dreaming .

		On the third day I pointed this little man out to the merchant who owned the store , and asked what the little man was doing and why he sat there , ' He 's thinking , ' said the merchant .

		• Yes ; but why must he think on that bald spot of ground ?

		What is he going to do ? '

		I asked , perplexed .

		The merchant gazed at me in astonishment , mingled with pity . '

		Don ' t you know , ' he said , ' he is one of our greatest landscape gardeners , and for three days he has been thinking out a garden for me ?

		If you care to come here in a few days , ' he added , ' I will show you the drawings for that garden all completed . '

		I came in a few days , and I was shown the most exquisite set of drawings it has ever been my good fortune to behold .

		What a garden it would be !

		There were full-grown trees , stepping-stones , miniature bridges , ponds of gold-fish -- all presenting an appear - ance of vastness , yet in reality occupying an area the size of a small room .

		And not only was the garden itself planned out and designed , but it was also arranged to form a pattern in relation to the trees and the houses and the surrounding hills . ''

		The Rev.
Julius Smith	PERSON	's `` Ten Years in
Burma	LOCATION	'' is a record of the missions planted in that country by the American Methodist Epis - copal Church , which have gone unrecorded until now , though they are twenty-two years old .

		This country has a particular interest for missionaries from the
United States	LOCATION	, for it was there that
Adoniram Judson	PERSON	and Luther Rice went in
1812	DATE	, the first of their countrymen to 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, embark on this pious enterprise .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	records the fact that the proselytes made by these two men have perpetuated their work , and that to their teachings , borne out in prac - tice , is to be ascribed the survival of the Karens , a race seemingly marked for extinction .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has a great deal to say about the evil effects of intoxicating drink on the Burmese , and yet fails to say that they were , like all un - contaminated Buddhists , among the most ab - stemious peoples in the world until Great
Britain	LOCATION	established the miserable trade in liquor in the kingdom .

		The book shows good progress made , reports the marked results ob - tained by the mission priests of the
Roman Church	ORGANIZATION	, and urges the need of many more laborers in a most promising vineyard .

		It seems a pity that some of these devoted and self-sacrificing men can not conduct a mission to the putative Christians who are selling the Burmese bad rum !

		Dr.
Maltbie Davenport Babcock	PERSON	, pastor of the
Brick Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	, died abroad last year , while engaged in the extended journey which he has set forth in detail in the `` Letters from
Egypt	LOCATION	and Pales - tine , '' now published in response to the demands of his congregation .

		These letters were writ - ten to be read to the
Men 's Association	ORGANIZATION	in the church , and form a continuous narrative of the author 's wanderings in
Egypt	LOCATION	, the Holy Land , and through to
Constantinople	LOCATION	, all art - lessly and vivaciously told .

		Designed for such an audience and not for the general reading public , they are more intimate in their nature than most tales of the kind , and betray a kindly and attractive personality .

		It is not difficult to account for the cause that has sent three books concerning the em - pire of
Morocco	LOCATION	into the world at once .

		The people and their country stand quite alone as Moslem on the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	, wholly under the control of nations reck - oned in
Christendom	LOCATION	until its eastern extremity is reached .

		Slavery and polygamy flourish there unabashed , and the degree of culture is that of centuries ago .

		Nowhere can the civil - ization of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	be left so far behind in so short a voyage , and the land seems destined to secure a larger and larger share of the business of tourists .

		Of the three books , Mr.
Budgett Meakin	PERSON	's `` The Moors '' is some - thing more than a mere record of a brief so - journ .

		By his three preceding volumes on the same general topic , one of them published less than a year ago , Mr.
Meakin	PERSON	has established himself as an authority on the country in all respects , and his preface contains a touching account of the disadvantages and rebuffs under which he began his studies , and the manner in which the difficulties have been surmounted .

		Living long in the land , he has attained the comprehension that leads to sympathy , and his book is everywhere informed with good-will and understanding .

		It differs from its prede - cessors in having a uniformly lighter touch , discussing all sides of Moorish life , and bring - ing out the virtues of the people side by side with their evident limitations .

		He says , for example : '' When a
Moor	ORGANIZATION	is treated to a good joke , he knows how to enjoy it to the full ; and , seated on the floor , he sways backwards and forwards without restraint to his laughter , a common practice being for the speaker and listener so to enjoy it together , raising their right hands far above their heads as they roll back , and then , with a sweep round , bringing them together for a hearty shake : there was never invented a grander way for enjoying a joke .

		The women , when happy , give vent to their feelings by a shrill ululation produced by the soft palate : • Yoo yoo , yoo yoo , yoo yoo yoo ! '

		which it would be difficult for untrained women to produce , and out of the question for men to attempt . ''

		The modern ideas regarding womankind in general have not penetrated to the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	, as the following citation of authority attests : `` The estimation in which Mohammedans hold the common-sense of their women may be judged from the advice of the Imam et-Tarai : * It is desirable for a man , before entering upon any important undertaking , to con - sult ten intelligent friends ; or if he have not more than five such friends , let him consult each of them twice ; or if he have no more than one such friend , he should consult that one at ten different times ; if he have none to consult , let him consult his wife , and whatever she advises him , let him do the opposite ; so shall he pro- ceed rightly in his affair , and attain his object . ' ''

		Miss
Frances MacNab	PERSON	has travelled exten - sively in
South Africa	LOCATION	and
British Columbia	LOCATION	, and though she did not leave the beaten paths in
Morocco	LOCATION	, she brought keen and trained powers of observation to her task of setting forth , in '' A Ride in
Morocco	LOCATION	, '' the facts within her rather narrow limits .

		Of most in - terest to Americans will be the chapter in which she relates the sailing up of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can armored cruiser ''
New York	LOCATION	'' for the pur - pose of settling a dispute with the Moorish empire , and its subsequent sailing away again with its task unaccomplished , amid the broad smiles of the unterrified Moslems , -- indicating that the '' world-power '' business is in need of more training if it is to be successful .

		Our ex - traordinary consular service is illustrated by the following excerpt :
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 `` Morocco is not a country which lends itself to the compiling of reports .

		I never was anywhere where statistics or figures helped one so little , ' They wrote to me from
Washington	LOCATION	, ' said Captain
Cobb	PERSON	, ' to send them a report of the cholera .

		So I started out to see what I could do , and I met two Moors dragging a dead one .

		So I said , '' What killed that man ? ''

		And they said , '' Allah -- Allah killed him . ''

		I went a little fur - ther and met another , and I asked , '' What killed that man ? ''

		and they said , '' Allah . ''

		So I came back , and wrote to say that I had seen two dead Moors , and the people said God had killed them , and that was all I knew . '

		What occurred in
Washington	LOCATION	when this report was received I do not know , but the account gives an absolutely just idea of some of the obstacles in the way of making reports , and the value of some reports when made . ''

		♦ Lady
Agnes Grove	PERSON	visited
Morocco	LOCATION	with her husband and several friends of both sexes , and their experiences and observations are em - bodied in her book entitled '' Seventy-one Days ' Camping in
Morocco	LOCATION	. ''

		She was at Mogador , and went hunting in the mountains , receiving several incidental invitations from natives to visit them in remote districts ; and it is easily to be credited that she would have accepted these if left to herself , notwithstanding the rather disquieting nature of the following passage : ' • Every eminence , every mountain pass , and almost every road in the plain along which we travelled , bear witness in the shape of heaps of stones to battle , murder , and sudden death .

		If a solitary heap is seen , then it has been a murder ; if the heaps are many , then it is the site of one or perhaps several battles -- possibly through one of the murders having created a < blood feud ' between two tribes , when the first murdered man having been avenged , the avenger in his turn is sought out and killed , and so the feud continues from genera - tion to generation , when the origin of the quarrel is a mere tradition and perhaps even unknown .

		Some of the heaps of stones consist of as few perhaps as five stones , but so arranged as to prevent any possibility of their having been mistaken for a natural or accidental heap .

		In some cases the branches of the trees were piled up with stones , showing that the combatant had been shot dead in his post of vantage . ''

		Mr.
Spender	PERSON	, the author of '' Two
Winters	PERSON	in
Norway	LOCATION	, '' seems to have been a fairly good traveller , though he indulges in an occasional British protest because the Norwegian hotels would not give him marmalade or jam for his breakfast .

		His journey to the Lapps , though given a chapter , was absolutely barren of note - worthy results , only a family or two having been visited after a great deal of trouble .

		Per - haps the most interesting chapter in the book deals with '' ski-lobing , '' the national winter sport of the country , consisting of a long slide down a hill on the native snow-shoes , ending in a leap through the air , the difficulty being to come up standing on the snow below .

		Mr.
Spender	PERSON	describes it thus : '' By the judge 's box a flag is lowered , a mournful note is sounded somewhere out of sight , and whilst we are wondering and raising our eyes upwards we espy a black speck racing down the hill , and before we can quite take in what has happened the first jumper has reached the base of the hill .

		We are dullards , and have to collect our thoughts more sharply .

		Another note is sounded , another black figure darts down ; we turn around ; he is in the air , and he too has reached the bottom .

		We have to be sharper still if we wish to watch the jumper throughout .

		First he slips over the brow of the hill , tears down the narrow incline with feet well set , but knees bent and with eyes straining towards the bank from which he is to make his leap .

		There is silence , the breath of everyone is checked , the jumper has reached the platform , he springs right for - ward , away into space , steadies himself in mid-air , still for the tenth of a second , then he drops like a hawk onto the slope of the hill beneath .

		Here comes the real test , for if he has done well he will land so that his right foot is slightly in advance of his left , but pointing straight in front with knees barely bent and his hands rigid at his side .

		Then he slips down as he holds him - self erect into the flat open space beneath , where he joins the little knot of those who have preceded him and are ready to congratulate him upon his neatness of style . ''

		`` A Golden Way , '' by Mr.
Albert Le Roy Bartlett	PERSON	, is a good illustration of the fact that the traveller takes his capacity for enjoyment with him , instead of finding it on the road .

		Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	filled his mind with the literature of
England	LOCATION	and the sister kingdoms before he began his journey across them , -- largely on foot , -- and his book abounds in literary allu - sions .

		In
Ireland	LOCATION	he went to
Muckross Lake	PERSON	, and he preserves some of the anecdotes related to him by his guide , the first in reference to the small island in the middle of that beautiful little sheet of water . ''

		< An ' let me tell yes , * said
Robert	PERSON	, • how thet island came there .

		Do ye see thet mountain up there with the hole in the side ?

		Well , the Divil one marnin ' hed jist taken a bite out of thet mountain for his breakfast , an ' gone on a walk across the lake , whin he met the
O'Donahue	PERSON	.

		The
O'Donahue	PERSON	was a very polite man , an ' whin he met the Divil , '' Good marnin ' to your lard - ship , '' says the
O'Donahue	PERSON	.

		Now the Divil did not wish to be outdone in politeness by the
O'Donahue	PERSON	, an ' '' Good marnin ' to yourself , '' says the Divil .

		An ' whin he opened his mouth , the mouthful fell out an ' made thet island . '

		... '' ' An ' let me tell yes , ' said
Robert	PERSON	, ' two years ago an American gintleman came here , an ' he went up to thet very punchbowl -LSB- a pool just above the lake -RSB- .

		It was a very warm day , an ' he says to me , ''
Robfert	PERSON	, I 'll be after havin ' a swim here . '' ''

		Indade ye must not , '' says I ; `` there 's no bottom to the hole , sir . ''

		`` Thin ,
Robert	PERSON	, '' says he , '' I 'll just dive through it . ''

		An ' nather mesilf nor his frinds could prevint him .

		So he made a great spring , an ' down he wint .

		We waited for him to rise , an ' he niver came .

		Tin minutes , an ' he was n't back .

		An hour more , an ' we gathered up his clothes and wint back to the hotel .

		His frinds were distracted , an ' they wint up the
next day	DATE	, but there was 880 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, no trace of bim .

		They waited there two weeks for him , thinkin ' his body would rise ; but it did n't .

		Now gintle - min , twelve weeks from the day thet he dived there came a telegram from
Australia	LOCATION	, sayin ' , '' I 've arrived .

		Sind on me clothes . '' ' ''

		Lieutenant
J. W. G. Walker	PERSON	, of the
U. S. Navy	ORGANIZATION	, was attached to the party which made the preliminary survey on the Nicaraguan Canal for the
United States Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and he reports strongly in favor of the adoption of that route .

		He believes that either that or the cutting at
Panama	LOCATION	is entirely practicable , and that the cost will be much the same , if the
United States	LOCATION	has to pay no more than
$ 40	MONEY	, - 000,000 for the work already done by the French company at
Panama	LOCATION	.

		He notes , too , that the cost of operating the Nicaraguan route will be
$ 3,300,000	MONEY	a year , not less than
$ 1,300,000	MONEY	more than its rival .

		Then , on the other hand , he sets forth that the more north - erly channel will effect a saving of a day or two on all American commerce , except that com - ing from the South American coasts through the canal to our own shores ,
Atlantic	LOCATION	or
Pacific	LOCATION	; that the hygienic conditions about
Nicaragua	LOCATION	are better , with less interruption from quarantine ; that it is possible to de - velop the countries through which the more northern canal passes , while
Panama	LOCATION	is hope - lessly barren ; and that the trade-winds pre - vailing in the Nicaraguan belt will give sailing ships an advantage of nine days in reaching the termini of the channel .

		The enterprise will be commercially profitable , and much more than self-sustaining , in either event .

		In addition to a pleasant recital of his own experiences in the country , Lieutenant Walker has prepared an historical account of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, including a brief memoir of his kinsman ,
William Walker	PERSON	, the great filibuster .

		The book is one of value , the possibility of the destruction of canal struc - tures by volcanic action being fully anticipated .

		After reciting the disturbances of a seismic nature that have occurred within historic times , the author concludes thus : '' It will be seen that volcanic activity near the canal line is in a state of decadence , and that , judging from appearances , any further outbreak will be likely to occur near the middle of one of the volcanic ranges .

		When it is remembered that the destructive effect of an earthquake is limited to a comparatively small area immediately surrounding the epicentrum , there seems to be no reason for anticipating destructive shocks along the line of the proposed canal .

		Experience tends to show the soundness of this deduction , for shocks which have done much damage in
Leon	LOCATION	and
Managua	LOCATION	have been quite harmless at Rivas . ''

		Mr.
Lanier McKee	PERSON	, author of '' The Land of
Nome	LOCATION	, '' is a recent graduate of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and a lawyer by profession .

		Hearing of the dis - covery of gold at
Nome	LOCATION	-- rather literally `` the jumping-off place of the world , '' as he calls it -- he made a study of the laws governing mining localities as a preliminary , and in
June of 1900	DATE	arrived at the rapidly growing town .

		Here he became interested as the attorney for one of the litigants in a case , or series of cases , which involved enormously valuable interests at that point , and no small part of his breezily told narrative is concerned with the scandal which ensued , riesulting recently in the re - moval of the Alaskan judge opposed to his clients .

		In this recital it is quite evident that he intends to be fair , though an attorney under retainer is not always a disinterested witness .

		Besides this , the book shows the possibilities of success in a mining region without taking part in the arduous manual labor which mining itself involves , granted a sound mind and body .

		The extract following , describing
Nome	LOCATION	itself and the sorrows of some men with more appar - atus than experience , is characteristic . ''

		Hundreds were living in tents upon the beach , thanks to the clemency of the weather .

		Within a very short distance from our camp , with their freight piled about , were the ` syndicate , ' and quite unenthusiastic .

		Actually , the ' syndicate ' were selling out , and without a struggle .

		Several of its members very soon bade us farewell , and pulled out for what they thought the ' real thing * -- quartz mines in
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		And yet some of the mines on
Anvil Creek	ORGANIZATION	even then , and with only a few men shovelling the pay dirt into the sluice boxes , were turning out from ten to
fifteen thousand dollars	MONEY	a day .

		To be sure , this was for the few only , but , at the same time , it went to prove that the country was not a fraud .

		Even the dirt in those miserable
Nome	LOCATION	streets contained < colors , ' or small particles of gold ; and it is an incongruous thought that , of all the cities of the world ,
Nome City	LOCATION	, as it is called , most nearly approaches the apocalyptic condition of having its streets paved with gold ! ''

		Good books of travel are so interesting and so well worth reading , that it is to be hoped the enormous growth of libraries , and the con - sequent increase of moneys available for the purchase of this rather expensive class of books , will soon persuade American publishers into the policy of bringing out enough of them to give
America	LOCATION	fairer and more adequate rep - resentation in comparison with
England	LOCATION	.

		* A genuine interest in bird-study is not a passing emotion .

		Once astir in the earnest heart , the delight of it remains a source of active and ever fresh enjoyment , or abides as a lasting and beautiful memory .

		There is continual proof of this in the literature which embodies the experiences of bird-lovers , all of whom are fervent and most of them eloquent narrators .

		The intensity of their feeling gives them felicity of expression , and they become , as by a masterful impulse , fluent and pictur - esque in dealing with their subject .

		It is so with the lovers of nature in any of its mani - fold phases .

		There is scarcely a volume of the increasing number recording investigations in animal or plant life which is not charming and infectious in spirit and statement .

		Take the '' Nestlings of Forest and
Marsh	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Irene Grosvenor Wheelock	PERSON	, as a chance example .

		tention is worthily rewarded .

		Mrs.
Wheelock	PERSON	is untiring in the acquisition of bird-craft , and has allowed no sacrifice of physical comfort to deter her from the study of the feathered kind in their early growth and development .

		Day after day in
spring	DATE	and a large part of sum - mer , the first flush of dawn has found her on the watch by their cradles in the marsh , the meadow , and the forest , to note the changes in habit and aspect the hours have wrought dur - ing their period of bird-babyhood .

		Burning heat which sent the mercury up into the nine - ties , and the hundreds even , has failed to daunt her .

		She and her faithful companion , the '' Man with the Camera , '' followed the fortunes of rail and quail , blackbird and sandpiper , from the building of the nest to the departure of the valiant fledglings on free , buoyant wing .

		From such unfaltering vigilance there must result new and valuable incidents in the his - tory of bird-life .

		These give Mrs.
Wheelock	PERSON	's book an importance readily recognized .

		The external beauty of the volume adds a feature deserving favorable notice .

		The fair , open page , enriched with text illustrations and pho - togravures from original photographs , are in harmony with the pleasing contents .

		An equally striking instance of the spell which nature-themes exercise over speaker and hearer is afforded in the story of ''
Hezekiah	PERSON	's Wives , '' by Mrs.
Lillie Hamilton	PERSON	French .

		Hezekiah was only a canary bird , and his wives were canaries like himself ; yet the doings of these small and by no means uncommon crea - tures so moved the heart and the imagination of their mistress that her rehearsal of them rouses a kindred enthusiasm in her audience .

		That a bird may have a pronounced personality , that it may approach near to humanity in its qualities , its affections , and its preferences , one is quickly convinced by her persuasive manner of putting the case . ''

		Hezekiah '' was a re - markable specimen of the ovion tribe , there is no doubt ; but his natural gifts were developed to a great extent by the sympathetic compan - ionship of the lady who treated him as one faithful and considerate friend treats another .

		It is suggestive evidence of the capacities of heart and head , as yet for the most part un - suspected , which belong to our fellow-beings in the lower ranks of creation .

		None who make the acquaintance of ''
Hezekiah	PERSON	, '' though at second-hand , can fail to be touched by the record of his virtues and moved to a more kindly regard for all his race .

		A large part of the '' Wild Life of Orchard 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, and Field , '' by Mr.
Ernest Ingersoll	PERSON	, relates to our common birds , the remaining portion treating of small quadrupeds , such as mice , squirrels , and weasels , with one chapter given to notes upon the snail .

		The book is a revision and enlargement of a volume published by the author some years ago under the title of '' Friends Worth Knowing . ''

		In its present form it contains a store of late and curious facts gleaned from wide reading , together with original investigation .

		Mr.
Ingersoll	PERSON	has the art of presenting his matter attractively , and calling to his aid interpretative illustrations .

		A book that can be slipped into the pocket is a desideratum on many occasions , and never more so than when one goes afield and would be free as may be from hand-baggage , which , even of the lightest sort , has a way of growing into a grievous burden as the hours pass on .

		Realizing this circumstance , Mr.
F. Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	has conferred a veritable boon upon botanical collectors by so shaping his '' Field - Book of American Wild Flowers '' that when not in use it can be stowed away in a side - pocket and happily forgotten .

		But the book can boast of still higher qualities .

		It is writ - ten in plain English : that is , the Greek and Latin terms which make botany literally a science of hard words are almost wholly avoided , and their place is supplied by the simple Ian - guage to which we are all accustomed .

		One page of the book is given to written descrip - tions ; the opposite page pictures the plants described , in admirable drawings , occasionally with colors applied .

		Over eight hundred species of our wild flowers are thus delineated , reliev - ing the student of the toil of analysis in order to learn the name and character of the blossom he would identify .

		It is an easy and agreeable method of making friends of the flowers which greet one wherever there is soil enough to carry root and stem and leaf to their culmination .

		It might be called the lazy man 's botany , -- yet it will earn the gratitude of many a thorough worker in its field , who would gladly avail himself of helps that spare him labor and time .

		To those of us whose memory reaches back some decades more or less , there is a double delight in turning over the books which now-a - days come from an ambitious press .

		In the old times little was looked for beyond a plain binding and a sober page in the volumes which claimed our notice and found a place in staid rows on our library shelves .

		What a contrast prevails at the present day !

		The prime appeal is still to the mental verdict , and yet the grati - fication of the eye is the first end sought .

		The assthetic sense is considered , and all that can win its approval is ingeniously attempted .

		Whatever art can devise is now employed to give outward charm to the book that covets our commendation .

		We feel this sensibly in the '' talks about flowers , '' by Mrs.
Frances Theo	PERSON	-
dora Parsons	PERSON	, which she brings out in a new edition , retaining the former name '' According to Season . ''

		One has a prolonged satisfaction in scanning without reading the pages , in dwell - ing upon the pictures alone and marking the refined details which lend them distinction .

		It is a privilege to own such a book for its ar - tistic charm .

		And its contents well deserve their setting .

		They form a sort of flower cal - endar , bringing into prominence the species which peculiarly mark the seasons from winter around to winter again .

		The writer is on in - timate terms with nature , familiar with her varied manifestations , and winning from her many secrets unknown to hasty or casual ob - servers .

		These secrets she imparts to the reader with an easy and confident air that is no small factor in the happy impression her book produces .

		In a series of short , light stories , written for the delectation of young children , the lat - ter are taken out '' Among the
Night People	ORGANIZATION	, '' by their popular entertainer , Mrs.
Clara Dil	PERSON	- lingham
Pierson	PERSON	, to witness the comedies and tragedies which these odd creatures enact while hid by the curtain of the dark .

		All the adven - tures thus brought to light are made known by the animals themselves , who talk to each other in unimpeachable English .

		Cut-worms , fire - flies , wigglers , weasels , raccoons , and the rest , exhibit a play of mental and moral faculties akin to those with which human beings are en - dowed .

		In fact they are simply men , women , and children , masquerading in fur and feathers , wings and claws , to fit the various parts they assume .

		Such tales are amusing , beyond a doubt ; but the question arises if the same pur - pose might not be attained by communicating more truthful ideas of the aims and motives prevailing in the animal world .

		Mrs.
Martha McCulloch	PERSON	-
Williams	PERSON	discloses an astonishing knowledge of the business of agriculture in the chronicles of a countryside to which she has given the title of `` Next to the Ground . ''

		One might reasonably infer that she has had a life-long experience in turning the furrow , in sowing and harvesting crops , and in caring for the animals which are an essential adjunct of the farm .

		Incidentally , birds , insects , and wild animals , which are most intimately associated with the farmer , are included in the careful description .

		Up in the northern part of
Michigan	LOCATION	, thirty years ago , there rested '' a big , broad , beauti - ful sheet of water set down in the very heart of the woods . ''

		The banks were high and clothed with a noble growth of hardwood and evergreen trees ; the water itself was deep and clear , now blue under the cloudless heaven , and now gold as it basked in the sunshine .

		Here an explorer in the unbroken wilderness , captivated with the loveliness of the little lake , brought his family to dwell , and here for years they had for companionship only `` forest neighbors '' who came about them with un - suspecting familiarity and were treated with the kindliness of honest friendship .

		The squir - rels , woodchucks , chipmunks , and porcupines were daily or nightly visitors at the lonely cabin ; while the lynx , the bear , and the deer often ventured into the near vicinity .

		The beavers built their dams in the brooks flowing into the lake , and the loon and other water - fowl swam on its surface , plunged deep below for their diet of fish , and built their nests in its sheltered places .

		The boy growing up amid such isolated surroundings would naturally have many an interesting story to relate of the wild denizens living close about him ; and a store of these has been gathered into a volume by Mr.
William Davenport Hulbert	PERSON	, who was one of the pioneer 's young family settled on the shores of Grlimmerglass lake .

		In his account of his '' Forest Neighbors '' we see the animals as he saw them , in a state of nature , true to their instincts , and alive and intense in every act and impulse ; and we follow their career as he did , glad of their successes and grieved over the misfortunes of the humblest among them .

		Exquisite illustrations make `` The Brook Book , '' by Miss
Mary Rogers Miller	PERSON	, a thing to be coveted .

		The transcripts , in half-tone , of quiet landscapes with the brook always a central feature , are beautiful enough to frame and hang ever in view .

		Beside these there are copious line engravings of much delicacy and refinement .

		The text is a record of the rambles of a naturalist along a brookside in all weathers and at all seasons of the year .

		Everything alive invited her attention .

		The beauty of the scenery rouses her enthusiasm , but her raptures are chiefly expended upon the insects inhabiting the water , and the plants that fringe its borders .

		She is skilful in her discourse about them , withholding full descrip - tions and telling just enough to excite the reader 's wish to know more , and , by following the writer 's example , to find out for himself the facts that are missing in the half-unfolded tale .

		Miss
Miller	PERSON	, as she reveals herself in her researches in the storehouse of nature , has an energetic personality , a vivacious and piquant habit which is a continual stimulant to the spectator .

		A book whose purpose is ethical as well as practical , which combines wisdom with instruc - tion , is that in which Dr.
Clifton F. Hodge	PERSON	, as - sistant professor in
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	,
Worces	PERSON	- ter ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, outlines a system of '' Nature Study and Life , '' having for its express aim the de - velopment of character , of the will to do good , of the power to create happiness .

		`` Nature Study , '' he declares , '' is learning those things in nature that are best worth knowing to the end of doing those things that make life most worth living . ''

		Of first importance are man 's primitive relations to animal and plant life .

		Household pets are the earliest playfellows of the child ; he should therefore begin his course of nature lessons with a study of the dog , the cat , the horse , the toad , the rabbit , the bird , which are daily under his eye , of which he knows something and should know everything that will stimulate his interest and sympathy and extend their service to him in ways of pleasure or of use .

		For the study of plants the author would have the child sow the seed and watch the growth until stem and leaf and flower beget seed in their turn .

		He adopts the motto of Mrs.
Alice Free	PERSON	- man
Palmer	PERSON	, `` Give children large interests and give them young , '' and charges it with a benefi - cent motive for their future benefit . ''

		If the boys of a neighborhood make the raising of peaches and grapes impossible , a better remedy than the jail would be to start them to raising peaches and grapes of their own . ''

		In the study of insects , Dr.
Hodge	PERSON	would have the child take these which are near at hand , -- the fly , the mosquito , the cockroach , the moth , -- and , leav - ing to specialists details of structure and clas - sification , learn its life-history by direct obser - 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, vation .

		The child who has noted the conditions of development in one of the lower animals has gained a dominion over it which will enable him in maturity to subject it to his needs and comfort .

		The mere knowledge attained is a secondary thing .

		Its worth consists in the con - trol it insures over inferior tribes which tend to become a pleasure or a pest to mankind .

		Here - in lies the distinction of Dr.
Hodge	PERSON	's system .

		The child discovers the practical value of the work he is pursuing , and rejoices in it accord - ingly .

		Beauty and utility go hand in hand , and he is willing to toil and sacrifice in order to produce results whereby the good is cherished and the evil is overcome .

		The book is intended largely for teachers or parents , and will be es - teemed by them for its felicitous and compre - hensive suggestions .


Sara A. Hubbard	PERSON	.

		The Book of the Trout .

		* The popularity of the brook trout among American anglers is so thoroughly established that it requires the ceaseless and unstinted beneficence of a paternal government to keep our streams stocked with the speckled fry .

		The deforestation of great tracts of wilderness , and the devastation by fire with resultant destruction of insect life , have brought addi - tional peril to the inhabitants of many a trout stream .

		The pollutions of civilization , from sawdust to sewage , have already spread deso - lation in many an angler 's paradise .

		We fear very much that Mr.
Ehead	PERSON	's book of `` The Speckled Brook Trout '' will only increase the terrors that await poor Salvelinus of the spring-fed streams .

		It will stir the blood of every veteran disciple of Izaak of
Stafford	ORGANIZATION	, and inspire the amateurs to test the charms of the
Beaverkill	LOCATION	.

		The book is the first of a series which is to constitute a '' Li - brary of
Eod	ORGANIZATION	and Gun , '' and it is eminently fitting that the brook trout should receive the place of chief totem in this religion of recre - ation ; for , as the book puts it , -- '' Has he not stimulated a love for nature , made men good , virtuous , and humane ?

		The first object of the editor was to supply general information concerning the brook trout , without technical terms , for the average fisher - man who is interested in angling only as a sport or as a change from the activity of city life and business cares .

		This result is very well achieved in spite of the fact that the book is a series of articles by no less than eight different authors .

		The unity of purpose is well sus - tained throughout , and a comprehensive and well-balanced treatise is the result .

		Mr.
Hal	PERSON	- lock writes a general description of the trout family , and Mr.
Wm. C. Harris	PERSON	speaks from long acquaintance of the habits of this wary fish .

		We fear that neither geologists nor ichthyologists will give wide acceptance to Mr.
Hallock	PERSON	's suggestion that the wide distribution of trout is to be explained by their transit through the limpid waters of an extensive sub - terranean fluvial system .

		Mr.
E. D. T. Cham	PERSON	- bers describes the famous big trout of the Nepigon and
Lake Edward	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Benjamin Kent	PERSON	sets forth the charms of the
Beaverkill	LOCATION	.

		The old Adirondacks , as they were before they fell from the `` estate of fish and solitude '' for which they were originally celebrated , are con - trasted with the new Adirondacks , in which sportsmen 's secrets have become the common - places of the guide-books .

		Mr.
F. Annin , Jr.	PERSON	, details the various winged foes with which the trout must contend for existence , and presents a long list of offenders .

		The other contributors are free to express their views of intruding sawmills , and of farmers who also interfere with the angler 's sport .

		We fear the editor has let pass a good opportunity to set forth in his true light one of the greatest enemies both of the trout and the modest angler , to-wit , the expert who fishes for record and whips out a brook in a single day regardless of the pleasure of others or the maintenance of the sport .

		A chapter by the late
A. Nelson Cheney	PERSON	, on the propagation of trout , is reprinted from the re - port of the
New York	LOCATION	commissioners ; and some notes on cooking brook trout are furnished by the editor .

		The book is tastefully contrived from cover to tail-piece .

		Some inserted cuts in green tints add further novelty to the book .

		The publisher has spared neither pains nor expense to give this initial volume of his sportsman 's library an attractive and fitting setting .

		Recent Fiction .

		* The instinct of hero-worship is a fine psycholog - ical possession when restrained by a due regard for truth .

		There are no heroes without their faults , and we need to have the robust faith which accepts a hero , faults and all , without blinking , if our cult is to gain converts .

		When misdeeds are glazed by the worshipper , and the unlovely aspects of char - acter concealed , the portrait drawn is not convincing , and its effect is not what the artist intends .

		We have styled '' The Con - queror '' a sort of historical novel because , while largely fictitious , it reads like serious history .

		The writer says that she at first thought of writing a formal biography of
Hamilton	LOCATION	, but '' the instinct of the novelist proved too strong '' to be overcome .

		The actual result of her efforts is a hybrid product that is not easily classified .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	has studied the sources widely if not wisely , but the resulting product is a turgid and amorphous piece of writing , absolutely hopeless in the matter of style , as well as insuffer - ably dull .

		The historical student will find in it entertainment of a sort that the writer did not in - tend to provide , but the general reader will do well to pass it by . ''

		The Battleground '' is the fourth novel of Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	, and is much the best of the four .

		Indeed , it seems to us one of the best novels of the South during the period which precedes and includes the Civil War that has ever been written .

		The generous qualities and the amiable weaknesses that make the
Virginia	LOCATION	life of a generation ago so charm - ing to us in the retrospect are pictured with sym - pathetic insight , and the horrors of internecine conflict are softened into pathetic outline by the art of the writer .

		The broad hospitality , the essential refinement , the semi-feudal social organization , and the high-minded idealism of the Old Dominion in ante-bellum days , are now ♦ vanished forever from our civilization , or exist in out-of-the-way regions as faint simulacra of a past that now seems as old as the Flood .

		We have organized our life upon a more rational basis , perhaps , but much has been lost that may never be regained , and one sometimes wonders if the change has been altogether for the better .

		This book might have been called '' The Making of a Man , '' for that is what provides its main interest , and we care more for the develop - ment of the hero 's character under the stress of sternly adverse circumstance than we do for the picturesque accessories of the narrative .

		The war itself is excellently done , but even more excellent is the art with which its reactions upon the several leading characters are set forth .

		Such books as this help us to respect the Southern standpoint , and help also to wipe away the last lingering traces of Northern resentment .

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, chosen for her field the wild days of adventure in the Canadian wilderness , the days when the far - trade was a source of great wealth to those who exploited it , and when the rivalries of English and French for its monopoly led to many moving inci - dents by flood and forest .

		Miss Laut 's '' Lords of the North '' was a work of much freshness and crude power , and its present successor , `` Heralds of Empire , '' marks a still more evident success .

		That picturesque and fascinating dare-devil ,
Pierre Radisson	PERSON	, is the hero of the new romance , which connects , on the one hand , with the English court of the Restoration , and , on the other , with the colony of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	just before the days of the witchcraft delusion .

		We are plunged into the thick of the witchcraft delusion when we take up `` The Coast of Freedom , '' by Miss
Marie Adele Shaw	PERSON	.

		The scene of this ro - mance begins at the
London	LOCATION	docks , with the kidnap - ping of a maid whom certain villainous persons wish to put out of the way that they may gain possession of her property .

		The scene then shifts -LRB- after a piratical episode -RRB- to the
New England	LOCATION	colony , whither the heroine is brought under the guardian - ship of Captain
William Phips	PERSON	.

		The arch-villain also appears to ornament
Boston	LOCATION	society , and prose - cute his designs .

		A suitable hero is provided , and , after many perils , both hero and heroine reach the haven of their desires .

		The leading historical fig - ures are those of Phips , now governor of the colony , and
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, in his favorite character of witch-hunter .

		It is probably useless to protest , in the name of historical scholarship , against this dis - tortion of a great
New England	LOCATION	worthy .

		The scene of the heroine 's trial for witchcraft is well done , much better than it has been done in earlier treat - ments of this theme , and the general atmosphere of
Puritan Massachusetts	LOCATION	has been reproduced with considerable skill and fidelity to fact .

		Mr.
Wymond Carey	PERSON	is a new writer , as far as we know , and the quality of his `` Monsieur
Martin	PERSON	'' is such that we shall hope to hear from him again .

		The book is a full-blooded historical romance of the great Swedish war , with
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		for the leading historical figure , and Augustus the Strong for a side-show .

		A scene is divided between
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Dresden	LOCATION	, and the interest is sustained at stir - ring pitch throughout an exceptionally long narra - tive .

		The intrigue is so complicated that we follow it with difficulty , and even at the end are not quite sure of what the author would have us think of several of his characters .

		This is the one defect of a book which has many virtues .

		It is the product of a rich mind and an inventive one , of a writer who has really delved into the history of his period , and who at the same time knows how to make skil - ful use of all the romantic accessories .

		It is a novel of action from first to last , and spares us the pages of description and analysis with which most histor - ical romances are apt to eke out the poverty of their imagination .

		The romantic career of
John Law	ORGANIZATION	has been made into a historical novel by Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	, who has found ample material for his exploitation in the experiences of this fascinating adventurer .

		Roughly divided , the story has three sections , deal - ing , respectirely , with Law 's startling entry into
London	LOCATION	society , with his subsequent exploration of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, and with his dazzling fame and sudden downfall under the French Regency .

		His life offers an excellent subject for romance , and the author has made much of it .

		The specu - lative fever which attended the launching of his great financial enterprises , his conquest of court and capital , and the dramatic climax of his down -
fall	DATE	, are vividly set forth , and inspire no little sympathy for a man who , although he made mis - calculations , was nevertheless distinctly in advance of his age . ''

		The Siege of Lady Resolute , '' by Mr.
Harris Dickson	PERSON	, is a historical romance which , like the one last described , divides its scenes between
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		It begins in
Southern France	LOCATION	, with the persecution of the C ^ venol Huguenots , carries us on through much intrigue in and about the court of Louis XIV. , and depicts the sinister ascendency of
Madame de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Presently the action is shifted to the new colony of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, whither hero and heroine are conveniently transported , and where they encounter much peril from both red men and white .

		We return to
France	LOCATION	at last , and the Lady Resolute capitulates , which means that there is no further excuse for prolonging the story .

		The latest of Revolutionary romances is '' None but the Brave , '' by Mr.
Hamblen Sears	PERSON	.

		The scene is laid in the
Hudson	LOCATION	region , from
West Point	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	, and the time is that of
Arnold	LOCATION	's treason and the immediately subsequent happenings .

		The figures are of the conventional sort .

		The hero is daring and devoted ; the heroine begins by being pert and ends by becoming womanly ;
Washington	LOCATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, Andr ^ ,
Clinton	PERSON	, and other historical per - sonages make also their conventional albeit shadowy entry upon the scene .

		The villain is disposed of in somewhat unusual fashion , and all ends happily .

		The history of the last century offers no subject for the historical novelist more fascinating in its interest and more striking in its dramatic possibilities than the war of
1870	DATE	between
France	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		A number of writers have made successful use of this theme .

		It has been happily handled by
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	in his '' Allzeit Voran , '' by Mr.
R. W. Chambers	PERSON	in his `` Lorraine , '' and by countless French novelists of the
past quarter	DATE	- century .

		This is no reason why it should not be handled again , and we are glad that Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has taken it for the subject-matter of his latest novel .

		We are glad , not only because of the perennial in - terest of the theme , but also because it has given this writer an opportunity for the display of talents that could not possibly find fitting exercise in the drawing-room .

		The smartness of an artificial so - ciety has been his chief preoccupation in his earlier novels , and he has cared more for the polishing of
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 a phrase than for the delineation of a vital situation .

		Epigram and light social banter are not wholly missing in '' The Crinason Wing , '' but there is serious stuff besides .

		It is all a little theatrical and senti - mental still , but it is a well-planned story , and it is based upon a really painstaking effort to be his - torically accurate .

		It is a far better book than the author has heretofore given us , and promises well for his literary future . ''

		Before the Dawn , '' a novel by Mr. and Mrs.
Edmund Noble	PERSON	, deals with the beginnings of the modern revolutionary movement in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The scene is laid somewhere in the early seventies , when Nihilism was on the point of blossoming into the red flower of terrorism , and when the ferment of liberal ideas was spreading from many small groups of young men and women .

		The authors know their
Russia	LOCATION	too well to be guilty of going to sensational extremes , and the lurid episodes usually found in stories of this description are wanting .

		There are arrests , indeed , and sentences of administrative exile , but we are spared the horrors of dungeons and assassinations .

		The book is valuable as a picture of social conditions , bat it does not make a good novel .

		The action is impeded by much description and discussion , and even the plot is difficult to dis - entangle .

		We have at the end only a confused idea of the principal characters and of the relations in which the authors have sought to place them .

		The '' epic '' effect seems in danger of being over - strained by our novelists .

		One of them gives us the epic of the wheat and promises the epic of the board of trade , another gives us the epic of the rolling-mills , and still another the epic of the cow - boy ; now Mr.
Stewart Edward White	PERSON	appears with '' The Blazed Trail , '' which is the epic of the log - ging camp .

		These books all testify to the tremen - dous energy which is the secret of our material advancement , and doubtless help the cloistered reader to understand the conditions of the turbulent life that environs him .

		But they make rather dull reading , because their chief stock in trade is a fund of technical information about some particular in - dustry , which can not be accepted as a proper sub - stitute for insight into the human soul .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's book is among the better of its class , but it is heavily overweighted with minute realistic description , and the relief afforded by a few sentimental episodes and rhapsodical outbursts is too artificial and perfunctory to prove satisfactory .

		Those who want to know about logging in
Upper Michigan	LOCATION	, and about the frauds upon the government committed by the lumberman-capitalist , will find these things expressed with virile energy in '' The Blazed Trail , '' but they will find little more .

		Least of all will they find the elements of convincing or even probable romance , unless the meaning of romance be frankly adapted to fit the case .

		Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	has produced a capital story in `` The Captain of the Gray Horse Troop . ''

		It is a story of love and adventure on a Western Indian reservation , with an excursion or two into the haunts of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	politician .

		It has a hero of the most attractive metal , sincere and courageous , and a heroine who charms not the hero alone .

		It has moving incidents in profusion , and opportunities for the display of both moral and physical prowess .

		It has descriptive power also , and a charm of style beyond what Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has hitherto attained .

		It is , moreover , a book which makes an impressive appeal in behalf of a cause which has clearly en - listed the author 's most ardent sympathies -- the cause of the American Indian .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has been apt to let his interest in causes get the better of his artistic judgment , but in this case he has made a book which does not suffer in romantic in terest from the obtrusion of the underlying argu ment .

		With less of sentimentality and a firmer grasp of actual conditions than were possessed by the author of ''
Ramona	PERSON	, '' he has made an even more convincing plea for the rights of our national wards , and has voiced an equal indignation at sight of the tricks and abuses that we have allowed to be put upon them , at our wanton provocations and punitive expeditions , and at the folly of the effort to impose our own civilization upon a people who are still living in the Stone Age . ''

		The Captain of the Gray Horse Troop '' is a well-informed and warm-hearted book , that is good to read , and is likely to prove an effective ally in the work of dealing justly and humanely with the Indians .

		The delicate art of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has never been displayed to better advantage than in his latest novel . ''

		The Kentons '' is the kind of story best suited to his powers , a story of commonplace people in commonplace relations .

		The characters are the six Kentons -- father , mother , two daugh - ters , and two sons -- and the various young men who are interested in the daughters .

		They live in an
Ohio	LOCATION	town of five thousand inhabitants , and enjoy universal respect .

		Muskingum , however , does not long contain them , as far as the present story is concerned , for one of the daughters gets into an entanglement of the affections with a vulgar youth of the town , and is broken-hearted when she real - izes his unworthiness .

		To distract her , the family make a visit to
New York	LOCATION	, and thence s ^ , art upon a European trip .

		The objective point is
Holland	LOCATION	^ and the scene from that time on is laid in the
Hague	LOCATION	and in
Scheveningen	LOCATION	.

		A young
New York	LOCATION	clergy - man of the liberal and humane type is among their fellow-passengers ; he accompanies them to the
Hague	LOCATION	, and , in the end , persuades the broken - hearted daughter to become his wife .

		These charac - ters are drawn for us with lines so deft and so subtle that we can think of no truer parallel than the work of
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		In addition , there is much variety of incident , and the constant infusion of the sly humor which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	always has at command .

		The heroine is a young woman with an exasperating conscience , which we all the time fear will compel her to a rash decision , reckless of her own inter - ests .

		Fortunately , her fundamental good sense triumphs over the casuistry of her introspective 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, heart-searchings , and the situation is brought to a rational outcome .

		The perplexities of the story are of the artificial sort , and in the hands of the ordinary novelist such a story could not be any - thing but dull .

		To say that it remains absorbingly interesting is the best tribute that we can pay to the art of the writer .

		Religious controversy in a small
New York	LOCATION	town is the substance of ''
Hardwicke	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Henry Edward Rood	PERSON	.

		This is not a promising programme , but the treatment offers a sufficient modicum of variety and humor to reconcile us in the end with so forbidding a theme .

		The principal character is a young clergyman , whose faith in the fundamentals of Christian belief is unshaken , but who has read and thought too much to have any sympathy with the narrow and intolerant orthodoxy of the past .

		In accepting his village charge he finds himself a member of a community bound hard and fast in the trammels of a mechanical and repellant faith .

		His opinions quickly arouse suspicion , and he finds himself , after a few weeks , the victim of an old - fashioned heretic hunt , with the whole village pack at his heels .

		The plot of his enemies to dismiss him in disgrace is shrewdly circumvented , and he with - draws voluntarily with most of the honors of the game , including the daughter of his most virulent antagonist .

		The story is rather amateurish , the violence of the attack upon the hero is somewhat exaggerated , and certain minor features of the plot are not sufficiently developed , but the book is never - theless possessed of both interest and promise .

		A young man of fine intellectual and moral en - dowment , entering upon active life with all the advantages of wealth and education , resolves , rather than follow the easy path of worldly success that invites him , to cast in his lot with the poor and make their cause his own .

		He first enters the ministry , but is soon repelled by the hypocrisies of the profession , and decides to become one of the people by engaging as a common workman in a great iron and steel industry .

		With this purpose in view he enters the works of an establishment , makes his way into a position of some responsibility , and at the same time becomes a trusted leader of his fellow-workmen in their agitation for the redress of grievances .

		In the strike which ensues , he en - deavors to mediate between the conflicting interests , but stands staunchly for the claims of labor in its conflict with capital .

		The angry passions which he has helped to unloose escape from his control , and there follows the familiar and sickening sequence of violent attacks upon property and persons , stern repression by the authorities , and punishment of the offenders .

		Having made his experiment , and found it a failure , he returns to the life which he had abandoned , not hopeless of his cause , but con - scious that he had sought to further it by means that must be foredoomed to failure .

		Henceforth , he will work for his ideal of the cooperative com - monwealth from the vantage-point of the social station to which he really belongs .

		The story is a familiar one ; once started , it almost tells itself ; in relating it anew , Mr.
I. K. Friedman	PERSON	has followed the inevitable lines .

		But '' By Bread Alone '' is distinguished from most of the stories of its class by a patient first-hand study of the conditions of the problem , by passionate earnestness , and by perfect sincerity .

		These qualities have their defects , which in the present instance take the form of too much technology and a seriousness too unre - lieved .

		Those who are familiar with industrial conditions in the great iron mills of
Chicago	LOCATION	will applaud the faithfulness of their portrayal , and those who remember the incidents of the riots of the
summer of 1894	DATE	will admire the ingenuity with which Mr.
Friedman	PERSON	has made use of material drawn from its history .

		His reproduction of the happenings of that
summer	DATE	is so accurate in many of its details that there is danger of its being taken too literally in others .

		In this respect , an unin - tentional injustice is done the memory of a recent governor of
Illinois	LOCATION	, whose real attitude in the matter was that of unflinching determination to sustain the law , rather thtjb that sympathy with lawlessness which has beedr ^ harged to him by his enemies .

		We regret that Mr.
Friedman	PERSON	's book should help to perpetuate so malicious and un - grounded a legend . ''

		The Second Generation , '' by Mr.
James Weber Linn	PERSON	, is the first book of a youfng writer , who has done wisely in dealing with life as it lies close at hand .

		It is a study of the modern American city viewed by a student of corrupt political conditions , and pictures the career of an unscrupulous manip - ulator of legislative bodies and organs of opihilfl ^ To the undoing of this scoundrel a young reporter ^ devotes his energies , and achieves success in his aim , although the caprice of fortune makes him the victim of an unjust criminal prosecution .

		With the daughter of this man , ignorant of her parentage , he has fallen in love , and thus the outcome of the story is a sort of tragedy .

		Mr.
Linn	PERSON	has written a creditable story , one which has interest in itself , and which gives promise of better things to come .

		`` Catholic controversy in fiction '' -- the adver - tisement is not alluring , but it is at | least honest .

		Three books constitute the series , and one of them we reviewed several weeks ago . ''

		The Catholic '' is an anonymous novel , dealing with contemporary English life .

		The form of worship , about which the characters and incidents are grouped , seems to have no relation whatever to any form of religious emotion .

		It is a hard and unlovely polity , seeking to extend its power by worldly influence and in - trigue , by an appeal to the baser motives of human action .

		There is not a character in the book that may be called sympathetic , nor an ambition that may be called praiseworthy .

		If the writer be indeed a member of the Roman communion , his method is certainly a curious one .

		The best of ecclesiastical organizations have vices that are in need of scourging , but the role of the candid friend may easily be overacted .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	, whose '' Casting of Nets '' we mentioned before , has now added '' A Roman Mystery '' to the series .

		His second book is much better than the first , which we condemned on much the same grounds as have just been urged in the case of '' The Catholic . ''

		It has no more of spir - ituality than its predecessor , and it gives disagree - able prominence to the intriguing and proselytizing aspects of Catholic society , but it deals with inter - esting material , and is the work of a man who knows his subject .

		That subject is , essentially , the feud between `` whites '' and `` blacks '' in Roman society , of which Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has given us many interesting glimpses , and which Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	has studied with judgment and penetration .

		His book is a brief for the liberals , and an unanswerable argument for the renunciation of papal pretensions to the temporal power .

		Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	would have done well to adhere to his earlier resolution , and allow
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	to '' stay dead . ''

		The resurrection was hardly worth while if it was to result in so hackneyed a repetition of the old mannerisms and methods of the detective as is given us in '' The Hound of the Baskervilles . ''

		The plot is ingeniously contrived , to be sure , and the working out is of a nature to keep the reader keyed up to a reasonable pitch of exciting suspense , but the conclusion is not adequate to the machinery employed , and the entire performance is hopelessly melodramatic .

		When we think of the really good books that Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	wrote at the outset of his career , and then contrast them with this journeyman effort , the showing is melancholy indeed .

		`` The Giant 's Gate , '' Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	's latest injjention , is a romance of modern
Paris	LOCATION	inspired by suggestions of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair , and partly by reminiscences of the meteoric General
Boulanger	PERSON	.

		What the author needed was a '' man on horseback , '' the idol of the populace , and , since the more recent ■ chapter in French history failed to provide such a figure , recourse was had to the earlier one .

		A coup d'Stat is planned , and gives promise of successful issue , but the
Government	ORGANIZATION	thwarts the conspirators at the critical juncture , and the hero occupies Bel - fort instead of the Elyede .

		The heroine is the daughter of an English earl , and , at the end , is left awaiting the release of her lover from the place of his imprisonment .

		The story is brilliant but artifi - cial , and , what is unusual with this novelist , is badly constructed .

		The '' giant 's gate '' is the Thames , and the whole tenor of the earlier chapters seems to promise a French invasion of
England	LOCATION	by means of a fleet of submarines .

		About midway in the narra - tive , the plot gets sidetracked , as it were , and from there on becomes an account of the hero 's imperial escapade .

		A curious thing about the book is that , in dealing with its English scenes and persons , it as - sumes the French standpoint , and indulges in the sort of caricature which is the delight of the Par - isian journalist .

		We can not help wondering how Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's public will take this audacious proceeding .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NOVELS .

		Mr.
Brand Whitlock	PERSON	was long a political corres - pondent for one of the leading newspapers in the coun - try .

		During his period of service he obtained an insight into the practical side of government which is granted to few of his fellow-citizens .

		This he has utilized to the utmost in his novel , '' The Thirteenth District '' -LRB-
Bowen-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		But he has not rested content with the mere idealizing and narration of events from his own experience .

		Singularly happy as he has been in selecting characters who are types of the con - tending forces ruling the destinies of the Republic , he has been still happier in making his principal character , a pitiful creature to call a hero , the battle-ground on which the forces of good and evil contend .

		The de - moralizing effects of power in weak hands , of life in the capital of the nation upon a character far from robust , of the temptations which assail the man in public life , these are what give Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	's work its interest and its promise of permanency .

		Politics of quite another sort gives interest to Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's initial tale in '' The Making of a Statesman , and Other Stories '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Here a young man of talent and high ambitions sacrifices his own career to put the father of the girl he loves into a place of honor , -- writing his speeches , teaching him to deliver them , and conducting the cam - paigns that bring him before the public .

		Before it is quite too late , though after the supposed statesman 's death , the lover 's self-sacrifice becomes known to the daughter , and a pleasant story is given its appropriate ending .

		There are three other tales in the book , of the sort that Mr.
Harris	PERSON	has made his readers familiar with in his previous publications , with well-drawn characters from the South , and events filled with human interest .

		In the general search for literary material now going on in
America	LOCATION	, the South is by no means overlooked .

		Mr.
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	, Jr. , takes the Reconstruction era for the topic of his rather ill-natured work , '' The Leopard 's Spots '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author states Ag & in and again that the bittei ^ ness against the North is due more to the excesses of the '' carpet - hag '' epoch than to the deeds of the Civil War .

		He is full of hatred against the negro , who was rather the tool in the hands of designing whites than an actor on his own responsibility in the scenes complained of .

		Yet his book will not have been written in vain if it points out the dangers of ruling a people against its will , the awful perils of governing without the consent of the governed .

		A book more just to both
North and South	LOCATION	is Mrs.
Mary Tappan Wright	PERSON	's '' Aliens '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		A Northern man , long acclimated in the South through his service as professor in a small college , marries a Northern woman with all the virtues and prejudices of the intelligent
American of New England	ORGANIZATION	birth and breeding .

		She brings to her understanding of the negro question a keen sense of justice and an inexor - able conscience .

		Opposed to her is the inertia of a people who have learned from bitter experience what she has seen with unfamiliar eyes .

		The right and wrong of the case , the slow dawning of the vital dis - tinction between a condition and a theory , are set forth with dispassion and a keen sense of justice to the con - tending forces at work .

		It is doubtful if the multiform problem presented by the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	negro has ever been 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, discussed in a manner more enlightened and with observation more acute .

		It is not in the `` black belt '' of the South that
Miss Hildegard Brooks	PERSON	lays the scene of '' The Master of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a story which concerns itself chiefly with social distinctions between the whites .

		A Southern girl , adopted by a woman of wealth in the North , abandons her heritage after the death of her benefactress , in part because of the burdens attached to it , but more from homesickness .

		She thenceforth makes her home with the three brothers she had never forgotten , young men with all the dignity of free Ameri - cans , though by no means of the aristocracy of their little corner in the world .

		A double romance runs through the story thenceforth , lending interest and va - riety to its well-drawn pictures of manners and customs . ''

		Dorothy South '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- takes its name from a beautiful young Southern woman , one of the most agreeable characters Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	has ever painted .

		The period is that immediately preceding the Civil War , and the story is concerned chiefly with the differences and contrasts between life in the South now and in the ante-bellum days .

		Still another aspect of Southern life is contained in '' Mazel '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , written by an author who shields his identity behind the pen-name of * •
Richard Fisguill	PERSON	. ''

		The scene is laid in the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, and the close approximation to actual portraits of the members of the faculty of that excellent institution will account for the practical anonymity with which the book is put forth .

		Mr.
Samuel Minturn Peck	PERSON	is at his best in the series of little stories which make up the volume of '' Ala - bama Sketches '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		He has drawn upon all the elements of a cheerful little city for his characters , and his work lacks neither humor nor pathos .

		Whites and blacks mingle in his pages on terms of equal liter - ary importance , whatever their social status may be .

		While slight , the tales , some of them little more than anecdotes , have positive charm , and may be taken as accurate pictures of a civilization but little known in the
North	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Paul	PERSON	.

		Dunbar has done nothing as good in prose as his latest story , '' The Sport of the Gods '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A faithful negro is accused of a crime of which his master 's weak brother is guilty , and is sentenced to a long term of imprisonment .

		His family , denied the right of support through popular prejudice , takes refuge in
New York City	LOCATION	, and proceeds to speedy moral disintegration .

		Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	gives a side of met - ropolitan life almost unsuspected , -- that of the dissi - pated colored folk , frequenters of saloons and cheap theatres .

		The story is at once tenderly sympathetic and powerful , and nothing written recently presents a more impressive picture of the evil results which fol - low a betrayal of justice .

		Nearly all the characters of Mr.
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	's '' Many Waters '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- are
New York	LOCATION	journalists , and those who seek knowledge of one of the few mod - ern occupations which have in them the spirit of adven - ture can find it set forth here in full detail .

		Episodes in newspaper life are to be seen from the inside , coupled with a pretty romance and an excellently contrived foil to it through the wrecking of a husband 's life by an unfaithful wife .

		The book is vivid and convincing , and has a really remarkable first chapter .

		The city policeman , one of the most maligned and least understood of all our public servants , finds a sym - pathetic interpreter in Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	Flower . ''

		Police - man
Flynn	PERSON	, '' the hero of his book , is an actuality in the main , based upon the long career of uninterrupted use - fulness led by the late
Andrew Rowan	PERSON	of the
Central Detail	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Flower	PERSON	lets us see what it means to be both a man and an officer , in a series of sketches , humorous in the main , though always with a suspicion of pathos .

		The book is eminently modern , and one to be read for instruction hardly less than amusement .

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Not the least remarkable thing about
Mark Twain	PERSON	's '' Double-Barrelled Detective Story '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- is the introduction into the book of Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's ''
Sher	PERSON	- lock Holmes '' as a living character , -- just at the mo - ment , too , when his creator had resuscitated him .

		The story , which is slight , promises well in the opening chap - ters , but it may be said not to be worked out , and leaves the reader disappointed .

		An interesting character is preserved in Mr.
Herbert M. Hopkins	PERSON	's `` The Fighting Bishop '' -LRB-
Bo wen-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a portrait of a pro-slavery prelate in war times , disclosing the effect of his powerful personality upon the members of his large family .

		There are two love episodes in the book , one of much sweetness ; but the theme is rather the manner in which son after son of the aging man is crushed into insignificance under his dominion .

		Some rebel and flee , some dare to differ from him politically , even his wife turns to save her offspring from the terror of his wrath ; while the old dignitary , abating no whit of his demand for obedience , goes on his way lonely and sorrowful .

		For a first book , it has marked originality .

		As a result of his studies of the American tramp , Mr.
Josiah Flynt	PERSON	has written a novel dealing with a spe - cial phase in the lives of these victims and enemies of society . ''

		The Little Brother '' -LRB- Century Co -RRB- is not pleasant in text or suggestion , but it demands a meas - ure of social justice that shall free the community of these parasites by destroying the reason for their exist - ence .

		Here a child is kidnapped from his putative sister , actually his mother , and the kidnapper proves in the end to be the lad 's own father .

		A chapter , drawn from life , of the effect of jail-life upon the boy , reads like a cry for help from these helpless ones .

		The mining region of
Arizona	LOCATION	has furnished Miss
Frances Charles	PERSON	with the material for her rather unus - ual story , '' In the Country God Forgot '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		On this rude spot the civilizations of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast meet the customs of the remote
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, with effects at once humorous and tragic .

		In the background stands the gloomy figure of a pio - neer , owner of all the neighboring lands and interests not wholly mineral , who has in his heart a most unhappy hatred for his only child , a son .

		The book can hardly be said to be composed of successive episodes , and yet the bond between the chapters is often slight , making it difficult to hold the thread of the argument .

		New England humor may grow tiresome when strained through the medium of much dialect , so that the better part of Mr.
Fred Lewis Pattee	PERSON	's ''
Mary Gar	PERSON	- vin : The Story of a New Hampshire Summer '' -LRB- Crow - ell -RRB- lies rather in the awakening of soul which comes to the heroine , at first through her growing affection for a man of education , a neighbor 's son , who has sought and found a position at the bar , and then in the abrupt - ness of her own contrast with the personality of a charming city woman looking for a rural retreat .

		Be - tween the two influences , she comes into contact with
1902	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 the great world , goes to school , -- and the end is inev - itable , but all the better for coming after a good old - fashioned New England Thanksgiving dinner .

		There are few writers more entertaining to-day than Miss
Josephine Dodge Daskam	PERSON	, and her previous rep - utation loses nothing by the stories of childhood pub - lished under the title of the first of them , '' The Mad - ness of Philip '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Miss
Daskam	PERSON	has been at no little pains to present aspects of child-life which are typical , and to the adult unusu - ally instructive .

		She has fully realized in her book that children have ideas and standards of their own , and has been fortunate in making this fact clear to her readers .

		It is a rare story that can bring amusement to both old and young in a single audience .

		A child of a larger growth is the heroine of Miss
Eleanor Hoyt	PERSON	's '' The Misdemeanors of Nancy '' -LRB- Dou - bleday ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Nancy is a girl just old enough to be in society , pretty , charming , acute , and vivacious , and with entire consciousness of the privileges these qualities entitle her to exact from the world at large and from the masculine element in it more particularly .

		The book is admirable
summer	DATE	reading , being con - structed in episodes , each complete in itself , yet com - bining to give an accurate portrait of a delightful personality .

		````
Chimmie Fadden	PERSON	and Mr
Paul	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- revives interest in an old acquaintance , the '' Bowery boy , '' promoted to service in a
New York	LOCATION	family of position and wealth .

		All the characters of the former volume have been retained by Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	, the author , but the opinions set forth in the book are largely those of Mr.
Paul	PERSON	, intimate in the
Van Cort	LOCATION	- landt-Burton household .

		Strained as these are through
Chimmie	ORGANIZATION	's marvellous dialect , the effect is usually de - lightful if the ability to comprehend this picturesque manner of expression is not lacking .

		But the notable thing in the book is the social and political philosophy , quite as good and quite as sound in its way as Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	's , and of the same school .

		Of the making of historical romances there is appar - ently no end , but if all of these could have the fire and accuracy of Mr.
Clinton ScoUard	PERSON	's '' The Cloistering of Ursula '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- there would be noth - ing to complain of .

		The scene is laid in one of the Italian cities during the Renaissance , and the opening chapter is certain to engage the reader 's attention , for the hero 's whole family perishes in a single massacre .

		From that time on there is no diminution of interest , love stepping in when battle and murder is not holding the stage .

		It is an accurate picture of the times , ad - mirably written , and well illustrated .

		Going back to the days of the Emperor Barbarossa for the scene of '' HohenzoUern , '' the Very Rev.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	has drawn upon his imagination for the rest of his characters .

		The book is written for dramatization , and as a result it suffers as literature , the action being too incessant and the proportion which diologue bears to narrative much too large .

		The story is based upon the rivalry between
Barbarossa	ORGANIZATION	and HohenzoUern for the affections of a lady of the court , and contains material enough for one twice its length .

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Coming down to the conspiracy of Fontiac , Mrs.
Mary Catherine Crowley	PERSON	writes of '' The Heroine of the Strait '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , setting forth the incidents of the siege of
Detroit	LOCATION	by that interesting and unscrupulous savage .

		The principal figure in the book is a pretty French girl who is said to have saved the English garrison from overthrow , in spite of his - torical evidence that it was an Indian maiden who be - trayed the purpose of her people .

		The story could not fail to be interesting with so much action and no less romance running through it , and contrives to give a vivid conception of the troubles with which the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, so peaceful now , was afflicted through more than a century .

		It is in another corner of the country that
Annie T. Colcock	PERSON	lands her heroine in ''
Margaret Tudor	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , -- at
St. Augustine	LOCATION	in
the latter half of the seventeenth century	DATE	, when the Spaniards were in con - trol .

		A beautiful English girl is captured with her shipmates , and her troubles begin with the infatuation for her which springs up in the heart of one of the Spanish officials .

		The story is both short and slight , an escape soon throwing
Margaret	PERSON	back into the arms of her English lover .

		The most unfortunate island of
Martinique	LOCATION	is the scene of the later chapters in Mrs.
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	's '' The Prince Incognito '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , a prince of the royal family of
Parma	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	being the pro- tagonist .

		He has married in due religious form , but entirely without the law of the land , the daughter of a Huguenot preacher , and she escapes with him to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, disguised as a cabin boy .

		The story is told with much simplicity and sense of reality , reading rather as veracious history than as fiction .


Daniel Boone	PERSON	is the central figure of Mrs.
Lucy Cleaver McElroy	PERSON	's '' The Silent Pioneer '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , though the historical interest of it is subordinated to the account of the simple , hard , and primitive life of the early settlers in
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		There are Indians , of course , and they are rather the conventional redskins of
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	than those of Mr , Gar - land 's last book , for example .

		Though the love story in the book makes its appeal to grown folk , boys will find this tale well worth their attention .

		Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett	PERSON	's latest novel , '' The Methods of Lady Walderhurst '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , is a sequel to '' The Making of a Marchioness , '' published less than a year ago .

		In it the life of the former Miss
Emily Fox-Seton	PERSON	is continued , and the same kindliness of heart and devoted gratitude which made her a mod - ern Patient Grizel remains hers after her marriage to the right honorable marquis .

		In spite of the sensationalism inherent in the narrative , the book is made calm and dignified by Lady
Walderhurst	ORGANIZATION	's admirable disposition .

		Like its predecessors from the same hand , Mr.
Bram Stoker	PERSON	's '' The Mystery of the Sea '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a bit of glowing melodrama , with hidden treasure , desperate villains , secret passages in ancient castles , abductions , shipwrecks , Spanish dons , old women with the gift of second-sight , and other un - usual elements of interest .

		It would be hard to get more action , or more kinds of action , between the covers of a book than will be found here ; and it can be depended upon to keep one awake o ' nights .

		Idyllic with the breath of the Irish uplands in its pages , ''
Patricia	PERSON	of the Hills '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a meritor - ious tale of the life which a selfish old spendthrift of a father forces upon his charming daughter when he learns that her voice can be coined into gold .

		Two lovers stand ready to take her from what she conceives to be her duty , and the device to which the author , Mr.
C. K. Burrow	PERSON	, resorts to leave the field clear for the better of them is the least satisfactory thing in the 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, book .

		Especially to be commended is the portrait of
Patricia	LOCATION	's uncle , the priest of the parish where all the action takes place apart from the brief stay in
London	LOCATION	.

		The title • * Scarlet and Hyssop '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- suits Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	's last story of fashionable life in
Loudon	LOCATION	admirably .

		A noble lord deeply resents the attention paid his wife by a former admirer of hers , who returns to
England	LOCATION	rich after the exile he had im - posed on himself at the time of her marriage .

		At the same time the husband carries on something more than a flirtation with one of his wife 's acquaintances .

		The theme is wifely duty , and the awakening of love after a conventional marriage ; and , like all Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's novels , the story is well written .

		Nothing written in recent years has so inexhaustible a vein of irrepressible humor running through it as the last volume from the pen of Mr.
W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	, '' At Sunwich Port '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In it , too , Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	demonstrates his ability to carry on a sustained narra - tive , his book concerning itself with the lives of three young people , from their '' joyful schooldays '' up to the point of marriage -- or escape from it , as the case may be .

		One central figure , father of the heroine and minor hero , is a foil to the keen sense of humor which dominates the words and actions of everyone else , and the entire series of situations is designed with a keen knowledge of fictional art .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	has surpassed his `` Lin McLean '' in another novel of the Western plains , `` The Virgin - ian '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the hero being a
Wyoming	LOCATION	'' cow - puncher '' and the heroine a nice little '' Yankee school - ma'am '' -- the lineal descendant of Molly Stark -- who flees from an importunate suitor , and family press - ure to marry a man she does not love , out to freedom amid the cattle - ranges of the Far West .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's intimate knowledge of his subject enables him to draw a figure of a typical plainsman in this transplanted Southerner , and the story is one which comes near to the heart of essential Americanism . ''

		When Love is King '' -LRB-
Fenno	PERSON	-RRB- is a novel of some - what confused purposes , written by Mr.
W. Dudley Mabry	PERSON	, It deals at the outset with the woes of child - hood and the betrayal of a widow left with a single child , a daughter , by a Christian minister .

		Later this same scoundrel attempts to wreck the career of a bro - ther clergyman through envy at his success , the scene transferring itself from the
Middle West	LOCATION	to the min - ing regions of the
Sierras	LOCATION	.

		At the close it becomes known that the preacher who was brought so near to ruin was the son of his malicious rival ; vice is duly re - buked , and virtue rewarded .

		It is an artless tale .

		Mr.
Willis George Emerson	PERSON	's first novel , ''
Buell Hampton	PERSON	'' -LRB- Forbes -RRB- , errs chiefly in the attempt to put too much between the covers of a single book .

		The character from whom the story is named is a newspaper editor in
Kansas	LOCATION	, in a town that was the centre of a great cattle industry .

		The portrait is idealized greatly , but is vividly drawn and succeeds in doing a species of poetic justice to a much maligned class .

		A double love-story , international in one instance , runs through the argument ; there are many humorous inci - dents of Western life introduced , and the book is read - able though not well organized .

		Arkansas comes into the realm of fiction with ''
John Kenadie	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , -- the work of Mr.
Ripley D. Saunders	PERSON	.

		The sub-title calls it '' The Story of his Perplexing Inheritance , '' and the mystery which leads the hero -- a planter in a small way and a poet of no mean skill besides -- to alternately love and hate a fellow-townsman , is well contrived and handled .

		The story is one of rather unusual merit .

		A romance gleaned from the rugged life of
New England	LOCATION	fisherfolk is Mr.
Charles Clark Munn	PERSON	's '' Rock - haven '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In this case the hero is a young man sent to exploit a quarry in the interest of a firm of stock-jobbing rascals in
Boston	LOCATION	, and the hero - ine is a young girl from the island where the quarry i '' situated who has a wonderful natural gift of extract - ing moving music from her violin .

		In working out his story , the author makes an effective contrast of idyllic rusticity and the worst side of so-called respect - ability in cities .

		The book is well illustrated from drawings by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	.

		`` Miss Petticoats '' -LRB-
C. M. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written by ''
Dwight Tilton	PERSON	, '' an avowed nom de plume , and made beautiful by six colored drawings by Mr.
Charles H. Stephens	PERSON	.

		The scene of the earlier -- and better -- half of the book is laid in
New Bedford	LOCATION	, here called '' Old Chetford , '' and deals with the poor and proud daughter of a French nobleman vagrant in
America	LOCATION	long enough to marry an old sea captain 's one beloved child .

		The latter half of the book is melodramatic , redeemed only by a vivifying love .

		Born in
France	LOCATION	of an American father , an artist , and an Irish mother ; reared in a little country village in
England	LOCATION	, where her widowed mother sold ginger beer ; , and brought to the vicinity of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	by an aunt , the heroine of ''
Graystone	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- has a checq - uered career , ending in her becoming a trained nurse and waking up to find herself a millionaire .

		Two of her former townsmen in
England	LOCATION	come to
America	LOCATION	and are connected in their lives with hers , but she falls into the arms of an American of the best type at the end .

		This sounds a trifle heterogeneous , but the author , Mr.
William Jasper Nichols	PERSON	, has made a very good little story of it indeed , and deserves congratulation .

		Always exquisitely humorous ,
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Riggs	PERSON	-RRB- is at her best -- and briefest -- in '' The Diary of a Goose Girl '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a story of English rustic life from the point of view of an intelli - gent and gently critical American girl , who is seeking escape from a pursuing lover by immuring herself in a. small household where poultry of one sort and another is the chief interest .

		The story is told with reality enough to make it seem truly autobiographical , and is suitably illustrated with pen-drawings by Mr.
Claude A. Shepperson	PERSON	, admirably according with the insistent fun in the narrative .

		Two meritorious books from the pen of
Miss Eliza	LOCATION	- beth
Godfrey	PERSON	prepare the reader for a third good story in '' The Winding Road '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , and for a mingling of some musical element in the narrative .

		The hero here is a young Englishman of good family , but with a gipsy strain in his blood that keeps him wandering through the world with his faithful violin .

		A sudden attack of illness leads him to fall in love with the young woman who nurses him back to health , a dweller in a little cottage in a remote part of
England	LOCATION	.

		After some anguish of soul , the twain are duly married , and set off on their travels together .

		Miss
Godfrey	PERSON	is at her best in painting the scenes that follow , East and West appearing in the panorama of their wanderings ; and through it all appear the flutterings of the confirmed vagrant man to be free , and the struggle of the wife to find a home .

		The end is the inevitable one , and re - deemed from undue tragedy by a touch of mystery .

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 393 Granted a woman of extraordinary social accomplish - ments , left a widow with little money and six daugh - ters just arriving at nubile age , Mrs.
Lilias Campbell Davidson	PERSON	's '' The Confessions of a Match-Making Mother '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is at once whimsical and probable .

		It is purely a story of social politics , with the mother always a possibility as the heroine of a seventh slight romance .

		A round half-dozen of love stories in a single volume must satisfy the demands of the most exacting feminine reader .


South Africa	LOCATION	is the scene of '' The Story of Eden '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , and Miss
Dolf Wyllarde	PERSON	, the writer of the book , has been more than ordinarily happy in her title .

		For there is a serpent who leads away the heroine of her romance , and it differs from most books of the sort in enabling the girl to marry reasonably happily in spite of her early indiscretion .

		A careful and convinc - ing picture is drawn of a rather loose colonial society , with army officers to give it a character still more lax .

		The end comes with the sailing of the heroine and her husband for
England	LOCATION	while the war with the two re - publics is at its height , just as the villain of the plot is conveniently disposed of on the battlefield .

		Oriental sumptuousness and splendor of description mark Mr.
John W. Harding	PERSON	's biblical romance of war and politics under
King Hezekiah	ORGANIZATION	and the great Sennacherib .

		The prophet
Isaiah	PERSON	is one of the leading figures , and a singer called Naphtali the hero of a highly imaginative and effective bit of gorgeousness .

		< `` The Gate of the Kiss '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title , its ap - plication not becoming apparent until the crowning tragedy comes at the end of the book .

		The narrative is uniformly vivid and picturesque , and the story not improbable in spite of its distance in both time and place .

		Mr.
Harding	PERSON	shows signs of familiarity with the ' higher criticism , and has utilized side lights from recently discovered secular history to eke out the scrip - tural narrative .

		Rising from the humblest ranks in life and giving heavy hostage to fortune by a marriage most unprom - ising , the hero of ''
Enoch Strone	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- be - comes a politician and statesman in
England	LOCATION	, always retaining his sympathy for the class from which he sprung , and that without descending to demagogism .

		Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	writes the story with sym - pathies quite as broad and well directed as his hero 's , and is particularly fortunate in drawing the headstrong yet susceptible character of Mrs.
Strone	PERSON	.

		It is through much tribulation that the hero , mechanic , inventor , and politician of the best sort , comes into his own ; and the book is both long and readable .

		Mr.
Wallace Irwin	PERSON	, whose `` Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum '' have added not a little to the gaiety of at least one nation -LRB- the only one that could understand the language -RRB- , has produced , in '' The Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, Junior , '' an even more delectable invention .

		The younger Omar , it seems , found Naishapur an un - interesting place to live in after his father 's demise , and exiled himself to
Borneo	LOCATION	, where he cultivated the muse .

		The distinction between the two poets is summed up in the saying : '' Where the philosophy of the elder Omar was bacchanalian and epicurean , that of the son was tobacchanalian and eclectic . ''

		These quatrains must be read to be appreciated ; no extracts could illustrate ade - quately the quality of their delicious fooling .

		The book is published by
Messrs. Elder & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	.

		They have been served up at the breakfast - table with the

		Mr.
William S. Lord	PERSON	,
Evanston	LOCATION	, is responsible for the book - let in all save authorship .

		394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	,
Edwin Lawrence Godkin	PERSON	, who died in
England	LOCATION	on the twentieth of
May	DATE	, at the age of seventy , was an Irishman by birth , and the son of a distinguished Pro- testant clergyman .

		He was graduated from Queen 's College ,
Belfast	LOCATION	, when twenty years old , and entered upon the work of journalism .

		He represented the '' Daily News '' in
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	during the Crimean War , and at the close of that struggle came to this country , where he sent to his
London	LOCATION	journal a series of letters descriptive of a horseback journey through the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		He studied law in
New York	LOCATION	under
David Dudley Field	PERSON	, and was admitted to the bar in
1859	DATE	.

		During the next six years he prac - ticed both the legal and the journalistic professions , and then , in
1865	DATE	, established '' The Nation , '' of which be became the editor .

		He was now thoroughly identified with the country , and , as editor of '' The Nation '' until
1881	DATE	, and as joint editor of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' after the weekly had been merged in the daily , he remained for full thirty-five years the most brilliant and forceful figure in Amer - ican journalism .

		Harvard made him an
M. A.	ORGANIZATION	in
1871	DATE	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	made him a D. C. L. in
1897	DATE	.

		He was essentially a writer of leading articles throughout his editorial career , although he occasionally prepared more elaborate essays for the magazines .

		His books consist of a '' History of
Hungary	LOCATION	, '' a text book treat - ise on '' Government , '' and three volumes of collected essays and editorial articles .

		The journalist , like the actor , leaves no visible monument to attest his great - ness , and must be content with such fame as results from his being enshrined in the hearts of his followers .

		Of his following in this sort , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	had reason to be proud .

		His work appealed to the intellect and the conscience of his readers , and the higher political and ethical thought of a whole generation of Amer - icans was shaped by it more largely than by any other single influence .

		From the start , '' The Nation '' re - mained our most serious and dignified exponent of the ideas and principles that unite men of clear thought and lofty purpose in the fellowship of the intellectual republic .

		Educated readers all over the country looked to it for light and for guidance as one political prob - lem after another came up for solution ; they swore by '' The Nation '' as the champion of enlightenment against prejudice , of sincerity against hypocrisy , and of principle against partisanship .

		If they occasionally swore at it under their breath , it was an additional tribute to its fearlessness and its relentless fashion of dealing with every form of sham and selfishness .

		And it was to the master-mind of the editor that all these tributes were really paid , for there was never any doubt of the personal force that was exerted through the anonymous page .

		When Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	was honored by
the University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	a few years ago , some one suggested that bis influence upon political thought in
America	LOCATION	had been strikingly similar to the influence of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	upon English political thought , and the compliment seemed to us both happy and deserved .

		No words can express the gratitude felt by thousands of the younger men of to-day for the constant inspira - tion of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's leadership .

		The list of the good causes which he championed , and of the political con - troversies which invariably found him on the side of justice and sound scholarship , is too lengthy to be more than hinted at .

		He was a valiant fighter for the re - form of the civil service , for honest money and the sanctity of national obligations , and for the doctrine that a public office is a public trust .

		Undeterred by the temporary unpopularity of his attitude , he opposed the protective system as the incarnation of selfish and cor - rupt politics .

		He opposed the brutal methods of the reconstruction policy .

		He opposed the partisanship that seated
Hayes	PERSON	in the presidential chair and sought to bestow upon Blaine the highest honor in the gift of the Republic .

		He opposed the scandal of Hawaiian annexation , and praised the high-minded efforts of Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	to right that wrong .

		But when , a few years later , Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	made his one great official mis - take , and brought us to the verge of war with
England	LOCATION	upon a pretext that would have been ridiculous had it not been taken so seriously , he was as outspoken in condemnation as he had formerly been in praise .

		Fin - ally , and until the very end of his days , he protested with all the force of his immense moral indignation against the iniquity of our war with
Spain	LOCATION	, and the consequent iniquities of our broken pledge to
Cuba	LOCATION	, our insane war of Philippine conquest , and our practical repudiation of the political faith of the men who founded this nation .

		Sober opinion has already justi - fied him in most of these contentions , and will in time justify him in those that are still the subject of angry controversy .

		But his own voice will speak to us no more , and we know not from what other quarter we may hope to catch accents of such clear and ringing ethical quality .

		The spirit of compromise , of fatalism , of an easy-going acceptance of things as they are , in - fects our entire social organism , and we listen in vain for the trumpet-call of duty that shall arouse us from our national apathy in things spiritual .

Dudeney	PERSON	never writes without a purpose , and in this very original study of an unusual character her object is to disclose the principle of femininity as dominating even a strong , forceful , self-reliant woman ... ' Spindle and Plough ' is anything but commonplace , and is as strong a story as Mrs.

		The Yellow Fiend By Mrs.
Alexander	PERSON	The
Brooklyn Eagle	LOCATION	says : '' In ' The Yellow Fiend ' Mrs.
Alexander	PERSON	draws a vivid picture of an aged miser who labors under the delusion that a fiendish spirit , which can only be placated by the continued accumulation of the precious metal , dwells in gold .

		Detestable as the man 's character is the reader feels that he is deserving of pity , his sordid life having originated in his brooding over the death of a beautiful and idolized young wife who had fallen into a decline from want of the common necessaries of life .

		The main interest of the story centres in the miser 's granddaughter , who is unexpectedly left to his support by the death of her parents , and the story of her unhappiness , despair , and struggles to become an artist , in order to support herself , is sufficiently exciting to hold the interest to the end , which happily promises a fuller and happier life for the sorely tried heroine .

		BRIEFER MENTION 423 NOTES 424 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 424 THE CENTENNIAL HABIT .

		The practice of celebrating anniversaries , when they count up to some round number of years , is not exactly a modern one , but it has received such an impetus in our own time that we may fairly characterize it as a habit .

		Owing to the historical accident of our use of the Arabic system of numerals , the number one hundred , or some one of its multiples or factors , is the invariable basis of such cele - brations .

		Had the Babylonian reckoning by twelves instead of tens been adopted by our civilization , we should have had an entirely different set of numbers to work upon , but we should doubtless have singled out , just as we do now , the recurrent years of the completed cycle for special observance .

		Obviously noth - ing could be more artificial or conventional than this practice , which , to the logical mind , is matter for amusement ; but the habit of mental economy which leads us instinctively to attach a special significance to the round num - ber will always lead men to take special note of the tenth , or the fiftieth , or the one hundreth anniversary of the important event , and direct toward that event a degree of retrospective at - tention that nobody would think of giving it a year earlier or later .

		One can not help thinking , somehow , of the analogy offered by our mechanical religious ob - servance of the seventh day , by which so many people compound their real indifference to the whole subject of religion .

		In vain it is urged that if religion has any vital meaning at all , its influence ought to affect our lives on one day no less than another ; similarly , it is urged in vain that the memory of a great benefactor of mankind ought to remain with us as an abiding force all the time instead of appealing to us once in a hundred years or even once a year , that the fundamental principles of our national life ought to be the constant inspiration of our civic conduct , instead of being recalled , in a more or less perfunctory manner , when the full year has rolled round , or commemorated by some sort of a show when the full term of a hundred years is ended .

		Reason urges these considerations on us in vain ; and we shall no doubt continue , until the end of the chapter , in our easy-going ways , -- paying lip-service once a week or once a year to the religious faith which we profess , once a year or once a century to the memory of the great men , to the declara - tion of the principle or the foundation of the institution that exacts our homage .

		Leaving out of our discussion the more fre - quently recurring periods , let us think for a moment about decades and centuries and mil - lennial cycles .

		The fundamental reason why we exalt them into an illogical significance is doubtless found in our instinctive mental economy .

		Another reason is found in the taint of hypocrisy which is so apt to affect our attitude toward most serious subjects of contemplation that are not immediately related to our every-day tasks .

		Still another reason , and a most potent one , is the delight which the 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, average man takes in a show .

		We Americans , particularly , considering that we are a demo - cratic people by political profession , derive a most unholy satisfaction from every sort of pomp and ceremonial , and , while repudiating the ideas upon which such old-world inventions rest , do our best to rival the ostentations of '' effete monarchies . ''

		Sponsors as we are of a new social order nationally consecrated by great deeds and devotions , we copy as far as we may the pageantry of the old order , and look with envying regret upon those European possibili - ties which are American impossibilities .

		To those whose eyes are chiefly for the spectacular , an American centennial naust be a poor thing in comparison , let us say , with a Hungarian millennial ; what compensation we have for the picturesque elements denied us may be satisfy - ing to the intellect , but they leave the aesthetic sense a little starved .

		We are not saying all this by way of blame for an assumed manifestation of national folly ; the craving for show and color and imposing ceremonial is a thing too essentially inherent in human nature to be thus stigmatized .

		To the historical sense no less than to the sense for the picturesque do these things have gen - uine value , and we are quite worthily occupied as a people when we bend our best energies to such an impressive commemoration as that of the first centennial of the nation 's birth , or the fourth centennial of the discovery of the new world .

		But it is nevertheless possible that the thing may be overdone .

		When we think of the long succession of centennials since
1776	DATE	, it seems as though some of them might have been spared .

		It was only
last year	DATE	that we were celebrating the installation of
John Marshall	PERSON	; and next year , or the year after , we shall be celebrating the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	.

		It some - times seems that anything will serve as a pre - text for a centennial celebration .

		The age of the multi-centennials is now upon us .

		Yale had a bicentennial a few months ago , and a decade ago the whole country had a quadricentennial .

		The first of what will doubtless be a long series of tricentennials was celebrated the other day at
Cuttyhunk	LOCATION	, in memory of
Bartholomew Gos	ORGANIZATION	- nold 's short-lived colony ,
Jamestown	LOCATION	is sure to < ; ome in course of time , and
Plymouth	LOCATION	and Sa - lem , and the whole series of colonial beginnings .

		Possibly after a while we shall become weary of recalling our national history in this spas - modic way , and hit upon some more rational plan of keeping the past alive in our memory .

		Among the most acceptable centennials of recent years have been those planned in cele - bration of the founding of our older colleges .

		Harvard attained to the dignity of a quarter - millennial as long ago as
1886	DATE	;
Yale	ORGANIZATION	had its bicentennial only last year ;
Princeton	LOCATION	had its sesquicentennial half a dozen years ago .

		We read the other day that some small college or other , nearing its seventy-fifth birthday , was preparing to celebrate a semi-sesquicentennial .

		This opens a rather appalling vista of frac - tional cycles and the possibilities associated with them .

		And our own
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago last year , youthful through no fault of its own , set anew fashion in anniversaries by cele - brating its first decennial with as much display as would have been suited to an institution many times as aged .

		Ten years should certainly be the limit , and a halt should sternly be called at this point ; otherwise the next new educational foundation to be established may be so eager to have its own praises sung that it will seek to com - memorate the completion of its first lustrum .

		The literary centennial is usually a simple and dignified performance , against which little may be urged beyond what has already been said of all periodical celebrations .

		Some years ago , we noted the fact that exactly two thou - sand years had elapsed since the birth of
Cicero	LOCATION	, and suggested as a novelty in celebrations a bimillennial demonstration on the part of clas - sical scholars .

		Among the longer terms cele - brated in our own time there will be recalled the millennial of
Alfred	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	, the sixth centennial of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in
1865	DATE	, the fourth of Michelangelo in
1874	DATE	, the third of Shake - speare in
1864	DATE	, and the Goethe sesquicenten - nial in

		The simple literary centennial is being celebrated somewhere and by some - body almost every year .

		It is usually char - acterized by an uncritical laudation of its subject in both speech and print , and , unlike the cere - mony of canonization , it does not willingly give a respectful hearing to the devil 's advocate .

		In the judgment of those who plan the cele - bration , the subject is already canonized , and there is nothing more to say .

		The true spirit of literary appreciation is not , after all , to be found in demonstrations of any sort .

		These are nearly always suggestive of the Pharisee who says his prayers openly to gain a reputation for piety .

		The real lover of literature will , rather than indulge in any outward manifestation of his affection , follow the example of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and offer up unuttered and heartfelt words of grace when - ever he takes up his
Milton	PERSON	or his Spenser for an hour of spiritual recreation .

		The Chateaubriand Memoirs .

		* '' If I were still the owner of these Memoirs , I would either keep them in manuscript or delay their appearance for fifty years . ''

		So , just before his death , wrote the
Viscount Cha	PERSON	- teaubriand of the Memoires d' Outre-tombe .

		With their completion , he had tried to '' cheat the tedium of those last forlorn hours which we neither desire , nor know how to employ . ''

		Before the end came he found himself under the painful necessity of selling the Memoirs , and they were published immediately after his death .

		Now , after a delay a little longer than that wished for by the author , there is appear - ing an English edition of these justly famous reminiscences .

		The translator is
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	, whose uncompromisingly foreign name is no index of his ability to mas - ter the English idiom .

		Four volumes , carrying the
Viscount	PERSON	's life down to the year
1829	DATE	, have already appeared , and the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	promise the remaining two within the year .

		In his own day , Chateaubriand was rated unreservedly as the foremost man of letters in
France	LOCATION	, if not in all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Today his remi - niscences , in
America	LOCATION	at least , must win atten - tion largely on their own merit , -- rather as the stirring life-story of a great Frenchman than as the personal revelation of the author of ''
Atala	PERSON	'' and ''
Rene	PERSON	, '' or '' The Genius of Christianity . ''

		Few men , surely , have more material at hand out of which to construct an autobiogra - phy .

		A dreamy , vagabond childhood spent in
Brittany	LOCATION	; a restless youth dedicated to the church but finally devoted to the army ; a pre - sentation at
Versailles	LOCATION	, arranged to satisfy a brother 's ambition ; a taste of garrison life , and another , very unwelcome to the shy young sol - dier , of Parisian society ; finally a quixotic journey to the
United States	LOCATION	in search of the
Northwest Passage	ORGANIZATION	, -- and at twenty-four , when the
Chevalier de Chateaubriand	ORGANIZATION	came back to
France	LOCATION	to fight for his king against his father - land , he was already a man of the world .

		himself lived to win the gratitude of
Napoleon	PERSON	and to watch the fall of '' the Man of the
Time	ORGANIZATION	, '' to witness the restoration of the legiti - mate royal line , and to occupy positions of honor and trust under the new government .

		At the close of the fourth volume we leave him at the summit of his fame , as French Ambas - sador to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		So much for the political side of his career .

		In its intervals of exile or disgrace he became a renowned traveller ; under stress of poverty he made his literary reputation .

		In one capa - city or another he came to know , casually at least , all the greatest men of his time in both continents .

		Naturally in many chapters of his Memoirs he is less the central figure than the observer , the critic , or the raconteur .

		Yet in spite of the objectivity inseparable from the story of so eventful a life , the Me - moirs are deeply subjective ; to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	mind certainly , even obtrusively and baldly egotistical . ''

		It was fated that I should be plagued by princes . ''

		Like '' the man of destiny '' whom he served , Chateaubriand be - lieves himself born for great things , and insists upon his readers ' appreciation and reverence .

		And yet in the next breath he lets fall a de - preciatory sentence like this : '' Good for everything where others , good for noth - ing where I myself am concerned : there you have me . ''

		Does destiny , then , overcome temperament ?

		With similar inconsistency he breaks into a stirring narrative with a plaintive comment on the vanity of the things of this world : `` While bidding farewell to the woods of Aulney , I shall recall the farewell which long ago I bade to the woods of Combourg ; my days are all farewells . ''

		Again , with melancholy languor , he says of himself : '' It is easy to possess resignation , patience , a general obligingness , equanimity of temper , when one interests himself in nothing , when one is wearied by everything , when one replies to good and bad fortune alike with a desperate and despairing `` What does it matter ? ' ''

		This Byronic boredom is no longer in the fashion ; combined with the strange turns of fortune which the Viscount experienced , it imparts to the Memoirs a tinsel , theatrical air of romantic melancholy , curiously out of date since
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Yet , for all his hlase affectation , the Vis - count has many admirable qualities .

		He is fearless in times of great danger , honest when honesty was clearly impolitic , true to his legiti - mate principles no matter what they cost him , an avowed advocate of Christianity in a nation 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, of atheists .

		He is forever lamenting that he was born too late , but his world-weariness does not tempt him into idle acquiescence in the new order of things .

		The style of the Memoirs is as varied as the matter that composes them .

		A perfect mirror of the man who wrote it , it is an odd mixture of garrulity , affectation , pomposity , brilliancy , and delicate charm .

		Occasionally he becomes tersely epigrammatic , -- as when , apropos of his neglecting to visit Luther 's tomb at
Witten	PERSON	- berg , he thus expresses the full measure of his conservatism : '' Protestantism in religion is only an illogical heresy , in politics only an abortive revolution . ''

		More often he indulges in picturesque de - scription .

		The full force of the romantic man - ner comes out in a paragraph like this upon Mirabeau : `` ' Mirabeau 's ugliness , laid on over the substratum of beauty special to his race , produced a sort of powerful figure from the Last Judgment of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	... The scars dug into the orator 's face by the small - pox had rather the semblance of gaps left by the fire .

		Nature seems to have moulded his head for Empire or the gallows , and to have hewn his arms to clasp a nation or carry off a woman .

		When he shook his mane as he looked at the mob , he stopped it ; when he raised his paw and showed his claws , the plebs ran furiously .

		I have seen him in the tribune , amid the awful disorder of a sitting , sombre , ugly , and motion - less ; he reminded one of
Milton	LOCATION	's Chaos , shapeless and impassive in the centre of his own confusion . ''

		His delicacy of touch is most evident in the descriptions of nature , -- of
Brittany	PERSON	as he knew it in his childhood , or the primeval forests of the new world ; or again in picturing the creatures of his imagination , particularly that sylph of his boyish dreams , a woman built up '' out of all the women whom I had ever seen , '' with an admiiture of the graces of the heathen goddesses , and even a hint of the Vir - gin herself .

		On the whole , it is the first volume , which deals with Chateaubriand 's youth , that has most life and atmosphere .

		It is the idyl , the pastoral , to which his style is best suited .

		The complex narrative of the later years would often be more interesting if the stage were smaller .

		Too many of the personages written of have to be rescued from oblivion by the foot-notes , and are not really resuscitated .

		The polemical portions of the book , too , pre - senting documentary evidence in vindication of the author or his friends , possess little of the human interest which is the vital principle of biography .

		But if this treasure-trove is unwieldy , De
Mattos	PERSON	' friend was right in call - ing it also monumental .

		That is why the translator has wished to present it to us in English for the first time in its impressive en - tirety .

		He has done his part as annotator and translator exceedingly well .

		The publishers have brought the work out in handsome vol - umes , abundantly illustrated with views of Chateaubriand 's homes , and portraits of his contemporaries , many of them reproduced in photogravure .

		So at last there is no reason why this man , so conspicuous both in the lit - erature and history of his time , may not be - come pleasantly familiar to a large circle of English readers , through what many critics consider his most important work -- his story of himself .

		The Beginnings op the
Great West	LOCATION	.

		* We may distinguish two principal '' Wests '' in American history .

		The old or middle West extended from the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	mountains to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	river .

		Its settlement began during the Revolution , and it was fairly filled with population and its political organization was completed by the middle of the nineteenth cen - tury .

		The tier of States lying along the west bank of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and extending from
Louisiana	LOCATION	to
Minnesota	LOCATION	, became historically , as it was geographically , a part of the old West .

		The region beyond and between them and the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	constituted the new , the far , or the great West .

		Its settlement was a long time delayed .

		At first the land was not needed , and , more than that , was not thought worth having .

		Later , a barrier of Indian reserva - tions checked emigration , and the slavery con - troversy blocked organization .

		The occupation of this region began suddenly , in
the fourth decade of the century	DATE	, with the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	, the emigration to
Oregon	LOCATION	, and the rush to
California	LOCATION	for gold .

		The greater interest attaching to these events has obscured the earlier period , and its history is almost a blank .

		Captain
H. M. Chittenden	PERSON	has recently entered this neglected field , in his '' American Fur Trade of the Far West , '' and around the history of the fur trade has grouped almost the whole history of the period .

		He has found that the period is not only interest - ing , but that it exerted a direct and important influence upon the course of later events , serving * The American Fuk Trade of the Far West .

		THE DIAL 413 as a sort of preparatory or '' middle-age '' stage in the development of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Specifically , his work covers the period between the return of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, in
1806	DATE	, and the year
1843	DATE	.

		The latter year is in many ways a turning-point in Western history .

		Fremont 's exploring expeditions had recently begun , the
Santa	LOCATION	Fe trade was finally closed , and the first considerable emigration to
Oregon	LOCATION	took place .

		Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	divides his work into five parts .

		Part I. treats of the characteristic features of the fur trade as carried on during the period under review , the kind of furs sought , and the methods of trapping and tra - ding .

		The business is peculiar in many re - spects , and an understanding of its peculiarities is essential to an understanding of its history .

		Part II .

		presents the history of the organization and operations of the various fur companies .

		This part comprises the bulk of the work , and contains the principal results of the author 's researches .

		Supplementary to the history of the fur trade , an account is given of the over - land trade with
Santa Fe	ORGANIZATION	, from its inception in
1822	DATE	until its close in
1843	DATE	.

		The route of both the
Oregon	LOCATION	and
Santa	LOCATION	Fe trails is care - fully described .

		Part III .

		gives an account of contemporary events , not forming a part of the fur trade , but more or less directly affecting it , -- such as the War of
1812	DATE	, Long 's ex - ploring expeditions ,
Leavenworth	LOCATION	's campaign against the Aricaras ,
Atkinson	PERSON	's treaty-making tour , and the small-pox scourge among the Indians in
1837	DATE	.

		Part IV .

		is an anecdotal account of the more notable incidents and characters connected with the fur trade , stories of Indian fights , hairbreadth escapes , and fron - tier desperadoes .

		Part V. gives a description of the mountains , rivers , flora , fauna , and native tribes of the West , in their relation to the fur trade .

		An appendix reproducing some original documents , and a valuable map indi - cating routes of travel and the location of trading-posts , complete the work .

		Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	's insight into historical relations is clear .

		He brings out the impor - tance of the exclusion of
France	LOCATION	from the American continent by the French and Indian war , an event often obscured by the stress we are accustomed to lay upon the Revolution .

		His identification of each of the successive ter - ritorial acquisitions composing the Far West with marked geographical features is worth emphasizing .

		Upper
Louisiana	LOCATION	comprised the watershed of the
Missouri	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	the valley of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and the Mexican cession lay chiefly within the drainage basin of the Colo - rado ; so that each territorial addition consisted of a distinct geographical unity .

		On its biblio - graphical side .

		Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	's work is unsatisfactory .

		The bulk of his material is drawn from rare files of early
Missouri	LOCATION	news - papers , and from the manuscript records of the fur companies ; but his references to sources are so indefinite that one can scarcely test the accuracy of his work without undertaking it anew .

		A careful bibliography of printed books , a description of the manuscript material , and more specific reference to the authorities for particular statements , would have been a de - cided advantage .

		Upon one subject of some general interest ,
Captain Chittenden	ORGANIZATION	is in error .

		He concludes that the so-called '' flathead deputation , '' out of which the Methodist and
American Board	ORGANIZATION	missions in
Oregon	LOCATION	grew , visited
St. Louis	LOCATION	in the
autumn of 1832	DATE	.

		Major
Edmond Mallet	PERSON	has proved , from the correspondence of Bishop Rosati printed in the '' Annals for the
Propa	PERSON	- gation of the Faith , '' and from the registry of sepultures kept in the
Catholic Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	at
St. Louis	LOCATION	, that the visit of the deputation took place in the
autumn of 1831	DATE	.

		The missionary account of this visit was derived from a letter written by a Wyandot chief named
William Walker	PERSON	to
G. P. Disoway	PERSON	, which was originally printed in the '' Christian Advocate '' in
1833	DATE	, and which Captain
Chittenden	PERSON	reprints in an appendix .

		In transmitting the letter to the '' Christian Advocate , '' Mr.
Disoway	PERSON	assumed , and it has since been taken for granted , that
Walker	ORGANIZATION	's trip was made in
1832	DATE	; but
Walker	PERSON	's letter does not say so , and the records of the
St. Louis Indian Agency	ORGANIZATION	, now in the library of the
Kansas State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, show that it was made the year before .


November 22 , 1831	DATE	, the
Iowa	LOCATION	Sub-Agent reported to General
Clark	PERSON	the visit of '' Mr.
Walter	PERSON	and party , '' either the agent or the copyist changing Walker to
Walter	PERSON	; and General
Clark	PERSON	, in writing the Indian Department
December 28 , 1831	DATE	, referred to '' the Wyandot Indians and their leaders , who lately explored the Country above . ''

		In his report to
General Cass	ORGANIZATION	, dated
November 20 , 1831	DATE	, General
Clark	PERSON	doubtless referred to the '' flathead delegation '' in saying that Indians `` from west of the Rocky moun - tains are visiting me . ''

		The point is chiefly interesting as showing the careless and uncrit - ical way in which missionary history has been made up .

		The importance of the fur trade is to be 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, measured by the activity of the traders rather than by their number .

		The average number of traders is estimated as about five hundred ; yet this small number almost covered the entire West with their forts and trading-posts .

		Cap - tain
Chittenden	PERSON	has located and traced the origin of as many as one hundred and forty of these posts .

		The greatest service that the traders rendered was that of exploring the en - tire region and pointing out the most practic - able routes of travel in its later settlement .

		Exploration was of course incidental with them , as with the early American colonists ; but an increase of geographical knowledge nevertheless resulted .

		The overland
Astoria	LOCATION	expeditions very nearly opened the whole of the
Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
California	LOCATION	expeditions of
J. S. Smith	PERSON	added so much geographical information , that
Gallatin	LOCATION	was able to construct a fairly accurate map of the entire West , -- = - a map which Bonneville appropriated and in some respects improved .

		In fact , as Captain Chit - tenden points out , the fur traders were the true '' pathfinders '' of the West , and anticipated all the important geographical discoveries that are usually attributed to the official explorers of later date .

		Politically , the traders rendered important service .

		At the North they held the British in check until the time was ripe for settlement .

		At the South they not only opened the way for military occupation , but , by uniting New Mex - ican interests with our own , rendered that oc - cupation the more acceptable .

		The settlement of the West was largely a question of trans - portation , and this question was worked out gradually by the experiments of the traders .

		The earliest trade followed the
Missouri	LOCATION	river , and was carried on with keelboats until steam - boats took their place in
1832	DATE	.

		The overland trade began with pack-horses .

		Wagons were introduced on the
Santa Fe Trail	ORGANIZATION	in
1822	DATE	, and on the
Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	in
1830	DATE	.

		Bonneville took the first wagons through the
South Pass	LOCATION	to
Green	ORGANIZATION	river in
1832	DATE	, and the
Oregon	LOCATION	emigra - tion closed the period of experiment by taking them through to the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	river in
1843	DATE	.

		Thus , from every point of view , the life of the hunter , the trapper , and the trader constituted a preparatory stage in the history of the
West	LOCATION	, which paved the way for its later settlement and growth .

		In looking back upon the history of the fur trade , it is easy to see that the
United States	LOCATION	ought either to have carried on the trade through its own agencies , or to have granted it , under strict control , to a monopoly like the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its earlier stages , the Indian trade was regulated through gov - ernment factories ; but the system was never extended to any extent beyond the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and was abolished in
1822	DATE	.

		Private competi - tion debauched the natives with liquor , incited tribal wars , and gave the Indian a poor opinion of the character of the white man .

		But it was an era of faith in the efficiency of free com - petition as a regulator of business , and of belief that monopoly in any form was a violation of private right .

		It was not understood that competition often reduces business to the level of the lowest competitor , and that monopoly in many cases is the best form of regulation .

		The statesmen of the time acted , in their regulation of the fur trade , upon universally accepted theory .

		The story of the Indian is a painful one , but the outcome could not in any event have been greatly altered , p jj ^ Hodder .

		Records of ak Amiable `` Weakness .

		* The enthusiasm of the typical collector , whether of faded tapestries , of postage stamps , or of bugs and beetles , excites a smile , half of amusement , half of envy , from one who has never felt himself carried away by the cacoethes coUigendi , the rage to possess an unrivalled assortment of something , no matter how intrin - sically worthless and uninteresting .

		One of the present writer 's schoolmates , by no means a wooden-headed lad , was given to collecting bits of wood , no two of a kind ; and these lig - neous fragments he would exhibit with infinite complacency .

		What the collector collects mat - ters not , if only the collecting mania be upon him .

		But when the madness takes the form ex - emplified by Mr.
Joline	PERSON	's diverting collection of autographia , amusement gives place to grati - tude .

		His book is an onniium - gatherum of many sorts of good things , and bears ample testimony to a long experience in intelligent collecting of interesting memorials of interest - ing people .

		The autograph collector , in Mr.
Joline	PERSON	's sense of the term , is not a collector of signatures , not an autograph-album fiend , but a person who appreciates the value of letters and other signed documents from the hands of the good and great , and who is given to pre - * Meditations of an Autograph Collector .

		THE DIAL , 415 serving such memorials .

		The self-respecting collector is not obtrusive ; he never writes a beg - ging letter to a stranger , but gathers his ma - terial from friends and acquaintances , and from reputable traders in such wares .

		The dangers of imposture are ever to be guarded against .

		Clever forgeries abound .

		Copies also that are made in all innocence occasionally find their way into the market as originals .

		Photographic reproductions , too , may deceive the inexpe - rienced , but never the expert .

		Most annoying of all , a letter signed ''
Thomas Jones	PERSON	'' may not be his , but from another man of the same name .

		Our author justly deplores the increas - ing vogue of the stenographer and the type - writer .

		The one lingering trace of individuality in a present-day letter is too often limited to the signature , and even this may be only the impression of a rubber stamp .

		Truly the out - look is depressing .

		The '' meditations '' are delightfully miscel - laneous in character and haphazard in arrange - ment , chopped into chapters of convenient length .

		The author pleads , in humorous apol - ogy for his lack of method , that '' these desul - tory jottings , with all their sins and imperfec - tions , are only the staggerings of the mind of an ancient collector , the maunderings of an obsolete person . ''

		Being a book-lover as well as an autograph collector , he has harvested much that is of literary interest , including au - thors ' manuscripts and rare first editions with authors ' signatures .

		Dramatic , political , and historical characters are also well represented .

		Revolutionary generals cut a considerable figure in the book , with their quaintly spelled letters ; and even the Signers -- the despair of all collectors , so far as a complete collection of the famous fifty-six is concerned -- make a re - spectable showing .

		The written-to-order letter is seldom of great interest , but here is one of
Stevenson	PERSON	's that does not lack character : ''
Vailima	LOCATION	,
Upolu	LOCATION	,
Samoa	LOCATION	. ''

		You have sent me a slip to write on : you have sent me an addressed envelope : you have sent it to me stamped : many have done as much before .

		You have spelled my name right , and some have done that .

		In one point you stand alone : you have sent me the stamps for my post-office , not the stamps for yours .

		What is asked with so much consideration , I take a pleasure to grant .

		Here , since you value it and have been at the pains to earn it by such unusual attention -- here is the signature of ``
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	. ''

		For the one civil autograph collector ,
Charles	PERSON	R -- . ''

		There is a tone of weary condescension about this , and one resents the writer 's imputation of incivility against all previous applicants for his valued signature .

		Surely there must have been many among his admirers who , unable though they were to procure Samoan postage stamps , yet failed not to proffer their requests in re - spectful terms .

		Contrast now another great man 's response to a like petition : ``
R. Shelton Mackenzie	PERSON	, -- Below is my autograph for your good lady as you request . ''

		Yours truly , ''
A. Lincoln	PERSON	. ''

		As an instance of the mock-modest auto - graph-to-order , take the following .

		Its absurd self-abasement is laughable .

		`` Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	presents his compliments to Miss C -- , but would rather not make her collection and himself ridiculous by sending it the autograph of an insignificant person . ''

		How crushing to Miss C -- , to be called it !

		For we hold , with Mr.
Joline	PERSON	, that one does not send one 's autograph to a collection , but to the collector .

		Finally , as an example of grace - ful compliance with a request that must always be more or less of an annoyance , nothing could be better than this from Colonel Higginson : '' I have your note .

		If , as somebody says , applica - tions for autographs are ' a shadow cast by success , ' I suppose one can no more object to them than one can quarrel with his shadow . ''

		Beside autographs , the book deals with many remotely related matters , mostly literary or historical .

		Judgments are delivered in the slap-dash manner of an after-dinner chat , and so are not to be taken too seriously .

		Here is an opinion on English reviewers that is not without basis : '' There does not appear to be any adequate reason why English reviewers should be as hard and severe as they almost invariably are .

		Their style bears to true criticism about the same relation which the conduct of the savage who knocks down the object of his affec - tions and drags her to his home bears to the conven - tional courtship of civilization ... Any writer is en - titled to a fair , generous , and liberal treatment .

		It is a small and petty mind which will use the power of an anonymous reviewer to denounce and ridicule his subject . ''

		Our author seems not to be heartily enam - oured of his English cousins .

		Because Mr.
Serjeant Robinson	PERSON	, in his `` Reminiscences of the Bench and Bar , '' finds fault with
Judah P. Benjamin	PERSON	's American twang , Mr.
Joline	PERSON	retorts that
Benjamin	PERSON	's tone '' was absolutely twang - less , and it was , as compared with the hollow , rough , and coarse bow-wow of the Englishman , like the song of the nightingale beside the caw of the crow . ''

		The American twang , however , is not a figment of the British fancy -- to our sorrow be it said , -- and the first step toward amendment is honest confession .

		The utter - 416 THE DIAL -LSB-

		By a curious fatality , we censure the very errors we ourselves are most prone to commit -- a reflection that gives the professional critic pause .

		After deploring Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's per - petuation of the scandal concerning
Byron	PERSON	's unhappy domestic relations , the Autograph Collector , only two pages further on , refers to
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife as living together in `` ferocious gloom . ''

		`` Their feuds and quar - rels , '' he adds , '' were bitter and continuous . ''

		Again , he lays it down as a truth that quota - tions are more than likely to he incorrect ; and on a later page he furnishes an involuntary proof of his thesis by misquoting the opening lines of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Brahma . ''

		He takes pains , on page 132 , to correct a slight mis - statement on page 19 , adding , `` after all , my mistake is not of much importance , except to me , for I always feel sure that I never make a blunder -- until I am caught at it . ''

		Com - mending this love of accuracy for its own sake , may we correct another slight error of his ?

		The Principles of Western Civilization .

		* It must be confessed that Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	's latest book , '' Principles of Western Civilization , '' is rather a disappointing piece of social philoso - phy .

		The same faults , and , strange to say , the same merits which characterized his '' Social Evolution '' are evident also in his '' Western Civilization . ''

		In each book the first chapter is singularly stimulating and concise in thought , as it sketches the achievements of our present time and asks what is in store for us in the fu - ture .

		One naturally expects an equally direct and clearly formulated answer , or at least an acute and pointed investigation into the ele - ments which might tend toward some satisfac - tory solution .

		But the author disdains such * Principles of Western Civilization .

		business-like methods .

		The thread of discus - sion , at first so firmly grasped , in the very next chapter drops as from weary hands , and there ensues a desultory , rambling inquiry into the innumerable factors that have made up the present stage of our civilization .

		This inquiry consists largely of reiteration of set phrases , and of what some one has said concerning so - cial and economic problems twenty years ago .

		We have never read an author who so con - sistently argued backward to a point lying leagues and leagues away from the original basis of the argument , and who so unremit - tingly forced his reader to review old issues only too familiar or possibly even discarded .

		But one has perhaps no right to quarrel with an author about his methods , if he only comes to a definite conclusion in the end .

		Here too , however , our author is singularly unsatisfying ; he says a great deal about the present and the past , but systematically relin - quishes any but the vaguest and most general conclusions about the future .

		Yet Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	distinctly claims originality for his book , and the glory of a discovery quite as important for future social philosophy as
Darwin	PERSON	's '' natural selection '' or the '' survival of the fittest . ''

		He begins by pointing out , what we are sorry to say everybody has long been aware of , that our present period is a period of self-seeking as the generally accepted moral code .

		This code is based upon the liberal doctrines of the eighteenth century , the accentuated individ - ualism of the French Revolution , and the social-democratic ideal of equal enjoyment for all , counteracted by the new Herrenmoral of the age now beginning .

		Centuries of develop - ment have worked toward this end ; and since this condition sees its ideal in the satisfac - tion of the individual , Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	calls it the '' ascendancy of the present . ''

		Yet , basing his argument upon his study of
Darwin	PERSON	and
Weissmann	PERSON	, he maintains that nature is not satisfied with the present , that in fact the present is what nature is least concerned with ; it is for the future , for the generations to come , that the individual is sacrificed .

		Thus there is some method in the apparent madness of waste and destruction ; and for this future , natural selection in the present is the necessary prerequisite .

		`` Projected efficiency '' is what he calls this systematic preparation , genera - tions ahead , for some prospective issue .

		This is all very well , but it hardly justifies the author in looking upon so slender a revela - tion as an important discovery , since it is

		THE DIAL 417 almost as commonplace and matter-of-fact an observation as an evolutionist can make .

		People who have not the thinking habit may consider '' projected efficiency '' a very great addition to the terms which science has created as expressions of order and plan in the uni - verse .

		But whatever may be said about the term , the idea that the present lives for the future has been in men 's minds from the be - ginning , and consciously recognised as para - mount in all creation . ''

		Go to the ant and be wise , '' -- what does the ant do but build and burrow and slave for its progeny ?

		And the humblest as well as the proudest of mortals , does he not do likewise ?

		Yet to the proving of this somewhat trite proposition Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	devotes several chapters .

		His answer to the question .

		What kind of efficiency will prevail in the future ?

		is but little more satisfactory .

		In the twentieth cen - tury he sees , as the future prevailing type , the type organized towards '' military efficiency '' ; that is , let us say , the type having the most de - structive firearms and the most efficient explo - sives , -- presumably those that discharge their deadly weapons by pressing the electric button !

		It seems as if , after a repetition of types of the destructive kind from the .

		very beginning of things , we might expect in the present indus - trial era at least some slight variation .

		If Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	had pointed out as the surviving type the one which could most advantageously close a bargain , we should have been able to point to this as something new if not more attractive ; or if he had said that the survivor was to be the one who could subsist the longest on the least , we should have seen the logical conclusion in the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest .

		Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	appears to use historical incidents to fit his purpose just as freely as Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	whom he censures , and he is far less explicit and direct in his explanation of them .

		For example , when Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	has pointed to the circumstance that life is sacred in the modern state as it never was in the ancient , he pro- ceeds to explain this by the assumption that * ' in the last resort , the life of the individual is related to ends and principles which entirely transcend the objects for which the political organization around us itself exists . ''

		The plainer explanation would be that the under - standing of the ends and principles which trans - cend the objects referred to is due to religious belief in a future existence , which in the first place awakens responsibility .

		But such plain statements are not Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	's strong point ; he likes circumventions .

		Sweeping assertions and generalities are , as of old , the besetting sin of the evolutionists who attain to philosophical breadth of view .

		Incidentally there are many interesting remarks made in the book .

		Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	is at his best in his parentheses ; but the really decisive statements and arguments are lost in the general melee of explanations , re - iterations , and references to something else , which make the reader impatient for a bit of plain reasoning .

		We hope some day to see an abridged edition of Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	's works , in which some of the evils of style and method here complained of shall have been eliminated .

Ellen Terry	PERSON	and her Sisters .

		*
Two years ago this month	DATE	we had occasion to review in these columns an authentic life of '' The Kendals , '' by Mr.
T. Edgar Pemberton	PERSON	.

		To those interested in the history of the con - temporary stage the volume proved particularly welcome .

		The author has now given us a com - panion volume entitled ''
Ellen Terry	PERSON	and her Sisters , '' in which a number of biographical de - tails not hitherto obtainable have been grouped together with considerable skill , making a story which reads easily and consecutively .

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	has for many years been termed by some the greatest living Shakespearian actress .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's timely memoir re - veals to us much of her inner life , and traces her outward history ; shows us the influences under which she grew up and developed , -- the traits of her character ^ early and strongly manifested , -- and follows her theatrical career from her maiden effort at the age of six years , through its successive stages down to the hey - day of a most eventful life .

		It was while Mr. and Mrs.
Ben Terry	PERSON	were fulfilling an engagement at
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	that their daughter
Ellen Terry	PERSON	was born .

		This was on
February 27 , 1848	DATE	, and a little feud has taken place among the people of that interesting '' City of Three Tall Spires '' as to the precise house in which the important event took place .

		The child made her earliest -LRB- though childish -RRB- successes with
Charles Kean	PERSON	in a famous series of Shakespearian revivals .

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	has said : '' It must be remembered that my sister aud I had the advantage of exceedingly clever and conscientious •

		My father was a charming elocutionist , and my mother read Shakspeare beauti - fully , and then both were very fond of us and saw our faults with eyes of love , though they were unsparing in their corrections .

		And , indeed , they had need of all their patience , for , for my own part , I know I was a most troublesome , wayward pupil . ''

		It has always been conceded that the stock company is the practical school of dramatic art .

		It was in the
Bristol	LOCATION	Stock Company that Miss
Terry	PERSON	received her early training , -- and '' the firing of the clay brought out the colors of the porcelain , and the colors lasted . ''

		It was merely a West of
England	LOCATION	stock company , but it could boast of such a constellation of names as
Madge Robertson	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.

George Melville	PERSON	,
Arthur Stirling	PERSON	,
W. H. Vernon	PERSON	,
Arthur Wood	PERSON	, and
Charles Coghlan	PERSON	.

		In 1867
Ellen Terry	PERSON	became the wife of Mr.
Charles Wardell	PERSON	-- known to playgoers as
Charles Kelly	PERSON	, the name he adopted when , retiring from his position as an officer in a first-class cavalry regiment , he followed his in - clinations and took to the stage .

		She then retired from public life for seven years , re - turning in
1874	DATE	and acting continually up to the present day .

		It was while appearing with
John Hare	PERSON	in '' Olivia '' -- the stage version of
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	's immortal story , `` The Vicar of Wakefield '' -- that
Henry Irving	PERSON	invited her to be his helpmate in his management of the Lyceum Theater .

		As Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	says , it is not surprising that she should say , after that memorable engagement : '' I seem to have made J ; he acquaintance and to know quite intimately some noble people -- Hamlet and
Ophelia	LOCATION	,
Portia	LOCATION	,
Benedict	PERSON	and
Beatrice	PERSON	,
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	,
Viola	PERSON	, the Macbeths .

		All this makes me rejoice and wonder how it is that I 'm not a superior person !

		I have dwelt with such very good company .

		It has been all sunshine , with a wee cloud here and there to give zest to life ; and my lines have been laid in pleas - ant places . ''

		Her cause was won ; all
England	LOCATION	had learned that a star of the first magnitude had risen to the zenith of the dramatic heavens .

		Of late years the work of
Ellen Terry	PERSON	has become as familiar to the American public as to the English .

		The annual engagements of Henry
Irving	PERSON	and his co-star have been num - bered among the triumphs of each theatrical season .

		As Volumnia in '' Coriolanus , ''
Cla	ORGANIZATION	- rice de Malucon in ♦ '
Robespierre	LOCATION	, '' and Queen Guinevere in
Comyns Carr	PERSON	's drama of ''
King Arthur	PERSON	, '' her recent triumphs have been com - plete .

		In personating a character she identifies herself so entirely with her part that her face seems to flush or pale with the varying excite - ment of her character .

		Whatever the senti - ment or situation of the moment , everything that goes to make up the ensemble of the actress moves and speaks in unison ; so that , whether portraying the complex emotions of life , or the convergent subsidence of death , she is , in look , voice , and attitude , the living , vibrant , imper - sonation of her theme .

		It has been pointed out that the artistic tem - perament must be more or less self-tormenting , and those who desire mere personal comfort should never attempt to cultivate it .

		Despite her success ,
Ellen Terry	PERSON	often feels that she has failed where enthusiastic audiences , and even the most captious critics , testify to the fact that she has triumphed .

		Yet how com - mendable it is that she should feel that any seeming victory in human life is not a final achievement , but a spur -- often a cruel one -- to endless endeavor . ''

		Success , '' says
George William Curtis	PERSON	, '' is a delusion .

		It is an attain - ment -- but who attains ?

		It is the horizon , always bounding our path and therefore never gained .

		The Pope , , triple-crowned , and borne with flabella through St.
Peter	PERSON	's , is not success - ful -- for he might be canonized into a saint .

		Pygmalion , before his perfect statue , is not successful -- for it might live .

		Raphael , fin - ishing the
Sistene Madonna	PERSON	, is not successful , -- for her beauty has revealed to him a finer and an unattainable beauty . ''

		Aside from
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has devoted considerable space in his book to her three gifted sisters ,
Kate	PERSON	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and
Marion	PERSON	, each of whom has won a distinctive place in English theatrical history , but whose names are unfamiliar in this country .


Kate Terry	PERSON	's name is frequently heard associated with that of
Charles Fechter	PERSON	, and there is little doubt that she contributed largely to
Fechter	PERSON	's early Lyceum successes ; she married early , and re - tired into private life .


Marion Terry	PERSON	is yet charming English playgoers with her clever and conscientious work ; she has frequently shared honors with
George Alexander	PERSON	,
Charles Wyndham	PERSON	,
Forbes Robertson	PERSON	, and the Ban - crofts .

		Of
Florence Terry	PERSON	, who died in

		THE DIAL 419 there is always a tendency on the part of the author to dip his pen in rainbows and honey ; but when an artist has gained so high a place in the estimation of the public as has
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, praise which at first may appear ex - travagant is warranted by the general verdict of approval .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has wisely sup - plemented his own records by extracts from contemporary authors ; and on the whole his is a well-made biography , revealing quite fre - quently the writer 's familiarity with the stage and its history .

		The volume is adequately illustrated and attractively printed and bound .


Ingram A. Pyle	PERSON	.

		Crumbs from the
Psychologist	ORGANIZATION	's Tabltc .

		* Professor
James Mark Baldwin	PERSON	has gath - ered together , in a volume entitled '' Fragments in Philosophy and Science , '' a number of essays and addresses which were `` scattered during fifteen years in various journals . ''

		The bond of unity between them is the writer 's individ - uality ; he offers , as it were , samples of him - self .

		In a prefatory note he gives us his '' per - sonal signboard , '' -- his type of philosophy -- in a few clearly-worded sentences . ''

		Science tells us what is true ... Philosophy then enters her questions : how can such truth be also good , beautiful , livable -- or none of these ?

		While others say other things , and many others many other things , I say -- using the liberty of this preface -- it is true and good because it is beautiful ... The ascription of beauty , a reasoned , criticised , thought-out ascription of aesthetic quality , is the final form of our thought about nature , naan , the world , the All . ''

		We are not told , however , what constitutes beauty .

		Perhaps we may say that beauty is harmony realized objectively ; happiness is har - mony realized subjectively .

		So , then , our phi - losophy sees harmony in truth , and ultimately no two or more truths can conflict .

		From the complete realization of truth would come per - fect happiness , and a perfect sense of beauty ; but these would be attributes of God .

		Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	pleads well and strongly for the recognition of philosophy in education , and herein , perhaps , is the chief value of the book .

		Specialists in the sciences have been content to take a narrow view , and it is even held against a man that he has philosophical opinions .

		We have studied bricks , but have no conception of a house .

		the dictionary , and as inchoate .

		We hold a million threads , that lead we know not whither .

		It is the duty of philosophy to harmonize all these elements , to show us the beauty of the cosmos , and our place therein .

		The ultimate purpose of science is to make possible a true philosophy .

		Furthermore , says our author , philosophy is not an intellectual toy , it is a means of under - standing the problems of human life .

		Every man has to solve those problems , one way or another ; and whether he knows it or not , he solves them by his philosophy .

		What , then , if his philosophy is false ?

		What is the use of training thousands of young men and women yearly in our universities , if they come out without a sound and coherent philosophy ?

		For all their knowledge of concrete realities , they will be as chaff blown by the wind .

		This , then , is what the psychologist has to tell us ; but we venture to think that his mes - sage comes from deeper than psychological considerations .

		It should be the message of every scientific man who is not afraid to trust his mind out of his sight .

		Psychology is a science , and , as such , stands in the same rela - tion to philosophy as all the other sciences ; the psychologist can hardly be conceded a spe - cial right-of-way into the philosophical halls .

		Suppose that we are standing in an old cathedral , and looking upwards at the image of a saint in a stained-glass window .

		What is actually taking place ?

		The physicist tells us that rays of light , more correctly called undu - lations of the ether , are passing through the glass and reaching our eyes .

		These undula - tions have different wave-lengths , whereby they are said to be red , blue , yellow , and so forth .

		The result is an image of the saint .

		But what have rays of light to do with saints ?

		Nothing whatever , until our mind intervenes and inter - prets .

		The physiologist will now explain how the light , entering the eye , really goes no further than the retina , but there sets up a disturbance which is communicated to the brain .

		But what has this disturbance to do with saints ?

		The psychologist will now show that the result of the changes transmitted along the optic nerve is a sensation , or bundle of sensations , which we call vision , -- the vision of a picture of a saint .

		So much for the science of the phe - nomenon ; but have we yet a philosophy of it ?

		Can it be said that all this really explains our conscious perception of the saint 's figure , and our receipt thereby of a message from the man , long since dead , who first imagined it ?

		Psy - 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, chology , as a science , deals objectively with the phenomena of the mind , and does not itself construct a philosophy , -- though , like every other science , it affords materials on which philosophy must be based .

		To return to the volume before us ; it con - sists in large measure of contributions to , or discussions of , the science of psychology .

		The term '' science '' in the title is to be interpreted '' psychology . ''

		The close relationship between physiology and psychology is clearly indicated , and has even given rise to the term '' Physio - logical Psychology . ''

		Experiment is taking the place of speculation , and thus bottom is found in what formerly seemed to many a fathomless quicksand .

		Interesting accounts are given of the manner of the experiments , and some of the results .

		In general , one admires the scientific attitude of the experimenters , and wonders at their ingenuity .

		Here and there , some further explanation seems desirable .

		On page 185 Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	says : '' My child H. cried out when I pinched a bottle-cork in her fifth month , and wept bitterly , in her twenty-second week , at the sight of a picture of a man with bowed head and feet in stocks . ''

		We must be forgiven for suggesting that the child 's emotion was the result of a conscious or unconscious ex - pression on the face of the experimenter , and could have been produced just as well without the cork or the picture .

		So again , in chapter XIII .

		are detailed experiments with large classes of students in judging between squares of different sizes , or , rather , in remembering the sizes of particular squares .

		It does not appear that any account is taken of the dis - tance of the observer from the object , nor of the tendency to make random guesses when the squares shown were really of the same size .

		In the latter case , it will be observed , there are three possible alternatives , only one of which is correct , and there is a probability of one of the others being chosen .

		Some indication of this cause of error is given on page 249 .

		It seems a little late in the day to republish an essay on '' Contemporary Philosophy in
France	LOCATION	'' written in
1887	DATE	, and an account of the condition of psychology at the time of the
Chicago Exposition	ORGANIZATION	of
1893	DATE	.

		The average reader of the book is not likely to be able to mentally compare the conditions portrayed with those now extant ; and so will lose their historical interest , while unsatisfied by such belated accounts of the subjects discussed .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		Some American Those who have gone well into the master-painters .

		™ * '' ® ^ * ^ * t '' ^ ^ kes the subject of Mr.
Charles H. Caffin	PERSON	's book en - titled ' < American Masters of Painting '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- will find a striking similarity between the conclusions that he has reached and their own ; while those who have no special knowledge of this kind of art , and view it from without , will find Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	's attitude of mind about it a very reasonable one .

		It is rather to these last -- the many -- than to the specially informed few , that the author ad - dresses himself ; and it is the unique distinction of his book that it presents a closely analytical and even technical study of its subject , in terms that are quite intelligible to people who know nothing about this kind of artistic procedure .

		Opinion about art must be more than expert to be convincing .

		The one who offers it must show that he has thought outside of the particular field of the art he is writing about .

		This it is clear the author has done , and his conclusions are those more secure ones which come from this kind of thinking .

		But it is evident also that he understands the usages as well as the function of painting ; and while his premises are the larger ones of the mind , the critical struc - ture of his work will also be acceptable to special - ized culture , and be found in harmony with the laws that govern picture-making .

		Moreover , the book makes delightful reading , and is as pleasant to the taste as it is convincing to the understanding .

		The selection of the thirteen '' masters '' is no more arbitrary than is inevitable in the best of such dis - tinctions when applied to contemporary art .

		The painters whose genius and work are the subjects of the thirteen brief essays -- averaging thirty-five hundred words each -- that make up the volume of two hundred pages , are at least quite worthy of the close study that Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	has made of them , and in the strictly relative sense implied by the title may be fitly named '' masters . ''

		They are in their order -- an order which seems on the whole to give proper precedence --

Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	.

		Without any dis - guise of technical verbiage , but in words that un - cover his meaning to those unversed in art 's special nomenclature , the writer makes a searching analysis of the art of these men .

		Avoiding the generalities that are the refuge - of vague thought , and that , while applicable , fail to distinguish the individual genius , he gives to each of the thirteen who are the subjects of his '' appreciations '' his own proper place , marking his particular gift in such a way that it can not be confused with any other .

		surface , rather than as an index to an intelligence , will probably find the work too subjective in its analysis ; while those who read a picture less in its own terms than in those of the mind that is in it will find the volume illuminating .

		From this point of view , it seems as interpretative of what is best in American painting as a work of such limited scope can be .

		Mr.
Francis Watt	PERSON	is evidently not of
Froude	PERSON	's opinion as to the un - wisdom of whitewashing the villains of tradition .

		In '' The Terrors of the Law '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- he seeks to show the human and more amiable side of Bloody
Jeffreys	PERSON	, the
Bluidy Advocate Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lord Braxfield	PERSON	, the original of
Stevenson	PERSON	's
Weir	PERSON	of
Hermiston	LOCATION	.

		The point of view is announced as not legal , but '' human or literary . ''

		Law , how - ever , has ever been accounted a jealous mistress , and broad interests or wide culture would seem to retard rather than promote the advancement of the ambitious jurist .

		Hence the dearth of material for popular sketches of these famous , or rather infa - mous , judges .

		Jeffreys -- who has already been whitewashed with no lack of zeal and some degree of success by Mr.
H. B. Irving	PERSON	-- makes a better showing than
Mackenzie	PERSON	; but the tang of Brax - field 's rough Scotch humor renders him the most piquantly interesting of the three .

		The author tries to view each of his characters from the stand - point of a contemporary , and so to temper the judgment of a more refined and enlightened age .

		His defense of Jeffreys furnishes little that is new to a reader of Irving 's book ; but it should be here added that Mr.
Watt	PERSON	, and not Mr.
Irving	PERSON	, is the pioneer in this field , the former having first pub - lished his article in '' The New Review '' two years before the latter 's work appeared .

		The sketch of Braxfield is , the author believes , the fullest account of the man yet published .

		It also first saw the light in `` The New Review . ''

		The paper on
Mackenzie	PERSON	appeared originally in `` The
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxon Review . ''

		These matters of fact are set forth in the preface .

		Kneller 's portraits of
Jeff	PERSON	- reys and
Mackenzie	PERSON	, and
Raeburn	PERSON	's likeness of
Braxfield	LOCATION	, are reproduced , but necessarily on too small a scale for the best effect .

		The delicacy and beauty of
Jeffreys	PERSON	's features , as limned by
Kneller	PERSON	, will never cease to surprise .

		Possibly this artist was too much of '' an utterer of smooth things in paint . ''

		The
last quarter-century	DATE	has given ^ ^ XVreiigion .

		^ ^ ^ ^ tudy of religion as a science a recognized place in the curricula of several great universities . ''

		The Study of Religion '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Professor
Morris Jastrow , Jr.	PERSON	, is a laudable attempt to unfold a method of procedure .

		In order to take up his subject in the right way , he first gives a brief history of the study itself .

		This presents and emphasizes the historical methods as of first importance .

		We have next the classifica - tion of religions , the definitions and the character of it , and a discussion of its origin .

		In the some - what elaborate treatment of this last theme , the author decides that the historical study of religions can not prove that there was a primitive revelation .

		He also shows that neither the '' animistic '' theory of Prof.
E. B. Tylor	PERSON	, nor the `` ghost '' theory of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, provides ample explanation of the origfin of religion .

		The mere personification of nature , too , seems to him to lack a certain spir - itual element which appears to be essential to the rise of a genuine religious feeling in man .

		Briefly , his position is that '' the origin of religion , so far as historical study can solve the problem , is to be sought in the bringing into play of man 's power to obtain a perception of the Infinite through the im - pression which the multitudinous phenomena of the universe as a whole make upon him '' -LRB- p. 196 -RRB- .

		This last statement involves man 's power of study - ing and explaining the phenomena about him , and hence of several departments of modern thought .

		Consequently the second division of the volume deals with religion in its relation to ethics , to phi - losophy , to mythology , to psychology , to history , and to culture in general , -- and to these in the newest phases of their development .

		The last division of the book takes up practical aspects of the question .

		The general attitude of the student must be sympathetic ; he must enter into the life of the peoples who profess belief in such and such re - ligion , if he is to be most proficient in explaining its phenomena .

		He must also be able to study the sources , whether in literature or in the life of any people , as only thereby will he be able to speak authoritatively and to estimate values properly .

		The work is provided with an excellent biblio - graphy of the various phases of the theme , and an ample index .

		Prof.
J. Shield Nicholson	PERSON	has not been idle , as his third and final volume , recently given to the public , witnesses .

		The first volume dealt with Production and Distribution ; the second with
Exchange	ORGANIZATION	.

		This last volume treats of
Economic Progress	ORGANIZATION	and the
Economic Functions of Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Economic students are to be congratulated on the completion of this scholarly and practical work .

		The volume under discussion follows the usual method of Pro- fessor
Nicholson	PERSON	, whose treatment is that of a pro- gressive conservative , and who blends admirably the methods of his masters .

		Smith and Mill .

		The analysis of Progress , in its relation to Population , Money , Prices , Rent , Profits , and Wages , is very good ; although Production , Distribution , and Ex - change fill the field too completely , to the exclusion of Consumption .

		This latter gets due recognition , however , under the discussion of the
Functions of Government	ORGANIZATION	, especially in the masterly balancing of forces between Individualism and
Governmental Interference	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's conservatism is more 422 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, suspicious of the latter than of the former ; and the same attitude of mind appears in the chapter on Free Trade and Protection .

		The presentation of Taxation , Public Expenditure and
Public Credit	ORGANIZATION	is helpfully up to date .

		One of the most interesting chapters is that on Colonies and Dependencies , where the doctrine of
Imperial Federation	ORGANIZATION	is pre - sented in the light of the Boer war , and we are told as a final word that '' instead of seeking to tighten ties , the ideal should be to enlarge the sym - pathies . ''

		This book must be the standard work in English for some years to come .

Lisbon	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Written in the last year of the novelist 's life , during a period of the most intense physical suffering , this record of a vain pilgrimage in search of health yet exhibits Fielding perhaps at his best as far as writing goes , and is animated by a spirit of humor and courage as un - failing as that which moves in the pages of '' Tom Jones '' or ``

		To have this work in the beautiful setting just given it by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,

Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	is a piece of good fortune for which book - lovers should be duly grateful .

		The volume is an octavo of something over two hundred pages , printed upon
Dickinson	PERSON	handmade paper from a new font of type of uncommon attractiveness .

		The typographical treatment of the text is severely simple , and with the exception of a photogravure reproduction of
Hogarth	PERSON	's portrait -LRB- the only au - thentic likeness of Fielding in existence -RRB- there is a total absence of extraneous embellishment or decoration in the book .

		Its distinction rests en - tirely upon a basis of sound taste and correct workmanship , -- a combination which must always achieve the best results .

		This tasteful reprint of Fielding 's last work is issued in a limited edition of three hundred copies , all of which , we understand , were taken up in advance of publication .

H. J. Mackinder	PERSON	's ``
Britain	LOCATION	and the British Seas '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , the initial volume of a series under Mr.
Mackinder	PERSON	's editorship and intended to present descriptive es - says of twelve great natural regions of the earth .

		Mr.
Mackinder	PERSON	is a geographer , and '' Reader in Geography in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But with him , geography is far more than what the school - boys of half a century were taught , -- '' a descrip - tion of the earth 's surface . ''

		Mr.
Mackinder	PERSON	's pur - suit of his favorite science has led him far beneath the surface of the earth and over a wide expanse of the
North Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	.

		He finds it to include astronomical or mathematical geography , and a knowledge of the processes by which the world came into being ; and he recognizes its relation to geol - ogy , and that it is divisible into the several depart - ments of racial , historical , strategetic and economic geography .

		The British Isles comprise the small - est of the twelve natural divisions selected for this scientific treatment , but their physical features are so thoroughly known that they furnish an admir - able subject for a leader in this proposed series of geographical syntheses .

		The volume sets a stand - ard which the authors of the subsequent volumes will find it difficult to maintain ; but if the other volumes are anything like this in breadth of treat - ment , the value of the series as contributions to our knowledge of the world will be beyond estimation .

		Maps in color and in black-and-white , and notes and indexes , are so generously supplied that they more than illustrate the subject -- they illuminate it .

		In translating Professor
Friedrich Life	PERSON	and doetrmes
Paulgen	PERSON	's `` Life and Doctrines of of
Immanuel Kant	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ , , / c < - l \ - kit ImmanuelKant -LRB- ocribner -RRB- , Messrs.
Creighton	PERSON	and
Lefevre	PERSON	, of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, have done an invaluable service to English students of the great German metaphysician .

		The book aims to set forth the central doctrines of the Kantian system , laying especial stress upon the often neg - lected constructive side of the philosophy , upon its positive and idealistic elements and its lofty moral concepts .

		The short but significant introduction deals with
Kant	PERSON	's position , first in the history of philosophical thought , and next in the thought of his own time .

		A brief account of his life and mental development follows ; and finally an expo - sition of his system , which occupies three-fourths of the book .

		Intended especially for the student who is attempting a systematic mastery of the Critiques , this section is still not beyond the depth of the gen - eral reader , while its abundant divisions and head - ings make it particularly useful for consultation upon some one doctrine or some small division of
Kant	PERSON	's work .

		The author 's appreciation of
Kant	PERSON	's great contribution to modern thought does not blind him to idiosyncrasies of form or inconsistencies of content .

		So his book is of value both as an expo - sition of
Kant	PERSON	's work and as an authoritative opinion of it based upon the results of recent Kantian studies in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Thomas E. Watson	PERSON	's life of
Napoleon	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which suc - ceeds his '' Story of
France	LOCATION	'' and is uniform with it in style and size of volume , will be no disappointment to the admirers of the earlier effort .

		The author has emphatically disclaimed recourse to new material , or the attempt to put new facts before the public .

		His life of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is based wholly on many well-known , easily accessible , An American life of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	.

		1902 . -RSB-

		THE JDIAJL 423 but sometimes notoriously unauthoritative sources .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's powers of discrimination have not been expended in eliminating the false and untrust - worthy , but rather in culling out the dull and occa - sionally the damning facts of his hero 's career .

		For
Napoleon	PERSON	is the hero , and the attitude of the author is that of the champion and defender against the taken-for-granted malignancy of his reader .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, however , is never more wholly himself , never more successful , than when in arms for a favorite theory or character ; so we have him at his best .

		The story of the life of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is ex - ceedingly well told in the always attractive style of the author , whose forcible personality is constantly in evidence .

		There is endless interesting gossip , bright characterization , eloquent denunciation or vindication , as the case demands .

		For the general reader we have , then , an uncommonly attractive life of
Napoleon	PERSON	, even if the author has failed to give us history for the historian .

		Methods for the No branch of anatomical investiga - ttudyofthe tion has made more rapid advances nervou !

		^ syHem .

		j ^ recent years than the study of the nervous system .

		This rapid growth in the science of neurology has been almost wholly conditioned by the discovery of new methods of research which have opened new fields for exploration and corrected the misconceptions of the past .

		The nervous sys - tem is one of the moat complicated in the vertebrate body , and a knowledge of its architecture is of great importance not only to physicians but also to anat - omists , zoologists , physiologists , and psychologists .

		All of these classes will welcome Mr.
Hardesty	PERSON	's little manual of methods , `` Neurological Technique '' -LRB-
Chicago University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is the outgrowth of experience in the neurological laboratory of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and is designed to meet the needs of all who would attempt the study of the gross or finer structure of the nervous system by modern methods .

		To obviate the confusion which has arisen in anatomical literature from the use of various names for the same structure , the author has adopted the nomenclature recommended by the
Basel Commission of Anatomists	ORGANIZATION	, and gives a full list of the terms applicable to the nervous system and sense organs .

		The life and ■ art-work of Mr.
WhUller	PERSON	, In the volume entitled ''
James Mc	PERSON	-
Neill Whistler	PERSON	, the Man and his Work '' -LRB-
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
W. G. Bowdoin	PERSON	presents a brief and well-written sketch of the principal facts of the painter 's life , a collection of characteristic anecdotes , and a list of
Whistler	LOCATION	prints in the Avery Collection at the
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it is refined harmony of page , binding , and illustration of the book that first catches the eye , and makes the most lasting impression .

		Mounted on heavy dark-brown paper and bound in at the end of the book are half-tone reproductions of some of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's most interesting pictures ; and similarly mounted as a frontispiece is a repro - duction of the well-known portrait of
Whistler	LOCATION	by
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	.

		The numerous
Whistler	LOCATION	controver - sies are here barely alluded to .

		With the pen as well as with the brush , Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	has been one of the great forces in contemporary art , and this book is welcome for its presentation of his peculiar and abiding influence .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The English-Spanish section of the revised
Veldsquez Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	has just been published by the Messrs. Ap - pleton , following the other section after an interval of about a year .

		The editors are Messrs.
Edward Gray	PERSON	and
Juan L. Iribas	PERSON	.

		We open it at random , and come upon such definitions as `` copper , va. en el juege de foradn , etc. '' and '' dude , s. petimetre , '' from which examples the thoroughness of the work may be judged .

		This is undoubtedly the best dictionary of Spanish and English now in existence . ''

		The International Year Book '' for
1901	DATE	, the fourth annual issue of this useful work of reference , has just been published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is edited , as before , by Mr.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	, with the collaboration of Professor
H. T. Peck	PERSON	and Mr.
E. L. Engle	PERSON	.

		The plan remains substantially unchanged , although certain classes of statistical matter relating to the States have been made into special articles , instead of being scattered in forty-five places .

		A great deal of census material , as well as of legislative enactment , has been made use of in this volume .

		There are a dozen maps , and thirty or forty other plates .

		The in - dex , which is cumulative , becomes more and more valuable with every year . ''

		The '' Warwick Library '' is a series that has for some time numbered six volumes , and to these a seventh has just been added , the work of Professor
C. H. Her	PERSON	- ford , the editor of the series .

		Each volume of this library , it will be remembered , deals with one literary form in English literature , which is illustrated by a number of examples , prefaced by an elaborate intro - ductory essay . ''

		English Tales in Verse '' is the sub - ject of the new volume , which is imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, The authors represented are Chaucer , Shake - speare ,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and Mor - ris , there being sixteen tales in all , five of them Chau - cerian .

		As might be expected by those who are familiar with the editor 's writing , the introductory essay is a fine example of readable and discriminating literary criticism .

		The second volume of '' Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Georg Bran	PERSON	- des , has just appeared in the English version .

		This volume has for its special subject '' The Romantic School in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' and was first published in
1873	DATE	.

		Being based upon fundamental principles of criticism , instead of reflecting temporary fashions , it is practically as valuable to-day as it was thirty years ago .

		The movement described is that in which
Tieck	PERSON	and the Schlegels , ''
Jean Paul	PERSON	'' and '' Novalis , ''
Schleiermacher	PERSON	and
Schelling	PERSON	, are the representative figures .

		The treatment of '' Novalis , '' in particular , is one of the most penetrating pieces of criticism ever penned .

		The subject of the volume next to follow is '' The Reaction in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		It is a very elementary book , suited for grammar schools rather than for those of higher grade .

		Mr.
Buel P. Colton	PERSON	's '' Elementary Physiology and Hygiene , '' published by
